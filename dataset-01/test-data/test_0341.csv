2,Time to give up,"I dont see this as any kind of return to form; the statement which convinced me to pick this up. These guys lost it back in 2000. Far too streamlined, a lack of any real guitar prowess, and weakened songwriting. There are so many more bands breaking through at the moment (metalcore aside) many of which surpass the current material these old timers are producing.Unless anything from Clayman onwards was your sort of thing, you'd do well to avoid this."
5,"A melodic metal masterpiece, and one of the best metal albums of 2006","Two words: simply stunning! This album was a turning point for In Flames, as it is the first to feature and emphasize Anders singing abilities from start to finish. Anders has a very distinctive voice, one that can range from death metal/cookie monster growls, screams, and singing. He is, undoubtedly, one of the most poignant and powerful frontmen in metal today. The guitar work between Jesper and Bjorn is fantastic with plenty o' harmonized riffs and solos galore, and incredible drum work by Daniel Svensson. The more I listen to this album, the more I am amazed by it. Many fans of their early work may not get or like this album because of the new direction they decided to take on it, but this is one of the few Gothenberg metal bands that continues to progress for the better. Too bad I can't say the same for Soilwork."
2,"its okay, but its defintly not ""their most creative and heaviest albumn to date""","I started listening to In Flames back during Whoracle and lunar strain. THe last cd I picked up till this one was Reroute to Remain. I saw the sticker on the cd saying that it was In Flames most creative and metal influenced cd to date. Well whoever wrote that must be from mainstream radio listeners. None of it is as heavy as Whoracle or any of their earlier works, the only song that comes close to reaching the early days sound is ""pacing deaths trail"", the rest do sound kind of mainstreamed, and sometimes the guy is singing and not screaming, one of the songs I actually thought was by Coheed and Cambria cause it was some slow ass rift and it sounded like a girl singing,not the same, and dont believe the sticker."
5,A good album,"I've been a fan of In Flames for a little while now. I wasn't that big of a fan until I saw them live, and they played some songs off this one. I knew right then I had to have this album. It starts off strong and ends with that strength.I would like to them go back to what they were doing before. Until then I will be rocking this."
5,In Flames Returns With a Vengance,"Come Clarity is just that, they return to the heavy sound and well written lyrics that thrust them into the metal world. This is probably their best cd since Colony, and it in some ways is even better than that. This is easily one of the best cds that will come out in 06'. The song ""dead end"" is one of the best songs I have ever heard, the girls vocals are amazing and add so much to the song. In general there is really no ""bad"" song on the cd, except #6. If you have never heard In Flames, or if you thought they were done, get this cd and you'll be amazed. Stay Metal and F*ck Hip HOP \m/ \m/"
3,Not much for such a band...(European headbanger),"Come Clarity is a nice album, from one of the greatest european metal bands...but that's it. Post production of this album sucks, as well as vocals, but my 3 star rating its because of In Flames return to the good death metal sound."
4,A good read.,"If you are a Shannara follower, this is a must read. Terry Brooks stay faithful with the past. Looking forward to the next book."
4,"Good, but not great...","I think that this book is well written in typical Terry Brooks style. However, I find myself missing the organic feel of the previous Shannara books (forest and nature versus metal and man-made things). I understand that you can't retell the same type of story over and over again, but it left a little to be desired. I also felt that we never really got to enjoy Walker as a Druid enough to really appreciate his character. Overall, it's a decent read if you're a Brooks fan."
2,this is crap,I would not even give it to a child it is a piece of crap. Horribly cheap product that not worth it.
5,Why this book is great,"This is a good book for several reasons. Firstly, it is interesting. Secondly, it is very interesting. Thirdly, it is sooooo interesting. Fourthly, I liked it 'cause it was just soooooooooooo interesting!"
3,3 inch boxer jock,"Love that its under armour, but HATE the fact that the inseam is so short that it rides up and feels like a pair of briefs. I either spend all day with my hand down my pants or walk around with odd underwear lines. do yourself a favor and get the six or nine inch inseams"
3,Not what I had hoped....,"I had hoped for a coherent ""doctrine"" or plan of action for transformational change in urban schools. Instead... I was taken through a treatise on how Ms. Monroe traveled her path with some anecdotes. The closet thing to a doctrine were unattributed (were they hears or others) quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Ms. Monroe is apparently charismatic and some of her ability to affect change seems to be attributable to her charisma. I wanted to hear the story of how she changed and sustained learning at these two schools.. I didn't get that. Perhaps there is more yet to be learned about and from her as she comes highly recommended by some of my peers who have been very successful and changing and sustaining positive results at challenging schools here in San Francisco."
5,EASY clean up,"This mop was recommended to me by a friend and I am sooo glad she did! There is something ""magic"" in the looping of the mophead - it really grabs the dirt. The swivel head makes getting into tight and small places very easy. I have even used it to clean a foyer window that is 2 stories high and it worked perfectly. No mess, no buckets, no sloshing around! Just spray the solution of your mixing or choice, dampen the mophead, wipe, then rinse with water & dish soap or put mophead in washer. Cleans up great. Would definitely recommend this especially for those who are tired of the subpar products that go unused in our closets!"
5,Just as reviewed - this thing is GREAT!,"I add my praise to all the other positive reviews.As ""must love dogs Lucy"" from Texas said in the title of her review, the glowing reviews of this mop are NOT shams!This thing really does work, and it works EXTREMELY well.Even my ever-skeptical husband was impressed six ways from Friday the very first time he used it (and every time since as well).Tougher, more stubborn debris and dirt cleans right up without a jot of elbow grease on our parts.Absolutely amazing device. I just wish (OH HOW I WISH) I had discovered it LONG ago! Life would have been so much easier!"
5,It works!,"This mop works really well for me. I have hardwood, marble, stone and tile floors and 2 dogs and a cat. I'm always buying mops. This is the best I've found so far. The fact that you only need water makes it easy and convenient to use. It goes around corners and furniture legs very well. I vacuum first then use this and it works very well. You do however really need more than one mop head to make it really convenient or you are waiting for the next load of laundry for a clean mop head."
3,Need better quality of the handle,"I bought this microfiber mob three months ago. My husband loves it because it is so light and really picks the dirt, crumbs and absorb the water. Safe time to clean up the house. Those are the positive things about this mob. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with strong handle, the quality of the handle material looks cheap actually and that was my concern when we first thought to but it. And what we thought was right, the handle broke after my husband used it about three times. Now we think about buy something stronger to replace the handle for we can use the mob again.I wish they reconsider the handle as well as the mob and make it in better quality.If the handle could last at least a year I might give 5 stars. So if you someone who doesn't like to fix a broken stuff this mob definitely not for you."
1,Save your money! DO NOT BUY THIS,I am Mystified anyone reviewed this mop favoribly. It is flimsy. You can't fit it in any bucket so you have to keep walking back to the sink. It does not pick up ANYTHING not even dog hair. So plan on vaccuming the whole floor first. I get more done with a swifter if i want to do a quick clean up. Total rip off!
4,Not great,"It's an ok protuct but maybe my expectations were too high. It's not magic, still takes some work to clean well."
1,Beware of flim flammers,"Beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop. Although microfiber mops are relatively new, major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs. In order to standout from all the competition, five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops. Google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews. Fortunately the ""reviews"" were fabricated about a month ago so, hopefully, not too many customers have been deceived. My experience has been that most reviewers give, helpful honest reviews."
1,Burnt out in 4 months,"After 4 months of use, the unit burnt out. Inquiry from Amazon about warranty information was ignored. Piece of junk."
4,IS last season,A great last season. I do wish there were more deleted scenes. I also was hoping for a alternet ending.
3,"It has a very strong, bad smell.","In short, it stinks. It's coated with mold on the outside of the casing which may be the cause of the smell. It's chewier, and less salty than American styled salami, which is good. It tasted okay, good even. Not $16.99 good though. Eating pork in any form is an event for me, but I was curious based on the reviews. Curiosity is satisfied, I would not order it again."
5,beautiful,"This CD is one of the greatest works of art I have ever heard, it hasn't left my CD player. About a month ago I didn't even know who Poe was and now I am addicted. Songs like ""Haunted"", ""Amazing"", and ""Could Have Gone Mad"" are songs of perfection. I adore this CD, it's full of personal words and great music."
1,Poe is cool,Poe is my favrite band. I like all the talking in the song. It os very cool. The talking sounds neat. It is better than music becus i like listening 2 talking
5,"Absolutely ""haunting""","This is one of my all time favorite albums. A ""must have"". I think it's 100 times better than her first album. Two favorite tracks are ""Haunted"" (the lyrics are amazing), and ""Spanish Doll"". I love this album so much and wish she's release a new one, the wait is torturous! Buy it!"
3,"Yeah, I saw the cookie jar...","I heard ""Hey Pretty"" (the Drive-By Mix)on the radio and thought it was a good song and later started humming the song without even noticing it.I have listened to this CD a while and although I don't rate it the highest, this CD is really good. The reason why I rate it so high is because I haven't found more than a few songs that have really got in my head yet. Or maybe I'm not listening hard enough(?)The songs that I really liked were songs like ""Not a Virgin"" and ""Lemon Meringue"". They are cool songs.Listen, if you like artists like Fiona Apple or Tori Amos, like other reviewers have mentioned, then this CD will be your new best friend. Even if this is not one of my absolute favorites, it is still a CD worth to own. End of Review."
5,POE at her usual self.... Dynamic & Talented!,"I can't praise her work enough... I've replaced this album 4 times for myself personally, and bought another 3 for friends. It's a must have! It's touching, it's whitty, it's romantic, it's all over the map! All I can say, listen to her words carefully.... Once you listen carefully you'll be hooked! I wish she would hurry up with the next cd =) BTW: Hello is a great introduction, but Haunted really shines her talents, neither you will regret having..."
5,Music Therapy,I bought this album after seeing Poe open for Depeche Mode listening to her speak of her child hood brought back alot of my ghosts that had been hiding. I listened to this album overand over and found as a song writter myself that it had a theraputic value to it. Just like Tori Amos's little earthquakes deals with rape Haunted dealt with loss and child hood issues. Even after dealing with all these things I still find myself in the groove Poe went for and look forward to any new releases from her in the future
5,Love It!!!,"I had never really heard of Poe until I started reading House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski. I had taken it to my cousins house because it was the sort of thing that was right up her alley and she immediately pulled out Haunted due to the similar song title and look of the cd. We soon read about the connection of the two and she let me borrow the disk. I was hooked from the first listen. This is a cd that I never get tired of listening to. It follows me everywhere (work, car, home, etc...) I have since listened to Hello as well, but Haunted remains my fav of the two as well as one of my favorite albums period."
4,Very readable - and surprisingly good view of Life in Rome,"I've been reading a lot of Roman history lately and got this book as a gift. It is very readable, and very entertaining. One of the things a most histories miss are the lives of the regular people. We all know about the Ceasars, but how did the regular people live? What was it really like? This book, with illustrations and text, tries to tell the reader - and succeeds."
2,Disappointing,"My 6- and 8-year-old grandchildren, both avid readers of classic books, were not interested in this one. It's sitting on the shelf."
4,House of Praise by Carmen CD,"This is an excellent CD that has been around for awhile. I was replacing a copy we had before, that is worn out."
5,Japanese Classic,"This book is great, an awesome read for lovers of Japanese Classics and those studying Japanese history or culture. With my other Japanese Classic literature it tops off my collection."
1,Disconnects,"This mouse keyboard combo is nice sized, but both have issues. The bluetooth actually loses connectivity to the mouse and/or the mouse response becomes sluggish. You have to hold the mouse next to the PC to get it to reset (I didn't need a reboot like the other reviewer). They keyboard is fine, except if you ever boot up and need to hit F6 or verify hardware changes, it will not work - you need to use a USB keyboard as this model doesn't start up until Windows has booted. Nice idea with no cords, but immature technology. I'm surprised Dell even sells these."
5,Good Buy,"Works just as expected. Bought to go with an Audiovox portable DVD player so my kids could watch on the airplane (model I got didnt come with a battery -which is odd in and of itself). But it comes with 5 different adapters to use with a huge variety of appliances. Charges fast ad works for about 3 hours. The louder the volume on the dvd player the shorter the time you get but not that big of a difference. Also if there are two screens, like I have, the battery goes a little faster. But overall definitely worth the purchase."
1,Caveat Emptor,"Charged this ""9.6"" volt battery up, then measured the voltage: 11.43 volts. Just enough to fry my nice expensive electronics. I give my multimeters 5 stars. As for this battery, can anyone direct me to the nearest recycling bin?"
2,WWII Pacific Advance Base - DVD,"This item is of marginal quality and for the price ($1.00 a minute), I would suggest there is a better way to spend your money. Frankly, I was disappointed. Not for the hard core history buff. Much of the footage came across as action for actions sake; no story line to amount to anything."
3,Pretty good. . .but could be better,"This monitor is pretty good for the money. The picture is clear and it's easy to work. Downsides: 1) there's no battery-life gauge on the handset, so all you get is a reddish light for about 5 minutes, then it dies 2) we're in an apartment and someone's crappy cell phone interferes with it. Daily, the signal dies because of it. We had an audio monitor before and we still have to use it because of the interference, but other than the above 2 things, it's worked really well."
1,Not so good baby monitor,The baby monitor did not work well at all in my house. The video signal was always scrambled and there was lots of static. Whenever it did get a clear signal it was only for a short amount of time and the color looked grey (black and white).
1,Such a dull compilation.,"I expected so much more from this recording. I mean, the Pointer Sisters, I thought, are aptly legendary, as the album title says; but, this Australian release compilation is such a dud, except for the extended remixes on the third CD. This makes one think of them as nothing compared to other pop trios like Exposé and Company B, who had much better music. Skip this one, I'm definitely giving some other compilation another try for this ""legendary"" trio. Blah!"
3,bombs truck,on line with the warbird tech series standardsa little bit too oriented on the single seat versions and not enough on the wild wessel
1,"Taketh this Soul, please","I had to fast foward to ""see"" all the hype, which was really just some women standing in awe when dude doesn't even drop his pants. Some fake moans, some fake orgasms can't keep this film limping along. The acting was over the top, awful, and gives blaxploitation a bad name."
1,Leave this mess alone!,"Folks, if you love Laurel and Hardy, you probably have all of the stuff on here that matters.Much of this is the ubiqitous public domain stuff you can find anywhere else, with some REALLY BAD silent ""comedies"" made before the teaming of Laurel and Hardy.""Lucky Dog,"" the first comedy with L&H; appears, but only HALF THE FILM is shown. This weak collection stops after the robbery scene that marks L&H;'s debut.""Utopia"" and ""Flying Deuces,"" which appear in almost every L&H; DVD collection, are here for the ride (which will be exactly what you'll be taken on if you waste money on this set).In other words, don't bother. Superior collections of L&H; exist."
2,Blessedly Brief,"I suppose that The Klingon Gambit isn't the worst Trek book out there. After all, I managed to finish it very quickly and, despite some eye-rolling, I didn't mind it while I was reading it. Ultimately, the book is inane and the solution is both obvious and trite."
4,Beem this book up!,"What can I say? I'm a Trek fan and can't get enough of it. While this book will not win a Pulitzer or Nobel prize, its a worthwhile edition to the Trek world."
1,Tweezer review,"These tweezers are mediocre at best. They do not grip fine hairs or tiny splinters. At best, these tweezers are good for larger hairs or items. They are definitely no of professional quality."
1,Relentlessly depressing,"In Lucia's Eyes is beautifully, lyrically written. The characters are interesting. The story is so depressing I could hardly make myself finish it. It is a testament to the author's skillful writing that I kept going until the end. It was a big disappointment, after I had read The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi, which was not exactly a happy story, but it ended on a note of hope and and calm. (Maybe it helps that I have lived for many years in Ghana, the birthplace of the title character of that book.)Anyway, In Lucia's Eyes is not a book that I would hand to a friend, not a book that I want very much to remember, because it was actually painful to read. But then Christmas Coke commercials with lovely singing chidren from around the world make me cry, so maybe you want to discount my comments. Obviously the book made an impression, and that's what great writing is supposed to do."
3,HAIR NO MORE,"In general this product does work.BUT potential skin rashes, bad smell, and taking longer to apply than just shaving. I went back to shaving right away. Tested an area on my arm for 3 weeks. No noticable reduced hair regrowth."
4,"Chile Can Do Dark Comedy, Too","I caught part of this on cable, but was never able to catch the whole so bought my own copy. In both cases the movie is in Spanish with subtitles, I found it interesting that the translations were different between the two versions. In either case it is a very entertaining dark comedy with a twist in the middle that covers all the events twice from different perspectives. From my American perspective it is also interesting to see life in Chile, peopled with the same useless louts, emasculating girlfriends and closet psychopaths we have up here. Makes the world seem smaller somehow. A great movie I made my family watch and would highly recommend."
3,lost fascination quickly,I bought this for the Princess of the Universe and she loved it. For about an hour. Since then she's played with it a couple times. Mostly she ignores it. It lacks the interactive people touch that can keep a toy interesting.so it's okay for a while.....
3,my cat lost interest,"he played less than one hourand he ignored it.so I started to use this for his food bowlI put his food inside this toy, and he did not get his food easilyI did same every day, he doesn't have any problem to get food from toyso, it may make your cat little smarter"
3,"Sheer musical overkill, but still good.","Quite literally, this is overkill. All of the songs on it are so god-awfully impressive that it gets to the point where you wanna say, ""enough is enough."" Billy Cobham is surely overplays the drums more than any one person has a right to, and John McLaughlin plays like a soul possesed by Mercury himself. Although there are some genuinely amazing tracks on this record, like ""Meeting of the Spirits,"" ""The Long Noonward Race,"" and ""Dance of the Maya,"" much of the rest is just too much (and this coming from a fellow who has a huge love in his heart for Dream Theater records)."
5,The most capable handheld available,"I have been using the Psion Series 5 for over a year. I find it to be faster at accessing the information I want (agenda or contacts) than other PDAs. It synchronizes well with outlook on my PC in the office. Clients are amazed that they receive a follow-up letter from me the day after a call, even though I am still on the road. I e-mail from the Series 5 it to my assistant who prints it on letterhead and overnight ships it. The ability to insert graphs into my correspondence helps as well for my line of work.With add on software I now have full control over my project and time management and financial lives.My Psion is great! If it could only increase my salary for me as well...."
5,Not as Corny as You'd think!,"Alright, so there are lots of the typical ""How many soprano does it take to change a lightbulb?"" type jokes in here, but they're elegantly spaced out with some brilliant, technical and obscure jokes that clearly come from trained musicians. There's enough corniness to make even the most easygoing muso groan, and at the same time there are some jokes that are hysterical, and very familiar to those who work in the industry... ;)The jokes are sorted by instruments and groups, with extra sections at the end for those oddities who don't fit in anywhere else (conductors, accordians, techies...)A great collection!"
3,Okay,I read this book because I loved Replay and I thought this one was just okay. The story starting out interesting but I just hated the ending. I felt sorry for the husband and the other good characters and felt let down at the ending. I thought this book would be better than it was. Don't buy the book.
3,Not for short people,I have it - and it works well. until it is time to replace the filter But because I am short - I have to stand on my tip toes to remove the shower head completely and then I can replace the filter. It is very frustrating for me - because I am afraid it will leak when I screw it back on.
1,A prompt replacement,"well,i'm pretty sure i would have liked it!i like the concept..however,i ordered a new one,paid for a new one & there is no doubt in my mind this vendor send a used or sent back item.so the vendor gets an F+ for trying to pull that over on me!i'll be calling credit card resolutions hotline and he will not be paid!this is awful!the filters come with paper seals,(and it had none at either end!)plus it was so dusty,i started sneezing in less than 5 seconds!.send me a new one or at least one you can't grown corn on!unexceptable.not to mention unsanitary!!!!!!!!!!######UPDATE,UPDATE 2/16/13 After the seller answered my question,he very promptly put another in the mail for me!I WOULD do business with them again."
1,You can find better filtered shower heads.,This shower head leaked water from multiple locations. By leaked i mean sprayed high pressured streams in multiple directions. I found a much better filtered shower head at Lowe's.
2,Lasted for 1 year then plastic neck broke.,"This shower filter adapter was an inexpensive way to filter my shower water. We loved it, as the water did not feel as harsh and even smelled better. Unfortunately the neck of the adapter that screws in to the piping, developed a leak. Not more than 2 weeks after, the shower head simply broke off at the adapter connection. The plastic is simply not made to last for very long. Oh well, will be purchasing the hand held filtered shower head from Culigan to replace the plastic one."
5,Soft skin after showering,"Easy to install (less than 10 minutes) and great results from it. My skin used to be dry and required lotion, baby oil, etc. after showering but not any more. My skin feels great and flexible due to the filter removing the chlorine from my tap water.This is a great gift for your skin! I highly recommend it!"
4,"New, but not improved","It may be psychological, but I think the older version that this filter replaced works better. If I had a choice, I'd stick with the old longer filters. The new style is easier to install because you don't have to remove the filter to get the unit on the pipe."
5,You don't know what your missing!,"I admit I was skeptical when my hippie friends told me about the terrible effects of chlorine in the water, so outfitted two of my 3 showers with this. The third shower is never used so figured why bother. I did not feel any difference or smell any difference when I put the filters on in the quality of my water, skin, hair etc. It felt like nothing had changed. Well, after 6 months of use I had to take a shower in the shower that did not have a filter. It was horrible, the smell of chlorine was like swimming pool water, plus I could smell the chlorine in the steam, it made me want to gag!! I never knew how much toxic stuff is in our water supply. I am no longer a skeptic! I also got a reverse osmosis unit for cooking, don't drink the chlorine and other junk either."
2,Easy To Install But Not Much Of A Difference,"I recently moved and noticed that my hair was suffering from the ""hard"" water. I have purchased a shower filter in the past and did notice a difference (I dont remember the brand). However, with this Culligan filter I do not notice a difference in my hair. It was quite easy to install, and the tape is provided, but I dont think I will purchase refills for this filter, instead I will purchase a different kind."
3,Does the trick,"First off, the great thing about this product is that it doesn't require you to get a new shower head. It incorporates your existing shower head. The chlorine smell is definitely gone and I feel good knowing my skin is not being attacked my harsh minerals and chemicals. The two complaints I have is that it doesn't purify your water like brita or zerowater and out of the three I bought, one of them lets water leak through. Otherwise, great product."
4,Does the job,"Does the job - gets rid of the chlorine, easy to install. Pressure drops a little, but that's OK, it saves on water use!"
3,Its OK,"Our local water is treated with Chloramine. Although it doesn have much of a chlorine odor, it is somewhat harsh on hair. I was expecting the filter to minimize the affect and make the water less harsh, but it doesn't seem to make any difference."
3,too academic to be of practical use,"This book is too academical to be of any practical use.I have read about 60% of the book and I could not find anything that I could actually use.This is the problem with books written by academics or people who have not actually done software development in the past 5 years, or so.This problem becomes even worse when the authors are working for the Software Engineering Institute - SEI (the guys who believe in methodology above anything else).This is book is filled with classifications and very terse or abstract statements.I would not recommend it to anybody who actually hopes to learn something they can apply at work.Another recommendation: if you want to read good, down to earth books, avoid those written by people working for SEI."
4,Good study guide,"I think that this is a good study guide. There are a couple of problems with study questions and answers being misnumbered, but they are not, in fact incorrect. An observant reader will quickly notice this and account for it, otherwise the book is great."
5,beware of hungry ghosts bearing gifts...,"I received this CD as a promo several years ago while employed at a record shop. One of many CDs I received in this manner, listened to a few times and passed on to friends......except this one I kept, and listened to again and again. Odd, considering I'm no electronica afficionado. This is definitely not your garden variety 4/4 beats. Compositions are short but superbly developed. The music has an organic feel, as of live instruments delicately cut-and-pasted and looped. The crackly turntablism and evocative violin crop up at just the right places. It has basslines Tortoise would be proud of. It made me go out and buy ""Veiculo"" and ""Amateur View."" All three albums are highly enjoyable and reward repeated listens. This is warm, inviting listening with lots of subtleties. I want their whole catalog!"
4,A Good Sherlock Holmes Read,"This book was a good read in the Sherlock Holmes tradition. I liked the author's reasoning concerning the ""Jack the Ripper"" murders in London--I think he was correct in deducing the manner in which they were killed. I think the author dwelled a little too much on the accounts of the Ripper murders, although I understood the need to ""set the stage."" For all I know, the author may have solved the Ripper murders! But aside from all of that, I felt like I was reading a Sherlock Holmes novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I did miss Dr. Watson in this story. I really think you need active and constant interaction between Holmes and Watson to have the best ""Sherlock Holmes"" story. Holmes did ""relate"" aspects of the story to Watson, but it was after the fact and not in real time. Perhaps the best recommendation I can give this book is to say it's a ""page turner,"" and it is hard to put down. This is definitely a book for fans of Sherlock Holmes!"
3,It did the job!,"My son (Mr. CSI) likes it, but I've seen better products. I thought the product could have been a little better."
1,Not worth the money,It broke the second day! My son loves to play spy so we got it for him the next day it was broken. What a waste!
2,"Neat idea, bad packaging/delivery","Glasses are a great gift for a little pretend spy, but I was very disapointed that they came pitted with rust marks on the mirrors. My son really liked them but he noticed it right away and said that even though they were fun, they were too cheap."
4,It works,"You look kind of funny, but it does what it says so kids are shocked when you know what they are doing behind your back"
1,wasnt happy with it at all.,It broke the day i got it.. its fully plastic with faded mirrors on the side of them so you can see behind you. Wouldn't of wasted my money on this if i knew it would've broken a couple days after i got it..
3,Good Fun for kids,"I have a 2 yr and 7 yr, who had good fun with these glasses. Even their friends who occasionally come over to play, like these glasses."
4,spy gear,Great cheap stocking stuffer for the spy in your family! Not very sturdy but for this price it is plenty amusing!
1,Kind of Sucks,"I purchased this game this weekend at Target for a dinner get together I was having. This game, for lack of a better word, sucks. The questions are way too easy, and all the clips on the DVD were either INXS, David Bowe, Queen or Wham. Like another reviewer said, it seemed like the DVD was on a loop of the same 10 videos. Also, it seemed to focus mostly on the very early 80's. The low point of the game is when there was a ""name that group"" category question on the DVD , and the video clip they showed actually had a banner that said Wham! behind George Michael dancing! It was really sad. This game is a waste of time for it's $34.00 price tag. Get Trivial Pursuit Pop Culture edition, it's much more fun and diverse."
1,Don't Buy This Game!,This was such a disappointment! It seemed like the dvd was on a loop of the same 10 videos. The questions on the cards were fun and diverse but it is really a shame the dvd portion was lacking.
1,Don't waste your money,The game board portion is too easy. The DVD has very few clips and you see the same ones over and over. Just guess INXS or Wham and you'll likely get the answer right.
2,Ok for beginners,"This book is a bit older but most fundamentals still apply. As a league bowler I know there is alot of important info here but with all of the other tools available, this is not the best option."
2,Good cleaner. Poor quality.,"This is my second Hoover machine. They clean well. This one cleans better than the first one, but the cleaning tank leaks and the handle on the dirty tank broke off. $57 to replace the tank, so I passed on that. The attachments on this one is completely detachable so it is not as compact and convenient as the first model. I am undecided on whether I will go with Hoover again. I have an old dog so I have to have something. The unit is very loud."
1,Avoid this machine,"I used this shampooer on 3 carpets only one time. I tried to use it about a month later and the brushes have rusted so badly they don't spin. Unfortunately I didn't take it back to the store for a full refund when I first purchased it. The brushes seized up for a short time (but started working)when I tried to resume shampooing carpets after letting it sit overnight.According to the serviceman (it is still under warranty) he said this is a bad redesign and happens frequently. He told me this may keep reoccurring and it will cost $40.00 for the part (not under warranty) and $50.00 to install it. There is nothing you can do to eliminate the rusting of the sealed bearings. He also mentioned throwing it out. This is just what I wanted to hear after spending over $225.00. I also wrote Hoover asking for my money back, we'll see."
3,The water tank does have a flaw,"I also bought mine a few years ago and the tank started to leak around the water bib at the bottom. I took it to a repair shop and they gave me a different tank they had repaired (same exact issue the plastic around the bib had gone bad). Seems to me that this is a faw in the manufacturing, as after inspection, the plastic around the bib is a lot thinner than the rest of the tank and thus after a few years of use it gives way and you won't notice until the water starts to rush out of the tank. I now need to buy a new water resevoir at the heafty price of $50! Mind you, it's cheaper then buying a new machine but still, it's deifnately again a manufacturing flaw/issue. Who knows maybe they build them that way to force you to have to buy another tank?? I do love the machine other than this issue, it works really well."
1,WON'T SPRAY,"Bought 2 in the past 3 years. Both stoppeddistributing water after a few carpet cleans.Checked for clogs, etc. Even got online fora quick solution. Couldn't find one. Some sayit's the clean water tank which I checked. Don'tknow. Cleans good when it works, but would notrecommend."
4,Mila Kunis never disappoints!,"Now first off let me say, with the already 'unrated' billing they certainly could have made better use of the lovely Mila Kunis' assets. There are some good scenes with her barefoot on the desert island, the setting for the troubled youth camp which the story revolves around. But in the end she proves a bit too reluctant to show skin, and the movie ends up being more a social commentary piece on the very existence of these camps. Overall a good watch and worthwhile, but if you expect simple cheap titillation you'll be disappointed."
3,Was hoping for a more dramatic escape,"I can't say that boot camp bored me but guess was hoping for a more dramatic escape attempt than was actually done. Maybe with the parents who sent there kids there involved with the escape as well. Nonetheless, was not too bad but probably not good enough to see again. I could be getting tired of watching movies from the Universal HD channel. Some have been ok, some not so good and a few pretty good. Boot camp was ok.Peter J. Miller"
5,Great,This is a great item to purchase. It works well and the color yellow makes it harder to run over with the lawn mower............I also purchased the 50' yellow hose....Love it...
1,ZILCH!,"Don't waste your money. As you probably suspect it's a piece of crap full of empty dialogue in scenes that contribute nothing to the plot (if there was a plot--I was too bored to find it). The women are all retreads with about as much sex appeal as, well, used tires. There is a rape scene at the end--but you're the one who'll be raped. It always amazes me that morons have the ability to scrape up enough money to make such films."
1,Breaks too easily,"I had this item for less than two weeks when it stopped working, and that was only using it 1 - 2 times per week. The cable is too fragile. Do not buy this product."
4,One great record from Philly,This is a great album...there best to date. It is one of my most favorite album's next to Botch-American Nervoso
3,"Very good album, but . . .","I sure wish they had included the original version of ""Devil Went Down to Georgia"". This seems to be a redone version of that song, and though it is good, I really wanted to have the original version. The main reason I bought this album though was for the Orange Blossom Special . . . which does NOT disappoint!!"
3,A Book for young children,"i can see how this book would appeal to young children Its the type that first got me interested in reading fantasy. The reviews here blow the book entirely out of proportion. I can understand how 4th graders would enjoy this book, but people older than that? The characters are naive in addition to being underdeveloped. Every single thing in the plot of this book has been taken from something else. Do you want real fantasy? Try J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman or Piers Anthony. Any one of their books is twenty times better than this one."
5,From Back Cover,"RADIOACTIVE SLAUGHTERHOUSEIt was the ultimate tactical weapon - a small, light weight atomic missile that could be launched from a jeep and pulverize ten square miles of territory.The missile was being developed by a Japanese industrialist for a degenerate Arab terrorist group. If these savages got their hands on the weapon, hundreds of thousands would die in screaming agony.In Tokyo, ISRAELI COMMANDO Dov Abrams had to smash his way through a murderous web of international conspiracy and destroy the missile. If he failed, the terrorists would turn the Middle East into a radioactive slaughterhouse."
4,good enough for the movies...,"My comments are for all three of Sugar's books...as you can imagine they are all full of fast-paced action, yet written very well - so well that they could have been decent screenplays!My only complaint were that the paperbacks were old and had to be handled with care..."
1,This is not worth it.,"I have had this item for amost five months and it has been somewhat good and bad I have sent it back to Lexar and it is going back again soon. If you can aford something else go for it! I feel that I was fooled by the price. my friends have the 128MB size and they say it work for them ,but I am a a high use user. I need something stonger than this. if you are a student try a difften brand."
5,Excellent book for everyone - nutrition made simple!,"I have known Oz for about three years. I started as his patient and am now his friend. He helped me regain my health from a chronic illness. His book is an excellent summary of his practices. You can learn a lot from it - regardless of your age or body type. It is an easy read and his programs are relatively easy to follow. Of course, like any other diet or lifestyle plan, you need some discipline. However, Oz offers an excellent way of life, which is what such a program should be."
3,Not for a beginner,"Fast paced for beginners -- hard to keep up with the exercises. I know I was doing them wrong because I didn't feel the effect she said I would feel. Didn't have time to figure out what was wrong.Some exercises are just awkward. Just wanted some simple exercises -- example: she has you standing up, crossing your legs, then turn your waist while lifting arms.I'm not an exercise instructor -- just someone that wants to tone and loose weight. Make it simple."
5,A good program when you are short on time,This is using different techiques then with her first weight lifting series. She uses the core a lot more in this series which may seem easier but is still a great workout for your body. She gives great cueing through out and this is a great addition to anyone's collection.
2,Not so bouncy and not for TEETHING kids/dogs,"Very dissappointed in this ball... I thought it would bounc a lot higher than it does. I am glad i only bought one... was going to buy a pack of six for my daughter. You deffinitely need adult force to get this ball to bounce, and the material seems that it would come apart if chewed on. Lame Bounce Pinky."
2,This is not a spaldeen high bounce ball,This is not the same type of ball as the spalding high-bounce balls. The spalding High-bounce is a hollow ball much like a racquet ball this ball has a foam rubber core which makes it much heavier. They are charing $3+ for what should be a dollar store buy. I don't recommend it.
1,Stinky Ball,"I can't recommend this ball because it has a strong petrochemical odor that does not go away. The odor gets on your hands as well. I would not let a child use this. I hate to think of the amount of pollution put out by the factory in China to make this silly little ball. The ball is also softer than an old pink ball I keep around the office. And, because it's so soft, it doesn't bounce true. Look around for better pink balls."
1,Not very impressive,"This is a tiny little book, I was not at all impressed with the list of recipes. I think you can find IBD-compatible recipes in most magazines and you can substitute dairy products for non-dairy products. This book is really not worth the price I paid for it."
5,Creative Colitis Cookbook,I really like the recipes. They are recipes that I can use and they also give me a guideline as to what I can and cannot eat.Thank you.
3,Decent.,"To the dude who's crying about why they included Back In Black: Back In Black was included because it was originally put out as a tribute album put out in Bon Scott's honour. Stop moaning about it for god sake.In any event, I semi enjoyed this. But I'm not a big fan of all the live stuff. If you're like me I recommend coming buying the other big box set just released. Has 15 albums I think. It's 300 bucks, but well worth it."
3,smaller than expected,"Targus CityLite Notebook Case, Nylon, 15-3/4w x 4d x 13-3/4h, Black/GrayI received this as a Christmas gift. It does fit my 13"" MacBook Pro in the computer compartment, but can not put my 15"" portable lapdesk with the computer. It will fit in the case, but I have to put it in one of the back compartments. Does not have as much room as most other cases. The laptop compartment measures 13.19"" x 1.69"" x 11.81. They do not tell you this before you can order the item. The exterior dimensions are 15.75"" x 4"" x 13.75"". It is a very sharp looking bag, just wish it was a little bigger."
5,Fantastic and love it as always. The Temps are great,My son gave this Cd to me for Christmas. Great gift for a shagger and listener from Anderson South Carolina. Shagging will always stand
5,Re-verse physcology only works on Democrats,"Obviously, the first 4 reveiws were written by the same person, DA!. Ive never read the book, but i will be getting it soon. Based on my knowledge of complainers, which the previous reveiwer is, this book should be educational. Brad"
3,Sick debut album,"I know alot of people who are against this band because they see them as a diabolic rip off. Well that is because the whole goddamn band (minus kelly from pessimist) was the force behind diabolic's swan song ""vengence ascending"", now knowing that much you know what to expect from these guys, brutal, technical death metal, the sound could use a little work in the guitar department, but other than that i really love this cd the songs are structured correctly, the drummer has some weird odd-time signatures and polyrythms going on which make for an enjoyable lustening experiance, hats off to unholy ghost i'll be looking foward to hearing from them again soon!"
2,Review of DVD Black White & Gray,"I did not care for this DVD for the fact that it was more about Sam Wagstaff's life prior to his relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe rather than a documentary about their time together. To me it touched on their life minimally. Patti Smith added some stories but I already read her view on their life in her book. Disappointed, not what I thought it would be."
3,Kataklysm takes a break from being at the top,"Now don't get me wrong, shadows and dust blew my goddamn mind. But it seems katakylsm simply said ""Hey guys, lets just stick a bunch of double bass and death metal growls into this and call it a day"" and Serenity on Fire was born.At moments it is classic Kataklysm. Sometimes the pace is very intense and heavy. However almost the entire album is just ""satisfactory"" and I leave it at that. It doesn't come near the heaviness of S&D.; For some reason they have a hardcore song on here (Resurrected) and Slither is the most boring death metal song i've ever heard in my life. When first seeing the video, I couldn't believe my ears.What saves this album is the overall skill of the band, especially the drummer. But all I can say is ""satisfactory""."
3,a mi hija de 2.5 anos no la entretuvo,"Tengo una hija de 7 anos que tiene un DS y la hermana de 2.5 anos se lo quita, juega con el y toma fotos, pense que al comrparle esto se acabaria el problema pero no lo puede usar, yo trate de jugar y es algo complicado por que mueves el lapiz en una pantalla y la imagen esta en otra."
3,Pastry mat hard to store,"The pastry mat does the job for cutting out cookies or pastry, but it can't be folded or rolled, so it must be tucked beside the refrigerator or oven, where I think it is going to collect that grime that appliances tend to give off. If you have a good storage spot, it will be a good purchase."
5,Hard to beat,"Got these in and spent 3 solid days bushwhacking through creeks, boulders, and briars. Flawless for what I just used them for. As I've only had them out for one trip, I can't really comment on their longevity, except to say that they are no worse for the wear thus far."
5,Show your love of the GSD breed,A friend gave me a pair of these socks. I love them so much that I am looking to buy some to give as gifts to friends in the German Shepherd Dog community.
1,Figure broke first day,"The action figure broke the first day that my son played with it. We purchase a lot of action figures and rarely does one break. I was appalled that the toy would break the first day he played with it. We have had the same problem with other Mortal Kombat action figures. We have figures that we have had for years, but we have had a total of 4 Mortal Kombat figures break within weeks of having them."
3,Surprisingly Bland,"This teaching book contains all of the standard beginner information, and may be fine for those just starting, especially children. However, the entire presentation of the book is bland; from the plain 2 color presentation, to the seeminly uninspired presentation of information.In other words, it offers little towards offering the extras that keep a self teaching student motivated and wanting to turn to the next page.I'm sure this book will teach you to play violin, but it certainly doesn't seem to be worthy of a 5 star rating. At least it wasn't that expensive, and does come with a CD, which is good."
3,"Good book, Writen more for student teacher relation ship","This is a pretty good learning book, although it is more of a student teacher relationship rather than a student book relationship. Not one of the best books I've used but definitely not bad."
3,just as needed,this is the same as my daughter uses in school. just wanted one at home in case she wanted to practice
4,Cleats for the grandson,"The cleats were purchased for a grandson. Very nice looking, but the size ran small so had to pass them along to a younger grandson. Value was good."
5,Grandma Kay,Great book Debbie Macomber is an awesome author......You can't go wrong with any of her books. I would highly recommend this book.
2,"OK, not great","I did only order with standard shpping, but it took 2 1/2 weeks to receive product.- Uncomfortable in ear- Quality of sound not great- Great pricebought for my Samsung Wafer, product works, I wasn't impressed with the quality which suprised me because Samsung usually is pretty good, but can't complain too much for the price."
3,Serves the purpose but with some flaws,"I ordered this to help keep from killing people (including myself) while driving and talking on the phone. I avoided Bluetooth because I want to keep it in my car without a) having to charge it and b) risking some jerk smashing my window to steal my headset.Anyhooo....there are a few problems with the design. I don't like the length of the earbud cords...too long for the earbud that's not close to the microphone. Also, the way the connector bends up relative to the phone making it hard to adjust the volume (the connector gets too close to the buttons).But with these flaws, they work okay. You can hear well and be heard well enough, and the buds are cheap if you find the right vendor (yay Amazon!)."
2,Locking Raised Toilet Seat -,"This product was priced well, shipped on a timely basis. The height was good - a 1/2 inch taller than others I found.However, for a woman, I found the shape to be less than perfect - the front being too wide. With a hip replacement, it was difficult to sit at all - and the size of the opening was just too samll in the front."
1,Don't waste your time,I bought this to connect my MP3 player to my car. It worked for about a week. After that I could only get it to work if I held it just right. I ended up throwing it away after two weeks. Don't waste your money.
1,Very Disappointing,"I love the French culture and thought a book about Americans living in France would be amusing. I was wrong. This book is poorly written, and honestly is painful to read. I read it only because I bought it, and I feel compelled to read things I spend my money on. But yes, this one will be sold to the used book store with a good riddance. I didn't like any of the characters, the plot never really developed, and there was no resolution. Save your money for something better."
3,An Interesting Read!,This is the second book that I've read by Ms. Johnson and I find her form of writing to be at times witty and then at times to be very confusing and well...dry. For the most part I did enjoy this read. She has great imagination when it comes to her character's as well as her storylines. I almost felt as if I had stepped into a soap opera. For a light read you can't go wrong with this author.
1,Like hitting little bricks,"They look perfect, but whatever they coat them with makes them feel very heavy, like TopFlites. Save for hitting over the water or other hazards."
3,Convenience vs. damaged discs,"We have owned 2 of the earlier generations of this machine and both began to eat cds after a year or more. When we considered that the machine operates on ""shuffle"" mode all day, every day (about 3500 hours a year) it seemed reasonable to expect it to wear out. We enjoy the convenience of not having to handle and put away discs so much that we are willing to toss the worn-out machine and buy a new one. The likelihood of the discs being damaged by handling them/dropping them/having the cat sit on them is as great as the eventual damage they will receive when the machine finally starts eating discs.The new feature of being able to program the machine to not play songs we don't like is something we'd wished for. I'll get No. 3."
4,Beautiful Artwork,"After reading The Time Traveler's Wife,I had to buy this.I really enjoyed the book. The artwork is beautiful and strange. The story itself is a little disturbing and sparse. Regardless of that, I really enjoyed reading it. I have flipped thru it three times and everytime I find something that I missed before. The book is nice and big, not what I expected at all. Even if you do not like the story the artwork alone is worth buying the book for. All in all, to me it was a great purchase."
4,Fever Tree - 'Fever Tree / Another Time Another Place' (See For Miles),"Good 2-lp's on one CD. I vaguely remember the name Fever Tree, a Houston psychedelic band that released several albums during their 1966-1970 existence. This import has the band's first self-titled lp and their second effort 'Another Time Another Place' - both released in 1968. Tunes here I enjoyed the most were their nifty Beatles cover ""Day Tripper / We Can Work It Out"", the moody ""Filligree And Shadow"", ""Imitation Situation"" {sort of reminds me of the Guess Who""}, the kick-*ss ""Man Who Paints The Pictures"" and their best known song ""San Francisco Girls"". Might obviously do a lot for fans of Bubble Puppy, Blues Magoos, Music Machine, Chocolate Watchband, Demian and possibly Love."
5,Fever Tree/Another Time Another Placw,It gives you a sense of 1960's without the drugs. All tracks very different then the others. I highly recommend this cd.
5,Excellent textbook in low price!,"New seller seems to be better than before. :)Shipping was made in time, and the book was in perfect condition.What can you expect more?"
4,alarmingly good,"This won't be a long review. It's simply written to recommend a very good read. The people and language feel real (apart from a few small moments but that's possibly because these events are so foreign to my nature). The voice of Jasira is warm and she's somebody you feel the need to protect. Both of the parents are cold and distant while the neighbours are both good and bad.I will now have to re-read 'the da vinci code'(for studies) and am grateful to have read Towelhead, a 'real' book, before getting bogged down in the heavy handed and overly formulaic rubbish that Dan Brown saw fit to have published.It feels like i'm leaving Melina's house and journeying into the darkness of the Vuoso's. i hope i don't let his cat out!"
5,Life Isn't Always Pretty,"Wow--TOWELHEAD's reviews on here have been pretty disparate, to say the least. I guess that's why I have to throw in my .02 and say that this book ROCKED! Alicia Erian is an extremely gifted writer who has a lot of courage for tackling taboo after taboo subject in such an engaging, readable way. I'm proud of her and her publisher for not shying away from the twisted sickness that can sometimes be our world. I loved how Erian consistently and believably wrote Jasira's story from a 13-year-old's point of view. Her narrative dug deep, serving to pace the novel exquisitely. If you enjoyed the poignancy evoked in Jennifer Lauck's memoir BLACKBIRD, then TOWELHEAD is for you. Just don't be surprised if you stay up all night reading."
3,Decent Western,"First, I watched the instant video here and there are no problems with picture quality like some people are saying about the DVD. It's a great print and the film is beautifully shot. I'll let others deal with the accuracy of the story. It's true there is quite a bit that does not jibe with the true events. However as just entertainment this is a fun western and native Americans are for the most part given given their due and they are not ""disrespected."" Quite a bit of location shooting and the widescreen lens really do justice to the scenery."
1,Poor Quality Product,Absolutely the poorest quality video of any product that I have ever purchased. I have downloaded video files from Internet Archive that are 100% better than this product. I would not award this item with one star if I could have selected none. It appears like the product was produced using various individuals who did not have the same ability. On one occasion Custers hair is red and then later it is blond like it should be. Best guess is it was actually produced outside the US. This product is not copy protected but I can't imagine anyone would want to copy it. Unfortunately the story line is probably correct.
3,Sitting Bull,"Fictional, haphazard account, poorly plotted, but with enough character interest to keep it alive, throughout the many horse chases. Scenery not up to par. Otherwise, time consuming and with the typical Custer finale ...CRH"
2,SIMPLE PREDICTABLE PLOT,"The best thing about this book was the reader. She did a very good job with all the voices of the the different characters. If you're in to all church and religious themes you may enjoy. I'm not, but I finished it anyway."
4,Dated but still good,"The only volume this far covering British Battle Dress in its many forms from 1937 to the 1970s. Carter Rila doesn't mention that it also inspired the German Felduniform 1944. Not sure why he goes on at length about the history of BD; many of his details are wrong. Pick up the book and you'll like it - a fast guide to BD and its various variants, and so far, the only game in town for that. For wartime BD see also Brian L. Davis' BRITISH ARMY UNIFORMS AND INSIGNIA OF WORLD WAR TWO, THE BRITISH SOLDIER and THE CANADIAN SOLDIER by Jean Bouchery, TOMMY by Gordon, the other TOMMY with color photos, and DRESSED TO KILL."
5,Awesome book,"If you really want to understand how a pro thinks Phil Gordon is ""The Guy"" to read. He walks you thru his thought process, whether he was right or wrong, and shows you how he makes his decisions. He is entertaining and tries to explain in simple terms a game that can be complex to master. He is by far the best author I have read. He provides practical information from his real-life poker experiences. All of this culminates into a great book."
4,Great Music!,"Great french music for you french children!! So catchy, the whole family will be singins these songs!!"
5,Perfect piano with a Hawaiian flavour,"Back in 1963, I first heard the song ""Here is Happiness"" when an album, brought back from Hawaii, was being played. All attempts to get a copy of that album failed. This new album does contain the long sought tune. The other cuts are different from the record I first heard, but none the less enjoyable.Soft, easy listening for a romantic dinner party, or just enjoyable background music. Well worth trying."
1,this is more analysis and not the story,"I wanted to know the story of Susan Smith. I wanted to know what she was thinking when she killed her kids...I wanted to know what led up to the point where she pulled the break and let the car go into the lake. This book does not tell the story....It analyzes the questions that everyone has. I was so upset reading the book, but thought it had to get good at some point...nope, no such luck...all the way to the end of the book the author brings a question to the forthought and then explains why that might or might not be the reason....if i wanted analysis, i would be looking at research papers...never expected to see research papers joined together to make a book...."
4,"Love the top, not so much for the bottoms","For my body, the top fit great while the bottom was nearly a size too big. I'm built with broader shoulders, and more narrow hips; so I tend to do better with suits purchased as separates. For the price, I can't complain as I have a pair of tan/brown bottoms that coordinate with the colors in the top. Not to mention it would cost as much, or more, for just a top at most stores.The top is very cute, subdued colors and a shelf type bra with wire support. The material feels as if it would get picks in it fairly easy. I have not worn it to the pool yet so I can't speak to it's feel or durability in the water. The bottoms are typical spandex; seem to be well made although I can't make use of them myself."
5,Great Meditations,"Very good and inspiring. You can pick it up and read one page, or sit down and read it all."
2,"Not annoying, but a total waste of time.","I was very glad I had something else to do while this was on the screen, as it would have been very trying to sit through it. The acting is good, but the movie is so slow-moving and repetitious that it could be edited way down and still not be very interesting.The Indians had really nifty costumes, though. And John Huston had a unique hat. That is about it for the whole movie."
2,horn bulb,"The bulb didn't even last a year as it cracked and was dried out. I guess we need to strive to do ""made in America""."
2,Kinda cheap,"Hard to believe these are real Rockports. Was the price a giveaway?nless you wont be walking mucvh in these they are much too thin with no enough support. No padding, just the one layer of shoe upper! Not reccommended for those who plan to actually walk."
5,Pro Recessed Flip Handle,"You will flip once you experience the quality of this low priced recessed handle! Solidly built indeed. We are in the recording business and have to hall around very costly recording gear. So when you don't want to worry about a custom case that's carrying thousands of dollars worth of audio equipment, you have to turn to a high-end design of hardware. This is it...big bang for the bucks!"
4,My husband really liked the product. It lathered ...,My husband really liked the product. It lathered well and the scent was great. I was very surprised when I opened the box and found a huge bottle. The product goes a long way so I think this will last quite a while.
2,"Irrespective of contents, physical properties cheaply done","I was very unhappy when I saw the cheap quality of The Big Basics Web Directory published by Que.. The paper is the kind used for coloring books, and the printing is poorly done. In some instances it is all but impossible to read the black print on dark gray background. I had expected to receive a book of at least as good quality as Que's Complete Idiot's Guide to Windows 95. Sorry about this poor review. This is the first time in a long time I've been so disappointed in a book I had ordered sight unseen."
1,Inaccurate size,This bra is not as described. The 36B that I ordered was a full 2 inches shorter in the chest band than the other bras of the same size that I own. There is no way this could serve functionally as a nursing bra. The fabric on the cups did not even begin to cover the breast area. When I opened the package I had to laugh because they looked just like little girls' training bras. Do not waste your money! I immediately sent them back for a refund.
4,Very FUN game! Needs some work...,"I read a few of the bad reviews and gave the game a chance anyway. When I got it out and put it together I found out the game board comes in two peices, the small peice was a little warped, but didn't affect the game play. We played it a few times one day and it worked great. The next day we got it out to play and when captin bones jumped out of the box he would miss the tokens on top of your game peice and he would get stuck on the treasure chest when going back down into it. I thought GREAT, should have listend to the reviews. Called the company, they offered to take the game back and give us a new game, but I couldn't get the game I was returning....ridiculous! Anyway, I played around with captain bones and relized part of his body had popped apart, snapped the peices back together and he has worked every since. Very fun game! Just beware he may pop apart."
1,fun when it works,"My kids loved this game, but it did not last. If the game did not break down I would give this game 5 stars. The problem is that Captain Bones stopped working after two or three games. The game was a blast and lots of fun at first. If they fix the problem I would definatly give it 5 stars. Too bad it broke down after such a short time."
2,sex + tragic = art,"What is erotic? What is tragic? Is there a difference? There are so many films that focus on sex and the seemingly inevitable disastrous outcome of having it that its remarkable anyone has anything else to say on the subject. Nonzee Nimibutr's film explores a multi-layered onion of sex, family, and above all, dysfunction. As with most foreign films, the tone is heavy and the sex seems even more seedy, depressing, and ultimately pathetic.This might be precisely the point Nimibutr wants to make with Jan Dara, but it is difficult to give much back as a viewer. Our main character is seen growing from child to man, played by different actors and therefore, we lose our connection with him. Ultimately, its simply sad and I kept waiting for it to end."
4,colorful fun pop-up dinosaur poems,"This colorful book features six pop-up dinosaurs accompanied by short nonsense rhymes. Readers lift the flap of each two-page spread to reveal a brightly colored dinosaur and a goofy poem. the final pop-up contains all six dinosaurs and the words ""Flapdoodle dinosaurs say Good night, sleep tight, we'll see you again tomorrow night""Fun introduction to poetry and dinosaurs for the littlest readers."
4,Great Dance Music!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this CD. All pieces are performed at 54 measures per minute; playing time is between 2 and 2.5 minutes on average, the longest being 3 mins 19 secs. A few pieces have very brief introductory measures. The orchestration is also pleasant to listen to. The only reason I did not give this album 5 stars is that I have heard more sophisticated orchestrations [but at least 5 times the price]."
3,An interesting if sad look back,"I agree with the reviewer who said that the Hamptons were ruined long ago -- by the very succession of waves of development that this book touts. I do love looking at some of the quality design of the past that this book shows, but the new reality is overbuilding and, even worse, tasteless building. The feeling of getting away to a charming, easy-going, and low-key place with rural roots is gone forever in the Hamptons. We left because of the continuing intrusion of the nouveau riche who are more interested in showing off than in quietly relaxing-----peoplewho have now made the Hamptons a decidedly UNCOOL place to be."
3,"Kids enjoyed this toy, BUT...","it had to be repaired after one day of use. The seam of the cushion popped open, which considering it is only glued under the seam was inevitable. Used a little packing tape and all fixed, but seriously why should I have to use packing tape."
5,amazing,"after listening to this i realized that ektomorf is better than soulfly .their lyrics are the best from what i have listened to.the songs 'destroy','you are my shelter' and 'i know them' r just perfect"
2,did someone say soulfly?,"I bought this album with the impression it was a technical death metal album...unfortunately it is quite the opposite. This album has the nu-metal sound, but pretty harsh, and a bit more musical than most albums of the genre. There are some decent riffs, some interesting chants and the incorporation of some exotic instruments to break up the songs a little, perhaps add variety. But when I finish listening, I can't really remember anything that memorable. I think you'll like this if you are a Soulfly fan, which I am not, but if you are this may be worth your time. If you are like me and prefer the heavier side of things, this probably isn't your best choice... it gets 2 stars for effort, the chants, and reaching the level of musicianship past the usual nu-metal trash."
3,NOT BETTER THAN SOULFLY !!!!!!!!,Ektomorf is a good band and they can be easly confused with soulfy to the untrained ear but in no way shape or form do they hold a candle to soulfy. As far as im concerned ektomorf is just a johnny come lately band. Max cavalera has been playing this type of music since he was with sepultura in the 80's. so when ektomorf gets a decade under their belt then they might have a chance. all in all if you mix the soulfly tribal sound with hatebreed vocals and and instruments you will get ektomorf
4,Short but sweet !!,"A nice compilation of Chess sides for a great price. Muddy didn't put out any bad songs during this time period, and the fact that this recording contains a number of songs not featured on many other complations proves that. ""Born lover"" and ""mad love"" are lesser known songs but they stand up well next to the better known ""hootchie coochie man"". Great bargain!!"
4,good resource,"Used this product when studing Ancient Egypt with my homeschooled 1st grader. He like the activities, and many were educational (not just busy work/or arts)"
1,3 times Junk,"This item gets 1 star only because I had to, it deserves a 0 star. Bought a 3.5mm Stereo Jack To 1/4"" Stereo Plug Adapter from LowerPriceUSA... product was defective (will not accept the 3.5 plug) and replaced by LowerPriceUSA with a second defective product. If I have #2 replaced, will #3 be any different then #1 and #2?... most likely not. Save your money."
1,Horrible,Honestly this is the cheapest jack I've ever purchased. Do not get this. Right now I have to wiggle it around just to get a clear signal. It is horrible.
4,4 1/2 stars - disturbing but compelling,"With Turning Angel, Iles again spins a compelling story around topics that some would rather ignore -relationships between adults and minors, teenage drug use, recreational sex, and even a hint of racism. While perhaps not as disturbing as the issue of sexual abuse of children presented in his previous work, Blood Memory, this nonetheless is a bit like a bad car accident - you don't want to look but at the same time you can't turn away. Iles keeps the reader locked in even when he would possibly rather look away. In this story, Iles goes back to the character set from The Quiet Game. Character development lets the reader understand the egos, anxieties, and motivations of a broad set of characters -- and also drives the reader to form an affinity or antipathy for most characters. The intensity and buildup of the story, combined with the nature of the subject matter make this a very emotional read - especially for a parent of teenagers or soon-to-be teenager"
4,Another Great One For Iles,"Despite what some of the other reviewers said, I really liked this book. It was another page turner for me. When I want to read instead of doing anything else, then I know it is a good book! I have read all of Greg Iles books and this one is another winner. I am an ardent fan and will continue to read everything that he writes. I think anyone who reads this book will enjoy it."
3,Greg Iles Never Disappoints!,"Unlike some popular authors who have several successful books and then seem to churn out books just to take advantage of their name, Greg Iles never disappoints this reader. Penn Cage returns in this story. Now an author, he helps a friend accused of murder, and digs into the seedy, criminal side of Natchez, Mississippi. A very satisfying read!Although Turning Angel features a returning protagonist, Mr. Iles doesn't write predictably: his books have a vast and differing variety of plots, and I always look forward to a new read."
3,Iles Can Do Much Much Better,"Greg Iles usually writes very good books. This one, sad to say, doesn't qualify for that description. Aside from the fact that it is just plain ponderous to read, the plot is bizarre, the characters are so stereotypical you would have thought it was the authors first novel and finally, the books story line is just so implausible as to be unbelievable, and thus not very entertaining. Three stars are probably being generous. I borrowed the book from the library. So should you."
4,"Great book, BUT...","I agree with most of what others have said in their reviews; this book is difficult to put down, has a great, brisk pace, and it will keep you guessing. But, the only problem I had was reading the excerpts from Kate's diary and the dialogue between Penn and his teenage babysitter, Mia. I had a hard time believing that teenagers really write and speak the way they do in Turning Angel. ESPECIALLY, the sexual content. It kind of reminded me of the bad pornography out there i.e. what a male wishes a woman would want and not what a woman really finds erotic. At the end of the book he thanks some teenagers for helping him by giving their perspective so who knows, this could be real stuff (scarey thought). Otherwise, it is an excellent read as are ALL of his books. Greg Iles is always a sure bet!"
4,"A good thriller, if not a great one","I'm not sure I understand the uproar voiced in some of these reviews. This book is not exactly as controversial as, for example, Lolita.I am amazed that some people are shocked by the relationships portrayed, which must be as old as humanity itself. Men have always been attracted to young women (not children, as some suggest below), and some occasionally succumb to that temptation, and this is not news, folks. I applaud Iles for having the courage to portray fairly the conflicting feelings and values involved without necessarily condoning the apparent moral lapse of the accused killer.Where the book is more problematic is in the plot itself, which is pretty incredible in many respects. But it is an engaging enough book with realistic characters, and worth reading of a nice summer weekend. Not Iles's best, but a fun and engaging read."
2,doesn't make me happy,"I liked Beverley so much when she did soulmusic. All her albums were great, wonderful songs, a fabulous voice....and now she does this strange rock record. Not my cup of tea :("
1,Bloody Awful,"There's no way to keep the string from fouling between the reel and the so-called brake-- which does not seem to slow or stop the reel--short of watching it like a hawk. I want to be able to look up at my kite while I'm reeling it in, not have to watch the string to make sure it goes on the reel. I suppose I could slide the string over my finger, if I want a nice friction burn on my finger when I'm letting the string out.My six-year old has trouble holding it, as it wants to slip out of her hand (frankly, it wants to slip out of *my* hand in any kind of stiffish breeze).It's also pretty flimsy-feeling in my hand. Can't recommend this for anything other than the spiffy color scheme (mine has bright orange and green parts, along with the day-glo yellow shown), which is not enough to make it worth the money. You're probably better off getting a fishing reel."
5,Gets to the Heart,"Gets to the HeartI have read the whole series of books by David Pelzer, each is better than the last. I recommend these books to everyone I know whether they have been abused or not as they lend insight, courage and determination sometimes in the face where none exist. Again, This newest books shows the depth that david Pelzer is.Also recommended: Nightmares Echo, All David Pelzer Books, Running With Scissors"
1,Death of frachise,The gundam series used to a very deep action action series that was never a kiddy series. This is completlety different. It is a paper thin story with bland charecters nad stupid villain. sd gundam is just kiddy seires like pokemon with know real depth what so ever. Stupid kids under 7 may like. any besides that should stay far far away.
2,Poor CD Sound Quality,"This CD-Set was not up to snuff on sound quality. I expected a CD released in 2000 to sound much better. This set sounds like a studio rehearsal (no liner notes or any information is included). Peter Tosh provides lead vocals on several songs. I would not recommend this set, and instead would advise the $50 set (Songs of Freedom). If you seek only a single CD, buy Legend--the Best of Bob Marley. Other excellent CDs include Exodus, Kaya, Uprising, Catch a Fire, and the live CD's Babylon By Bus, and Live."
4,good,"They are kind of hard to work with because they are soooooooo thin, but for the price, not bad at all."
4,hot new song,"I'm not sure if this song is truely new but I heard it on the radio and I love it. If you like Angelina, then you'll like Adrianaa. They sort of have the same kind of style. I like the beats of this song the most. Its worth buying this CD."
5,Love it!!! Fast service too,"This is a must have for me. Spritz before moisturizer and moisture works better. Spray over make up to set it, tone and moisturize your skin. If you haven't tried it, you have to.. you'll love it.. and in this hot weather. ahhh love it !!! Thank you for excellent prompt shipping and product exactly as advertised .. good seller, good transaction !!"
3,review,"this product is refreshing for hot summer days or for whenever you need to wake up and have a fresh feeling face after a long day at the office. Although, I did not see any noticeably great improvements in the condition of my skin"
1,Schenker Loses touch with reality,"This album is by far the absolute worst release EVER from the ""Mad Axeman"" Leif Sundin's vocals are flat and boring and Schenker's songwriting is a complete disaster on this release. There are no ""standout"" tracks at all. I've had this album since it's original release and I think it's a waste of space but if you are into collecting cd's by Schenker as I am you will want this just to have your collection complete but it's not even worth my time to take it out of the case and put it into my cd player. I have better albums to listen to. Hell, I'll even put in a Britney Spears cd before this junk and that's saying quite alot!"
4,SUSPENSE-PACKED,"this book is very exciting,and action packed.the suspense in it never stops,as you follow alice's adventure running,running away from the world,and doing the craziest things.you'll always want to know what she's going to do next,and how she gets out of jams of being recognized,or caught.the story is all only for about a day,but they show all details."
3,'Not sure about the hidden messages the book delivers,"This was one of those books chosen by others for me to read with my students. Cooney is very popular with the pre-teen/teen set and thus comes highly recommended. Several of the kids that I teach had read other titles; so, I was positive that this would be a rewarding experience for us all.Well, the kids liked it, intently anticipating each development as it unfolded, and were satisfied by the ""revelation"" at the end. I suppose, then, the book is a success.My major concern, however, is how Cooney's protagonist ""Alice"" reacts to certain situations. Without revealing any of the plotlines, I can say that Alice's actions involve deception, thievery, mistrust of the police, and contempt. She also made some genuinely dumb choices.The young impressionable mind might assume that in order to survive, these are worthy attributes to have.I made sure that my kids knew otherwise."
3,book review on Wanted,"In the book Wanted by Caroline B. Cooney, is about a girl name Alice was accused of killing her father. It all started when Alice got a phone call from her father. Her fathers told her to get two disks labeled twin and drive to the ice-cream shack. While waiting for her father to come, she finds out her father was killed and they say Alice was the killer. In the book Alice goes all over to find who killed her father. I think this book is great. I would suggest this book to people who like thinking to find out who killed someone."
4,Martha is a classy lady!!,"This was my first Motown book and I am glad to say that. I enjoyed Dancing in the Streets more than I did Mary Wilson's books. Now we all know that all of the spurned Motown artist feel burned and are out to get what's owed them, but in reading this book, I did not feel like that was the driving force behind its conception. Martha tells it like it is! I commend her for this effort! I hope she writes another one!!I highly recommend this one!"
1,Use less battery..better off buying a used Samsung battery,"This battery only worked for few weeks, but after that it couldn't even hold charge for a day.You are better off buy the 1200mAh version. I had luck for 6 months, not bad, but it could have been better. I just dont want to replace my A900 phone, but i may have to."
3,Never Tease Me,"I loved and treasured this book ever since my baby sister was born in 1969. I have the classic edition but didn't want my kids to tear it up so I was over-joyed to see it back in print. I give it a ""thumbs up "" for being reprinted and the words being the same. But honestly, I really don't like the new illustrations. The simple pictures were part of the joy of the classic edition. These seem so busy that the kids really don't pay them much mind. They are colorful, I will grant them that but it is a simple story with a simple message wearing ""fancy-pants"" pictures."
3,Not Thrilled with the New Illustrations,"I loved this book as a child, and was so excited to see it in print again. Although the rhyming story is still absolutely wonderful, the new illustrations are a terrible fit for the tale. The old illustrations were really beautiful, with an adorable little girl doing the weasel teasing. Kids could imagine themselves as that child and learn the lesson about being kind to animals. The new illustrations feature bully-type children doing the teasing, and I don't think very many kids will make the connection between the characters and themselves. Too bad this book wasn't reprinted with the original, delightful artwork. I'm going to start looking around for the old version."
5,Never Tease A Weasel,I have one of the original prints of this book and have made it a point to read it to every new child born into this family. I have a bookplate on the inside and I record each childs name and date. I wouldn't trade my copy for anything!!!
1,Worthless,"The speakers are full of static and intermittant even when close to the transmitter, rendering them worthless. Also, they require 16 batteries, which is not disclosed. One could buy 2 expensive a/C adapters, but then you may as well use wired speakers."
5,Transformational Coaching with the Enneagram,"In his book, Masterful Coaching, Robert Hargrove distinguishes between ""incremental learning"" (single-loop), ""reframing"" (double-loop learning), and ""transformational learning"" (triple-loop). These distinctions (based on the original work of Gregory Bateson, and extended by Chris Argyris and Peter Senge) are important in business settings. Most development work with executives takes place at the incremental level (helping them to embody new skills and capabilities), sometimes at the level of reframing (challenging them to reshape their patterns of thinking), but seldom at the transformational level (creating a shift in context or point of view about themselves). The author gives solid case examples. You'll find it a fascinating read."
1,Poorly written junk,"This book might be useful as the basis for a game where players get points for finding misspellings and typos (Look Inside the Introduction to play for yourself). As a technical reference, it looks useless."
5,They got their own sound,"Well what can i say, if you're somewhere between 45 and 55 you'll love them. There sound are almost unik. When i say almost, i mean it this way. Take "" Middle of the road "" throw five pounds more rock into it, and the result will be "" Shocking blue "". The only difference between them was, Shocking blue wrote all their music themselves, and they did it wery vell. But listen to it, and you will love them too."
5,great!,"incredible voice (mariska veres), and songs, composed by robbie van leeuwen, u must listen this unknown dutch group from late 60's and early 70's. Alaska country, i love woodo music, and the incredible, great, dark daemon Lover, are just a part of incredible songs.if u want more of the best shocking blue, just take at home, and third album"
1,Avoid this terrible cabinet rack,"Here's what you get - a plastic rack and two screws. No instructions, nothing. There are no holes for the screws - there are small slots they sort of fit in. The screws were far too small to support this cabinet under my sink. Basically you get a $6 piece of plastic that isn't supported. It's completely useless. Save yourself some frustration and avoid it."
4,Interesting Wittgenstein scrapbook,"If you've read Monk's biography, this is a useful addition to understanding Wittgenstien and his motivations/working style.It is hard to imagine getting much from the book if you don't know of Wittgenstein, it is not introductionBut if you're familiar with him (use reading (or wanting to read) the Monk book as a useful indicator) -- it's a joy."
5,Dilbert will forever be remembered.,"Dilbert is a cultural icon. Possibly too good for it's time. The jokes in Dilbert are amazingly smart, and I don't think deserves to be in the comic pages by idiocy. Anyway, this book marks the first (and possibly the best) comics from the Dilbert series. Characters we're still developing and the niche of the comic was still undecided. Regardless, it's a gut bustingly funny collection.If you even have the tiniest, remote sense of humor, buy this. And when your done, by the funniest tv-show ever made; no, not seinfeld. Dilbert: the complete series. If not, go back to your pathetically boring life and dirty cubicle.Scott Adams remains one of the funniest authors in the world."
3,It's OK,"The footage is mostly clips of newsreels with a very amateurish, almost innocuous sounding man speaking a voice over. The voice over does not just translate the English subtitles into English (Yes I thought that rather odd), but sounds very silly trying to out shout clips from ""Triumph of the Will."" I will not buy any more of this series, due to its mediocrity."
4,An Hidden Gem,"Came across Savant `The Neo-Realist' in a Tobias Freund podcast and really liked it so did some digging and found the CD available on amazon. The comparisons to My Life in the Bush... are justified, but hey another hour of fourth world music, bring it on."
1,This book is Satanism teaching!!,"This book is very very dangerous, it is Jesuit-Satanism teaching.It is occultism and spirit-ism blending with the protestant world.It is one of tools from the catholic church to destroy the protestant church.Be away from it!!See:[...]Or enter:[...]rekindling the reformation"
2,Homophobic!,"How disappointing - I had so looked forward to readingthis book, but after this paragraph, I just couldn't takethe author serious anymore. Good thing I hadn't wastedmuch time, the quote occurs fairly early in the book.I guess I'm going to sell it on [INTERNET SITE] to get at least someof my money back."
5,Discipline for living,I recommend this book to everyone as it puts into focus those disciplines that help us face each day and overcome the stress and uncertainties that life places before us.
5,Change your perspective of the spiritual disciplines,"I originally read this book as required reading for a course in spiritual disciplines. It has literally changed my intimate life with Jesus Christ. It is a refreshing journey back to the disciplines that foster intimate, vibrant Christian faith. This book will help you grow closer to Christ."
3,pretty good,I didn't need the patterns for all the furniture etc that go with the clothing. I would have preferred more clothing patterns. Actual pattern pieces are included and can be interspersed to improvise. Easy to read instructions.
2,Good idea...but not practical,"I registered for this item with my first child thinking it would be so great to have him sleep in bed with us his first couple months...not to mention easier to breast feed at night. But if you have anything other than a king size bed...don't buy this product. We have a queen size and there was absolutely no room for my husband and I to move around in after this was in bed with us. Plus, my son grew so quickly that he outgrew this thing 3 weeks after he was born. It was a nice idea...but not very practical for parents who weren't getting much sleep anyway."
2,Not useful for some babies,"My advice - keep the box and receipt. We decided we wanted to co-sleep before my first son was born. This seemed like the safest solution. He hated it!!! The first two nights we tried it, he absolutely cried when we laid him in it. The mattress is hard, and I have to imagine it doesn't smell anything like mom, so he was very unhappy. He also hated his bassinet. He slept next to me for the first 10 months of his life - then moved to a crib in our room for the next 8 months. My only point is that some kids need closer contact with mom than this allowed. I'm now expecting my 2nd and looking at co-sleepers, but won't throw out the box or receipt."
4,buy this!!!,"i purchased this b/c i wanted my son to be close enough that i could check him whenever i wanted, which is a lot when they're newborns. I also thought i'd rest better in between feedings every 2-3 hours knowing that we wouldn't roll or smother him. they didn't have this product when my first was in our bed and having it with our second made both myself and my husband rest better. we too have a king size bed and it did take up a lot of the room (my husband couldn't even roll) but for what little sleep we got in the beginning, neither of us minded!!"
3,Little Kitties Will Like It.,"My cats loved this product when we sprinkle catnip on it. What at an resist catnip? However after having to sweep up catnip a couple times because the cats tipped it over we decided that it wasn't a keeper for our house. If you are looking for a scratcher for a full grown cat, look elsewhere."
1,Warranty Nice on Paper/Worthless in reality,"JBL state have long warranty, just try to get one of these speakers fixed. Can get ahold people, wont return calls. Take it to authorized repair center, tell you JBL takes MONTHS to get replacement part. Just try contact JBL, GOOD LUCK!!! Last time I spend money on ANY JBL product"
4,A delightful book.,"Hicks has written a particularly engaging character in Toby. I also appreciated his making the celebrity couple real, grounded people. There was interesting legal information which didn't bog down the story, and some good twists along the way. But it was Toby's relationship with his grandfather was particularly touching. The book is a bit mystery light, but is an entertaining first book and a series I shall definitely follow."
5,A new OPI favorite!,"I LOVE THIS COLOR! It is a really nice bronze shade, and is dark enough that it doesn't look like a tacky gold color. It is perfect for fall. Like all OPI polishes the wide brush and perfect formula make aplication easy and flawless!"
2,Forget wholesalers,"Forget wholesalers like Costco. Just saw this at a grocery store chain called Safeway for $19.99 for a 12 pack. That is still cheaper than Amazon. Reading the reviews, the price on this product fluctuates a LOT."
2,Cans leaked before expiration date,"I bought this item several months ago and stored it in a cool, dry place. When I went to get some cans today, 7 of the 12 remaining cans had leaked at least half their contents, leaving behind a moldy mess. I also had to toss several other food items that I had stored next to the red bull because they were also covered in mold. The cans are still more than two months from their expiration date. I'm very disappointed and now I don't feel comfortable drinking the remaining five cans in case there was some kind of defect with the entire batch."
5,Amazon just make life much easier!,"It was so easy go online and couple of clicks and there you go job done well! It was so easy to order redbull online with amazon and with its free shipping makes things much easier, no need to go to grocery store and pay more and then carry it all the way home. Here just few clicks and in couple of days it comes right at your door step. I would really recommend to all redbull lovers to order from amazon."
1,Not what I thought!!,"With thie toy being described as giant, I expected it to be bigger then it was. It is only about 4 inches in lenght. and it is very thin. I have other products from this compant, like the flesh eating disease. And I expected to to be a little more like that one. Much fuller in size , more stuffed animal like."
3,An interesting failure,"Three-quarters of a very good, sly novel about the vanity and shallowness of the yuppie lifestyle, marred by an unconvincing thriller plot in the final 1/4. Kennedy should really try his hand at a straight novel -- I don't think even he really believes in the thriller aspects of The Job."
4,3 1/2 DAYS !,"....thats how long it took me to finish this one ! A bit Grisham'ish, but being involved in sales, i could really feel what was going on. A bit predictable towards the end, but still a great read !!"
4,a great beach read,"I enjoyed The Big Picture, and I thought his next effort was even better.....extremely suspenseful...reminded me more of Daniel Balducci's stuff....worth a look!!"
2,Kennedy touches all the bases,"As a thriller, this book is certainly serviceable, albeit formulaic. Kennedy knows how to set up a scenario. Halfway through the book, I found myself empathizing with Ned. But the pacing of the last half of the book was off, as if Kennedy got tired of his own story."
3,"Just like ""The Firm"".Great devt, pageturner, poor ending","The Job had very interesting characters, some clever plot twists, but, just like The Firm, the ending was hastily put together and did not fit with the tone and buildup. Also, Kennedy could have found another ""crime"" to center the thriller around, other than off-shore money laundering and having the protagonist be the bag man. I guess the author was thinking too much about having Tom Cruise as the hero. Oh well. Good beach book, but again, Doug Kennedy seemed to do a ""cut and paste"" job during the last 35% of the book."
4,One of Kennedy's best.,This book is a retread for me. The writing is not what I had remembered but the story is great. It begins with a stereotypical power couple enjoying their upper middle class lifestyle when with a twist or two of fate the whole thing becomes a nightmare. Not great literature but a compelling story. If you liked The Firm then this is a great book for you.
4,Another good review,"I read this via audio book and what a great story. The novel is well written, easy to follow and picture and a good read by the story teller.I recommend this book for anyone seeking mystery, thriller type of business and corporate style stories. There is also some romance which makes the story quite interesting. Good rating from me and I agree that lengthy reviews can sometimes be annoying. It's a good suggestion to read reviews after having read the novel, but then again there, what's the point if you are searching amazon to make a purchase.Good read, highly recommended."
3,good,"I was not there: unlike some of the reviewers here, I was busy sucking my thumb and wetting my Pampers in 1969 when this came out. I came to Wool through an Andy Votel mix calledMusic to Watch Girls Cry.This is very good--nothing to out of the ordinary for the time, but enough straightforward rock, fuzz rock, blues, to go around.Truth be told, a lot of smaller bands did this type of album then--a little rock, a little blues, a little psych, maybe some avant-gaurdeBut Wool does this effectively, and the album works well as music, not just an artifact."
4,Noah's background,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYAs he is wont to do, Morris introduces parents, grandparents, siblings, and friends of Noah, creating much backstory. Much of the book is build up to when Noah at last gets his orders to build the ark."
1,Careful - Full Screen Rather than the Original Aspect Ratio,"I just received my DVD copy of Ship of Fools & was disappointed that it is presented in the hackneyed, butchered Standard/Full Screen rather than respecting the original aspect ratio. Such tampering/butchering should be illegal. It's not only a rippoff to the film's admires but its being sold without clearly warning the customer."
2,Lengthy soap opera overshadows social commentary,"This movie starts out as an ensemble drama examining the racial, religous and class prejudices onboard a cruise ship bound for a newly-Nazified Germany in 1933. Unfortunately, it turns into a wordy mess of a soap opera, that focuses far too much attention on the unsympathetic, frankly pathetic characters played by George Segal and Elizabeth Ashley. By the end of the two and a half hours, I was hoping one would throw the other overboard!In the documentary included with the version in the Stanley Kramer box set, Ashley says that Ship of Fools is the best movie of her career...what does that say about her career?"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Ship of Fools tells the story of various passengers on an ocean liner heading for pre-WWII Nazi Germany by unwisely ignoring the more interesting sociopolitical themes in order to focus on the more leaden soap opera type interactions between the passengers; something of a forerunner to Irwin Allen's later blockbusters in this regard (though without a disaster) it's not a film to make time for.
2,Skip this one,"Sorry, Richard, I usually enjoy your books, but this is one of the worst novels I have read in a long time. The twists and turns and inane repetitions of chases and mysterious meetings and people getting killed just as they were going to reveal some useful bit of information grew tiresome very quickly, and the clunky dialogue, wooden characters and plethora of typos certainly didn't help. Still, I stuck with it, hoping that the revelatory twist would make up for everything. Yet, when it came, I--like the beleaguered main character--was justifiably angry at its inanity."
1,Hard To Believe Matheson Wrote This Book,"I don't review books very often, but this book is so terrible, that I almost feel compelled to do so.Richard Matheson is a great writer, and if you look at the front of this book, you'll see quite a few 5 star reviews by famous authors. That's what got me to read this book.Unfortunately, this must be one of the worst books I have ever read. I find it unbelievable that the same person who wrote I AM LEGEND wrote this; it's simply full of terribly writing. The plot is weak; the main character is extremely annoying, and the love interest is hard to buy, as well. What made her fall in love with him? Why?Whatever you do, don't waste your time reading this."
2,wrong buy,"I bought this CD for the quaint but beautiful (well, I like it) version of 'Somewhere over a rainbow'. However, the other songs on the CD don't really appeal to me. You have to be a fan of Hawaian music, and I didn't know whether I was or not (I have not visited Hawa yet) but clearly I am not. I am not saying this is a bad CD. I am sure those who like Hawaian-style music will love it. It is just not my thing."
2,Somewhere?,Ok I bought this cd for Somewhere over the Rainbow. It is the only tune I like on the album so I didnt want to give it 1 star. But if i rated by # of songs I actually listen to it would have gotten only a 1.But somewhere over the rainbow is one of the best tunes I think I have ever heard. I love it.
5,"Magnificient music, at once beautiful and heartbreaking","We heard the track ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" on the radio on a recent trip to Hawaii, and bought this CD as a result. Our 4-year old loves it because the music is beautiful. I also love the music, but the message about condominium-ized paradise breaks my heart every time I listen.Iz knew how to entertain and how to get his message across."
5,Magical!,"I've just ""discovered"" Iz, and have bought this CD plus another one. Now I'm tempted to buy everything he ever produced. This giant of a man was a rare talent, and had the most wonderful voice - I'm so sorry to learn that it's been silenced.I bought this CD for the beautiful ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"". I've heard only clips of this song before, and was enchanted, but didn't know the artist's name. I've been searching for many months, and finally learned it was him. The song is one of my favorites on this CD, but two others are every bit as captivating. ""Ka Huila Wai"" simply carries me away to a magical place, and ""Ka Pua U'i"" has nearly the same effect. The rest of the songs are good, but those three alone make this CD worth having."
5,Haunting,"Traditional, and contemporary Hawaiian sounds make this my favorite of anything I've heard from IZ. A must have. You'll think so too."
5,Facing Future,"Calming, relaxing music of the Islands with interesting arrangements of familiar songs. A new take on Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Don't drive while listening."
4,Iz,I love this Hawaiian singers approach to the songs he sings. His voice is very soothing and it is something totally different than what I usually listen to.
5,One of the Greatest CDs EVER!!,"I have never heard a voice so beautiful. IZ was responsible for introducing me to the world of Pacific Islander music, and it is now all that I listen to. White Sandy Beach of Hawai'i takes me back to Oahu and the beautiful beaches and people. I will forever be greatful for IZ and his music. I hope his music recieves all of the recognition he and it deserves. May he rest in peace."
5,great cd,was looking a long time to get the song of somewhere over the rainbow by iz. i can listen to it over and over again.
5,Out of this World,"The voice has a glorious quality and he does not oversing. His version of ""Take Me Home Country Road"" was special not only for his substitution of his Hawai'ian homeland instead of West Virginia but how his vocal mannerism made him own the song more than the Rocky Mountain singers. His other Hawai'ian songs benefited from his subtly engaging voice and were ably complemented by his ukulele. His smoother than smooth vocals has an indigenous quality in it that suggests something unschooled and at the same time, a knowing and deliciously innocent quality. Of course, his version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World"" takes me to the high heavens. Over the rainbow indeed."
5,Iz' version of OVER THE RAINBOW was brilliant,"I bought this album just for his rendition of 'OVER THE RAINBOW' in a style so far away from Judy Garland, but so unique in its creation that it brings a lump to your throat. Worth it for this track alone, the rest are native Hawaiian melodies and language songs but they didn't really do anything for me. A shame he died so young due to his weight illness, but a fantastic legacy that I'll have for the rest of my life."
4,Another IZ classic!,"Since I am not from Hawaii I don't profess to identify with the political and cultural aspects of IZ's music, so all I can really say is that I find IZ's music just plain nice to listen to, especially when its just him and his uke. Need to relax, need to kick back and drift away to the Islands then this will do it for you. Get rid of the pills and pick up a dose of IZ to calm the tensions of the day. Of course you'll have to resist to go out and purchase a one way ticket to Hawaii.....or will you?"
5,Facing Future CD,"At first I was mainly trying to find Israel Kamakowiwo'ole's version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", and was a little disappointed about the mix, but after listening to the entire CD I found I really enjoyed all of it. I've never been to Hawaii, but I know about the Hula, and I felt pretty confident that several of the songs would be a great choice for that. Israel has such a beautiful voice, and the stories in the music were interesting. I still like the unmixed version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" better than the mix, though."
5,Does anyone NOT miss IZ?,"I lived in Maui for a year in 1962-63, my first year of college. There was one traffic signal on the island then and a population of about 35,000 population. Israel was about 4 years old then so I never got to hear him sing. I lost touch with Hawaii for 40 years. I found IZ just stumbling around YouTube and now I listen to him every day. I'm told he died at age 38 in 1997 and this CD is still the most played CD in Hawaii. It renews my respect for Hawaii and the Hawaiian people and the basics of life (sun, sand, stars, sound of the ocean, moon, music, family and friends). Hawaii is the right brain of America and all the Mainland the left brain. We need Hawaii for balance. You can see IZ is very heavy and on the CD you can occasionally hear the sign of a heavy person. His heart and soul were bigger than his body and his voice is so heavenly you will love this CD."
4,Beautiful Hawaiian Music,This is a great (and last recorded) CD by Israel. IZ and his ukalele are really outstanding with his song Over The Rainbow.
2,Sorry - disappointing,"Found myself wanting to turn it off before the ending. And saying to myself, boring. If a movie is based in reality,I find it very hard to concentrate on the movie when presented with a string of non-sensical events. Basically, ithad it's moments, but mostly felt like a waste of my time. Just watched it for the first time last night."
3,Buy the cheaper DVD version,"I got my copy on sale at a very low price. Luckily. I can't tell the difference from the DVD version I already own. Both sound and picture quality are the same as the DVD version. Save money, buy the DVD version. The movie ""The Island"" is a good example. The Blu-ray version is a big step up from the DVD version. But not Collateral."
3,"Watchable, very violent, average film",Tom Cruise is a wacky hitman who provides some funny lines between sensless shootings. I could never get over the fact that it was Tom which I think is the primary job of an actor. I was like 'no wonder Nicole left this goofball' the whole film. Jamie Foxx is excellent except his shift from lifelong cabbie to action hero is as tough to swallow as the superhot prosecutor's interest in dating him.This movie is way more violent than you might think since it is sort of a comedy.
4,Good,"I heard the plot outline and thought to myself this doesn't have the makings for a good movie. Why would a hit man choose a cabbie to drive him around? Why would this be interesting? But, I had similar thoughts before seeing ""The Insider"" - why would a movie about a corporate whistle blower be interesting. Now, ""The Insider"", along with ""Heat"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", and ""Manhunter"" are some of my favorite movies. After seeing Collateral, I surprisingly really didn't have a problem with the issue of why a hit-man would have a cabbie drive him around from hit to hit. But, it didn't live up to other Michael Mann movies that I love. It seemed like a long version of an RHD episode. If you want an entertaining movie, this will suffice. If you want Michael Mann at the top of his form, this isn't it."
4,Story was a little goofy but the imagery extraordinary,"The film seemed somewhat implausable, but if you watch it for the imagery, colors and cinematography, it's a remarkable film. The film depicts a third-shift LA as a very bleak, electric land of concrete. The filmwork really captivates, so this makes for a great film visually, but storywise it is somewhat silly (a contract killer... hires a cab?)"
2,"Yeah, right - lots of coininkidinks!","What are the chances of some cabbie picking up a fare that is later targeted on the same night by a different fare for murder. I say, Zilch! Its almost what this stupid movie is worth - 0 stars. But I was in a generous mood and gave it 2, only for the visual experience. Bad plot, bad script are the tale of this movie. Seeing all these positive reviews tells me more about the dumbing down of American society than anything!"
2,The Second Worst Movie of 2004!,"There's something about this movie that you really want to like. It looks good at the beginning. Cruise is rather convincing in his role. Foxx does a fine job...But in the end, the movie leaves you empty and wanting more! This should have been a longer movie, and with more genuine plot twists. Instead, we are left with a predictable movie that seemed to waste more time than anything else.At times, the film was too simplistic to take seriously and not even Tom Cruise could save this formulaic film."
2,"Decent action, terrible story","First of all, I don't know who Michael Mann is. I've gotta look him up.Second of all, I'm writing because I'm surprised by the positive reviews for this movies. I finished this movie in half the time. It was just corny, predictable, and all in all pretty lame. 2.5 stars, mostly for the action scenes. The characters, while not wholly one-dimensional, are too easily read. There is no complexity, which makes it a subpar drama. It's also a lame action movie because of the ill-disguised attempts to put artificial depth into the characters. I find most of the dialog agonizing to sit through.But at least I finished the movie."
2,Too bad your money wasn't collateral.,"I think this movie is being way too over-praised. I foundevery lingering moment of the movie to be draining. I quicklyfound myself void of interest, energy, and sanity. Tom Cruiseand Jamie Foxx have succeeded in stealing away two hours of mylife. Two hours that I will never get back. Opt for a rental ifyou just -have- to see it."
2,One-sentence review: Collateral,"Hollywood, yet again, gives France a run for its euros as the world leader in production of cheese in general and Brie (the kind movie critics savor), as we watch Tom Cruise's eminently existential struggle to, once and for all, choose whether he wants to look like an eminently existential hitman like eminently noir Jean Reno (also because that's how Tom learned to play Vincent) or an eminently crazy-eyed but spouting eminently existential one-liners (because they pay him) Christopher Walken (also because that's how he learned to play Max -- before the line producer collated the script properly)."
3,Collateral is in between good and bad,"Alright. Some part were worth it, some weren't. The beginning was very slow paced and boring. If had something else to do, I would have abandoned watching the movie after the first 20 minutes. Luckily, as time went on, it got better. The transformation of Max's character was very well done and the plot actually wasn't bad, it just provided some boring scenes. The conclusion was easily the films best part. It became a fast breath-taking chase in a skyscraper as Max raced to rescue a woman that he had driven in has cab earlier from Vincent. Had the whole movie been as well done as the last thirty minutes it would have been spectacular. Overall not bad but it could have been much better. And by the way, after the club scene, how did all the cops just forget about them and disappear?"
4,Very Good,"I thought this was very good, certainly good for a night's entertainment. I thought both Cruise and Foxx were good, but probably not for a nomination (must be a slow year in movies). Cruise has his ""Mission:Impossible"" mode and Foxx changes from a waddling to active state back to waddling, but you always want him to pull through."
3,Tom Cruise as Terminator,"The feel of the movie was like watching Terminator 1, replacing Arnold with Tom Cruise . Even thought this is fiction, the story was missing some touch of reality. How can a cab driver be forced to drive a killer around, with 100s of opportunites to get out of it? How can a killer walk into a club packed with police, kill the man he is looking for, and just get away? Too many questionable scenes like that in the movie. Tom Cruise did a good job playing the bad guy, not as good as Arnold though!"
4,Good Movie,"I watched Collateral for about 10 minutes and fell in love with Foxx's charecter. Foxx play ""Max"" taxi driver with dreams but not actions. Tom Cruise plays ""Vincent"" a hitman that is as cool as ice and you can not help but like him. Throughout the movie Max drives Vincent across LA to different assasination points all the while discusing everything from the philosophy of killing a man to the improvisation of jazz. Overall I thought the movie was great. I thought the screen play was spot on, the plot twist was not predictable, and the way Mann filmed LA at night was simply beautiful. The scene where the car was parked at a light and you see the silhouette of the palm trees against the incandescent LA sky was gorgeous, along with the three coyotes. The only thing i did not like about the movie was the shift from a psychological thriller to a shoot-em-up action movie near the end, i really enjoyed the dialogue a lot."
1,Constructive criticsm,Sorry I can't review this product. It was designed for another region; not the United States. It wouldn't play. These manufacturers of dvds need to start putting the region on their labels. I don't know what to do with it.
3,It's Just OK,I'll make this brief. Plot is promising but film had a bit of dragging moments enough to put you to sleep just to be waken up again at the end because it suddenly becomes a fast paced thriller. Bonus disc has not much to offer either that would be interesting enough to see. This is just my opinion thou and I dont represent the view of the general public.
1,don't waste your time,I was excited about watching this movie. Really like the cast members and had heard good reviews. The movie got worse and worse as it went on. Totally unrealistic and too coincidental. Jamie Foxx was the only thing that held it together at all. I could not wait for it to end..
4,Good Purchase,The case has proven to be good protection for my Sansa View (e200) so far. I haven't dropped it yet to find out if it's shatter proof. But since the case is showing a lot of scratches i'm just happy that those scratches aren't on my MP3 player.
5,Inspiring and life changing!,"Down-to-earth, honest and real account of how God has changed a man, willing to risk everything to trust God. It will inspire and challenge you to experience God in your every-day life!A great book for people who are seeking God but turned off by hypocritical and religious ""Christians"" who believe they are better than everyone else."
5,Faith like potatoes,"I got to listen to Angus Buchan speak at World Outreach Church in Murfreesboro TN. It was his first trip to America.He is a remarkable, God loving man and speaker. This book just magnifies the faith all people should have in God."
4,Beautiful,"Enjoy the tranquil artwork of Thomas Kinkaid, coupled with soothing verse about the wonders of the garden from the likes of Helen Keller, Jane Eyre and others, in BEYOND THE GARDEN GATE. This smallish coffee table book will be thoroughly enjoyed by all who open it."
4,Great beginner train set,"This set was bought for my 3 year old for his birthday. The train is quite simple, but seems durable. The cars and engine hook together with a magnet which is great since he is not asking me to hook them together every minute. After watching me set it up a few times, he can now put the track together all by himself. Great product!"
4,A classic,"...I read this book last year and it was so interesting that I still remember it today. The story was about a young boy named Carl and his cousin. They get lost in the wilderness and there is a storm moving in, along with that it is getting dark. They were getting desperate when they found a hidden shack in the woods with smoke coming out of the chimney. This story kept me guessing throughout the story. Then this young boy and his cousin went home the next morning. Then his cousin went back to see the man. I thought that was kind of dumb because how many young boys would go back in the middle of no wear and go to this house were a scary man lives."
5,Foxman by gary paulsen,"The book starts out when the boy was sent to live with his uncle.He and his brother find a shack in the woods. They find out a man lives there who's half man - half fox. He is called Foxman.The kid was out in the snow too long. The kid went snowblind.Luckly the foxman helped. A lot of sad stuff happens when someone dies.I like foxman because I like snow and winter. This book is best for kids who like wilderness, snow, winter and discoveries in the wild."
2,"Pretty pictures, no Goddesses. Where's the Goddess here?","This calendar has NOTHING to do with the Goddess; nothing about the feast days, culture, or even her history. The pictures are pretty but they are only pictures of females that Susan Seddon Boulet found appealing. After the Sage Woman calendars (no longer in print) I've used for the past several years, this is a real disappointment. Being an 'international' calendar, it does not even have important dates marked. Instead, a sheet of tags is included to mark national days and it doesn't even include tags for Goddess-oriented celebrations! It's a farce, a fake. Truth in Advertising would call it a ""generic picture calendar""."
2,Below Neal Schon's standard,"I am pro-Neal Schon. I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date. However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars. It simply does not meet the mark on this one.None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you. These aren't songs that will stick in your head. Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate. If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by ""Beyond the Thunder...."" one of his best to date. These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine. Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.I was disappointed on this one. Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world. He just didn't hit the mark on this one."
4,Awesome Instrumental CD,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Journey. So naturally I approach this CD with some positive bias. BUT, I am also a big fan of instrumental CDs of all sorts, including New Age, Movie Soundtracks, what have you. I have bought most of Joe Satriani's albums and I am a big fan of Eddie Van Halen. I personally think that guitar work on this album is superior to any of Neal Schon's previous albums. The emotion and soul that this album evokes is definitely superior. Maybe some people who love Satriani, Steve Vai, or Malmsteen won't think this guitar album measures up, BUT when one listens to this album as an instrumental CD IT IS SPECTACULAR. This music grabs me and moves me. I love it. I love this CD. I love Neal Schon. Wow. This CD has emotion and soul and it is just gorgeous and moving music."
2,Colossal disappointment,"Mom and grandad built this because he lost interest after ten minutes when we were still figuring out which way round everything went. A bunch of tiny screws that mom had to screw into very fragile plastic. No explanation to kids about what the parts of the engine actually did in reality. A much smaller toy than we imagined and once it is built you'd be absolutely crazy to take it apart to construct again. There is no way an 8 yr old would have the mental endurance or interest to stay with this project from start to finish. But hey, it lights up!"
1,Piece of Junk -- Do Not Buy!,"My son got this model for Christmas. He was very excited to put it together. We are a mechanically minded family and relish these kinds of challenges. HOWEVER, this model and its instructions are so poorly executed, that it is doomed to fail. DO NOT be misled by the ""Smithsonian"" name -- I doubt this product has anything at all to do with our nation's most wonderful museum. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Tips for assembly,"Yes, yes to the other reviews. Lots of potential, but a disaster as is.Do this at a minimum:Use a high-quality screwdriver. Don't bother with the included one.Drill out every screw hole with a 5/64th bit. The screws will still be hard to get in all the way. You might want to also do what I did: After the 5/64th bit, use a 3/32 bit just a little ways into the screw holes, so there is less self-tapping the screw has to do. If you drill all the way to the bottom of the holes with the 3/32nd, the screws will just fall in. (If you have an 11/128th bit, you're probably set! Never heard of one of those though.)"
5,These sellers are ripping you off!,These sellers are trying to gain themselves a $140.00 profit from you by selling a book that is advertised for $35.00 on Senta Maria's website. Please save your money and take the time to look elsewhere for this book.
2,Average,"Jaheim is a Singer's Singer. Bro Man has the tools to be a Teddy Pendergrass for His Generation,but alot of the material he gets never challenges him. I look at cats like Jaheim&Dave Hollister&think if only they had better material they would be scary. this Album is alright,but alot of it sounds like his 2nd album in a Outtake kind of way.He should be getting better material."
3,Not Exactly Ghetto classics....more like Old School Classics,"1st off I love Jahiem's voice. His voice is smooth and soulful. I don't know what expectations I had for this Album, but I'm not exactly satisfied. I like old school music, but I wasn't expecting Jahiem to dedicate an album to it. But this opinion is only based on a two round listen. Maybe it'll take a few more times to give it another listen. But if u love his voice and that old school sound...you'll love this album. You be the judge.Peace"
2,What! Ja WHO? Can't be!,"This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me. This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed."
2,Not as good as his first albums,"Same theme and style all the way through almost monotone, nothing stood out on this one. I played once and it's sitting on the shelf."
3,I Am Number Four,"I redbox this movie for my teen sister and I to watch...I thought the film overall was very entertaining and the characters were very good. Sister and I did not read the books so we did not really have anything to compare it to, but we thought it was just ok. The movie pick up, I would not say it is the best movie ever but it was just ok."
2,Action is good but not enough and too much Icky Sticky High Schooly Poo Poo,"I would have liked this movie (more) if it had moved fast like SALT. Unfortunately, it is way too saturated with (to put it mildy) high school gumi poo poo. A little less high school poo poo and more action would have pleased even the HS crowd and brought in more mature audiences. Straight up, not enough action! Disappointing. Poor studio, director, writer judgement. Certainly the overall draw was/is/will be impacted by this lack of insight. Rich with inane highschoolish nonsense."
5,Fun to Watch,"Enjoyed the concepts and story line. Good action sequences. I liked the roles of the characters, especially the beagle puppy."
5,Loved it,"Ok, whens the next one coming out. This movie was awesome. Great plot and story. Awesome conclusion but left me wanting more please!!"
4,Great movie,I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. It doesn't have great reviews besided to buck the system and try it anyway. I found the plot to be easy to follow but with unexpected twists and turns. I especially appreciated the introduction and later help received by the dog. I highly recommend this movie.
3,"Not bad, and I wanted to read the rest","A good premise somewhat brought down by average writing and a ""yo, dude"" flavor. I did enjoy the movie, which prompted me to buy the book. It was nice to get some details in writing, but I did get impatient sometimes with all these teens and their angst. However, I was sucked in enough to continue to purchase the books because now I need to know what happens! I really like Bernie Kosar!"
1,WAS THIS A MOVIE OR A LONG IPHONE COMMERIAL?,"Before i explain the title of my review,Let me first review the movie !!IT SUCKED!! Ok moving on this movie was like the longest iphone commerial i have ever seen in my life,If he was not anwsering calls on his iphone every two minutes he was receiving texts and putting the phone all in the camera.Nothing agaist the iphone or apple because i own one but damn that was clearly in your face advertisment.Oh! And one more thing how the hell do you live under the radar and live off the grid with a cell phone?"
3,Good Story Line,Great movie with a good story line though it is a bit over the top with some of the scenes and concepts. There are a few parts that SCI FI lovers will see from other movies of the like.
3,Interesting. Good rental!,"The plot is predictable but the acting is decent! Some of the special effects were interesting and their ""abilities"" continued to get better. It is obvious that they left the ending open for a sequel, but we'd rent that too!"
3,Entertaining Movie,"I liked the movie, but they could have done so much more with it. On a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is totally unpredictable and 10 is ""seen it"", I would give this movie an 8...Leaning towards 9..Personally I am not going to purchase the disk, but it is fun to watch if you just want some brain candy."
4,I would watch the sequel if there is one....,"Movie was good. The action was not so bad, when there was some, and story was ok. They set up for a second movie, so watch this in case there is a second one."
3,"So, so movie","I am number four is a so, so movie that suffers from an uninteresting female love interest and a plot that all to familiar. Come on the high school trials and tribulations of a superhero has been done to death (remember superman and spiderman). It would have been nice if this movie had taken a different approach. Henri was one of the best characters and it would have been nice to have seen him take on the bad guys at little more. He should have been even better than number 6 since he was a protector. It will be interesting to see if we get a sequel."
3,Decent movie,"This movie pretty much split the difference for me. The beginning and middle of the movie were a little shaky, seeming unoriginal and almost silly at times. I understand they were aiming for character development, but because the audience already knows so much about the main character, and the big picture, the events seem trivial. In the last third of the movie things pick up. The characters get a little more interesting, and the action (and accompanying special effects) are well done. Overall I'd say decent, not great movie."
2,Made for younger guys,"Good movie for high school and college guys, maybe, but it didn't get a thumbs up in my household, where we have one middle aged guy and lots of females!"
4,Action,"Superb cast and acting talent here! Lots of action and drama in this one. Enjoy it, I did as well!"
3,Well!!!!!!,"This movie had some good action and plot, but I was disappointed in the ending. It was the typical syfy movie with teenagers."
3,Entertaining If You Don't Expect Much,"Dealing with intergalactic invasion, corporeal powers, and laser guns, Four is a relatively tame creation, lacking a thunderous, textured cinematic quality that would separate it from the average ABC Family movie."
5,love this,I got this for myself after ordering it twice on cable love this movie love the quality hoping there is a number 5 haha
4,Gets Interesting After a Slow Start,"The first few scenes seem to be going in the direction of a teenage high school flick with the usual suspects appearing in their assigned roles. Fortunately the movie doesn't lose too much time before it shifts gear to more of a sci-fi adventure flick with some interesting twists and turns.As the movie progresses we get vicious alien invaders and space monsters, not to mention shape shifters and lovely alien heroines. All told this rather traditional mix results in an entertaining sci-fi adventure that held my attention all the way to the sort of end.I say sort of end because it definitely screams sequel to me; the story stops with no conclusive resolution to the main problem. If we don't see a sequel to this one it will only be because the receipts don't justify it; I suppose time will tell and I certainly wish them well."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. There was enough action to keep entertained and enough supernatural events incorporated for it to remain interesting. It is a bit refreshing to see a movie that is not based on a book, cartoon, television show, is a remake, comes out in 3D, is a prequel or a sequel - unless of course this falls into one of these categories and I just do not know it :o)"
2,Mislabled 16:9 Widescreen,"The LionsGate version of this title is clearly labeled ""16:9 Widescreen"" in one location and also has a large logo on the the back of the cover which states - (16x9 WIDESCREEN 1.78:1 DVD SCREEN FORMAT). However, the actual dvd is presented in a letterboxed 1.85:1 format without anamorphic enhancement. The LionsGate version is still the only version of this film worth having on DVD but there is no excuse for the false advertising."
2,Another Charles Bronson crank em out movie.,"If you have money to burn, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, save your money, your time and forget about them."
2,john rowles hits,Cheryl Moana Marie is as good as I remember from years ago. 99% of the others songs are ones that other artists originally did. I didn't like John's versions of the songs.
2,Research driven book limited in appeal to us common folks,"A scholarly, in depth study of sexual politics. Of no interest to me, an 80 year old grandma with an RN and PhD in Health Education. I bought it wanting a resource for sex education with teens at church. It was not what I needed."
4,how u luv that? phattest cd ever,yeeah how u luv that? this cd has got some phat beats in it and the lyrics are dope. u gotta luv the song ballin'...and don't hate me... now i know u would luv that playboy... u gotta buy this cd if you like 400 degreez
3,"Not The Worst, But Not The Best Either...","Patrick Doyle didn't do a bad job - I rate this better than the Chamber of Secrets soundtrack. However, Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favourite Harry Potter soundtrack followed by the Philosopher's Stone."
3,Epic=noisy?,"I like Doyle's flighty tone for this score, but I hate the fact that there's very little subtlety. It's just so noisy and simple. Where's the complexity of John Williams? The whole score pretty much uses the same beat and it grows tiresome after a while."
1,Dreadful,"Williams' scores had magic and grace... this is awful. In fact, it's rather a bit of a joke... it has none of the magic or flair that the first 3 soundtracks had. The movies may be getting better, but the soundtrack is one of my first complaints about this movie.HOPEFULLY fore OOP they will return to the WIlliams' magical score. I'm a collector of Potter merchandise-- I have absolutely everything Potter, even the bedsheets, to tell you how obsessed I am. BUT this I will not buy.Don't waste your money. You couldn't give it to me."
1,The worst sound track of all of them,"This soundtrack was by far the worst of the Harry potter movies.First off I realize that you can't keep all of the original music, but at least keep the theme of the movies. ""Death of Cedric"" would have been much better if they had used the original theme. Overall I am ashamed of this soundtrack, as it is an insult to the Harry potter franchise"
2,Go Back to Williams or go to Howard Shore,I was very disappointed to listen to this soundtrack. If I could I would take it back. I currently have all the soundtracks and this is the worst. I wish they would go back to Williams or even better Howard Shore of LOTR fame. He did an excellent job with the triology.
3,Lose shape after a few hours,"When you first put them on in the morning, they look great and fit great. But due to the low spandex content--or ratio of spandex to cotton--they are a stretched out baggy mess after three to four hours. I have three different styles of their ""One True Fit"" line and I've had the same issue with all three. So if you're just headed out for a lunch with friends or errands, great. But by the end of a workday, you'll look pretty rumpled. I do live in a high humidity area and this may not be the case with if you live in a dry climate."
4,"Nice fit, too long","I should have read the review before mine because I am 5'3, but these pants seem really long. However, besides that the fit is really nice and they look great."
3,"You get what you pay for, generally","I was hoping that this microphone would produce great sound however my internal microphone actually sounds better. If you are looking for a more professional quality mic, do not be cheap and purchase this mic. With that being said for the price this microphone is okay for basic use, however I wish the quality was better so I could use it for interviews. I would NOT purchase this microphone again, and I would not recommend it to others."
5,Great Mic,"I have a hobby that some might find a bit strange, I post video game playthoroughs on the internet with live commentary. I needed a mic with good sound quality and pick-up that wasn't going to break my wallet, when I ran across this mic I checked out some videos on youtube to see if some people had test footage of the quality, I found a few but not many and the test didn't show what I really wanted to know, either way I went for the mic. At this low price and for the quality it provides me I think this was a bargain, I would go so far as to compare it to the same quality you'd get with a Blu Snowball mic (Which I also own), Not to say that it's equal to the Snowball. If you need further proof, head over to my youtube site and check out any of my Dead Space 2 Playthroughs, I started using this mic at Parts 17 and up. [...]"
5,works for me!,I love the clip. The sound quality on my video recordings are sooo much better now. I'm glad I got this. Great find and fairly priced!
4,handy little attachment,"Inexpensive, very functional. Increases the sound quality of my personal digital voice recorder. Only problem is you get mono sound, which actually tends to work better for many spoken word recordings. Not what you want for music, but lectures recorded in stereo get distracting as the speaker moves from one channel to the next. If you want a good small stereo mike, check out the Olympus ME-51S. It will be about twice the price though."
5,The Best Little Microphone in Amazon,I like it a lot. It works good. I would recommend it to everyone. Buy one now!
3,Remote microphone for voice recorder,"Haven't had a chance to use it, but it looks simple and sturdy enough to provide long term use. The alligator clip is sturdy with good spring compression, and opens to about 3/8"". The lead is long enough to support a variety of remote placement options... under clothes, sofa cushion, etc."
1,Broke into 2 pieces after 3 uses,"Very disappointed. Used three times and the plastic part that covers the microphone separated and fell off. It left the metal mic and wires exposed. I could not get the plastic cover to stay on. This didn't cost a ton of money, but it costs enough. I was unable to return it because I missed the return date by one day, which was totally my fault. I'm looking for another one and will probably invest more money into the next lapel mic I purchase AND also keep better track of return dates!"
2,DOES NOT FIT,"This item is SMALLER in diameter than the stock rotor. The pads are 1/3 off the rotor because of it. These went on my junker 'Scort, so I'm not going through the hassle of returning them, but they are said to fit the 95 Escort LX and I'm here to tell you, they don't!"
1,just stop working after 2 months,"Af first, it worked well, and very warm. But it just stopped working after 2 months. So don't buy it!!"
5,Wonderful!,"The SPT SH-1507 is THE best space heater I have ever owned. My initial impression of high quality molded components carried over to its first use. The manufacturer spent some time and money developing the SPT SH-1507.One of the most impressive aspects of the SPT SH-1507 is the noise level - the very reason for its purchase. Used at work I can talk on the phone and be unaware the unit is running.However, the best aspect is the SPT SH-1507 is it will run on the low setting, warm the room nicely and NOT trip the breaker like the other systems I had purchased previously.If my words mean anything to you, put your hesitancy aside about taking the plunge for this space heater."
2,Disappointed,This small heater was a disappointment. I've owned smaller heaters that did a much better job. Don't waste your money.
2,Fan part failed within 7 months of little use,This fan is compact and easy to use. I enjoyed while it worked. Unfortunately the fan part stopped running within 7 months of occasional use. Since the fan failed it could not dissipate heat from the ceramic element and it would stop completely.
2,Faulty Product,"This heater is attractively designed, and when it works it heats my 200sf room quietly and efficiently. Unfortunately there appears to be a fault with the thermostat, and the unit stopped operating properly soon after I received it. It cuts out a couple of minutes after being switched on, regardless of what setting it's on, or external temperature. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Don't expect this heater to live beyond its warranty,"I spent $12 returning this heater for warranty repair. After I got it back, it worked on some days and not on others. Lesson: junk the junk, don't waste money on warranty repair or talking to the repair department. Sunpentown admitted my heater got the ""sunshine treatment"" since, they said, nothing was wrong with it.Beautiful white/orange plastic housing with cheap electronics inside. That's the Sunpentown SH-1507. Companies like Sunpentown give China a bad name. Don't waste your money.Today, I bought a Dyson heater for $290+ (Amazon, Costco, etc.). Designed in Great Britain but made in Asia (Malaysia). So far, so good."
4,Puts off plenty of heat,"I opted for this heater and combined it with a plug in thermostat and I run it in my young daughters room. The idea of an electric heater in a child's room freaks me out but her room stays considerably cooler than the others upstairs. We tried pumping up the heat but then our other daughter and ourselves are too hot. This heater provides several safety features that help alleviate some of the worries. It has an anti-tip switch that shuts it off, and an over heat safety switch too. It is not blazing hot on the main surface but I would keep my hand on it too long. I just put it up on a dresser and put it far enough back to keep it out of reach. The cord is secured behind the dresser and I feal comfortable leaving it to run in her room. Combined with the thermostat it only runs as needed and I feel it is the safest setup for this situation."
4,Teacher review,This book is great for teachers. It's great for your classroom to teach a lesson with students. Cute story!
3,Can't cut corners.,"Concept good but features falls short. The tool is constructed nicely with good fit and finish, just not fully functional. The blade cannot reach/cut in tight corners because the thumb guard gets in the way. The saw and rasp are too blunt thus requiring more effort."
5,Why did they stop selling this in retail stores?,"I have used Lamisil pump spray for many years. It works very well. However, I can no longer find it in retail stores. I will continue to order it from Amazon as long as they continue to sell it."
2,"THE WORDS, THE LANGUAGE, AND ABSOLUTELY NO MORE!","I can hear the author, and I love his use of language. The story is strictly an opportunity to sing words - no purpose, no redemption, no character or plot development - no reason for being except to create marvellous, magnificent crescendos and rolling chords of words."
1,too much effort to read totally boring,"I wanted to read this book with as much enthusisasm and zest with which i read Angelas ashes. How disappointed I was,Maybe I should have tried to read this first,but unfortunatey i gave up reading this book. I am glad I borrowed it from the library and didnt buy it.I couldnt find anything interesting about Malachys life,i suspect this was only published due to the great success of his brothers book.for me this is a big literary disappointment.a big let down sorry Mr McCourt."
1,The worst book of the year.,"In a documentary film about the McCourt family, Malachy lamented that in the wake of ""Angela's Ashes,"" he was destined to be known forevermore as Frank McCourt's little brother -- an honor anyone with a normal ego would relish. But with the publication of ""A Monk Swimming,"" Malachy has consigned himself to be known forevermore as Frank McCourt's PATHETIC little brother. His writing is cute enough to make you gag, and his story reveals him to be a thoroughly repellant character to anyone but his fellow alcoholics and casual wick-dippers. I hope he has made enough money from this dreadful book to retire without ever writing another word."
1,Poor choice,"This is a book that wouldn't be published but for his brother's book. There's no merit in following the story of a man whose sole purpose in life is his own pleasure (which he repeats over and over), glorifying in his own downfall, while knowing that he's hurting others. This is literally a man who can't understand why his wife left him, just because he stays out all night drinking and sleeping with other women. ""I prove my love by getting completely pie-eyed.""On one occasion he breaks down the door of his separated wife's apartment with a chair, while his children are present, and breaks up the place. When arrested, he shows no remorse, but turns it into a funny story to tell at his favorite bar. What's wrong with that? He's Malachy, after all."
1,a monk swimming,"This particular McCort appears a shameless purveyor of a unique variety of Irish malarky, known by some as malachyarkey. And if you part with your hard earned to actually purchase the title, you may subsequently feel like adding your own sobriquet to the considerable list of innocents what have been bilked.So go on over to the nearest biblioteca and read a few pages, here and there. Soon enough you will perceive the boozy theme. And you will probably agree the drinking and drunkenness quickly wears thin. Little else happens. More drinking, and - more drinking.A dismal, repetitive, boring tale."
4,Enjoyed but...,"...didn't find this book as engaging as his brothers books. Enjoyed the humor, was LOL many times with this read!"
5,Weird Title,"I had really enjoyed Frank Mc Cord's books, and bought this one because of his ability to write, and feel that all the Mc Cords are authors, and glad I invested in their books. Would be glad to buy from this company again."
2,"Stories meant to be heard, not read","I have no doubt that if I was in a pub with Mr. McCourt, and he started telling stories, I would be enthralled. He is the quintessential Irish storyteller. Unfortunately, his patter doesn't translate to the page very well. His stories end up sounding forced, stilted, sometimes simply obscene. What may be missing here is the knowing smile or wink (which we'd see in the pub) that tell us what he's really thinking."
1,Blech!,"Let's face it... the only reason you'd look into reading this book is if you have already read and enjoyed Angela's Ashes. Well, don't bother. If there was some story line buried between the covers of this book, I never found it. I'm still wondering why I forced myself to read the whole thing! How anyone could think that name dropping, drinking and being a bad father and husband is great reading is beyond me."
3,OK. but sometimes a little dull,"A little too much of the dropping of names of those that he knew, along with some of the drunken tales making be wince. Give him credit that he's lived this long without losing the liver"
2,"Wash your mouth out with soap, Malachy","I was expecting to be charmed by another McCourt, but instead I was shocked by the use of profanity on the second page and then again in later chapters. Malachy, if you MUST use the f-word, please use the less offensive Irish version. It truly detracts from the book."
1,This mpnk dorwned,A Monk Swimming has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I am convinced that it was published because of the author's brother's literary success. Page after page of name dropping isn't a memoir.
3,What a life!,"I really enjoyed this story, a wickedly funny account of an outrageous life. What a life this guy led! My only disappointment is that at the end he didn't tell us how he (apparently) turned his life around. The negative reviews I read here must have been written by abstemious, uptight people with no sense of humor."
2,rip off,"This book was enjoyable but i'm sure some exagerations were involved. About 1/4 way through, much seemed as if i read this before. Then it came to me, this is a rip off of ""The Ginger Man"" by J.P. Donleavy. To my amazement, the author actually mentions this book later on. At least Donleavy's book was a novel.Big brother ought to smack the little brother for this."
2,"A hardy start, but loses drive towards the end","I was at first disgusted by Malachy McCourt's attempt to live off his brother Frank's success as a writer, but when I actually picked up A Monk Swimming, I was impressed by his originality and divorce from imitation. The first half or so of the book consists of some dubiously and some exceedingly funny tales told in creative, innovative language. Somewhere along the way, however, the book descends into a ultimate sameness, page after page: the drunkeness and sex escapades of the author. At the same time, Malachy runs out of ways to make English interesting. In the end, although a reformation is hinted at, none is ever really told, and the book is concluded with stories of Malachy's father, Malachy, which really don't fit the previous theme."
1,victriolic nonsense,"If you like pointless sarcastic vitriolic junk, buy this book. Mr McCourt has nothing good to say about anything. He attacks everything here, captitalism, God, religion, Ireland, England America, rich folk, poor folk, his family with absolutely no wisdom of any kind to contribute. He seems to find nobility in drunkeness, public nudity promiscuitity and profanity. What a waste."
1,Capitalizing on big bro's success,"I took two books with me for my extended plane flight - ""A Monk Swimming"" and ""Airframe"" by Crichton. Relatively scared of flying, I didn't realize that Airframe was about plane crashes until I was in the air. Upon trudging through 35 pages of ""A Monk Swimming"" I found that sitting in a cold sweat during each bump of the plane in turbulence, reading ""Airframe"", was better than reading what might be the worst book my eyes have ever scanned through."
3,It's not like Frankie,"A Monk Swimming was written by Malachy McCourt, the younger brother of Frank McCourt who wrote ""Tis"" and the world renowned ""Angela's Ashes."" Malachy was very different from his brother on his approach to the life story. Malachy told life as it was indifferent to him whether he survived or not. Malachy should learn a few things about writing from his brother, Frank before he under takes another book."
1,Riding Frank's Coattails,"A weak, feeble collection of tired barroom tales told to capitalize on Frank McCourt's success. Don't Bother"
5,Hypnotic,This is a wonderful performance of music that captivates the soul. I have listened to the recording repeatedly and yet keep coming back for more.
3,Works well but...,"Works as advertised, no more sweaty back in the heat, but it's a bit uncomfortable since it has to be stiff in order to channel the air properly, and mine didn't stay in one place, I ended up returning it and tinting my windows for some relief."
2,Not very cool,"I purchased this cooling car seat and was unfortunately disappointed. I have an old car with a broken a/c and thought this would help because the sweat marks on my clothing were getting embarrassing. But the amount of air that is projected through the holes in the seat cover is so small, it barely makes a difference. I thought initially it was broken because I couldn't feel anything until I held my hand right next to the holes and could slightly feel the air. I guess it's better than nothing, but I had hoped for the price, it would be more effective."
3,None is so blind ...,"Ancient Egyptians were not secretive. They carved their story in stone, using a sylllabary because the alphabet hadn't been invented, A syllabary is a set of symbols for each of the numerous sylllables; Japanese and Koreans today write mainly in syllabaries; for example, Japanese has one symbol for ""KA,"" a different symbol for ""NA"" and another for ""DA."" There are 50-some in Japanese, which is more than the 26 letters we find it convenient to read. Syllabaries are basically phonetic; Egypt's ancient writing system was forgetten for centuries, until a clever Frenchman realized that it was not picture-writing. He discovered the symbols for ""CLE"" ""O"" ""PA"" and ""TRA"" - and voila, the past came alive!Ventris realized that ""secret"" writing found in ancient Crete was actually Greek, using a forgotten sylllabary. Sadly, academic blindness (jealousy) darkened his short life. He wanted to be an architect."
5,Life's Lessons,"What a gem of a book! If you would like to be a good employee, a good student, a good parent, or a good person, then read this book. There are so many jewels to be had with this book. My advice is to take it slowly because I wanted to read this book so quickly. I didn't want to put it down! Enjoy..."
4,"Books is great, Amazon sucks","This review is more of Amazon's failure that anything detailing the book. Amazon has this listed as a ""hardback"". When I received the book, it was paperback. I asked for a replacement, which they promptly sent. However, it was another paperback. I tried using their telephone service but got someone that spoke poor English. The best I could understand they were going to correct the issue and send a replacement. It's been weeks with no word. Who knows what the guy actually told me."
5,Great buy!,"So happy to receive our floppy fleece elephant, a favorite of our dogs. Great transaction and great product!"
5,Wireless Keyboard for WebTV,The product was shipped in its original box. The keyboard is in good condition (wrapped in bubble wrap) and even included batteries. Also contained instructions.
5,It works!,"There is nothing like reading the news and surfing the web from one's lazy boy chair. That computer glare up close gets real old, real fast some days. How do I hook my computer up to a 72"" HD TV? hehe Is it Logotech that has the wireless keyboards for computers? !! Now if I can find a webtv-plus box to replace the one that fell over and died. The last person who advertized a plus-box sent me a classic box. Bummer! Anyone gotta plus box cheap?"
3,Great Debut,"This CD is a testament to the fact that Mary Cutrufello grew up idolizing Bruce Springsteen. Her own tales of bluecollar blues and love gone wrong would make The Boss proud. Cutrufello is an excellent lyricist and guitar player but her voice (in my opinion) leaves a lot to be desired. Her vocal range seems to only vacillate from grunts, to groans, to full fledged growls...a harder edge than I was expecting. But then again Cutrufello is an artist that refuses to be categorized. This is not to say that Mary's singing won't grow on you after repeated listenings, I got the impression however that Cutrufello's talents are best appreciated live in a smokey bar or pool hall."
1,No Terry Hall & Jerry Dammes = no Specials,"Like the Velvet Underground without Lou Reed, the Specials boiled down to one bloke is cabaret at best. Terry Hall was the main singer, Jerry Dammers was the direction. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along. I would urge Hall & Dammers to hire better lawyers. Why pollute a legend?"
5,"One of the best introductions to ayurveda,","I am an alternative practitioner and have been interested in ayurveda for a number of years. Out of the numerous books I have explored in the field, this has to be one of the most concise introductions. The first few chapters lay the foundation to what turned out to be a very fascinating read. The book demonstrates the importance of ayurveda in a modern lifestyle which makes it all the more relevant in this day and age. Included are numerous case studies and preactical tips. The book is well illustrated and included contact details for further information."
4,"Soulful, Baladeer, deep lyrics","Wille has always been a favorite of mine and this compilation of some of his greatest will take you on a journey along with his melodic voice.Contains many of his greatest, with the notable exception the late '70s Hutch classic ""Kelly Green""."
5,I am very excited,"[[ASIN:B0016A3R26 American English Pronunciation Patterns Network Edition + 2 Year Membership (Based on Phonics) : Perfect English Pronunciation Software to Help Improve Pronunciation, Speaking, Vocabulary, Spelling, Listening, and Reading, and Reduce Accent.]I am a ESL person with many years residing in this country and I always have been researching for different products that will help me with the pronunciation of the English language and I find this productthe best in the market because for the first time I find the software that has help me phonetically distinguish the differences in the pronunciation vowels, short and long and consonants and the patterns in the English language"
4,Pretty nice bass,"I have been playing bass for over 40 years - both electric and upright. I wanted a bass that I could practice runs on without plugging in and playing at bluegrass festivals, campfires, etc. This one fit the bill. It is a very good instrument for the money - good action, decent sound. My only additional purchase was for flat wound strings. The round wound that came with it don't give enough ""bass"" sound that I need for bluegrass. Otherwise, a really good value."
3,If only ...,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother. Great price, excellent episode selection. (And now ... the ""if only"" ...) If only the distributors would release seasons of Petticoat Junction, rather than simply an Ultimate Collection Set. Never the less, I am certain my mother will be pleased with this selection as a fan of the show for many years."
2,disappointing,"a quick read, and entertaining but doesn't really follow through on its title. very little of the book is actually about the appearance of hemophilia in victoria's line; some of it is an abbreviated story of her family, some of it is a primer on genetics, some of it is a description of family members who inherited it. but the ""hook"" that induced me to buy this book was the connection between victoria and hemophilia, and about this the book has only mild speculation. where did she get the gene? the author suggests maybe from an unknown ""real"" father; but surely such speculation is irresponsible without some evidence? of which there is none."
4,More about hemophilia and history than scandal,"It's too bad so many reviewers and editors chose to focus on the small part of this book which questions Queen Victoria's legitimacy, because that's not really what this book is about. It's far more about how the interbreeding of British and other European royalty had profound consequences for world history. The bulk of the book traces the competitive sexual politics prior to Victoria's birth, and the way inbreeding among royalty contributed to the spread of the hemophilia gene, causing major world upheaval (in particular, to the fall of the Russian tsar). Much has been written of the privileges of 19th century royalty, but this book brings into sharper focus the way these royals' private behavior had public consequences. An interesting treatise on an aspect of history that is often overlooked: that many European wars were family conflicts extended to a grand scale."
2,"a hipster collector piece, not much more","Observations:1) DVD obviously copied from a VHS or other low quality medium, with occasional tracking problems.2) Buddy Mix has a Ziggy Stardust hair cut.3) The two main portions of this DVD are nearly identical. Singing for Girls is just Singing for Guys but a different octave. Not much talk about the different theories behind each.4) The last section is a cheesy music video from the 80's of pure Buddy Mix propaganda.5) I would have liked a discussion on the soft palate.Conclusion:Excellent for getting your friends together and having a sing along / comedy hour. Wouldn't agree that it is the ""complete how to sing"" dvd... maybe some good pointers that could be worth paying less than $20."
3,A good starting point,"I don't see this becoming a classic. It has the appearance of a documentary made by a high school student with their parents' video camera. That being said, there is a lot of information about the ghostly happenings around the inland seas told by Great Lakes historians who do a good job in telling the stories; no stuttering or redundancies - though occasionally two people in a row tell the same story. The witnesses aren't quite as good, but they still manage a good yarn."
1,When does it begin being funny?,"Horrible horrible show, Cleveland just is not that amusing to get his own spin off, and the supporing cast are at best lame, especially Rollo. I can't believe this show is still on."
5,This show is HILARIOUS!!!!!!!! Cleveland rocks!,"The cast of characters on this show are just too funny! From Cleveland & Cleveland Jr, Rallo, Roberta & Donna to Lester & Kendra, Holt, Federline Jones.... and one of my favorites, the bartender Gus! What will they think of next? Great Voice casting, writing & production value make this one of my favorite shows! Keep up the great work!"
5,Pulverizing!,"Stand back Martha and let the fur fly! To be brutally honest my feeling is most of PT's work goes over the heads of most listeners. If you're willing and have the capacity for it, this work is a treasured masterpiece. The tunes are long, but well worth it. Another reviewer noted that Porcupine Tree is the best prog-group out there. You'll get no argument from me. Porcupine Tree is NO stoner garage band dedicated to serenading garage door openers, and cheap beer. This band is solid, intelligent and focused. Buy this CD. You (yes, YOU) deserve it."
3,Usually good though hardly great,"These guys have been pretty consistent in offering long doses of space-prog-rock from early studio discs onward, but have rarely offered stronger dosages of hard musical consistency amongst so many of these lengthy excursions."
2,Not worth the money,Does not add a great deal of information that is particularly valuable if one is interested in instructing students about the Freedom Writers Project. I would not recommend it.
5,Trying To Understand Cleo,"I like Cleo because she doesn't settle for the role that society has laid out for her, as a black woman(maid, etc.). Neither does she except it for anyone in her family. She strives to know the best people, improve her vocabulary, etc. However, she does this at the expense of losing her husband and possibly her daughter. This is the main drawback. Moreover, she believes in family. But, she expects those around her to allow her complete control. Even to the point of breaking up marriages that may or may not be in trouble. And, separating children from fathers."
4,Great Tool,Lots of great information inside. Great to use when trying to create different types of forms and documents.
2,Pop's Rock.,"This Canadian band changed their sound since their firstalbum.The sound is now slick and over-produced pop. Made forCanadian radio sound. And it's a shame. There seems to be suchpotential for this unit to become so much more, but it seems thatcreating a more commerical sound was the route they opted for.Thesad songs (about half of them) this band spins out make one wonder iftheir is any happiness in their world. The majority of this CD is slowmellow wish-you-were-here type ballads like the singleApparitions. Very moody and bleak.The more upbeat songs(Everything is Automatic, which sounds a lot like 54-40) are aboutbeing proud to be a misfit in suburban society. There are one or twocatchy tunes ... that even the most tone deaf person could tap a toeto. Good as filler, but nothing substantial enough to leave a lastingimpression."
5,Light Switch,This works exactly as described. We used it in a nursery to control the lights. You just have to make sure to turn it off as it requires a little extra push to make sure the light is off and not just dimmed.
4,Tight song,I don't care for Memphis Bleek all that much but this song is pretty tight. I like Twista's verse especially. Check it out!
3,Review of book about LL Bean by a native Mainiac.,"This is an interesting book,though the writer didn't appear to have access to enough information about LL Bean.I found the book repetitious at times."
4,Hmm,"Bought for a friend, came very fast through the mail. I think she probably likes it, it was simple enough"
2,Warning: This is 'easy' sheet music,"Just a caveat. This work is not correctly labeled. If you want the Easy Piano music, then I'm sure this is great.After I received it, I realized that the cover pic does show the 'easy' label, but is too small to be legible unless you know what you are looking for. The write up does not indicate the 'easy' specification.So, my low rating is for the mislabeling. And the fact that the mistake was not evident until I received my order caused problems with gifts."
2,Very Pretty - Not So Helpful,"Sigh... Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts. Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line. This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing. So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score). The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features ""Think of Me"" and ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" in their original form. For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about. So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out."
5,Awesome Album,"If you are looking for a some great music, go no further. Stephen Simmonds is awesome.I heard Stephen Simmmond's album back in Europe in 1998 when his ""Get Down"" single was released. It even got some radio playback in Asia where I was working. A great track with great hooks. That got me hooked. Got the rest of the European album, and have been happy everytime I put it in the car cd. I surely thought that EMI would have him release in the US urban market, but 2 long years later, I see that he is here. It is great to find that Priority Records has worked hard to release this gem of an album. His album is definitely due for some great exposure in the USA as he belongs in this scene.If you like D'angelo, Maxwell, and others in the new R&B/Soul category, you have to try this album out. From back to front, on shuffle or straight through, this CD will not disappoint."
1,Hmmmm...,"I purchased this cd based on people saying how ""great"" it is, and I'm not feeling this one. There are more ""misses"" than ""hits"". There are no comparisons that I draw on like previous reviews before mine. I did sell this cd to someone who apparently thinks its best thing they've ever heard. Personally, I feel Mr Simmonds and company still have their work cut out for them."
5,Freud router,The single flute cuts smooth in all types on wood. This router never got hot enough to burn the wood and left almost no tearout
3,Not Bad! But not that good!,Good album but not great. Some very good songs where you can see clearly Ric Ocasek's touch like the phenomenal tiltle track but overall not as consistent as it could be. Some enjoyable songs nontheless.
1,Doesn't fit my Eljer toilet,"This is the second flapper I've purchased that specifically says it fits Eljer toilets, but doesn't. Pretty disappointing. At this point I think we are going to have to remove the entire toilet and replace it, just because we can't find a flapper that fits. Pretty ridiculous. Will certainly not be replacing it with another Eljer toilet."
4,I loved the focus on Parker,"This is the second book in this series that I have read. I loved the first one I read, Ancient Ones, but felt that the relationship between Turnipseed and Parker was the weakest part of the book. I was surprised and pleased about the lack of Anna in Dance of the Thunder Dogs.Dance of the Thunder Dogs is full of exciting action and I especially appreciate the fact that I didn't figure out how it was all going to end by the time I was half-way through the book."
1,a half of a pair is nothing`,"This book is a waste. I have been waiting to read it for six months but when it arrives I find that half the book is missing.Emmett Parker without Anna Turnipseed is nothing. The relationship between the two is what makes the previous stories work. This is just another who-done-it ala the ""Fugitive"" and as such, a waste of time and money."
5,Brilliant,"One of the worst movies ever made was ""Fool for Love."" Oddly enough, the film's soundtrack, by Sandy Rogers, was brilliant. ""Green Moon,"" lo these many years later, is of the same caliber: distinctive voice, great songs, strong lyrics. I have only two quibbles: first, the CD, with just ten songs, is too short; second, I can't find a CD of ""Fool for Love""--and I don't even own a turntable any longer, so I am left to barely remember that gem."
4,Just the book I wanted!,Hatha Yoga IllustratedGreat book and shows all the poses in detail and benefits from each pose. Great book for beginners like myself.A must if you are taking Yoga!
4,Good overall especially for noobs,"Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha/2008 Fourth Revised EditionThe illustrations and explanations are quite good. However they used pictures of actual people which may be distracting to some. The authors of this book made a concerted effort dilute some source data in order to appease the new age crowd. It is certain and most true that Yoga is a practice which has its roots in Hindu Esoteric Practicum. Hatha Yoga is about cleansing the gross physical body in order to enliven the Atman, which is another thing the authors left out. A much better book that I strongly recommend is ""Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha by Swami Satyananda Saraswati"". That book has all the Asanas, a progressive course on gradual practices, internal mechanics of Pranayama, as well as clear and concise explanations without the use photos in their stead anatomic illustrations. Hope this was helpful, Namas Te everyone!"
3,Durable,"As far as construction and materials, this is a well made product. It's heavy and doesn't ""walk"" when you use it. The marble on the INSIDE wells is a bit rough...maybe that's for a reason, but it feels weird when you pinch out some salt or pepper and scrape the bottom. Also, this is not airtight so if you live in high humidity it might not be the choice for you. This product may have deserved a higher rating from me...I guess I'm not that crazy about the way it looks on my counter and sorry I didn't go with a wooden one."
5,jazz...jail...god...,the hippest trip around...this book will grab you by the soul and spin you around. reading it changed my life.
5,A SWEEEEEEEET GAME,"This game throws in stuff from GTA Vice City, State Of Emergency,and GTA3. You have so many things to do in this game it isnt even funny. it will keep you playin until the next time patrick fontenot will get a 100 on a math test. which is never!"
5,"Finally, True Crime for the Gamecube","True Crime SOL is the game thatGamecube owners have been waitingfor and it's here. The controls are tight and the graphics are amazing, better than the PS2. This game has driving, shooting,fighting, do anything you want mayhem, all in one. You cruise through the streets of L.A., busting bad guys and doing whatever you want.The only bad thing about this game is that you can't play at night, but other than that, TrueCrime SOL is one must-have game for the GCN. If you buy your gameat Target, ask for a coupon that you can reedem for a free strategy guide."
5,beautifully ecclectic,"this album is truly amazing...i love how she incorporates folk, rock, hip hop and a kind of traditional, celtic-y sense of the natural world. the lyrics are truly lovely and some of the faster songs are catchy without being simple-minded---she really is a a gifted poet and all the songs reflect that (and i particularly love ""whether or not"" and ""Diving to be deeper"")"
3,Decent background music,"The CD is ""nice"" but sounds like it was restrained by the record label within Americanized boundaries. This Sinead sounds like she's about to start singing any minute, but never quite does. Nice coffee house music. Ms. Lohan will be coming thru my city in a few weeks. I look forward to the show to see if there's anything there which wasn't on the CD. I suspect there is."
1,Another Rip Off!!!!,"Just like everyone else, I expected Tony Jaa to be the highlight of this film. He is not! He has a short cameo performing awesome stunts, but it only lasts about 4-5 minutes. These companies know how to make a quick buck on an actor that may be in a prestigous class now, but back then they were working to make a name for themselves. Don't buy it not only because Jaa is barely in it, but because it absolutely stinks up the room! Horrible to the third power folks!!!"
3,Think twice!,"I love all genre of martial arts, after seeing Tony in the Protector 1 and 2, saw this, but it is a remake of way earlier career. Thought it was slow, and not up to todays remake standards."
2,Spirited Killer,"It was probably fascinating in its day but based on today's standards, it is pretty old fashioned."
3,odd,"Poor ole Bach. Sax choirs, Swingle singers. Synths and Bongos.. well at least the clavichord predates the light bulb.Don't get me wrong this is not a wretched CD. I even play it ... sometimes. It may not be `whatever' but the artiste Maybe he had a hot date or the Celtic Gaol Squad was after him something but he just plays the music too fast for me. The playing sounds rushed [which one doesn't `pick up' on the samples]. I wouldn't want to see a comparison of this and, say, Glen Gould playing Bach on the piano in terms of tempi.This is a nice `specimen' CD IF you already own a CD of these works."
5,Great Blade,"Cuts like butter, leaves a smooth finished edge, and doesn't pull itself in because of the negative hook design."
1,A VERY BORING ADVENTURE FLICK,"BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE IS THE WORST ACTION PICTURE I'VE EVER SEEN. MICHEAL CAINE, TELLY SEVALLAS, SALLY FIELDS AND SLIM PICKENS GIVE THIER WORST ACTING PERFORMANCES IN THIS FILM. THIS MOVIE IS EVEN WORSE THAN GODZILLA OF 1998 AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS IT'LL LULL YOU TO SLEEP LIKE IT DID ME."
4,Another winner,"Shorter, and perhaps not as good as their ""Court Of The Lion"", I still enjoyed this novel and the duo's style of writing."
2,Too much twisting of historical facts,"The book twisted a lot of facts regarding Empress Wu. Although a novel, as it depicts a historical figure, a more balanced account should have been given. For example, it is not clear that she killed her own daughter and her mother neither wielded such strong influence nor lived so long."
2,Very poorly organized,"This is a very poorly put together book. It's organized as a series of small articles, but the article sizes vary widely and many of them contradict others. ...It definately has some useful information in there, but it's tough to extract through the poor organization and formatting."
3,sheepskin covers,"The wool pile in one seat was thinner than the other seat. there is also an inconsistency within the wool pile of one seat. On the positive side, they fit well for a bmw 5 series and the delivery time was fast."
3,Old Green Bay,"A brief history of Green Bay,Navarino and Fort Howard. More of a who's who of what was. From the lighthouse base on LongTail Point, to old Green Bay to DePere. With pictures it clocks in at fourty nine pages long. Too short for any in-depth knowledge, and just long enough to make you consider a day trip to either White Pillars in DePere, Hazelwood in Green Bay or better yet the Neville Museum in downtown Green Bay. If you have the time you might want to take in Heritage Hill, in Allouez."
3,It's ok,"As en psychic empath,I can tell you that this book is ok. She has some good points,and some corrections of ESP. But she use too highly educated grammar/words that can confuse the average reader. And she is misleading in her religious beliefs,too focused on forcing her religion onto a reader who is looking for wisdom of their psychic ablities. Which is wrong for any religous person or psychic."
3,"Do what he says here, not what he did in his other books...","I found the book (I am about halfway through it) to be a good read, loaded with useful Bible text. However, with the case of Wade, do what he says, not what he did. I went to check his website out, and he filed for bankruptcy.His insight into gleening is very useful though."
2,47 Notebooks written in Italian; very few drawings,"Make sure that this is what you are looking for! I had thought there would be significantly more drawings -- there aren't. This set is a beautiful facsimile of 47 of the tiny notebooks Aldo Rossi carried for much of his life. These notebooks are handwritten, in Italian, and do not contain more than a dozen or so drawings. If you are looking for his drawings, look elsewhere. If you read fluent Italian and don't mind spending $600.00 for a peek into Rossi's thought process, then this is for you."
5,Great value for the price!,"I needed a simple wireless headphone and got this for a great price. I just needed something to use when watching tv late at night so that I don't disturb others. Works great for tv use. You just simply plug the base unit into the tv's headphone jack, plug the cord into the outlet and you're ready to go. I can watch tv from across the room and go to another area of the room and still listen to what's going on. It's got a decent range. I got the Sennheiser wireless for the stereo in the living room. I use these for the bedroom tv and it does the job. I had to pay a lot for the Sennheiser and I wasn't going to pay a lot just to use it for the tv. I highly recommend it."
3,OK,hi im a kid and this is what i think of this game. I dont really know about this game the story is very hard to follow and its very easy to get lost. anyway it is kind of fun but not as fun as other original xbox games.
2,Disappointed,"The reason the first game was so great was because of the story, this game's story is lacking and I found the boss battles to be far too easy."
4,You guys are expected way too much.,"This game is a great game.... The gameplay is much better than the first and the features are alot better than the first. The graphics have been boosted a tad bit, the replay value is very impressive. The character development is not better than the first, it is different but just as powerful, the ability to influence your partners into becoming Jedi is pretty damn cool. Also the item costumizability is very diverse.On the con side. The frame-rate slowdowns are quite annoying but they rarely occur. The story line seems a bit iffy, i mean it is a really good story line, but it doesnt seem whole, the endings dont seem complete at all. At some points during the game you are forced to use characters from your party with the absense of the main character and if you dont know to manage your characters well, those parts get inmensely difficult."
1,"I LOVE KOTOR, the original. I HATE KOTOR II. LAME GAME!","I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GIVE ZERO STARS. The original game is wonderful; relationships are built slowly with interesting banter that ranges from dramatic to romantic. The violence is what it is, but you have a choice whether to venture to the dark side or not.KOTOR II is very dark, lacks substance. Nothing likeable about any of the characters. Starts slowly, moves very quickly and aside from the invisible duelist, is quite easy to beat. 9 hours, give or take a few for cereal breaks, but this game really stinks.FOR A SEQUAL, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO CHOOSE AT THE BEGINNING WHETHER REVAN WAS LIGHT OR DARK AND SET UP YOUR CHARACTER THAT WAY. OR EVEN HAD A WAY TO READ FROM YOUR SAVED GAMES FROM KOTOR 1. THIS WAS A RIP OFF, LAME EXCUSE FOR A SEQUAL. LAME. LAME. LAME. LAME. LAME. SORRY, FOLKS, THIS GAME IS LAME."
5,Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords,I was very happy with the with the product and the speed at which I had received it. I would purchase or recommend from this person in the future. Thanks for all your assistance.
2,"Too little, too late","I am surprised that this edition was allowed to be so widely distributed....many forms in the back were overprinted with the annotation ""draft, do not use."" This year's version lacked the usual crispness of prior years versions. If I had known how good TurboTax was this year I would never have purchased Ernst & Young guide!"
3,Didn't find any difference from the regular Maxell cdr's,I don't understand what's so great about these high priced cdr's. I bought a pack and burned some cd audio and it sounds the exact same. The cd looks the exact same. I tried my hardest to figure out what the difference is between these and the 10 pack of Maxell CD's also sold at Amazon.Com for 16.99! I say just buy the 10 pack and leave these high priced similar cdr's alone.
5,Perfect hands-free flashlight,"this is my second favorite flashlight ever. my favorite is also made by coast cutlery, it has the same power-chip in a hand-held. very bright, hours and hours of usage on one set of batteries, very comfortable, great for construction work (crawl spaces, working into the evening), close work with computer hardware, you name it. essential."
2,Sprung a leak,I bought this kettle less than a year ago. It started leaking recently and I have to replace it - with a different kettle.
1,Not as good as we hoped,As one of the more expensive kettles we hoped this might be better quality. It has a terrible messy pour. Bad design. Shame as it looks so nice! Would not recommend this kettle to future buyer despite sleek looks.
4,Boils water like it's supposed to,"Boils water like a boss.Only 4 stars because the pour spout isn't as accurate as I'd like, and when/if limescale starts to build up, I'm probably going to have to make sure it remains clean, as I'm not sure the filter creates a great seal that all the water goes through."
3,great but the lid is plastic,"I bought this after searching for a no plastic interior. I like the stainless steel, style and wide lid opening however the underside of the lid is plastic. I removed the strainer immediately. The water smelled of heated plastic after many heatings even though the boiling water does not touch it, the steam and heat does. So now I am using a metal saucer as a lid in its place. Because the saucer fits snuggly, the kettle does shut off automatically where other lids that I improvised from the kitchen did not. For health reasons I would NOT buy this kettle again. Easy to clean and fill. The pop open lid was great to use, if only it was not lined with plastic. I was willing to pay more for an all stainless steel, healthier product."
5,great product!!,I bought this for my sister a few months ago and she loves it!I Highly recommend this electric kettle.
2,Loved it until it started leaking,I had this kettle for exactly one year when it started leaking at the base next to the switch. I loved it until then.
4,good electric kettle,"I bought this kettle after reading other customer reviews. I like the seamless design and it boils water very quickly. The only negative is the flip top design which is a little screwy but once you get used to it, is no problem at all. We use it at least twice every day and are very happy with it."
5,nice kettle,this boils water SO fast. especially nice because the inside is seamless stainless steel. no plastic-y chemicals lurching into water here..
3,Could be better.,"The body of the kettle is fully stainless steel, but not the lid which is plastic and has a slight ""modern plastic"" smell when hot. My biggest complain is the consistent dripping from the spout when pouring. The shape of the spout needs to be improved. The real capacity is 1.2 Liter. It is not the most powerful kettle, so it takes some time to boil 1 liter of water, but it is not noisy. There is no automatic shut-off when lifting the kettle from its base, but this feature is not common in the USA."
2,Worst design ever for lid and spout,I could not imagine such a terrible design for the lid and spout. It's way too hard to fill the kettle via the spout since it is so tiny (you would have to use a funnel). Filling it after pushing the button to open the lid results in the lid opening downwards into the kettle so you can't fill it more than half full.
3,Good while it lasted,Pro: Cannot burn you. Not cool by touch but not super hot either. Heat the water pretty fast.Con: Lid design is not well thought off. Doesn't open up. Instead front part goes up while back goes down. So it's not convenient to put the water in. Also gave up after 2 years of light use. I'm not buying it anymore.
4,Works quickly & well.,"Works quickly & well, cool to the touch as claimed. Can make large or small quantities of boiling water. Initially a bit difficult to understand how to put on the lid,you need to read their instructions - it is not obvious.When I got the kettle I measured the water and noted placement of the water.So I did not look for a measurement marker inside the kettle.There is a sound of rolling water when it starts to boil, it lasts seconds, should not disturb any but those hyper sensitive to noise."
1,Can't pour without dribbling!,"On the bright side, this product is stainless steel, no plastic inside, & electric.The problem with this kettle is that it dribbles all down the machine and onto the floor (and your shoes) no matter how fast or slow you try to pour due to a terrible spout. AWFUL. The problem is that the spout area is thick and wide. Usually spouts are very thin and come to an edge. Think of it as the difference between water shooting off a gutter vs. spilling over a bathtub. This is just bad design. I returned it after trying to deal with it for 2 weeks. Gave it a good chance!"
3,Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Kettle,"Pros:Great design:It is cool to the touch and attractive on the counter.Cons:Poor engineering:It boils water longer than I'd like before it shuts off (not electrically efficient).It's almost impossible to pour out water without it pouring all over. I need to pour over the sink. I just discovered that if you pour really SLOWLY, you can get most of the water into the cup and not on the counter."
5,Superb,"This is just about the ideal for an electric kettle. I brought mine to work in order to make tea. Three of my coworkers have since purchased this pot because they love it so much. My favorite part is the cool-touch aspect. It's a feature that you may not really think about but it's invaluable around the young, old, or clumsy. Definitely worth the price."
3,Does the job -- very little plastic,"I chose this one because it has very little plastic -- body is all steel. The lid has some plastic parts lining the inside (why?!) so I took it off and use it without the lid. The downside is that with the lid off, it will not shut off when it reaches boiling. Also, it is NOT 8 cups -- 40 ounces is correct. If you're only boiling for one or two 12- or 16-oz mugs, it's fine."
2,Not Impressed,"I had a number of complaints right after receiving the product.For starters, it claims to hold 8 cups.Yet, when filled to the ""max"" line i found the kettle to only hold 4 cups. I then placed it on the counter near a 40 cup percolator and was surprised to find that it was more than half the percolator's size. It is a tremendously bulky kettle for such a small volume capacity. And while it does remain cool to the touch and is all steel, there is no water level indicator that i could find and the lid was quarky to use. Its size also made it hard to fill unless you have a deep sink.The only thing i found going for this kettle was the fact that there was no plastic... unless you count the lid and the built in filter.To summarize, the bulkiness and lack of water capacity offset this all metal kettle."
4,pain relief,"This product is easy to use - I just mix it with a tablespoon of Whiskas catmilk - and it seems to be providing relief for a fat old cat. He is moving much better, which will help with his diet and exercise program."
5,wife and teen daughter liked it,"1 player game that my wife & teen daughter have played more than any of our other PS2 games.I thought it was too much motorocycle driving and not enought motorocycle building. You have to complete missions/chapters to be able to work on building your bike, part by part.I was disappointed to see it was made by Russian programmers. Come on, the name is AMERICAN choppers."
5,mythraljrratesem,this game rocks for all ages. Those fans that watch the show on discovery will like the detail of the personallities of everyone. You must check it out.
1,Disappointed this game is UNAmerican,"Initially the game appeared fun. Then I looked at the credits. The game was made by Russian/German/Czech? individuals. Aside from the first few credits of executive producers and such, the rest of the game was apparently outsourced to foreign workers. Dont take my word for it, borrow someone's game, or rent it before buying it. The credits section is the most UNAmerican game I have seen yet. I wish I hadn't wasted money on this. Maybe I am too patriotic, but American Chopper video game made by foreign workers, I should've seen it coming."
3,Love the radio show - this is a bit of a rehash,"I've always enjoyed This American Life on the radio and use the iPhone app to listen to episodes on car trips. I've giving the tv version a 3 out 5 not because its bad, but just because its redundant unless you just have to have a face to go with names. The stories on this show have already been featured in the radio version with little if any addition. There are occasional flourishes (an animated segment!) and I guess it could be fun to see where Ira Glass' desk will show up next, but I think the video actually takes a little away from the show. I think there's a reason it only last two seasons."
3,good but no CD,Good job the book was as described. The book arrived at the time expected; the only thing I didn't find any CD.
1,"A good idea, but poorly realized","The general idea behind the TC-1000 is a good one, but the product itself is much more trouble than it's worth. The unit is exceptionally annoying unless you invest a good deal of time in custom programming, and the software would try the patience of a saint. My TC-1000 was gathering dust for many months before I finally found the Philips Pronto, which is all that the TC-1000 ought to be (and a little more)."
3,Leadership When the Heats on,"After reading the book Leadership When the Heat Is on, I have found a new admiration of the people who move towards the field of leadership and being a leader. The writer, Danny Cox basically wrote about his experiences in the field of becoming a leader to a group of people in the sales process. The writer mentions problems on how and why these problems came about. The book over all is about common sense in the viewpoint of a person who has experienced it first hand. This book was something that people should read to grasp a better idea of what to expect out of a person who is responsible for others below them in a business setting. The people who are having troubles in getting to know the people that they work with and to get those people to work should read this book."
4,M.C. Wright = Wrong,"Do not listen to M.C. Wright. His point about Vagrant buying up smaller labeled bands is justified. But, that is business. Vagrant is a mid grade label, just like victory. Just because Emanuel signed to this label does not make them bad. In fact, they are very good. Although they are not entirely original, they also are not ripping anybody off. It is just plain good music. They bring their own style of energy to their music. I like to say they sound like the perfect blend between Letter Kills and the Bronx. These guys do have a sound that could POSSIBLY put them on Mtv, but so what. Just because a band is played on mainstream radio or Mtv does not mean they suck. Most of the bands they are played with DO suck, but not all mainstream sucks. Nirvana, Sublime, Alice In Chains were all way more mainstream than anyting I can think of right now and nobody can dispute how awesome they all are. Emanuel is just good music, stop whining."
5,good and informative,"i bought this for my fiance. we are long distance and planning the wedding from a few countries away, so i thought that since he is a captive audience downrange i could send him any reading material i thought appropriate. i read this before i sent it to him, and i pretty much liked everything.i hope that he reads it with an open mind. .. . . . right now he is thinking about having his manly man play and drinkfest with his friends the night prior to the wedding, and now he can read it in a book (instead of just me) of why that isn't a good idea. (wanna know what it says to do the night before? SLEEP.)anyway, i think it will give perspective and let him think about a few things that otherwise could not be imagined. so many details and decisions!!!"
1,Turn off the Racket!,"I saw an advertisement for this album in Spin Magazine. The album's striking cover art caught my attention immediately, and I am a little ashamed to admit that this was the main reason why I bought the album the day it came out.The music is basically a rehash (both musically and lyrically) of every other scream-a-toria album ever to come out. And while it is evident that the band has instrumental potential, their abysmal songwriting makes the album just that much more disappointing."
2,This is truly fiction,"Although the author does a fairly good job at creating the characters. The story line is to far off and contrived. It is just way to unbelievable. At one point I wanted to stop because the ""cringe"" factor was so high. The end was also very predictable. It was not the worst book I have read, but it was certainly not great."
2,GOOD IDEA BUT POOR FITTING PARTS,The adapter is a great idea for playing VHS-C tapes in your regular VCR but mine stuck in the VCR every time I used it. All regular VCR tapes worked fine. It needs some refining
1,Requested a 8MM to VHS adapter and recieved - RCA VCA115 VHS-C Cassette Adapter,Requested an 8MM to VHS adapter and received the RCA VCA115 VHS-C Cassette Adapter that is not the same and does not fit a 8MM?!
1,Super NO,"Haven't noticed a difference yet. Should have expected that. I don't smoke, drink coffee, or wine. Don't buy, just go get your teeth done by a professional. Once you waste all the money on these pastes and white strips and bla bla bla you could have just had a dentist do them."
1,"Plainly, it just doesn't work!",So I bought the whole system and used it for about a month and a half...I later asked my friend if she sees a difference and she says they look more yellow. Before she made that comment I had noticed how it wasn't effective at all. I just thought it was all in my head. Don't use this system..I felt like my teeth did not get any cleaner after brushing patiently. I honestly got teeth that got more yellow..I followed directions perfectly. I used it only on a dry toothbrush. I always wet my toothbrush before applying toothpaste and so I bought an extra toothbrush just in case I make that mistake I would have a dry spare. I spent at least 7 minutes brushing. I just did it all man! and it didn't work...period. Drugstore brands do more for my teeth than this crap. I wasted my money...
2,Don't see a difference,"I read the reviews before buying this product and it looked very positive. However, after 3 weeks of using it twice a day, I don't really see a difference at all."
2,So disappointed,"I must say I am so very disappointed in the Supersmile Whitening System Set - 3.6 & 4.2 Oz each. I have used both faithfully, exactly as stated in the directions. I just completed using the entire contents. I took a before & after picture, and see no difference after completion of products. Not only did I use exactly as directed, I also brushed my teeth for twice as long as recommended, and at times, 3 times a day. My husband & son said they see no difference what-so-ever. For the price of these 'toothpaste'. I expected at least some good results. I'll return to my dentists' whitening gel. Wish I had something better to say."
1,Sorry I Fell For It,"I should have read all the reviews before reading. Sorry SSW System, the paste alone does not work. Perhaps Amazon should not carry it."
1,Very disappointing.,"I echo many of the sentiments in the 1 and 2 star reviews. This is one of the 3 or 4 books in my lifetime that I have laid down in the middle and will not pick up again. I am a 67 year old woman and find the world described here beyond belief. The writing is dull and the plot is, uh, plodding. Enough said."
5,The Kill - Allison Brennan,"Allison Brennan is great, I think I have read all of her books now. The trilogies are great. You feel so connected to the characters. Her books catch my interest from page 1 & the suspense/romance keeps me reading. Hard to put the book down."
2,Great storyline but amateurish writing at best,"The storyline for this book was excellent as you can see from some of the other reviews so I won't explain it again. The thing that bothered me about the book was the dialogue. I found that the characters were saying things out of the ordinary for the TNG crew we all know. For instance, Captain Picard asks Data if a Jeffries Tube leads to the bridge. Can anyone tell my why he would even have had to ask that??? Captain Picard would have already known that, I know I did! Also the writing is not very descriptive or detailed. The only reason I finished it is because I wanted to find out how Wesley rejoined Starfleet. If you want to fill in the gaps between Wesley's departure from TNG and his return to Starfleet I suggest you read the book, otherwise don't waste your time."
4,Local Boys Make Good,"This release took a bit of work to find but definitely didnt dissappoint. The chill smoothed out beats provide a sweet background for the tight lyrics reminicscent of others like Outkast, and Digable Planets. The undergound scene is strong on the shoulders the those like the OUtfit and Jurassic 5"
2,"Poorly Made, but Beautiful",We bought this music box for our 7 year old daughter for Christmas. She loved it and was really enjoying it. That afternoon she went to wind it up and the mechanism broke. I wouldn't buy another one because it's not worth the money.
3,"Fine, but no different from refill","This scratching board is fine, but you might as well buy a refill if you can find it cheaper because the cardboard holder doesn't do anything for it. In fact, the holder will just make it slide around more, so you really have to take it out. Our cats haven't used it at all yet, but our vet said her cats really tear them up. I guess not every cat will like it."
5,"Solid, Economical Performance.","Purchased this unit for small business duty as it was the cheapest way to get into binding (vs coil, thermal, velobind, tape, GBC Proclick) and worked with very inexpensive disposables. While this unit is obviously not suited to high volume work: 9-pages per punch (really more like 7) means far too many steps to create a large binding. It is fully functional, easy to use, and has proved quite durable (despite feeling somewhat lighter and more fragile than expected) -- having survived weeks of use by temps and my own ham-handed efforts. While this is an inexpensive machine (mostly plastic and light enough to require a steadying hand when punching more than two or three pages)it has obviously been designed with actual use in mind. Highly recommended for the cost conscious."
5,"Great boot, definitely worth the purchase","They're comfortable and durable, and were relatively quick to break in (I wore them to work for two 8-hour shifts, and they were broken in by the end of the second). The double zip means that I don't have to take the time to re-tie them every time. The insole is actually shaped to fit your foot, unlike a lot of boots with a plain, flat insole. I've got wide-ish feet, and they still fit nicely. And they polish up all nice and shiny :P I've had them for a few months now, and haven't once regretted the purchase. Great heavy-duty work and motorcycle-riding boots."
5,ASHLIEGH AND WONDER A WONDERFUL STORY,This is the book that started me reading and collecting all the books in the Thoroughbred series. I have read this book atleast 5 times. All my books take up 2 rows in my book self. I know how it feels to lose horses with my farm. Anyone will feel great by this book
5,Terrific!!!!,This was truly an amazing book. Ashleigh dose not know how luck she is to live on a big farm like that. It was incuaging to know that even though no one would belive in Wonder she still had the courage to show them. I love this book and the whole series.
5,The BEST!!!!! 5 stars aren't enough!!!!!!!!!,Asleigh loves the colt and she helps it live.This is one of my favorite books in the Thoroughbred series. JoAnna Campbell you're great. -Betsy
2,WATCH OUT!,"Before you buy this, notice that although it's deceptively called ""36 capacity cassette tape case"" it actually only holds 30 boxed tapes! It will hold 36 cassette singles, which (obviously) you don't own, or 36 tapes removed from their boxes, which you also aren't going to do, because if you did, you'd have no way of knowing which tape was which without pulling them all out! So go ahead and buy this carrying case if you want, it's a perfectly fine case, but it ain't gonna hold 36 tapes!"
2,too small. perfect for a one smoker home...not more,for some reason you have to sort of push the cigarette in. the hole isn't big enough for it to slide smoothly. i usually keep it with some water in it because it won't put out the cigarettes immediately.
4,I still have it,I purchased this awhile ago and use it in my golf cart & my car. It's very good quality. I recommend it for anyone who needs a portable butt bucket. Even good to use on my patio.
3,Table/Chair color are mismatch,"The table is one color (gold oak) and the chairs are another (brown oak), but I love the ease of putting it together. Fits great in my small kitchen dining area."
4,Lyle,"While nothing can compare to watching Lyle in concert, this is still a fun album to listen to. Filled with some of Lyle's biggest hits, this disc shows why he is one of America's great songmen. Great for any fan of Lyle or true American Country Music."
3,"3 for fans, 5 for newbies","Don't misread my intentions in the summary... I'm a true fan; however, this CD is meant for two types of people: those who were at the shows where it was recorded, and those who want an introduction to his work (or maybe for completists, but 13 of the 14 songs are available on his studio albums). Unfortunately, the mood on several of the songs is somewhat lackluster and rushed. They don't stand up well to their studio versions, with one exception:I have to give Lovett applause for his live version of ""You Can't Resist It"" - for the past several years, he's developed this tune, one of his less-notable studio cuts, into a wonderful piece of work. I went from skipping this song on his first CD to cheering it at his concerts.Lyle, you're the man."
4,A solid if overlooked album,"""Money and Cigarettes"" is not one of Eric Clapton's better remembered albums, but that's not because it isn't any good. It ranks somewhere in the second tier of Clapton albums behind classics like ""461 Ocean Boulevard"" and ""Layla"" but well ahead of some of his lesser efforts. The best songs here include the easy rockin' ""I've Got a Rock'n'Roll Heart,"" ""Pretty Girl,"" and ""Slow Down Linda."" The album is also one of Clapton's more bluesy, which perhaps accounts in part for its lack of popularity. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile listen for Clapton fans."
2,Low period for God.,"Most of these songs just sound like they've thrown together some last minute weak major to minor chord progressions. Clapton seems to be going through the motions. Apart from the Sleepy John Estes track ""Everybody ought to change"" there's nothing inspirational. Eric's version of ""Crosscut Saw"" is adequate but he repeats just one predictable Albert King phrase throughout. My goodness, even Albert, who was always accused of using three licks, was more adventurous than someone who was bestowed with the title ""GOD"". ""Slow Down Linda"" and ""Man In Love"" sound more like Chas 'n"" Dave songs and Eric was still influenced by that duo.Skip this one and move on to another earlier Clapton album or better still listen to him with ""Cream""."
3,Three good songs only -- but they are very good,"I recommend this album on the strength of three very good tracks: The Shape I'm In (a laid-back rocker that actually works for a change, and boasts some stinging guitar solos); Ain't Goin' Down (first time he had sounded like Derek and the Dominoes in a long, long time); and Crosscut Saw (classic Clapton blues rock). Unlike the ""professional"" review Amazon opens up with, I would totally disagree that the hit, ""Rock'n'Roll Heart,"" ""sums up this album."" That's the worst track on it. Sad to say, but for me, this was the best of a very dismal, long string solo Clapton albums going back to Ocean Blvd."
5,"Heart-rending, cool, and lush","Like the arcing canopy of a forest which no one sees on a chilly rainy day, on this cd, its followup to the similarly tremendous A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular, Hooverphonic has created a rending symphony of heartache, wistfulness, and icy cool which causes us to long for the unnameable. Songs like Battersea and Eden speak of places--not just geographic--to which we wished we might have gone, had we the chance. But like the past, Hooverphonic's arrangements move us far from what we recognize of ourselves once we see it, and toward a longing--as the great poet Robert Hass wrote, ""Longing, we say, because desire is full of endless distances.""Those distances we see far too clearly in this music."
3,Spinning Wheels,"Apart from the opening ""Battersea"" (which sounds like fragments of Henryk Gorecki's Third Symphony grafted onto a drum n bass meltdown), ""Renaissance Affair"", and the excellent ""Eden"" (perhaps their best song ever), this collection of songs is not as strong by half as their debut ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"". Sometimes the songs go on too long, and they have a studio-whiz indulgence to them. The production standards are amazing, of course, but I just wish there were more songs than just structures which seemed awaiting memorable melodies..."
5,among my top 10 CDs,"I discovered this band thanks to the tv commercial for a vw, which featured the song Renaissance Affair, as I found out on the adcritic.com website. Electro Shock Faders is another particularly good track. This CD is now among my favorite ones and the Amazon's recommendation also directed me to listen to Portishead and Morcheeba, which are close in style and equally good."
1,Blue Wonder Power Milk doesn`t deliver,"I was dissapointed with Blue Wonder Power Milk. The album didn`t create that dreamy ambient mood that I have been looking for since Portishead`s ""Dummy,"" Maxwell`s ""Urban Hang Suite,"" or Tricky`s ""Maxinquaye."""
3,Wasn't as good as I had hoped,"This was an album that I bought purely because of the rave reviews here (people saying if you like this group, that group and that other group, then you'll like this one). Well I was rather disappointed. It isn't a bad album which is why I gave it three stars, but no part of it really sticks in my head at all like a good album normally will. I can remember parts of Battersea, but only because it's the first track. The rest of it I tend to tune out. I guess it's good as background music, but if I could do it over again I wouldn't buy it."
1,ripped off,I ordered this item in January. Here I am in march STILL waiting for it to arive. Amazon sait it was supposed to arrive around Feb. 5th. I'm starting to think my money was stollen. Don't trust this dealer.Jim Henson's Muppet Video: Gonzo Presents Muppet Weird Stuff
2,Loud & Not Very Powerful,"It is small and un massager like looking, but it is loud and not powerful enough for someone that is used to a AC powered device."
2,Disappointed,"This book covers a huge range of Irish names, however only provides minimal information on each and coat of arms for the select few. It provided the same information that is easily found on the web."
2,Terrible Video Quality,"At least three of these old movies may have been worth the low price of this DVD set, had it not been for the terrible video quality. They look as though they were re-recorded from very old, worn out and neglected (and even abused) tapes, and lost even more quality through the use of a very cheap file type conversion program. Though some of the movies might be good, this DVD set is not worth buying, because of the quality of the video; it's TERRIBLE!!!"
4,A little more cuddle,"I really like him and he has a very realistic look to him, but his paws and beak look a bit cheap and could be a bit more cuddly."
5,Love this little platypus,he is so fin and cute and cuddly. a gretat buy and last forever! helps for people like me who want a platypus but live in the u.s ! (:
5,A Great gift for a Platapus lover.,I got this as a gift for a friend who loved Platypuses. And the detail is really great on it. It even has little plush claws. Everything is plush except for the eyes. It would have been even better if it had a more realistic tail and feet but that's only nit picking.
5,My husband thinks I'm the greatest wife for this gift.,"His brother had the drill doctor but not the attachment, so now my husband is one step ahead of the game!"
2,"Good record, but strange","What make Clapton so disturbing to the rock fan, Iit's the fact that he is the ""darling""from rock media, always winning the Grammies as ""best rock guitarrist"" (what about Satriani, Hetfield, Sambora,Blackmore, The Edge, and dozens of ohters?) and ""best rock singer"" (what about Coverdale, Gillan, Dio,Dickinson and dozens of others?). Listening to ""Behind the Sun"", you will not have the faintest clue to why this happens."
2,Too much Phil Collins obscures Clapton's rediscovery of the guitar,"One piece of credit I have to give to Phil Collins - he managed to get Clapton to play some of his best guitar work since his guest appearance on Roger Water's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking LP. Unfortunately, most of this blistering guitar work is lost under a heavy blanket of overproduction and drum machines. This might be the worst collaboration since Jeff Beck picked that awful disco remixer to produce his Flash album. Save your money and just download Forever Man rather than buying the whole album."
5,Another Pixar Masterpiece,Best movie of the year. This animated is so good and action packed you will forget it is animation and think it is a movie.It is all about 2 former superheros who marry and have kids. The father resumes his former superhero status. Soon his wife becomes a superhero again and their children become superheros as well.Great effects and sound. My son loves this movie. We espically love the action sequence when the whole family is fighting the bad guys on the island.These Pixar movies feel like they were made for us parents to enjoy just as much as the kids.Nicole M*
3,okay for the price.,"I bought this dvd used. When we attempted to play the dvd, it stopped at several points in the movie. I do not know what the testing criteria is for selling used products, but I would have assumed the dvd would be free of skipping. I didn't spend much but it was definitely a lesson learned."
3,Who wouldn't enjoy this?,"This is such a fun family movie. We have watched it a few times now. This last time my kids were 6,4,2,1, and I expected everyone to love it. However, my 4 year old was terrified of Jack-Jack at the end when he gets his powers! She had bad dreams for a few nights in a row, and wouldn't go to bed because she was afraid.My family loves this film and we will watch it again, but next time we will forward past the ending scene with Syndrome and Jack-Jack. Her tears and sleepless nights caused me to mark this down. :( Great film, I would just recommend keeping the remote handy, and paying attention to your children's faces."
1,Dumb Plot. Dumb Idea. Dumb movie!,"This is probably the only bad review for this movie here on Amazon, but...Here it goes...This movie (to me) is plane on...STUPID! It makes NO sense, it has a STUPID plot, and its STUPID, STUPID, STUPID in EVERYWAY! This is the STUPIDEST animation movie I'v EVER seen! If you are a dramatic 13-16 year-old teenager who mostly perfers good REGULAR movies that actually MAKE sense...Do NOT watch this...this...Piece of CRAP!!!"
1,This was a huge disappointment!,"I am amazed at how many people thought this was a great movie. This was THE worst Disney/Pixar film I have ever seen. The movie was extremely predictable and worst of all -- the storyline was very week. It only had a couple of moments, which were funny, the rest of the movie drug on and on. My kids liked it, but every adult I spoke with thought this movie bombed. Nothing like Pixar's other movies...like ""Nemo"" or the ""Toy Story"" series. Those were a delight to young and old alike."
4,Incredibles,I downloaded movie for our vacation and I think my grandson must have watched it aminimum of 20 times. He absolutely loved it.
3,Good.... but not 'Incredible',"Most of us have high expectations for Pixar studios after the amazing movies they have given us. When I first saw the preview for The Incredibles when it was just the overweight man in his supersuit I immediately didn't like it. The character in my eyes was not the next Buzz Lightyear or Mike Wizowski.The movie is clever in the beginning but the characters are underdeveloped and the story is not that exciting. There are a few times where you chuckle, but not laugh like laugh out louds in other Pixar films.The movie is good, I think it's great for a night to rent if you haven't seen it before. However, I do not think it is a good buy on DVD because it simply doesn't have enough to capture you and make you want to see it again."
4,Worth renting,As an adult seeing this for the first time with my kids i found it hillarious. The kids thought it was slow until the family got to the island and the children got to show off thier powers. As it was they asked to watch it again the next night.
4,Mr. Incredible,"Great movie!Delivery of the order came in good time.This 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with some interesting extras.I found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing.Personnally I would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie. Although it is interesting to watch, especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business, I find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself. Just my personal preference. No doubt others will have different opinions."
5,We LOVE the Incredibles!,"Who wouldn't LOVE this movie?!?!? It's for all ages, especially loved by my 3-4 year-old. He watches it over & over. Parents love it too! Great film!"
5,Yeah that was cool,"What more could you have asked for from an animated super hero film? Not much, this movie has it all: action, adventure, humor, good guys, bad guys, sidekicks, explosions, superpowers and all around family fun. I saw this in the theaters and remember walking out and saying; ""I will buy that on DVD"" I did, and i don't regret the purchase. Neither will you. So go get your copy today, and find out what happens when you babysit a super powered kid."
5,One of the best ever!,"The incredibles was one of the best movies I have seen ever. Regardless of animation or not. The animation is incredible but so are the characters, plot, music costumes, style. Everything. I think it is a perfect 10 of a film."
5,The best Pixar film!,"Pixar always comes up with creative and unique themes. Thinking back on Toy Story, Toy Story II, A Bugs' Life, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, each one is unique, unrelated to anything we've seen before, joyeously satisfying. Incredibles may be their best movie to date. There's something for every age, and it's clever, charming, touching. I laughed throughout. There was so much detail I want to see it again and again.I'm a fan of the James Bond adventures and comic book heros, and this movie takes plenty of ammunition from these, while adding new ideas to each. It's the kind of movie that sets you up, wanting more. I hope there'll be sequels, from Pixar of course, not from Disney."
4,An Outstanding Movie,This movie is awsome.It has a great choice of characters and they all fit their parts.This movie is hilarious.I saw it in the movie thearter and knew when it was over i would buy it well when it was released to dvd.This movie is not just for kids either i have heard many adults laugh at it and seemed to be enjoying it just as much as the kids.It is definatly a family movie to watch on a rainy weekend.If you like animation movies with humor and action for kids I would definatly recomend buying this dvd.
4,The Incredibles (Widescreen 2-Disc Collector's Edition),"We like it. It has alot of action, I did not think that I was going to like it that much."
3,Pretty to look at but . . .,"Not much here. It had a decent story but it really wasn't very funny. It's really made for ""safe"" viewing by families with nothing else to do. Typical Disney, I suppose. Can't recommend."
4,very good service.,bought the dvd it came on time but was scratched. I let the seller know and he replaced it right away with no problems. Everything worked out and i would recommend this seller.
5,incredible,"This is my favorite pixar movie; I can watch it with my kids, and we never get bored.The animation is top notch, and the voice acting is perfect. i dislike animations where you can recognize the famous actor who is voicing the character, but in the Incredibles, it never takes you out of the movie. The story itself....revolves around a retired super hero family (not to different from the Fantastic Four), and a villain bent on destroying all ""Supers"".Brad Bird should be given an award for this movie, it rivals his other great work, The Iron Giant, in greatness. I hope I hope I hope they make a sequel."
1,Pathetic!,"This game is pathatic, and the music...I don't even want to go there. I like fishing games with a storyline like Reel Fishing 3 witch I just purchased about a week ago and it is way better. If you like playing horrible fishing games, then Rapala Pro Fishing is right up your ally."
4,Rapala Pro Fishing,I like this game because it gives you an opportunity to watch your crank baits on retrieval and the different reactions to jerking and cranking techniques.
5,The Perfect Router Bit for the job,Purchased this router bit to make frames for stained glass items I make. It workes GREAT. I was very happy with the product and the arrival time. Thank you.
3,stretch the mind,This book looks at time from angles and perspectives that really challenge the mind. The author is British and some words reflect differences in cultures with Americans. She also documents topics without making a point of value. It forces the reader to make their own value judgment or point from the information.
5,Converting a cliché into a classic,"In this short sharp shock of a novel, Muriel Spark converts cliché into reality. How often has one heard, after news of a reported rape, or murder, or both, the facile comment ""She asked for it""? From the outset of ""The Driver's Seat"" we know the fate that awaits the strange, driven, calculating Lise; and it is a signal indication of Spark's unsparing skill that the reader is trapped in suspense nonetheless. To read this tale takes little more than an hour because, once you start it, it will not leave you alone till it is done. Spark demonstrates what ""asking for it"" would in fact entail; and permits us to judge for ourselves the distance between that, and being the genuine victim of such a crime---through the sheer power of storytelling alone."
1,PLEASE! Say it ain't so...,"Is this the same Shaw that has a law firm on Long Island known as Shaw, Licitra, Esernio, Bohner & Schwartz? The one that receives so much praise, patronage and rewards from the heirarchy of people in power? If you need a lawyer or firm with influence and crooked political connections, this one is among the top ten."
5,An Excellent Chioce!,I'm so glad that I bought this book! It is loaded with a lot of information and is detailed - unlike many of the haircutting books that are around! Thank you Bob Ohnstad!!
5,Good product,"Does what it says. I use mine for drying silk wraps, and it works well just be sure to hold it a considerable distance from the nail to prevent burning"
2,Not recommended.,"The Silver Surfer is pretty much why I don't buy Toy Biz figures without looking at them **very** closely. What the web pictures don't show are how poorly the ""points of articulation"" are designed in the figure. The plastic joints, ""rivets"", and ball-and-socket points are very visible, making the Silver Surfer something of a metallic Frankenstein. Perhaps its the position of his head, but it seems as if his head is out of proportion to the rest of his body. Howard the Duck fared much better. Despite an oddly blank look, his clothes are well-detailed, even to the polka-dots on his tie and pattern on his coat. His trademark cigar, however, is missing. As a Howard the Duck fan, I purchased this figure, but, otherwise, I would not recommend it."
2,suck!!!!!!!!!111,This album is crap! Don't buy it. The music is not from the original singers and instead a bunch of fakes are performing the songs. Buy genuine 80's cd soundtracks and don't get fooled by imitations!!!!!!!!!1
3,Good Deal on wee wee pads,"I'm giving it 3 stars only because I've had crappy quality wee wee pads purchased online before.My current purchase was excellent. No irregular, bunched up, shredded pads this time.I would give a higher rating if the quality of the pads were consistently good with every order."
1,too thin...,I don't recommend these weewee pads because they are too thin. Whenever my dog made weewee the weewee would run off the pads onto the floor..
4,GeoTrax Train,My grandsons play with this set continuosly. They are very durable and the 3 and 5 year old can set it up without additional help. Very child (and adult) friendly.
4,FOR ALL SPORTS HISTORY BUFFS!,"If you LOVE hockey and sports...Please read this one.....Great historical reference to a time when hockey grew ableit in some of the strangest cities.......This book gives a great insight to how the league started, yes survived and ended....The stories are priceless......Derek Sanderson, The Great One and even lots on the Carlson Brothers (most know them as the Hanson's from Slap Shot)......This book even outlines the behind the scenes development of the movie Slap Shot.......!!!!!!!!"
5,Hockey History,Hilarious and troubling accounts of the original rebels who tried to take on the old parochial NHL during a turbulent time. The WHA changed pro hockey in a profound way and not always in a good one. Well written and researched. I highly recommend this book.
2,It isn't what it's advertised to be,"I have a few issues with this compressor. First and foremost, Amazon describes it as ""Campbell Hausfeld HL5502 1-1/2 Horsepower 4 Gallon Oiled Twin Hot Dog Gas Compressor"" as of today (April 4, 2008). It is NOT a GAS powered compressor. It is ELECTRICAL, and you can verify this at the Campbell Hausfeld website. My other big issue is that it is made in China. That may not be a big deal to you, but it is a big deal to those of us that care. My last issue is that for it's size, this thing weighs a ton! It weighs almost as much as my old 15 gallon Campbell Hausfeld compressor (which was made in USA), but at least that thing has some wheels on it to help move it around.Spend a little extra and buy a Jenny or a Thomas compressor if you're gonna get one of these things. Those are some fine machines and they're still made in the USA too."
1,Noisy air compressor,"I just got this compressor a day ago. It came with a Campbell Hausfeld 2 1/2 inch finish nailer, an air hose and a quick release air fitting. The price was $169.00 for all of it from COSTCO. The compressor fills up quickly but is noisy. I have not try out the nailer, but am planning to return the package due to its loud noise."
5,The Way We Cheat Now,"In a literary era glutted with clucking chick lit and (worse) puffed up lad lit, Sigerson delivers a short, stunning bolt of emotional-reality-rescue for real men and women. Beautifully written, shot through with wickedly apt observations, it's a brave look at all-too vulnerable people."
1,"3/8"" shank bits are of little use.","This is a typical high quality Freud product, but I made the mistake of buying this 3/8"" shank bit. It dosen't fit my router. Most routers use 1/4"" and 1/2"" bits. The cost for returning the bit is almost the same as the cost of the bit, so I am stuck with it."
2,Not that impressed,"While this book had a few useful pages (handouts, etc) I felt that it was not worth the price for the limited resources included. I ended up returning the book."
1,FFF,"(...). Seems like it was shot with 35mm film, not like cams used in some of movies. No great sexy shots and mostly scenes of two women getting it on. The only nice part i saw was the opening with lauren hayes ( she's so cute and hot). Too bad she doesn't open the jacket a little more to reveal that one-piece sling it looks like she has on. If your looking for a little erotic and tease and sexiness dont buy this."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought it fairly cheap by buying it used, and even at a low price it was a waste of money!Burn you money instead of buying this at least you wont then have to waste your time watching this piece of trash!"
2,Lesson in Geography,Budapest is NOT the capitol of the Czech Republic. With an error as egregious as this on the back cover . . . well . . .
3,"Yes, Cars is on this one.","Gary Numan is one of the most prolific artists of all time. The Pleasure Principle is the only one I don't think stands the test of time. His earlier two albums, though a little naive at times, surpassed this album. Cars caught us all off guard in '79 and it certainly introduced me to his talent. Observer stands out over the original album tracks, though it's similar in feel to Cars. Conversation is the most tedious track Gary ever released. Thank god On Broadway is on this, but it SHOULD have been added to Telekon as it was a giveaway single in the original vinyl release. The b-sides are all excellant and creepy, especially Assylum. I, Assassin is supposed to be released later this year. If you're new to Numan's work, start with I, Assassin, Exile, Sacrifice or Dance. I have all his work. The Pleasure Principle is my least favorite of his albums."
5,Henry's daughter,"This enthralling book captures the imagination and demands that the reader consider issues of health and humanity such as death, suicide, child abuse, obesity and drug abuse to name a few in a way you never have before. Joy Dettman captivates her readers with an almost believable story. Most of all this novel demonstrates how people (in this case children)can survive when they work together as a united team to overcome odds with incredible resilience."
4,Jayo Felony - Whatcha gonna do,No doubts about Jayo Felony from West Coast. He's been blessed and sent to Planet Earth to make this all happen around him. You'll not regard any music from him. Support him.
3,in public places,"This DVD was filmed outdoors on the streets of San Francisco, CA. If you like looking at nudity in public, this might be for you."
3,Fun Time,"This movie started out questionable but as it went along the story became quite good. The young actors/actresses make the movie believable. The moveie basically is about 4 young men graduating from Navy Boot in San Diego and their wild pass before leaving for more training. The have some ""colorful experiences"" during the weekend that will definitely make you chuckle, for sure. Besides, my cousin was in this movie and I HAD to go see it. If you need a good laugh, see this movie.."
1,"Meant to be funny - boring, boring, boring","I remember seeing this in high school before I joined the Navy. Thank God Liberty Passes were nothing like what this movie showed them to be. It was incredibly boring, rather stupid and just not worth watching. Putting it out on DVD would be a waste of some blank DVD discs."
1,An insult to the Navy,"This piece of crap came out while I was in the Navy stationed in, well.....San Diego and I found it to be purely idiotic and insulting to the Navy. I don't know why any DVD manufacturer would want to waste the time, the plastic and the assembly line to release this.This came out during the wave of 80s exploitation films like Hardbodies, Summer Resort, Private School, Spring Break and countless other ""party"" films that rode on the heels of the great granddaddy Animal House. But what's really worse about this pile of celuloide diarrehea is that these other films were Lawrence of Arabia compared to it, at least they SOME funny moments and launched the careers of some future stars like Phoebe Cates, Tim Robbins and Matthew Modine (and had a few nice pair of knockers thrown in as well.)Don't waste your time, eyes, ears and money on this one!"
1,"Bad, really bad. Not like the Navy - thankfully","I saw this movie just before I left for Navy boot camp (San Diego) in 1984. It was incredibly boring. Thank you to God that the Navy was nothing like this at all. There is no humor to this movie. In fact, if memory serves, people were getting up and leaving the theater when I saw it.The four sailors are on liberty out to celebrate before leaving for their four individual schools. Each of them are trying to meet a girl. In the process, each story is forgettable.Once I graduated boot camp in San Diego, I was glad to find that it was nothing like this movie."
2,"Where'd You Go, Linda?","Linda Ronstadt's Christmas album starts off just fine. She does a wonderful job belting out such standards as The Christmas Song, I'll Be Home for Christmas, and does a charming duet with Rosemary Clooney on White Christmas. Her rendition of Joni Mitchell's River is only so-so, sounding a bit too much like the original to really register.The biggest shock and disappointment is the way the album suddenly switches gears and becomes a series of choir pieces with Linda's voice becoming indistinguishable from everyone else's. It's almost like the musical equivalent of ""Where's Waldo?"" I assume she's somewhere in there, since her name is on the album, but she may just as well have decided to go home by then."
5,The most comfortable multi-purpose solution I've used,"I've been wearing soft contact lenses for 10 years, and this is simply the best no-rub, multi-purpose solution I've used. After my last eye exam, my doctor gave me a free sample of AMO Complete to try. I had been quite satisfied with what I was using (Alcon OptiFree Express), but decided to give AMO Complete a chance. What a difference! I immediately noticed that my lenses were more comfortable when putting them on in the morning. What surprised me, however, was that after nearly 10 hours of wear, I didn't experience the discomfort I usually get. After only two days I was hooked. I've tried all the major multi-purpose solutions (ReNu, Alcon, Boston) and AMO Complete is simply the BEST. I would recommend this product to anyone who wears soft contact lenses."
5,Outstanding critical survey of Contemporary Poetry,"An infuriating critic to most, Logan is sharp, honest, and a careful reader of poetry--a rare thing in American Letters today. It isn't surprising that this collection has been nominated for the 1999 National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism."
2,Not My Favorite,"I have a 5, 7, 9, and 11 year old. All VERY different personalities who need different parenting, which I'm looking for help with. While I totally agree with the primary concept of consequences for your actions, I also agree with alot of what ""A Customer"" says. I didn't like the tone of the book. I couldn't finish it. I have reviewed and purchased ""Pick Up Your Socks..."" and ""Setting Limits..."" I'm hoping it's not quite as ""sicky sweet"" as this book. (I also liked the idea, in this book, of giving the children choices - do what you're told or go to your room - you decide - I use the choices concept.)"
2,The perfect parent writes a book.,"I couldn't even finish this book. I found it patronizing and DRY. I couldn't get past how he constantly used himself as the example of what to do ""right"" and how his son is the reflection of his perfect parenting. Perhaps that wasn't the intent, but that was my perception."
4,"Sound principles, good advice, sometimes hard to follow","The principles of Love and Logic seem very sound. The book focuses on natural consequences and how one of the most important thing we can teach our children is how to think, particularly about the consequences of their actions. Unfortunately, some of the practical advice for handling specific situations (E.g. room clean up) are hard to make work in practice. I've found I mix the advice in this book with the advice from 1-2-3 Magic, which is excellent for stopping ""negative behavior"".In my opinion, the advice in this book doesn't really apply to kids under about 5."
3,parenting teens wit love and logic,this book takes a different approach with teens. I agree with some things but not all. I would use book as a resource but not as the teen bible as it were to face all issues.
2,"Good ideas, but too much self adoration by the author","There were a number of good ideas in here. Unfortunately, you have to read over and over again about how great the author is. There are also far too many references to his previous works. Get on with the book already! I have not yet finished reading it as I have been bogged down by all the extra comments... someone should write an abridgement or some Cliffs Notes for this and then it would be great stuff."
5,This book is a MUST HAVE for all Parents!,This book really opened my eyes about a better way to present things to my kids. Offering them choices really does make a difference. I wish I had read this book sooner!
2,A Pastor,"I'm not opposed to allowing natural consequences to teach children when it is practical; however, this book seems to take this approach to the extreme (see other reviews for examples).While the book is repleat with religious references, the approach seems to be based on Adlerian concepts rather than Christian. Natural consequences should not always be trusted to teach higher principles of empathy, justice, and mercy; values I want my children to embrace. Often, good people must invervene to protect the weak and capable people must look after the disadvantaged.You will likely find a handful of good suggestions in this book but use with caution. For the detached, emotionally unhealthy parent, it could be a powder keg. Boundaries with Kids, in my view, is a more balanced approach."
1,For Anyone Interested...,"Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research!"
5,Practical and simple,"Just gives a very practical and simple way to raise a responsible, mature and self controllable child. So far, the perspective given by this book is working for my 2 year old."
2,Okay for some; not for us,"The principles explained in this book are not made to suit everyone. In our case, this book was a waste of time, as was the grandparent version."
1,didn't get the updated and expanded edition,"I thought I was purchasing the updated and expanded edition, but the book I received was the old version. Seemed misleading to me."
2,Very Disappointing,"I found the book to be rather pie in the sky, with examples of interactions between parent and child you'd expect to have heard on Leave It To Beaver. I appreciate the concept of letting kids experience the ramifications of their decisions, but there just wasn't enough pertinent information or ""rubber-meets-the-road"" approaches to make this book worth the money spent or the time reading it. Disappointed."
1,Not for toddlers,"So far I don't see a lot of information that would be useful with toddlers under the age of 2. I have extensive background with kids between ages 4 & 12, but the toddler age doesn't seem to work with this book.Good otherwise."
5,"Parenting with Logic and Love, updated",Was well written and contained a wealth of good practical solutions. Was purchased to share with a grand daughter who is trying to make a blended family of six small children into a functioning family. She started using ideas on day one of reading the first chapter. Wish it had been around when my children were small. My pastor is now recommending it to the families of our church.
4,A Practical Guide That Reads Like A Novel,"As the author of[...]I found this book full of wisdom and practical pearls of joy. I raised 3 daughters and while, I didn't have this book to guide me, found that much of what we did for our daughters was covered here, but in a wonderfully easy to read style that kept me going to the end. For all parents of young children, this is a must read. Find the pearls and share them with your kids."
1,Christian Book,"Quote: ""Responsible parents want to bring their children up with established spiritual values. They want their kids to have faith, understand the Christian message, and know God intimately. This means involving the family in a church and its activities"".So...people who aren't Christian aren't ""responsible""???!!! OMG, pleeeeease!"
2,Not what we love and expect from Small...,"I am a fan of Beatrice Small and have read alot of her stuff. So one day when I was bored I decided to look up anew book to Kindle. This one looked good! Okay it wasmt her usual historical romance with a young 20 something heroine but, whatever, I gave it a shot. Boy, do I regret wasting $7. First of all, do you know what ""The Channel"" is? A tv channel. Thats right, she put her hand up to the tv screen and was instantly 100 pounds and had a gorgeous man. its a sci-fi romance! And I'm all for a good love scene, but that was sick filth. SICK. This should be flagged as porn for people who dont want to read filth like this. Not romantic at all... sick. So, that, combined with the dumb premise are very good reasons to stick with Beatrive Small's historical romance. At least thats not sick."
5,Hot and Bothered,If you like really trashy books than this is the book for you. If you don't than this isn't the book for you. It is a sexual fantasy brought to life.
5,Praise,A great movie. DVD is of excellent quality and the storyline moves along quickly with lots of humour amid a dangerous situation.
4,The Chill Factor deserves a hot review.,This movie held my attention from the beginning. I won't go into the storyline you can read amazon's editorial review. But I would like to add that this movie has enough action to keep you interested and Skeet and Cuba have good chemistry together. Some of the oneliners are pretty funny. Give this a try. I think you will be glad you did.
3,Chill Factor,"With the movies being as poor as they are this year, this one is pretty good. I wouldn't call it action packed, but a couple of scenes were pretty explosive. If you are looking for action packed footage, this isn't it. The acting isn't bad and their are a few elements of comedy. The story line is pretty typical; REGULAR good guys have something the REAL bad guys want. This movie is worth the rent. If you saw Bowfinger and were not impressed and saw Sixth Sense and really enjoyed it, I believe you will agree with my review."
2,Ulrich and Gooding melt in a so-so supposed actioner,"Skeet Ulrich (Scream, The Newton Boys) and Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Jerry Maguire, Judgment Night) star as a couple of normal guys who team up together and hit the road with a bomb, nicely named Elvis, in the back of an ice cream truck and they have to keep it cool otherwise it will blow up. Meanwhile, the stiff badguy, Peter Firth (Pearl Harbor) is hot on their tail to try to get the bomb from them. Supposed buddy flick doesnt hold up to it's end and the supporting cast is wasted off, Firth's badguy isnt even that great of a villain. Ulrich and Gooding, Jr. are a good team but they arent fit for their parts, though they have some funny scenes, particualarly the scene where they louge the boat down the hill, otherwise it's all throwaway. David Paymer (Mr. Saturday Night, Quiz Show) and Kevin J' O Connor (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns) also star."
4,Cool Flash Drive,"Only if the online version was this good. Had no problems. Simple to install and to uninstall. Started with Taxcut online, finished my Fed taxes only to discover I could not do my state taxes. Had to buy the flash drive. Next year I will just get the flash drive to start with."
2,Good and Bad,"I had a nightmare after I installed this taxcut software. It glitched with my operating system, resulting in ""STOP ERROR"": my computer continuously restart when I turned it off. No remedies worked and finally I had to reformat my computer.Software it self helped me complete my tax eventhough there are some problems like I can not transfer all of my datas from Deduction Pro program. It also helped me maximize my deductions and credits, which I ignored last year. I like the final part where my tax profile is compared with others in nation in my income level."
3,Trying to rebuild after a year of boneheaded mistakes.,"I switched from TurboTax a few years ago to TaxCut. Using TaxCut was a decent experience. The program itself is easy to use and negotiate. Jumping back and forth in the return was a fairly simple process. There were significant improvements over the previous year's version. Which is always a welcome thing.Last year, however, TaxCut made a few foolish choices. First, they stopped making a version for Mac users. Second, they were of no help whatsoever helping those Mac users import their data to either the Windows version of their own program or the Mac version of TurboTax. This marked the end of doing business with them for me. While they have included Mac versions this year, I won't trust them again.BE WARNED: TaxCut customer service is painfully bad."
3,It is ok,"If you like adventure games, you will like this one. It progresses at a slower pace than I would prefer. The load times are appropriate, of course you would want them to be shorter, or non-existent, but it is a reasonable amount of time to wait for this round of technology to process the game you are playing. The graphics are pretty good and the story is pretty good. It is a shorter game, I finished it in about a two days span of time with walkthrough help from an online site. The puzzles are good too, but thank God for online walkthroughs! I did want the story to progress and that made all the difference. Overall a good game to check out if you are into this particular genre, if you are not into adventure games then pass this one by."
2,I guess it's a game.,"It's not really a game. It is more of a story you 'participate' in. The story was interesting, and I grew to like the characters, but it all seemed to mean nothing in the end.The graphics are okay, The soundtrack is good, but there really is no game play. If you are looking for more of a movie or a story, then this is your game. If you are looking for an actual video game, then no."
5,I really miss this style of game,"Point and click adventure games are almost (if not already) extinct. Dreamfall does the genre proud. It's pretty easy, and has little action, but that's not the point. It's a fun interactive story with very nice (especially for last generation) graphics. The story is really interesting, and a real treat for people who played the previous games in the series. The locations are varied and well designed. My only complaint, is that it has a cliff hanger ending, and from what I know, there are no plans for a sequal."
1,Don't waste your money,I was really excited about this product. Huge dissapointment! The cleaning wand is too short for any treadmill. I thought my treadmill belt was narrow and this did not even work on it. This is just a bunch of cheap stuff in a pretty box. I am not sure what the cleaning solvent is. Just smells like soap water. Oh well....I am out $14. Hang on to your money and avoid this.
4,Very Good Product,This little neti pot got me through a bad bout of Pneumonia. It really helped my breathing but I did get rather wet until I learned the correct way to hold the pot.
5,nose relief,This product actually works! Using it is simple and even provides relief from a bad head cold. I recommend it to anyone with frequent allergies or sinus headaches.
5,Neti Pot review,"I recently saw a segment on ""Oprah"" about the benefits of using a Neti Pot to help ease sinus congestion. I have had sinus problems for about ten years and decided to try this treatment. I am very satisfied with the results. It has not completely cleared up my sinus problems, but it has helped clear my nasal passages. I use it 2-3 times per week."
5,Just as promised,"This Neti Pot is easy to use, dishwasher safe and works great. You don't need to buy those expensive solutions, just a little salt and water. If you get a chance, watch the Oprah episode so you can see how its done. I think I would have struggled if I hadn't seen the episidoe. Just reading the instructions is a little confusing the first time. If it goes down your throat then you need to tilt your head forward (my husband learned the hard way)."
4,Inserts are extremly sticky!,"the inserts are extremely sticky, to the point that you must pull very hard on their plastic cover to remove them. Be sure to pick only at one end and pull, if you touch the other parts the whole thing gets ruined like potty clay. Otherwise it works. I just fixed a nail in my van."
1,Terrible. Doesn't work.,"Installed it. Drivers it come with don't apply. I have tried on windows 7, ubuntu 9.10, and windows xp. I found the right driver and installed it after getting it from the website. Card still doesn't work. Only ouputs clicking.Avoid. There is a reason it is cheap."
1,Drivers,"Couldn't get the drivers to work, so I just went to the store and got a different card and it installed right away.. Dont know what is wrong but I didnt even bother with their chat support"
3,It was okay.,"It worked. But, I was expecting more infrared. The infrared unit did not heat up all the way. But, what do you expect for the $."
5,Fantastic heater,"We are loving this little propane heater, got the adaptor and hooked it up to a five gallon tank. Using our courtyard all the time in the evening now!"
2,Starts out ok...down hill from there...,Starts out ok....works just like we wanted...but after a few minutes the valve ices up and output goes so low it basically becomes worthless....
3,Mixed review,"My almost 15 month old son LOVES this Elmo toy. Even though it's not at all soft, he hugs it and carries it around. Sadly, Shout Elmo just doesn't seem to be made for the long haul. We've already had to return one to the store after a few weeks of owning it. Elmo's arms stop moving correctly and get ""stuck"" - causing the toy's motor to just whir and whir -- very annoying. Because my son loves it so much, I bought another, hoping we just got a dud the first time. Well, we've had our second one for a few days, and it's already doing it again.Oh, and Elmo falls. A lot. Every time he falls, gets moved, or gets picked up, it's ""Hahahahaha, Elmo fell down. A little help please?"" Ugh -- it gets old very quickly, and makes me cringe just thinking about it."
2,Started to go wrong within a week,"My daughter was given this. She did like it while it worked but within a week it stopped running through the whole song, would just randomly stop and now the sound is all scratchy. She's lost interest and it just sits in the corner of the room now, unwanted. If I had paid for it I would have demanded a refund, but I don't want to make grandma feel bad so it's just going to go out in the trash."
4,Juguete entretenido,"Compré este juguete a mi sobrino de 2 años y a el le encantó, existe el problema que está en ingles y las instrucciones no las entiende pero con un par de veces que le hemos dicho lo que elmo quiere decir, ya no hay problema, elmo es un personaje muy educativo para los niños, aunque quizás esta juguete en sí no sea su máxima expresión"
5,A great board book for penguin-lovers !!!,Great illustrations make this another wonderful board-book for any family collection. What kid doesn't love penguins?
5,Nice Knobs,"These are very nice door knobs. It is hard to find this color in the store and I am always nervous to order color specific things online, but they match all the other door knobs perfectly."
1,not up to Nora's usual standards,"Mind Over Matter is a pure escapist reading that cannot be taken seriously or realistically. I found it difficult to get through, mostly because it wasn't believeable and the dialogue was so unnatural. I had a hard time looking at it superficially. A clairvoyant mother-daughter duo hooks up with a documentary producer who wishes to portray them in the most positive light possible. The mother is very likable, but the daughter is so prickly and hostile that it is hard to imagine the sympathetic producer becoming interested in her. I have to admit to skimming through the last half of the story because I couldn't bear reading it any further that I already had but I needed to satisfy my curiosity as to whether the story got any better and satisfy my need to know how it ended. The subject matter was interesting and unique enough that the story had great potential if only it had been better developed and was well-written."
3,Good Read,"One of the author's old Category Romances, newly available in digital - and at a reasonable price, too.The hero is OK; we don't get to know him as well as most of Roberts' male leads. Disregarding the improbability of her professional success at such a young age, I really liked the heroine. She was very tightly wound, because she spent almost every moment managing certain instincts. It was a battle always going on in her life. It would be like getting involved with someone who has to manage a chronic illness or handicap. SPOILER ALERT: And I liked that happy-ever-after didn't mean that she was planning to change that.I had a good time."
1,DONT BUY THIS!,I put this cd right up with the Fried pickles.... I like the TV series but this CD stinks.Its boring dumb and they picked stinky songs. Think twice before buying this
5,Feels great on those cold winter mornings,This thing clashes with black leather interior but who cares when its 13 degrees outside and your car is still warming up. Currently in a Volkswagen Passat 2005.
2,the trend continues,"Ok boys and girls, let's take a look at history. Blues and rap were invented by blacks, but it took stupid white men to cash in on their work.Hope you've all enjoyed staying blissfully ignorant and being taken in for fools by these bands. Have a nice day, morons!"
2,Proof that KORN is the Metallica of rap-metal.,"After producing two brilliant and promising albums, KORN follows Metallica's lead in producing a marginally-listenable, low-effort album that rides on the talent shown in its prior releases. This album, instead of living up KORN's potential, is a kitschy, commercial, annoying nightmare with MAYBE 2 or 3 listenable songs on it, including their smash-hit song ""Freak on a Leash"", which itself is heartbreaking because it shows the talent that is still lying under the surface. The reasons I did not give it a one star rating are: They're not an NKOTB/Spice Girls pre-fab clone nightmare; and In honor of their talent which they (HOPEFULLY) will use in their next album should they choose to make one after this Garbage Inc."
5,BEST,"hey! this is probably the coolest cd they made the ideas of korn are so cool like beginning at 13 instead of ending with it, and making a hidden track where all of them switch instruments, and vocal lines. you should buy this, and issues!"
3,i'm buying it after i type all this...,"if you hate this but you like Poison and Slaughter,it must be worth buying . Get my shopping cart ready Amazon,I'm buying this baby.And I'm giving it three stars before I even hear it.The memory of Poison needs to be oblueterated."
1,this should be a no star,"Korn's music has definitely gone downhill. this band has become more of a fashion statement. this means that the music can suck but people will still buy it. but if you like how popularity changes a band's taste (Maryln Manson, Hole, Tool), then this is a definitely good CD for you."
5,Great Band,There very creative band. The energy the lead singer and the other band members put into there music is so fun to here. the music is Just so exciting. You might not want ther cd for they curse but the cursing in it is an idea that the singer felt to have to get alll of his emotions out. I have a friend who thinks that they alll crazy for what the wear but that is only to show off sort of If you Know what I mean. Dont read the peoples comments that have 1 star or two they have no Idea what they are talking about. You might think that they are sitanic bucause of there music and has bad influnces on people is true to people who take the music in the wrong way. Just remember the band out there for fun
3,Overrated,"I like rap. I like rock. Rap-rock is a diffent matter. Rage Against the Machine can do it, but everyone else should give up now. Especially KoRn.This CD is weird. I have got to admit its new and creative, and it has some good songs. Just not enough of them. Despite the fact I complain about rap-rock, I love Children of the KoRn. All in the Family is funny. Freak on a Leash, Seed, and My Gift to You are possibly my favorite KoRn songs. I listen to this CD a lot. The reason, though, that I complain about it is because I skip all the other songs. They aren't that good. They have a rap thing going on in one song that is just messed up, and most of the songs that aren't the ones I listed are the same. And boring. I cant even sit through them. So while there are some amazing songs on it, I would download or burn them rather than but not buy the CD. In any case I would get Issues first.Closing comments:The Freak on a Leash video is probably the best video around."
5,KoRn is great! Good job on this cd!,"Follow the Leader has to be one of the best KoRn cd's so far. With it's loud in your face attitude, and its mixes with rap and heavy metal, this cd is great. Songs like Freak ON a Leash and Got The Life are those really heavy songs or It's On! And don't forget Dead Bodies Everywhere. and then there are those rap songs like All In the Family where Fred Durst and Jonathan Davis are arguing. The song is hillarious! Great Cd you should get it yourself"
1,Rap-metal/Rap rock/ Music sucks,"This kind of rap/metal crossover music is pretty poor to tell the truth. I am a metal fan, but don't have a problem with rap, I just don't listen to it. However, this crossover sucks. The 'metal' riffs are not rock or metal, they are crap from untalented guitarists. The rap lyrics and beats are annoyning and repetive, not to mention juvenile. This is boring for everyone. If you want some good metal get some earlier Metallica, Faith No More, Sepultura, Pantera, or AC/DC. Leave this CD and others like it (Limp Bizkit, Orgy) for teenybopper freaks who think they're tough."
1,RAP METAL SUCKS,"well.... i heard RIGHT NOW and DID MY TIME on the radio and loved them, so i got TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR. and those were the only good songs on the cd. but i decided i could give korn another chance and a friend gave me FOLLOW THE LEADER. he said he didnt really like it. i popped it in and i almost cried. it sounded sooo bad. jonathan davis sounds liek michael jackson with that painful singing. the guitar riffs sucked. i heard GOD DAMN SYNTHESIZERS!!!! WHAT THE F*CK? THIS IS RAP METAL GARBAGE KORN SUCKS, LIMP BIZKIT SUCKS, LINKIN PARK SUCKS!! AND ALL YOU WANNA BE METALHEADS WHO LISTEN TO THEM GO F*CK YOURSELVES! GET SOME OLD SCHOOL METALLICA OR GNR BUT FOR CHRISTS SAKE DONT SPEND MONEY ON THIS BULLSH*T"
3,Good but not Great,"This CD is good. They do a good job on the heavy stuff, but all around they're a stupid band. Korn doesn't sing about anything intelligent. Musically this CD sounds alright.This overbearing band is sadly one of the best bands of the 90's."
5,KORN ROCKS !!!!!!,"Korn is not only my favorite band but, they are much better to listen to the The Backstreetboys if you ask me !!!!! I am forever blasting my Follow The Leader tape. I like all the songs on all their tapes !!!And not only are their songs good but Jonathan Davis is the best!! So for all you Korn fans, go out and buy the tape. And remember BACKSTREET BOYS STINK !!!!"
2,this record is one of the worst,"korn lost all of their energy in this cd. If you're a long time fan that just can't wait to buy this cd, Don't! just go to your local music store and buy limp bizkit's cd's"
5,Follow the Standard and Playing limbo with the greats!,This CD is great! A must have. Most Creative CD I've seen in awhile.
4,AWESOME,this cd is different way different from the first two... the guitar work is more heavier. all of the songs are woth listening to and i think there are no fillers... Pretty good work from Korn. way better than untouchables! but cant beat KORN (self titled)
4,Cooooooollllll!!!.............,"This was a good CD. It gave me some more respect for KoRn. For a while I didn't like them, thinking they were overhyped,epecially by MTV, high school(which I'm in),etc. Then, I listened to this album and I really liked it. Yet though the rap songs are rather weak. I dispise most rap music, and I don't like it's usage on Children of Korn, All in the Family, etc. I really dislike Ice Cube. Although I like the genre of funk/rap-rock, I don't think it works for Korn and Limp Bizkit especially(LB). But I digress. The songs I really liked were It's On,Got the Life,Freak on a Leash, Dead Bodies Everywhere,Pretty,B.B.K., and My Gift To You. Justin,Seed,and Cameltosis were alright. I especially liked the musicbox on D.B.E. I also liked the bonus song. I look foward to hearing their self-titled debut and Life Is Peachy. Ohh... and I think there's a lot of industrial as well as metal. Keep up the good work and rock on KoRn!!"
1,the truth...,real music died when aliens abducted Metallica after ...Justice. this album is further proof. have a good day...
2,"Different, but kinda annoying if you listen to it too much","This is the first Korn Cd i've ever bought, and I was a little bit impressed because I thought the songs other than Got the Life and Freak on a leash, would be just bad sounding fillers. I find that if you listen too it too much at one time, it gets annoying though (the rythm and voice). The lead singer is kinda whiny. The lyrics aren't the best in most of the songs. The rap parts suck. I don't think I'll buy their other albums."
2,What's the deal?,Dead bodies everywhere reminds me of how much this cd stinks. the scratchy sound and annoying beat were enough to make me scream! and the metal/rap thing just dosn't sound good at all.
1,try different music,"would it ever be possible if korn fans would listen to dream theatre, liquid tension experment or bozzio levin and stevens?"
5,This CD is awesome,"Ever since korn came out, they have rocked the music charts. I think that ""Got the Life"" is the best song ever and ""Follow the Leader"" is their best album."
4,"More Musical, Less Intensity","Korns third album features a wider array of musical styles with Ice Cube and Fred Durst throwing some heavy grooves into an otherwise sub par effort by the korn krew. Jonathan Davis's lyrics have less raw emotion than the previous two with a few exceptions. If you're looking for something new, try the first two albums, if you're a Korn fan, you already have it."
4,Korn Reaches a New Level Musically and Lyrically,"To be perfectly honest, Korn's previous two efforts, (""Korn"" and ""Life is Peachy"") did little more than get on my nerves. However, Jonathan Davis' newfound lyrical skills and particularly the guest appearances by Ice Cube and Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, make this an album worth having. Korn have proved that they are beyond their one-chord, mindless screaming phase and are ready to take their music seriously. And ""All in the Family"", the old-school rap insult-a-thon between Davis and Durst, provides comic relief on an album filled with otherwise pensive and dark lyrics."
1,"Horrible, totally Horrible",This has to be the worst album (besides Metallica's loads and covers) that has ever been born into existence!! I give it one start for the fact that i am still surprised on how much these guys sold out to advertisement
2,A great opening ends in dissapointment,"I've been listening to Korn before since their debut album. I thought they were a good band... defintely different. I bought their second album and I was dissapointed but I still liked the band. When I heard the first couple of tracks on the album I thought it was an incredible improvement over their previous albums. They seemed to have grown into their instruments. I was impressed to say the least and then I listened on. How many times can you play the same song over and over and over? The album went downhill... fast. And whats with this ""Parents just don't understand"" B.S? Didn't Will Smith cover this a couple of years ago? I think they need to get off that ""Parents Hate Us"" kick and pay more attention to the quality of their music."
4,A good song from a group I thought was bad.,"I have never really liked Korn, but when I listend to their music video on MTV, I thought it was a very good song. Although when I went to buy the CD from a store, it had the Sticker ""Explicit Lyrics"" on it, and I can't get any CD's with that on it. I would definitly buy it if it just didn't have that lable on it."
3,Korn is an excellant group and has excellant music,"Korn is awsome,but this is there worst cd.It is there worst cd,but it is still worth buying because it has some of there best songs.Korn tried something new by adding a little hip-hop into there heavy metal music and I did not like that to much.People that love Limp Bizkit would love this cd.The cd's distorted guitars sound really cool and makes songs like Freak On A Leash really cool.This cd would be perfect for Limp Bizkit fans but if your a die hard metal fan like me you may not like it."
5,This cd is the best korn cd. I luv it,I think you should definetly get this cd. It is so cool. I hope that you love this cd as much as i love it
5,Korn's Newest is Awesome!,"i really love Korn and this album seems to be working out great. Their tour will be a big success as well as ""Follow the Leader"". ""All in the Family"" with Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit is the awesomest! i can really relate to Korn's music. Korn is Awesome......buy their muzik!!"
1,"what sh*t, I wish I could give this cd zero stars",Follow the leader is got to be the worst cd I have ever heard. It is nothing but halfwits smashing guitars on eachother while screaming into a microphone. Worst yet I saw the band perform at Woodstock and the lead singer wore a skirt and a purse. Get a real taste in music and don't waste your money!
2,"Not bad, but not the best","I've been a Korn fan for 5 years, and I was so excited to hear this new album. I got it the day it came out, and while some songs were really good, I found the overall product to be weak, and uninteresting. Their debut album was amazing and powerful, Life is Peachy was really good too, but this one headed in a wrong direction. I have no idea why this album is being hyped more than their first album, which is 10 times better. Korn has also lost their dark and evil sound, and gone for a really cheezy ""we think we're ghetto"" sound (and image), and I can't take that seriously. The whole pimp metal deal is stupid. Metal is metal. Metal should not be about advertising brand names as Korn has done so dilligently on the inside sleeve of ""Follow the Leader."" A more adequate title for this album should be ""Follow the Trend."" I like ""Freak on a Leash,"" ""Got the Life,"" ""Seed,"" and a few others, but this is not a great cd."
4,Life is still Peachy,"This is a good album, but the first two are better. I still recomend it though."
2,worst album they have put out,"the best korn cd was,by far,the first. if you look at the reviews of the first everyone says it the best which is true. i saw them when they came to New Orleans in October '98 and everyone outside was playing the self titled album. its the best. to bad MTV didn't jump on the korn bandwagon when they first came out, now they're posers like all the other people who loved korn after follow the leader."
3,Can't love or hate them/Mixed bag,The band can rock but they choose to rap.I do not understand how they can have 831 reviews. How can this band get so much air play and the new Deep Purple and UFO be ignored? The rap virus has infected the hard rockers perhaps.I fear that rap will not become a foot note in history like disco.I really do like songs like Freak on a Leash. Almost could give this recording 5 stars out of respect for their fans and the fact that this band has talent. But I could also give it only 1 star due to its rap infestation.I can neither hate or love this band. Just hope it brings more rappers over to rock than rockers over to rap.I still suspect that this band has been marketed better than some true rock legends like UFO and Deep Purple who deserve to outsell this rap 'n' roll.
2,Not the same,"Ok time to put in my 2 cents. I first heard Korn in 97 when Life is Peachy came out. I liked it and stole the cd from my brother. Later I bought the self titled and Limp Bizkit. Now this new cd comes out and everyone says its so cool. I like 2 songs and the Cheech and Chong cover, but this rest is some other band. I'm not saying this because they are played on MTV; MTV plays Fear Factory and I don't have a problem with it. I am complaining because this is not the Korn I knew. I'm not gonna rant and rave about how new metal sucks and you should buy Metallica instead, I'm just gonna say get the self titled one, don't buy this crap, and if you already own it, throw it away."
5,KoRn was the Giant of the 90's,KoRn Follow the Leader Review.All of the KoRn albums of the 90's and the early 2000's was great Follow the Leader is one of KoRn's best CD but i like KoRn's first album and Life is Peachy better.This album is mixed with a rap sound and that is not a bad thing.Jonathan Davis is one of the best singers and this is when all of the band members was in it like Brian Head Welch & David Silveria & James Munky Shaffer & Fieldy that was the real KoRn.Now KoRn is doing all kinds of difference stuff like dubstep now.
1,Cornholio,"Corn is the lamest band ever. They cook up a mindless recipe of mindless drivel in their worst effort to date. Please ignore them and pray that they go away...far, far away."
1,The worst yet,"The only redeeming qaulity to this c.d is ""Got the Life"" which is a poor song in the first place. The other songs are as mature as the Hanson brothers. ""All in the Family"" is one of the most annoying and awful tracks Korn has ever made. Korn appears to be selling out for mass approval. They have traded in their hardcore sound of the first ablum for a more disco sound and rap beats. Yuck. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Children should not listen.,I am a very old lady. Korn is a mean band that uses too many curse words in their songs. Children should not listen to this music. This music is for the devil. Whatever happened to Lawrence Welk?
2,Poorly crafted and overhyped.,This sorry album takes you nowhere. Stick to bands who are not riff-raff hacks.
4,This is the one.,"Korn's ""Follow the Leader"" is the album that got me into heavier music upon its release, which I believe was late 1997. Almost 8 years late, there is obviously better music out there, but Korn's third effort stands out among their albums as the one that got them on the charts. The songwriting here is much better than on ""Issues"" or ""Life is Peachy"" (I haven't really heard the latest ones, so I can't judge). On this album, Korn explores all the possibilities, from exremely heavy (It's On, Got the Life), to slow, plodding monsters of songs (My Gift to You, Dead Bodies Everywhere), hip-hop (Children of the Korn, All in the Family), all while still retaining their classic Korn sound.In my opinion, this was Korn's most creative output, and with the help of a few friends around the music scene, Korn spawned the nu-metal movement which has become so saturated in the modern age. This was the beginning, and I think it's still the best."
5,korn rules!,"If your'e tired of listening to Britany Spears and N*sync on the radio over & over again then i would highly recoment this album with korn's angry lyrics and guitar riffs this album will spare you from all of those lame ass teen ""heart throb"" bands!"
3,POP KORN!!!!,"FOLLOW THE LEADER must be the most well know Korn album... FREAK ON A LEASH, GOT THE LIFE and IT's ON are huge hits! There's other good songs like Reclaim my place, Justin and B.B.K, but i think Follow the leader shows a poppier Korn...A POP KORN! The lyrics are less insane, the sound is less raw and brutal and there's a lot of RAP!!!!! This Rap Crap, i think, is what take KORN off the right road!"
5,Follow the Leader is Awesome,"Korn's new CD is Great. Jon Davis' new vocals are in your face with anger that you shyly back away from. The new mechanical voices are a great new asset to the bands sound. The pedals are great and they provide a very unique sound that I don't see anyone copying anytime soon. This CD also has guest appearances by Cheech Marin, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, and Tre Hardson from the Pharcyde. Check it out sometime."
2,Folle The Leader,It got here really fast. Too bad the CD doesn't even work. The seller was really helpful in that department though and got right back to me with suggestions and offered to refund it.
3,KoRn's GREAT BUT THEIR NOT THE BEST!!!!,As I said above KoRn is great I love this CD so dont get me wrong buy this CD... But on the other hand you have a great CD that gets old pretty fast and sounds quite different and more mainstream than a.d.d.i.d.a.s and Life Is Peachy so if I could do it all over I would still propably buy this CD but I would'nt get my hopes up just tp be disappointed so my final verdict on a scale of one to ten I give this CD a 5.
5,None better!!,"Follow the leader is by far the best Korn CD to date. Issues came in a close second but once you hit perfection it's hard to improve. I definitely can't wait to see if Korn is able to beat ""follow the leader"", when that happens I might have to buy more then one copy because I'm sure I will either wear out the disk or the player listening to it!"
5,Wesley Crusher returns!,"Wesley decides that he must help Captain Picard from being charged with the destruction of the federation starship. In the last book a phantom ship was destroyed by Picard. It had the ability to change it's shape into any space craft imaginable. In this novel the Enterprise goes back to that region of altered space to see if they can capture or disable this other worldly space craft. Wesley was instumental in helping the mission.In this finely crafted tale by John Vornholt, Wesley has to decide to stay as a traveler or return to his human roots....the ending will surprise you.All I can say is if it were made into a movie it would have been better than ""Nemesis""...because it touches on humanity and the need for all of us to be wanted and part of a family."
5,Inspiring,"Wonderful story of a fabulous individual. Sensitively produced, but doesn't pull its punches. Uplifting and horrifying, but ultimately satisfying and hopeful. And the music is fantastic. Treat yourself to this one."
1,It's got a few bugs for Koss to iron out.,"For one thing, the buttons are so small that it's almost impossible to hit the right one after dark. Second, the Anti-skip eats the batteries real quick. And the player will beep only when there's just five or six minutes left in the batteries. Not cool. And to make things worse, the one I bought lasted only two months before it wouldn't play anything.One thing that really works well is the skip protection. Even ""washboard"" dirt roads couldn't make it jump around while playing. And with Koss TD-60 headphones, the extra bass was really something else. Still could have used more, though.My feeling is that it's too little for too much. The next one I buy will be a Sony."
2,"it worked great, but a week later, i can't take pictures","when i first got this camera, it worked perfectly - every photo was processed quickly and the quality was wonderful. after one week of use however, things started to happen. whenever i turn on the camera now, the condition indicator led keeps blinking, and every function is disabled. this camera has become an expensive paper weight. i've contacted the olympus technical support staff, but they are of no help. does anyone know how i can fix this? oh yeah, when you take pictures outside, they come out much too bright."
4,kept me reading,I enjoyed the experience of reading this book. I found myself early into the book hooked. Definitely worth reading and easily recommended to anyone.
2,Narcissist,Book wasn't what other reviews lead me to believe. Wasn't helpful at all. Learned more from articles found through web search from actual licensed therapist. Sent back for refund ASAP!! Don't waste your money and time on this book.
5,Desert wind blasting out your speakers,"The first time I really listened to this album was on a roadtrip through West Texas and into Big Bend National Park. With violins, mandolins, twangy guitars, and melancholy horns; the Theater Fire emanates the same solitary wind that I remember of the West Texas desert. The songwriting is fantastic with tales and characters of the old west, and yet anyone can relate to their situations in these musical tales. This album is definitely worth buying."
3,"this is a great cd, i thouroghly enjoyed every second of it.",please keep trucin boys i think your on to something...
2,A famous textbook but fame does not accord to its contents,"How disappointed when I received the 3 books of higher transcendental functions. The books just packed with formulasand with no examples and no exercises.I think that is not he original ideas of Harry Bateman.One if has a copy of his book on partial differential equations,one would have a feeling that the Bateman Manscript Team actuallynegate Bateman's idea.For BOOKS OF SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, THERE IS NO PROBLEM TO FIND ONE,THAT IS THS ETERNAL "" A COURSE OF MODERN ANALYSIS "" BY WHITTAKERAND WATSON. THIS BOOK IS REALLY A ALL TIME CLASSIC AND THE PRICE IS MUCH, MUCH, MUCH CHEAPER AND THE QUALITY IS MUCH, MUCH, MUCH HIGHER!!!!!"
5,Exactly what we were looking for,"We were looking for an underwater ocean DVD with lots of fish, and the Coral Reef Plasmaquarium 2 DVD fit the bill. We had purchased the original Plasmaquarium DVD a few years ago and the Plasmaquarium 2 DVD was the perfect sequel."
4,very nicely done,"This movie is moving and sweeping. It may be aimed at childrenbut it is excellent for adults. Especialy animal loving adults.nice story, excellent filming, good acting and of course the Cheetah (Duma) is extremely well done.Eamonn Walker as Ripkuan deserves a special mention.Great job, and you do not know if he is be-friendingin the beginnign or not. I recognized him from OZ anda couple of othe places. He brings a specia llayer ofcomplexity to the movie.I have seen some comparisons to fly away home, and I personallyenjoyed Duma a great deal more.It is a feel good movie, and somwhat predictable, BUTin all of the good ways. A nice positive way to end the dayand maybe even reflect on some of the deeper issues if you want.Grief, loss and friendship as well as otehrs are all here.Enjoy the movie on whatever level you want/need at the time.but enjoy it."
2,it wasnt what i expected...,"i thought it was gonna be more like TWO BROTHERS... but it was actually boring... it was far worse than TWO BROTHERS which was actually one of the best movies EVER...well, i dont recommend this movie..."
5,Even Add Some Flavor,Got theses for my grill and didnt know what to expect but they are simply awsome. They actually add some BBQ flavor to the meat I cook on my grill. I love them and this is the only place I can find them.
2,Sharp book but grammar and spelling errors abound,"I want to like this book, because the premise is humorous and so is the writing. However, I gave up on page 33. Maybe it's just me, but if the author doesn't care enough to check spelling, capitalization and punctuation, I feel like I'm being abused. It seems this book was dictated to a machine, because the spelling errors are due to homonyms: ""are"" for ""our"", ""where"" for ""wear"", ""it's"" for ""its"", ""bazaar"" for ""bizarre"". There is something wrong every couple of pages. If you can get past the defects, I think this might be worth reading, but I just kept getting annoyed."
3,A little disappointed,"My son LOVES Blue's Clues/Blue's Room so Santa Claus brought Blues Room Chicka Chicka Conga Blue for Christmas. He does like this toy and he likes to hear Blue sing. I am just a little disappointed with the mechanical sounds of this toy. The mechanical sounds are very loud; not smooth. They over power the music. The toy is also a little heavy for my son to carry around. Because of this he doesn't play with it much. For close to $30, that's not great."
3,Great for LANS,Me and my boyfriend shady always bring this little toy to CPL it's a great way to relieve stress during a match or in the bathroom.
3,Slade,This is a pretty good collection. I knew about a 1/3 of the songs already and the others are pretty good. My biggest complaint about Slade in general is the drums. They never really are mixed loud enough and plus the drummer never really rocks out and hits them hard enough. Every song would be way better if the drums had a little oomph to them. Otherwise they are a good band. The later songs like Run Runaway and My Oh My are so obviously a drum machine but then again it was the 80's and every band used them for whatever reason.
2,It was a bit dissapointing,"Dorothy is an amazing person but I think the book wasn't exactly fulfilling. It was alright but it was missing something. The stories could have been touching but she didn't really write them meaningfully. The stories weren't really touching even though you knew they were actually. She almost wrote without putting the full spirit of each story into them. She wrote although she were talking, not as a formal piece of writing, which was refreshing, but not totally appropriate."
2,Not too happy with size,This did not match up with 23/32 plywood-groove was larger and sloppy fit. I would not recommend this product as a result of the poor fit
5,The Search for Modern China by Jonathan D. Spence,"The Search for Modern China by Jonathan D. Spence is the best single-volume history of modern China that I have ever read. It is clear, objective, well-researched, insightful and well-written. I have been based in Hong Kong for the past eight years with a major US law firm and often go into China for business and pleasure. As I interact with Chinese on a daily basis, I feel that this book has provided me with a much deeper understanding of ""where it all came from"". A must-read for the informed global citizen of the 21st century."
4,My Kids Love Love Love it!,"My MIL had this game for her kids ages 6-13 and they introduced it to my kids ages 4, 6, and 8. I thought my 4 year old would have trouble but he quickly figured it out and has been talking about it non-stop! He begs to go to grandma's to play it. Tonight for atleast an hour we had a 4,6,10, and 12 year old ""battling"" it out. I couldn't pull them away. It might be on the flimsy side but who cares it's fun!"
4,Eye Candy - A Lot of It.,"This publication is definitely delicious eye candy for the graphically inclined. Heck, even the ""changing"" cover catches your eye as you walk by, reminding you of those days of prizing those ""animated"" animal cards from your Cracker Jacks boxes...As for content, there's enough work to keep you uploading for a while. There is a good mix of both real and virtual projects, which is refreshing. It does, however, catch an all-to-brief snapshot of what's current in the world today, and the layout is caught up with itself in a more of a ""lets see how much we can cram into a book and pass it off graphically as the next S M L XL ..."". As an architect well into his career, it is a good reference book, with some of my favourite projects (read from other magazines) contained in it. For the price, well worth picking up."
5,All other reviews are right...it is the best album of the year,"I am typing this review as I am listening to this album and the only thing that I can say about this album and Josh Ritter is simply WOW!!!!!! As I listen to the song ""The Temptations of Adam"" I had the sudden urge to go into tears. His music nothing short of complete awesomeness. He is by far my favorite songwriter all time. I was afraid that this album was going to fall short from his previous work, but Josh just keeps getting better and better."
5,Pubisher's Synopsys of the 2005 edition by Clearfield Publishing. Pub date 1902.,"This is a comprehensive and reliable dictionary of about 25,000 surnames found in the British Isles, arranged in a single alphabet for ready reference, giving meanings, language of origin, and original and variant forms of the names. In many cases, the source or sources where the name was found is cited and/or quoted."
2,Irritating - this is only Vol 2! If you want A-L don't get this book!,"Um, yeah, great reference, but there is nothing in the description here to indicate this is only half a volume. This only covers M-Z."
5,Allen Handgun Case,"Very well made, great product! Surprised how well made this product for the price point! I am going to be purchasing this case for my other guns."
4,great one volume life,"If one wants to start learning about the life of the 32nd President, this is the book the start. Friedel devoted his life to chronicling the life of this great leader. The book is very readable and covers all the important events in Roosevelt's life. The general reader and historian will be impressed."
3,"personally, I expected more","I absolutely LOVED Cash's first recording in the ""American Recordings"" series produced by Ric Ruben. When I learned that Tom Petty and the heartbreakers backed Cash on this second album, I had to have it! But I was disappointed... it did not live up to the standard of the first album. It is just ""ok"" but not ""great"" like the first one. We have to get all the way down the series to ""the Man Comes Around"" before we find another ""great"" recording series from this gang... at least in my opinion. However, I still own the entire series of recordings and you'll never pry them from my hand no matter how hard you try!Marc WaszkiewiczBremerton, Washington"
4,"Walking my dog, Jane nice","I enjoyed reading Ned's book. It was nice of him to share his personal journey across the Alaskan pipeline. If you are looking for a book to inspire you of Alaska's beauty, I would actually think this is not the book for you. I felt it was more about the people and the evolution of Alaska than the actual hike. It was however written in a way that I did find it hard to put down. I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed meeting the people. I found Ned's perceptions of the people and areas to be very blunt. He puts it the way he sees it.It was an enjoyable book to read, and I would reccommend it."
3,what the ????????,"was not impressed by the fact that the product took weeks before it wes even filled and when i did get it it came with a note that said they were out of black so they substituted purple they should have said something in those many weeks about being out of black. Overall this is the only bad experience i have had with anyone on amazon. No biggie, It will be returned though"
4,An Excellent Value...,"I agree with the other reviewers. For a relatively small audio system (or should I dare say clock radio? ), the sound quality is exceptional. It has a warmth and depth that cannot be matched with comparable systems. The display is a disappointment but not as bad as I had expected when I read the reviews prior to the purchase. The design is sleek and elegant. Overall, coupled with the price...it is an exceptional value. I intend to buy a second one!"
3,"Classical and Opera Sucks, Pop Rocks","For the asking list price of nearly $500 and the JBL brand name, I was expecting a system that could compete with Bose Wave CD/Radio. I was extremely dissappointed when I listened to Wager and Stravinsky on the JBL Harmony. Strings sound artificial and like a synthesizer. Bass response was good however. Dynamic range is limited and the sound sounds small. Pop music does sound excellent however with the help from the woofer. While radio reception in stereo sucks, the reception is very good in mono. I have to agree with others on how good the JBL Harmony sounds for its size. But you could do much better with Bose or any other audio systems in the $200 range, at least in terms of sound quality."
4,sweet,"great movie, can't beat it. Good from begining to end as it went from his childhood till now. I'd like to have seen some more now in the movie, but iguess archy still has to live it."
1,Just another anti-American hit piece.,This is nothing more than a very thinly veiled attempt to discredit America and its' position in the world.
2,This Ice Crusher does not please the user!,"It has a very weak motor. If I put more than 3 cubes of ice, it'll stop, until I take some ice out of it, it runs.The ice come out are big pieces, no good!"
4,useful bar item,"the ice crusher is a bit noisy, and I was a little dismayed that you had to put in one cube at a time, but overall I am pleased. it does a good, quick job without any mess."
3,Not Great,"Takes only one ice cube @ a time - and it rattles around a lot, unit seems kinda flimsy, it only slightly redeems itself with pretty finely crushed ice (not quite shaved as a previous review mentions) - there is a professional model listed on here for about double the price ... if you can afford it go for the upgrade, but this unit will suffice."
2,Deni ice crusher,Am somewhat dissapointed as to the coarseness of the ice from this machine. I was expecting a much finer result result.
1,The frame glass came shattered. TWICE!,"The frame itself is beautiful. However, it arrived with broken glass. Packaging was horrible and I notified Amazon of that. I contacted Amazon to complain and they did send me a replacement at no cost. The replacement came... broken glass again. This time with even worse packaging. I feel compelled to share this with potential buyers. I uploaded pictures of the poor packaging and broken frame glasses. Good luck ordering frames from Amazon."
1,Very weak and lacking better data/network books available,This book only lightly touches subjects that any begining or intermediate network engineer would need to know about. The problems at the end of each chapter ask questions that are not addressed by the author or he only touches on briefly. Therefore making the reader locate another source to answer the authors question! He is to much into signal theory (who cares how I square wave is constructed) when was the last time you got out your O-scope to check and watch the signal variations on your network. It seems that this book is just thrown together to make a quick buck. Avoid it at all cost.
4,A good text to learn Nstworking from the gound up,This book will provide a sound basis for understanding the electrical principles behind computer and communications networks.
1,This book is NOT for beginners,This book is definately for intermediate professionals NOT beginners. You can get high-level concepts from the books but the details and mathmatics behind the concepts are severely lacking. You cannot even answer the problems at the end of each chapter with the information given within the chapter. Avoid this book if you can -- if it's required text for a course then plan on buying supporting material.
4,"well organized, right amount of depth","Stallings went a bit into signal theory and some people don't like it. There is no book that can satisfy everyone, or answer everyone's every question. To me, it is a good technical book as long as (1) it justifies its price by having a reasonable amount of content, cohesive with the title and editorial reviews. (2) It has a good balance between rigor and ease of reading. In my opinion, this book satisfies both of the above, and it happens that I like the fact that it goes into signal theory. It is a good textbook for student who wants a short cut to communication fields without too much pure classroom math or EE stuffs, although practising engineers may not even need that limited amount of math."
4,Ride the river by l. Lamour,Great story with many facts about Pennsylvania. Enjoyed the many stories of the mountain people. Always enjoy Louis L`amour books.
5,what can i say,what can i say? He's the KING of pop music!It beat a lot of pop albums then and still beats most of these so called pop albums now!
4,Finally on his own,"the album was Michael coming out party the album was his chance to put the music out that he wanted us to hear it included a lot of disco music this showed Michael's ability to keep up with the times it also showed everyone who doubted him to keep up his fame as a artist despite his growth one of with classics like ""Don't stop till you get enough "" Michael showed why he would later on be known as the king of pop"
5,Michael at his best,This clasic Michael Jackson. Contains demos and comentaries by Quincy Jones only available on this limited edition. A Michael Jackson must-have.
5,""" IN LOVE AT TEN YEARS OLD"" THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE","I can remember when my mother gave me this album as a gift for my birthday. That was the best gift anybody could ever give. I can remember listening to this album all day and all night, until i would fall asleep by the record player. I still have the album of course, but i want it on CD now. My favorites on the LP are don't stop till you get enough, working day and night, get on the floor and dance with me. I must say this is his best he has ever made. The entire album is incredible. For those of you who don't have this LP take it from a ten year old fan, now much older and still a fan. ""GO GET IT"""
5,Great Album,"This album was Michaels first album with Quincy Jones. And in my opinion it was the best album of the 70's. My favorite songs on the album are Working day and night and Don't stop till you get enough, but all the songs on this album are great."
4,Awesome,"The album sooner than expected and in good condition. I would give 5 stars but the album cover was worn, however the album itself was in immaculate condition."
5,"Excellent, one of MJ's best!!!!!","All the songs on this CD are fantastic, especially the title track, ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" ""Working Day and Night,"" and ""She's Out of My Life."" Also of interest are the two home demo recordings of ""Don't Stop till You Get Enough"" and ""Working Day and Night."" Anyone who is an MJ fan simply MUST have this CD. A real classic."
3,"Not detailed enough, too abstract",This is a great book for ideas for unusual and creative items to build. Is is NOT a great book for techniques for the average beginner. There is not enough detail as to the actual techiniques. It is a better book for an experienced artisan than for beginners.
1,"dirty water, dirty tracks, just plain dirt","man i was tricked. I have heard David Banner as a guest on so many records and his lyrics and style is hot. I heard the song cadillac on 22's and was like ""oh no dude is the truth"" so i got this cd. i hate it. A lot of unnecessary cursing and lyrics that don't make sense. Talking about God and in the same breath cursing up a storm a severe waste of my money."
1,This is a PERFECT movie; this DVD release is NOT,"If you are a fan of Totoro (and what right thinking individual isn't!) then you may want to leave this DVD release on the shelf come December 3...In Japan, Totoro was graced with a spectacular DVD release featuing multiple dialog and subtitled options, as well as featurettes, artwork, and options for both full screen and letterbox versions...i the meantime, I would recommend this version ONLY to friends with small children who have not seen the film before. The print quality of the VHS version was quite good and the dubbing job is excellent, considering the shabby treatment that most Japanese animated films recieve. This is, first and foremost, a film of remarkable beauty and warmth. It is precious and timeless. By all means take advantage of the low price and share it with children. But for your own collection, you will most certainly want to wait for the (cross your fingers and send those letters now) Disney Edition."
5,great family movie,"I think that this movie is great for the entire family. I first saw it when I was about... 4 or 5 I think.. It's a very good movie, for kids especially. If you liked this I highly recommend""Spirited Away"" which is also directed by Hitoshi Takagi."
2,thought it was the original,"i loved the (english version) original when i was younger and wanted it, but this is a recent remake and the voices are different!"
1,Not compatible in the US,"I'm sure the story is great, but was not able to watch it. Tried several DVD players, none compatible with this DVD."
2,The Reason for the Poor Packaging,"Ok, I'm a Miyazaki fan, we all know this movie is a masterpiece so there's no reason to bring that up. The movie easily gets 5 stars. The main concern here is the DVD. 20th Century Fox had very little to work with when they did this DVD. For those who don't already know, Disney has owned all of Studio Ghibli's movies since 1996. This includes My Neighbor Totoro in widescreen, Japanese, and anything they could hope to call an extra. That's why Disney is redubbing the movie and that's why this DVD has almost nothing on it and why they couldn't even remaster it. They worked with what they had and did the best they could. Of course, when Disney releases their version, it will have many more features(thought I don't think they will ever top this flawless dub unless they work their magic like they did with Spirited Away.)"
1,Very Disappointed,"I am extremely disappointed that there is not even a Japanese language soundtrack. Totoro is a beautiful movie, but I wanted the DVD so that I could have the Japanese language version with subtitles."
4,Great for children and preteens,"Any fan of childlike sweetness will love this movie. Every character is innocent and friendly. No one is hurt. There is no violence. The only antagonists are situations that cause the family concern for eachother. Very small children may be upset when a little girl is lost, though nothing bad happens to her as a result. Parents should be aware that there is a scene in which a father is taking a bath with his daughters, a cultural difference that made preteens somewhat uncomfortable. Christian parents may not appreciate the idea of honoring spirits and similar ideas typical of Ghibli movies. Overall, however, the movie is very good -- an excellent choice for family viewing."
3,"a ""me too"" on the new dubbing -- a major disappointment","This just shouldn't have happened. What were they thinking?Frankly, I didn't think the Fox English dub was perfect. The voice actors seemed a little too earnest. Let's just say I thought it lacked subtlety, but in what is basically a children's movie, this is quite forgivable.The new Disney English cast changes the way we perceive the characters, and not for the better. It makes Totoro somehow darker. There are dialogue changes (compared to the Fox edition) which simply do not work for me, apart from issues with the voice acting itself.The Disney version is still a charming movie, but the Fox version is more charming. The Fox dubbing makes it more sincere, in a way."
1,Disney's DVDs really blow,"If I buy a DVD, I should be able to get to the menu without being forced to watch a bunch of stupid promos.I love the movie, hate Disney's interference."
4,needs to be more secure in case,Fast service. My only problem was the desk was loose in its own case. When I took the package out of the mailbox the dvd was rattling around in its case so it was subject to more scratches. Seller needs to make sure disk is clean and secure in its case before mailing.
3,An awful version of a wonderful film,"I have never reviewed and item before, but having just watched the disney version of ""totoro"" I had to add to the objections already posted. I have a 4year old who loves this film, having seen the fox version many, many times; however, after only several minutes into this version of the film she objected to the new voices. In her opinion the 2 girls now sound like boys. I think ""boys"" is a strech, but they defineately sound bratty, too old and not like innocent little kids who can see Totoro. From both an adult opinion and that of a child---Try to find the Fox version. All the voices are better and much less ""americanized"" in the fox version. I'm tired having to have famous names tied to animated films. I really don't think kids are going request a film purely because of Dakota's voice and most adults probably aren't either. The fanning sister's voices are no match for the wonderful Japanese animation. I wonder what the executives in TOKYO Disney really think!!"
1,My Neighbor Totoro,Unfortunately this is the Japanese with English subtitles version and I was looking for the English version. I am not sure how at this point I can exchange this for the correct one but if you can respond to me that would be great.
1,absolutely furious,"Big fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki, but this isn't the movie from my childhood. This is a crap redub. I am now on the lookout for the Fox version aka the better version. Way to fail Disney."
2,Dissapointment in this re-release,"I had originally watched this movie with my girlfriend about a year ago before this new edition came out and i loved it. She's always loved it, so i got it for her for christmas. The only thing I didn't realize is that they changed the characters voices. Also, they redid some of the parts in the movie, which I thought was completely unnessary. I hate the people they picked to re-do the voices, Dakota Fanning for example. They didn't need to do this, I wish that they still sold the original on amazon. It's not what I first saw and that sucks that they rereleased this movie for no reason."
3,Disappointed in return policy and won't buy from this distrib. again,"Beware...this is not the same as the original VHS movie that FOX did long ago. It has been redone by Disney and unfortunately, the voices, as well as the words, have been entirely changed. My children were crushed, especially since some knew it word for word. My complaint is that I returned this in tact and perfect to receive a little over $7. in return.(orig. 19.99) I'm sure there was some small print somewhere, so it is my fault, but I have a hard time believing they would deduct so much from my return. They are getting top $$$ for these even ""used"" videos. Unbelievable, I would have kept it. I won't purchase from this distributor again!!"
5,Hoping this release is Better!,"I refrained from purchasing the previous (and out of print) 20th century Fox DVD version, because of all I'd heard about the full-screen only, dubbing-only, lack-of-extras... Here's hoping that whenever this edition is released, those problems will be fixed and the second disc will be chock full of extra goodies!!"
4,My son likes TOTORO with English and Japanese.,"We enjoy watching this DVD.My son has watched this movie with Japanese already, so he understand it.I recomend that if you want to learn English for kids, you'd better them watch English versionat first."
5,Awsome,"Was fast delievery and a wonderful, timeless classic. This movie is great for all ages...it makes one feel like a young child again."
5,Healthy and wonderful viewing for kids 3 to 14 or so,"This is a wonderful film. Fine music, great animation and a truly wholesome, funny, sweet, fascinating and imaginative story about a family living in the country. Magic and special things are going on, nature weaves a sweet spell on the kids and interesting things occur.Length? Just right for viewing by little ones and an adult along with them.With all the violence and cruelty in this world and in film, this is a refreshing change of pace for your family and especially for your little ones. Our four year old adores this DVD, with very good reason...give it a try and you will not regret it."
1,My Neighbor Totoro,The animation was lovely but the movie was boring and the screeching and giggling of the 2 girls was incredibly irritating.
5,Totoro is the best Anime/Movie ever!!!,This a great anime.It has to be the best or one of the best animes/movies ever.The whole idea is really neat.The animation is really nice and the dubbing is great.It also has a very strong Japanese feel to it if you like that sort of thing.The music is cool to!I strongly recommend this to anyone who likes animes or movies!!^_^
3,A step backward in the performances,"Disney continues its lack of respect for Studio Ghibli's wonderful material. As a company that only sees ""product,"" My Neighbor Totoro doesn't get the attention it deserves. (It deserves a theatrical re-release, actually, but I digress). Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning do their jobs, but they are not better than the actors in the Fox version. Professor Kusakabe, the father, is given a lesser performance, as is the grandmother.I was also vaguely disturbed by the music, which sounds different to me in small ways compared to the Fox release. Jo Hisaishi's terrific score deserves loving care.The positive here is that the visuals are better. I was glad for the wider format, and the colors were more vibrant, closer to the amazing color of Spirited Away, the best colored animation in many years.I wish I could show this version with the Fox soundtrack."
3,Buyer Beware - NOT the same video as original!,"This is one of our all-time favorite movies. My kids grew up with the original VHS version. The three stars were given because this is NOT the same version that we remembered and although we love the movie, we hate this version. This version has different voices, some different music and even different spoken lines in some places. We were very disappointed with these changes. After doing some research, we realized our mistake. This DVD version is different because it was put out by Disney whereas the original was put out by Fox. Apparently, there are two versions of this movie and we prefer the Fox version much better. Even though the Disney version has the celebrity voices of Tim Daly and Dakota Fanning, it lacks the quirky joy of Hayao Miyazaki's original version. If you are a fan of the original english VHS version, be sure to look for the Fox version! Now we have to purchase the Fox version and find a way to sell the Disney version - Bummer."
3,Original audio track is missing!,"It is sad to say, but original japanese audio track isn't in this DVD.Only english dubbed, and I just wonder why.In the disk, there is lot of room in both languages and subtitled version, or even without subtitles is better than this.Not that dubbing people is done something wrong, but publishing company lives in stone age."
5,THAT IS SOOOOOO CUTE!!!!,"My neighbor totoro is the most magical film I have ever seen. Written and directed by my role model, Hayao miyazaki. My Neighbor Totoro is the story of two children and their father who move to a house full of mystical sprits.(That are cute beyond all reason).This movie is full of the cutest and fuzziest characters you could possibly come across, including three different kinds of totoros, billions of dustballs with eyes, and a catbus. All of which are animated with beauty beyond compare, which is expected seeing as how it's a studio ghibli production. The english dub is very good compared too most anime.I've seen the VHS version and I can not wait until the DVD comes out. I'm definitely getting it. Hopefully it will come with the japanese audio as well as the english!Thanks for reading."
5,love it!,"We have it by our back door and love the fact the dog cannot destroy it! It is large enough to wipe your feet well before you come in the house, too. Highly recommended!"
2,Ho hum...,"I had a hard time getting into this one. I almost gave up on it a couple of times within the first 100 pages. I did get more involved at that point, but I never was able to stay invested in the story line for any significant amount of time. Just when I was starting to enjoy a section, the author would lose me again. It could be that I am just not all that interested in ancient Egypt. Perhaps if I were, I might have cared more about these characters. Not bad, just not great."
5,kleopatra,Wonderful book anyone interested in ancient Eygpt will find it extremelyeducational yet one must remember that this is historical fiction.
4,The Only Alien on the Planet,"I love love love this book. I read it a couple of times when I was still in school, and I came across it online and had to order it so I could read it again.I noticed that it reminds me a lot of the Twilight series, so if you're a fan of those you'll definatly enjoy reading this book."
5,Great starting place for any 12 step program,"If you haven't done a 12 step program before, this is truly the best first step. It will help you decide if you are powerless regarding your addiction. It helps you realize how bad it has become and how much the addiction affects your life. Buy it and start your best first step!"
4,thought there were CD slots?,"Bought this for my father, it came very quickly and in good shape. The only thing is that when I purchased it, I had thought I saw CD slots on the opposite side of the harmonica pouches but there weren't any. There is only one small pocket on the opposite side. Good nonetheless."
4,ENTER TO THE REALM OF SATAN!!!,"Best thrash metal album of all time?? Probably not.this album is wicked,but you cant really compare it to such classics as ""Master of Puppets"" or ""Vulgar Display of Power"".Straight away it hits you with one of the best songs ever created ""Angel of Death"" everything a metal song should have,heavy,powerful,brain damaging vocals,and an amazing riff.But after that there's nothing really mind blowing,except ""postmortem"" and ""raining blood"".This is a really great album but not the best."
1,kerry king and Hanneman can't kid everyone,"This album is really comical, Hell Awaits was respactable even interesting but this always has been a joke. The guitarists clearly needed a good dose of Johnny Marr."
3,slayers best but,"no i'm not gonna throw this album away because of the satanic lyrics or because i listened to metallica master of puppets i've looked at all the 1 star reviews and can honestly say that even though the death and dying and satanic lyrics show immaturity in songwriting, this album is still groundbreaking . though at times i think it is just mindless rambling but stilll i let the album grow a bit and i started to like most of the songs.again the satanic and death and dying are both corny.but i can still honestly that overall this is a fairly good album."
5,Greatest Thrash Album of all Time,"Of all the awesome thrash albums out there, Reign in Blood always finds me crawling back. This is one of the most intense albums I have ever heard. Every song is awesome; there is no crap on this album. Listen to this one on volume 11. Two words: F***ing awesome!"
2,Eh....,"First off, let me say I love metal. Sabbath, Pantera, Iron Maiden, (old i.e. pre-Black Album)Metallica, Megadeth, it's all good. But this....what is this? It's just noise, that's it. Yeah, there are some VERY good riffs (Angel of Death and Raining Blood come to mind), but everything else.....it's just noise. Seriously, I'd listen to St. Anger before I'd listen to this.* I dunno. Personally, I do not like it. But there are a lot of people out there who do, and that's fine I guess. It is without a doubt one of the msot influential and (in)famous albums of all time however.*Ok, a bit of an exaggeration, but still..."
5,You Suck at Life,"Yeah I love listening to Fall Out Boy and Good Charollete when I really need to rock hard. Fall Out Boy are a bunch of pussies from my hometown who sucked when they played at my high school last year and they continue to suck now. I can maybe on my most generous day see why you teenie girls listen to that crap, but for you to go around saying that Dave Lombardo (drummer of Slayer) has no talent is not only asinine, it may very well be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Your heroes spend about 5 minutes coming up with their songs, and if it takes them longer then they are alot worse than i originally thought. You are the ""American Idiot"" who buys that garbage and keeps bands like Megadeth and Slayer off the radio."
2,repetitive...,"Ummm... if you want good speed/thrash metal, buy some early Metallica and Megadeth albums... or Slayer - South Of Heaven"
3,Goin' Nowhere ...but really really fast,"I'm not a thrash fan really but listened to this album cause I have known of Slayer for a long time and what I can say is that this album is really ... fast and heavy . The lyrics are kinda Bad ""B"" horror movie type and aren't really sung as much as shouted ,that is when you can understand them . The true highlights of this album for me are the awesome speed of King's and Hamerien's guitar's and the powerful uncomparable drumming of Dave Lombardo , all in all this album is worth a listen if you're a hard rock/metal fan You just might suprise yourself but for me this album is about 1 thing Serious Speed other than that is doesn't do to much else ."
5,The Impact of Alzheimer's,"This book really makes you think about the impact of Alzheimer's Disease on the patient and on you as the caregiver. It is not an ""easy read"", but it is a worthwhile book to read and to come back to as you deal with the disease."
5,A REAL PAGE TURNER,"A Canidate For Murder, is a really good book. I request this to anyone who likes mysteries and suspense."
4,****Really Good One!!!!***,"If you don't like to read, you should definetely check this book out! ITS ABOUT a girl accidentally!! hearing on two men talk about a murder, which was a BIG mistake! Now those men are after her.......but little do they know that the suspects are right in their face. When the girl finds out.........SORRY! YOUR GONNA HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!! BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
4,Grandmas need grandchildren,"My 3.5 yrs old grandson thought this was very funny, and has asked me to reread it to him, but my 6 yrs old granddaughter thought ""It was too silly."" illustrations are very colorful and fun, and appeal to the young ones who want to read ""by myself."" This Grandma liked the story and the illustrations."
1,GRAVE PRODUCTION,"Okay, this movie stinks. Horribly produced. Bad acting and the list goes on and on. Horrible lighting and fake sets. Now I know where they put washed up stars at. This movie doesn't even go by the book. Read the book if you really want to know what this family went through...the movie isn't even worth the discount bins."
4,works well for the money.,"this works well for a little 10ft pool, does seem to hold in and heat the pool when you get a good days worth of sun. worth it."
3,Does what it's suppose to do...,"Basically it is glorified bubble wrap cut to size. I have an 8 ft. diameter pool and it hangs over the sides a bit, but it works. It helps to keep tree droppings out, as well as warm the water some. We have found that it typically warms the top 6"" or so of the water, but when you get in and mix the water around I guess it helps. Have reasonable expectations. This is not a pool heater."
3,crappy pool cover,This is nothing more then a bubble wrap tarp! Yeah it heats the pool but so would any tarp put on top! It does not secure in any way to the pool it just rests on top. Would quickly blow away in a storm or high winds.
2,Not what I thought,"I was disappointed with the 10' solar pool cover. After purchasing this product by mistake, I purchased a 10' debris cover for my pool. The solar covers merely lay on the top of the surface of the water in the pool. It does not secure to the pool, or prevent debris from getting in the pool. The debris cover goes completely around the inflated ring of the pool and is secured with elastic and a pull-string"
2,"One good song, the rest mediocre (Buy ""I Ain't Movin'"" instead)","This album basically had one good song - ""I'm Kissing You"" from the soundtrack to the 1996 version of Romeo & Juliet. The rest are pretty mediocre. Wish I could have just bought that one song. If you want to hear Des'Ree at her best, buy ""I Ain't Movin'"" It's a much better (actually EXCELLENT) album."
4,Comfortable and convenient,This is a great pair of trousers. Doing floor work has proved the cut to be very good and the convenience of the pockets and leather to be just right.
5,Fab!,This is just perfect if you haven't brought all the BSB autobiography's released and can't find then anywhere. It contains BSB autobiography sets from years ago.
4,Works great!,This is the only toilet paper roll that I could find any feedback on. And works fantastic. My daughter hasn't figured it out yet.
3,"Very informative, but hard to understand...","Let me just say that there is a lot of information on this book, and the author thoroughly covers everything! However, for someone who was looking to learn how to make candles it was way over my head. The way the book jumped around didn't really leave me an organized way to figure out my first step in making candles. I gave it to a friend and hopes she has better luck with it!! I think people that have some experience will find this book very helpful!"
5,Good Buy!,I bought this book about a month ago and have found it very helpful. It does not have any photo's but more than makes up for it with lot's of good drawings on a wide variety of candles.
5,A++++,"Wow, super delivery service and an exceptional good quality. I am delighted with the product/service.The book held good resources for good theme topics at school. A must have book."
5,PERO COMPA YO QUISIERA LA MISA CAMPESINA COMPLETITA,asi mera como rezamos cada domingo con el compa PAdre Uriel Molinaya no se hallaposno hay fallano hay fallasolo mis recuerdos
4,An excellent introduction to gnosticism,"Richard Smoley's book is an excellent introduction to Gnosticism for two reasons.The first relates to content. His long experience with the magazine 'Gnosis'has enabled him to cover a very wide and varied field in a way that intoduces the reader to the various strands of Gnosticism, both ancient and modern,without bogging down in unnecessary detail. He does not attempt to avoid difficult issues nor ignore inconsistencies between the various traditions. The section on modern expressions of Gnosticism is particularly insightful. For me this book made for excellent reading.The second is a matter of style. HIs English expression is easy to read; he carefully explains unfamiliar terms and he leaves his personal prejudices aside."
1,A DooonKeeey Tale,"Before I give my view about Home Inspection from A to Z DVD by Guy Cozzi, I like you to have an idea about me. I am a 40 year old, very active male. My degree is in Electrical Engineering Technology, and I also majored in Theoretical Physics. I have installed dc powering plants and installed communication networks for eight years - I know who to install and program.Now, I will state why I bought this dvd. I wanted material (book and dvd) that will illustrate on how detect damage structure (floors, ceilings, pipes, and boilers) in a house. To be able to see a very costly investment is a good thing.After I viewed Home Inspection from A to Z DVD by Guy Cozzi, I started to laugh out loud to myself. Guy vaguely talked, not illustrated, about damage. He mainly pointed to a good wall (floor, or ceiling) and vaguely said what he thinks could happen. I felt like a Doooonkeeey after watching this dvd."
2,no daisies,I'm sorry to say that this is something of a disappointment after three superb albums. I know he can do much better and I hope the next one is more like it.
2,not the match,"Hello,The photo is not the match for the honda cb900f supersport 1981 which i have. All photos are the same. Why?"
1,Not Useful,"This book is the same as the previous edition, not useful for CSA exam. This book was made initially for different audience...OSCE exam is not true that this book is oriented to CSA. Don't waste your money in this book."
4,Finger condoms,Well that's what they look like..lolThese are good for applying topical medications and the like.The seller shipped them fast and the price was reasonable.
3,"Well Done, But..","I purchased this video for my father, who is a WWII Navy and Air Force Veteran. It is good, the color certainly makes it more watchable, but somehow it missed hardly, if any mention of the Leyte Bay/Gulf battle. The Battle for Leyte Gulf has been characterized by Samuel E. Morison(in 1958) as ""the greatest naval battle of all time"". The amphibious invasion of Leyte Gulf in October,1944, assembled the largest number of ships(over 700) to that date. I am not attempting to write any history here, just wondering why the largest sea battle in ""history"" was basically forgotten in this video? Possibly to sell another, separate video? The Leyte Gulf video has been produced, but to basically exclude Leyte Gulf actions from a ""WWII IN COLOR"" video, seems a bit .... A few less pictures of Hitler, and a little more about the largest sea battle of WWII, would help the video provide those of us with parents who survivied WWII with a better perspective of the War."
5,WONDERFUL,"I was given these as a gift, and I loved them. So, now I buy them to give as gifts. I've given them as hostess gifts, birthday gifts, Mother's Day gifts and Christmas gifts. They always get rave reviews."
3,must have for 3.5,"This pretty well nails the coffin closed for ""Defenders of the Faith"". It updates most Prestige classes, and adds some very interesting new ones.It also has some very cool new feats, and some stuff on the Greyhawk pantheon- which is good if you're in that world. Personally, I think that was a waste for most of us.I'd give it a 4 if it wasn't for some terrible editing. There are some glaring typos, two of which woudl be game-breakers if read ""as is"". One spell (Miasma) that forgot to add the fact there is a Fort save. And a feat(Divine Metamagic) that if read wrong (yes, you do have to have the metamagic feat first, and yes it only works on divine spells) makes it a killer.There is no excuse for this slipshod editing on a hardcover book of this price."
2,Where's the Druid?,"This book is alright, and adds several useful prestige classes geared toward clerics, as well as some moderately useful feats and content, but the other divine spellcaster, the druid, is almost completely neglected. I mean, the Complete Warrior book gives the druid more useful prestige classes than this book (Nature's Warrior and Warshaper). Where are the interesting prestige classes from the Masters of the Wild like Verdant Lord, Animal Lord, Shifter, and Tamer of Beasts? The druid is my favorite class and they get almost nothing out of this supposedly ""Complete"" Divine book. Even many of the prestige classes geared toward clerics are only moderately useful to completely unplayable."
2,"pay a little, play a little","The track provided some fun but didn't last long. This is not going to be the racetrack our son (or daughter) is still going to have when he/she goes off to college. Our track lasted approximately four weeks. This timeframe is without trying to take it apart and building another set-up. We just left the original set-up because the plastic prongs on the bottom of the tracks are too hard to loosen. After about 4 weeks (of heavy use I might add), the tracks kept disconnecting, the cars weren't staying on anymore, or the connectors of the cars had to be constantly readjusted to work.I can't say I regret buying it because my son had a lot of fun with this toy while it lasted. However, if I had to make the decision again, I'd probably go with something more expensive."
3,If You Say So...,"I gave this book three stars. I feel the contents of the book were somewhat exaggerated. Neither the ""Slave Narratives"" nor other books written by former slaves, contain any of the material found in this book when expressing life on a plantation as a slave. I find it very hard to believe anyone claiming to be a slave for fifty years could, somehow, write and express themselves this well. My own opinion is that this book is the work of an abolitionist of that time and was written based on hearsay, personel beliefs, and with maybe a few actual facts thrown in for good measure.It is a well written book, containing everything that makes a good and exciting novel. Hair-breadth escapes, last minute reprieves, treachery, romance, and like Forrest Gump, this man, even though a slave, seemed to always be in the middle of the scene, even it it did not directly concern him. The events of his life just fall into place to easy for reality.You read and you decide."
4,Nice Product,"It was a decent size, and quality of construction appears good. It is a gift for my neice, I cannot comment on actual use."
4,A little snug,"I was hesitant to get this bag because I have adult women's size 9 skates and was afraid the bag would be too small. It is a little snug but the skates still fit. I like the larger compartment in the middle to put water and sweats, though. All in all, this is a great bag for the price until I can get a Zuca bag."
4,I was happy with it,"For the price of about $50 new, I was happy with it. It was my first mp3 player and it fulfilled my basic needs as I worked out on an exercise bike."
3,"A average, normal cameracord","The JVC GR-DVF10 lets you take still photographs in a number of formats, from simple snapshots to borders and even multiple thumbnails. If you want to download and edit your digital still images and video on a computer, however, you have to purchase a separate video capture card first."
4,This unit was even better than I expected,I purchased my Digital Camcorder while visiting the baseball spring training in Florida. I hadn't really done a lot of research but was an owner on an Hitachi Camcorder and had numerous electronic problems with it. I found this unit easy to use with one review of the instruction manual. I agree with the person from Orlando that the off/on switch is cumbersome but it is something you have to adjust to. The snap shot feature is great as it gives you a great still picture and breaks up the traditional viewing of a long recording. The clarity of digital is superior as I have my old VHS cassettes to compare it to. I'm in the market for JVC's JLIP unit which allows you to interface the camcorder and computer for downloading pictures. I paid 1/2 the price for this unit vs. the Hitachi and would totally recommend it to the everyday family movie taker.
3,not as good as previous,"This book was not as good as his previous two, partially because his main character was a fighter pilot and since Huston was also a pilot he had way too much fighter pilot filler in the book and missed doing an interesting story. I would have prefered Ricketts (a spy like Clancy's Clark) to be the main character or even Sami and to have resolved more of the Israeli behind the scenes involvement which was setup but never finished and more on the reasons and plans of the bad guys; instead we had more plane and helicopter fighting. If you are into planes and shoot them up, it is a good read, but I would not recomend it to serious readers."
4,Excellent Word Wrangling,"Huston's novel is an excellent read. Though the ""letter of reprisal"" concept is a bit far-fetched, the author does an excellent job of creating a believeable Constitutional Crisis and an excellent action novel. The characters are real, the action is described well, and you can almost feel the planes lurching, gliding, and zooming into action. I heartily recommend this book as well as Balance of Power.The legal wrangling ADDED to this novel's value for me, it did not detract."
3,I Was Dissapointed!,I was hoping for a book with more action than talk. This book failed to qualify. You had all of the elements to create an action packed book. A group of assasins who were being protected by Iran and Syria. This group had as it's main target Americansand Israelis. With the exception of a few incidents this book did not deliver what I had hoped for. The action in the book never reached it's true potential. Too much time was tied up inuseless dialogue that seemed to drag on forever. Much of the book turned out to be this way. A potentially good plot gone to waste. Maybe James Huston will do better next time.
1,"9"" Extreme Athletes Falcons - Vick",This is definitely not an action figure that kids can play with. As soon as your move his legs they both fall off and don't stay in their sockets well.
4,Second Time Around,"This is the second time that I have ordered this book. The first time I ordered for my family (approximately 23 years ago), and the second time as a gift. My husband and I have an only child who was reared with the use of this book. I let a friend borrow my first book because her three children lacked discipline. Unfortunately for me she never returned the book. With the use of the internet you can compile scriptures that is suited for every occasion and keep them in a notebook. It will not cost as much as this book which I think it is really pricey considering. I gave four stars because of the cost factor. One big plus - hardcover and nicely bound."
1,real stinker,"Great idea, my son loves Spidey. But it simply didn't work, even after exchanging for a new one. Even if it did work, when it does you still need an external seperate VCR to record, it has no internal recording capability. And if you get that part to work, you have to stay close to the household VCR so it can get the signal. So you can't take it anywhere.I reccomend that for $10 to $20 dollars more you can get the real thing, a working video camera for kids - There are 2 from different companies available, the VCam Now, or the Vidster."
5,Where Was This Book When I Was Learning XML?,"Finally a handy book that clearly explains XML and XSLT from a FileMaker perspective.It is obvious when reading through this material, that Beverly Voth writes from experience. Her book is well researched, has a firm grasp of the FileMaker XML grammars and provides lots and lots of examples that make it easy for a developer to adopt this technology.This book is full of useful tips, hints and clear explanations. There are many simple step by step exercises, XML and XSLT examples along with many do's and dont's that take the pain out of the development cycle.The guide is complete with a useful list of resources, links and references and a glossary of acronyms and terms.I use FileMaker applications everyday, I write stylesheets and now I always keep this book next to my computer as a quick reference and useful guide."
5,My New Favorite CD!!,"This remastered edition makes Telekon my new favorite CD!! The original Telekon is an excellent album, but the extra tracks on this CD (even the instrumental ones) make it even more amazing!!! Plus, if you only have the American edition of this album (on the ATCO label), you'll get an additional new song--the UK edition track ""Sleep By Windows,"" which is worth the CD price in and of itself!! If you were disappointed by the mediocre extra tracks on The Pleasure Principle remastered CD (I sure was), don't worry. The remastered Telekon will blow you away!!!"
3,"A good album -> 3,5 stars",In the beggining I didnt like this album. But i hear it some times and now i can say that Im between its just ok and i like it. The production is average (i don't have a sense of bass) but the vocals and the guitar are good. Here are not the great solos as they were in their albums - the solos here are too average and too little. There a re no tracks to make the difference except lest say divine intervention and 213 (a little better than the other tracks). If you are new to Slayer check out Seasons in the abyss and South of Heaven which are their best albums.
5,"Fast, hard, and brutal as hell","This was Slayer's first album with Paul Bostaph and immediately you could see the differences. Slayer didn't sell out, not by a long shot if anything they became angrier and they really pumped up the speed for this album. Their previous two albums (south of heaven, seasons in the abyss) were more mature and slow while this album is just all-out intensity. Tom Araya's vocals are unreal on this album he sounds like a beast roaring out demonic words. The best songs on this CD are ""Killing Fields"", ""Dittohead"", ""213"", and ""Serenity in Murder""."
5,"Great book, Thrilling ,edge of seat.can't put down!!!!","The book was hard to put down, from start to finish. This book showed a look into a differant world of the mentaly ill, and how they could vewie the cruel world. I loved the part about the Doctor.And what Happen to him. Sharron could have been a little smarter, But them the book would have not been as good as it was. Is there more on the way. By Hall."
3,A Sunday Morning listen.......,"Overall a good record, but you won't take to it after your first listen - It's still too bad people don't understand the Crowes and their work. They incorporate more sounds and styles of music than anyone else today - A lot of talent out on a limb touching upon funk and jazz, with their focus remaining on that killer classic blues and gospel sound........"
1,Dissappointing Effort,"Black Crowes are nothing without decent songs. The swagger and feel is there but not the songs. Get ""Shake"" and ""Southern Harmony"" and end it there. This one and ""Amorica"" are downright boring."
5,Amazing,"I'm buying these tunes again on an audio cd. The first time I bought in the90's on a cassette. Needless to say I wore it out! I played that tape to death,and remember loving those songs, so after a long separation, I'm buyingthem again so I can listen to them again and again. I can't praise thisset enough, great guitars, vocals, just fantastic rock and roll old style.Def. one of the best albums/cd ever made."
1,It dosn't work when I want to use it.,"I'm from china , when I get this is about 1 month.It's a big trouble to send back this,this thing makes me never want to buy anything from this brand."
3,A good digital camera with frustrating flaws,"Bought the camera in Dec 1998 and, after several months of use, have found two problems. The camera will not allow you take night photographs even with the built in shutter adjustments; the shutter will simply not take the picture and allow you to decide whether it is useable or not. Secondly, the plug in cable from the camera to the PC is very sensitive (am on my third one)and at times I have to hold the input plug on the camera firmly during the download or it will stop the transfer. The upside...great pics and this camera takes standard close-up, telephoto or wide-angle lenses."
3,Beautiful book except there are not 6 colors in a rainbow!,"I would agree with everyone that the story and illustrations are wonderful. Both my 2 year old and 5 year old son also love the ribbons of color that run through the book. They also like the pop-up rainbow at the end of the book, and this has had to be taped back a few times as it's much too delicate for forceful little hands. I am only giving this book 3 stars though, as according to this book there are only six colors in a rainbow. I don't understand why the author did not add a seventh color and make the book accurate. When reciting and drawing the colors in a rainbow, your children will probably get this wrong if they believe what they read in this book."
3,"cute concept, but inaccurate","I picked this book up in the bookstore and loved the way the ribbons added a rainbow color with every turn of the page. Comments convinced me to modify this review to eliminate my objections to the colors of the rainbow as presented in the book. However, I still have a problem with the pop-up at the end which shows the rainbow with the sun glowing behind it...impossible!I also have to agree with another reviewer: this book can be too wordy for its target audience.And one more gripe...why is it that every male character in this book is addressed with the honorific 'Mr.' but not one of the female characters is given a similar honorific? This bias is not the sort of thing I want to find in a children's book. Or any book."
1,Nice idea but bad science!,"This book is a delight for young children to read as the rainbow appears. But it ignores the science of rainbows by merging two distinct colors -- indigo and violet -- into a single purple ribbon. There was no need to do this, and the result is that children learn about rainbows but learn the wrong thing. Why wasn't it made with the correct seven colors versus only six?"
4,Great collection,"The movies are all top quality, with many more special features than I would have expected in such an old collection. There are a lot of outtakes, bloopers, deleted scenes, screen tests, and mini-documentaries.A special bonus is a longer documentary on The Nutty Professor disc which goes into the chronology of Lewis' solo career. Lewis himself is interviewed heavily.The only disappointing thing is that the audio commentary by Lewis and others on the discs is quite sparse. So much time had passed between the original filming and the commentary that much of what we hear is their laughter at the funny parts, or the odd, ""Oh, this was a great scene."" The commentary doesn't add a whole lot to the collection.That said, there is enough other bonus material - not to mention the timeless movies themselves - that this collection was very much worth the purchase.MAAAAAAA!"
4,The Bellhop,This collection is a must for Jerry Lewis fans - a delightful return to the days when comedy was clean and presented by talented people.
2,Bit dated but good,Bought for a class....it's a bit dated but OK. If you've been photographing a while probably not much new here.
1,120 Days of Boredom,"Since two of my favorite filmmakers name De Sade their source of inspiration and admit his influence (Luis Bunuel quotes ""120 Days of Sodom"" in his ""Age of Gold"" and Jan Svankmajer was inspired by his writings in his brilliant ""Conspirators of Pleasure""), I decided to read ""120 Days of Sodom"". I tried. I really did and I went through first forty or so pages of ""120 Days of Sodom"" but it should be called ""120 Days of Boredom"". I stopped. I could not read it because it is not the novel really rather a catalogue of disgusting. The main characters have been introduced in the beginning as the fully developed monsters. Their victims just stayed that - the victims. There is no plot, no intrigue, and no development, just the endless loop of rapes, tortures, and murders. Yes, I understand that it is a satire and the absolute power corrupts absolutely but reading the book is a torture of boredom. Did I miss anything?"
1,120 Days of Sodom,I enjoy reading erotica and most forms of S&M but I found this book to be beyond my imagination in a disturbing way. The content of this book may not be everyone's idea of a sexual turn on.
2,DeSickest. Would have made Bob Flanagan wince.,"It was out of curiosity that I read this book. The ban on Pasolini's film was only lifted in NZ earlier this year (I haven't seen it because none of my local video stores have it). THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM is the most depraved book I have ever read. It's undeniably fascinating though, and incredibly pretentious and poorly written. If you want S&M, coprophagia, necrophilia, bestialily, pedophilia, blasphemy, oozing abscesses, deformity you name it, it's here. On first reading it's shocking, but if you skim through it again it loses its shock value and is mostly boring. I guess if I could I'd give it two and a half stars."
2,120 Days of Mindless Dribble!,"A Missunderstood Genius? A rebel against religious tyranny? Hardly! De Sade didn't care about religion! He wasn't some rebel trying to make the world more free for the masses. He was simply putting his own disturbed fantasies to paper. Half of them people we call insane and are in institutions right now are no where near as mad as this man whom we call a is understood genius! This book is actually written in the form of a list, detailing the daily (repetative) events taken on by a group of perverse people. I do however give him credit for being origional with this mess of a plot. Each time, he does think of some disgusting obsenities no one else would have thought of. But, is that a good thing? The story is basically the bio of this woman who entertains the rest of these fools by telling them her life story. Listen to this charactors life story and compare it to his book Juliette. Alike much?"
5,A must for all intercessors!!!,"I have read this book three or four times throughout the last 5 years. Everytime I pick it up, the Lord reveals something new to me. As an intercessor this book has proven to be a vital tool in prayer. If you are a prayer warrior, read this book."
5,I LOVE THIS MUESLI,"Familia Low-Fat Muesli, 21-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)TERRIFIC CEREAL...WILL DEFINATELY PURCHASE AGAIN..."
4,Not a good seat for cats,"While it worked, this was a great scanner. The drivers worked fine in Win2k with Adobe Photoshop. No complaints. Then the cats decided the scanner was a nice seat near the window. Within weeks, the scanner started making funny grinding noises and finally died today. Just ordered the Canon 8800F from Amazon and I'm going to build a frame to go over it for the cats to sit on. Hopefully it will then last forever.I was doing some pretty heavy scanning toward the end and it seemed to be holding up fine. Got it used from a friend for a very low price. So it served me very well for a very long time. Mainly used it at 150dpi/grayscale for documents and 300dpi color for photos.If you have cats, beware."
2,outdated software,The scanner works great.. but not with windows XP... i am trying to get my computer to recognize the scanner and get udated drivers ...no luck....going to get a new scanner as i tried the old sofware..and it didn't work... Any suggestions before i buy a new one
2,Pending : There Response,Scanner works fine as far as I could tell. Software was almost a desaster. Would not load properly error msg after error msg. Had to uninstall Software in order to shut down Windows 98
3,just OK,"The picture quality is good though it's just a CIS scanner, not a CCD scanner. And it's noisy, but really a good choice for webpage maker."
3,Brightness/Contrast Problems and Torn Ribbon Cable,"Overall I am very impressed with this scanner. For the money, you get an outstanding USB scanner in a small platform. I must concur with prior comments that pictures do not always turn out well. I have to always have Paintshop Pro automatically adjust the brightness and contrast to get any scanned photo to look halfway decent. I also have had to send my scanner back in for service because the ribbon cable attached to the scan head got tangled up repeatedly as the scan head moved back and forth. It finally ripped the cable. The cable sits on a tiny ledge and can easily slide to the side during the scan into a ""deep pit"" which then allows the scan head to mangle the cable. Not sure if this problem is unique to my scanner only. Customer support was great and I am now waiting for my scanner to return."
1,This Book is Terrible,This is quite possibly one of the very worst books I have ever read.Save your money on this one
5,Killer Show,"The review written two below this one is more of a polemic against Hunter than a proper assessment of this program, Mark Twain paraphrase notwithstanding. In fact, SOLO Inventions is a wonderfully crafted show, well-shot and a fine showcase for Hunter's unique talents. Highly recommended."
1,ONLY 1 GOOD SONG,"LUV ME, LUV ME, BY SHAGGY & janet is the only good song, in my opinion. Maybe you should just get the single."
4,Wall Clock Gift,"I would have given this product 5 stars had the ""wood"" been actual hard wood. It is beautiful in appearance . The hands and the face of the clock add to the beauty of it. It was a Christmas gift and the recepient was very pleased with it. This time piece keeps excellent time. Newsong77"
3,"Good Quality Printer, but beware if you need compatibility!","The HP 710C is a very good quality printer, most of my output looks as if it was laser printed. Its quick and fast and inexpensive, although I haven't had to buy a new cartridge yet. However although it looks like a standard inkjet printer it is different in a very important way, it uses a protocol called PPA (performance Printing Architecture) This is a very non-standard and has a few disadvantages. You can't network this printer, it loads my computer making it slow down dramatically whenever I try work and print at the same time (this is because windows does most of the work in the background because the printer has less memory and on-board intelligence then usual), Also if you want to use it an anything other than Windows (i.e LINUX) you cant!).Overall a good buy for an exclusively windows PC without networkability."
1,GNATS GNATS GNATS,"If you want to breed gnats, this is the perfect soil for you. Once watered, this soil is CRAWLING with them. I will never buy this soil again."
1,The worst results ever!,"This is the worst soil that I have ever purchased in all my years of gardening. There were rocks in this mix,a rubber band, to many wood chips, bugs, and the PH is off the Richter scale. All of my Tomatoes began to turn yellow almost immediately and eventually died. I currently decided to dish out the extra money for fox farm ocean forest and I encourage any serious gardener to do the same."
5,Everything I wanted it to do,This Dish Carving bit does exactly what I wanted and needed it to do. Such a time saver. You need to plunge the bit slowly in hard/dense wood or it will chip out. Smooth running and very agressive.
2,Mostly useless,"All us Lynch fans have most of this stuff already. The only selling point is the Mystery Disc and the Industrial Symphony, which has finally been transferred to DVD(please, sell this as a stand-alone item!). Not worth the huge price tag."
1,Key Ring has Flawed Functionality - Do Not Buy.,"This review relates to the product named ""50 Steel Split Rings Key Chain Connector Parts 20mm"", sold by FindingKing.I should have taken note of the review by Brian Hughes dated June 10, 2010. I had the same experience as Brian.The metal quality lacks sufficient tensile strength for its intended use.Once a key has been put on a ring, the ring is permanently deformed.Exactly as Brain Hughes stated ""... they end up sprung -- the layers don't spring back together ..."".At any price this product is defective. Amazon should delete this product from its website. Why does Amazon allow this defective product to stay on its website for 18 months?"
3,After 100 pages cartridge starts printing mostly red,"After a lesser amount of printed pages than advertised, cartridge starts printing mostly in reddish color and blurred."
2,Again?,"""Guncrazy"" is a mediocre movie at best, unfortunately. However, if you want to see a 17-year old Drew in (yet again) sexual situations (none of which are good), then this is the movie for you. It combines the ""I married an ex-con"", ""I like guns"", and ""I'm a sexually troubled girl"" plots into yet another movie.Directed by Tamra Davis, who made at least one pretty good movie (""Skipped Parts""), she is not totally without talent. The movie was written by Matthew Bright, who wrote ""Freeway"" a few years earlier, so he has talent as well. Included are Drew Barrymore, Ione Skye and a couple other notable names, however, they display no real talents here.I guess the dialog is the weakest link. Some of it just sounds bad or out of place.There are no extra features. You could do worse, but not by much."
1,Too big for my 4.5 lb. Yorkie!,"These are probably ok but supposedly I was ordering the ""small"" size ones and they are HUGE! My Yorkie can't enjoy them at all. Will give to my GrandDog. Need to advertise these better!"
4,Arising from the ashes,"of tonystark is Synthetic 16. And, it's another case of addition by subtraction. The group is at once the best bits of the former entity (3 of 5 members), but is also better with the addiiton of Mike Trzesinski and (a bit later) Adam Northrup.The music is strong and melodic with New York/New Jersey power pop harmonies. It's also got a twinge of hippie dreamy to it; I was reminded from time to time of Neil Young and Crazy Horse in their Amerian Stars and Bars/Zuma period.Regarding my rating...they deserve more than a 4! It's really a 4.5 to 4.75 CD!"
3,"Remixes only, NOT a compilation of their hits","I love the original singles by this group, but these remixes miss the mark for the most part. Most are extended to 5 to 7 minutes and remixed by various people. The Visconti remixes are the best, but none of the songs are as good as the original versions. I was very disappointed. On the back of the CD in big letters is ""NOT A COMPILATION""; too bad I didn't see that on the Amazon page. Guess I should have looked at the back pic of the CD there. It's not bad, but lots of filler and repetitious rifts that go on and on. The singles are slower and sections of songs are missing. ""Marcia Bailla"" isn't bad, but it can't hold a candle to the original French version (or even the English version, which wasn't as good as the French version). I'm disappointed."
3,Interesting for basic DM concepts but a little bit old now,This book gives you a good overview of the basic methods of Data Mining. The software is still working even if PRW is no replaced by Affineum Model from Unica or Model 1 from Group 1.This book should now need a new version up to date on these new tools.
4,Simple and Effective,"`I'm impressed by the way that this book forces you to really explore what you want and why. You feel the author is your partner as you progress through the book and you get a real sense of his support along the way. As someone who often reads this type of book straight through, i.e. without stopping to complete any exercises, some of the questions really made you stop and think. This book is described as' a simple and effective formula for success' and I couldn't agree more. `"
2,Deflated immediately,"The balloon held enough helium to last through the party (it was inflated an hour before the party started), but by the next day, it was floating near the ground. My husband purchased two more Elmo mylar balloons when he took this one to be filled, and both of them are still floating (a week and a half later). Also, the balloon arrived with a packing slip/receipt that was printed on a label. Part of the label backing was missing, so it was stuck to the balloon. When I peeled it off, the ""paint"" on the balloon came off with it. :/ Hopefully my experience was a fluke because this is a cute balloon."
4,A mixture of classic and contemporary,An amazing combination of classical composing and contemporary feeling. The smooth but dramatic strings are transportive.
4,Good collection,It came early and was in good shape. The movies were fun to watch. Not much else I can say about this product.
4,Great game for kids/families,"This game has been a hit in every setting we've shared the game, including my own two children, but I'm also a Youth Group leader and have pulled out the game on trips, retreats, etc. It's easy to learn for all ages. The concept is much like the card game War, so one minute you can have many cards and 5 minutes later you are loosing. It's also easy for kids to beat adults, since they tend have better focus and quicker speed to slap the pile of cards. The small tin case is also handy for travel and a nice way to keep the cards together. Don't need to worry about a box breaking apart."
3,Love the game not the damage,This game is one my daughter wanted and I thought it would be fun to purchase in the lunch box. Unfortunately on opening the lid of the lunch box was not correctly attached. The small piece of metal that connects the lid to the rest of the box was not inserted correctly and the lid detached on one side.
5,The Best Book i read,"This book was the best, becouse of many things, she was not only in the T.V show I LOVE LUCY and not only in movies, but she was a great landy that helped and cared for many people around the world. So i am telling you to read this book."
1,"Do You Love Lucy? If Yes, Do NOT Read this Book!","Lucie Arnaz herself said this book is full of false statements.The information is wrong and way off. There is a picture in there that says ""Lucy trying to make it in New York, in early modeling days"", and it shows a woman with no top on. Lucie Arnaz said that it is not Lucy, it doesn't even look like her. If Lucille Ball could see that she would be very embarrassed. If you want learn about the true life of Lucille Ball read Love,Lucy the one and only autobiography of Lucille Ball told straight from her heart."
3,Likeable Characters,"A good read for the middle school groups. If you like some suspense with a hint of horror, Ghost Abbey is your cup of tea. Some of the British dialogue Westall uses interrupts your reading experience; but, you get used to it quickly. The characters and the atmosphere are the strong suits of this novel. I appreciate the practical decision Maggi makes at the end of book."
5,Good physiology fundamentals and detail,Lots of figures. Easy to understand format that gives you what you need to know about physiology in the most concise format. Skips the extra stuff. Supplement with a good histology and anatomy book for vet school.
4,Wonderful cookbook,"Even if you do not have access to an ""organic"" store this book is a great recipe resource and also provides easy low cost ways to begin organic.One of the best things about the book is that the foods are quite different from what you would find in the store or at most restuarants and to see your child take to these foods (as well as you) is simply wonderful."
1,Not healthy,I think that whoever is writing a cookbook for kids should have a background in nutrition and should consider teaching kids to have a healthy eating habits. If you want your child to have good eating habits when he/she grows up this book isn't for you.
3,Beautiful cookbook but not very informative.,This is a gorgeous cookbook and looks to have some yummy recipes but it doesn't have much information in it about preparing your own baby food. ORGANIC BABY would be best to supplement other baby food cookbooks or for someone planning on preparing only occassional meals for the infant/toddler.
2,Good idea but disapointing,"I was excited to get this book and try the recipes. Not only is it filled with conflicting advice, there aren't enough pictures of the process and finished product. I have tried several of the recipes and have found them all to be failures. The proportions seem off. Over all I am very disappointed and would not recommend. It's a beautiful book to look at, but not as practical as I had hoped."
3,Recipes are worth it!,"I bought this book hoping to find some fresh ideas for feeding my kids. Bingo. The recipes are fabulous, and definitely worth the $ paid for the rest of the book. I found the book itself to be very preachy about buying organic, which I found odd because chances are if you buy this book, you are already buying organic. As it is, I do not shop organic, and the book certainly did nothing to particularily sway me in that direction.I guess the bottom line is to skip the filler in this book and head right to the recipes- you won't be disappointed."
5,Authors introduction to the book,"Hi! I wrote the book to introduce new parents to the delight of feeding their children tasty combinations of healthy ingredients that are combined in ways to make sure they get the nutrients they need. At Baby Organix we've always followed a philosophy of 'The Parent has a Right to Know what they are feeding their Child' so here's our contribution to how to make babyfoods - its so simple!As well as the recipes there are chapters about how to buy, store and prepare organic ingredients, and menu planners and child development information. I've tried to make it fun and informative about organic food as well as appealing with lots of food values and cooking tips. I hope you enjoy it.I'd welcome all your comments about the recipes and any other way in which the book could be improved. ...."
4,"Is a good read, but...","...not what I expected. The first half is pretty much a huge history lesson on the delevopment of Deaf schools & ASL, and although it was interesting at parts it seemed to drag for awhile. Then it gets more into current issues in Deaf culture but still dabbles in the history at times.I would not say that the book is ""bad"" at all. It's just I was expecting more scenerios concerning: behaviors, Deaf opinions on hearing, changes in technology/communication, etc. I too believe it is a necessary read for those hearing who want to learn ASL. It helps you appreciate the culture much more and helps you to not look at Deaf people as handicapped."
5,good stuff!!,This tea is one of my favorites. It's a great flavor to give comfort when it's cold outside and if you serve it chilled it makes a great refreshing summer drink. Highly recommend for parties!!
3,good printer for the price,This is a pretty good printer for the price..The only down sideI have seen so far is that it uses a lot of ink.I have had mine for 3weeks and already ran out of ink.Besides that problem I haven't seen any other problem with it.It prints beautful cards.
2,A SORRY buy Canon BJC-2000,"The printer worked very well- untel to was used for 2 years- & 36 days. Than the ability to print--just QUIT. I was proud of my printer. It seems that Canon was not as Proud of thier product as they should have been The replacement part, the printer head-was more expencive than the price of the printer was NEW ! They sure got then selves a BAD NAME----from me."
2,Cheap printers are ink-eaters.,"The Canon 2000 is a splendid worker: efficient, speedy, and compact. Its difficulty, and that of all inexpensive printers, is that it consumes the alcohol-based ink at an alarming speed. The on-line businesses which specialize in re-filling inkjet cartridges are quite correct: consumers may spend $69 on a printer, and over $400 a year on ink. Better to get a more expensive printer which conserves ink? Your move."
2,A good but short life,"I have had mine a little over a year, and while it did great at printing both in black and in color (the output of photo-type documents was grainy at best), I had habitual problems with the printer not printing in black. It would go through all the motions, and even replacing the ink tank and print head did not fix it. Canon's advice was to take it to a service center, which led me to the ""it's cheaper to buy a new one than to fix it"" situation. Printheads, at $52 or so each, don't last as long as I had hoped either. Not a bad printer, and maybe you will not have the problems mine has, but I must believe there are better on the market"
3,A pleasant enough read,"This is the first book of a trilogy set in the Age of Conan (King Conan even makes a very short cameo riding by in the book). The main plot is that a young Pict must avenge the destruction of his tribe by an unscrupulous Aquilonian noble and regain a dangerous stolen artifact. There are 3 trilogies like this (9 books total) and I have now read the first book of all three of them. I would say that none of them would be mistaken for a Howard story, but overall I liked this book best of the three I have read so far. In the Howard stories Picts generally only show up long enough for Conan to split their skulls to the teeth, so its nice to learn more about them.I would say that ""Legends of Kern"" has more exciting fight scenes, and ""Anok, Heretic of Stygia"" has more interesting characters, but this one is the best all around."
4,A good CD . . . but a little rushed,"When I heard Shola's first album, I was captivated by the smooth, flowing vocals and the sweet r'n'b sound. So of course I bought her second album straightway.This album features some really good tracks, like 'That Thing' and 'Can't Have You' and of course 'Imagine' with a new, funk sound. But some of the slower songs really let Shola down - songs like 'Superficial Fantasy' don't possess any kind of sparkle to make them really memorable. Shola's voice is up to scratch, but the production of this album isn't. However, for some nice background music this album is great. Just a few songs on the album let it down, with a boring tune and frankly terrible music. Shola's voice is sweet as always.In conclusion - an album that was obviously rushed, and you can hear it. A good CD - but not a great one."
2,Not thrilled...,"After reading the first 3 chapters of this book, I've closed it for now and am moving on to another book I purchased that I'm finding much more helpful. This book reads like a professor's lecture notes and handouts - choppy - then some parts are way too basic for anyone who's ever worked as a counselor. Some of the information is helpful if you can follow the unwritten connections, or if you need a list of questions or a checklist as guidance. I may come back to other chapters for such resources, but I'm glad it's not my only guide."
4,Great fit for an 18' pool,"I bought this for our 18 ft. Intex round pool. It fits great within the inflatable ring and helps hold the heat in at night. One night we forgot to put on this cover and lost 2 degrees of heat. It doesn't sound like much, but every degree counts in our family."
1,REALLY,I purchased this item to heat pool for my granddaughter. When I opened it I was quite surprised to find out that it is just a large piece of blue bubble wrap. There is no way to secure to the pool to insure child safety at all.
2,"Not a ""cover""","When I purchased this product I was looking for a replacement cover for my pool. I came across several options including solar ""blankets"" which I thought might be nice since we have such a short summer season where we are but I didn't want to buy a cover AND a solar blanket at this time. Then I saw the ""Solar Cover"". I enlarged the photo and read the description but was still under the mistaken impression that this was a cover and not a blanket. It's a blanket. Now I still need to buy the cover. I don't know at this time how well the blanket works, if at all, because apparently our warm season is over already, but I feel like I was mislead by the name of this product and didn't receive what I thought I had ordered."
5,Great product,"This is a good buy if you have kids and use the pool alot!. Yes its basically bubble wrap dyed blue, but it works!, and it fits inside the pool perfectly. I cover up the pool every evening and if left on the next day while its a hot day 85- 95 degrees the water temp is about 3 -4 degrees warmer. it makes the water 82-86 degrees, even warmer if its a HOT day and you leave the cover on all afternoon. Ive taken it off and on on my own, but It's easier if two people do this. I'm hoping it will do well in storage, until next summer, I've read other reviews that it ripped, we'll see. It's also a great price, $30 something. If you have kids and a 15ft pool, this is a good investment."
3,pool cover,"thought this would wrap around the outside edge, instead it just floats around on top, it works ok, needs 2 people to put on."
1,Very poor quality and not what is pictured!,The product I received is not the product pictured. I've had Intex solar covers in previous years and they are strong and durable. This is not an Intex solar cover. The product I received is very cheap very thin blue bubble wrap with an Intex sticker somewhere near the middle. Very disappointed and feeling ripped off! Will never buy from this seller again!
2,Not durable,"I bought this last year -used it for 3 months in summer, stored in dry place for winter. It does do a nice job keeping the poole warm. However, this year the cover is disintegrating fast and we also are having the hundred little plastic blue disks clogging our pool. I wouldn't expect it to last forever, but 5 months seems a little unreasonable. Cheaply made."
1,Why so famous?,"I think that the world has one big question to answer. The question is: Why the hell is Funkmaster Flex so famous. Not only that his scratches aren't anything but a big joke, he isn't able to do any blends or good backspins at all. The tracklist might be interesting when you want stuff everybody listens to or if you were hit on the head a few years before so you aren't capable of understanding lyrics with more than 3 words.Watch out for DJ A.Vee-Mixtapes but better save your money when you see a Flex-Album in stores unless you like to listen to a dj clearing his throat every two minutes."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with the first reviewer. Papa has so much promise on DVD. His voice and personality shine during his live performances and on CDs. He is simply incredible. This DVD, however, disappoints almost completely. Its only high spots are the few professionally made music videos in the extras section. The main concert footage is energetic, but generally raw, disorganized and the sound quality is abysmal. Papa, take a look at Baaba Maal or Youssou N'Dour to see and hear how professional video makers ply their craft. You can do it Papa. We're all waiting and will support you."
3,A good starting point but...........,"This is the book everyone buys and it is a good place to start the college search. However, for a book with such a reputation, it should not have typos and blatant errors. For example, they list the in-state tuition at William and Mary at $1880 a year. Granted it is a pretty big book, but it shouldn't be that hard to proofread. I had bought an earlier edition several years ago when my older child was looking at colleges and bought the 2004 edition this year for my younger one. I was a little disappointed that a lot of information was identical, especially in the student comment section, which leads me to believe that the information is outdated.All things considered though, it is one of the better guides."
4,"A world long lost, twice removed from our own...","Noel Coward's homage to the bygone era of Edwardian England. A long and somewhat lumpy script tracks one upper-upper class family's trials through 1899-1933, as their paths intersect the Boer War, WWI, and the Titanic... Oddly enough, considering Coward's bon vivant temprament, the movie seems to condemn the libertine sensibilities of the Jazz Era (great glimpses of the action, though, including a gay couple exchanging gifts in a nightclub...) and exalts the more traditional English reserve. An interesting film, although in retrospect WWII loomed large in the background..."
4,An intimate portrait!,"This familiar album extends itself from 1899 to 1932,in this sense the movie focuses around the painful years of the WW1 and the Great Depression. The sorrows and triumphs of the Marryot family are treatedadmirably in this admirable adptation of Noel Coward's play.The film looks dated but maintains its involving expressive force.This can be Frank Lloyd's masterpiece."
2,"DIDN""T WE JUST SEE GAMBIT?","Marvel Legends has a Gambit figure already. And, despite its shortcomings, it was done reasonably well. Why produce him again under the X-Men Classics series (which are the same scale)?? And then, accessorize him with a disk shooter?? More proof that ToyBiz lacks an intelligent marketing staff. The only thing this figure has over the Marvel Legends figure is the jacket. It's molded as part of the figure and not a seperate piece of shabby clothing. It does add to the figure's appearance and makes it look real sharp. Great for an X-Men fan or collector...or someone who just can't get enough of Gambit."
5,Angie Debo's home town,"We have both read ""Prairie City"" and were enthralled with Angie's story of the settlement of a small Oklahoma town, especially since we do not live to far from Marshall, Oklahoma, the community the book is based on. We were encouraged to read this book when it was selected by our local library as their ""One Community, One Read"" event this year. All we can say is WOW, and would encourage everyone with an interest in early history to read it."
2,Almost Empty ink tank,"This cartridge with tank came with my printer when I purchased it and if I didn't know better (the box had never been opened and was tightly sealed) I would think that it had been used. It does not print up to 80 pages unless the pages are only partially full. In fact, it was empty by the time I got finished printing one three page letter and about another 5 or 6 pages from a web site. Ten or 12 pages is all I got before it was empty. I thought there was something wrong with my printer and didn't even realize, at first, that the the color was gone as I had never experienced this before. One will go broke buying ink tanks and cartridges for Canon's BJC80, 50 and other small, portable printers and they are expensive in themselves. I wish I'd never bought it as it's always, always out of ink and never available when I need it."
2,Worked great for about 2 years,"It worked great for about 2 years and then stopped working... it still turns on but wont kick anything out. Overall, not satisfied. Who want's to deal with returning it? I tossed it in the trash, I'll be buying another Humidifier NOT of the Sunpentown name brand."
2,"First device great, second one not so much. Bad customer service.","This cold mist humidifier is one of the best humidifiers we purchased. No filters to clean, straight-forward use, and generally super-quiet. We have the first one since about 5 years, and no problems whatsoever. The second unit we purchased last fall. About 4 weeks into the operation, the fan started to make a louder noise, typical for a failing bearing. Any attempt of contacting Sunpentown's service department was unsuccessful. One of the 4 service numbers printed on the device connects to a private phone number, it seems, and the other numbers are either not picked up, or when leaving a message, the call is not returned. I have never reached a live person. So make sure you have good warranty where you don't have to contact Sunpentown for service."
4,Humidifier,"Unit performs well, We had a problem after about 15 days with LOW output. After contacting the manufacturer, the base unit was replaced. The customer service experience with Sunpentown was very good. Recommendation is positive."
1,Deceiving,"Initially I thought the SU-2000 was great, except for filling. After a few days of use, I had white dust all over the room, plus adjacent rooms. I know it says I can use distilled water, however this increases my operating cost and makes filling a two person job (one to hold the tank and one to pour in the distilled water. Even without the distilled water, filling is a difficult job. A balancing act to fill the inverted tank and keep level until securely capped. There must be better humidifiers without these drawbacks. Certainly not the appliance for a little old lady."
3,XMen Wolverine,Great looking figurine. Could not believe how realistic it looks. Have bought more from this Marvel line. I hope to see more Calssic figures to come
3,Adequate performance,"I took the portable printer on a two week trip. It definitely helped, however the print was just adequate. Maybe the print was better when the printer was new. Bottom line - it did the job."
1,Beware of older models!!,"The model of this printer that I got is so old that it does not have a USB port! My computer will not work with this printer b/c my computer will only take a printer with a USB port! Learn from my mistake (duh. . . !) I had no idea that this would be an issue. Beware!!!! If you want to buy a used one from one of these sellers, confirm how old the model is and that it has a USB port if you need one."
2,SOUND ENGINEER MISSING IN ACTION,"I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WIYH CROWD NOISE ON LIVE CD'S. ITS EITHER WAY TOO MUCH,AS IN THIS CASE , OR NON EXISTANT ON OTHER CD'S. IT SEEMS AS IF THE SOUND ENGINEER AND THE PRODUCER CANT FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. THE CHEERS ON THIS CD ARE, IN MY OPINION, ARE WAY OVER THE TOP. I THINK SADE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED RECORDING IN A SMALLER VENUE.IT SOUNDS AS IF SHE WAS THE SECOND COMING OF THE BEATLES LIVE.THE RECORDING ITSELF IS VERY GOOD HOWEVER IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CROWD NOISE WAS ADDED LATER. IVE BEEN TO OVER 300 CONCERTS AND HAVE NEVER HEARD THE CROWD FADE IN AND OUT ON CUE. BUY THE DVD IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHY THE CROWD MAKES NOISE.TO HEAR THE CROWD ERUPT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG MAKES NO SENSE ON THE CD"
3,"3 Stars only cause it's SADE, not cause this CD deserves it.","As a ""Live"" album this CD falls short. Sounds too much like her studio workings. A live album should offer what you've already given us (from the studio) in addition to a personal side fans are not ordinarily privy to. If you already own all of her albums then....you already have this CD. (minus the crowd roars of course)"
3,A Little Disappointing,"I am a huge Sade fan. Having seen the Lovers Live concert on DVD a number of times I thought it would be great to have an audio version so I could enjoy the same live versions in my car, on my mp3 player, etc. Well I guess I didn't read the description well enough. While this IS audio from that DVD concert, it's not ALL the audio. They've only included the songs from the concert that are on the Lovers Rock album! Not really what I wanted. If you're looking for the entire concert in this CD don't bother...it's not there."
5,Even better than the real thing...,"I was one of the lucky kids to see these California tour dates and I can tell you that the audience sat in silence, mouths agape. (Except for some fool in the back that professed his love between each song.)This album truly evokes my memory of that concert, yet it gives every listener the ability to go back, time and again, to their favorite parts of the night and replay them at will!"
5,Outstanding!,"This is an outstanding CD. What a marvelous artist Sade is.She has power, sensitivity and grace on stage! I highly recommend this collection of live songs. The DVD sounds good too."
4,Save,I like the feel of Latin American Gregorian chants. I love to listen to this music while I work. I feel very calm and balanced.
2,A wee bit dissapointing,"If you're looking for a bunch of Bon Jovi rock songs, then this album is for you. Unfortunately, their creativity has been waning since Crush and the most original song on the album is 'Who Says You Can't Go Home,' which I enjoed, but it is not great.As has been mentioned before, one of the band's greatest strengths is Richie Sambora. This album does best to under-utilize him, and it hurts the album.For pretty much every song on the album, you can find an older song that is very similar, and better done. Crush had a handful of unique songs, It's My Life at the time, Next 100 years, etc. Bounce less so, and this to the extreme. It's worth getting if you really love Bon Jovi, but it is nothing new."
5,"Great, but JBJ is a bit of a dandy.","Anybody agree?I mean this cat can sing and when he belts out ""Have a Nice Day"" I believe him. My soul believes him. My dog believes him. My dog thinks its people. And my dog has human emotions. Please don't PM me about dogs being animals and not being capable of the emotional range of humans even though their brains are a tenth the size of ours. I don't care. You don't know Fritters. So please don't comment on him.Anyway, if you're like me and you love to rock, then I would say this CD is full of anathemas to rock n roll. Good luck!"
3,Where's Richie?,"Bon Jovi built thier following up over 20 years playing guitar based rock and Richies playing was always the highlight of a Bon Jovi concert.The guitar solos were as much a part of the Bon Jovi sound as Jon Bon Jovi's voice. This album might as well be a Jon Bon Jovi solo album.With every release since Crush the guitar has become increasingly invisible, giving way to 3 minute pop songs filled out by orchestrated effects rather than blazing guitar. Have a nice day takes this to a new low where the guitar is so lacking in personality it could have been played by anyone.The redeeming feature for me was that my CD came with a live DVD where they sound more like the old school Bon Jovi than the middle aged mediocrity served up on the CD.I give 'Have a Nice Day' 1 star and the included DVD 5 stars..."
2,Eeeeeeeek!,"Well...where do I start.My favourite track has to be ""Unbreakable"" for its crunching guitar riff and the lyrics are reasonable.""Who says you can't go home"" It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It does well for all intended purposes...selling the album. Nice song.""Have a nice day"" Meh. Not very interesting to be honest.""Last Man Standing"" Oh dear oh dear. How hypocritical. ""Stuff your digital downloads"". So cliché. Also, a bit hypocritical of Jon Bon Jovi, who told us to ""Download our latest song and make it number one for only 1.50"". This song sucks. Really, really badly.Two stars for the fantastic guitar solos. The music is bad. The lyrics are bad. If you want descriptive, delicious music, get ""Cross Road"" and listen to ""Wanted Dead or Alive"". That is an example of Bon Jovi's potential. Compare this album with that song, and you will see which one rules."
2,BON JOVI MAILS ANOTHER ONE IN,"What can you say, this band knows exactly what their strengths are , and play to them. I am on track 4 right now and I Feel like I am listening to a combination of a Goo Goo Dolls album and a hybrid of ""Crush "" and ""Bounce"" (although so far I dont hear anything as rocking as Bounces ""Hook Me Up"")The reviews I see so far are all glowing - are there any fans out there who are clamouring for a 7800 Farenheit styled- CD? A REAL return to their roots? Ahh, wishful thinking....."
2,To much sap - not enough zap,"have a nice day is the only catchy tune on this album. bon jovi may be branching out musically but overall I thought this album was full of filler. just to many songs that try to sound sad and such but really cannot deliver any feeling of sadness, its just a soft, moping mess that to me is not even worth sharing the shadow of all the albums by this band that came before it."
3,Where had Bon Jovi gone?,"I have always loved Bon Jovi and after Bounce, I thought that ""Have A Nice Day"" would onlyfollow up and be greater than Bounce. I was wrong. This was more of Bon Jovi being more commmerical punk rockers. Have you ever heard American Rejects' ""Swing,Swing"" well Bon Jovi has about 3 songs on the new album that sound excatly like it. Where the he$$ are Bon Jovi's rock and i mean true driving rock and their ballads. Their ballads got me into this band and i always thought Jon Bon Jovi is one of the greatest song writers but this album is missing the all-important ballads. Bon Jovi needs to rebound quickly. there are about two gems on this cd"
4,Welcome back Bon Jovi,"It took me a little while to get into this CD. I bought it initially because I loved the duet with Jennifer Nettles. It took me listening to the albumn several times before I really came to appreciate the return of Bon Jovi. It's a good CD, and worth having in your collection. Unless you are a die hard Bon Jovi fan it may take you a couple of plays before you discover that you like it and it's worth owning."
3,"Not their best, not their worst","""Have a Nice Day"" is a solid if unspectacular rock CD. The sound doesn't veer away from what Bon Jovi has always been, melodic hard rock measured with some heartfelt and sometimes cheesy ballads. The songs here have good melodies and anthemic lyrics that are easy to sing along with. There isn't any soloing by Sambora anymore which is ashame but the songs still have a nice hard guitar sound. Some people are complaining that Bon Jovi doesn't rock as hard as they used to, but they were never a 'metal' band. They sound as loud here as they ever have. This is an experienced band that knows how to play and knows how to write a catchy rock song."
1,just another hair band who can't make a comeback,"yeah, this is another album that seemed enticing from its hit single but that I don't own, but why should I? Just about every song except for the kickoff anthem is not only corny and reheated but lazy, slow and ready to fall off its hinges before it finishes--and there's enough of them the band might as well register for a career suicide. so long, jon bon 'snoozy' (hey, that's what they are!)"
4,Raw London,"Sammy and Rosie Get Laid is a real picture of London in the mid-80. The story is based in a couple living in London during the clash between police and demonstrators. The unemployment was too high and there was the minorities, like coloured didn't have a chance for survive. Sammy and Rosie believe in free love and have lovers. The relantioship is based in free wheeling. Sammy has a father, Rafi, an former politician in India that moved to London. Rafi intends to live in London forever and find his mistress that he left 30 years ago. Rafi met Victoria (or Danny), a coloured man with no job. Victoria lives in a trailer and walks away. Sammy hates his father, but Rafi give his money to Sammy. Rosie is a feminist and supporter of lesbians, gays and unemployers. A real and raw London you cand find it with a great finale. Enjoy it!"
4,Good but restrictive,"I used this to replace a turnable 3 way valve. It works fine, but the flow is highly restricted. The channels could be bigger, but that's my only concern"
5,...and I mean 5 STARS,"Out of the nine books in this TimeLife series I've read so far this one is far and away my favorite. It is almost shocking to learn just how sophisticated the early Chinese were. Starting with the Song dynasty around 960 CE (Common Era) and ending with the death of the Mongol invander and emperor Khubilai Khan around the 14th century CE, this book gives readers a real treat filled with both intellictual and historical adventure. This book had no problem keeping my interest... I actually hated to see this one end!!!"
4,Ancient Curiosity,"Very interesting information related with historical perspectives and supported by tangible evidence. With settings and persepctives from many corners of the world and storeis from many different cultures, this set examines ancient alien legands and ideas up through future possabilities. A must for Alien enthusiests. Episodes are LONG, but can easily be broken into multiple sessions. Opposing viewpoints are a bit short, but the supplied viewpoints are from credible sources. I'm looking forward to getting the second season on DVD soon. Also, a significant companion piece to the UFO Hunters seasons, which are now available on DVD."
4,Great for the basics of Ancient Astronaut Theory,"If you know of someone who doesn't enjoy reading but wants to learn more about the ancient astronaut theory, then definitely fire up this DVD set. It contains all kinds of fascinating presentations and video of historic sites, ancient texts, and the interviews with experts in their field. Great for the basics but try to read some of the books too."
4,I am just wondering....,Why would anyone buy something that is played on TV every week for free? If they offered bonus material or a longer program I would see maybe but this has been on my tivo forever...why would anyone buy what they could record off tv?
5,Ancient aliens season 1,"This is one of my favorite shows of all time, the things that they show you in the series is incredible. Just waiting for season 2 to come out."
5,ancient aliens,"I enjoyed Ancient Alien's very much there is a lot of information about Ancient site's around the world the Sumerian's the mayan's,many more I do believe we have had help in the past but what about our current world I believe as we have grown as a civilization we probably told the Ancient Vistor's we don't want their help. This series will make you question history and really look with new eyes what were god's could have been visitor's from space everyday nasa is finding more knowledge about space and other planet's that could contain life like our self's it would be foolish to say we are the only life in the univerese Watch the series it's really well put together,the people who are discussing the Ancient Astronaut theory are serious proffesional's who know some people scoff at the idea of intellegent life beyond our planet earth. They have tooken there time and career's to share their information about Intellegint life in space."
5,Wildly Fascinating !! Opens your eyes...,"Crazy premise. Ancient space aliens coming to earth. But even the most skeptical will be intrigued by this tv series. Excellent production of some wild ideas, but put together in a very good, very interesting way.I appreciated the way they let the viewer decide. Like most History Channel shows, they predominantly present information and facts and ideas.This is one of my favorite series on TV.BIG THUMBS UP !!"
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENED,"This series about UFO's is the most complete I have ever seen! The investigations on this series is very well documented is amazing how they go around the world in the search to make sense of this type of phenomena. For those whom are related or intriguing for this type of information, this is a pretty good recompilation of data. And for those whom are just curios about it, this a great starting point to a world of mystery.Over an excellent research of the Alien-UFO phenomena HIGHLY RECOMMENED"
4,"Scientifically ridiculous, but utterly entertaining","Bought this dvd on a whim because it was $5 at a store. The series is now my secret indulgence. Scientifically, this series take massive inductive leaps from what is often minimal evidence. (I have only seen seasons 1 and 2, so far) Still they do it in a highly entertaining way, and for some reason, I just can't get enough of this show. It definitely makes you think. My main problem with the series is they introduce a piece of evidence, they introduce the traditionally accepted view and then they introduce the alien theory, when there may be some or many other possible solutions that fit. Still it is a show about Ancient Aliens, and they do put there ideas out there as theories or hypotheses. Overall entertaining, and I enjoy seeing the one guy with the supernatural hair."
2,cheap in quality and quantity,My class was instructed that we would be using this book and in our second semester the books began to fall apart. We also found that the amount of information was lacking. With permission from our classroom and clinical instructors we are being allowed to utilize the Merrill's Atlas of Radiographic Positions and Radiologic Procedures. This has been the learning tool of Technologists for years and we switched because some one came out with a cheaper product. Just remember you pay for what you get.
4,The Jesus Creed,My Sunday school class is using this book and it gives way to much discussion. It's a nice book to have in ones library
2,Questionable quality,"Granted, this is a dated painting, but I was not expecting this poor of quality. I didn't expect the print to actually have a printed frame around it, but thought it was simply an illustration. It does have a printed border, which makes it very difficult to frame but would probably be fine if you just want to hang on the wall as is. The print also appears to have been enlarged because it is very pixelated. I won't be hanging this up."
1,Loving Family Dollhouse Furniture and Accessories,Your Loving Family Doll House Furniture and Accessories are over priced. I was in a major retailer today and found most if not all the items on my wish list for $12.99 or less. And they were all new. You might want to think of lowering the prices of these items for a quicker sale. I absolutely love Amazon and I am always hyping your items to people. But its kind of hard to convince people with prices like these for children toys you can pretty much get anywhere what a great retailer you are. Thanks.
1,You get what you pay for...,"Compared to my Logitech Z-2200s, it's easy to see why these retail at about half the price.The wired remote only has a volume control unlike the 2200/2300 series which has a subwoofer volume control too, and that makes all the difference---this cheaper boomier subwoofer does tend to drown out the satellites, even when listening to jazz music let alone rock, rap, or game effects. The only thing that really sounds decent on this system is classical music...because it very seldom involves the subwoofer!If you're patient, Logitech will probably offer a rebate on its 2300 system just as it did for my 2200, which after rebate ended up costing a mere ten dollars more than this sorry Z-3e ""Premium"" (gag! chortle! choke!) system does with its current rebate."
2,"Slow, Starry, and Boring","I think every song on this CD is about stars, and that gets annoying real quick. Basically all of the songs are slow and are exactly the same. I bought this CD because I really like ""Counting Blue Cars"" from their last album and ""Once In a While"" from this one, but I can tell you that the songs get so boring that you'll never want to listen to this disc after the day you buy it."
1,No One's Even Bleeding,"Amateurish, badly written, heavy-handed, not in the least funny. The author has annoying habits - such as putting quotes around things he thinks to himself. Contrived, unstructured, overstated, plotless, full of irrelevant sexual detail ..."
2,Watch Boston Public Instead and Save Your Money,Not that fantastic of a book. Saw the reviews and figured I'd buy it. I really didn't like it very much at all. Far more entertaining stories exist. Save your money.
1,"Tell me, for a BP monitor, what is most important?","Your right! Accuracy. I have had this monitor for months and never, never! has it given me consistent, accurate readings. Did I say Never!? Example: three readings just now, each within 2 min. of each other 146/80 134/80 122/84. So which reading do I believe? Eh? Consumer Reports rated BP Monitors and LifeSource was at the end of their list. Really folks, get a better monitor. NOT Recommended."
5,Works great,Easey to use Accurate convient . This makes tracking your BP easey and no need to run to corner drug store to check..
3,"Good Performance, not that funny","Look, I'm a fan of the man's work. I'm glad he's around. I often agree with him. On this DVD he's insightful, thought provoking and entertaining. I'm just not sure he's all that funny.This show is even more of a polemic than ""Victory Begins At Home"". There seems to be less concern with constructing a joke (with a few notable exceptions) than talking about contrasting world views. Many of the punchlines seem kind of obvious once you're on Maher's train of thought.As for the bonus features, the Q&A; is a great idea (even though this one's not as good as the one on Victory Begins at Home). The behind the scenes section is basically an extended version of the opening credits with a bit more of the loony protester thrown in. (Am I too cynical in thinking that he was a ""plant""?)In recommend it, but don't expect to be rolling in the aisles with laughter."
4,Great Retrospective,"The Strawbs weren't as well known as some of the other progressive rock acts of the 1970's, but for my money, they were one of the better ones. Their music was firmly rooted in English folk, and the song writing was top-notch. They weren't trying to write rock symphonies like many of their contemporaries, the focus was always on the songs. Religious themes run through much of their music, and when these combined with the lush, mellotron enhanced arrangements of many of the songs, the effect could be quite majestic. On the down side, the almost unrelenting seriousness of the music could sometimes be depressing, and Dave Cousins voice was an acquired taste."
3,"MGM, please insert Annette's beautiful singing sequence!","I s saw this terrific beach film first on ABC the night before Thanksgiving, 1969. The famous ""I'll Never Change Him"" sequence was intact and made this then-teen boy fall in love with Dee Dee, sorry, Frankie. Then it was repeated and in 1971 our pre-Fox indie showed it. AMC AM Pop showed it in the 90s as well. When I recently borrowed a 2001 library, the sequence is strangely missing. Please reissue this movie even if MGM makes *that* sequence a bonus feature. Our beach darling is ill with MS and she would deserve a commemorative edition in her honor, even if Messrs. Ashley, Lembeck and Asher and Ms. Walley are deceased. My ten cents."
2,"Interesting and technical, but not much help for beginners","I purchased throwing techniques and decorating techniques from the same author and found both books to be wonderful. My skill level went far beyond what I could currently do in a matter of weeks using the techniques listed in the book. However, this book failed to impress me. The illustrations were nice, and it provides good detail for making and applying your own glazes, but unless you own your own set of kilns and have a workshop, this book is best to be borrowed from a friend or checked out from the library."
4,exactly what I was looking for.,All OK. Except it has no toner cartdrige.I expect the next time I'll buy a car to have to buy the tires separately.
2,Big Disappointment,"Bought this copier (via Amazon) about 2 years ago and almost from the start it printed very light, almost illegible copy. We did all the required cleanings and buffings and installing new cartridges but, in the end, I go to Staples. And getting through to Canon takes an act of the will, just waiting to be heard---and then they tell us to do what we have already done."
5,Easy to move,Copies well. Much less weight than old copier to move. Does not have all the features of the old copier but can use computer printer to expand or conract the original prior to mass copying.
4,4 snaps! LOL!,"I had to give this book four snaps! I loved it! I was first introduced to this book after reading and falling in love with Hot Tamara by the talented Mary Castillo. One of the writers of Friday night chicas. I did my research on the title as I always do before I purchase any book. I found out that they were 4 stories & 4 writers. More bang for my buck. LOL! I read the excerpt and liked was I saw. I went out and got it, read it and love it! I recommend this book to any one who would like to escape the monotony of the real world and add some spicy latin flava to their life."
3,Fun beach read (3 1/2 stars)...,"I wanted a good beach-read companion for a sunbathing session and Friday Night Chicas was the perfect choice. This saucy and super chic anthology features four fun, feisty novellas written by four up and coming Latino authors. The stories have the same premise of a modern and single career woman who meets Mr. Right during a night of cocktails and bar-hopping. All four novellas are enjoyable reads, but my two favorites are Mary Castillo's My Favorite Mistake and Berta Platas's Revenge of the Fashion Goddess. The other two novellas, Hearts Are Wild and The More Things Change, are also great and deserve their due. Are you in the bargain for some fun chick-lit beach read? Then you have got to give Friday Night Chicas a whirl!"
4,One person's opinion,"Harry Gann, who recently died, left the aviation community with a solid body of work. This book, in typical Gann fashion, punches through the veneer of the Tech series of books.On the surface, the series as a whole, promises much. In reality, they are at best inconsistant in presentation and information.In this book, Gann's genius is visible beneath the framework.Of the 8 books of this series which I own, this is the most comprehensive and direct presentation of the subject aircraft. Unlike others of the series, this book focuses on the topic at hand. The diversions into the minutia and one-offs are focussed and appropriate. If you want to know the history of the DC6 and DC7, you can't find a better starting point than this book.The point of this particular volumn is that it is hard to hold a good writer down. The documentation of aviation history suffered a great loss with Gann's passing."
5,Best of British,"Great family movie, and as I was borne and raised within 30 miles of Oakworth (my uncle was the village butcher at the time the movie was made), I really enjoy the local scenery. The old steam trains of the Worth Valley are the real stars for me."
2,"Too many anectodes, not technical enough","I was expecting a book getting very technical about the guard play, with numerous drills and practice examples. I've found a very short book, full of life anectodes from the 2 authors. It could really be improved with more pictures, diagrams, etc..."
2,"Pretty, but not very useful","This looks nice, has nice wiring harnesses, but is not very good at its intended function ie. speed control. The controls are too cheap, very narrow range of control, not much better than the hi-lo toggle switches."
4,"This book was suspenseful, it kept me on the edge of my seat",The Naked Face was so suspenseful I could not put this book down. I wanted to continue reading just so I could find out who the killer was. Everyone seemed to be a suspect.
3,Somewhat Predictable,"I enjoyed reading The Naked Face, but it was somewhat predictable. There is one surprising twist at the end, but overall it is not Sheldon's best. From the beginning it is obvious that he is setting up one character to be the downfall of Judd Stevens, and I was disappointed when I reached the end and it turned out I was right. But maybe I've just read too many murder mysteries..."
2,Sheldon Has Improved,"Ok, this was the Master's very first novel. I might have given him a higher mark if I had not read Bloodlines,Master of the Game,The Sands of Time and the Memory novels first. Though this novel is not as exquisite as his others, it does show how MUCH Sheldon has improved! Since I am such a die-hard Sheldon fan, it breaks my heart to say this but if you are new to Sheldon, I would not recommend The Naked Face as your first pick (or any pick for that matter). Please try some of the later novels that are mentioned--they are thirst quenchers!"
5,Love It,"This is a wonderful, long-lasting scent. Great for anyone who loves an oriental-musky scent. The Sandalwood is very noticeable. Love it!"
4,My child loves them,"As soon as I opened the box, he grabbed them, took his shoes off, and exchange his old shoes for the news.I personally like how they look and he does not fall as often as with his previous sport shoes. Creates more stability on his gait."
5,Great Series,I really enjoyed reading this as well as Witch and Warrior. Post-apocalyptic with many different characters to walk with. Look through the eyes of those who have survived in more ways than one.
4,Discover Alchemy,"PART I of this book deals with the history of alchemy. You will be given a quick history lesson on it's earliest beginnings and also a bit of history on all the most famous alchemists.PART II deals with the theoretical aspect of alchemy, and the nice part about it is that it is not written in gibberish but plain english so anyone can follow with what is being said.PART III is about the use of metals in medicine and other practical uses of alchemy. Plus you get to read extracts from 'The Golden Tractate' and 'The Revelation of Hermes'.I found this book quite helpful in trying to understand the meaning of alchemy and the way to go about it since it was written by a practicing alchemist in plain english."
2,I was expecting more...,"Well in simple words... I was looking for more... half of the book talks about Alchemists in the middle ages, nothing there... then the rest of the books is just copy and paste of other books... very disappointed."
4,Samsung SyncMaster 172s a Winner,A top quality product. Sharp text and bright colors with many resolution choices. Setup was as easy as plug and play gets. I've had mine for years with no complaints. I recommend this monitor to all that don't measure quality by the pound.
3,Cool pen bad clip,"The clip is constantly sliding off the pen no matter how far down you push it. I'm positive one day it will result in me losing the pen or the clip, but the pen itself writes great."
4,Neat pen,I like the size and feel of the pen but I don't like the clip. It keeps coming off. I think a drop of gorilla glue will solve that.
2,Boogie Stop Santoro,"This book was a major disappointment. I am a huge Charles Mingus fan and looked forward to this book with great anticipation. To give Santoro his due, he does do a great job situating Mingus in a broader context, not just of the jazz world but of the contemporary avant-garde arts scene. And one certainly does get a good feel for the personality and life of Mingus here. But the writing style is sophmoric, full of throw-away phrases and juvenile attempts to be hip. How many times does he conclude a paragraph with (I can't remember the exact words) something like, ""He felt the zeitgesist working again."" Santoro also shies away from discussing Mingus's music--rarely does he venture an opinion on a particular concert or recording. He also gives short shrift to Mingus's sidemen. I would recommend this as a pretty good read, but start with Brian Priestly's bio and be prepared for an extrememly annowing prose style."
5,Great Product,"I have a 9 year old Golden Retriever who was having trouble getting up and down. She was not her usual happy self. After two weeks on the Synovi G3 Soft Chews, she is moving much better and galloping around with the little silky Terrier. It is so good to see her feeling so good. I read the reviews on the product before I purchased it and wondered if it really was as good as they said. Now I know for myself that this product worked. Thanks to the previous reviewers for the honest opinions and helping me make the right decision."
4,Seems to work well,"Seems to be working as disscribed. Since taking it, my dog hasn't limped at all, though her hind leg is stil obviously weak with age and probably arthritis, though an xray didn't show it"
2,Didn't work on my dog's advanced arthritis,"This is recommended and sold by my holistic vet as the best thing out there for arthritis. I have ordered 5 or 6 tubs of it (I have two large dogs) and made sure to give it according to the directions and even a little more-so when I couldn't see a change. This didn't seem to help my 13 and 14 year old husky mixes at all, but they do have rather advanced arthritis. The chew however is convenient and my picky dogs would eat it without doctoring."
2,Needs better flavor,"While this product may indeed produce magnificent results as other reviewers state, I will never know because it is almost impossible to get my dog to eat them (even when coated with peanut butter or meat juice). My dog is NOT a picky eater usually, so I'm not sure why others are having so much success with this supplement when my dog won't even eat it when covered in food she normally loves. I gave it two stars for the nutritional value, but the flavor needs a huge improvement!"
1,It upset my dog's stomach!,"I purchased this after doing some research and reading all the rave reviews. My 11 year old dog had a back injury and couldn't stand on her back legs and was taking pain relievers for a few days. I decided to purchase this as a supplement since her injury could be a sign of arthitis due to her old age. Well when I received this, I was overwhelmed by the awful smell and I was worried my dog wouldn't eat it. She did but it was hard for her to chew it. She's a 34 lb lab mix. She also had loose stools after the first day. After about a week, she stopped eating and was lethargic. I stopped the soft chews and she's back to normal. Please use with caution if your dog is elderly or has a sensitive stomach."
5,great product and price,I order these supplements for our dog from Amazon.com because our veterinarian cannot even get this amount for this price. I pay less than half of what they would charge for the same product/amount.
4,GREAT product!,"The product itself works GREAT! I have 3 dogs on it over 12 years and they have all done GREAT!I just wish it had a better taste, my dog well only eat it make with something."
1,Safety First,"Unlike previous purchases of this product, it came with no expiration date on the container. In view of its past recall and after talking to the distributor, I concluded that it might not be safe for my dog and returned it."
3,Very entertaining,A well done production but not as funny as the video of the stage production done in San Francisco some years ago and broadcast on local PBS television.I'm looking for a copy of that broadcast.
2,the woman who loved elvis,"it was a boring movie. the best part was when the words ""The End"" showed up. glad i got the movie cheap! save your money and buy a better movie"
4,Entertaining and challenging...,"We got this for our oldest son (13) this Christmas. He loved it and spent hours making his own game. Our other sons (10, 8 and 6) became interested. It is a little too challenging for the younger ones, but they can play the games the older ones create. Great to see them working together!"
3,it's ok,i am a person who likes action movies ex. courage; fire proof; why did i get married; not like i thought it would be
4,Knowing the Real Man,"I've always enjoyed listening to Josh McDowell on the radio and I knew, he like most men of God, have had their hardships. I just never realized where he'd really come from.Undaunted is a movie about the testimony of Josh McDowell. Here you get to see what drove Josh McDowell to hate God and then years later what brought him back into the arms of His Savior.A great story for Sunday School classes or small groups who might be interested in studying great men of God. This very ""raw-from-the-heart"" story will bring tears to your eyes as you see the redemptive power of Christ work.Nice DVD.Cindy SprolesChristian Devotions Ministries[...] Editor"
2,Not exactly,"The item I received was not exactly at pictured. I ordered the Khaki Green color, which looks sort of brown with horizontal wash pattern in the picture but the one I received was just plain Olive. Solid color no pattern to it. The size Small I ordered was more like a Medium and the arm holes are much wider. I blame myself a little for trying to buy clothing online, its usually not as pictured."
2,All ad,I did learn a 1 or 2 things from this video. I know that had I saw a review for this I would not of bought it. It is more of an addvertisment then a video that you could learn something from.
2,Poorly made product,"When we received this product, the hose connecting the air pump to the launch tube was collapsed. Also the launch pad is made of foam, so when you put the rockets on the launch tube, the legs collapse. Every single time we launched the rockets, they would only launch about 60 feet, which is quite a difference from the ""up to 300 foot"" advertisement."
4,"Kids love it, but the wings easily fall off","This is a great product and will be the hit of the neighborhood. The only reason that it gets 4 stars is because the ""wings"" on each of the rockets (3 each) are poorly attached. Most fall off by themselves with regular use and if they don't fall off on their own the kids can easily pull them off. This isn't a big deal because it doesn't prevent them from flying. Otherwise, this is a great product!"
5,Great wonderful Hawaiian Eye,"This is the show that launched Connie Stevens career, I couldn't wait to see her each week with her long braid going through a straw hat. I want to own each episode, that I haven't seen since the late 60's when it was in syndication for a short time in the Philadelphia area."
4,Early Robert Conrad,"Hawaiian Eye was one of the set of sexy Warner Brothers PI shows of the late 50s and early 60s. Along with the legendary 77 Sunset Strip, Bourbon Street Beat, and Surfside 6.Hawaiian Eye notably featured TVs first substantial look at Robert Conrad, who of course became a TV series staple with shows such as Wild, Wild West, and Blacksheep Squadron (aka Baa Baa Black Sheep).A young and beautiful Connie Stevens is also in evidence, with an entertaining song number almost every show, and an occasional involvement in a case.Anthony Eisley was suave and confident as the senior partner. Unfortunately this would be Eisley's best role, as after this show he basically was limited to guest star slots on other series.The stories are often somewhat simplistic, often involving solving a dangerous problem more than solving a deep mystery. However, all the actors are engaging and interesting, and anyone with a yen for TV nostalgia will enjoy them."
4,"If you are a Robey fan, you'll love this movie!","This is one of the few movies in which Louise Robey (from Friday the 13th the series)has starred. Her scenes alone make the movie worthwhile. The plot could have been better, but I enjoyed the DVD!"
2,Cheep look and feel,"Most i care about are the handles, the look cheep and feel cheep too. I have to buy valve stems since the one was shipped with it was too long. I would not recommend this set which totally looks different in home depot."
1,Blatant rip-off,"Although the cover of this edition states that the films have been digitally remastered from archival material, this is nothing less than a blatant lie. ""Beat the Devil"" is mastered from the usual poor quality positive print, and picture quality on ""That Uncertain Feeling"" is simply awful - about the same you get on an EP mode VHS tape. I have never yet seen a DVD manufacturer sink so low. Do not believe the reviewer who raves about this edition, do not buy this, and do not buy anything released under the same label."
2,"Not as bad as some other movies, but bad enough","The movie starts out somewhat okay (at least suggesting it might deserve a 3-star). However, it goes down hill and does so at an agonizingly slow and unremarkable pace. As has been pointed out in other reviews, everything about the movie is cheezy. Unlike films such as The Core and The Day After Tomorrow, science gets short-sheeted here, including the repeated catch phrase about science never being wrong. Looks just like a made-for-TV effort."
3,Eh,"Hey, it won't win Oscars, but I'm a sucker for b-list natural disaster sci-fi movies. I thought it was pretty entertaining."
2,ABSOLUTE NONSENSE,"This straight to video release suffers from a low budget, a lack of imagination and an incredulous plot. Seems like the earth's poles are shifting and soon Miami and the southern US are going to be the new Antarctica. Of course we have the brilliant scientist who knows it's going to happen but no one believes him; the lovely ex-flame of the scientist; the corporate exec whose greed won't allow him to admit he knows the scientist is right; and the cute college couple who romantically banter back and forth.Jeff Fahey does his best Rod Steiger impersonation in an over the top performance and Erika Eleniak looks like she wishes she were back in Baywatch.For fans of disaster films, it's mildly entertaining but too preposterous to make an impact."
3,"""Ho Hum""...","Typical low-budget ""disaster"" film. Mostly pathetic acting but still (and I really don't know why) a good way to kill 90 minutes. One ""blooper"" (can you really have a ""spoiler"" for this type of film?)was when the news anchor lady said ""icebergs are forming"" in the ocean off the Miami beach. Icebergs don't ""form"" from salt water! Oh well, ""science is never wrong"" (a quote). Enjoy!"
3,Pure 90's R&B,"Around Tupac's last days, I stopped checking for any Death Row Artists. Especially after Dr. Dre left, the Death Row sound started to dissapear and other artist's on the roster were pushed back in favor of Tupac. I believe this was why Hung Jury was slept on. Although this is pure R&B, I feel the album could have been better. If you take a look at Michelle's appearance on the Dogg Pound's first single ""Let's Play House"", Michelle sung on that song so good that she could have carried the whole song by her self with Nate Dogg. If she was given that kind of material, then she would have had the same success, if not more, than when she first came on the scene with ""Nicety"" and ""Somthing in my Heart"". Her voice is still there, all that is missing is Dre's beats. When he left, most of the artists on Death Row were stumbling on production and direction."
4,solid soul record,"This album is a solid soul record with a fine voice but no oustanding hits. Her debut with Dr Dre and the hit No More Lies was stronger. But if you are into soulmusic, it's a good buy"
1,rip off copy?????,I love this movie. It makes my teeth hurt to think it is a rip off. But from the looks of it I can almost guarantee it is a fake. The last I heard Ted Turner was in the process of gathering votes to reissue it. Thinking this was the reissue I bought it. This is not a Ted Turner release. Or any other studio release. Don't buy this as the quality is no good.
5,Better than Clapton,"It's a real stretch for me to say that anyone is better than Eric Clapton. But the truth is - Mark Knopfler is the best guitarist I have ever heard - Sailing to Philadelphia is my all time favorite album/cd.I am an Ozark Moutain Daredevils fan too and I have worn out 5 of the ""quilt"" albums and cd's and I think one 8 track tape. Sailing to Philadephia will beat that record for me.~Chrissy Phillips, Springfield - MO"
5,Best of all,This is the best Mark Knopfler album he has recorded. The title track with James Taylor makes it worth buying for that alone.
4,Mark creates a great CD,"Sailing to Philadelhia is a CD that you never get sick of, great bunch of songs I enjoy each time I play it.Get it!"
4,"""Sailing"" is the appropriate term.","Of course when I first played this album I was mesmerized by the song, ""What it is"", I still am. The song is a throw back to his old band, Dire Straits, which is the reason I have always loved Mark Knopfler's music. The title song ""Sailing to Philadelpia"" is a true masterpiece, The haunting guitar and superb vocal harmonies are genius. The only complaint I have is that the rest of the album doesn't measure up to those two songs in imagination and imagery. ""Who's your baby now"" and ""Do America"" are the weak links in the chain of this otherwise stellar collection. It always takes some listening to a new album to appreciate it fully. So to the nay sayers; Listen more, listen often and I believe you will change your tune. I think that any true fan of Mark will love the effort."
2,Straits Fans Will Be Disappointed,"Don't be fooled by the first track, the bulk of this release is far from the energetic sounds Knopfler belted out with Dire Straits. While technically impressive, most of the songs on this release are plodding and moody, and the few up-tempo cuts seem gratuitous and lacking in any real creativity. Cameos by James Taylor and Van Morrison bring some temporary light to the darkness, but sound a bit out of place overall. Afterwards, Knopfler returns to an overly somber set, which wouldn't be bad except that he tries too hard to be poetic, while the music takes a back seat. The resulting sounds are just background to the obscure lyrics. Zzzzzzzzzzz."
3,Average at best,Love this guy's guitar playing. He's a master of cool licks and impeccable sounds. But he's never been much of a songwriter except for the occasional diamond in the rough. That's not a bad thing or a sarcastic knock. If every song was a gem he'd be up there with the Beatles (and who is?). I consider his first solo cd superior to this one mainly because there are 3 or 4 really great songs on it whereas this one just doesn't have one in that category. Still nice to listen to when you are in the mood for pleasantries on a platter.
5,"Welcome Back, Mr.Knopfler","I've been waiting for this album for a long time. Mark always been one of the most tallented guitarists of all time and he proves that time is relative indeed. With the same freshness of the Dire Straits era, Sailing To Philadelfia brings Knopfler at his best shape, with mature rock tunes, special appearences by guests like Van Morrison with the only purpose to make good music. Buy it and feel the same."
5,Etherial guitarist!,"Of course, the first two cuts are great, and most of the songs are derivative, but in today's crowded music scene, what tunes aren't in some way or another? But this man is gifted, no doubt. He may not possess the technical wizardry of Clapton, but his guitar work remains the most haunting and soul-searching of any I have ever heard. 100 years from now, music students will be listening to ""Speedway At Nazareth"" just to hear, over and over again, the closing 3 minute soaring guitar masterwork. Go---and listen to it---with headphones. You will not hear any better closing segment in any song by any artist. Period."
2,Half of a good book,"I'd give this 2 1/2 stars if I could; this is -half- of a good book. Plot and background - fine. (Several reviewers have mentioned they felt there was too much 'gemology' in this novel, but frankly, it's the only interesting thing here.) Character development and characterization - completely absent.If the author had spent HALF the time developing her characters as she did presenting the stone details, this would have been a good book. It reads as if she was following one-two word descriptions of each character - Kate, beautiful and talented; Sam, rebellious and honorable, etc.A good editor (or even a half-way literate and disinterested reader) could have told her this.Wait for the paperback or get this from the library if you must read it. Not particularly recommended."
2,Not as Good as Most,I have ready many of Elizabeth Lowell's book and must say this was definately not the best. The plot was not well developed and was not interesting enough. As far as romance there really wasn't any page turners and really was a let down. One of the things I enjoy most about her books is the suspense and the romance. This book was definately lacking. I also agree the hair clip things made no sense.
1,Just stop already....,"I can honestly say Ms. Lowell hasn't written a great book since she pretty much ended the Donovan series. Pearl Cove was the last ""great"" story, but I liked Midnight on Ruby Bayou. Since then, the rehashes and the new stories just are not cutting it. As other reviewers have stated, I will not buy anymore of her books in hardcover."
2,Highly Biased Hagiography,"This book purports to be a biography of the prophet, however being written by a follower of his Bahai faction, it is anything but impartial. It's just about worth reading, if you're interested... but you have to look between the lines, where there are some obviously unsavoury things lurking... what was the real story between Baha'u'llah and his brother and the rival Bahai sects? I doubt it was as told here... hagiographies are usually this way... also Bahais have been attacked by the Iranian authorities, but did they in fact provoke some of this and threaten a coup? The Bahais are a much more peaceful and internationalist religion now, but a read of this hints of their bloody origins. Have a look, but take a pinch of salt."
4,Beginning Algebra,"This book is in great condition For being used, no writting on any pages or the covers, no bent pages, over all in perfect condition, and I am picky on how a book looks. I hardly even used the book because I ordered it and it was the worng book but I looked through it and used it to study until I got the right book."
1,worst idea ever,"what a waste of money!!! i realized i would need mymathlab in addition to this book which is fine because i'm taking an online class, but none of the homework or solutions are in this text. now if i want to do my homework at work or on the go i have to print it out at home first or hope i have an internet connection wherever i go to do homework. i feel like i totally got ripped off."
3,Had promise but...,"...turned into a biography of Al Gore instead of a movie dedicated to discussing global warming and environmental issues. For those wondering what the movie is REALLY about, you should be prepared for about 60% of the movie covering the global warming issue framed by the other 40% that runs like a overview of how Gore became who he is today (son hit by car, sister dies, loses vote to Bush). Are his experiences important in making him who he is now? Sure. But does it detract from the overall power of the information? Yes. Crafty packaging and media buzz has seen fit to gloss over those aspects of the film and those who are expecting a feature length documentary on global warming (like I was) will have to deal with 45 minutes of close up shots of Gore pecking away at his Apple PowerBook and talking about growing up on a farm. This movie gets three stars only because the INFORMATION is so important."
2,"Good message, boring movie","I liked the information presented in this movie and I would like to see more discussion about it. This might have been a very good lecture to go to, but as a movie the film comes up short. It's just not very good and seems to really drag towards the middle. This film could have really benefitted from being produced like an actual documentary. I would have liked to hear from some of these scientists and scientific experts that Gore talks about and maybe some live footage instead of photo stills. And the Al Gore bio side-story side-tracks the entire movie. People didn't want to hear him blah, blah, blahing about himself and his family when he ran for president and the same people won't want to hear it now. Great information but its just poorly packaged(At least as a movie). It should either be a documentary or a tapped lecture but it just doesn't work as both."
1,zone1... so doesn't work in France!,I would have liked Amazon to warn me about the fact that i would be unable to watch it in France... Being specific about the zone would be nice. I hate those zones anyway.
2,Propaganda,"Though it uses fear tactics and half-truths, this 90 minute power-point presentation serves as persuasive propaganda."
5,"Politics aside, surprisingly well presented","This presentation makes a strong fact based backing of what can or is already the consequences of global warming.I have been to a few of the locations pointed out in the video, including Glacier National park. And if I had just watched this video I may have been skeptical of a one sided argument that was packed or spun for ulterior motives. But seeing the results here and now this becomes really spooky. The thing that makes Stephen King stories so scary is that he keeps them just n the realm of reality; so if there is any credence to the global warming we are now in the middle of a Stephen King scenario.The film is not just a scary we are doomed message but offers reasonable sounding practical alternatives.The first step in any action is awareness.What do you think?What will you do?Who Killed the Electric Car?"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"What a crock! Helloooo...if this politician believes so strongly in this subject, why did he not do something about it when he was in a better position to do so? I've got an idea...let's get rid of all the hot air in government first! That would surely make a dent in global warming. But seriously, don't waste your precious time or hard-earned money on this BORING piece of garbage. Spend the time doing something memorable w/ your children instead."
4,Very interesting and intriguing,"Even though I liked this documentary, and it did leave me thinking about how can we all as single human beings help the earth last longer with a little effort and consciousness, I must say that because of all the hype I heard prior to wathcing it, my expectations were higher for this film. But I do reccomend it :)"
5,Inconvenient Truth - Required Embracing,"This documentary is required for all earth citizens. This is not just about the USA. However, the US citizens need to pay special attention to the content of this documentary and then become willing to take even a small action. The documentary is well done and clear in its message. Buy it and show it to your friends. We need a higher level of consciousness regarding our actions and their consequences."
1,Junk Science,Don't waste your money on Al Gore's junk science designed to expand socialism in this country.
1,Too many lies from a hypocrite.,"It's hard for me to believe Al Gore actually believes this stuff and isn't just using this movie to earn a buck. If so, he needs to live by example.His home uses 12-20 times more energy than the average household (while only 4x the size) - Search snopes.com or truthorfiction.com for ""al gore energy"" to find out for yourself. He also uses his private jet (search youtube for al gore jet) which is the most inefficient means of travel. Don't believe the movie when he tries to portray himself using a commercial airline. He only did that for the movie.I'm sick of lies and hypocritical politicians.Don't be fooled"
1,selling fear/not fact,read state of fear instead. it has more correct facts than this and is at least labled fiction.
1,Was Michael Moore involved in this??,"It is a far stretch to call this a ""documentary"". A comedy would be more appropriate. I think there was more scientific fact in ""the day after tomorrow"""
1,Regions,"1 star is not a real reflection of how I rate this item. My review would not be eligible for submission if my real rating of - was submitted. -hopefully states the obvious i.e. I have abstained from rating this item at all.Why?Because I don't believe in the content?Because it was filmed in a controversial manner?No.I abstain because despite my best intentions the ordered DVD region is not compatible with my DVD player.Yes, I'd hoped that my mailing address, specifying my country, would also suggest the region I needed the DVD to be compatible with.Alas, when I attempted to play the DVD on opening ""an inconvenient truth"", in the form of the DVD player region and the DVD region incongruence, was revealed.Not sure what we can do about this as there isn't a place to specify your region with an Amazon order (no understanding that you mailing address is not enough).Nonetheless do keep it in mind."
4,Definitely an eye-opener,"I've been meaning to watch this and I finally did this past weekend. Gore does an amazing job in his presentation conveying his message about what is happening and what we must do to stop this. He presents this more like a ""friend to friend"" format than in a politician's crafted jargon. It is definitely a must watch.The reason I am giving this 4 stars, however, is that as Gore mentions how we must reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the movie shows him at one point riding in a motorcade on his way to deliver his presentation and at another point him driving a Cadillac on his Tenessee farm. Obviously these aren't two ways to do what he emphasizes, even though the motorcade was for security reasons. While I have read elsewhere that Gore does primarily drive a hybrid vehicle, I was somewhat bothered that the movie shows him doing otherwise. But this is by no means a bash on Al Gore...it's more a bash on the movie direction."
5,An Inconvenient Truth,"I liked very much An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore is an amazing Professor...it was no boring, it was a very interesting documentary. I learned a lot about our planet system, thanks....."
3,A bunch of exagerations,"Al Gore is trying to convince us that the rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is causing warmer temperatures. That is his premise. So he shows graphs that illustrate how over the years as the level of CO2 rises so does global temperature. Well guess what? What if you want to interpret the graph the other way around? Suppose the natural increases in temperature are causing CO2 levels to rise. Maybe because of a natural, cyclical rise in temp more forests are burning and less trees are processing CO2 into oxygen. Well, the point is that you can interpret bits and pieces of scientific data to meet your needs. The reason I gave this a 3 star rating is because I was entertained and amused by AG. He is a funny clown."
1,Ask yourself one question,"Why, if this is such a dire time for global warming, would you have to pay to learn about it? Al Gore advocates a global tax for global warming, and you think that's going to help?One more thing to think about: When a volcano explodes, it releases more CO2 than all of our cars combined in a year. Do research, don't be blind."
3,Pure Entertainment,"Hmmmm, I almost fell for this back in 1975. You know...when it was called global COOLING!The earth heats up and cools down folks. That's what it does. That's its thing. That's its bag, man. Peace.I gave it three stars because I do find Al Gore entertaining. The fact that most (if not all) climatologists (the ones with PhD after their names) have discounted the single computer model (created by Michael Mann...not the director) on which Gore bases his entire argument, make the film that much more entertaining.In twenty years, 'Rock and Roll McDonald's' will have sections devoted to the Y2K Virus and Global Warming. You wait and see.Your grand kids will look at Al's picture and say, ""Did people really believe this guy?""Ok, I was trying to be diplomatic...cold hard fact is, all of them disagree with Al."
3,mostly true but an attempt by Gore to put his name as the saver of mother earth since he lost the creation of the net...,"Movie is combination of Gore trying to sound like he is the only one trying to save our earth and that Bush and oil companies are evil...Good overview of the problems we're seeing and the evidence is real so we all do need to do our part.Gore points out population is huge part of the equation but fails to provide an answer as it is not convenient to talk about population control for either party...The republican right is in the wrong but so are the left's who still drive suvs, go to starbucks and buy 50"" plasma's... If we want cheap items, we're only promoting this global issue.Aside from self promoting pieces, movie is a great rental.A buy for most environmentalists (but why buy and have it shipped as that uses fuel...)"
1,Hardcore Propaganda,"This film is widely acknowledged to be chock full of major errors. Some of the ""scientist's"" claims and ""data"" have proven to be completely false and made up. The film was made with the intention of causing a global wealth transfer from capitalists to those that do not work. It made Gore a rich man, so mission accomplished on that front."
5,Easy to understand eye opening facts,"To put it simply, Global warming is real and anyone who says or thinks differently MUST see this film. Al Gore is extremely engaging in this documentary about how humans are adversely effecting the planet. This is a must see movie, even if you hate Al Gore and his political views."
5,Amazing,"Wow um, there are a lot of stupid, ignorant reviewers. An Inconvenient Truth is NOT a political tool, seeing as Al Gore is no longer in politics and has stated many times that he doesn't plan on going back to politics. And he DID try to combat global warming during his political career, but the idiots in congress were determined to ignore him because they couldn't accept the fact that we are facing an international crisis; they would rather be in denial and reassure themselves that what they knew was true were just rumors spread by hysterical scientists. Science and politics just don't mix, especially when billions of dollars of oil business is still yet to be by the petroleum corporations that control our government. This film has everything. It informs the general public about a topic that has for the most part been ignored, it is dramatic and well done, and even has humor and satire. Go see this. Do it. Do it."
3,"Entertaining, but only entertaining.","In the interests of disclosure, I note here that I am on the opposite side of Mr. Gore on almost every issue. With that aside, this movie is a good one. Gore is entertaining, even endearing in some points, and passionate throughout.The substance is a different matter: Many of Mr. Gore's conclusions and implied conclusions are factually incorrect, and some of the data he shows actually subvert his belief that rising temperatures are the product of rising CO2 levels, anthropogenic or not. His sophisticated presentation is actually extremely thin on hard, scientific facts.I spent $20 on this movie, in the interests of listening to the other side, being entertained, and maybe having my mind changed. Only the first two happened."
2,A Very Well-Written Piece of Fiction,"A very well-made and convincing documentary. However, do your homework and you'll find that the global warming scare is ridiculous. Those behind the scare are politicians, celebrities, et cetera. Consult real scientists and researchers, and you'll find that A) Global warming is not man-made, B) Trying to stop climate change is an absurd proposition, and C) Global warming would actually have positive effects."
1,WALMARTSCIENCE,"This political propaganda concerning the ""Man-Caused"" theory of global warming will in time be defunct to the real fact that ""The-Sun""is the reason of globalwarming and is way out of our hands. When there is something that should be addressed to the public with very plausible scientific proof such as 911 ""Inside-Job"" evidence of the US military industrial complex tamperings and deceit presented in well researched documentry dvds like ""LooseChange"" ""In Plane Site"" ""9!! Ripple Effect"" or ""911 Mysteries"", you`ll never find them in WALMART but not surprisingly you`ll find over-commercalized over-hyped Dime-A-Dozen dvds such as this politically supported documentry or ""docuMARTty"". Al Gore is a spokesmanfor the oil companies an elitous,a politician,a world federalist(new world order advocate) and a capitalist for his own legacy...........an easy ride for him in a pretty package concept."
3,Empires Collection - The Dynasties,"If you are an educated historical buff I think you will prefer a different collection. For instance, The Roman Empire's movie surrounds one 'king' and barely mentions other contributing leaders. Another description might state that this book is an enticement for an indepth study. The acting is minimal. A newbie could enjoy this series."
2,Band broke in 2 weeks,"love the watch but i have had to modify the band to stop breaking on me. needs more links that are removable and interchangeable, but i modified it to do that for me, so it is more easily repaired in the future."
2,Broke the first time it was worn!,"Very disappointed with this watch. We could not find it in stores, but found it on amazon. It was purchased as a birthday gift. The first time it was worn the watchband broke. We returned it and asked for a replacement, but have not received it in the mail. Overall, we are very disappointed with this product."
4,Almost Perfect,"I really like this watch, It's good looking, it's stylish and I love all of the features and they are really easy to use. I've only had one problem. One of the pins keep coming out of the band. I've been lucky to find the pin each time so far."
4,Timex T5H971 review,"I am quite satisfied with quality of workmanship. Illumination of the displayed time is excellent. Watch can be easily set-up, operated and can be comfortably worn because of its low weight (its body is made of plastic). May be, better material of the glass should be used.."
1,cheap,"I have owned timex sport watches in the past and have been happy with them but this watch is poorly made. the clasp will not stay closed, as u bend your wrist it will push the buttons on the sides and change the settings. I will from now on stick with the casio watches."
1,Poor Band Design,I've been through three of these watches. The band is poorly design and they have an unusually small pin connection to the watch. The cheap plastic on the watch breaks at the connection. I love this watch but seem to have designed it to fall apart so you have to keep buying new ones. It's junk.
