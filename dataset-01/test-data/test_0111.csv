4,Tragic,"Please not I read the revised version of this story, not the version that was first published. A tragic love tryangle were everyone ends up alone, or dead, not neccisarily in that order. Some preachyness to it, but not nearly as much as other works of hers I have read. I found I actually liked this better than little women, despite Silvia being the only character that got any development."
3,Interesting read,"I really enjoyed reading this, being one of the author's first novels. I laughed quite a bit, although the novel is not intended to be funny, because the characters and the plot are so hilariously overdramatic and unrealistic. It really reads like a first novel of a very passionate, young, idealistic, and romantic girl. She obviously had, at this point in her life, some odd and naive ideas about the meaning of love and the way people actually do live and love.Read this if you love LMA, not if you are looking for excellent plot and character."
2,very wordy,"This book is very wordy...I felt that the author used sentence structures which compicated the reader...I may be a simplistic reader, but I feel fluidity of sentence plays an essential role in conveying an idea to the audience."
5,Splendid!,"This particular twofer of Little Anthony and the Imperials with arrangements by Teddy Randazzo and Don Costa are the 2nd and 3rd albums for The DCP label. They contain the two biggest hits of the lot, ""Goin' Out Of My Head"" and ""Hurt So Bad"". Practically all of the other songs within this compilation are sound compositions with an orchestra that moves like a movie soundtrack. This music is timeless. There was a 5th and final album by Randazzo, Costa, and the Imperials called ""Movie Grabbers"" which consisted of movie songs and themes and is a gem of a record. Hopefully someday it might get re issued. Breathtaking music."
5,It's been 5 Years since I read this book and STILL remember how great it is!,This is her scariest book. I love it! I read it in one sitting. In my opinion this is probably her best book published. It's a memorable one.
5,A Cry In The Night,"Mary Higgins Clark is a wonderful writer love her books, always keeps you on the edge of your seat, can't put the book down and can't wait to pick it up again!A Cry In The Night"
5,Mary Higgins Clark-A Cry in the Night,"this is a wonderful book for women.it tell the story of a woman working in a gallery when she meets a handsom painter who sweeps her off her feet.They end up getting married after a few days,but the fun doesn't last for long.Soon he starts to disaper for days at a time to his cabin where he paints.she starts to have terriable nightmares and learns the truth about her husbands past."
4,This One Made Me Sleep With One Eye Open,"I am truly a fan of Mary Higgins Clark. I have read all of her books at least once and I read this one a couple of years ago and it is STILL fresh on my mind. I won't reveal the plot in this review but I'm confident that if you like mysteries, you will read it in one sitting; I did. After reading the other reviews of Mary Higgins Clark's works, I will agree that most of her stories are somewhat similar, some (though few) maybe even predictable, but she keeps it clean and smooth, never too may words or too much useless info. They usually have a happy ending in which the good ""guys"" or ""ladies"" win and I feel satisfied when I'm done reading it. Honestly, in this day and time, couldn't we all use a happy ending? All in all, this is my favorite, but don't take my word for it - read it yourself."
5,...it's been top 3 in my rotation for the last 6 weeks!,"That pretty much sums it up. The first 2 songs start the disc off perfectly. If you like Ani, Tori, Cure, you will love this band."
3,good songs muffled by sketchy production value,"I saw this band at the Middle East (club in Cambridge, MA) and was absolutely blown away! By far one of the best shows I've ever seen at a local club. Nothing out there is as original and entertaining as them. Which is why I was a bit disappointed with their album. The mixing is poor, especially where I have to turn up the volume on parts of the song and then quickly turn it down during a chorus. The piano sound quality (not the playing) didn't sound that good either. In the hands of a good producer, there will be no stopping them!"
5,One of America's Top 5 Guitarists,"I purchased this album many years ago on vinyl. It has always been one of my favorites. Leo Kottke is a guitarist, par excellance. Except for a brief outing in the ""New Age"" genre Kottke is best known for his work in Folk music. What I like about this album is how he does some rock tunes, most notably The Byrds, Eight Miles High, and Procol Harum's Power Failure in that special Kottke style. And what is great about it is that the songs don't come off as hokey folksy, C&W, renditions of rock songs. The songs hold their original flavor while being enhanced by Leo Kottke's great guitar playing ability. But, there is great folk tunes on this CD, like Cripple Creek, and Kottke's classic Pamela Brown. There is acoustic music, electric music, and live music. Add to this Kottke's unique singing style and this CD is a treasure. There is just not a bad tune on this CD. If you can only own one Leo Kottke album, this should be it."
3,Mixed review,It tends to move and thus not fully accomplishing its purpose. Other than that it is better then my old one.
3,"WORKS, BUT....not really for women","After having the unfortunate incident of getting a rare hernia--rare for a woman, I had to get something for support until surgery.So, after reading the reviews, I figured it would hold the hernia in, even though I didn't have the equipment for the support straps.Well, after receiving this belt, I tried it on and decided those support straps would have to go, as it wasn't needed. Anyway, evenwithout the support straps and for the price, it didn't do any more than a wide velcro belt would. Actually, my velcro and cotton belt,which can also carry a hot/cold pack, worked just as well. Well, maybe for a guy, it would work wonders, but for a woman...save yourselfthe money and buy either a wide velcro belt or a short-style spandex brief."
3,"Comfortable, but ...","The straps that go around the legs were way too long. Perhaps just a mistake in manufacture, or perhaps a design error, I do not know. At minimum adjustment, still too long."
1,size is way off med is way to big.,"size chart on box says hip size 35""-40"" is med ordered med came today tried it on way to big could not tighten ran out of velcro said they could exchange for a small for 6.95 plus I pay return shipping on the med sized one I say its not my fault thay make A med thats A xtra large got ripped off!!!!"
4,in spite of everything,"""in spite of everything, i still believe people are good"" -anne frankWOW i don't normally watch black and white movies but i am interested in the holocaust and really wanted to see this...the movie really captures the innocence, beauty, and pureness of anne frank...everyone should see this movie"
4,A Parent's Perspective,"My family and I listened to this book on tape as we traveled last week. As adults, my husband and I found the story fascinating and touching. As parents, we were shocked. Why is there swearing in a book that's labeled ""for ages 9 and up""? Also, why is there a gruesome and graphic description of a murdered woman's remains and what happened to them? If that scene had appeared, as written, in a movie, it surely would have been rated PG-13 or R. We really did enjoy the book very much, we were just horrified that it is considered ""children's literature."" When I was a child, May Amelia would have been in the young adult dept at the library, not the children's. Just my two cents."
4,THIS WAS SO GREAT!!!!!,"I really loved this book. it is about a young girl, who is a complete tomboy with LOTS of brothers, trying to become a ""Proper Young Lady."" May was just trying to fit in. i truly hated her Grandmother Patience, however, but i suppose that was how it was intended to be. i am sure you will hate her too. it was a great book. the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because there were too many capital letters. i warn you, however, that it is a sad book. the ending is sad, but it seems right and fitting. anyone older than 10 would probably aprecciate and love this book."
5,A very good book.,"Twelve-year-old May Amelia is one of the few girls in a small Washington farming community in 1899 - amd the only girl in a family of seven brothers. So it's only natural she turns out to be a tomboy. But now that she's twelve, everyone wants to turn her into a ""proper young lady,"" and she rebels against their efforts. This was a very good book. It had moments that were sad, exciting, and more."
3,Just be yourself,"This book was very good. At times it got sad, and at times it made me want to read more. When I was reading the book, the chapters had a lot of pages and I was getting frustrated about it. When I first started this book, I was wondering, ""What is this book about"" but once I read more I began to see the picture. The picture was just to be yourself. Nobody has to tell you how you are supposed to act. Just be yourself. This book taught me a lot of different things like that you can be anything you want to be, it doesn't matter what other people think of you, and believe in yourself. I would recommend this book to anyone who is an independent girl."
5,Early nineties music for the late nineties,"Probobly one of the greatest pop-albums ever made; Have A Nice Day will make you wanna sing, sing and sing again. The songs are extraordinary, with influences from the seventies as in ""Staring At The Ground"" and flashbacks from the old Roxette-days in ""Anyone"". The song with the long title ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around What's Already Gone"" is defenately one of the best songs ever written by Per Gessle. Enjoy!"
3,Not too good,"When I was playing this CD I was thinking: I have the wrong CD? This aren't Roxette! The discoteque style in a pair of songs and the generally modern, less accurate, too commercial songs have losted the great feeling of the old Roxette. I love all the old albums, not this one. Moneys had changed everything, now the Roxette band. Only one track is good and respect the old Roxette style: ""Anyone""."
2,Not Much of a Catch,"While I found the historical context of the story to be very interesting, unfortunately I found the story as a whole to be soap operish. It felt as though the author put more effort in getting as much history in as possible rather than writing a believable plot. By the second half of the book, I found myself to be reading in order to finish rather than reading for enjoyment. The ending does give some satisfaction, but I don't see myself recommending this book. It just seems too contrived which takes away from the message the author clearly intended. In a word, dissappointing."
1,Whut?,"I won't pretend to be a big fan of country music. Not mainstream country anyway, but I used to be. And even then I thought Toby Keith was one of the dumbest songwriters I'd ever heard. Now he's just a completely self-parodying, confederate flag-loving redneck. I work at a restaurant that plays country music all day, and the only time it ever really bothers me is when this egotistical dirt for brains comes on. That and Gretchen Wilson. Toby Keith's music is no different than the rest of today's pop-country, but he drags it to an all new level of lyrical stupidity with songs about himself and how much he loves drinking and being illiterate. Meanwhile, I've heard Gary Allan maybe once in the last two weeks, and he happens to be a thoughtful, intelligent songwriter. So I guess Toby knows his audience, doesn't he?"
5,wonderful,"great songs, sexy voice and super lyrics....with great music. what more could anyone want......"
2,"If you are new to Toby, DON'T start with this album","I have been watching videos and listening to songs by Toby Keith for some time now, but never purchased an album. I like Country... Johnny Cash, Reba, Jim Croce, etc. but I'm an old metal head at heart. After watching the video for ""As Good As I Once Was"" I immediately ordered the CD.Frankly, ""As Good As I Once Was"" is the only decent song on the while album.If you are looking to buy your first Toby album, start with a different one."
4,A RED WHITE BLUE BLOODED GRADUATE OF HONKY TONK U!!!,"Toby Keith shines and shines brightly on this latest installment in his unique and storied career This album offers a more laid back side of Toby, which is definitely a side I could stand to see more often Don't get me wrong, I love the patriotic flag waving in your face side of Keith too (Brought to you Courtesy of... and How Do You Like Me Now?) But this c.d has its own style that works well There are a few filler songs here too just like every c.d that kinda makes you wonder why you would waste the time to put the song on the tracklist, such as Your Smile and She Left Me, as well as a couple others The standout tracks are Honkytonk U, You Ain't Leavin (Thank God Are Ya?), She Ain't Hooked on Me No More, and the catchy I Ain't as Good as I Once Was Definitely worth a listen, or two or three or a hundred Great piece of work Toby!!"
4,Arkady Renko is back in fine form,"In this follow up to the amazing Gorky Park, Arkady Renko is pulled out of the bowels of a factory ship on the Bering Sea to investigate the murder of a fellow crewmate. The story has elements of deception, lust, political turmoil, and Soviet culture. This was an enjoyable and interesting read about one of the most compelling characters I've ever encountered. While not as complicated as Gorky Park, Polar Star is satisfying and entertaining."
5,Smith captures Soviet Russia once again.,"Polar Star was better than Gorky Park, introducing a more diverse array of characters. I especially like the accurate portrayal of Americans and Russians. Finally, a Cold War book by an American that doesn't glorify Americans and villify Russians! Arkady Renko is a character that one can relate to. Great work Mr. Smith!"
1,the missing brain,"Too much Shel is NOT a good thing! I felt my IQ level drop as I read this book, I wasn’t amused by his style and I’m sorry I didn’t read up on him more before I purchased several of his books. BE SURE you do your research because how he expresses himself is simply a matter of opinion, you just might not like it!"
3,Not bad,"There are a lot of people that really hate this game because of this, that, and the other (I will let you read their reviews) but I have to tell you I really enjoyed it. It gave me hours of entertainment and it, though definitely grind heavy, is fun. It does have bad voice acting but if you play enough jrpgs you will find that this is a common theme."
3,Band of Thunder Soap Dish,"While the other products in this line were worthy of the price, this one was not. The ceramic was of poor quality and frankly looked cheap. It had good soap holder risers inside the dish but the overall exterior quality looked like something you'd get free at a carnival prize booth. This was the only product from this line that I found disappointing thus far."
5,hand towel,I purchased that towel because it also matched my shower curtain. I feel your bathroom shower curtain should also please the man in your life and not always be floral. Thanks great seller great delivery of item. A++++
2,Very poor,I am very unhappy with the quality of this product! Very thin terry cloth. I would not suggest this product to a anyone!
5,Awsome!!!,Bought this for my daugther-in-law. She just loves it... I haven't seen it myself so thats about all I can tell you.
4,Easy to assemble and looks fab,"Maximize space with this great looking and affordable corner bookshelf! It was easy to assemble, too, which is always a plus. Not the absolute best construction I've seen (some of the hardware was a bit ""off""), but it's sturdy enough to do the job and it looks terrific. Overall, I'm very happy with this item."
4,Yummy but a bit gooey...,"Oh do these taste good! They are sweeter than I thought they would be, it's a thick coating and very dessert-like. They are a bit too gooey (sticky?) and can catch on your teeth. It is a true pecan pie flavor, even a bit artificial tasting. Don't know if I'd order again. I'm enjoying them but am aware of the sweetness/stickiness each time. Like the walnuts much more!"
2,Clouds Fun Band Live,"I saw Clouds a number of times live and they were fun andenjoyable. Their records on the other hand were not that good.They definitely should have used a better producer. Interestingthe reviews here. We have someone named Kath who's not CRAZYabout the CD, but none the less rates it FIVE STARS! Then someoneelse named Sarah who thinks it's just pleasant, but also ratesit FIVE STARS! Five Stars is reserved for a masterpiece, NOT analbum that is JUST PLEASANT or that you're not CRAZY about. Forthose that are interested in how Clouds sounded live. Listen to""The Carpenter"" that's their signature tune."
4,Interesting Story and Perspective,"I think one reason I liked it was that Johnny Did Not Glamorize or Glorify anything. He writes about himself in a natural, almost maybe ""humble"" way, which anyone can appreciate in a writer's story.His childhood is revealed and detailed wonderfully, and what an Interesting Childhood he had ! His ""rat catching"" stories,childhood thoughts, preoccupations and feelings are refreshing to read and learn about.The photos are intriguing and very ""for real"". Don't expect professional, glossy ,Glam photos. He's displayed the ""REAL""Great book for people looking beyond The Sex Pistols, behind the stage persona and interested in john Lydon for himself.I love this book and writing style because it captures him authentically and genuinely.You needn't be a ""Sex Pistols"" fan to enjoy this unexpected biography.Highly recommended for any readers !"
3,no values on normal ranges,You'll be surprised that the normal ranges of cardiac measurements are not given at all in the entire book.
4,WARNING: MISSING A SONG!!!,"I bought this CD as well as all the other available Robin Trower two-fers as a cheap way to replace all my old Trower LPs. However I discovered that the song ""The Shout"" from Victims Of The Fury is missing, apparently sacrificed due to time constraints caused by the double offering. It is one of the best songs on the original album, and I believe it was one of the ""single"" releases. A glaring omission! If they really had to kill a tune, I would rather have seen ""One In A Million"" get the axe. Other than that, everything is great! I have always loved VOTF, and slowly but surely the tunes from Caravan have grown on me."
4,A Big Omission...,"Here is a great compilation of two excellent Trower releases. One big problem, though: Who made the decision to omit one of the best songs on ""Victims of the Fury""? Man, was I disappointed when I listened and didn't hear ""The Shout"". I would have given the release five stars, otherwise."
4,Classic Kirk Douglas Western,Classic 70s Western with Kirk Douglas. Good pacing and mix between action and drama and with sets and locales and a fair budget. Did not not much in extra and/or features on DVD.
3,Pretty good,I bought this book when I was going threw a rough time and I enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone
1,"Lies, calumnies and more","A massively researched book, packed full of details yet drawing all the wrong conclusions. If the Kriegsmarine was a bumbling bunch of cheats who vastly overclaimed their meagre successes, you would have thought that the war at sea will be over in 1941."
5,A great baby pleaser!,"This was a gift for my now 13 week old son. He is just starting to grasp objects and loves the raised bumps on the teether-handles. The Square toys holds a cat ball inside and is a huge hit as well. He loves watching the ball turn as I rotate the toy. There are different fabics on the sides of the toys to stimulate infants (satin, felt, ribbed, mirror, ect)I love that the objects are extra large, so they are easy to grab and play with. Furthermore, there is plenty of the clear plastic top for him to be able to see the objects inside. (Some toys only allow a small hole and if difficult for that young age to see inside.) I was thrilled that someone gave this to us for it is defintely a Keeper!"
4,Great support,"I'm on baby number five and boy, do I wish I had this for baby number four! I am able to do so much more with this supportive belt. The velcro does cut into my skin somewhat, but I just re-adjust it and it's fine. Terrific product - gives support for my lower back and my lower belly."
3,Someone Screwed this mix up.,"This is a revamped version of the original release from '83. It is slicker, but that's it. They cut short some of the guitar solos. The best example is Red Sky, which was called ""Red Sky at Night"" on the Chrysalis release. This was one of my favorite Schenker songs, but when I listened to it I could'nt believe how it was butchered. This BGO version just doesn't sound like the original at all. Skip this one and find the original."
4,great directing,"great directing, acting. Captures the changing moods of the times. The madness of the 30s and the mads of the war."
2,Waste of time,"Sorry folks, this book is not all it appears to be. I considered it a beginners book after looking through it. Nice effort on the writers part but ""WHERES THE BEEF?????"
5,The best history book on the various early colonists...,"I got this book, and after reading the first chapter, I was hooked and had to read it through. This is really a fascinating read on the early settlers. There are some gory parts in it and one can almost feel what they went through with the horrors of being on an unknown land and at the same time you get the history of what was happening in England...I highly recommend this book for those who love history."
4,Soulful performer,"John Fred displays much more soul than his hit ""Judy in Disguise"" would leave one to believe. His New Orleans heritage come through clearly along with a Memphis vibe ala the Boxtops. Not content with one style of music it's refreshing to hear an artist willing to push boundries. His soul-ful, horn-driven version of ""Back in the USSR"" is the best I've ever heard."
4,Great read but you end up wanting more...,The fact that he has got this obsession with lists is both funny and enlighting. He does achieve as he intends to give you some perspective. I loved it and recommend it.
4,the only and so the best book about JSR-82 Bluetooh API,"I have been waiting this book for months, and now I have it in my hands. It really tells you all you need to start developingexciting bluetooth applications for tomorrow mobile devices.The best part of the book is the review of the available resources existing today for work with the JSR-82 like ATINAV stack and Rococo impronto simulator."
1,"Uh, excuse me.","I'm sorry but this is not what I call music. Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, KISS, Judas Priest, Slayer, L7, Motley Crue, The Ramones, Motorhead, W.A.S.P., The Great Kat, Megadeth, Ted Nugent, Anthrax, and Doro Pesch is more of what I would call music.How dare the music corporates would label the entire world and tell everyone what they should call music. This CD is nothing but hip-hop crap and dumb dance beats. There isn't a single rock n roll song on this entire CD. And this is what we're supposed to call music? It's time for heavy metal to take back the airwaves and get rid of this piffle and fluff once and for all.If this is what YOU call music, I'm sorry that you are a mere puppet of the industry and wouldn't know a good song if it blew your ears out."
4,~*Now 17*~,"Well, I've always loved the Nows, so this one is no differnt. Its got some really great songs on it like 1985 and Sunshine. I totally recemend this CD. You might not like all of the songs, but there are a few hits and some misses. So go out and buy this ausome CD!!! Keep the Nows coming!Jessica"
2,Misleading Advertising,"I preordered this DVD and anxiously awaited its arrival. This is DVD is misleading in its description. The jacket claimed a Dolby Digital soundtrack but it is really DD mono. What a disappointment. Also, the jacket claimed a commentary by the director, but selection of that menu option (under special features) consistently jumped back to the main menu -- no commentary. Good movie but a very disappointing DVD."
1,Amazon streaming left me screaming,"Imagine watching one of the greatest movies of all time, but having to re-start it from the beginning every 15 minutes because your streaming service is so amazingly inadequate you'd be better off with tin-foil and an antenna. This is how I would describe watching ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" on Amazaon."
5,Great feel-good movie,"A formula movie about a couple of misfits trying to find their place in the world. Richard Gere plays a candidate at Naval Officers Training School in Seattle; Debra Winger is the local girl who falls in love with him. Does Gere have the inner strength and character to make it? is the major theme of the movie. Louis Gossett, Jr. is the drill sergeant who puts him to the test. There are few surprises here and no deep insights into character, but the storyline is well worked out and the picture well done and very entertaining. We know he's going to make it, but we cheer anyway at the end when he does. It's uplifting in an old-fashioned Horatio Alger way. Sometimes the movie crosses the border into melodrama (the scenes with David Keith and Lisa Blount and Keith's suicide, for example), but on the training grounds, the movie is first-rate. Definitely worth a watch."
1,"DVD looked new, but skipped entire middle of movie","Movie just skipped ahead and cut out 30 minutes...I can see sections of it going forward or back, but won't let me see it normally. Very weird."
1,An Officer and a Gentleman,Could not watch it because it was not in a region 1 format. I try to be careful when ordering as I have another one that was a region 2 format that has me checking more closely before ordering. Thought I had check more closely on the format. So money spent on this one was another learning experience.
2,My Aim is true,I usually like a child POV..but this time it didn't do it for me. Adult would have been alot more effective.
4,Charming and Magical,"I enjoyed this book immensely. I think the narrative structure device using the history of the universe in relation to the period of 365 days is incredibly effective. The characters are a little shaky on the descriptive end, however I'm not certain that this isn't intentional in order to magnify the ""magical realist"" aspect of the narrative. In general, I found the book haunting and resonant in many ways. I look forward to reading the next novel Ms. Offill."
2,"Brotha Lynch, what happened???","I hate to say this, but this album is disappointing. I really don't think I have set the bar too high for both of these rappers. Both artists are extremely good with their craft and I have always enjoyed Lynch's work from 24 Deep, the Classic Season of the Siccness, Loaded and even Lynch by Inch. If you like Lynch and MC Eiht, you're probably expecting some hardcore, Mobb music material. hardcore gangsta **** is out the window on this track. There are a couple of decent tracks but not enough to spend 15 plus dollars on. I still recommend for you to buy the album, for I support Lynch all the way. Unfortunately the album is not up to par compared to his previous work. Purchase the product if you are a huge Lynch fan and see for yourself. Maybe your reviews will be much lighter than mine. Enjoy the album folks - I have to ""eat"" now..."
3,Busby Berkley at his best,"Forget the plot, forget the age of it and just enjoy the dance numbers and gags. It is not the greatest musical of the era but good enough for another viewing."
2,Great concept - poor quality,"I was so excited to have a mug that wasn't made out of plastic (or metal - as these impart a metallic taste to me), I bought 4 of these mugs. So disapointed. If you use it to microwave your beverage, you'll burn your skin off your fingers. They also started cracking within a month of use."
5,I've had mine for two years,"I've had mine for two years, it's held up great. I microwave it even with the pad on it. I just wish the lid was replaceable (I can't seem to find more). My lid broke after two years of use."
3,1/2 of a good disc,"I don't know why they insist on packaging 2 albums on 1 disc but it drives me crazy. Anyway, Long Misty Days is a nice effort by Robin. The problem is that he is so tame in the studio that you really have to see him live to appreciate all he can do. Still, it's a fun album that makes for some good party music.In City Dreams is horrible. It was the beginning of the end for Robin being a popular artist. Ironically, that's what he was trying to do, be more ""mainstream"". But writing lame pop songs with annoying electronic gimmicks did nothing but alienate his fan base.Because of this I have to take a star away from the overall rating."
5,WOW! Thank you Mr. Peckham,"Do not hesitate to buy this book if you are serious about taking your business to the next level. I have not been able to put the book down, plus you will continually be able to refer back to the information. Thanks Jack"
2,"Bad quality control, nice idea",I've bought 4 (sets) of these for gifts and 3 had at least 2 bad candles in the set of 10. The last set a bought were all ok. I wrote to customer service and they sent me out new ones. It took about 2 weeks. Otherwise they work well and are brighter than others I've seen.
1,SANDPAPER,MINE ARE SOOOO SCRATCHIE. I'VE WASHED THEM TEN TIMES AND USED SOFTNER THEY FEEL AWFUL. THEY HAVE DEEP POCKETS AND ARE PRETTY BUT IF THEY AREN'T SOFT PRETTY DOESN'T MATTER.
4,JC as read by JC,"No frills or fancy workings, just plain old Johnny Cash reading the New King James version of the New Testament. It's straight-forward and understandable, delivered in a matter-of-fact tone that leaves interpretation open to your own mind. Johnny Cash does his best to read without flair and dramatics, allowing the words to speak for themselves.I enjoy unwinding after a long day by throwing on some headphones and relaxing to the soothing words of JC."
3,America's place in the world,"The suggestions put forward by Gen Zinni are interesting but:1) They sound like Nation Building 101 - this we do not do.2) If his remarks are aimed at the current Administration he may as well forget it. Bush and Co. have no interest in listening to other people's suggestions as they consider this to be ""unpatriotic"" - they, and only they, know best or so they think."
3,Curse You Windows Vista,"I am a longtime experienced user of computers for home and business starting with the Apple 2 GS. I have put up with the multiple crashes of Windows 95 and 98, and revelled in the stability of Windows 2000 (best), and Windows XP. Now Microsoft has brought forth Vista, and I can report that the almost daily crashes of this system are driving me crazy. I was attracted to the HP Touchsmart by its several unique features, but the constant crashes are ruining my experience. I do not use any sophisticated programs, drivers or gaming stuff. yet the system is just not reliable. I have called HP customer service (very easy to reach), but they tell me to await an update that will resolve the problem. In the meantime, I can only use this new machine as a simple backup b/c one never knows when the BSOD will appear."
4,Good Stuff,"I do like a good strong cup of coffee so on my senseo I typically would put 2 pods in and press the 2 cup button. With this coffee I only need 1 pod to make a nice cup of coffee, not to weak and not to strong. So in the end I end up saving money because I only use one pod versus 2."
2,"Not of the strong, black ilk","This coffee was a disappointment. It is extremely weak and even, when I use 2 pods together (as suggested in the manual) to create an ""expresso"" it still is very weak. Also, (I think though that this must be the home cafe machine), the coffee has the taste of water."
5,Ilove this book and the price was awesome!!!,"I love the book and it was a great bargain. It has some great information on color theory for the watercolor artist,student or professional!!"
5,Great book!!,"One of a very few great books in watercolor. She gives many great philosophical and technical advices on color, shape, composition, and painting in general."
5,Making Color Sing,"Having never really mastered the complexity of colour use, I find this book a revelation. Easy to follow, practical yet detailed, it opens one's eyes to the use of transparent watercolour. This book has been around for quite a time - wish I had picked it up earlier.Well worth the investment!"
4,Good fun!,"This is one of those challenging-but-not-too-challenging puzzles. It's hard enough that you'll probably feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment at figuring it out, although you may experience some frustration along the way (but I think any decently challenging puzzle should have at least a few of those moments).I'd say this puzzle is a good beginner/intermediate puzzle for someone who enjoys brain puzzles like the Rubik's cube. Most people aren't going to be able to pick up a Rubik's cube and solve it on their own within a few days. But most people will be able to solve this one on their own within a few hours or days."
1,Be aware of the Co$ connection,"Be aware that this book was labeled as 'trash' by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and that the Food and Drug Administration issued a paper claiming the author destorts his facts. The book supports and suggests a chain of clinics called 'HealthMed', which are run by Scientologists. Make up your own mind."
4,"Dated, but still a lot of fun","If you don't mind using a little stealth, this game is real fun. Great deal."
3,A Feel-good checklist,"The book does a good job of outlining some of the common problems we all have, but rarely express or do anything about. It is creative in the way it is made. Everyone needs to read this at least once in their life."
4,"Interesting, to say the least","As a high school student, I found this book much more difficult to comprehend than othet titles I've been assigned in the past. Dillard's lack of transitions and seeemingly meaningless statistics and facts aggravated and confused me at first. As I read, though, I realized that not only was Dillard traveling on her own philiosophical journey, she was subconsciously forcing me to go on one too. Dillard's unique writing style forces the reader to looks for ""links"" in the book and to develop his/her own philisophy for what they're reading. I'm not sure if I'm ready to read another one of Dillard's works; I'm still reeling from this one."
2,"A qualified ""uh....""","I wanted to love this book. I wanted to love it as much as I have loved and been fascinated by ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"" and ""Teaching a Stone to Talk,"" and especially ""Holy the Firm.""But, sadly, halfway through I was so completely lost, I put it down, and have yet to pick it up again. I don't mind waiting for the other shoe to drop--I appreciate a good set-up--but criminy, I've got a limit!""Impressionistic Theology"" is pretty much the tag one can hang on this. But I wouldn't have minded if the focus was clearer. I'll try again, I promise. But for now, I think I'll curl up with something a bit less esoteric.Sorry..."
2,same old questions - much worse answers,"If you're a person who asks the ""big"" questions of life (Why are we here? What's the meaning of life?) don't look here for answers. Ms. Dillard asks the same questions she's been asking publically since ""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,"" but with much less satisfying results. In ""Pilgrim"" she explored the territory - attempting to find her own answers - in ""For the Time Being"" she is content to mostly quote the ""answers"" others have found. And she does a poor job of assembling those answers. Mainly, she confuses the reader (at least she confused me) - you wonder where she's going with all the disjointed, disconnected ""facts"" she tosses out. And at the end - if you're like me - you still wonder she's going.I would suggest, instead of reading this book, just read ""Pilgrim"" again."
2,how can something this deep be so boring??,"This book, though short, was incredibly boring. The only thing keeping me from a rating of 1 is the fact that she writes good prose and I kept thinking about the book once I'd finished it. I like creative non-fiction, and I like discursive writing, and I like elusive connections - but come on, Annie. Plus, this book's reflections on mortality depressed me. It doesn't make me want to read her other stuff at all. Oh snooooooooozzzzeeee!"
3,BonaX floor product,"I do not think I received this BonaX product. I emailed and found out that it was the same product. It did a great job on my wood floors. It took a lot of my time to get something, but it was Chriostmas time, and things can get lost in this busy season. Thanks"
1,nothing special,I tried the bona floor cleaner and saw nothing special in results - looked the same as when I mopped with soap and water - I guess there is no silver bullet.
3,Disappointing purchase,I purchased this refill with the Bona mop. My hardwood floors don't look any cleaner with this expensive product than they did with the less expensive Zep cleaner. I will use it until it is gone and then go back to Zep. So much for my research on hardwood floor cleaners.
5,Bona X Hardwood floor cleaner,"This cleaner is the best! when you use it, it will make your wood floors look so shiny and clean."
3,So far so good,There are alot of neat things you can work on your car without having to take it to the shop. This manual answers your questions and has details on how to the job right. If you cannot perform the job at least you know how it can be done right and ask if your mechanic can do it as specified.What I don't like is that it sometimes has designated images or descriptions to only one model. Wish it was just all mirage. (ex. galant and not mirage).
1,Not good for a mechanic.,"I bought this book in order to fix my Mirage 1994. But the author of this book believes that you know how to make all the things and just tell you take appart, and installing is the reverse for the disasemble... really disapointing, not for help in any way... The common tasks that can be done by a do-it yourself ocassional mechanic never are explained well. I do not recommend this book to a serious person that want to adventure in the mechanics world..."
1,what a horrible book!,"Dam I should have bought a basic car book on how cars work or something like that, cause if you don't know a lot about cars this book is written in a different language. It's vague, confusing, and almost worthless. But if you want some kind of reference book you have no choice so buy it used."
5,Want to learn more,"From this book,I can have interest in Market psychology.And I get to learn more about this. Please let me know about the seminar held by Tony Plummer !"
2,Obviously A troubled Movie which lacks pace,"This looked promising at first. A great cast, interesting plot, and then after about 20 minutes it became predictable and boring. The fact that this movie could not make it past an hour and 20 minutes is a sign that the makers had trouble with this flick. I wouldn't bother -- to be honest about it. It gets a c- from me. There are better movies to pick from."
2,Age old tale of a heist gone awry,"Armored stars Mat Damon is Mike, the leader of a security team which comprises of Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, and Amaury Nolasco, and Ty (Columbus Short)who is also having problems on the family front as he has to take care of his brother facing problems at school. Mike dreams of a scheme to steal 42 million dollars from the security company. Ty is initially against it but when social services comes to door and threatens to take away his brother, he reluctantly agrees. The heist starts as planned but when a homeless man is accidentally killed, Ty has a change of heart and goes against the wishes of others. One could easily detect the movie and its ultimate end. The charaters are portrayed well but acting talent in Damon and Fishburne is wasted. I thought the movie was just okay and offered me nothing new/ two stars 6/18/10"
2,waste of time,this movie did not deliver. not worth seeing. here i was rooting for the guys to get the money but some fool had to mess it all up. waste of time.
1,It has potential but is not very well written,"This movie has problems that keep it from being good:- Stupid, lame characters who should've killed the main character when they had the chance to.- It's main character: Tyler Hackett, is very lame and boring. HE RUINED THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND MADE THE PLOT FALL APART.- It's plot falls apart a few moments after it emerges.- It has barely any action scenes or good ones to speak of.- It's too short in length.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This movie would've been more fun to watch if these issues weren't present within it. This movie presents a case where the main character can ruin the whole movie. This movie has a good concept for a plot, but it wasn't set up or executed well. THIS MOVIE BLOWS! 1.5/10"
5,Just Great,"For years a used a piece of board I had around that happened to be covered with formica. One day it disappeared. (??) After checking various reviews, I bought this one. Couldn't be better."
3,It's alright,"Yea, it's okay. I use my laptop on it just fine (about a 9 lb laptop) and all, but it would be better if:1) it had a pad under the middle section that rested on your legs.2) the surface wasn't smooth wood. I knew this when I bought it, I'm just saying, it would be better if... When I'm doing homework on it in my ez chair, the book/paper likes to slide all around unless you are sitting perfectly level.For the money, it's a good buy, but I would have paid a little more to have the features I mentioned."
1,uneasy listening,"Sorry I bought this CD. Blue Grass it is not! The vocals are very difficult to understand and the musical instruments sound like they were being played by a group that has no appreciation for the history of blue grass. Very simply they do tunderstand how to play it.If anyone would like my copy, for free, please contact me at charlie@beerleague.com."
5,DAMN THIS GIRL CAN SING,"Keyshia Cole is one talented woman on her way to stardom. Her voice is like a blend between Mary J Blige, Mariah Carey and The late Great Aaliyah. Like Mary and Mariah, she can hit the high notes greatly, and Like Aaliyah, she has a nice smooth voice. I can't wait for this woman's album"
5,Writing insights,I always try to improve my writing ability and I bought this book to aid me in that arena. A must have for your personal library.
4,Stopped The Barking,"Every dog will bark. It's in their nature. I bought this collar in June 2009. I put this collar on my dog only at night so as not to wake us or the neighbors. He's a Shepherd/Lab mix and has a loud thunderous bark. The collar has dramatically controlled his barking. In fact he doesn't bark when it's on him. Since he learned his lesson, the batteries last a few months. I'm on my third battery since 2009. At six bucks for a two pack, it's not bad at all.I'm really giving it 4.5 stars. I would have given this product 5 stars if the red collar was more secure. The one I have has a metal buckle and also a black plastic clasp. The photo doesn't show a buckle anymore. Maybe PetSafe made some modifications because there have been occasions when the collar came off. However, it would come off at the clasp.Bark control did what it was designed to do. Control the barking. Now we have peaceful, restful nights."
3,Worked great-- for 2 months.,"Did everything I wanted it to for about two months, working better than similar products. Then the battery quit. Replaced the battery, then it quit working altogether. Despite this, I'm ordering another one and hoping it will last longer this time. At least I still have spare batteries left over from the last collar.I think this is a great product that suffers from either poor quality control or design flaws."
2,Poor performance,"I purchased this items as I got a second dog and needed a bark collar for each dog. The first bark collar is about 5 years old and is also from Petsafe - it's a different model, the non-deluxe version.The first one works well, the second (PDBC-300) seems to work occasionally. I called petsafe to see if there was something I was doing wrong and it seems everything is set up fine. However, they told me that in order for the dog to get the static correction, it had to both feel the vibration from the dog's bark and also 'hear' the bark. This sounds like a good design as my older bark collar only works on the vibration and would occasionally activate when the dog was scratching. However, with the new collar, where it needs both the sound and the vibration, it seems like this prevents it from activating when it should.I will be returning this product and getting the non-deluxe version (I think it is the PBC-102)."
5,Best Bark collar available,"This is the second ones I've bought for both of my dogs (a doberman and a Yorkie). The first ones lasted about 4 years. My husband thought that was a bad deal, so we tried several other brands. None of them held a candle to this Petsafe model. So needless to say, they have their Petsafe bark collars back on. The only problem is that they know when the collar isn't on they get away with barking."
3,Doesn't stay in place,"I couldn't get this collar to stay where it needs to be. I adjusted it according to the directions (snug, but not constricting. should be able to fit one finger behind contact point.) and every time she shook her head, it would move to the side. I tried making it tighter and it would stay, but it was clearly too tight and I was not able to get a finger (even my tiny pinkie finger) behind a contact point. So I never actually used this. I did try it in test mode (I put it on my arm) to see how it felt, but there was no static shock. You yell ""test"" at it and the orange light blinks. Does anyone know if it's supposed to produce a shock in test mode?I gave it 3 stars because I assume it works, but I just couldn't get it stay in place. Her neck fur is kind of like a Golden Retriever, but less fluffy and a bit shorter. She can't be the only dog with fur like that so I'm surprised more people don't seem to have this issue.Dog info: mixed breed, 30 lbs, neck about 12"" circumference."
3,works but item needs work,"i own a great pyrenees and it is hard to find a bark collar that really works! on high the dog showed response to the collar. my main issues with the collar is in order for it to stay in place you have to basically chock the dog. it kept slipping to the side of his neck and he could bark threw it. i used the one finger fits under the collar rule, and the dog panted extremely due to the collar being too tight. the third day of wearing the collar the operational box fell off the collar!!!!!! leaving the collar and the prongs and that was it. the glue used to hold the box in is a sillicone base and is not sturdy at all. of course my other dog found the box before i was aware it was missing and chewed it up! and the warrenty dose not cover damage due by dog, so three days later i have no collar and a barking dog again!!"
1,mediocre product,"piece of junk product. collar is inappropriate to hold the unit to the dogs neck. Its a flimsy piece of junk and barely holds the shocking component in place. When the collar can't hold the unit to the neck, the product is a failure. with such a wimpy nylon webbing collar, the unit fails more than it executes."
5,The collar stopped the barking,"Due to the problems I have had in the past with burned necks and a GSD who knew how many times he had to turn around to reset the collar, I didn't want to get one. But due the his barking needed to do something. In the past I admit to buying cheaper models.I compared many before ordering this one. It didn't take long for my dog to realize that he couldn't reset this collar. The warning busy now is all he needs. It is wonderful to have a quite house again. The collar was worth the price. The only problem was it did come with a battery that didn't last an hour. I talked to Amazon and the problem was settled very quickly."
1,Stopped working after a year,"UPDATE:This product stopped working after a year. Company wanted $40 to fix it.Old review:The collar is great. Plenty of length on the collar to fit all dogs. Has some nice settings (off, low, medium, higher, test mode). Has quick snap connector but also a buckle on it. The use of the buckle and connector is a bit weird how they have it setup but works."
2,Too expensive for the quality of product,At first the collar worked great but after a few months it would not go off everytime my dog barked. The batteries are too expensive and the knob is hard to turn on/off. Now it only works 1 out of 10 times. I'm angry I paid $60-$70 for a poor quality product.
2,"Doesn't stay on the throat, dog still barks",Maybe this works for some people but my dog just shakes his head until the box is on the side of his neck and then it can't sense his bark. These things should work with a microphone in my opinion. I have put it on really tight and he can still move it. He also has really thick fur so I have to shave his neck so he can feel the shock. It's just been a hassle from the start and the dog still barks. Don't get me wrong it worked at first but now that he knows how to move it to the side... lots of barking. I just got a citronella spray collar and it works much better because it works with a microphone.
1,Not worth the risk.,"Even if there is a 1-in-a-100 chance that this could happen to your dog, its not worth the risk! We bought this at petco, and it mostly worked for the first a night. Our collie-mix would bark once or twice and then stop. The next day we crated her in the morning and when we came home for lunch, she looked depressed and beaten. We were afraid that it was shocking her incorrectly while we were gone, but we weren't sure. When we took her out, as she was going down the front steps she yelped and yanked her head as if she had been shocked. All signs point to this thing shocking her for sudden movements not for barking. She is basically traumatized now and afraid of stairs. Dont buy the automatic one. Its just not worth it. Should change the company to ""usually pet safe"""
4,Just what I needed,"This is a good product for labeling jewerly. However, sometimes the pen would stop writing and I would write on an envelope or other paper and then I could continue. It does stick good.I would recommend to friend."
2,A book of disappointing puzzles,"This book is not about a mystery story, rather is a collection of puzzles. The main idea is that a group of friends (that call themselves the black widowers) meets monthly for dinner to enjoy converstation. Somehow, during these meeting, a puzzle always arise and the black widowers (with the help of the omnipresent waiter Henry) discuss how to solve it.Some of these puzzles concern crime but other simply deals with peculiar events or strange circumstances.The problem with this book is that the puzzles have nearly always a disappointing solution: at times is too obvious and at other does not make much sense. And even in the very few stories in which this is not the case I was not surprised by the cleverness of the solution.I am giving it two stars and not one because I have to admit that the puzzles on themselves do get your attention: it is just a pity that you will disappointed when you arrive at the end."
4,Just what the doctor ordered.,I bought this product for my customer. We have just started retrofit foaming houses. The critical issue is making sure that the humidity in the attic is being controlled properly after the foam has been installed. All of the bathroom exhaust fans must be filtered out of the attic to a soffit vent as well as the kitchen exhaust. In order for the customer to monitor their own attic we have started purchasing this product as part of the health and safety protocol.Happy to report that this product works excellent. I love the big display that is easy to see across the room.
5,Handy! And it Works.,"Handy because you can place the receiver/display just about anywhere in the house. And it worked the first time I installed batteries in the display and sensor even though I failed to heed the directions to install the sensor batteries first before the ""main unit."" The temperature readout seems to track several other thermometers both inside and outside and the humidity readout tracks local Internet weather sources. All things considered, the TM005X is worth every penny of its very reasonable price."
4,works as expected and good value,"Was fairly easy to install batteries and set up, and seems to be working well. My 1 outdoor transmitter is probably about 30 feet from receiving unit.Only change I would make is on the outdoor sensor...it has a small stand and i needed to find a location for it to stand out of weather...another, older type of outdoor thermometer I used had a bracket housing that the unit would clip into, so it could be mounted on an exterior wall or even under soffit, which is better I think."
1,Missing Tan puzzlw piece.,"The Tangram Puzzles book had only 6 of the 7 puzzle pieces.Even though the used item was wrapped in plastic andjammed in with two other books, it was packed missing the7th puzzle piece.Bummer!"
4,Good Educational Toy,"This Tangram set and book are very good quality. Tangrams are excellent learning tools for spatial understanding and problem solving. Because of the nature of this toy, it is much more versatile than regular puzzles. The same pieces are used over and over to solve the many different 'puzzles' which are presented in the book. (The solutions are also given at the back of the book.)I have only one criticism of this product. I wish it came with a container for the pieces."
2,Don't Bother With This Edition,"I have always been a tremendous fan of More; however, I would recommend not approaching ""Utopia"" with this edition. Although this is the cheapest version out there, I find it entirely lacking in footnotes, annotations, and other ""tools"" that help explain some of the nuances of More's argument.Instead of purchasing this edition, go for the Norton Critical Edition, which also contains some essays which help illuminate the text."
2,"Book Good, this edition Horrible","This was the first edition of this book that I bought, and it is almost completly unreadable. Granted this is a budget book; however, the quality is completly lacking. If you are going to buy this book, which you should, it is an excellent peice in understanding More's society, I recomend the Penguin edition."
2,broken,"The show is great. My daughter loves it and this DVD set was a birthday gift. One of the DVDs came completely broken in two. Otherwise, it was a good purchase."
4,Good Cd,"Good cd if you liked the music from the movie. Great if your really like the Mary J. Blige version of ""Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word"" - Couldn't find it on itunes or anywhere else."
3,A Song Missing,"Actually I rate this CD 3.5. I bought it in the stores because I love Bridget Jones and the music was good in the movie. I especially liked the song ""I belive in a thing called love"" by the Darkness which it says is on the CD but the copy I bought did not have it on there. Instead, it was replaced by ""My First, Last, Everything"" by Barry White. I like that song as well but am wondering if it is certain Imports of the CD that have different songs of them. Everything else was exactly as listed so...bizarre."
5,Captures the essence of Bridget Jones...,"I just saw Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, and I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack. I was thrilled to see Joss Stone, Robbie Williams, Beyoncé and Carly Simon were all part of the tracks. I especially like 'Your Love is King', by Will Young. It perfectly fits how Bridget and Mark feel for each other!This, along with the first Bridget Jones soundtrack, is a must own!"
5,great book,"this is a great book for anyone looking for quality photos, background stories, and inspiration for one of your own future paint jobs. i did not purchase this book from here but did recieve one from Cary Greenwood himself at or prior to release of this book. i used to work with Cary and let me tell you, these guys are truly the best at what they did. the text in the book cant compare to the stories i was told and experiences i had while working and hanging out with Cary before he passed away. i encourage you to buy one if you are an enthusiast at all, as this is truly a one of a kind book. i myself may purchase another for personal reasons"
4,Cute and efficient,We use the Boon for my daughter and she likes it. The toilet paper holder is clever. The guard is a pain to lower so we don't use it. I like that it can be used as a step stool later.
3,Just OK,"Sturdy and well made, but looked used. Maybe this was a previous return or either it sat in a box for years. Looked a little worn to me since the color was dulled and there were a couple black scuff marks on the white corners that won't come off. Otherwise I like the plainess and sturdiness of this potty."
1,This is junk!,"This carrier is junk, pure and simple. It's held together by flimsy plastic plug-like things that are likely to break or twist open in a heartbeat. No way am I carrying my pet in this."
5,This album rocks!,"I heard 'This is not a Love Song' on an indie station and HAD to have it. After a concerted search, I am happy to say I am not disappointed. It seems everyone fell short of liking 'Guns of Brixton', but it is one of my favorites. Yes, 'Too Drunk..' kinda falls short, but it is more than made up for on surrounding tracks. On HEAVY play here."
4,A passion beyond colecting.,"The author takes us for a visit to collectors homes, and allows us to have a look at their private assembly of objects, paintings and sculptures they are passionate about. We can view the art in its context, we can see the juxtaposition of objects and furniture as these are being used by its owners, without pretending, revealing more than just the art. We get a glimps at the interior design and decor layered just as life puts them together. Only real collectors can possibly understand the mania they are infected with, not being able to resist amassingthe fetishes of their desire."
2,Not Pete Kelly's band or arrangements,"As specified in my earlier reviews of this CD, if you looking for the music from the movie ""Pete Kelly's Blues"", the tunes are here but the music/band/arrangements aren't. I give it two stars only for Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald, although Peggy's arrangements are not the same as the movie. Ella is very good and authentic from the film. The band playing on this Japanese CD is not the one headed by Dick Cathcart, Matty Matlock, and Nick Fatool from the movie, LPs, radio-television programs, and a far cry from a good Dixieland band! This CD's major plus is including the words to the songs, but the label credits and information are in Japanese (which is quaint but not helpful). Unless you're a Peggy or Ella fan, it's not worth $[...],$[...], or $[...]!"
3,Seemingly varying degrees of readings.,This product seemed extremely low in its readings from past visits to the doctor's office. The representative was very courteous when I phoned about my misgivings and promptly sent me another one in exchange. This one is quite a bit higher than the other one but it is also quite higher than that taken by nurses. I chose the better of the two but am dubious as to the consistent and correct readings of this particular monitor.
4,sewing stems rips,"It's really affordable and accurate . But after 8 months of daily use (twice a day) the sewing lines torn a part. so no longer will it tighten up .You can order replacements only on their website. which cost under $20 with shipping.[...]The happy face and sad face makes it easy for my grandma who wasn't educated to know how her blood pressure is doing.It has an alarm , i guess so you can know when to do the test"
5,Hobby build,If you want a great model to build then F-117 Nighthawk is a great model to build and will look great on the shelf.
5,HeavyHands ...great arm workout,Looked all over NYC for these heavyHands...could only find them in the configuration I needed from Amazon- Thank you.....these aregreat for versatile arm workouts...every woman should have them.
1,It's French,"Don't fall for the ""language unknown"" remark. It's French and I don't have the interest or time to read subtitles. Fast forwarded through it and didn't seem interesting enough to bother with subtitles."
2,GOOD PICTURE (1080) BAD MOVIE,"UNLESS YOU BUY THE MOVIE IN BLU-RAY VERSION UNDER $ 5.00 DO IT !, OTHERWISE DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY"
4,Audrey Tautou is Priceless,"This is essential to viewing to any fan of Audrey Tautou's growing body of work. Excellent production with great performances and direction, this not-to-be-taken-too-seriously film matches beautiful locations with equally stunning views of an accomplished actress most have yet to discover. Thankfully, this was not an American production so no killings or special effects and thank goodness I'll finally have a region 1 version I can loan to my friends. The international version has been available for about 12 months."
4,Dublin,"Excellent read, Rutherford does it again with brilliant detail and story lines which i found made it difficult for me to put the book down. Great read."
1,Dublin,"Was excited to find a book from Edward Rutherford that I had not read. Really bummed when I realized that it was the same book as The Princes of Ireland, but with a new name. Now I have 2 copies of the same book. Really feel rather cheated."
5,I want more,I love this author. His detail is priceless & perfect. I feel lke I'm lving along with the people as they go thru their lves & adventures. Then I miss them when I've fiished the book
4,Edward Rutherfurd's Ireland Awakening,"I very much enjoyed the Rebels of Ireland and was looking for more of Rutherfurd's books to read. I ordered Ireland Awakening thinking it was a different book.... it's not! It is Rebels of Ireland under a different title. Thought this ""head's up"" would be helpful."
3,Maybe the new edition is better,"It's too bad many errors that should have been caught by a knowledgeable proofreader mar this (printing of this) book. Perhaps the new edition is better (did you see the prices that sellers want for this old edition? OMG). I sure hope so. I certainly know how the author feels (been there, done that), but what makes him any more of an expert than me (okay, so he did take the time to write a book and I haven't)? At any rate I'm still waiting for THE ULTIMATE Chevelle restoration book, something like Paul A. Hurd's ""Chevelle SS Restoration Guide"" BUT WITHOUT ALL THE ERRORS!"
5,Portable and NOT in ear.,This is a good product to buy if your buying criteria include1. Should fit in your pocket easily.2. Should not touch/rub the inside of your ear.3. Should be cheap (less than $20)
1,Not worth the money,"Purchased these from Radio Shack on clearance for $5.99. I thought ""what the heck"". Flimsy, difficult to put on and very average sound. Used with my Creative Zen vision M and was not impressed at all. My Skull candy 'Inked earbuds are 10 times better."
1,"Ok, but I had a couple problems.","The connecting point where the hook goes into the headphone is loose, so they don't stay in place very well. The sound quality is OK, but because it wont clamp onto the ear well enough I lost a lot of sound definition which made it sound pretty crappy overall. My primary problem with headphones is the cord that connects to the Mp3 player stops working because it rips at the base of the plug. I bought these about 3 months ago and the where the cord connects to the metal plug has completely come undone. I think it may be because I wrap my headphones around my Mp3 player before I put it in my pocket. But nonetheless, this cord didn't last near as long as some of the cheaper headphones I've purchased."
3,"Not the greatest, but is sufficient for my purpose","Pros:-Stay hooked on my ears. Perfect for running!-Cheap!Cons:-The biggest disappointment is that the left hook was very LOOSE the moment I got it out of the box, I didn't bother returning it because it's a hassle and the product wasn't that costly. Although it is loose, it never actually falls off the earphone.The ""okays""-sound quality isn't top notch, but you get what you pay for"
2,painful and fragile,"I much prefer outside-the-ear headphones, even when working out, and I've long been a fan of Koss. The KSC75s, however, were not a good purchase. At first they were so tight that they hurt my ears. Then, as they loosened, the arms that hold them in place began to pop off. They can be re-attached, but they get looser and looser every day. I've had my pair almost three months and doubt they will last another three.[update, 12/20/2011. Three months and a day, and they're totally broken. I won't be buying another pair]."
3,Didn't work with my ears,"I've always used the over-the-head headphones when I go running and thought I'd try something a little more ""hip"" but earbuds don't stay in my ears. So, I tried these. The sound seems fine but I'm not an audiophile. The pads on the part that is in front of your ear are comfy. But the part that sits behind the ear didn't work on my shaped ears. The bottom part of the hook pushed my earlobe out, it felt weird enough and uncomfortable enough that I'll be returning them. Instead I ordered the Philips Adjustable Earclip Headphones SHS4700/28 (Black). I like that the ear hook is shorter, it doesn't reach my earlobe and it's hinged so I can adjust it to squeeze my ear or not. I couldn't figure out how the Koss were adjustable and I didn't want to break them thus voiding a return. Bottom like, it's ear to ear on how they'll fit."
5,Great headphones,"For the price, you can't beat them. I integrated these into my motorcycle helmet and they work great with the FIIO 6 and the FIIO L9 LOD cable. With this combonation, they work and sound great and are plenty loud enough to over power the many noises of riding a motorcycle."
3,This product is so so,"Pro: Sound is goodCons: Too fragile, not comfortableAnyway, it is kinda fair. But only use it like 6 times and it broke"
3,Great sound poor quality/craftsmanship,"dollar for dollar, these are incredible sounding headphones. But I am replacing my second pair after 6 months of use or so just a couple times per week in the gym because of an unbearable crackling noise that develops. They do have a lifetime warranty which is cool, but you have to pay $9 for shipping - which is about the same price as the headphones themselves. They also are not super comfortable, but i think i finally got used to them after a year or so."
5,Great headphones with lots of Bass,I really like these headphones. Mine did break after a few weeks. The right headphone just stopped working for no reasons. I tried another pair and I did not like them as much. I am going to order another pair of these Koss.
4,Worth it for the money,"I had some older sony headphones of the same over-ear type that went bad a month ago, so I decided to pick these up due to the price and good reviews. Having used them for several weeks now, I can definetly agree with other reviews. First of all, the sound quality is great. I've never had any type of earbuds that sound this good, and these perhaps sound better then my old Sony's. The weak point of these headphones is mainly in their exterior construction. I have to admit they are relatively cheaply made, and the fact that the ear-clip detaches from the speaker is a bit lame because it's possible to take them off and snap the clip off, dropping it somewhere to never be found again. Overall however, for the money I'm very satisfied with these phones. If your looking for something maybe a little better built, I would go with some Sony's."
4,Great overall value,"I recently received my Koss KSC75's from Amazon, and I must say that I'm impressed. The sound quality met the expectations set by prior reviewers. Surprisingly clean bass and a clear, open top end.These headphones are also very light. When listening to my iPod, I was accustomed to a set of Sennheiser earbuds. They sounded good but they were uncomfortable. I prefer the KSC75's for two reasons: 1) I don't feel like I'm getting jammed in the ear and 2) they stay in place!I did however have some difficulty in getting the KSC75's to fit properly at first. By bending the metal wire within the ""ear hooks,"" I was able to get a good fit for my left ear. They do occasionally come loose if I'm exercising, but I'd rather have that than a tight fit."
2,Attaching piece falls off too easily,"Bought two of these, one as a gift. On the gift pair the piece that hooks on to the ear broke on its second day. I first thought it must be the receivers fault, but then it happened to me too. I was able to repair my own pair, but I now believe it is a flaw in design. I haven't yet got around to seeing if Koss or Amazon will replace the broken pair, at the low price its hardly worth the effort to resend them. Otherwise, the sound is good, and they are comfortable."
1,Flimsy with modest sound,I used these for a week while working out. The fit is very poor and the clips keep on snapping off when you try to adjust it. My older Phillips SHS4700 are much more suited for active wear. Sound quality is over rated for the price.
5,Good replacement for portapro drivers,"On my second pair. Both have been used to replace the drivers on my portapros. They have the same mount, and therefore snap right on to the portapro headband. The sound quality is also comparable. i've broken two previous pairs, all my fault."
2,Poor customer service,I was not quite sure whether I was wearing these headphones correctly as they were quite uncomfortable and I struggled to get then to fit properly so I emailed customer service and asked them to send me a diagram of how to wear these as there was no instructions that came along with the product. Never received a reply. I will never buy another Koss product again.
2,Major let down,"I am female runner and I was recently doing research to find a pair of running headphones that would stay put on my ears. I must have small ears, but earbuds to not work for me and I have a lot of luck with this style of headphones (ear clips). This is truly my first review because I felt like a had a responsibility to inform other female consumers, with smaller ears I suppose for these clips, that these were VERY disappointing. The clips were not very user friendly for they barely snapped in place. When I thought I had them pressed down far enough to stay put, I would start my run and find myself constantly trying to make them snap tighter on my ear because they kept bouncing loose. Ultimately I owned a pair for two weeks and ended up breaking them while trying to press the clip tighter around my ear. I am now purchasing Sennheiser's PMX 680s."
3,Didn't work for me,"There are many positive reviews about sound quality of this product. My long-time favorite headphones are Sony MDR-J10 (at the price point). Even though I am quite happy with the sound from J10, I wanted to see if the KSC75 offer better sound. I am not impressed with the sound from KSC75. The sound from J10 is way better than the KSC75. J10 are also more comfortable than KSC75. The foam cushions of KSC75 tend to create sweat and also pinch a little bit. The J10 buds sit in the ear and don't create sweat. The J10 are also very good even there is moderate noise around you. The hooks on KSC75 are thicker than those of J10. I wear eye-glasses. The glasses don't fit well with KSC75. To top it all, the J10 cost $7 less than the KSC75."
1,Hate udder Hate,"These headphones are awful. They don't clip to my ears, they are heavy and fall off all the time, they cause MASSIVE Static in my hair, and the sound quality does not impress. I went by all of the good reviews but wish I would've just stuck with the Phillips i know and love. These are uncomfortable and totally NOT WORTH IT. I am taking scissors to them and buying a pair of Phillips as soon as I sign off."
2,4 months and a blown speaker,"Purchased these based on the positive reviews. I don't ask a lot of my headphones, but a rattling ""speaker"" after 4 months seems like a lot less quality than I would expect in this price range, and from this manufacturer. I do not abuse my headphones, don't turn them up very loudly and secure them neatly for transport. I'm going back to the less than $10 variety, which usually last me about 2 years, and this set is going in the trash. These headphones also have a tendency for the speaker to unsnap from the earpiece hook. This worried me at first, but then just became annoying. All around, disappointing."
1,No sound after little use,"Sound fine while they lasted.After about 2 years of very limited use these failed, first on one side and now both sides. Limited lifetime warranty but ""service"" requires the payment of $9.00 for return shipping. This is virtually what I paid.Poor quality from what used to be a top notch brand."
3,A little bulky,"These stay on my ears better than iPod earbuds, but these are pretty bulky. Functional, yes, fashionable - no. At least the cord was pretty lengthy!"
3,Better than buds...but not so much!,"I ordered these headphones because my Panasonic clips were left on a plane. When worn, they look a bit ""robotic"" and stick out. That's not the biggest problem. The clip and earphone rotate and move for a good fit, but the clip will separate from the headphone when they are stored or you over adjust them. It is difficult to snap them back without breaking them. Therefore they are bulky, problematic for traveling. I hope to replace them soon when the Panasonic ones get back in stock."
4,Good sound and comfortable,"The headphones have good sound, better than my last set. They're more comfortable than they look, too. I wear headphones when I walk, so being able to hear what's going on outside is a good thing, so I like wearing over the ear phones over ear buds which seem to muffle everything even when the volume is low. When I wear them for more than an hour or so, they get kind of uncomfortable, but I really haven't found a set of headphones (portable or otherwise) that don't.My only real complaint is that the phones are kind of big. They don't seem to fit inside cases I've tried (including a few different sized Altos mint tins). Having my phones in a case of some sort when I'm not wearing them seems to help them last longer in my experience. I'm also worried that the foam pads will wear out before the headphones do.Overall, though, I'm very happy with my purchase.Over a"
3,Good decent headphones,"These headphones are a nice cheap alternative for me due to my inability to use earbuds. Other clip-ons usually leak out sound so people constantly ask you to turn down the music. The sound quality is beautiful with nice bass which can be appreciated by both me and other people who bought these. The only bad thing I'd have to say about these headphones is the ear clip-on. The clips aren't adjustable so I have to wedge my ear into it, having to tug on my earlobe to pull them snugly on to a point they won't fall off. After awhile the fact my ear is wedged in hits my brain and my ear starts to pain, other then the nonadjustable earclip its a very nice set of headphones for people who can't do earbuds."
3,"Good sound, good comfort, not ready to wear","The earphones arrived promptly and the sound quality is great, especially for the price point. They are comfortable - I was looking to move away from ear buds without having to commit to over the head earphones which seem cumbersome for commuting, etc. Initially, it did take quite a bit of wrangling and adjusting to put the headphones on and while I have that part figured out, it's still a tad annoying to have to remove them quickly, like say, when the phone rings or someone comes by at work.So, over-all: good sound quality and comfort for day to day use with some cons: takes some negotiation to get them on and off and privacy (if you're someone who likes a higher decibol)."
4,Lifetime warranty is useless,"The sound quality on these things is great, especially for the price. The earclips are very lightweight yet they stay on very securely (I go running with them). However, six years after I bought them, the sound in the left earpiece is starting to go out. I think it's a wiring problem, since if I jiggle the wire the right way, the sound will come back.Koss offers a lifetime warranty, but I would have to pay to ship the headphones to them and include a check for $9 for the return shipping. For that combined price, I could buy a new set of these headphones! The lifetime warranty may be good for more expensive items, but not this one."
2,Cheap and good but utterly unreliable,"I've owned four pairs of these over the years. My cat chewed through the cord of the first one, and since they're so cheap I decided to buy another pair. In the second pair, the sound went dead in the left ear after a month or so. I figured maybe the cat had been at that one, too, although I couldn't see any bite marks, so like a fool I bought a third pair, a fourth for my girlfriend as well. These we were very careful to store away from any felines, and both had the same problem within a month.For the price, sure, these sound fine and are perfectly comfortable. But considering that in my (admittedly anecdotal) experience they have a 75% failure rate within the first month or two, well, how cheap does it have to be before having to buy a new pair every time they break catches up to you?"
2,Completley outclassed,"Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone HeadphonesDon't be fooled by their similar design to the Sony and Panasonic clip-on headphones. I've owned a few pairs of Koss KSC75 clip-on headphones. There's no comparison. These headphones have THE WORST sound quality. It's muffled, and doesn't respond well to bass. They're also very fragile. I've had these break literally 10 minutes after I took them out of the package. Also, the clip is very awkwardly placed.There is a reason why you see these headphones cheaper than the rest in retail electronic stores. However, since they're around the same price on Amazon, I definitely recommend going with Sony MDR-Q22LP clip-on headphones instead."
5,Great for the gym,"I bought these things for the gym and they pack quite the punch for $15. I own some Shure SE530s, Denon D2000s, and of course some stock iPod buds. These little things are the best bang for your buck and work great at the gym.I actually ended up losing the clips that come with these so I couldn't wear them for a while. I decided to just email Koss' customer service and ask if I could order some replacements, they said yes and they shipped some out to me.... free of charge!"
2,Great sound quality but very uncomfortable to wear,I did my research for the best headphone and the Koss KSC75 came up as one of the best one. The sound quality is amazing. You can hear all the base that you never heard of when you use crappy headphones. There is a problem for me is that they won't stay. I need them when I go work out and they keep falling off. I ended up running with my hands on my ears to hold the headphone. Very inconvenience!! Also someone has mentioned that the headphones tend to trap the heat and the sweat when you work out so it's not very pleasant at all. I would highly recommend to buy this headphones if you are indoor and stay still or when you're on a bus or plane. It's not good if you need it for work out at all.
1,Broke after a week,"These headphones are very flimsy. The earphone came off the plastic stem in less than a week. I can't judge the sound quality, because it busted so quickly. The fit over the ear was uncomfortable. The price was good. I got less value out of it than other cheap headphones, though."
5,Awesome Portable Stereophone Headphones,I just bought this item a couple of days ago and I am very happy with its astonishing sound quality.The sport clips fits nicely around each ear. The sound quality is just awesome. I love it.
4,Solid Portable Headphones - Great Value!,"I've tried many different types of headphones to use with my Ipod at the gym or while running. All have some form of shortcoming: not comfortable; dull or flat sound; great sound but leaving me feeling like I've damaged my hearing just a bit more (earbuds). These KOSS headphones have amazing sound, sit outside the ear and are pretty comfortable to wear, once you figure out how to put them on. They're a great value for the money.Pros:1. Clear sound - not tinny or weak, decent bass2. Comfortable for longer periods (although so far I've only had them on for a max of 45 min)3. InexpensiveCons:1. Initially hard to figure out how to put them on (gets easier over time)2. They're not as good as these cansSennheiser HD800 Over-Ear Circum-Aural Dynamic Premiere HeadphoneI'd definitely buy them again, and I'd recommend them to a friend."
1,Too big,"I ordered these headphones because the reviews said they would stay put during physical activity. I already know I have small ears so I was skeptical, and unfortunately for small ears they are terrible. They are too large and barely stay put during a walk. Didn't get a chance to even test out the sound quality, but definitely wouldn't recommend these for small eared runners."
2,Not worth it,Sound escapes to everyone around you even at lower volumes. Very poor quality of sound: no highs or lows. Ear clip doesn't really open for placement and is hard plastic.
3,Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones,"The sound on these are excellent but they fit a bit looser than the Philips Adjustable Earclip Headphones SHS4700/28 (Black), I hike, walk and run a lot and these are a bit too loose for that. Instead I use these to work around the yard and the others for working out."
5,Great Over the Ear Headphones!,"I've had these for several years and the foam pieces are starting to wear, but the speakers still work great. One wire is starting to come out of one earpiece because I've gotten caught on my office chair and that's yanked them out some. My fault on that part. I've been wanting to get a replacement, but I remember when I got them they were in the five range. I hope the price drops sometime so I can get a new pair."
2,"Sounds is fine, fit is terrible","I'm not terribly picky about sound and these sounded just fine to me. However, the clips on these headphones are enormous and no matter how I try to adjust them I can't get them to stay on my ears. I've owned several of this style headphone before and never had this problem. I don't use them for exercising, just walking around casually during the day, and they simply don't stay in place. I also don't particularly like the clip attachment which feels very cheap and easily pops off."
3,Good Sound but No In-Line Volume,"I purchased these because the product information indicated in-line volume. From looking at pictures others had posted, I could not tell for certain whether it had in-line volume control or not. I was very disappointed when they arrived without in-line volume control because that was the reason I purchased them. The ear clip is rather bulky. I don't think the average person would notice that if the headphones were being used while exercising or casual listening. If you are trying to put a helmet over them though, it becomes tricky."
1,Not the complete book. DO NOT PURCHASE,I ordered this version of the book expecting a rendering of the complete edition. This version ends midway through chapter XIV. The reproduced illustrations are of poor quality as well. Really should be rated 0 stars
1,Disappointed,I thought this was the perfect gift for my two sons who are Yankee fans with girlfriends who are Red Sox fans. Unfortunately I was sent a Yankee vs. Mets game and the supplier policy was that I had to order and pay for a new game before another game was sent and then wait for a credit. The shipping manager was rude and I just decided to not try not to reorder. The second game was inadvertently sent to my son's old address but was returned. The supplier did promptly credit my account for both games but I would have preferred the games.
5,Finally! Yippieeeeeeee!,"Oh my God! I have prayed for so long for the second season to be released. I did not miss any episode of Soul Food when it was on Showtime and it was my only reason for subscribing to Showtime. Soul Food had a strong fan base and they felt slighted by Paramont for not releasing more seasons. I am one of many who have sent emails and phone calls and I will not stop until all seasons are released. Yes, it did air on BET but the shows are not shown in order and there are too many comercials and deleted scenes.I cannot wait until my order comes because I plan to watch it immediately.Please tell all your friends to purchase this DVD set (not the bootleg copies) in order for Paramont to continue releasing the other seasons."
5,Finally..........,"Our patience has finally paid off...............they are releasing season two. It's been a hellified long wait, but thankfully it's ending. I sure hope it doesn't take as long for the release of the other seasons.This was really a great show. I watch the re-runs on BET and get so caught up as if it's my first time and I don't know how it'll end."
2,Imaginative!,Marc Phoenix has a fascinating book going in this one. There's obviously a series in his future! Imaginative storyline. . . .
2,Easy to use but highly disappointing!,"I knew that this MP3 player was too good to be true.It worked pproperly for the first day then started to go haywire. The scan button gets stuck so each time you skip a song,it thinks you just want to fast forward.It juices the battery like you wouldnt believe and the FM tuner function completely shuts down the player and you can turn the player on for hoours after that!I have tried to contact Coby and have yet to get a real reply.Any warranty work takes 6-8weeks to repair or replace.Try explaining 6-8 weeks to a 7 year old.I only bought this cause it was a good MAC alternative to the IPOD,but low and behold I am going to purchase an IPOD. Do not buy this product,it is not worth the hassle."
1,Not worth the money!,"Had it for less than two weeks and the player no longer works. The player would shut off for no reason occasionally and then finally it had a total malfunction. Customer service only had one solution and that was to reformat it on my computer but the computer would not recognize it being there. Had trouble with switching between songs with the toggle switch. the headphones are bad to use, sound quality is ugly to say the least. You get what you pay for!!"
3,RE: 1988 jeep Wrangler Sahara,"This book may or may not have been well researched. On page 81 a caption for a photograph reads ""In 1990 Jeep introduced the Wrangler 'Saraha'."" I know this to be untrue because I have the original factory window sticker for my 1988 Jeep Wrangler Sahara. Other than that this book was a good read."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie whose iconic nature has prevented many people from realizing that it's actually a rather poor film, Dracula is only worth watching to see Bela Legosi provide the definitive version of the world's most famous vampire; aside from Legosi the movie has little to offer besides lethargic pacing, a complete anti-climax of an ending, and uninspired direction by Tod Browning."
1,unable to stream glass version,"I had seen the version with the Phillip Glass soundtrack on cable, and I loved it. I was hoping to show my wife, but it seems the streaming version is the original, without any soundtrack. Too bad, as I really enjoyed the new soundtrack."
5,movie,5 stars for this anniversary edition is great.The oldies are the best.So go out and get it now
5,Dracula Going For The Throat,"Bela Lugosi's Dracula was a spectacle I've always enjoyed. Never before has an actor's own personality so merged with a single character. There are three granddaddies of Dracula: Voivode Vladislaus Dracula, Bram Stoker, and Bela Lugosi. There have been Draculas before and since Lugosi, but he is the one that has become a cultural icon. His was a commanding presence, a slight androgeny, and stiff mien of a nobleman or corpse. He had extended fingers which were like the claws of a predator, or a puppeteer. His intonation was slow and deliberate like a hypnotist, which he had played earlier in the German movie Sklaven Fremdes Willens (Slaves of a Foreign Will). Lugosi was no cuddly evil like Chaney Sr., or Karloff, he figurtively went for the throat."
4,"awesome DVD, OK movie","The English version of the movie is the least of the early Universal Horror pictures, or atleast I think so. If you disagree, you MUST buy this DVD however. It is seriously cool. It features THREE versions of the movie. It has the Spanish language version, shot simultaneously with different actors, the original English Lugosi one and the same one rescored with Philip Glass music. The Spanish one is my favorite. The Philip Glass score sometimes helps, but more often detracts. Sometimes it's hard to hear the dialogue over it. Sometimes the silence is creepier in the original. It's nice that they offer it as an option, unlike the video version."
3,"good for a film, bad for the novel","the film itself is comparable to 1931 acting and is good in itself, however, don't look to the film to understand what the story of the novel is; it is completely different."
2,Could have been much better,"The DVD of the English-language Bela Legosi version is FAR too compressed in my opinion. The picture is grainy and there is alot of digital ""noise"" (dithered pixelation in multi-hues). The image quality is not crisp but is rather dark and very fuzzy.The Spanish-language version, by contrast, is a much better picture, obviously sampled at a higher rate and with less compression. Why would the producers of this DVD spend more time (and valuable disk space) for the Spanish version of the film is beyond me! I mean, how many of you reading this would actually buy it for the obscure Spanish version versus the ultra-classic Bela Legosi version? Put the Spanish version on a separate disk next time, or on the flip-side and compress the main feature less."
4,Not exactly powder,Not powder is a more appropriate heading. This product is more like large grandules. I say that because if you're looking for powdered this isn't it. Nonetheless this works quite well. A rating of 4 for the product description and a 5 for the product itself.
5,Highly recommended,"These pull-ups are very absorbent, work great for overnight use. They are not as bulky as the others I tried and worked well under pants.These do not have the smooth plastic trash liner look/feel of others. They have a cloth feel, so they feel more like clothes to my son. They also are not so hot and sweaty as this fabric like material seems to breathe.Highly recommended!"
5,Everyday Life During the Civil War,"Timely delivery. Copy of book had been borrowed from public library. Knew value of information, so purchased own copy. Very helpful material."
3,This Is Not the Book,"This book would be amazing if the information was correct. A lot of statistics are wrong. Perhaps this book had been written with a very strict deadline or they did not have fact checkers. The book isn't really about 'Everyday Life', the fashion section shows a dress that no average woman could have worn or could have afforded. They show a dress that was really only meant for teenagers and children. I would suggest "" An Introduction to Civil War Civilians"" by Juniata Leisch. It is cheaper and gives a better insight."
5,A great self-paced text,"I took this class last summer with this text. Mr. Ross' instruction is so clear and well done, I didn't need help ONCE. Also entertaining, clever narrative etc. I felt this text gave me a good handle on the subject matter. I did so well with the self paced aspect, I finished before half the term was over (with an 'A') and enrolled in another class."
2,Very unstable in Battlefield 2,"I just bought this joystick. After configuring it on Win XP SP2. It recognized the device, was easily calibrated, and easily allocated onto BF2. When the game-play started my trigger didn't work. After restarting in another server, my trigger worked, but then my yaw (joystick twist) and all the secondary thumb buttons as well as the 8 way hat did not respond. I still have no idea as to what might be causing the conflict.On a second note, I bought this joystick as an upgrade to my logiteck attack 3. Mostly because I wanted a joystick that I can twist for in-flight yaw motion. The first thing I noticed was that the stick is like a broom stick. Unlike logitech's pistol grip design, Saiteck make it difficult to use the thumb input buttons. It's difficult for me to expain it without you having tactile experience with both sticks, but I'm planning on going back to Logitech."
4,saitek joystick rules,"I just got this joystick like a week ago and it rocks it took me less than a minute to install it, i bought this joystick for my pacific fighter games and am looking forward for mfs2004. the only problem with this joystick is there is no landing gear button so i had to alwas use the keybord."
4,Almost perfect,"Does not function with Microsoft Fighter Ace II, but works with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004, do not know why. And it is not as comfortable as it looks. But otherwise is OK."
3,Cheap and Functional,"Here's the deal this a cheap functional joystick with very few buttons. That means that if you're playing any Sim style games (Mechwarrior, Freespace, flight sim, ect), You've got a joystick to fly with, but that doesn't mean you're going to be using it for more than that, all of the wrest of controls are still on your keyboard The throttle is a letdown, it's sturdy, but being on the rear in the center sucks, the joystick doesn't seem like it would hold up for super long, I bought it to bide time until I could get a Steel Battalion controller and a Xbox to USB converter, If you're not a hardcore Sim fan this joystick is worth the money, anyone looking to get more function should look elsewhere. That being said the rudder twist is fairly sensitive and takes alittle getting used to, but once you do it's actually the most pleasant thing about the joystick."
1,Do yourself a favor and buy something else...,"I bought the 290 Pro about 1-1/2 months ago. Already, the hat switch and the z-axis quit working. I've completely re-installed everything and nothing. I've contacted Saitek ""support"" and nothing. They say that they don't have problems with their hardware...just the installation. All I know is I should not have bought this.Good Luck."
3,Very informative read.,Very helpful in my quest to find out more about myself and recovery. I would recommend this book to anyone who suffers from food addiction or in denial about it.
5,A great question!,"The struggle to lose weight ends as soon as you open this book. You'll want to read it in one sitting. Danowski provides simple, practical tools for achieving freedom from devastating yo-yo dieting tactics. The solution? Pick up the book and find out why. You won't be sorry you did."
5,Post-Polio Syndrome,I am now taking charge of my Post Polio Syndrome thanks to the better understanding I have of my disease. Any one who has had Polio needs to read this book.
1,Suction Cup Magnifying Spot Mirror,"Besides being very difficult to use, I can't seem to get the suction cups to work."
1,Do not buy this,"Terrible. The interview is not very insightful. As the prior reviewer said, it is short, of very poor sound quality, and abrupt. And, again, not very insightful. You won't listen to this more than once. I can't believe MK consented to release of this."
1,Bad Product,"Don't buy these bowls. They look great and are a great size, but the bottom turns gray, any liquid seeps through because they are not properly glazed."
5,So what's the problem?,"I love this mouse. For its price, it's great. It's easy to clean, weighted perfectly, has good control, and being an optical mouse, has a high malfunction speed.I'm not sure how anyone could have trouble installing the drivers. It really doesn't take a computer nerd to install this properly. I had absolutely no problems installing the software and the software itself is very well organized and easy to use. Whatever. These people below having problems with the software probably shouldn't be using a mouse, hehe.Oh, back to the mouse. Yeah, it's nice. Fits my hand perfectly. The software has only bugged up on me once out of my 7 or so months of having this (the scroll wheel wouldn't scroll half the time I tried to move it), and it was easily fixed by a restart. My only concern is that you can't map a letter/number key onto the mouse through the mouse's software, which would rule for computer games. Oh well, it's still a great mouse."
4,Fierce Wisdom by Chloe Goodchild,"I highly recommended this beautiful and powerful CD, ""Fierce Wisdom"" to anyone aspiring to open more to the innate wisdom of the Sacred Feminine or anyone whom needs encouragement on their spiritual path. The CD is inspiring, entertaining, creative and filled with joy and sung in love by Chloe."
5,I Knew It Ahead Of Time,I love the product and that is why I ordered it again. Great taste and great price too. I have never been disappointed with this brand and price.
4,An excellent joystick overall,"A very nice joystick. The tripod legs give it exceptional stability. I can't remember it ever tipping over when I spin ridiculously in my Jane's USAF (A very good game, by the way).The only serious problem I have with it is the throttle. It was a great idea, but it's one of those things that looks good on paper but doesn't work in real life. It isn't very precise in adjusting. A quick tap will send you up or down roughly 30%. This is a problem when my flight instructor (in the game, of course) says, 'You'll need about 80% thrust to get it moving.'Of course, if you can control your throttle with your keyboard, it isn't really a problem at all.Pros:Excellent stabilityresponsivelooks coolfolding legsCons:Bad ThrottleOnly 3 buttons"
3,Just ok,"The book has some ideas for pulling together a nice village. However, I think the average user is less interested in how to coordinate the colors of their village in an artsie-fartsie way and more interested in details on how to contruct a village background, how to hide cords, ideas for storage, et. The book does give a couple of examples, but more detail in this area would be more helpful. Overall though it is not a bad book and worth getting as a beginner if for no other reason than I didn't find anything else out there that was better."
2,it's Friday the 13th,It's a good holloween movie. If your not looking for a brain teaser movie and just want to have fun this is a good choice.
5,a sacred journey within discovering my inner self,"As so many of us look outside ourselves for ways of reaching the understanding and meaning to our lives, David Feinstein and Stanley Krippner, provide us with a sacred journey through which we discover our inner self. A Mythic Path is a Psycho-spiritual journey through which self appreciation, respect and love is ultimately embraced. Each stage provides a path through which you reach this ultimate experience. It is a comprehensible program designed to help the layman and the professinal. As a spiritual counselor who experienced this program first hand, I can attest to it's validity, not only in my life, but in my own personal practice as well. Thank you for your wisdom......"
5,The Mythic Path: Discovering the Guiding Stories of Your Past-Creating a Vision for Your Future,"The Mythic Path: Discovering the Guiding Stories of Your Past-Creating a Vision for Your FutureAccording to ""Personal Mythology,"" life may not be the adventure we originally thought, and we need magic to steer clear of conventional thinking, signifying a limited scope of who we really are. But how do we avoid this?Renowned psychologists, Stanley Kripner, PhD and David Feinstein, PhD, begin by making reference to a common path called the earth experience, through which we charter an extraordinary journey using the oversoul's narrative accessible through our dreams, ritual and imagination.David and Stanley's ""Personal Mythology"" is a workbook with creative exercises to inspire imagination, so that life has more meaning, accomplished while unfolding the inner story -- with less emphasis on the actual story, but with more emphasis on the process of self-discovery."
4,Praxis exam preparation,"used the book to prepare for the Praxis II exam for technology education. I found it very useful, clear, and concise."
4,A very good album from QMS,"Quicksilver Messenger Service (Quicksilver) / Comin Thru: Still not the masterpiece they were always looking for, but this early 1970's attempt is very entertaining and well worth owning. This is a four star album."
1,Don't buy bootlegs.,"While I do not actually possess this recording, I can tell you right now that you should not ever buy it. Baktabak is not U2's label. U2's initial Irish releases were on CBS (U2:3, Another Day, and 11 O'clock Tick Tock within Ireland), and then they switched to Island with the 23 May 1980 outside-Ireland release of 11 O'clock Tick Tock. In the US, they are represented by Interscope, a division of Universal (who also own Island). U2 has no relation to Baktabak - this is an unofficial, unauthorised bootleg release and U2 do not receive any profit.I have nothing against unofficial recordings. I possess many concerts and interviews myself. However, NO-ONE should ever profit from bootlegging. If you want a copy of this, organise an equal trade - many in the fan world will be happy to do this. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOTLEG. Amazon should not be selling it."
1,"Sort of an OK idea, poor product",If this could actually plug into your computer it might be OK--but it's practically useless to mount it over your keyboard.My 8 month old did think the little plastic doo-dad (not electronic at all) that mounts to your keyboard was colorful and she beat on it for a second but then she started to try to use the keyboard under it (the one Mommy and Daddy use!).One positive thing--it works after you throw the colorful keyboard away--just banging away on the regular keyboard (which my daughter loves to do) activates the fun graphics on the computer screen.
1,"One Star, Maybe","This is a remarkably disappointing book on an outstanding furniture company.To have missed the opportunity of including many of Dunbar's most important pieces is not just negligent, but a crime. Missing are classics like: the rolltop desk, the famous contemporary wing chair, the bentwood chaise and the elegant upholstered model 971 chair series.This should not be confused with a collectors reference book, as it isn't one.The illustrations consist solely of muddy, fuzzy, apparently unresearched reproductions of old Dunbar catalogs.Also missing is a proper account of the lore of the company."
4,Tummy fun,"My daughter has really enjoyed this mat. In the beginning she would just sort of check out the fish(she looooves fish), but over time her ability to interact with it has greatly increased. Now-4mnths- she pushes around on the fish with great joy even making fun bubbles. It is a great first tummy time toy. The pillow velcros on so you can remove it if your little one wants to practice holding themselves up or just for a wash. As far as the new water everyday thing goes. I was good about that in the beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something. It turns out nothing horrible will happen if you don't change it very often. Actually the ability to empty it is helpful if you plan on taking it with to say grandma's house. Very easy to roll up and take with unlike our playmat. The little sun could be easier to activate bubble noise. A little hard for the little bitty ones. Toys are still good for crinkling and chewing though."
4,Content is good and straight to the point,The production of the video is not the best. but the content is good. She concentrates the most important movements and I can feel how it works in my body. It is always a plus to have few more videos to avoid boredom.
5,TETRA POND FLATING POND STICKS,GREAT BUY!!!! I HAVE BEEN BUYING THIS AT MY LOCAL PET STORE AND FOUND THAT THE FISH WERE EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AHD HOME. SINCE I NOW HAVE AT LEAST 100 FISH ON OUR OUTDOOR POND THEY WERE COSTING US TOO MUCH. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BIGGER PONDS. I'LL BE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!JUDY CALDWELL
5,Couldn't live without it!,"My girls are 18 months apart, this stroller was one of the best purchases I have ever made. It folds easily and fits in my car and is the only stroller I have ever owned, and I've owned about 10, that i can easily manuever with one hand. That means that when the baby is grouchy and refuses to sit in the stroller on the way back to the car, I can hold her on my hip and stear the stroller loaded with my toddler and all our gear with no problem. There are occasionally doors we don't fit through unless we open up the door next to it, but again the stroller is so manueverable its really not a big deal. I was worried about the reviews that talked about kids not being able to sit up all the way, but my girls, who are usually very finicky about that kind of thing, have never had an issue with it. They love the smooth ride and have no problem sitting side by side."
4,Double jogging stroller,"This should be a great stroller since I have a 3 yr. old and right now 3 mo. old. I thought maybe there was a stoller caddy included with the stroller since it showed in the photos, but I was disappointed that it did not come with a nice hard plastic one - it only came with a soft smaller one. I did purchase a stroller caddy for the handle bar, but it is also one made out of the nylon instead of being plastic. This double stroller is also a little heavy, but I guess they are all around 35 lbs. I am looking forward to using it at the zoo and traveling once my son is 6 mos. old."
4,Great,"This stroller was a great purchase for us - it rolls very smoothly and is excellent for parks, boardwalks, city walking, exercising, etc. It does take up a lot of space in the trunk, but we can live with that. The kids are very comfortable in the stroller. I am very happy with this stroller - and the parent console is a huge plus! My only recommendation is the shade extender to go with it - it does not shade the children from the sun very well...other than that, I highly recommend!"
4,VERY NICE STROLLER ... but,This is a really lovely stroller the only BUT I have is the canopy ! It's very frustrating for the babies with the sun in their eyes and there is really nothing you can do with this canopy to prevent this. They really need to put a more retractable one on it.... the front wheel wobbled just after a week but all you do is remove the front triangle shaped black part (the foot rest for the babies) and tighten a nut underneath and thankfully I havent had the problem since but the main problem is the canopy ! Did they not know this when making the stroller ?????? I would really like to hear what other people have to say. !
3,"Loving it, but it could use some improvements","I absolutely love that this stroller is on the lighter side and is SO easy to manuever. It'll stroll over anything in it's path and it's a very smooth ride. The seats seem comfy for my kids, ages 2&4. It's a manageable size for a side-by-side double. There are some things that could use improvements: the sunshield does not block out the sun at all, the baskets underneath are difficult to get things in and out and the seats are far too reclined, even in the most upright position. My kids have to either lie down or sit up, holding onto the bar (which should be a snack tray). The stroller could also use a hard parent tray to store some things in. Despite these things (which would make it perfect), I am enjoying it overall. I did buy this jogger for walking/running errands/trips to the mall, not jogging w/ my kids. I suppose if I were using it to jog, most of these issues would not be a problem."
4,Wonderful stroller,"This stroller is light and easy to push. It turns on a dime even when the front wheel is in the locked position. The seats recline easily and the hood has a clear pane in it so you can see your children when the hood is deployed. I like this stroller much better than my more expensive Zooper single stroller. Most importantly, my children like it, too! However, the lack of adequate sun screen as well as the difficulty getting things in and out of the basket underneath the stroller is why I didn't give it a 5-star rating."
4,Instep jogging stroller,I love my new jogging stroller! It's very easy to steer and push. I only wish the canopy would protect the kids more. Overall great product for the price.
1,THIS PACKAGE is missing WONDER BAR!!!!!,"This particular Warner Brothers package is missing the film with the most bigoted Al Jolson/Busby Berkeley number, EVER put to film: WONDER BAR!!! That film has to be purchased separately from Warner Bros, as they felt uncomfortable with a number at the end of the film called, ""Goin' To Heaven on a Mule"" where Al, in blackface, goes to a segregated black art-deco heaven. Stereotypes are SO thick in this number that they would take pages to describe...WONDER BAR is Hollywood bigotry at its finest...But then, there's ""West Side Story"""
5,"A hilarious, feel good read!","Pamela is an accomplished, single professional. Her grandmother, Nana, is a nut - or so everyone thinks, simply because Nana talks to spirits. And, these invisible people have definite plans for Pamela and her future...With delightfully quirky characters and a twisty, otherworldly plot, NANA is the feel good read of the year. I found myself laughing every other page!A story that restores your faith in love, life and the hereafter."
2,comforter,Way too heavy and stiff. They were not comfortable especially for children. It did not hang but just stuck out strait.
5,Great Quality Comforter,"I was very pleased with the quality of this comforter. I bought the King Size for my Queen Size bed because I like the extra to hang over, also my bed sits high. I saw this product several months ago but did not want pay the full price then. I purchased now at half the price. Great deal!! Shipping was very quick."
3,Limited edition interview picture disc,"The CD has 2 pics printed on the face of it. One is a pic of Dave Gahan singing holding the microphone in his classic style. The other pic is of the band(a very young looking band). The CD does not contain any music whatsoever. The CD is a compilation of interviews from ""A Broken Frame"" era. Although the interviews are insightful, there is a lot of background noise of automobiles and such. It is still worth the money for a limited edition CD."
2,gritty,"i was disappointed in this lotion. i'd hoped for a lovely emollient lotion and subtle sparkle, but it's cheap lotion with a ton of disco glitter in it."
2,Crisp prose but poor story,"Like the jungle slowly being covered in magnificent jewels within the novel, Ballard's dreamy prose and elegant writing style cover a rather banal and uninteresting story that never arrives anywhere. Casually tied to the bones of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, The Crystal World is clearly an early attempt at philosophical introspection by an author whose style would mature much later. The Crystal World's setting is indeed fascinating as a piece of speculative fiction, but not much was done with it except as a background for some thin romance and confused, meandering characters. As noted previously the colonial mindset will also grate on modern PC sensibilities."
4,Fantastic Historical details,"I've read the entire Sir John series and am a strong admirer. I think Alexander is highly talented in his abilities to bring to life the gritty, dirty,and often violent streets of old London. I find Sir John to be a terrific character - with the gift of ""seeing"" into the hearts of men better than most blessed with perfect vision."
3,"good moves, not very organized","David is a fine instructor but this DVD is difficult to follow. You are instructed to move the same direction David moves, while facing him; your movements are not mirrored. So, unless you are watching a segment with the performers' backs to you, you are struggling with direction as well as new movements."
5,"Best, Easy to Follow Begining Tai Chi Instuction","THE BEST I SEEN IN A EASY TO FOLLOW SHORT YANG STYLE TAI CHI FORM,BUT ONLY THE FIRST 24 POSITIONS. I RECCOMEND THIS FOR ANY BEGINNER BUT DO NOT TRY TO SAVE A COUPLE DOLLARS AND BUY USED, I DID AND THE ""AS NEW"" FROM DEALER WAS A BIT FUZZY. I HAVE SINCE REPURCHASED DISC NEW!"
5,DAYDREAMS FROM A WORKING STIFF,THE BOOK WAS VERY STIMULATING AND HARD TO PUT DOWN AFTER YOU GOT STARTED. THE SHORT STORIES WERE EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND KEPT MY ATTENTION AT ALL TIMES. EVERYONE SHOULD TRY READING THESE SHORT STORIES. I FEEL THE AUTHOR SHOULD EXPAND SOME OF THEM INTO NOVELS BECAUSE THE SHORT STORY LEFT YOU FEELING THAT THERE HAS TO BE MORE TO COME. PLEASE PASS THESE REMARKS ON TO THE AUTHOR SINCE SHE SHOULD BEGING WRITING A NOVEL ON SEVERAL OF THE STORIES.
2,Disappointing is an understatement,"I ended up with this book because it was matched up with another book, ""Kill Me If You Can"", a book that many battlefield hardened grunts had said was a really good book, and it was. This one leaves a lot to be desired if one is non-military and trying to learn what the war was like. I suspect that most of the really good reviews here came from the author's friends."
1,Twerp,"The book was written by a Twerp! He spends so much time telling how the Warrants and EM'swere inferior (in all ways) to him because he went to college. He spends more time ranting about how stupid some of his superior officers were. This is the type of officer who probably been fragged if he served in a ground unit,,,,So much BS I WANTED TO PUKE"
5,The public needs to know!,"A must read book. Bobby Garwood, traitor or hero?The debate continues but it appears to me that he simply beat his captors at their own game only to be called a ""collaborator"" when he finally made it home. I truly hope he is still appealing his case. Col. Tom McKenney, whose job was to organize ""killer teams"" to eliminate such ""traitors"", followed his orders as he was trained to and carried them out to the point of obsession. When Col. McKenney realized how, he too, had been used by the ""system"", he was almost destroyed. The government stands by it's policy for a ""full accounting"" of POW/MIAs from the Vietnam War but how can we trust those who have decieved for 20+ years the families of those left behind dead and, most certainly, alive!"
3,Not the Best,"Sadly, the Jake Grafton series has gone downhill since he gave up flying and switched to intelligence operations. Liberty relies too much on the same characters used in prior novels, which results in a storyline that is highly improbable."
3,"Measures blood pressure OK, easily forgets","As for the straight task of measuring blood pressure, it does a fine job, being in close agreement with results taken by a doctor, and it works with no fuss. However, I was dissatisfied with this product (ultimately returning it) because it too easily forgot its ""remembered"" old measurements. For me, ""How my blood pressure is doing over time"" is very important, and I cannot have the machine forgetting old measurements.It would forget if it is unplugged from AC for just a second, or if the batteries are removed. The manual recommends that the batteries NOT be used when using AC, so I guess the batteries cannot be used as a memory backup. In these days of gigabyte flash drives, there is no excuse for losing memory when losing power."
2,meh,was good while i had it....which was about 5 months. But the plastic was cheap and dented the first day I used it. I dont recommend this head to anyone though I did think it was a good head while it around.
5,This is the complete version,"This is the complete version, including the full Too drunk. Nouvelle Vague was successful in creating another facet of what was considered New Wave at the time. Still a fun listen."
1,No possible way to attach the shield to the base,"This light has a really retarded design: rather than regular ""screw on"", it has bizzare ""clip on"" shield. The clip included in the package does not fit into where it should fit in the base, and even when I ""glued"" it on, it does not clip and attach to the shield. I thought I got a flaw item so I called back and requested a new one, and guess what, it's the same thing. I really wish it would work since it's a nice looking light but it does not."
4,Great value,"Not a bad little promo dvd, the tracks are (however you cannot skip through its all 1 track)1.Intro/Ode To The Sun2.Interview3.Catch Without Arms4.Interview5.Advertisement For New Album Catch Without Arms6.Interview Introduction To Sang Real7.Sang Real8.Interview9.The Tanbark Is Hot Lava10.Interview11.Advertisement For New Album Catch Without Arms12.Interview Introduction To Bug Eyes13.Bug Eyes14.Interview15.Bug Eyes Video16.InterviewThe highlights obviously are the live songs, which are great if ripped from the DVD as audio. Also it contains the best songs off catch without arms. At usually less than $2 on amazon, how can you go wrong?"
1,product,I was so excited about purchasing this product because of a free sample I received at Bloomingdales. I loved it so much that I wanted to see if I can get it on line. I bought this product and received it promptly but the perfume itself was not the same as the original sample I got from Blommingdales! I was very dissapointed! It sorta smelled the same but not really -- it had a slightly different smell and it's not a pleasant one?? I now wonder if it's the original perfume? So my thought is I didn't get the real thing??? Is this a knock-off perfume? Because it definitely smelled like one! It smelled cheap and this is NOT a cheap perfume! Very unhappy about it!
4,Worked....Eventually,"We got this for our 6 year old to help him stop sucking his thumb. He was pretty resistant in changing at first. Just like anything else with parenting, you have to stick with it. Do expect to pick up the book and have magic happen. Ours came with a cloth glove, he would just take it off at night. So we would tape it up every night. It is eventually up to the child to want to stop. He eventually stoped sucking it."
3,Too Simple,"Perhaps by the time I got to this particular book, it was already a bit beneath me. Still, it seemed to me that the arguments presented were simplistic. For example, the ""discussion"" with Paul and law betrayed a distinct anti-legalistic bias, and did so in what totally ignored the finer (and not so fine) points of what is in reality a highly complex debate. Nevertheless, I suppose it would have some benefit for those starting out in the Biblical studies field, though my more liberal colleagues would probably disagree."
1,one star for effort,"This film is so egregiously historically inacurrate. They have taken the world's greatest Roman and convoluted his history, and his dignitas. I am disgusted with the screenwriters. However, Hollywood will be Hollywood. The will continue to screw things up so bad just for the sake of entertainment. They nearly forty years of history and cram it all into a mere ten. They made an effort to make it look like Rome, but far too many things were off. The true story of Gaius Julius Caesar's rise to power and his assasination will take SIX films, all of which, two and half to three hours a piece. This is truly a piece of crap. For starters, Gauis Julius Caesar was blonde. If you can't get that right, why even try?"
4,"Historically loose, but still quite entertaining.","I have read some earlier reviews that point out the many, many historical ""liberties"" that were taken in the production of this movie, and they're right. However, if you're not such a historical purist, if you're in it strictly for the entertainment value, I think you'll really enjoy this film. Personally I think the historical critics so far have been unduly harsh with what is otherwise a very admirable production.Jeremy Sisto was excellent as Caesar, and was very ably supported by Christopher Walken (Cato), Richard Harris (Sulla) and Chris Noth (Pompey). The depiction of the siege of Alesia was very well done, in my opinion. There were quite a few emotionally gripping scenes, not the least of which is the climactic assassination in the Senate. If you don't get too hung up on the history, I think you'll agree that this movie is three hours well spent."
3,OK for deer but the rabbits love it,"This product saved my rose garden from the deer. But, the rabbits love the pepper plants. I think they play catch with the peppers they knock off at night and they eat leaves every night. I gave up on green beans growing in the garden. They eat everything but the stems. I tried mixing it stronger and that didn't help. It is not that the rabbits can't find anything to eat. The peppers and beans are just what they want. They didn't bother the peppers until they had the beans all eaten off."
5,It really works,"We bought this to protect 150 newly planted trees. We weren't sure if this would work or not, so sprayed some trees and left others untreated. The deer left the treated trees alone entirely and continued to eat at the untreated trees. I also spray around parts of my vegetable garden where rabbits get thru the fence, and it seems to work pretty well there too.It does seem to have some residual effect, but you need to reapply every few weeks, especially when you first start using it. We use this often, and the concentrate is a much better value than the smaller bottles. It smells pretty bad, sort of a mix of vomit and garlic - if you're treating plants right next to your house, the smell might be an issue, but I really can't smell it once it dries."
3,Pros vs Cons and you are the judge,">Pros:*Helps you to explore new horizons*The structure of the book is excellent(some grammar, essay pattern, etc)>Cons:*The presentation of the material is very bad ( most modern books take advantage of icons, notes, colors and side remarks to improve the learnability of the material).*Essays are not written in a simple language.>Decision:Buy this book as a complementary material in addition to another GRE book if you have enough money."
1,For those who have written an essay before...,"For those who have written an essay before (think AP tests or SAT 2 writing or even a serious English/History paper), this book is a waste of time and money. I bought this book mainly so I could get free shipping on another book, and I wish I had just paid shipping. The essays presented here are terrible, and a similar essay would score in the 3-4 range on the GRE (out of a possible 6, and only 32% of test takers score below 4). Don't fool yourself into thinking that the essays are real or teach you anything. Save your effort and see the free downloadable files on the GRE website (gre.org) with REAL responses and criticism for each score level. Some people have said that the punctuation/grammar review is helpful, but unless you've been living in a box involving no reading of articles online or in other media, or perhaps have been speaking and writing in a language besides English, this is a waste of time."
5,Just Like The Real Thing,I got this book in advance of taking the GRE and it helped tremendously. The book centered on the essay portion and that's why I got it. It also mirrored the writing prompts exactly. As a result I was able to figure out how to answer the Issue and Argument sections prior to going in. For $11 or $12 the book was well worth the money spent-that is if you really do want to improve your writing score.Dr. Avants did a good job.
4,Cant't beat it for the price,"This works really well in that it is short and to the point, gives approaches, and it gives the background for a thorough review. After years out of school, I needed all the help I could get-and that's what I got."
4,"Useful Info, but not for small markets","This is a good book, that covers a lot of info. It also holds up as a book, and not just a how-to. All the info in this book is good info, but it is better suited for large markets. Don't expect to be able to read this book and be able run a business right of the gates, but at the same time this will help get you on the right track. Get this book, it is a good look into how someone got into the business and was able to make it work for a long time."
4,funny and cute.,I just love the characters and how the story is. My favorite character is Rurubell and stasia. And Julliana can really kick rear with that srowd. Lilith can summoun great powers. I love this tape and I love the 2nd tape too. They should put both tape on DVD.
1,Worst Cheat Piece of Garbage on the Market,"Unless you have legs like a chicken forget this product. I woke up two nights in a row in terrible pain in my calfs (I work out a little and my calfs are 18"") Just terrible. A cheaply made piece of garbage and their customer service is simply terrible. Pass on this one. Not even one star."
3,Not what I expected,"While there is a lot of good information in this book, it's not exactly what I expected. I already had the ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" and the ""What to Expect - the first year"" books, and everything covered in this book is covered in those, and a little easier to find in a hurry, in my opinion. I was hoping for something that would be a good quick reference for my husband (w're first-time parents), but it's not laid on in what I'd call a ""man-friendly"" manner -- meaning there's a lot of additional information, explanation, reasons, etc. wrapped around each topic, rather than getting quickly to the point. Not that any of that information is bad, it's just not really the quick and easy guide for sleep-deprived new parents that I'd hoped for."
3,Too Simplistic,"While this book did cover the basics, it did not go far beyond that. If you have every spent a couple of days with a newborn, you pretty much know most of what this book has to tell you. I was quite disappointed since it received such rave reviews. I think it would be most suited for first time parents who have never had any experience with babies."
4,"Practical, easy to read advice for all things baby.","This book was a great buy! I found the advice practical, easy to read, and not condescending in any way. The authors offered knowledgeable things to consider for various potential areas of baby care (e.g., bathing, feeding, finding daycare etc.) I definitely recommend to friends."
1,Heading home with newborn.,"This book had such great reviews, but I was really disappointed. Personally i dont like this book.I feel for little information they have written tooo many pages. Thats really annoying to spend lots of time.I won't suggest you to buy this book if u are first time parent expecting suggestions from what to buy to how baby will react and how to take care of baby at every stage.I will suggest "" What to Expect the First Year"". I felt this book more informative and interesting.Happy parenting.."
2,Not worth the price!,"Read the fine print! First off, this book only has 25 pages and is more a pamphlet/booklet than a book at all. The dimensions are small - this staple-bound pamphlet is smaller than your average day planner.Ok, so I think the saying goes something like ""it's not the size of the package, it's how you use it"", but when it comes to this book, they've not used what little space there is well at all. It is certainly not chock full of ideas and what die cut patterns are shown are nothing more than what you can buy at your local craft store for $1.00. They're your average, every day die cut designs - nothing to get crazy about and waste your $6.00 on.If you're a scrapbooker, you must have a little creativity in your blood. Think about it, there's probably something a lot better you can do with your hard earned $6.00, but don't spend it on this one!! There are plenty of other books out there on the subject that may be more expensive, but are worth their weight in gold."
4,fun,"Don't buy this for the pictures! This book is about information, not photos. But the presentation is fun. Its a bit personalized, but at the same time informative. You'll know what's moving around in the woods where you hike when your done, and you'll think of them as old friends. I like it, and hear myself quoting the guy every time some wild animal comes up: ""Did you know that....?"""
4,EnurAid Works,"When I am sick sometimes I get a personal problem when I have to sneeze or cough. This product doesn't take the problem totally away, but helps more than other things I have tried over-the counter. It doesn't have any interactions with anything I know of and is easy to use.I'm glad you have this available on the Amazon website since I don't see it in stores. Thanks!"
5,Easy to follow international relations text,"This book presents the concept of offense and defense dominance in the international system and how that makes war more or less likely. This dominance arises from the current technological and social situation of the great powers. The author explores how this has played out in Roman, medieval, and modern times.The book was written during the Cold War, so some of the conclusions are less valuable today. That being said, the book can be read for the concept which the reader can apply for him- or herself."
5,Twenty five years and counting,"I read Psychocybernetics twenty five years ago and feel that it has positively influenced my entire adult life. Having read thousands of books, this one stands out. Some of Maltz's ideas seem epiphanic if sometimes obvious. I Love to read and feel that one useful idea is plenty of ""paydirt"" for reading a well-written book. In this case, I thoroughly enjoyed reading from cover to cover and had countless ""ahaaaaa moments"". Without attempting to sell the specifics, my attestation is that I have been conversationaly refering to this book for twenty five years! For eight bucks its a pretty good deal. Take what you want and leave the rest."
4,Why not 5 stars?,"Surely, it is 5 star book as concerns the theme and the general story. It is very difficult to find a book in which the protagonists describe step by step the creation of the first macintosh. A must have book that every mac fan and generally computer lover must read. But, why not 5 stars? Beacause the story could be more narrative and more ""magical"""
2,Notice that this is mouse isn't optical,"When I bought this mouse, I didn't realize it was a regular mouse with a ball. I assumed it was optical. With a regular mouse, you need to get a mouse pad. And, even with a mouse pad, it'll still wear out.I only need this mouse until I buy a new computer later this year, so I guess it works out."
2,already broken,Has a crack in it through one of the screw holes. Not a well made product. Not a well made product.
1,DVD Lockup,"I bought this item and loved the TV part. Unfortunately, the DVD is very poor. Items like zoom and slow motion which are standard on even the cheapest of DVDs are missing from this product. Worst of all, the DVD player locked up after about 20 min when the pause was selected. The DVD continued to randomly lock up. The only cure was to unplug the unit for about 5min. The Magnavox customer service line had no suggestions or software updates."
2,"Very cool game, but super unstable even after patch","The Russians invented the superbly reliable AK-47, now if they could only do the same with software. This game is very promising even though the graphics leave something to be desired. It is alot of fun though when it doesn't crash every 10 minutes. The strategic lvl is a little tedious but still fun. The tactical lvl is very cool using and controlling ships. Allies expansion will make this even more fun since you will be able to control the big guns on ships, and have location based damage. I will be getting it and seeing if it is anymore stable. Also, I have passed along some patch ideas to Buka so I will update this when I hear back."
3,An OK book.,I agree with other reviews. There are too many untied ends in this book. Thw whol plot doesn't make any sense to me.
2,As Lame As They Come,"This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. This guy hasn't a clue. If you're going to write about someone, anyone at least know the facts. I looked up 3 guitarists, all of which had bogus information. My feeling is, 3 strikes and your out. Even when it came to Jeff Beck saying the reason he left the Yardbirds was due to a dispute with Jimmy Page, NOT!!! Beck was ousted for being a nutjob, which is what makes him one of the best guitarists ever. My opinion, avaoid this book at all costs, you'll learn nothing but one man's useless opinion which we all know the old adage about opinions. Opinions are like....., everybody's got one."
5,Another wonderful gift from a very creative woman,"I have long enjoyed the creativity of Miriam Therese Winter, both in terms of music (I have an extensive collection of her albums in the old 33-1/3 RPM format) and her writing. I have reviewed her memoir, ""The Singer and the Song"", previously. It is happenstance that I acquired WomanWord at the encouragement of a friend, who is the facilitator of a scripture study I'm currently attending. Since we are in fact using this book as part of the class, I am not ""done"" reading it, but what I have encountered to date is exceptionally rewarding. The scriptural explications and re-translations to reflect the female perspective are extraordinary, and the illustrations are powerful. The questions that accompany each section are very meaningful and thought-provoking. This is another book that I have no intention of allowing to leave my library, except perhaps on temporary loan, and which I know I will reference and use on many occasions."
3,GOOD VALUE,"If you are looking for a small inexpensive ipod dock holder this one fits the bill. I bought it for my 8 1/2 month olds room. It does the job. I do hear a bit of a hissing noise in the background, but for the purpose of it and at 33.00 bucks its fine."
2,Great if you like to look at pictures.,"This is a great CD if you like to see pictures of Pink Floyd, however, the the rest of the CD pretty much stinks. The interviews are very boring and if you buy this CD don't expect to learn anything new about Pink Floyd."
2,Light doesn't work,Although the pot heats up the light never ever comes on. Shipping was over $6.00 so to send it back and receive one that POSSIBLY works isn't really cost effective.
1,Worst thing ever purchased,"This pot worked one time then never worked again and the once it worked it never really did heat up. Take your 10.oo get in the car go for a ride, roll down the window and throw the 10.00 out the window before you purchase this pot. I was so looking forward to this pot. The second time I went to use it I got shocked. Had it for 2 days and trashed it on the second day."
5,Fabulous Decaf Green Tea,"I became hooked on this brand years ago. Now I find other brands too bitter and harsh. If you like subtle green tea flavor, this is the tea for you."
3,Mediocre,"Deep undercover in a brutal criminal organization, FBI agent Kevin Cole must use extreme methods to prove himself. Ordered by the mysterious crime boss, Ziggy, to track down stolen millions, Cole has to torture the mob's accountant. But as he starts turning the screws, the mind games begin. Now who's controlling who? Enter the ruthless world of organized crime, where you're only as good as your last lie.This movie is not bad, but not that good either. It's got a pretty thin story. The main focus on the film, other than brutal torture, is the fragile mental state of the FBI agent who is supposed to be protecting the innocent rather than torturing them. It's a sado masachistic film and it does leave an impression, not a very good one though. The only redeeming thing in this film is the twist at the end. It's not a movie that is worth owning, but I think it may be worth seeing once. That's a toss up though. You're not really missing anything here."
3,A story for those who like happy endings.,"A good story with likeable characters, believable internal conflicts, and a happy ending. It is for everyone who believes that every small town deserves a dedicated doctor, willing to be on call 24/7."
3,not sure yet,"The lawn was messed up before I started using the Green-UM extra, so therefore I do not know if it is working or not. I will have to get some more so I can see if this really works."
4,A remarkable history perhaps not yet learned,"In searching for some background on middle east history, I happened upon this work. The times were so much different than today, at least in the western world.This work does get a bit bogged down in Miss Bell's personal life, but does a decent job of relating her life and times to the happenings in the yet-to-be-established Iraq.For a first time study of the region, it's as good a read as any. I too, as others have mentioed, would have liked a bit more solid (meaty) history.Her approach, learning, through personal interaction, tribe histories and notables, is still very applicable (and perhaps missing) today."
1,Waste of time,"There are plenty of more interesting people to read about. No mention is made that during the time of Bell's travels through Turkey the Armenians were being wiped out by the Turks. I found her to be pretentious and a spoiled girl who turned to daddy every time she ran out of money and wanted to be back in her ""beloved"" desert. If she was so wonderful at politics, how come those areas of the world are still at war?"
5,a great woman,This book is a great read--helps to understand the tribal origins in the Middle East and presents an amazing woman.
3,Gertrude Bell's amazingly accomplished life deserves better.,"Gertrude Bell was astounding in her grasp of policies and protocol which allowed her entre into a world denied (even Arab) women. I found myself imagining that I'd read twenty pages, only to discover that I'd turned only three: the book is over-written and tedious. As other reviewers were, I was annoyed that thoughts and private meetings to which the author was not privy, were portrayed as factual accounts.I do think Ms. Wallach did a tremendous amount of research, but WHERE WERE HER EDITORS? I so hope another author will address Ms. Bell's life in the near future: it deserves better."
2,Not Enough Info,"I would also suggest Lonely Planet Brazil, as well as a music book, ""The Brazilian Sound"" (Temple University Press), which contains a huge glossary, maps and a lot of cultural history."
3,Bent But Works,After receiving the dvd rack I noticed that the package withing the Amazon box was damaged. I open and checked the rack. The wall mounts were bent bad. But since it was wire I simple bent it back and then installed it. It takes very little space and looks good. Also do not buy if you only plan to have it sit on the floor. It almost falls over.
3,It's OK.,I own 2 of these. If used vertically they are fine. On the horizontal one runs into some tipping problems.
1,Beware! This CD is a mistake and almost a fraud!,"This is the worst Caetano album that he have ever issued. Forget this and try ""Estrangeiro"" or ""Circulad"" if you want to know why Caetano is one of the best brazilian composers of all times."
5,Another bright moment,"Thank God for Caetano (and Gil). Both of them have managed to keep their music real, passionate and udderly engaging--they are still the leaders of Brasilian music after three decades. This CD is as good as any Caetano has made. And his voice can send shivers up my spine. This CD is definitely worth buying--Brasil-minded or not."
5,Great book for anyone!,"This book seems to focus on the advanced level high schoolstudents looking for prominent institutions, BUT you can alsoapply all the steps for any other colleges you wish to attend!I found it very helpful and it really got me searching for thebest college that will match me."
1,Pass on this one,Everything on this CD can be found in magazine interviews posted on one of the Rollins fan websites. Save your money.
1,Not a good earring,"The beads look cheap and are not in perfect round shape at all. I am very disappointed with this pair, but satisfied with other products from this seller."
4,West,Morris west was one of the best and this last one proves the point. This is his last book and he has proved himself yet again as the master of vatican suspense. Many of his books are superb and modelled after part fiction and part christian history.
1,Errors and omisions...probelsm with this book,"It seems that the auhors really cut corners in this Wow series book. As a loyal and long time owner of the PS Wow series, I was disappointed with this book. For one thing some of the action scripts do not work. Try the carved text as just one example. Second, the authors still have not yet deigned a book that is TRULY cross platform. If you are a Windows user, you will be dissapointed with this book. All efforts to resolve problems with the publisher have been futile."
1,Ditto Ditto,"This is like buying a new Elton John record. Same old tired act. I've owned the previous Wow books and everytime am hoping for new material and actual sample files on the CD to use for the book tutorials. I think they just put a new cover on it and sent it out of the printer's shop. I wonder what the big wait was for, since the publicatin date was pushed up so many times. It couldn't have been new material added."
3,Where's the ImageReady stuff?,"The biggest difference between 5.5 and both 4.0 and 5.0 is the addition of ImageReady 2.0 for web-related tasks, but the new features in ImageReady are barely touched upon. Come on! If you don't have the 4.0 Wow book (and what self-respecting PS user doesn't), then 5.5 is probably a good book for you, but it doesn't add any value to the earlier edition."
4,adding to the collection,I am collecting all of his video travel documentary series but this one and his Hemmingway disk are probably the least two I'd recommend. Still good but not as good as all the others.
1,"Historical Fact should be re-checked by the ""History Channel""","Like most History Channel documentaries, this one doesn't impress one bit. I felt like watching a cheap documentary with historical lies repeated over and over.Luckily, I didn't buy it. and I urge those who want to learn real historical facts about the sahara to avoid this DVD set."
3,"Worthwhile, though a bit pricey","This is a short program apparently done originally for History Channel Broadcast, though I don't recall seeing it there. The secondary disk with biographies doesn't add much if the Sahara is your prime interest, but the primary program has several short, relatively self-contained segments on relevant topics, including the climate changes that created the desert, Carthage, the camel, a bit about the Romans (mainly featuring some decent footage and interviews with local experts on the amphitheater at El Djem plus some footage of the desert fort at Tisavar), a good segment on the Ksours, a segment on the American attempt to intervene in Tripoli (Libya) in the early 1800s, and other stuff. Image quality is good, production values are good, and they have some nice reenactments of things like Tuareg caravan ambushes and the Roman destruction of Carthage. I wince slightly at the price, but the program is a good one."
3,Not worth the price,"I have rated this product a three because it is severely overpriced. It certainly does fit well, but in my opinion and experience not better than other brands. A lower priced Victoria's Secret Biofit bra will do the job equally well."
2,A no go.,"This bra is shaped oddly; it creates the pointy breast style of the 1950s. I did not like it at all. Also it is very significantly padded, and the top of the bra does not make for a smooth transition from bra to chest."
4,scanner cop's review,"This here is the 4th movie that has to do with scanners, people born with the abilities to read minds, telechenisis, and mind minipulation. In this movie is a boy who is a scanner that grows up to become a scanner cop. I won't spoil the rest, you must see it for yourself if your a fan of science fiction."
5,Postcolonial flashback,"Born in India in 1976, I heard this group in 2006 after graduating from an art school in the US, the way I could associate with these voices only confirms time-space-less-ness of good music at large!"
4,works just fine,"This is a good scale - small, but reliable. Made of plastic - battery cover falls out at times."
2,waste of money,"I loved the show since the first episode; so of course I bought the dvd, but little did i know that basically I could have just recorded the episodes that came on tv beacause its exactly the same as the one on the dvd!!! There is no censoring option...so what was the point of burning 30 dollars..."
4,Love this perfurme-Hard to find!,Love this perfume. Received as a gift from Auntie in Scotland. Hard to find in stores in the US. Macy's in my area just stopped selling it.Glad to have found it.
5,Scary stuff,"I have recently been rereading all of Dorothy Gilman's Mrs. Pollifax books (some for the first time in over a decade) and have just finished ""A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax,"" her fourth. I love all of the Pollifax books but, so far, this is by far the scariest! I have not found any other Pollifax book to be so full of terror and suspense. Quite often, it is difficult to determine just how she will get out of the many and varied scrapes in which she finds herself. Once again, an incredibly fun and quick read."
4,The new optimum nutrition bible,"Well written, but a number of errors throughout which mar the book and make you wonder at the accuracy of the whole."
1,Very poor quality toy that is largely unusable,"We just purchased this toy today and were very disappointed. Although it looks cute from the packaging, it is actually extremely flimsy. The swing that comes with the set is unusable; when you try to swing it back and forth, it knocks over the entire set-up. As for the teeter-tauter, you can put the kitty and the puppy in it, but you can't make it go up and down without the animals falling out! Total waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT - EVEN ON SALE!"
2,A mediocre mystery with a homophobic sleuth,"I found this to be a plodding and mediocre mystery, lacking in hilarity or great wit. Claire Malloy's comments exhibit an anti-gay or homophobic prejudice against ""Bruce"" (stereotypical name) the bartender"
3,Good techniques but TOO short,"This Ballet DVD is broken down into beginner, intermediate, and advanced. However, both the intermediate and the advanced are the exact same workout. In other words, the advanced portion is the exact recording of the intermediate, with a disclosure at the start saying to ""just kick higher"". I was so extremely disappointed because I was soooo hoping for more challenging ballet moves. Also, each segment is only 15 minutes long. So it's hard to get a full, challenging ballet workout with this disc, unless you're willing to play the same sequence of moves twice. Elise Gulan's Ballet Conditioning is a far more challenging and full length workout."
4,not just for married people,"I got this book as a wedding present, but I think its strength is not its effort to get the couple into the kitchen (my kitchen only fits one anyway!) but its fresh, modern yet basic recipes and gorgeous, full page color photos. You just have to try their lamb chops with mint sauce recipe and their carrot cake!"
1,Too complicated! I'm a beginning cook and...,"My mom bought The First and Forever Cookbook for us to start us off right, but the recipes are way to complicated for beginning cooks. The photos are beautiful - they look a lot like a Martha Stewart magazine - but out of the recipes we thought sounded like something we would like and could make in an evening after work took much too long. We weren't eating before 8:30 pm! I might give the holidays section a try later when I learn how to make the basics, but for now I'll keep it on the shelf."
4,This book's cookin'!,"Much like my favorite chicken recipe from ""Bride & Groom,"" this book is ""divine""! I have quite the collection of cookbooks, but none gets more use than this one. And, it's managed to do what no other has: gotten my husband to help out!We received this as a wedding present, but it's been a gift in more ways than one! It should be shared by EVERYONE, not just husbands and wives."
3,Looks great but not practical,"This is a nice decoration for a house. Unfortunately it is not a practical CD holder. Let me preface this by saying I alphbetize my CDs. Therefore, if I take one out they all fall down a notch or if you buy something new, you have to manually rearrange each section. I would suggest buying a cd holder that runs horizontally instead of vertically. But if you are not anal like myself, this CD holder looks cool and is a space saver. Also, pretty sturdy for the price."
5,New Age? Jazz? The best of both!,"You'll be listenting to a completely unusual combination of sounds - the vibes and mirimba, accompanied at spots by cello and one or two other instruments playing melodies (it's hard to describe them as songs) that make for truly enjoyable listing. The music will also serve well as background for those rmore intimate, elaxing moments. Buy it. You'll love it."
4,Pretty Good barbeque Grill,"I'm really comfortable with this item, I made a lot of barbeque ribs and it is really easy to clean. The material and size are aligned at this price.I'll recommend this to buy."
3,Cooks surprisingly well for an indoor grill,"I purchased this grill about a month ago because I had gotten tired of my George Foreman grill. First, this grill gets hot rather quickly (less than 10 minutes) and cooks meats thoroughly as long they are not too thick. Unfortunately it is not smokeless. I turned on the exhaust fan on my stove to get rid of the smoke, but that didn't help either. By the way, I had to place it on my stove because it is very large, and that was the only place it would fit in my kitchen. I also wish that it had come with a lid, but I improvised by using the lids to a couple of pots and pans. Also, be careful when you are emptying the part that holds the water. It can spill all over the place if you are not careful. So even though I was disappointed that it was not smokeless, I am still pretty content with how well it cooks."
5,Bella Grilling,"I have grilled my first pieces of chicken on the grill today. I sprayed non-stick spray on the grill, turned up the temp to the correct heat and grilled away. I am totally satisfied! It was smokeless and left just the kind of char marks I envisioned. The grill itself is lightweight Can't wait to try grilling other items. Totally recommend it."
4,Great indoor grill,I recently purchased the grill and have used several times now. One of the best things about it is that there is very little smoke and it is pretty easy to clean. The one thing that I don't like is you can't really control the temperature so you have to really keep an eye out while grilling.
5,Mr Richard DiNaso,"By far this is the best indoor BBQ Grill I have ever had. Prior to this I have had a Farberware, and another brand indoor grill named Maverick. Neither one can come close to the Sanyo. IT does all and more to my expectations, and it is virtually smokeless. The only smoke that I have seen so far is the vapor coming from the chicken or burgers. It does the burgers to perfection and the chicken is tender and moist. The person who complained about this grill smoking must of been smoking something himself. This is my second one as the first one my wife left it on the burner and melted the housing so I had to order another one. I only wish you can order parts for it individually so I would not have to order the whole grill. But it is still worth it!!"
2,Indoor grill very disappointing,Bought this grill for when weather outside does not allow outdoor grilling. Also rating on Amazon seemed to endorse this product. What I have found out is this grill takes FOREVER to warm up & even then cooks extremely slow. Bear this in mind if you decide to buy. I would not buy this product again.
1,Unrateable,"We never used it. As soon as I opened the package we realized it was much too large for a New York City apartment, so it went back into the box and to the post office."
4,Use this often,I use this very often. It is nice to cook burgers or other meet and not have it sit in the grease. Only downside is the cooking only occurs where the food touch the grill. It really isn't a problem but you might have to add a few more minutes to cooking time. Im very happy I bought this. I also bought this as a gift for 2 other people and they just love their grill.
5,"easy, healthy, and delicious","This indoor grill has been a great addition to my kitchen. It is a lot easier to plug this in and grill all types of food than warm up my stove and oven. It is big enough to put everything on it and doesn't make my kitchen so hot to work in. It saves energy, using a fraction of what the stove does. When I cook the fat drains out and down into the little tray, so my food is healthier. Also, the entire grill is very easy to clean.This grill is fantastic for my big family. I use it daily to make dinner just for us and it also comes in handy when we have a party. I definitely recommend it."
5,Great Product,"This electric indoor grill is an excellent product. It was shipped quickly and that night I was grilling inside my kitchen. The product is lightweight, easy to clean and is very large for an indoor grill. I highly recommend it and will be purchasing another one for my daughter."
3,sanyo indoor grill,"We returned it the next day. We tried to make chicken skewers and the meat never got cooked well. I must confess that my wife and I are novices at grilling and may have made the skewers badly, but my wife was just not satisfied with the time it took, and with the fact that our chicken never cooked thoroughly. Our problem with the grill may have been more from our own inexperience with grilling, but nonetheless, we ended up returning it, unsatisfied. We may just make the jump to a real outdoor grill at some point."
1,Indoor Grill,The size of the grill is as shown but the taste of the food is not what I expected. I was looking for an indoor grill that would give a little BBQ taste. You do get the grill lines but it taste as if it was in the broiler.
5,Soon to Buy,"After reading all these wonderful reviews i have decided to buy this product. I have wanted/needed a grill for about a year now and this type seems to fit all my needs. I like the fact that i can grill indoors or outdoors, the price is in my budget, it is dishwasher safe and i can grill whether it is raining or not. I really like the concept of this product and cant wait to buy one!! Wonder what i will grill first...hmmmm..."
2,Fair,"Slow to warm, burgers ok, chicken takes too long and starts to burn, cannot put BBQ sauce on the food you are grilling, creates smoke. Cannot determine the exact temperature setting, dial jumps from 300-425 no lines in between on the temp guage."
4,i love it,"i saw this grill at my friend house ,the food was great thats how idecided to get it ,i cheked many places it was expensive but with amazon.com it was the best price i love it and i use it almost every week my family love the kabab i cook they are happy and im happy"
3,Average Grill.,This grill is pretty good.Keep it by an open window or next to the stove for ventilation.It wasn't as sturdy as I had hoped and doesn't cook as evenly as I had hoped either. All in all its decent for the price and good for the days you don't wish to start up the barbecue.
5,Great Griller,"This grill is smokeless and I cooked steaks and salmon, In a matter of minutes I fed my family. The 200 sq. inch grill is fantastic and I cooked alot of stuff on it. Thanks Great idea."
4,"Great ""Barbecue"" for the Suburban Apartment","I purchased this item so that I can ""grill"" on my terrace to replace a gas grill that, as a tenant, I am no longer able to use. This item is the closest grill to actual barbecue. The meats and grilled veggies came out terrific and the clean-up wasn't too tedious. The unit is fairly large, but is very light weight (surprise), and can be stored easily. The cooking surface is ample(does six burgers and a couple of hot dogs at once). I'm so happy we haven't had to give up out summer meals outside!"
3,"very convenient, but very slow","i've read the reviews, & bought. tried it for first time, on burger & franks. smells are wonderful, very little mess, easy cleaning. But the time it takes to heat astonished me, considering the reivews i'd read before. it took way too long to heat already cooked franks. So, unfortunately its off to buy a bulky gas grill, becuase, there may be more mess, but at least there will be a barbQ!if u have time, this is gr8, & good value. if u're trying to emulate a barbq without the mess, go elsewhere."
5,Excellent indoor grill,"This indoor grill has lived up to every promise. Very easy cleanup, doesn't take up too much space. Definitely would buy again."
4,"Good. Not the real thing, but good","I actually got this for my wife for her birthday (along with some other, more blingy things) because she misses grilled food when the weather turns bad. We broke it out last night and I tested it with burgers. I agree with one previous reviewer that the cooking times are really long, but I'm assuming that the temperatures given are to avoid smoke and to avoid too much power draw. Anyway, it worked, the burgers cooked fine and it actually marked them fairly nicely. I miss the actual smoky, flame-cooked flavors, but a little more paprika should help with that. She likes it and it will definitely be used again. I followed the instructions to spray with Pam and the cleanup was easy and fast.One warning: Don't put too much water in the drip tray or it becomes challenging to empty without spilling."
5,Sanyo Electric Indoor Grill,I used to have an electric indoor grill several years ago and it worked great. I saw this one on-line and thought I'd give it a shot. We've cooked steaks on it several times now and the steaks have cooked beautifully. They tasted as good as on a gas or charcoal grill without all the fuss or the outdoors. This grill has a drip pan that you fill with water which makes cleanup a breeze. Love this grill!
5,(Non) Smokin' Grill,We live in an apartment which recently banned outdoor grills so I was desperate for an alternative and this just fit the bill. It does not smoke as long as you remember to put the water in the drip pan. It is well constructed and cleans very easily which is important to me. It sears the steaks perfectly. The one very tiny issue I have is that the temperature control is not very definitive. It indicates the lowest and the highest and not any in between. This does not bother me enough not to use it and the meals have been wonderful.
3,Too smokey for indoors,"Although I purchased this considering others remarks that it was great and not too smokey for indoor use, I regret the purchase. It is easy to operate but after one use, where it put out a lot of grease and smoke, I retired it to the land of unused appliances. I find cooking a steak in a pan on the stove much better and much less smokey and messy."
1,impossible to clean,Grill works fine but is impossible to clean. Gunk has built up from repeated spraying of oil and grilling meat. Sanyo advises using a regular sponge only -- good luck! -- but I made the mistake of using one of those teflon-safe scrubbies... it takes the finish off and still leaves a lot of gunk. Just got off the phone with Sanyo -- that was useless. I'd find a different product if I were you.
2,Not what I expected,"It works fine, but in the picture it appeared it was a grill above the heated coin underneath. That wasnt the case, it is just like a griddle/grill combo thing, just only the grill part. The plate gets heated up itself, not open like an outdoor grill...."
4,Great grill,"This grill does everything I need it to. It cooks well and cleans easily. The only thing is like other reviewers said there are no walls around the grill so flipping items requires 2 utensils, 1 to hold the item from slipping off the edge and another to flip it over. Other than that it's a great product."
5,Very pleased with Sanyo Grill,"I have used my new Sanyo grill just once, to grill some chicken breasts. It worked just great, and I plan to use it again often. Since my apartment complex doesn't allow the use of charcoal or gas grills, I used this electric grill on a table set up on my porch. I can grill outside whenever I want to now, and then take it back inside for cleaning and storage."
4,Indoor Grill,Previously used indoor grills created too much smoke to be used indoors. There is no smoke with the Sanyo grill.
3,"Nice Scope, poor Tripod.","Your looking at trhis scope because you want big apature with GOTO technology and your poor. I aquired this scope from a friend of mine (NIB). It was easy to put together and within an hour I had the finder scope aligned and was off! All in all the optics are great, Jupiters moons were visable and I counted 5 stripes.As for the Goto tripod I'd have to say PASS! They realy went cheap when designing the tripod to go with there computer. The little (tiny!) electric motor has trouble slewing between stars directly over head.Id recomend it for beginers that arent sure if Astronomy is going to be there thing yet. When your ready to upgrade, buy a Meade ETX-125EC w/AutoStar and you'll be the envy of all your friends."
2,Building concrete tanks,This book is mostly about building concrete water tanks. Out west. Very little info about maintaining water quaility - bacteria - etc. In western PA you can't build concrete water tanks because its too frigging cold here. The section on ponds reads like TV Guide. This is a book for western people with water issues.
2,Not helpful,"I've bought this book because I wanted to know how we could manage the overflow from our tank and store this overflow water in various ponds and the like. This book didn't help at all because it only refers to big projects and states that the contractor will know how to build the dam wall. I didn't find anything helpful for our situation.Furthermore it is written like a school book, kind of boring."
5,wow so much info,there is so much information in this book. I am still reading that book . it is really informative . thank you
3,Not as expected.,"I got this for my brother-in-law, and he and his son were not very impressed with it as they already knew a lot of the info."
1,Not at all what I thought it was,I was hoping for something a little more practical and this book is way beyond what I was expecting. A little technical for me and it was totally an impulse buy!!
1,Not so great,"I heard a Christmas CD playing in a store this Holiday season and when I asked what it was, they told me ""Christmas with the Rat Pack"". Unfortunately there are two different CD's with this title and I bought the wrong one. This one.The music is kind of muffled and not really crisp sounding.It kind of sounds like it was taken from old, worn-out analog tapes and transferred directly to CD without any kind of digital cleaning or enhancement.I wasn't impressed with the song selection. The quality makes it that much more of a disappointment.Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one."
5,The poetry blends with the music beautifully!,Joy Harjo's poetry comes to life through her music from the saxophone and clarinet and the wonderful blend of acoustic and electric rhythm of the guitars and drums. Poetic Justice plays jazz and raggae to Joy's wonderful poems rendered through her voice.An excellent portrayal of poetry and music in one CD.
2,Not too much information in this book,"The book contains a list of 700 cards in the game. In fact, the game has much more cards than that. It misses a lot of important monsters such as blue eye white dragon and blue eye ultimate dragon. I doube how useful it is. Second, the book does not give you more information than the game instruction. It does not advise you how to beat each duelist or what kind of cards they have. It does not tell you how to play Yu-gi-oh card name. It does not tell you any hint/cheat/trick. The only value for this book is a list of 700 cards and nothing else. Well, I can get such information from other books. Not worth the money."
4,Long delivery,"The product was every one bit as advertised, however, it did not arrive before Christmas as it was intended. That is the only complaint I have for this product, other than that my son loves it."
1,The Blop That Wasn't There!,"I have little good to say! I was shipped a blank DVD. I shipped it back at an additional cost! I was only credited with the cost of the movie! In addition, the jacket and DVD were home quality - questionable source!!You have to watch these new Marketplace sellers! It's not the first time I was disappointed. I would have given them no stars, if possible."
4,Cult Classic Blob,"I first saw this movie as a 10 year old on TV. This was before cable when local channels had after-school movies, mostly horror movies from the 1950s. ""The Blob"" really scared me as a kid. Its a great classic 50s sci-fi film. It doesn't scare me anymore, but its still fun to watch.Steve McQueen made this movie before he was a star. He needed the work and money. I have read and heard that Steve McQueen was offered either a flat fee or a percentage of the box office. He took the fee because he thought the movie was a clinker and he and his wife thought no one would see it. ""The Blob"" became a huge hit and a cult classic that made millions. McQueen regretted not getting a piece of the movie and fumed about it the rest of his life."
4,"""THE BLOB"" OOZES 1950's SENSIBILITIES","""The Blob"" on DVD by Criterion is a real treat. The print is exquisite, much better than the prints I'd seen on the ""4:30 Movie"" in the 1970's. I always loved the scene in which the Blob creeps up on the mechanic under the car. (""HEY YOU- WATCH OUT!!"")Metaphorically and culturally, I believe ""The Blob"" is about the overall paranoia in the 1950's; aliens, communists and teenagers had to be stopped, or at least controlled! ""The Blob"" itself is a mass of goop, indicating the ambiguous nature of our enemies. By the end of the 1950's, we didn't know who we were afraid of, but we sure were afraid!!!""The Blob"" can also be appreciated as the carnivorous nature of 1950's consumerism which was hitting its post-war peak in the film. The DVD liner notes extrapolate on this theme in greater detail.This movie is a low-budget treat for all time!"
5,The classic horror movie,"Thank you god for this masterpiece of a movie. It is so cheesy, it is so, funny, it is so FAKE. I luv everything about this movie. Hellen crump from Mayberry looks a little younger but not much. Her being in this and Bad Ronald is about all she ever did outside the county lines of Mayberry. Besides her terrible acting there is also this annoying little brother. Who's brother could it be you ask? Only Hellen Dump's. I mean Crump. Steve McQueen is awesome and I luv a cheesy horror flick. Also pay attention to the movie theater scene. When they're running out of the theater pay close attention to some of the victims reactions. You may just catch a smile or two. And don't forget, BEWARE OF THE BLOB!!!!"
3,"Classic movie, although not a great one","Original classic horror film that I remember liking when I was kid. Doesn't hold up that great, but it's not too bad either. The funniest part is Steve McQueen supposedly playing a teenager, but he's 29 at the time and looks even older."
1,How could they do this to a classic?,"I absolutely love the old sci-fi/horror classics. ""The Blob"" is one of my favorites. I purchased this DVD thinking I could replace my old VHS version of The Blob , however after viewing it only once ,... I think I will stick with my VHS version. The quality of picture is very poor, very noticeable flaws and stratches. The color is HORRIBLE. There isn't even a title menu on this DVD. Don't waste your money on this -- your best bet is to spend a little more money and buy the Criterion Collection edition."
3,Not what I expected,"This interview is from 1982 and nothing is current. When playing it on a regular stereo you can't even hear the questions that Bryan is being asked. Though if you are a true BA fan you will enjoy this trip to the past. For the casual listener, skip it."
5,Fun and Encouraging,"Lisa Johnson has managed to make this book a fun read while encouraging moms who are in ""the trenches"". Her stories are ones all moms can relate to, appreciate, and laugh over! No one else understands moms like other moms do - All moms will relish that feeling of being understood; Johnson shows us she possesss that great understanding through all her hilarious experiences. At the end of the book I felt disappointed there were no more stories! I look forward to a sequel."
1,Do not waste your $$$ or time.,"I ordered this thinking it was nice for the price. It arrived in a beat-up box, but my neighbor and I put it together. The tires turned out to be flat, the rims bent and several other problems. Because the box was damaged already, I had to beg for a bike box to return it. I'm still trying to find someone to help me take it apart so I can send it back. Then in 3 - 4 weeks' time, I'll finally get my money back after all that aggravation. I've been an Amazon customer for YEARS and have never had any complaint. I'm surprised Amazon would carry such a shoddy product. Don't buy it!!!"
2,"OK cheap Bike, but buy the Schwinn Hollywood","This bike is OK for a cheap bike, but about half as comfortable and well-made as the Schwinn Hollywood, which is a mere $30 more from Fogdog through amazon with free shipping. Compared to the Schwinn, this bike feels cheap and is not very comfortable. I bought a Scwhinn cruiser at the same time and whenever I'm not riding it, everyone wants to ride it and leave the Huffy in the garage. Get the picture? Get the Scwinn."
3,Strong in every area except originality,"This book has good style, a well-organized plot, a solid cast of characters and keeps your attention from start to finish. However, Brooks borrows entirely too much from his predecessors in the fantasy genre. One gets the sense that Brooks has taken ideas that he liked from authors who influenced him (Tolkien, MacDonald, LeGuin, etc.) and combined them all into this story. This is a light, entertaining read--just good enough to make me want to read more of Brooks but not good enough to catapult me into total fandom. If you like fantasy, you will probably like this book so don't hesitate to give it a try."
5,Great Pace! Great read!!,"I don't understand people negative reviews on this book especially those who have read most of Brook's material?? This book has three druids with great stories to each of them. They seperate early in the book and each story with them is fast pace and thrilling! I believe the fall of Paranor was well done, even the teh secondary characters in this book were well thought out. If you don't like this book then your just not a die hard fan of the Shannara series. If anything could of been different a trilogy would of been nice each book go further into each druid, lets face it we don't get much druid time throughout the other series so it is nice to have three to work with!"
2,The weakest in an otherwise decent series,"It seems to be the habit of most fantasy writers (or perhaps their publishers) to forever stick with the characters and worlds that made them famous; this pattern can be witnessed over and over again in the fantasy genre (see R.A. Salvatore, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, et al). The result, unfortunately, is usually books like this. One gets the feeling that even Brooks has grown tired of the series. The plot is nothing any faithful reader of Brooks isn't familiar with by now, and the literary execution is, to say the least, uninspired. Sadly, however, I'm sure that as I write this, Terry's publishing company is pressuring him to come up with yet another Shannarra novel, perhaps this time an epilogue to the series. What a waste of talent."
3,First King of Shannarra,I don't like the way that Terry Brooks does not bring a story to its conclusion within a single book.
2,A big disappointment,"I must say that I found this book a real disappointment, given the standard of the rest of the series.The plotting is thin, the action weak and the characters predictable. It reads like it was written using a fantasy-by-numbers manual and the cliché meter turned to the `on' position. Chunks of it are dull and full of padding.It is only worth reading for completeness and, to be frank, even then it doesn't add anything really significant to the canon.If it was a book other than in the Shannara series then I would only have given it one star.steve"
4,Singer DF150,"Great product! I especially love the adjustable feature. Makes sewing projects less hard. It has a height adjustment as well and you can use the hem marker for shirts, dresses, etc. A must have!"
4,Great,"The dress form is nice. It's a pretty color; it adjusts easily with easy to read sizes so there's no guess work. The material it's covered in causes fabrics to stick to it, this can be both a good and bad thing, but it can easily be fixed by covering the dress form.One issue I do have with it was the bar that slides up for height does not stay up all the time. I had it slip on me as I moved the dress form a few times. But it only ever slipped when I physically moved the dress form. Over all it's really good for the price and it arrived AMASINGLY fast! It was better then the inaccurate tilt-a-form I was using before."
2,Dress form,I was not aware that when I adjust the dial for a diff size range that there would be a steep gap in any case probably best for fitting I was purchasing for draping actually so I returned.
3,quality not as expected,"I have always wanted a dress form, so when I found this one I was so excited. The color (red) fit in my color scheme since it was to be used in guest bedroom. But when adjusting to fit my measurements, I started running into problems,(before ordering I checked my measurements so I would order the correct size). Does not hold settings on height, the hemmer marker slips so bad that I ruined 2 dresses, finally I taped the pieces in place where I could. As for the hip and bust barely open enough to fit I have some foam sheets that I have used to help make thaem work. Would I purchase this again, most likely not."
4,Covers a lot of models,"Has the information I need to fix my lady's car. This one covers quite a few different models, so sometimes there is a lot of skimming to find the instructions that are for the specific vehicle you are looking for, but I'd rather have too much info than too little, so that isn't much of a problem for me."
4,book is the best!,"I am surprised how much I liked this deck! I am not a fan of the collage art for the cards, I do not intuitively connect with them at all, but I do love the book, its explanations and spreads. The cards are the perfect size, shape and material for my hands so shuffling is easy, and I like how it fits all together in the box. I do recommend this deck to everyone, if just for the book alone!"
1,GO VIDEO went Out Of Business about 3 years ago ! BUYER BEWARE!,"Please don't waste your money. Even with an extended warranty, you will not be able to get it fixed (no replacement parts available) .Just get a brand that is ""still"" in business."
4,Up the ante,I am ready to improve my bread making skills and this book gives me enough technical info to give my cooking skills a boost. Maybe too I visited France and have not forgotten the flavour of really delectable bread. First Kindle cookbook for me but it looks workable and it takes up no physical space
3,great reference book,"I have a pantry full of flours yet I still did not have what many recipes called for. This was disappointing to me. I however, know that I will learn alot from this book."
5,If you love to bake then you knead this book,"If you are out there searching for a bread book like i was, take my advice and buy this book. It is a well written collection of Peter Reinhart's recipes, but also of his experiences. As you read this book you will find that you feel as though you are sitting in one of his classes at JWU. These recipes are clear and concise and the steps that lead up to it allow you to produce exactly what he says you will. Also checkout the back of this book to see other great books that he recommends. I must go purchase a second copy for a friend, happy baking!"
4,"If you want to learn about bread, this is the book to read","After many many failed attempts at just plain wheat bread, I broke down and bought this book. This book helped me understand the process of making bread, and I find that baking bread is much easier now.The only reason I gave it four stars, is because most of the recipes call for dough that's prepared a day in advance, and frankly, I just don't have time for that. While that may help the bread taste better, sometimes I just want plain wheat bread, and don't have two days to make it.Otherwise it's a very informative book."
5,Bread baking education,"Call it Bread Baking 101. Reinhart's classroom like approach is indeed a reminder to school days and I resigned myself to the approach to fully understand (if that's at all possible) the fundamentals of bread. The science behind the process is dry, but necessary in understanding how the dough is transforming in each step.Bottom line? I loved the book. I made my first batch of baguettes the other week and they came out fine. I frequently referred back to the early chapters checking my progress along the way. It's my second attempt at bread baking - I tried 20 years ago to disappointing results. The difference - certainly more practical experience at cooking in general, far better kitchen gadgets, but I'd say my new education from The Bread Baker's Apprentice is the biggest change!"
2,Hoity Doity,"If you believe everything you are told, this book is perfect for you. It is obviously printed to promote certain ingredients. You fall for it, buy them, and suppossedly you will be eating the best bread. Plain baking non pretentious books abound and they are not sponsored by companies which want you to buy their products."
4,"Great book for beginners, only one minor complaint","This is a great book, particularly for a person, such as myself, who's new to bread baking. Not only are the recipes great, with clear instructions that are easy to follow, Reinhart's writing is quite engaging. Another thing I like about this book is that the instructions are specified whether you're kneading by machine or by hand. For someone who doesn't have a mechanical mixer and doesn't plan on getting one, this is particularly helpful.My only complaint about this book is that the measurements are given in only the US system, not metric. Since I live in New Zealand, which uses the metric system, this is an inconvenience. A word of advice if you use the metric system, when making a recipe write down the converted recipe first, before you attempt it. I almost screwed up my first attempt because I tried to keep it all in my head. I believe Reinhart addresses this problem in his later books."
5,Nasty Cracker Pizza to Awesome Pizza!,"I read posts from people here on Amazon and many of the bread blogs most of which sung the praises for the author and this book. I had been working on making bread and pizza since Christmas 07 without much luck. I would get the occassional good bread/pizza but I had no consistency and the results were always dull. I got this book for Christmas 08 and it's Jan 3rd. I've already made 4 pizzas that way out classed my previous attempts all thanks to the author's techniques and the new found understanding of fermenting vs levening (rising) that this book talks about. My wife HATES the book because she just wants to follow recipies. I love it because he goes into the why in great detail, not just the how.You won't be sorry with this book."
5,Bread Bible,A wonderful step-by-step bread making book. My husband has made some wonderful creations and is loving this find. We even bought this book for a friend who was interested in learning the art of baking bread.
5,good reading and great bread,"I loved this book. I have read most of the first part but,not before I started trying the formulas. I've made bagles, brioche, and pain a l'ancienne. All of them great. while it does take an extra day to ferment most of the formulas it's not a problem. Just mix it and put it in the fridge. A good book book for people who want to take there bread making to the next level."
5,Surpassed all my expectations!,"I purchased this book based on previous Amazon reviews and was expecting it to be good - but I didn't expect it to take over my life and my kitchen! I have bowls of sour dough seed starters, barms and pate fermente. I'm stretching my dough to see if it passes the ""window pane"" test and sticking my milk frothing thermometer into the risen dough to see if it is warm enough - there is so much to learn in this book and it is so much FUN!!! You can use a machine mixer if you like - the author is encouraging of a variety of methods of kneading and proofing - and so far I have had great results - the instructions are very detailed and easy to follow.My only criticism is that I would want a few more pictures of the dough in its different stages particularly for the more complex recipes involving several different stages of wild yeast starter. I had no visual reference to see if my starter looked right on the final day. But a small point in an otherwise magnificent book!"
3,Book,Not what I expected the book has a lot to offer but they should explain some of the wording. Amy
2,Good cookbook...but,The printing of this book is totally lousy. The spine weakened within just a few weeks. This is my main complaint because I just don't think it will hold up to years of opening and closing. I can see this as coming apart.
5,Culinary masterpiece,"Making bread as an art form. Not only are the recipes extraordinary for any level of bread enthusiast, the history and personal stories of the chefs are a fascinating read. My brother ordered this for our mother now I must have one as well!"
5,For those who wonder when this was done...,"This interview takes place either during or shortly after the recording of ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"", so the release date for this is a little misleading since it had been a few years prior when the album had been made. It is just Anthony & Flea being interviewed, and is very entertaining because of the jokes they pull off on the interviewer when he is trying to be professional. If you want to know more about the recording process they go through, I highly recommend this disc."
3,They sent the wrong keys!,"Nice case and it fits my guitar well, but they sent me keys that do not fit the lock, making the case unlockable. This is disappointing as I am flying with the case."
4,Uusitalo - Tulenkantaja,"Like a vocal-less Luomo, Uusitalo's TULENKANTAJA has a cool and icy house groove, with some smatterings of electro-flourish for decoration. The beats kick in immediately with ""Paskaa Musaa,"" which has less glitch than one would ordinarily expect from Vladislav Delay, but enough to establish parentage. ""Odottava Peto"" goes more uptempo but still with a subdued feeling overall; this is not an album necessarily destined for the dancefloor. The bottom-heavy ""Kalajuttuja"" has an appealing reggae counter-beat at its start that adds some considerable bounce, while ""Nokkonen Päiväunilla"" is probably more messy than it needs to be. ""Uutta Verta Hangella"" gets things back on track, however, and the title track dubs things out even more. ""Misut Irti/Huutaa"" adds a nice deep and melodic touch, and ""Lasi Hajoaa"" ends the album on a deeper note. Nicely done overall."
2,"You could save time, money, and aggrivation if you...","There is no doubt that Marty is one of the most renowned experts in the world of HPUX...so for me, this book was VERY disappointing considering it's price. If you want all the information in this book plus more information, then buy the HPUX System Administration Handbook & Toolkit also by Marty P. You'll get nearly 300 more pages of text (which covers almost all of what is in the ""How to"" book) plus free software and other goodies. I bought both the handbook & toolkit as well as the ""how to"" book. If I had it to do over again, I would have just bought the Handbook and Toolkit."
2,Thin and short on detail,"This book is well written for an introductory book on HP-UX 10.x, but in no way is it close to being a 'How - To' book. It would be more appropriately called 'A Broad Overview.'"
4,"Good, but some things not updated to 10.X from 9.X","I deal with UNIX daily, from AIX to HPUX to IRIX. Each UNIX flavor is different, and having a book specifically focused on your UNIX platform is helpful. Using O'Reilly's UNIX In A Nutshell is good, but you'll get more out of this book."
4,Price reasonable and son loved it,"The 'outfit' was a bit cheap looking to me, but my son loved it. I got one for my older son too. He was pleased. They like the helmet (as they don't play school football) as a fun novelty. The jerseys are cute, but not ""official"" looking. Overall, not a bad 'toy' for the price."
3,"ProFlex 810 Utility Plus Glove, Black, Medium",Size was good but the finger tips started tearing after less than a month of light use and a couple of washes !
4,Interesting to rush fans from gpelais@yahoo.com,"From the picture I though this interview was from the late 70's, early 80's, but it is actually recorded in 1994. Sound quality is good, but you expect more for $12.00. I have better interviews that I traded for free, but I enjoy Rush interviews so much I purchase Story of Kings(vol1) and Vol2 as well. If you have an Rush interview to trade, drop me an email."
3,They are OK....BUT go with weathertech if you want quality,"Ordered them thinking I was saving money buying these rather then going to weather tech, but after putting in the ""custom"" fitted floor liners I realized the difference. They aren't properly sized to give that nice tailored fit.They are good quality material, and maybe my form was just bad. BUT for the extra $40 its worth getting the nicer ones especially if you get snow/dirt."
5,Romantic and spiritual review of the story of Compiègne nuns,Probably the best book never created about the Compiègne nuns. Far above from the Bernanos interpretation.
3,old fashioned story telling,"I read this novel for background for listening to Poulenc's opera Dialogues of the Carmelites. In comparison to the strong emotional impact of the opera, the novel is fairly dry, especially since it is told with some formality and stilted language. Hardly for the casual reader looking for a simple pasttime."
5,Stedman's Medical Dictionary,Excellent reference material. Received in a timely manner and in excellent conditon. Thank you again!
1,The alphabet indicator tabs did not match the pages,"The alphabet indicator tabs (""ABC"", ""DEF"", ""GHI"") did not match the pages in the Stedman Medical dictionary; and upon receiving 3 replacements, the mistake was duplicated and ""triplicated"" (but with different page problems) with each book that I received as a replacement and thus my frustration mounted with each dictionary I received. This is poor quality control and it was a very frustrating experience. On top of this, Amazon said that they would ""do something"" because of the 3 books that I received that were wrong and how I was inconvenienced and how they understood how upset I got. To date, nothing has been done. I was told by Amazon to buy the book elsewhere, which I just did -from the publisher. I am still waiting for Amazon to ""do something"" to make me feel like my 10++ years as a bona fide member of Amazon was worth something to them. I think they might have gotten too big!"
1,Big Mistake,"We had the TV about 3 months before the pic just screwed up...you couldn't watch it at all. Trying to get it fixed was the worst! You can't just take it back; they find a certified TV repair person in your city (which took a month), the repair people called and made an appt for 1 1/2 weeks out. They finally come find the problem, order the part (took 2 weeks) , make another appt(one week later) and come replace the bad part. Worked fine for another 2 months but has started the whole process all over again. When it works, great picture. All in all, we lost about 2 months of viewing waiting on for the run-around to come full circle!"
2,reasonable,"It took a software update to make this tv perform correctly. previously, the only time i was happy with the picture quality was for a fraction of a second when switching between the menu and normal viewing. for some reason, just exactly then, the picture became GREAT.fiddling with brightness and tint and contrast, etc, only generates slight changes in screen appearance.we touched the screen with bare fingers when we installed it, and seem to be cursed with an eternal unerasable smudge.seriously: no proctective, cleanable barrier between the lcd and the world?we have yet to get any hdtv equipment. no telling how things might improve"
4,A big step ahead for Ms. Womack,"Leanne Womack has always had a wonderful country voice, but I've thought that her material didn't always fit her skills. With this album, she has definitely moved up a notch thanks to good songwriting and song selection.There are a couple of standout tracks, specifically the title track and, ""I May Hate Myself in the Morning,"" a fantastic piece of country that doesn't sound much like current country radio. The album has a couple of dull tracks, but is for the most part consistently excellent.One thing I'd like to see is Womack writing more of her songs. I know she cowriters one or two of the tracks on this album, but I'd really like to hear more of her own ""voice"" in her work. But as far as singing someone else's words, she does it very well this time around."
5,We oughta know by now,"that this is what country should be.Story songs, timeless and evocative.I certainly hope There IS more where this came from.One's a couple, I may hate myself in the morning, 20 years and twohusbands ago--these are songs for the ages.Been there done that, you are singing my life.One listen and you will hear why Lee Ann won 3 CMAsfor this effort."
1,Not what I expected,"Ok, I never bought another prop wrench before but needed one to take my prop off. I ordered the wrench and it came just a few days later.Unfortunately it is made out of pretty weak plastic and the drain plug side tore upon first try. I did manage to loosen and tighten the prop but have no confidence that it will hold up over time.I guess I will start looking for a metal version of this wrench."
5,A Great Snorkelers Guide,"This book is wonderful. It has beautiful, clear photos and lots of useful information. We are enjoying using it to prepare for a vacation to Kauai."
4,Great Photos,"The author did an outstanding job compiling the many varieties of reef animals present on Hawaii's reefs and including them in one book. This book has it all if you want to get familar with what you'll most likely run into while diving or snorkeling while in the islands, but one drawback is the author's lack of detail in listing and describing the sites in the first part of the book where you're most likely to see such animals. I specifically wanted to know where to find them and at what depths. Using this book and a good dive or snorkeling guide like the O`ahu Snorkelers and Shore Divers Guide by Francisco B. de Carvalho would make anyone's hunt for photographic opportunities a simple task."
5,makes life easier,this was a gift for my daughter. She seemed to like the color choice and commented that this will make it alot easier to make custome-made costumes for belly-dancing.
2,Dressform,"I was very dissapointed with this product. When you enlarge the dressform it creates gaps so that when you fit a pattern or muslin to the form there is no place for the pins to attach. I was very pleased with the order process. I received my product expediently and with no damage. Thank you, Andrea"
4,Does what it's designed to do.,"Okay, really, it's just designed to stand there! :) Measurements adjusted pretty easily, worked well. I liked that I could pin to the form. As other reviews said, does seem a little flimsy but I guess that's to be expected with the price. All-in-all, I'd say for the non-professional sewer, this is a good product."
2,"Spindly, damaged, not true to size","Singer's quality is not what is used to be. This dress form is too weak and spindly to be of much good for anyone. I am a size 10 but had to order the size Large form which if memory serves me, states it is for sizes 16-22 so these forms are not true to size. This form was damaged upon arrival and was returned. Pay more and get something sturdier."
2,wrong size and no service,"I ordered an adjustable dress form, size medium, for my daughter as a birthday present. When it arrived it was a size large. I emailed the company who emailed us a postal seal to return the item. On the return information and via email we indicated that they had sent a large instead of a medium and after seeing the size of the large we would prefer a medium or small. Weeks went by with no information. Today I got my credit card bill and saw that rather than send us the right item they just credited back to my credit card. If they had bothered to tell me sooner I would have ordered another dress form in the correct size from a differnt vender. This was a birthday present to my daughter who really needed it for her work, so I was disappointed that they didn't keep us informed."
3,Be careful,"Overall this is a good splitter, however, be VERY careful with the mounting pins. They are plastic and cheap. When my splitter arrived one of the plastic mounting pins were already broke. I broke one on the telephone distribution panel too. If you are going to use Leviton Structured Media Enclosures and the components that go in them, order an extra package of mounting pins because you WILL break at least one of them while installing/building your system. Overall I am very pleased with all the Leviton products that I have purchased and used, however, they fell short with the design of their pin mounting system."
1,I'm on the edge of my chair...,"I have heard there were going to be two more episodes to really wrap up the show. I think the show has suffered enormously this season by dissembling Brenda from the death of Terrel Baylor. There was not ""shot caller."" It went down because Brenda made it happen.It has also suffered because in an effort to build a spin-off with the remaining characters, each show features one of them & it's just so awkward & obvious, the integrity of the script is gone. I love these characters but without Brenda, they can't hold up the show. If ""Raydor"" takes over Brenda's position it still won't help.I love this show. I have every episode on tape & all of Season Seven from Amazon. But it needs to go away & it needs a proper burial. I'd love to see Brenda get pregnant at her age & for her & Fritz to leave the show.One season. That's my prediction. Without Kyra Sedgwick, the show can go one bad season.9*"
3,dissapointed,this was more formular than others. less humor also. only a couple of episodes were fun. we're sorry to see the series end.
4,The Closer - end of season.,"I have them all now. Loved this series very much but was let down a bit with the writing at the end. However it was worth the money to buy all 7 seasons. This show is good watching, over and over again. Also I love the humour."
5,Awesome,I can't believe this is the final episode of such a great show. Sorry to see it end. Did they leave it open for Brenda to be a guest star on the new spin off show?
5,CLOSER,BEST SERIES. I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE THE SERIES AT MY FINGERTIPS. The characters seem like family. I watch it often.
4,Canon Digital Elph Accessory Kit (Leather Case and Rechargeable battery),These are great products and I enjoy them a lot. The case fits the SD550 perfectly. It also came with a leather wrist strap. The rechargeable battery is original and takes within 30 minutes to fully charge. Great products.
3,"Decent Knowledge, but not that great.","This is basically a cd on what it says: an interview. The band just goes through their thoughts and actions in the making of their first three albums: ""Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid"", ""Collective Soul"", and ""Disciplined Breakdown."" It is a good cd if you are a fan of the band and want to know the feelings and emotions that go into their songs, but if you just like the music for the sound, I wouldn't recommend this for you. I enjoyed it, but most people should probably shy away from it for now."
3,"Good Book, needs formatting","The book, as is all Dumas works, is excellent. It needs some minor formatting fixes, like the Italics command shows up out of no where every once in a while and 10 to 15 pages are all in Italics, then it goes away. Any good editor could fix this in a day or so. Other than that, this is a excellent book. It gets a three star only because of formatting, the book itself is excellent."
4,Hailstock does it again!!,"Another great book by Hailstock! I do not know about Aurora, but I do not think having someone out there in the world that looks like me is anything to smile about! This story was very entertaining, to me anyway! Good Read!"
5,Brilliant and Moving,"I passed up this movie several times at the video store. Something about the generic title and Patrick Swayze's big mug gracing the cover. I had no idea what I was missing. ""Green Dragon"" brings to light a piece of lost history--the internment camps of Vietnamese refugees following the Vietnam war. Through the film we meet a variety of characters and their developing relationships with one another. 3 things really make this picture work: the wonderful perfomances, the stunning photography, and the direction from the Bui brothers. Tony and Timothy Bui previously made another wonderful picture called ""Three Seasons."" ""Green Dragon"" is as good, if not better. They love these characters, and that's what makes the movie so fulfilling. Extra features on the DVD include an audio commentary, Documentary, 3 trailers (Crouching Tiger, Beijing Bicycle, and Vertical Ray of the Sun), and an essay on the cinematography. If not to own, ""Green Dragon"" is an absolute must-see for great drama."
2,Over Rated,"I purchased this product for my 3 kids who are 9, 6 and 4 and they became frustrated quickly. They complained of the moves being too fast once they were taught. I agree. The movie also looks like it could be a bootleg movie. Altough this movie is not extremly horrible, I would say save your money. I bought this used for $3 with shipping and tax it came to $6 so i wasnt out of much money."
4,Not typical E. P. Roe!,"I love this author!!! BUT this is my least favorite. While I like the main and secondary characters and the story, this book has very detailed bird stories and bird descriptions, (and scientific details)--- and lest that tempt you, while I found it tedious, there is also a very different view of killing wildlife in this time period which I know modern day readers will find repellent. Read E.P. Roe, he's fabulous and so wise and insightful into character and character defects (more popular than Mark Twain in his day after all!) but don't start with this one!"
2,"Too noisy, too much synth","Being a Black Metal fan, I must say that although this album isn't a total waste of time, Dimmu Borgir surely had done better in the past. It's too noisy, in the bad sense, full of synth taking over the music, which makes it sound like disco, and look, I'm NOT with the ""True Black Metal"" people. Imagine what THEY say about this. Finally, this album is totally immmersed in the poser era of Dimmu Borgir. It doesn't even compare with the older Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, where the music is richer and the use of keyboards hardly takes over."
5,Great for College Dorm Rooms/Basement Kitchen,Love the item. Works well in basement kitchen. Allows a low level of cooking without the expense (or space needed) for a full stove.
2,Spooky Tooth should have stayed home from church.,"Anyone familiar with this album knows that Spooky Tooth's involvement was originally in the context of ""session work."" In other words, Ceremony was never meant to be an official Spooky Tooth album, let alone the follow-up to the superb Spooky Two. The band recorded the tracks for Henry in a matter of days and moved on. Little did they know that their record label would market the LP as a Spooky Tooth album. Evidently, this fiasco was one of the main reasons the band decided to break up in '70. They thankfully reformed later on with help from their pals in Joe Cocker's Grease Band, and were able to create the excellent Last Puff album (which is highly recommended over this mess)."
4,Matty Rich's follow up to the classic Straight Out Of Brookyln,"Matty Rich is proabbly one of the most talented directors you've never heard of. This film about a black teen's summer in Martha's vineyard. Larnez Tate who plays Drew plays this role perfectly as a teen who experiences love,heartbreak and emotion all in one summer. Rich once again proves his talent with this heartfelt film."
5,Most enjoyable and readable,"This is one of the most enjoyable and most readable books I've read on any aspect of astronomy. It does show that some planetary astronomers are a bit more human than they ought to be, putting fame ahead of knowledge, but at least they're fussing about something that might conceivably be useful (but hardly, right?) and not about how old Time is, or how to convince me that there is no center to the universe although 'it did so start with an explosion!'. Much of astronomy, and all of cosmology, is just a big boondoggle for smart graduate students and their mentors, but at least the ones Ken Croswell writes about are almost 'down to earth'."
4,Husky floor liners,Nice mats. They do contain the spills. Mine were supposed to fit a Jeep Patriot but looks like they were really designed to fit a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Passenger side fits nicely but Driver's side not so much.
4,EcoBags,"I ordered four EcoBags, one of which frayed at a seam when washed. When I related this information to EcoBags, I received an apology via e-mail and within a couple of days received a new bag. This bag withstood the wash test and I am very happy with their bags (which are a very good size) and their prompt response. I would recommend these bags to others."
5,Worth every dollar,Doeth every dollar. My points on my 1969 1200 d were giving me nothing but trouble then really ten minutes and two role later and the truck it's running better than ever
4,spray adhesive,"The spray was great. only downside was I think they got cold while shipping, and they just have issues at first, but work great after a little bit."
4,Trying to answer 13 Questions!,"Deep in the darkest hour of a very heavy week three earthmen did confront me and I could hardly speak! They showed me 13 terrors and each one shook my soul. They threw me 13 questions-each one an endless hole! I saw this band at WildWood N.J. Convention Center in 1971 and they were TERRIFIC!. My friends and I wore out our vinyl copy of 13 questions. I haven't been able to hear those words sung for over 20 years. If anyone knows how to get a Cd version of the 13 Questions SeaTrain album( Song of Job, Orange Bloosom Special, I'm Willin'), please send me the info by email. I'll be very very grateful."
5,The Best,"We have 4 cats and 4 dogs who, sometimes make ""mistakes."" And of all the pet stain and odor removers we've used over the years, this one is the best. Works every time. Leaves the carpets fresh and clean. And dogs, cats and owners happy."
1,Absolutely Useless Gadget,I would urge someone to try a simple experiment which will illustrate how useles this device is.Just connect a DVD/Blueray or other device directly over an S-Cable and then connect the same through this booster. I guarantee you will see absolutely zero difference.A lot of people post complaints but don't quantify them clearly. I hope the above makes a compelling case why this gadget is useless.
1,Regret buying,"I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed. First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased, in look or quality. They look and feel cheap. Secondly, this is not a great price for them ($19.99), this is the sticker cost, I have since found out."
5,Flip Flops,"wife loves them says they fit fine great around the house very compatable with contour of her foot and not tiring to wear, like being bare foot http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IMXOTY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Reef Flip Flop,This is the second pair of reef ginger flip flops. I wear them all summer in NY and all winter in Fl. They support my arch and cushion my heel. Best flip flops I have ever owned!
5,Wonderful,"From a woman who spends anywhere between 10 to 24 hours on her feet working, I need comfortable shoes once I leave the hospital too and most especially in the summer. These flip flops were the answer to my prayers. They made me feel as though I was floating when I first slipped them on. I have yet to find out how durable they are, but I have a feeling I will not be disappointed. LOVE these flip flops, and I will NOT be going back to cheap $2 flip flops ever again. Please NEVER discontinue these!"
4,Super Comfy,"These are my first pair of reefs and they're super comfortable. The only problem is that they seem to run a bit small, but they still fit fine. I love the arch support, too."
5,I walk the whole of Manhattan in these,"How do I love thee, Reef Ginger flip flops? Let me count the ways. I am only sad that I could not find a new beige-colored pair this season, because I buy you in every color. I walk the whole of Manhattan in them with no blisters, nothing but total comfort. Literally, these are the one pair of summer shoes I cannot do without."
3,Most comfortable sandle I have EVER worn.,"I've tried a bunch of sandals. NONE are as comfortable as these. I wear them all day long. Even to large theme parks like Disneyland. They cradle the foot and are so comfy. Great shoe. You will buy many pairs of them, guaranteed."
3,Turned my soles black,"The dye on these shoes comes off. I bought this to wear around the house and they are comfortable enough per the other reviews, but they turned the soles of my feet black after an hour of wearing it on the first day. My clean feet looked really dirty after wearing these although I was just walking around on carpet at home."
2,They changed the quality and I am bummed,I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them. I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material. It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it. The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity. The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well. The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft. I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun. When I returned the sole was acutally curled. I am so disappointed. I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with.
1,Unbiased Review,I have used this and didn't like at all. It is not at all good for fine cuttings. you can use it for normal paper cutting etc. very bad.
2,A bit shoddy in quality,"I ordered these at the last minute so I would have a pair of travel scissors for a longer vacation, but wish that I had spent more on a nicer pair. They are difficult to both fold and un-fold, and you have to fiddle with them to get them to lock into place properly. They do a decent job of snipping threads and plastic in a pinch, but I would be happier if they were more solid and sturdy. As such, I can't recommend them."
1,Album Title is Misleading,"I happen to be a fan of flaco's and I like Mr. Meyers music also. But I only purchase Flaco Jimenez music and I was very disappointed and angry that the title that you use, you add Flaco Jimenez name and that is misleading! I wasted my hardearned money since it is not Flaco's music and you should not have this CD listed with Mr. Flaco Jimenez list of CDs and in my opinion it should be removed and put in Mr. Meyers CDs list and not with Mr. Flaco Jimenez list of CDs Thank you for allowing me to let you know of your costly mistake to me and Iam sure to other customers. I only recognise Flaco's accordion music on one song.A dissatisfied customer"
2,The author who could not present himslef as an observer,the author could have come out of cantonment sentiment and describe - what he has - in more detail that why bengalis felt the way they had and then it would have been complete.
4,Stacker?,"Our 12 month old loves this toy! Although she doesn't use it the way she's supposed to - why go through the trouble of stacking the stars to hear the music when you can just push the button on top? Nevertheless, she loves this toy as she loves pushing buttons to hear music - I give this toy 4 stars because my daughter loves it."
4,Very cute toy!,My grandson loves this toy. The batteries died the first day we had which was disappointing. Also you can put the rings on anyway they don't have to go in certain order. The star is difficult for little hands to put on top. Otherwise it is a great toy.
2,Wasn't impressed,"I bought this toy for my daughter's #1 b-day. I got it cuz the reviews were so good on it. My daughter just doesn't like this toy though. She has no interest in it whatsoever - and she isn't a hard baby to please, she likes a lot of things. Just not this."
1,Makes my baby cry everytime!,"My little one is terrified of this! Every time I try to show it to her, she pokes her lip out and gets upset. ??? I tried at 4 mo, and 6 1/2 mo...not a winner in our home."
4,Great toy,"My five month old daughter really loves this toy even though she cannot stack the pieces. She loves the colored rings and enjoys when I stack them to make it play a song. The buttons for the songs got stuck, but we were able to fix it."
5,Top Toy!,"A very entertaining toy that will fit in the diaper bag. This toy bridges the gap between electronic and classic playthings. We received it as a hand-me-down and it has proven durable. Both the stacking stars and musical base have been loved by baby since she was under 3 months. At almost 11 months it is still a favorite (It's being played with as I type! No joke.). The uses for the toy have manifested with the baby's age. At first it was a chew toy and now it is a push-button toy baby dances to each day. Thank goodness the music is pleasant! None of that high-pitched, low quality stuff. Just a note, though--when cleaning the stars, it is best not to submerge them in water or moisture may get trapped inside."
5,New Twist on a Classic Toy,"This is a nice update on toy that has been around for a ton of years -- the ring stacker. This one has stars and also lights and sound, and my now 9 month old son has been thoroughly enjoying it for the past 3 months. He seems to be fascinated by the individual pieces and also, increasingly, the stacking and the sounds. Definitely a fun toy, and one I absolutely recommend."
2,Too hard for baby to get rings on/off,"The rings get caught on the button that triggers the lights and music, making it too difficult to take them off and put them back on again by my little guy while he's learning how to do it. He just gets frustrated and becomes uniterested.We tried the classic rocker stacker and it was so easy to slide the rings on and off and he seems to really like it. He loves stacker cups too!If you already have toys that have music and lights, skip purchasing this particular product and go 'old school style' with it. Save the music/light stimulation for the toys that really need it."
5,Lights up and Makes sounds,Yay for this purchase!!! It is very cool!!! I would recommend for any mom!!! Its so much better than the boring circles!!!
3,Rings are hard to pull out!,"My baby is going on 7 months and the rings are still too big for her little hands to handle not to mention pull out because the plastic star rings are hard to pull out even for me! I honestly thought the toy was made of fabric from the picture, learned lesson from not reading the details thoroughly.Having said the negatives, the toy does have a good repertoire of songs and the blinking lights catches my little one's attention too."
1,Worthless,the skull is made of cheap plastic. item came totally TOOTHLESS because all the teeth fell out during the shipping. packaging is horrid. NOT WORTH THE MONEY
1,Worst packaging idea ever...,"I had actually been avoiding buying Masters of Horror season 2 in hopes it would be released with normal packaging, rather than the collector's edition skull, but after several years, I finally caved and recently ordered it from Amazon.Unfortunately, due to the odd shape of the Masters of Horror season 2 box set casing, it was not properly protected during shipping. As a result, the ""teeth"" fell out/broke and several of the discs were scratched. I recommend anyone looking to purchase this set in the future either buy it on site somewhere, buy it used and give specific packing instructions for the discs to be removed from the skull before shipping and for the skull to be securely wrapped, or download the episodes rather than purchasing a hard copy. But do not purchase it new and expect it to arrive in new condition. This is not necessarily Amazon's fault, so much as whatever fool designed the case."
2,Not recommended,"Way too shallow! Didn't go into things that were heavily emphasized on the test. The review test bank was way too easy. I much preferred ""MCSE Training Guide: Windows95"" by Wolfe and Tidrow. I would have flunked the test if I had used only this book."
2,Not sufficient in and of itself for MCSE test preparation.,"This book will introduce you to all of the concepts covered by the Microsoft exam criteria; however, if you rely soley on the contents of this book for test preparation you will be re-taking the exam at a later date. The MCSE exam questions are quite lengthy and detailed. I found the Windows 95 Resource Kit a better tool, and a critical addition to my professional library. Forget this book."
3,"Good reference, not complete enough for certification prep","The latest edition of this book (for test 70-064) was still riddled with many typos, confusing and incorrect information, and mismatches between review questions and answers. The book was also brief on networks (esp. Novell), which is a major thrust of the certification exam. Windows 95 Resource Kit and practice exams are good additional resources for anyone who wants to be a Windows 95 guru."
2,I forget what the movie is about !,"Again, this was another movie where I can't remember what it's about. What does that tell you ? LOL Wasted my time watching, and I wasted my money !"
4,"Fine, but not great.",It does it's job. But that's about all. It seems pretty front heavy with a few CD's in it and it can be kinda hard to put CD's in this stand.
3,its ok,Nice sleek look. Has a tendency to fall over. The CDs do not fit snuggly and end up skewed in the rack. It is functional though.
2,Questionable translation,"""What is called thinking"" needs to be translated by connotation. Not only do I speak English but also fluently German. ""Was heißt denken"", by Martin Heidegger, translates best ""What does it mean to think?"" That translation gives it life, as Martin Heidegger obviously intended his question.The way this book was translated is out of sink or understanding with Heidegger or any Greek philosopher like Aristotle, and especially not Nietzsche or Hölderlin. Actually it reads boring to the core."
1,mystic theft,"rkl were one of the most gifted and dedicated bands in the punk rock scene, when they were young and naive they signed with mystic records they were payed nothing(1 large pizza actually) for their debut release. it sold extremely well and the band recieved nothing. now that 3 members of that band have passed away mystic(known throughout the scene as ""mistake records"") are trying to rip the band off again with this release, PLEASE WAIT ON THIS PURCHASE, the families of vocalist jason sears,drummer bomer, and former drummer derrick plourd and the remaining members of the band are in the process of securing profits from this release for the families of the deceased. mystic records suck, they rip off bands ask NOFX.thanks and remember.... KEEP LAUGHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,8 songs about dinamite,The record containes 8 songs in good old Batmobile energetic style by different authors ranging from B.B.King to Scorpions all with the word 'DINAMITE' in the titles. Disappointing is the length of the record - 16.28!
5,How to stop worrying and start living,A great book with a life experience it gives you how the life works and how to handle it.It gives you the wisdom of life.Since I have read the book I stopped being worry at all.
3,I am skeptical.,"Everything in this book is very true. I would feel wonderful while reading it: like I am capable of combating my anxiety. But as soon I close this book it all comes back to me, and Mr. Carnegie's methods are not working anymore. I think this book is helpful overview of all well-known the methods and logical reasons to stop worrying. It is also easy to read. But it doesn't help you to stop worrying. At least it didn't help my anxiety problem. Maybe if your case is milder, this book will help you. The only thing it did for me - made me more worried about how much I worry. It goes on and on about how worrying is bad for you."
3,how to stop worrying and start living,good book and transaction the only comment is it said the book was new but it looks old and/or used
1,"""Good"" Used Book","I'd like to write a review of the book but the previous owner underlined every other paragraph. If I want a book underlined, I'll do it myself."
5,Another Excellent book by Carnegie,"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living focuses on the importance of ones attitude. It is as applicable today as when it was written. A good attitude is crucial in helping a person improve his or her life and relationships with others. Although we all know these principles, this book is a great reminder that by appreciating life we enjoy life.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
5,The Worry TERMINATOR,"The true cause of all human suffering is worry. This book will give you plenty of guidelines from which to choose to FIGHT WORRY HEADS ON! It won't turn your life around instantly, but if you truly follow and practice the contents, you'll soon realize the true meaning of LIVING. The best sentence I found in this book,which you can use instantly to fight worry and give you an insight to the true worth of this fabulous book is ""CROWD WORRY OUT OF YOUR MIND"" - you do that by keeping yourself occupied all the time. Goodluck!"
4,Remember...,"This is a very down to earth book. He talks to you like an uncle. Ive read the Dahli llamas Art of Happieness, and this is like a layman version of that.But remember that these ideas can easily be forgotton when you put the book down. Dale even says that. Rememeber to keep reading this every few months to keep the ideas in your head. Habits are HARD to break.Read it a few times"
1,Not as advertised,"I am sure that this book will serve the needs of most of the buyers as a competent treatment of the subject area. I am studying for the exam and wanted two things: A large set of practice questions for drill purposes (the cd had 30 questions) and a portable reference copy of the book. The ebook included can only by read from the cd according to the text file that comes with it, but in fact for me the book was totally unreadable from the CD on a PC or a Mac with serveral different versions of the adobe reader that I tried. I am not interested in reading a 900 page book just to pass an exam and found that the dummies book plus the testking questions were enough. This book did not suit my needs at all."
3,Wonderful insight,"Wow, what a book, it gives new perspective on what it means to be a Christian in a world of true love and clean sex. How did anyone ever not come to undersatnd such a veritable cacophany of peerless wonders in such a litany of inexorable prose beyond the innefable light of our soulishness from whence the peace of God came. The writer was in a space of continual effigy and discourse withon his own spirit of peace and tronia, sort of as an passable bodhisatva in a clear spring of luminous water land."
1,Not recommended,"I only got through the first two chapters of this book, and I couldn't finish it. I'm an avid mystery reader, so I know what it takes to ""hook"" a reader. This book didn't have it. The setting was depressing, the characters uninteresting and unlikable, and I honestly didn't care about the storyline. If the main heroine turns you off, there's not much incentive to keep reading. Heaven Lee, a many-times-married former stripper, has no positive personality traits that make the reader care about her. I regret buying all the books in the series before reading the first. I will not read the others."
2,Confusion Reigns,"I can't say I was overly impressed with the first installment of this series.I found nothing at all to like about Heaven...she just seemed to come through as some kind of low-life without any redeeming qualities. The supporting cast is just that...you don't get to know a thing about them. Plus, there were so many supporting characters with common/similar names (Chris, Joe, Hank, Sam, Sal, Sol) that I had trouble keeping them all straight. I also found the recipes right in the middle of the text to be annoying.I've already bought the next two books in the series, so I'll read them...whether I continue or not after that is still up in the air."
4,classic Sci-fi,"Old science fiction, a nice double feature for the fiction buff, War of the worlds is a totally different concept from modern fiction thrillers, no blood guts and carnage - chivalry of another age gone past.worth checking out."
3,A 5-star and a 2-star in one,"I picked this up recently because it offered 2 Sci-fi ""classics"" for just a little more than the price of one. Also, this was my first tme to see ""When Worlds Collide."" Referring to the latter, what a bore! Wooden acting, from mostly unknowns, and lack of any excitement or development to the story. I could hardly sit through it. Its hard to believe it averages a 4-star rating. The story idea is good and the transfer quality is good, but thats about it. Of course ""War of the Worlds"" is a great film in all respects but I agree with another reviewer that it is best purchased separately to get the other perks."
4,Loved Learning From a Playboy,"This Playboy book by Carly Phillips is a lot of fun -- in fact it's a downright romp through the bedrooms and boudoirs of the mind, and if you liked the Bachelor you will definitely FLY through this well-written next-installment from its talented author. I also had a great time recently with another ""playboy"" type of book which was more of an instructional memoire by Clint Arthur called ""9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power."" It's also extremely sexy in its settings and situations, but in Clint's case he's out to teach just as much as he is to entertain, and not only did I enjoy reading it, I also LEARNED alot about how to give my lover pleasure, and how to use that power to boost every aspect of life. Both of these Playboy books are well worth your while, it just depends if you want pure fantasy, or if you want sexy stories that will improve your life."
1,Inspirational Drivel,"This is the kind of book that inspires me. As I read, I think to myself, ""I can't believe this got published. I could write something better than this!"" Thus inspired that some day I could become a published author. After all, that's how Kay Hooper got started!The plot was okay, but I found the writing simple and repetitious. The characters were shallow and predictable."
4,A fun read...,"This book was my first experience with reading Carly Phillips. I didn't realize it was the second in the trilogy about the brothers until a little ways in and I didn't want to stop reading by then just to get the first book out of the way before reading onward!The book is pretty predictable, like most chick lit at this level, but I was pleased with the quick read and will be checking out the other works by this author. I felt that the characters were well-developed and quite witty in some cases. They displayed emotion and ""realness"" - a nice treat! The plot was beyond basic and did include some fun twists.I do recommend this book. I made me laugh several times and I look forward to reading about the other brothers and their searches for true love!"
4,Good stand at a good price,"At first I thought the paint finish was too flat, but now we like it a lot. It's a sturdy stand with a great design, and looks great in our historic home. It's not cheap looking in any way, despite the good price. Screwing the arms on was a bit challenging as there was a bit of wobble to them, so you have to be sure to tighten them hard once they're properly lined up with the holes. That's the only reason I didn't give it five stars."
2,Don't bother with this one.,"This item arrived damaged. The quality is poor to begin with. A phone call to the company resulted in a very prompt replacement of the damaged pieces, so I can at least now use the item, but I will be replacing it with a different coat rack of more substantial quality ASAP."
1,Coat Rack,Holes and screw are not made properly and the whole rack stays loos. I had to use bigger screw to fix it. Fast shipping
4,Only one star short,This coat/umbrella rack is great!! I love it . It's big and sturdy and beautiful . So easy to assemble and the price was well worth it especially with the free supersaver shipping . I love amazon . The only reason for not 5 starring it is because the painted finish in some places is very thin . Luckily the spots are in the inside bottom of the umbrella stand portion so the umbrellas cover it .All parts were there and no wobble or tilts at all !!
4,coat rack w/ umbrella stand,"This is a nice product and we are pleased with it. The one issue that I have with it is that the coat rack hangers need to be attached when you get it. The design of the way they are attached could be better. You can't get all of the ""wabble"" out of them because the screws can't be but so tight without stripping them out. Even when tightened as much as possible, the coat rack arms do not feel secured, there is some play in them. A simple design change where the mounting hardware screws went all the way through the pole and used a nut to secure them in place would help. The re-designed attachment would also need some sort of seat that the armes fit against (between the arm and the Poll)so that when tightened the arm would not wobble from side to side.You can send me a payment for my great idea of improving this product and making it an outstanding product of great value."
3,"Sound quality is a little poor, not easy to hear what they are saying",Audio level is a little to low because of the back ground noises that was intentionally added in the review.
4,COFFEE MAKER DO'S & DON'TS,"DO NOT POUR COLD WATER IN THE RESIVOUR. IT LEAKS. DO NOT SET UP THE NIGHT BEFORE, IT WILL LEAK ALL OVER. IF YOU MAKE THE COFFEE JUST BEFORE YOU HAVE SOME, IT WORKS WELL. IT DOES MAKE A GOOD CUP OF COFFEE. MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT THE WHOLE UNIT LEAKS WATER FROM UNDER THE UNIT. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A CRACK OR CRACKS IN THE UNDERSIDE OF THE DUAL STRUCTURE. ALSO CHECK THE MANUFACTURE PRICE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE FROM AMAZON, AS AMAZON WAS OVER $50.00 OVER THE MANUFACTURES PRICE LISTING. I WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT. WHEN NOT LEAKING, IT MAKES GOOD COFFEE."
4,Not for emergency caffeine fix,"I love the dual pots. I purchased this for the breakroom at my office. We brew decaf on one side and the real stuff/""high test"" on the other side. The only drawback is that it takes a while to brew the pot. The joke is to put it on at the start of your shift so it's ready by coffee break time! The coffee is good, though. Definitely recommend the purchase."
2,Commercial bullshit !!!,"This CD is a mistake in Saxon's history. Like many other traditional metal bands from the 80's (Judas Priest, for example), they tried to adapt themselves to survive in the Glam phase of Metal, which almost destroyed the genre for good! THeir effort was this weak Cd, with no heart at all, Very bad!"
1,Not for motorized bicycles,This product was easy to install and worked for 3.9 milesthen it quit I assume internal components will not withstandspeeds and vibration when used on Motorized bicycles otherwisea decent looking product
3,Jonathan Davis,"Installed on Motorized 26"" Schwinn 3 wheel. Love the looks, speed is a little off and no way to adjust it. Had to remove a bearing tensioning nut for it to fit between forks (didnt like that) no way I could spread the forks more that 1/4"" to get wheel on. It does work though you just have to make a mental correction to speed and distance. Odometer is realy just a trip meter."
5,SUPER CHEAP AND WORKS GREAT,"EASY TO INSTALL EVEN WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS. HAS WORKED GREAT SO FAR, IT IS ALL PLASTIC WHICH SUCKS BUT FOR 6 DOLLARS PLUS SHIPPING ITS WELL WORTH IT. JUST MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING IS BINDING UP OR YOU WILL BRAKE IT"
5,Speed Zone !,"This produce checked out with my vehicle. Easy to install, easy to read safely while riding."
3,speedometer,"does not fit greenline beach bikes.I installed one on a mountain bike,found it to be noisy,except at low speeds."
1,I am not happy with my purchase.,"The speedometer looks good, but it doesn't look like the one I ordered. They sent me the KPH one, which would be fine it I lived in Europe. I wouldn't have minded as much if it didn't say which one it was and then I got a KPH one, but it clearly states ""Product Description: For 26-27"" Wheel Sizes Reads in MPH/RPM's."" Other flaws include: the odometer doesn't work, no directions were included, and the cable is too long. It's working right now but I hate that I have to convert my speed into MPH to know how fast I'm going. Also from what everyone else has said it's going to break soon. I really wish I could say it was worth the $15 but it's not. Maybe $6.50."
4,Speedometer,"It is nice, but it does slow your bike down a little. The way it is hooked on slows down the tires some in the front. I had to go to the battery operated one due to this, since I have a mountain bike. If you are traveling on straight roads it would be okay."
4,Good While It Lasted,"Length:: 1:22 MinsThis speedometer worked great, I used it on my 26"" tire for my sedona dx mountain bike. It was accurate, and it looked cool. I got up to 45mph downhill with it! But, theres two negatives: 1.) The wires to short and had to stretch it some. 2.) It's a hassle to put on. If I could get a new wire with no cost and longer, that would be great. Sorry for the video direction, I recorded it and thought it had my face in it."
4,Bike speedomter with odometer,The speedometer works well and the odomter let's you know how far you have ridden. The price is definitely right but it should come with installation instructions.
1,":Looks good, works bad",Good classic look however it is so inaccurate that its not even funny. I rode up my 60' driveway and back and it recorded 2 miles and I did 60mph. Is good for looks but not for any accurate accessment of speed or mileage.
1,Just used it for three weeks and it broke,I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. We live in Michigan so he didn't begin using it until the good weather came about three weeks ago. It just stopped working. Completely broken. I checked the return policy and noticed that since we've had the speedometer since December we are only entitled to a partial refund and we have to pay shipping costs. Well I guess we'd lose money if we did that so we'll have to chalk it up to experience. Just thought others should know for future reference.
4,An excellent history of the rules of the game,"This book is a ""must-have"" for anyone who loves the game. It not only explains the rules in detail, it often gives the history of the rules as well.The authors clearly did their research in the writing of this book. It is full of baseball anecdotes that are both informative and educational about the history of our national pastime.A truly enjoyable book. I highly recommend it."
5,The most important biz book since,"Seth Godin has written what may be the most groundbreaking business book since ""In Seach of Excellence"" hit in the early 1980's. Whether you run your own one-person shop (when you get down to it, we all run our own shop) or you're working in a Fortune 500 company, this book is a MUST READ. Seth's insite into why old marketing models no longer work--and what is working in today's business environment--will totally change your perspective on marketing in the 2000's. The best part is that Seth has boiled this down to an easy read that a 5th-grader could understand. EVERYONE working in any job should read this book. Look, if you're a manager, take advantage of Seth's generous volume discount and get copies of this book for everyone in your company. This book is the bible of marketing!"
1,"Shallow, insipid, lacks insight, junk marketing","Seth Godin's books never cease to amaze me - he is the ultimate self promoter, but this does not translate into useful marketing insights in his books. Purple Cow, is no exception. Only someone who is still in primary school would be impressed - ye have been warned..."
3,GREAT CASE STUDIES.,"Purple Cow is a good but not a great book.A purple cow? How strange and fascinating could that be? This books talks about how a product can be a Purple Cow (So Remarkable that can't be ignored).The best thing about this book is all the case studies that Seth Godin talks about; Like all of Godin's books, this is an original book about the new practice of marketing."
3,"Interesting and Informative, but...","As a small business owner, I was recommended this book on the hopes that it would break the mold of every other business book I've read, namely that it would be able to provide more than just broad theories that were not necessarily applicable to the ""real world"". While it did provide some excellent case studies and some very good ideas, from a personal level I felt that it focused to much on products and not enough on services, which I feel is a much harder area to ""be remarkable"" as it is not a tangible good.I completely understand the philosophy and the usefulness that some might find from it, but it didn't really do me much good. I am sure I can use parts of it, but I guess my expectations were too high. I can, however, understand the value that others might find from it and so might rate it higher."
1,"Obvious, Random, Superficial Observations","In my opinion this book is no more than a random collection of superficial thoughts & observations. There is no depth. Nothing substantial can be gathered from this book.I find the author's 1 page, vague recommendations completely useless. (Refer to ""what should tide do? What should hallmark.com do?"") There is nothing much in it that can be acted upon."
2,Nothing for small business,Who is he writing this book for? Nothing for small business and toolight for big business !! The kindle edition costs more than thenew paperback ??? Looks like greed to me. I will never pay theseridiculous kindle prices !!!!!!!!!!! Overpriced when was new andway overpriced as a kindle book.
4,Not your usual infomercial--worth the read,"Having attended many business improvement seminars I am a bit jaded when it comes to a new book or seminar that preaches the latest corporate mantra. However, Purple Cow is one book that really held my attention.Most improvement books give you one or two very general tips and very little substance. Purple Cow was packed with information and concepts for getting a business noticed in a world where customers are already deluged with multimedia advertising from every direction.I would have rated this book higher except that I had a string disagreement with one of the author's basic premises that massive advertising campaigns were a complete waste of time in the current market. Otherwise, I would highly endorse this book and recommend it to new companies just starting out."
3,kind of a fun collectible,"There's no music on this CD, just an interview with MC. It's an interesting piece of Mariah history, because here you are hearing her thoughts and hearing her personality after her first album was pressed but before she knew how big it was going to be -- how big SHE was going to be.A fun piece of history to own, and for the price it's not too bad a deal."
5,Exellent cd of vintage 1930's-40's Danzoneras,"If you like to dance in the style of danzon, or if you like Cuban jazz, and want to look to it's roots, look no further(although there are cd's that cover 1906-thru the teens and 20's). Those who think all Cuban music is Salsa and cha cha cha, loo kagain, Salsa and Son Montuno's roots all come from Danzon, which essentially is African jazz(think Latinized ragtime). This music is irresistable and catchy. Exotic rhythms, loads of jazz syncopation, and a pure rhythmic delight! Great cd, especially the 1930's selections!"
3,It works,the book will teach you how to do the cube. I believe nobody could figure this out without a load of notes and a lot of time.
1,Not Patricia Cornwell,"I bought this book w/ the anticipation that I had finally found someone to keep me preoccupied until PC comes out with her next book. This was terrible. The characters were ridiculous and although it was a guess until the end, the story line was bland. Lena is a horrible character - her past and the way is she is treated and treats others is really down right disgusting. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,"Absolutely Horrible!!!!!!!!! (reveals some plot twists, careful when you read)","I have suffered through 2 previous novels by this author, and honestly found them to at least finish well. Well, this one I could not even get past the first 50 pages. I am a healthcare worker, and as one I demand a certain level of truth to stories that depict healthcare situations. I allow for a level of literary license, but when it extends to essentially making things up, I tend to be unable to follow the story. When Sara's sister is stabbed and found ""bleeding out"" she would be DEAD!!!!!! To survive a trauma like that is to unbelievable for me to continue reading this book, let alone any further books from this author. I am sorry to say that but to ""soak"" a shirt and sport coat, have intestines coming out of a wound and suffer a chest stab wound and massive scalp laceration and survive is just wrong.Sorry, just my opinion."
5,KARIN SLAUGHTER HOOKS ME AGAIN,"I am hooked on Karin Slaughter books. Her characters are not ""perfect"" people, but flawed and real. Her story lines are rather gory, but no more so than what I read in the daily newspapers. She grips the reader from the beginning to the end. As a reader I can't wait to get to the end, but once I do, I want more.This book is a great beach read or one to read when you have time, as you won't want to put it down.I do suggest that you read her books in order of print. They are not sequential, but the characters and the story line are carried through her books.I want more and hope she keeps writing for a long time."
2,Would have given 5 stars,"but the ending completely floored me. This series was a page turner for me throughout...very well written, but after the ending of this last one in the Grant County series, I refuse to pick up another one from her. What a let down."
5,Another excellent thriller!,"As always I enjoyed this book of Karin Slaughter's, very good plot and her characters are very well developed. Looking forward to her next book!"
4,Perfect for on-the-go,"this cd/dvd wallet was very compact, making it perfect for tossing into my hand-carry along with our dvd player for my 2-year old. I found the inner sleeves to be a bit snug for the dvd's, but all-in-all, I have no complaints. it was a good value for the price, and the exterior cover was very durable and withstood ""toddler testing""."
4,Does What It Claims,"Greg Norman's Secret successfully keeps the right wrist hinged during the downswing, helping golfers cure any tendency to flip the clubhead up at the ball. Add in a good swing path, and you've got great contact with the ball."
3,Works pretty well,You can still flip even with this on. But it's a good training aid that has helped me to some degree.
1,"Save your money, it's not a keeper","One of our foursome bought this thing and we all tried it over the next 3 weeks before it was returned. Greg's secret is he just picked your pocket for 28 bucks. It will hold your wrist back for a proper lag but it is uncomfortable and doesn't feel natural. And because of those two reasons you won't get mussel memory to hold that lag on your down stoke. The mind isn't going to repeat a certain wrist angle when it associates it with pain. A much better tool is a Smash Bag, 5 or 6 different companies make them and it is a true training tool. You will get much better on squaring up at impact and learning to delay your release to get that distance creating lag. I think Greg would be better off putting his name on a poster for restaurants on how to do the Heimlich maneuver, after all he is the King of Chokers, and thats no secret."
2,So Long Shirt,"The shirt is great looking and well made; however, it is so very long. I ordered the shirt in regular size, but it's much longer than those in most tall sizes. I'm over six feet and the shirt hem hangs down almost to my knees. What's not mentioned in the shirt description, is that it is almost three feet long."
2,No music from the show.,"Perhaps I'm missing somehting here but I just saw the show delirum and LOVED the music so of course I had to get the soundtrack, but these are not the same songs, and definitely not my style. So if you like the show music, don't get this CD."
3,"So, so...","""Up in Smoke"" is still THE classic Cheech & Chong movie. I'd never seen ""Still Smokin'"" and it left me shaking my head. I felt it was an effort to simply capitalize on the wild success of the original movie. Some funny skits, sure, but lots of over-the-top and silly skits as well."
4,Outstanding for 4 out of 6 parts,"The young Fisher is full of enthousiasme, which can be both a blessing and a detriment. The first sonata/partita pair is very intellectual and, in this recording, is suffering from an attempt at reading more to the score than music that lives on its own and does not need artifices. For example, the fuga at 3 voices of the first sonata is played here like if it were only at 2 voices because of an attempt to add romantic lyrism to the score. That attitude pays more with the last 2 pairs of sonata/partita where Julia Fisher provides a very good interpretation.All in all, this is a valid attempt by a young player who will re-interpret those works when she is more mature and then reach perfection. Very promising."
4,"Great Item, Poor description","I bought this Kowa Spotting Scope for my husband for Christmas. I was super excited to recieve it in the mail but to my surprise when I opened it, it was missing the eyepiece. The picture online and the description in the posting do not mention that the eyepiece is something that you have to buy separately. It was sucky that I had to then order the eyepiece that was almost just as expensive as the spotting scope itself! I just wish that the description had been very blatant that the eyepiece was not included.But we love the spotting scope and have used it on many hunting excursions."
4,Good storage,"This is a good storage solution for CDs. I wanted to get something I put away in a 27"" cabinet and this worked fine. The strips of metal used to screw into the wall are a little rough for pulling out of the cabinet, but that is not the way the CD tower is supposed to be used."
5,Al corriente review,I received the book quickly and it was in good condition. The way the seller described it was the way I got it. I was very satisfied
2,"Not Great, but ok","I got this movie on sale a couple years ago. It looked pretty good, but you know how most of that goes. I really lke movies like Scream, I thought it would be like that, but nope. This movie was a hundred percent perdictable. I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie. From the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck. *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out. The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax. This is what happens throughout the entire movie. Don't waste your time or money. If you really want to see it i would suggest renting it... not worth more than 3.00 anytime!"
1,great colors,Eagle looks animated so not happy with this one at all but did not return. I will cut the sleeves off and wear it around the house only. Of all things to look phoney the eagle should not be one of them. I would not reccomend this design.
2,Two songs but nothing else,"I liked two songs from Aspects of Love that I heard on a collection of Andrew Lloyd Weber. Unfortunately, they were the only items I liked; I didn't care for the story line behind the show."
1,Let me see if I've got this right...,"...A 17-year-old boy has an affair with an actress in her twenties, who then marries the boy's uncle. Fourteen years later, the boy, now 31, is back -- and has an affair with the 14-year-old daughter of his uncle and his own ex-mistress. Then, for good measure, he runs off with another ex-mistress, this one his uncle's.I'm a big Andrew Lloyd Webber fan in general, but I can see why this one is widely considered an embarrassment. Even in these relaxed times, an affair (Alex-Jenny) that constitutes child molestation, with an element of incest thrown in, is bound to put many people off their feed.Go back to EVITA and PHANTOM, and forward to SUNSET BOULEVARD. Show your respect for Andrew by giving this one a miss."
1,flannel pjs,"Was led to believe in description that the pajamas were ankle length when we received them come to find out they were knee length, and when the shipping was half of what the item had cost we found it to be more of a hassle..will not order again"
2,workbook already totally written in,"This workbook was sold as having no markings in it, however the entire workbook was written in and could not be used. I had to return it."
1,Here comes my fourth repairman in the first year...,This guy has been spotty since the day we got it.We've had little to no control over temperature.Our 2nd of 4 repairmen (in one year of ownership) found one end of a bottle to be 13 degrees different than the other end of the same bottle.Not only is that far beyond the instructions' projectionsof 5 degree accuracy...it's a scientific phenomenon.Now I'm finding that setting it to HI gives us a lower temp than LO(the opposite of our readings after the 3rd repairman).Again this seems scientifically impossible.I can only conclude that my unit has achieved artificialintelligence and is making up new ways to screw up.It's brilliant at that...but crummy at chilling wine.
1,"Avanti Service is non existent, no one stands behind product","Purchase Avanti wine chiller, had nothing but issues since it stopped working, they don't servivce it, PC Richard where I purchased it does not service it and I cannot find anyone locally who will even look at it. Such a waste"
2,Won't fit a one gallon jug.,I brew small batches in one gallon glass jugs. Those stoppers are way too small to fit the opening. They look like they would work great if only they fit.
5,You'll be singing!,"I was lucky enough to see The Producers when it was being previewed in Chicago. I've never laughed so hard! I preordered the CD and waited impatiently. I finally received it and have been listening ever since. When I'm unable to listen, the songs continue through my head! All the tunes are catchy, you won't be able to forget them. It's also a great way to relive the actual production until I can manage to fly out to New York and see it again. I Love It!!!"
4,Why see the play? The best stuff is right here!,This cast recording is great stuff.Your enjoyment will be even more if you've seen the video about the recording of this recording. It was on PBS during their fund-raising and can be purchased here too.
4,Caveat Emptor,"I like the book itself. I agree with what others have said regarding being comprehensive and a good beginning German book. However, the CD leaves a bit to be desired and although the book offers a ""key code"" from the publisher in order for you to access an online help site affiliated with the book, you would not know this until you open the book and have thrown away the packaging. I tried to get the key code and could not get it. Therefore, although I purchased a new book, the 8th edition thru Amazon, I am unable to access a premium componenet of the book that I should have been able to use...thus...caveat emptor!"
3,Cooks great but exterior looks ugly after a lot of cooking,"I've had these pans for a number of years now. I usually cook several times a day almost everyday & although these pans cook beautifully and the interior looks beautiful, the anodized exterior looks terrible now. I wouldn't mind so much but I have them hanging on decorative pot rack. For that reason I want to replace them with the less expensive version in stainless steel but the financial loss is killing me. I don't have room in my small kitchen to put them away. We've had a stainless steel All-Clad sauce pan for a few years which still looks great and isn't embarrassing hanging from our rack. If you don't mind so much what your pots look like then these would probably be a great choice. If anyone knows any great secrets to keeping these looking great, please post them. I've contacted All-Clad several times and do exactly as they say without achieving any desired results."
4,"Great conversation, DVD quality need improvement","We own several of the Vision Forum DVD's and enjoy them. They are generally of high quality and quite affordable. Dr. Paul Jehle is a dynamic speaker and this DVD captures and keeps the attention of the viewer. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 8 as it is basically a recording of a talk. The drawbacks are that there are several audio glitches during the program and once the incorrect slide is displayed. I would also note that this DVD sells for $15 at Vision Forum, so I'm not sure why some people are charging nearly $40 for it here."
2,Pretty Basic Stuff,"I was really disappointed to see that this book had less recipes and more of an essay on why you should cut back on fat, sodium and sugar. A good 1/3 of the book is explaining why we should eat healthier and ways to do so. Even with that goal in mind, most of the recipes have salt, sugar and processed foods in them, not to mention the largest section was on red meat while fish and vegetable based dishes were pretty scant. As for the recipes, I only found 1 that I will use, the others are all really very basic.If you don't already know how to top a pizza with veggies, make mac and cheese or rice and beans then go ahead and buy this book."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed in this book. I returned it. Simplistic with very little information I wanted.
5,A MUST-HAVE!!,"We checked this one out from our local library and the next day, I ordered it through Amazon. We were so impressed by the logic and straight-talk Liz and Janice provided, and not one of the recipes looked ""crazy."" Just regular meals, jazzed up to make them MUCH better, MUCH healthier. We also ordered their ""No Whine with Dinner"" at the same time, and are actually eating a dinner from that one tonight! Worth the purchase!"
4,Hilarious,"This series is hugely funny. A mixture of snark and childlike glee come out as the crew reviews drool-worthy vehicles and partakes ridiculous challenges. As a Yankee I don't know most of the Stars that they stick in their Reasonably Priced Car, but I still enjoy the segment. Similarly, I have no idea what half the Britjokes they make actually mean, but I consider it cultural research. I'm a supporter of this show and can't see myself ever enjoying the Americanized version.Buy this: if you like to laugh, enjoy cars, like watching people try to do things with little or old cars that they were never intended to do.Don't buy this: if you have a fear of tall men with wool-like hair or racing helmets."
5,Amazing book...completely hot!,"First timers was by-far one of the hottest things to read. The definition,detail and story lines on the different stories (and a huge range of first timers) is simply beautiful. Being able to relate to some (not all) of the stories was really awesome...and not being able to pull away and stop reading was my indication that i really enjoyed it. i'll be lookin forward to reading more. =]"
5,These are must-haves!,"We got these for my husband's dad and he loves them! We have some for our truck too and they are great. They are very easy to clean, especially since my husband and his dad are both dirty-boot kinda guys :) If you have a truck, you gotta get these!"
1,false advertising,"does not show the complete race like the advertisment says...only shows segments of the race, was disapointed...i thought i was getting the complete race like some of the others i have purchased."
5,Excellent,"Excellent, well-made product. The two side holders are spring loaded, and have smooth operation opening and closing around the pen, pencil, or other object being held. The rotation angle of the mount has detents, which provide tactile feedback as the mount is rotated to the perfect angle. Exemplary implementation of great form following a well-defined function."
2,Those Bette Davis Eyes,"I found the movie way too long. The sound quality was very poor and the movie repeatedly became disconnected I also think there are better Bette Davis movies out there. In any case, it is always nice to see Miss Davis act. Will try to see some other Bette Davis movies on Amazon Instant Video."
5,Such a good movie!,"I found this movie by accident and fell in love with it instantly. The acting is great, but what else would you expect from Bette Davis? This movie really deserves more attention than it's had as of yet. The film inspired me to read the book by Rachel Field, which is amazing. I'd advise anyone to read the book and see the movie as soon as possible!"
5,DVD format please!,"I adored this movie! After seeing it, I was compelled to read the book by Rachel Field. Bette Davis did an excellent job of portraying Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the loving, quick-witted governess falsely accused of being associated with the notorious Praslin murder that helped to bring down the French monarchy. After reading the book and seeing the movie, I was surprised that it took the Duc so long to lose it with the Duchesse. See the movie or read the book and you'll probably agree with me. This movie was amazing and it showed me what a versatile actress Bette Davis was. This isn't her normal brand of movie. I was intrigued when I found out that it was based on a true story, that's why I read the book. My only disappointment with the movie is that it isn't on DVD yet! I really wish they'd release the DVD version of it, I'd buy it the second it came out!"
5,hello..??? donde esta en version de dvds,"bueno realmente me sorprende que este clasico..con un elenco sorprendente.. no este en dvd,,,favor a los de la warner tomar esto en consideracion ya que.. muchos queremos tener esta peliculasaludosgood really it surprises that this clasic ..with a wonderful cast. not this in dvd,, favor to those of warner to already take this in consideration that. many we want to have this movie greetings"
5,bought for homeschool read-aloud to supplement Science curric,"My children (ages 9&11). We used the Burgess Bird Book to supplement our Ornithology text, and The Story Book of Science to supplement Entomology. The kids enjoy it so much that we are continuing to read the chapters not about insects, just for fun."
4,Excellent product,"I have been searching for a small organizer, something simple to keep addresses, appointments, etc. This organizer was just what I needed - also has plenty of memory and dowloading from Outlook was very simple."
3,A word on a word of caution. (revised),"I own a battered, black (much beter than the silver) OZ-650 and there is a way on mine to repeat events. Playing with the newer ones at the store, it seems that they can't do this. That's a shame, I really like mine and was looking to replace it with a newer one. I can type on mine, but I have disproportionally small hands for a guy. The only two things I like better on my wife's Handspring are the games and it is part of the biggest herd technologicaly."
1,watts floodsafe 3/8 by -1/2 inch faucet connector,"I installed one connector to the cold water one connector to the hot water line in my laundry sink following the to the mfg.instruction, it does not work well at all, if you open the faucet very slow than it is fine,if you open the faucet normal speed the connector will shut the water off right away. The hot water side did not reset for a long time the cold water side reset itself fast, if you open the faucet very slow than stays open. They seting on the shelf till I will put them in the garbage."
2,Handles too thin for easy maneuvers,Just bought this set and immediately struck by how thin and uncomfortable the handles are. I really like to cook (having been a cook at a French restaurant) and flip vegetables and like to move the pans around quickly and these do not make it easy. The edges of the pan are sharp and not quite as thick as I expected. Not really happy with the purchase.
4,Refreshing,"""In Control"".., is a follow-up to a fabulous composition to his story ""Out of Control"". The book helps to identify goals and purpose one finds within him or herself by keeping it real. This time the softer edges are apparently milder in nature but completes a described journey of hope."
1,One-trick Pony,"Almost every single story in this monotonous collection is told from the first-person viewpoint of a youngish male angry narrator who has an inferiority complex about more successful men, a physically flawless girlfriend whom he treats with contempt, and an obsession with money and status. I think either the stories in a collection should be linked, with the same narrator (as in Junot Diaz's ""Drown"") or demonstrate some range. Two of these narrators both had former girlfriends who wet the bed when drunk. I mean, couldn't he think of anything else? I think it's fine to have unattractive and offensive narrators if there's a point, otherwise it's gratuitously oppressive. I have never written a bad review before because I think it's generally not a good thing to do, but this book was so irritating and felt like such a waste of money that I couldn't help myself."
3,Funny stories on postmodern (or postmodem?) male crisis,"The stories are funny, and are a good, cynical portrait of the insecurities and confusions of your typical heterosexual ( or something... read Sam the Cat's story)post-feminism,post-modern,postmodem male. The only flaw is that some stories appear too packed and too rushed. A more attention to details and athmosphere would have helped"
5,Great Condition,Extremely happy with the condition of my book and the time period in which it arrived!
5,Assertive behavior is more than defending your rights!,"This book goes beyond the standard publications on assertiveness. It defines assertive behavior not only as an effective communication style, but as a way of being in the world. Assertive behavior allows one to be self-expressive of ideas and opinions without denying the rights of others. It also means being able to communicate feelings of warmth and love to others. The authors' step-by-step process for increasing assertiveness is invaluable in helping both men and women understand the concept of assertive behavior and practically apply it to life situations."
5,Great Movie to watch,This movie was hilarious. Even though singing is what Kelly does on a regular basis she really put her all into this movie. The first time I saw the preview was at the Destiny's Child concert. Though it was only playing at Imax theatres in certain areas. I was upset. I was going crazy looking around for this movie. It later came DVD almost a year later. I finally found it and laughed from the begining to the end. D. Ray is silly along with Dwayne Martin. They couldnt have done better with the actors and actress's they choose for this movie. It will be money well spent....
2,Off Brand,"I couldnt even watch this movie all the way through. I am gonna try to watch it again, but the start of it is what is supposed to grab your attention. Nothing kept me into this movie."
3,"Change in Recipe, But Still Pretty Good","I had one of the ""tiger"" boxes of Bengal Spice tea for quite some time, but never tasted it. When I finally tasted it, I was delighted. It was superb. (Bengal Spice is, by the way, a combination of spices and of roasted chickory.)I don't care much for green tea. But Bengal Spice was so good that I was able to steep it with bags of green tea, producing an excellent combination.I couldn't wait to order a six-pack of Bengal Spice. But one of the recent reviews that I had read was correct. The formulation is dramatically different.The tea that I just received is pretty good. I only found it to be ""good"" by adding a bit of apple juice. Unfortunately, it's no longer superb.On well, I guess I'll buy more anyway. I just don't care that much for the taste of green trea."
5,Should have 6 stars,"Finally found the ultimate in tea. The flavor and quality are what we have been looking for for many years. Another plus--the strength is outstanding. You can get at least two cups with one bag. In fact we leave the used bag in a little water, and the next day, add more water and heat (we use a microwave), and it's strong enough to drink and enjoy. We're introducing it to our family and friends, and they are turning into addicts also."
3,"Hey, at least the kid's liked it.","Terrible acting (almost amusingly so) but a decent, though not very original, story. But hey, the kids (ages 3 & 6) like it, which is really the whole point."
5,The Messenger arrives,"Quicksilver Messenger Service (self titled): The compositions on this album are terrific. ""Pride of Man"" and ""Dino's Song"" got radio airplay because they were the right length and had lyrics (and they were very good songs). The rest of the songs are equally good and should have become classics in their own right if the radio stations would have had the guts to ignore their silly requirement and played them. This album is not remembered as well as the albums of their contemporaries (The Dead and The Airplane) but it is at least their equal if not their superior. One word of advice: The single disk `hits' albums available are a pale representation of the band and should be rejected in favor of the individual albums of QMS. Honestly, the difference is Huge."
5,One of THE definitive 60's West Coast rock albums,"The seminal album for a group much underrated in today's retrospectives of the era, it does not have the cache of the first Grateful Dead or Country Joe, and yet they do some nice things with their cover of Pride of Man. Undoubtedly, the highlight of the album, though, is The Fool."
2,Great Guitarist Lousy Lyricist,3 good songs but otherwise not worth the time. Also heavy on the religious theme. Is this supposed to be blues or gospel?
4,Better than the first book in the series,"I was disappointed with the first book in the Cadfael series, but there was just barely enough good in the first book to make me give the second a try. It was a good thing I did. One Corpse Too Many is more entertaining, more complex and more surprising than a Morbid Taste for Bones. While it reads more like a nice piece of historical fiction than a ""whodunit"", you will find yourself surprised and anxious to learn what happens next."
3,Mine died after 4 months.,Mine had no trauma to it. I just loved it and got it on a sale...Just last week though it would not power up with the power cord or the battery pack. Make sure you buy the extended warrenty!
2,"Some decent suggestions, but fluff to content ratio is 5:1.","There are some usable guidelines for requirements gathering, though I feel common sense would give you many of them. I think this book is watered down heavily to fill 350 pages; the content could have fit in 50 pages. The book was not thought out."
1,Not for a Student Potter,"To look at the picture on the DVD you would think this was an instructional DVD. Not so. It is a preacher telling us how God made us from clay and I believe that He did just that. I go to Church and I am a religious person and I appreciate the message. However, I think to make people think this is an instructional video was and is wrong. It should state that it is a sermon. I have no problem with the sermon and I will watch it eventually but right now I am interested in learning different pottery techniques. From now on I will read everything I can about what I am purchasing."
4,great reference if you already know basic ASP,"I use this book all the time. In fact, so much that I hardly ever put it back on my bookshelf. It is a great reference for anyone who basically knows ASP but needs to occasionally look up how some part of how ASP works. I was self-taught ASP, and just learned how to do different things as I needed them. This book's biggest strength is that it shows you ASP in the big picture of the object model, which I never really grasped until I got this book.This book is NOT a book on VBScript and is NOT an introduction to programming ASP. If you have even a little ASP experience, this book will serve as a valuable reference to looking up how to do specific tasks, but it won't help you until you at least know basically what you are looking for.This book, and the MSDN VBScript library online, are virtually the only references to ASP that I use."
1,Am I the only one who didn't like the book?,"After so many people said that they liked this book, I decided to read it for myself. After 250 pages the book didn't interest me at all. But I continued to read the story and by the end I was extremely disappointed. I felt no compassion for Trudi and thought her to be selfish and drab, regardless of her insane mother and short body. The character developement left a lot to be desired. I did think that the author had a good sense of seeing the war through a German viewpoint but that most of it got lost between Trudi's life and her stories. How can one possibly find any good in this as a literary work when the author writes such obsurd lines as ""To force their secrets to the surface like water farts and let them rip through the silence."""
3,Stones from the River book,"This book was recommended to me, but after reading about 1/3 of it, I really was not connecting with the characters or story line so I never finished it. It is a bit depressing."
3,ok book,"Stones from the River is a good book but it wasn't great. The setting is in Germany between the world wars. Trudi, the protagonist, is a dwarf girl born in a small German village. The first several chapters drag along, and at points it is hard to keep reading. But as you do continue to read you begin to empathize and really start to root for Trudi even though she shows an edge at times. I felt that most of the characters did not show much growth in the book and because of that it is hard to relate to them and really indulge yourself in the story. From a historical standpoint I found the book very interesting which is why i gave it a higher rating than I would have if it were just a regular novel. If you are someone who enjoys books with historical importance than this is a book for you"
3,Trudi,"The book was good, but a little too graphic in some places. Other than that, I thought it was well written and had a good storyline. Trudi was a character that you could connect too. I felt that it was the saddest part near the end-but I won't give it away."
4,Be prepared for a powerful read...,"I can usually read whatever I choose, but this book touched me so profoundly that I had to put it down. Later I attempted to pick it up again, but had to abort my effort to read Ursula Hegi's ""Stones from the River"". The writing is beautiful, the story is compelling. And, someday it will again come off the shelf."
3,"Long on character, short on plot.","Having attempted once to read this story of a German community, I forced myself to try again. I should have followed my instincts and put the book down. While the character studies were excellent --- Trudy Montag emerges as an almost heroic woman --- the plot was aimless. Nothing ever quite reached maturity: not Trudy, not the various neighbors, not the relationships, not the plot. Virtually every vignette was left hanging and the point of the book --- that everyone has a flaw --- was underscored by the flaws of the book itself. This book cries out for an editor to impose some closure and to give the reader a reason to keep going. The only reason I finished the book was to discover if there was a hidden plot. There wasn't. If a reader has nothing better to do, this book is worth reading. If there is anything else to do, by all means, do it."
3,I couldn't make up my mind...,"Sometimes, I liked this book. Sometimes, I thought it was dreadfully dull. Sometimes, I thought it was rather unbelievable (for example, Trudi wasn't put in a camp). Sometimes, I was touched by Trudi's kind and brave nature in the face of truely horrible circumstances. By the end of the book, I was still undecided. I would conditionally recommend this book."
2,Meghan from CT,"Stones from the River by Usula Heigi focuses on the life of a dwarf in Germany during the Nazi occupation. The author uses Trudi's love of storytelling and small town gossip to weave a story not only of the main characters life, but of all those around her. The begining of the book was slow but as Trudi grew the stories began to pick up. The presence of the Nazi's brings a historical element to the novel. I would recommend this book-but you have to trudge through the slow begining to get to the heart of the story. You ultimately get to see Trudi and all those around her mature into acceptance and understanding."
2,kinda boring,"i'm sorry, but i read the novel STONES FROM THE RIVER and usually my comments are very good from OPRAH'S BOOK CLUB but i have to say that this book to me was pretty boring and lame. i fell asleep the first 10 pages of the book!! the ending was pretty good and it was a good story but it was sloppy and choppy. a dull review form me."
4,A very good novel,"A haunting tale, Stones From the River has the relentless psychological power of The Triumph and the Glory, the plot twists of Grisham at his best, and the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain. It took awhile for me to really get involved in the story but once I did I was rewarded with one of the best reading experiences I have enjoyed in a long, long time."
2,I am finding it hard to keep reading after 1/3 of the book.,This book was suggested for my book discussion group. I have only read 178 pages and I wonder if I can bear to read more. The writing seemed good at first. When I realized Trudi was not even 4 years old when she was so all-knowing that lost me. But I kept on. I now feel it is sooo sloooow. And almost childish in the writing or telling of the story. I do not know if I can keep reading as I feel it has gotten very tedious. Perhaps if the author edited it so that it was half its length the story would move. I am normally a patient reader. If my book discussion group decided to take the book off its list I do not think I would ever pick it up again. I have read Holocaust literature. I feel this book is laboriously getting to the Holocaust. It is making me forget the writing I did like in the book.
2,Not Gunter Grass,"I am not one of the many fans of Ursala Hegi. I have several friends whose judgement and taste I generally respect who like her a lot. Not me. She seems trite, contrived, and obsequious to contemporary trendy themes. But, I have to admit, I've never managed to FINISH one of her books. There is that possibility that she has really strong endings. I wouldn't know."
5,Fantastic!,"This is the first book I've read by Ursula Hegi and I thought it was great. Just like the main character Trudi, I think she has wonderful storytelling skills. I was initially put off by the fact that it is an Oprah Book Club selection, but I'm glad that didn't stop me."
5,Great advice good recipes,Really liked the book - good recipes and easy to follow. Noticed a difference in my skin. All about eating the right foods.
5,Hoffmann's blurry twilight,"A collection of stories devoted to exploring, as did Hoffmann fan Hawthorne years and miles father along, the relationship between appearance and reality, and in particular the blurry twilight world of the in-between. Are they dreams? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe both and neither, something unremittingly 'real' while false. Hoffmann plays with the reader as interpreter, just as his characters must interpret their own realities. When is art (artifice) the only lens through which to view the real? Read Hoffmann and think, dream and experience."
2,So-so,The information is ok but it doesn't beat The Bible. All your answers and prayers can easily be found there. This to me just sounds like someone searching for truth and found some information but did not reach their true destination.
5,Time Patrol is agreat read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Poul Anderson always writes unique books. This was had adventure, believable characters and swiftly moving plot. What more can a Sci Fi fan ask for?"
2,21 days of struggling with errors,"Going through ""Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days"" made me feel like an idiot because so many of the exercises -- even using the packaged code from the disk -- wouldn't work. Then I found the 9 pages of corrections on the errata site. Nine pages of corrections? In a book that targets the ""beginners"" market? O'Reilly's books came through for me. A free downloaded web tutorial on Java is better than this book"
1,If you want to learn JAVA don't do it!!!,"Teach yourself Java in 21 days, HA HA HA!!!! If you can understand all about OOP in 21 days then you don't need this book, you need something from SunSoft Books or O'Reilly. If you don't know a lot about this stuff, or you have been out of programming for a while then you won't learn this in 21 days. Gustavo Munoz."
3,Best Wallenstein Album,"Wallenstein were involved with the Cosmic Music lable/scene in Germany in the early seventies. They as soloists often appeared on FAR BETTER releases such as the amazing Cosmic Jokers. But as a band they were very lame. Jurgen their leader was a pathetic singer and here his vocals are well buried in the mix and cosmic and trippy guitars and keyboards sway over a drugged out symphonic rock. By far their best LP but that doesnt mean too much. Best track ""Cosmic Philly"" often appears on Cosmic Music collections."
5,Great charger; worth the money,"I bought this charger because I lost the dock and cords for the Casio camera I have. The camera I have didn't come with a wall charger, just a dock and cords which was extremely inconvenient and hard to take when I was traveling somewhere. This external wall charger made things so much more simple! Seems like the the battery sits in the charger kind of loose, but it's not big deal seeing how it's plugged in and doesn't go anywhere while charging. Fast enough charge for me. Maybe takes a couple hours for a full charge, which I'm fine with."
3,"The book 's cover was overly worn, and no reply from the seller","The book is used in Communication Systems course with professor Salehi. The professor is great, and so is the book. The book is very clear and descriptive."
3,Make up your own mind,"The philosophy of ""Power Factor Training"" is doing heavy partial reps in X amount of time. Okay? That's it. Some people swear by it. Others swear at it. Make up your own mind. The book is valuable, though, in that it does show which exercises are the most effective for certain areas."
3,Better than folky stuff,"Ochs could have developed into a great country singer if he had lived. This introspective album is probably a bit too weird for most tastes; still, there's some good music here."
5,I love this series,I can't complain about this series. I enjoyed everyone of them several times. My mom even reads them. It is a great concept to have them work together. It would be fun to see a new tv series based on these books.
5,Excellent!!,I read this book months ago. It was the first one I ever read but it is one of the best. In the beginning Nancy and George are on vacation in Amsterdam to visit one of Georges' friends. They meet up with Frank and Joe who are there to investigate a robbery from the 1940's. They are searching for a load of gold bullion stolen by the Nazis. It has lots of unexpected happenings but is VERY good! I reccommend this to anyone who likes mysteries.
3,Good stuff,"This conditioner does work well, and smells really good too. I find it works best if you leave it on for close to 4-5 minutes. It soaks in well, and leaves hair very soft."
2,Not Convinced It's New,"You know, I put this in the shower when it arrived, without really inspecting it first. When I went to use it the next day, I noticed that it wasn't really ""full,"" and the bottle was scuffed up a bit. The pump had already been unlocked, too. So I'm pretty sure it was a used bottle of conditioner. I'd avoid this seller."
1,Original unit failed and replacement unit failed,Purchased the Intellinav ONE back in February. Shortly after using the unit for business travel it continuously locked up and froze. Had to send the unit back to Intellinav for a new unit. The replacement unit failed on my first trip. Now Intellinav nor the company I purchased the unit thru will provide a refund. I spent a lot of time researching and thought I made a good purchase compared to other units on the market. Now I will look to buy a proven and reliable brand.
1,Good except . . . . . . .,"Here is an example of a product that is 99% great, 1% worse than awful and the 1% absolutely ruins it 100%. On the tune, ""Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day"", my first copy had a defect in the first 40 seconds of the song by skipping four times before the first verse was finished. I requested another copy from the vendor and when I got it, it also had the same defect as my first copy! We decided that this was a manufacture's defect and coming from the famous Bear Family company, there shouldn't have been ANY defects sent out for public sale.Why it upsets me so much is because a)you don't expect this kind of shoddy product quality control from Bear Family (b)I bought this cd especially for ""Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day"" and (c)I can't find this song on any other cd release.If one defective song doesn't bother you like it upsetted me, then this is a good buy for the rest of their songs. Still, what happened Bear Family???"
5,Never thought it would happen,"I'm a very private person who keeps my feelings, thoughts, closely within myself. Yeah, I went through a terrible, traumatic experience, but it had been a couple of years and I figured life had gone on and that was just the way things were going to be.I've listened to guided imagery cds before, and never really thought anything other than ""well, the music was pleasant""....until now. Never before have I had a guided imagery cd lead me through such a kaleidescope of raw emotions--there were parts where I was literally shaking, and yes, even crying. By the end of the cd though, I began to feel like a ton had been lifted off of my shoulders, that the tension was relieved, and that I felt a bit of peace. This doubter has been converted...try the cd out, but be ready for some strong feelings."
1,did not work,"This ""Ford Antenna"" does not fit a Ford Focus 2002. Nowhere on this product does it mention the years or models that it works with.Please give more details on what it works with!"
2,Didn't fit,Product didn't fit my vehicle. Description needs to be more specific to year/model of Ford. Ended up cutting one end off and splicing it in as I was not in the mood to send the item back and have to wait for the correct one to be shipped. Already done it way too many times with other products that have been ordered.
5,Fantasy That Is More Vivid Than Life,"I just finished reading the other readers' reviews of this book. I want to add just one more thing. Upon reading the book a second time, I was so involved with the characters that I was actually hoping for a happier ending this time. Of course, no such ending would have been as satisfying as the one Millhauser produced, but my connection with Edwin was so strong that I couldn't help wanting him to triumph."
4,Great book,This book in combination with the book Understanding Probability by Henk Tijms was of great help to me in passing my probability exams in my study of actarial sciences. Highly recommended!
2,Too elementary,"This text published by Actex, is clearly exclusively designed for the audience of students who are preparing for actuarial exam 1 (probability and calculus). It is paperback, and the typesetting is poor compared with other probability texts.This book is okay for a sort of remedial text, but much too easy for the serious actuarial student. This book is not going to provide adequate preparation, so be prepared to select another probability text such as Bean or Ross from the list.Given the level of difficulty of the actuarial exams, the level of this textbook is much too low. Recommended only for those students who cannot take a course in probability and are not successful reading one of the other texts on the course of reading.In short, if this is the right level text for you, the actuarial exam is not at your level."
4,Probability for Risk Management,The book has been very useful and there were no problems in ordering and shipping either.
1,Does not bond effectively,"I'm a craftsman who has worked with adhesives for over 40 years. Typically I use a different brand of contact cement, but it was Sunday and I found I was out of my usual brand, so I ran down and bought some of this. Same project, following the directions precisely, and the glue just will not hold. Well, not entirely true; the pieces will stick together, but not with a strong bond. My other brand simply would not let go, but this DAP will allow you to peel the pieces apart and reposition them, which is not at all what I want. If you only need some adhesion, then this is the product for you; if you want a strong bond go with Barge or another brand."
1,terrible,This is SO small and tight and it is awful. Do NOT purchase this product - you will be disappointed.
5,Frisbee,"My black lab just loves these disks. After a little practice, they really fly. The ""bone"" is an adequate area for her to grab and to chew on when she is playing in the house. A great, relatively durable toy."
4,Excellent for Signed English,"This book is great as a vocabulary builder for new signers. Signs are clearly shown and explained.However, it pushes English grammar and word order, and the number of signs per category can be overwhelming.Not for those who want to learn the ""pure"" form of American Sign Language, grammar and all."
3,The Buzz,"These sunglasses are good. They look cool, and keep the sun out of your eyes. I would reccomend these glasses to anyone in need of some good sunglasses."
3,Check it out at the library,"This book analyzes 10 movies -- their structure, plot points, etc, protagonists, antagonists, etc. It didn't take me long to get through the book because several of the chapters focus on movies I didn't like.Once through the book and I think you'll find all you need. This isn't one that you pick up again and again to get you through the rough spots. Borrow it from your local library, spend a day or two pulling out what you need and then return it. There are many other books that will be more useful to you as references."
4,Great piece of equipment,"The panasonic dvd-lv70 is a great little piece of equipment, lightweight, great picture and sound. The reason I only gave it a 4 is that it only contains one jack for headphones. I thought the description that I read said it had two, which I needed."
5,A terrific look at advanced Long Fist,"A great DVD on the more advanced parts of Long Fist Kung Fu, terrific exercises for martial artists of any style, although you may feel a little silly doing some of them, they will work your legs and additional muscles to an extraordinary degree. At 400 minutes in length, you get amazing amounts of information handed to you at a great price."
2,Musings Geared for Very Small Software Vendors,"Though the book has several good insights in it, I recommend it only for micro-ISVs, small software publishers just getting started.I was looking for a more in-depth analysis. What we have here is a reorganized diary of thoughts from a guy who ran a small software firm. There are no charts, tables, statistics, or other quantitative data. The book is also surprisingly devoid of case studies.One virtue of the book is it has some good analogies that illustrate principles of the business.Still, if your software firm is selling more than $500,000 you're not going to find enough material here to sink your teeth in."
3,Easy enough for a guy,"As a guy who likes to cook once in a while but not worry about getting it right from scratch, I found this book's recipes easy to follow and the results as good as from scratch. No one knew. I was a little disappointed because the first recipe I made, the citrus tart, has a mistake in it (it listed an ingredient but that ingredient wasn't included in the directions!), so it left me wondering about the rest of the recipes' accuracy. But overall a good variety of recipes for any occassion. Beware there are no pictures, just a few drawings."
4,Doggies and biscuits,"The doggies loved these biscuits, however, it did give them a little bowel trouble for several days in a week."
2,Nokia earset from 10 years ago was better.,Nokia earset from 10 years ago was better. The one that used to come with 3650 series (for free).
4,Decent little thing,"I've gone through many different headsets, all of which stop working after a few months of heavy use, presumably through failure of the wiring at one end or the other due to normal stresses. So I decided to buy a few of the little cheap ones, to see if I could at least waste less money and material. This one turned out to be a little gem. Plenty of loudness in your ear, though folks on the other often couldn't hear me well, and I ended up holding the little microphone blob on the cord closer to my mouth. While this is a nuisance, it isn't always necessary, and there's a clip that lets you attach it to you so that the mic is better positioned, and the whole thing is incredibly inexpensive, making it (so far) my favorite among at least a dozen different designs we've tried over the years."
2,Heavy-Handed re-hash of old material,"With this book I expected what the subtitle promises -- ""a lively history of steamboating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.""But there is little or no new material in this book. It consists largely of old accounts, mostly contemporary with the steamboat era. Most of the extracts are long, and even with spelling and punctuation modernized, they're difficult to wade through due to the obtuse language and the amount of commentary not related to steamboats. The library of any really serious student of steamboat history will probably already contain much of the original source material for these lengthy quotations. Mine does.If you seek contemporary ""verbal snapshots"" of a few eccentric individuals who traveled once or twice on steamboats, this book may be for you. For the serious steamboat historian, however, it covers too little new ground to be an important history while, containing too much heavy, archaic language to be an enjoyable read."
1,Not a very good book....,"I wanted to get an idea of what the Icelandic language was like, so I picked up this book. I have found this book to be very confusing.. It does not do an effective job of teaching the language. It's really a book made in 1961 with a new cover and all. It's very small, and not much to learn. But it does give you an idea on how to do some things. This book should've been at least REVISED, if not rewritten."
5,A serious book for learning Icelandic grammar,"This is book is geared towards studying Icelandic grammar and culture, and not necessarily towards learning to speak the language. It was exactly what I was looking for to understand more about the etymological origins of the English language. It's true that if you do not have a firm grasp of grammatical concepts, this book may deter (frighten) you from persuing the learning of this beautiful language."
5,The Best,"I've hard a hard time removing HFCS from my diet and still satisfying my sweet tooth. But these lollipops fit the bill perfectly. They taste amazing. I really like the flavors, even thought I thought I wouldn't. Pomegranate Pucker is my favorite and It thought I'd like it least. I'll be buying these for all the kids I know."
2,Warning: This sh*t smells and tastes nasty,"I've never written an Amazon testimonial before but I have to warn people that the smell and taste of these things is terrible. I take plenty o' vitamins, and this sh*t is nasty. There's no aftertaste, though. Besides that i guess it's fine."
5,Bad smell; but overall great!,"These do smell very bad, and for the first couple of weeks I had very loose stools (only taking 1 tab a day, too) but overall energy and alertness have improved, so yippee! Like very much that they are food based, that was the clincher for me."
2,Ok I guess.,This sheath it came with split open the second I took the sword out of it. The sheath is flimsy and cheap. The sword itself is kinda cool but the handle unravels really easily.
4,"Amazing Sword, Bad Sheath","The sword itself was more amazing than I thought it would be. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. He was very surprised how amazing it was. Two downsides that made me rate it a four; the sword came wrapped in sticky plastic which left a sticky residue on it, and there was tons of powder all over the sheath. Part of the sheath wasn't seamed up all the way either, so if you put it in wrong, it comes out of it."
5,TIMBUK2,Great wallet...sturdy and plenty of room for my needs. The price was right. The name says it all.
5,Retro VHS...,Wow. Fast free delivery. Excellent conditions. Brand new in a box. Met and exceeded expectations. It is refreshing that we still can find new items for our retro VHS project.
3,It was the wrong adapter for me,"I purchased this product, but found out that this product isn't applicable for my tapes, so I can't make a truly accurate assessment, but fortunately it wasn't an expensive investment."
1,KINYO VC600 VHS-C Adapter,"I have three loose pieces that fell out before I could insert my first 8mm tape. However, the compartment for the 8mm tape is narrower than the 8mm tape and hence will not fit. Worthless."
1,A Truly Pathetic WWII Atlas,"When you open an atlas on the Pacific war and there are no references to the attack on Pearl Harbor, you know something is remiss. Be forewarned. The maps only show ground operations. There is no index or table of contents to locate a particular map. You could go through the entire manual and never guess that the Air Force or Navy ever participated in the Pacific theatre. The large sized maps appealed to me and I got suckered in by the 5 star review. This atlas is related to a West Point textbook and is a little use to a World War II buff. Shop elsewhere."
2,nightgown,"For the price, the quality was very poor. I was extremely disappointed and would not buy another or recommend this product to anyone."
1,not for the money,The amount of money paid for the item was far past it's worth. The material was very thin. I expected thick luxurious material as it looked on the advertsiment and instead I received something that could have been purchased at the local kmart. Very disappointing.
3,"sized large, very sheer","sent it back. usually a medium, but it was quite large. could easily be worn late into pregnancy. Also very thin, sheer fabric."
3,A Musical Change,"""Please Don't Ever Change"" which was Brinsley Schwarz's fifth album, is somewhat of a disappointment. After two artistically successful albums, ""Silver Gun""and ""Nervous on the Road"", both were strongly influenced by American country music, this album surprisingly is an almost pure r&b; album.The melodious songs from Nick Lowe, Ian Gomm are virtually absent on this album where as much four tracks are cover versions. Nick Lowe's songs come out almost as ironic pastiches of artists like Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. Most memorable is probably ""Why do we Hurt the One We Love"" which has a surprising reggae-like beat. Reggae music had by this time not really caught on.The by far the strongest track on the album is Ian Gomm's soulfull ""Hooked on Love"" which has a nice drive, and may give associations towards the Grateful Dead at their best. Wisely enough, this song was chosen as the opening number, unfortunately the album grauadually loses steam from there."
3,I watched the entire film for THIS?,"I thoroughly loved this film...I love Tom Wilkinson who gave me a stellar and believable performance rivaled by his role in Michael Clayton and Emily Watson is MILF'y Drop Dead Gorgeous and what a great actress. I'm not going to repeat what others have said both good and bad because I agree...But there was such room for more lies and perpetrations and the final scene left me completely flat...""I love you""...that was it? I waited the entire film for ""I love you""?"
1,Terrible,"Terrible. Let's see, were we supposed to like the expensive furniture, hotel scenery, shoes, and nightgowns? Poor Tom Wilkinson, found himself in the middle of that."
2,Slow And Plodding,"While the plot premise is interesting, a cheating wife protected from criminal exposure by her loyal husband despite the wife refusing to give up her paramour, this movie moved at a snail's pace and the actors seemed uncommitted and cold. The cast was adequate, but direction seemed passionless. It was not an enjoyable movie experience."
2,Not that much fun.,I don't really care for this book. It would have been better if they had seven letter word only games and maybe games to quiz you on two and three letter words....and there isn't much to this book either...so it could have been bigger. Being called a big book is a big stretch.
3,It protects. Wish it did more.,"The case is nice. It protects what it's supposed to, especially the screens, both inside and out. It's made of leather too so that's a plus (it's easy to clean).My complaints are on the hole for the camera-phone and the belt clip. When using the camera phone, the hole on the case doesn't really help; it blocks a significant portion of the view, but there's a way to clear it up (by adjusting the case). The clip doesn't slip off easily so it's kind of hard to take it off and clip back on on anything, but I guess this doesn't matter if you're one to just store your phone inside a purse or backpack.Overall, it's a satisfactory item. It does what it does, with a few minor flaws."
1,geez,"this is really horrible and wouldnt recomend this album to anyone. its cheesy cheap techno with stupid lyrics. Im a huge BTBAM fan and dont understand why this cd was even recorded its that bad. but even if it were good its 9 songs and only 21 minutes long. thats just unacceptable i own ep's that are longer than that.stay far far away from this cd, you'll be glad you did."
2,No summit,"What a disappointment. Things tend to pick up after trudging through several pages but if you intend to climb Cold Mountain, be prepared that you may never reach its peak...or if you do, may not find the view so spectacular after all."
2,Unable to maintain interest,"I was unable to maintain interest enough to finish the book, despite repeated attempts. Perhaps the story about his trek into the battle would have been more interesting."
2,Day to day life during the Civil War must have been boring!,"A friends wife told me to stick with it and I would enjoy this book. ""About halfway throught it gets interesting"" - Wrong. Too much detail about the same things: Inman - hungry. Ada - working. Slow and boring. Nothing happens."
2,"if you have time for petty details, read this book",This book is too drawn out. There are so many details used that you begin to lose the plot. The plot itself though is good and would be enjoyable without the details.
1,Very disappointing - boring - nothing new,"I read a lot of books, all kinds of books, & heard great things about this one. I must honestly say that I almost didn't finish it (a first for me) and I thought it was extremely boring and predictable. The characters were not likable and the novel plodded along at a snail's pace. I'm still trying to figure out why there was so much hype. In my opinion, it's not even worth the 1 star rating."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"Very delicately written, this is a book to be savored. Wonderful details about the country and the people and the romance between Inman and Ada. This is not a book to rush through. The best thing I have read in a long time. Highly recommended for anyone who can appreciate the hardship, toils and beauty of life in the southern mountains during the civil war."
4,One of the best books I ever read,"This book was very exciting, and it was a love story. It was the first love story I ever read and I nearly cried at the end."
1,THE BOOK FROM HELL!!!!!!!,"First thing I would like to say is, that it was a waste of my time in and out of class. The reason it was so bad was that it dragged on and on and on with boring detail. Memo to other english teachers out there don't subject your students with this failure of a book. There was one good point about this book. It was when they encountered this group of North Carolinian hillbilies, I cracked up when I read that chapter. So props to that chapter, but the rest of the book will get no such props from me.So all in all this book should be on the worst sellers list than the best sellers list."
1,"cold ""MOUNTAIN""?","Endless pages wasted on descriptions of flowers, trees, rivers, orchards, roads, sun rise, sun down, sun in the middle of the day... If this is Charles' style, I think it's a lousy one!"
1,I apologize,"Turns out, ...Cold Mountain, the worst book ever. It is not one of the greatest american novels ever, and it will never be. No, Ruby is not one of the ""sweetest gals"" ever, ...! WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT THIS BOOK FROM THE BEGINNING, IT IS BAD, AND WE SHOULD RIGHTLY HATE IT. I hope that any other book we are assigned in the future will not be such trash as this. For some time now, my entire class has grown to, dare I say, loathe this book, and everything it stands for, and anything that stands for it. Granted, its a GREAT book for the old and lonely, but there are some of us that don't particulary enjoy being chained to this poor excuse for a novel. ... In conclusion, do not read this book."
3,Too many words,I read this book for my 11th grade english class. This book had a good plot but to much discription. I easly got distracted with all of the stange comparisons. I would recommend it to people with a lot of time and patience.
2,Not bad but not good.,"It all depends on how u look at it. If u look at it in the stories of Inman it was a great book. All his stories kept u into it, but as for Ada's i don't believe that it has any relevance to the book. All she really did was learn how to work on a farm. What does that have to do w/the whole love story that is supposed to be going on. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone unless your the kind of person that likes a real let down."
2,"As a Student, I did not like this book","I am fifteen years old and I had to choose a Civil War book to write a review on. I chose Cold Mountain, frankly, because my grandmother had read it and she said that it was a good book. Little did I know that this book was so tedious to read. I ended up skipping pages at a time just to get on with the story. The ending was awful and, I am not sure if this is because of my age or what, but I didn't think that the story itself was that great. The description was excellent, but after reading two pages of discription, one tends to get a little tired of it, am I right? Overall, I didn't like this book and now I am stuck writing a review of it."
5,This book is on Elisabeth Sherwin's List of Best Books,"From Elisabeth Sherwin's Printed Matter on the Web site: ""What a fabulous novel. Frazier caught the cadence of speech, the mood, the technology of the Civil War era. He adds to that a love story, which plays a secondary role, and a cast of rough characters inhabiting the hills of North Carolina. Brilliantly done."""
2,A very miserable read.,"I don't know how this book made it to the bestseller list. It was a gift from a well-meaning friend (I live in the area where the story is set), but apart from some pleasing turns of phrase and the minor interest sparked by the story of Ada, Ruby and Ruby's father, this was an unenjoyable slog. Not worth the time and effort."
2,"If you have a choice, don't bother with this book","My summary of this book is ""Don't bother."" The author decided to pass up on common formatting for conversation (you know, that whole quotes around a spoken sentence), which made it visually hard to read. The word choice was rich, but that didn't quite make up for the glacial pace. The theme is basically two sets of characters who are trying to remake themselves outside of the structure of the civil war. They wander from incident to incident, only slowly growing/changing. I plodded through it, kept afloat by one secondary character (Ruby) and the portrait of characters encountered by the wounded soldier as he traveled. But really, after that long slog through the story, I would have appreciated a slightly happier ending."
1,For Those who Have Problems Sleeping,"Boring, tedious, disjointed, contrived, silly---poorly fleshed out characters evoke neither sympathy or empathy. There are much better ""reads"" out there and more salubrious ways to spend your time."
1,Never Again,"This book came to my knowledge through a book club that I have recently joined. My past time is reading and collecting information on the Civil War so I was very excited to begin reading this piece.While the writing was a times beautiful and poetic I found it made for very difficult reading. I enjoy reading because I can escape from reality and reatreat into a new and different world. Cold Mountain did enable me to escape but it was into a deep, dark, depressing world that held no interest for me. Ada's dependent personality grated on my nerves and Innman's nonchalant attitude became tiresome. After struggling to maintain momentum and read the book I was very upset at the ending. I felt I should have been rewarded for completing the long novel and instead I was punished. The bottom line is I would not recommend this book to others."
1,Cold Mountain is Cold,"Walking... Farming... Walking... Farming... Hard to keep up with what's happening between all the walking and farming. The ending was the best part of the book, but still all the walking ruined it. I couldn't stand reading the book, I could barely keep my eyes open. I would never recommend."
2,300 pages to long!,"Cold Mountain is a disappointing read. The characters lacked depth, and the journey description was drab. A recent book just out, Miss Cornett's Courtship, is much better. It's charming, the characters are real, and it's a great love story. Miss Cornett's Courtship is what Cold Mountain should have aspired to be."
2,Tedious and Disappointing,"I struggled to reach the end of this book, stopping several times to pick up more interesting reads. Perhaps this book is historically accurate and the problem is that the period of time in which it is set was, for lack of a better word, tedious, but I did grow tired of the daily and detailed recounting of the hero's difficult journey home. I didn't think he was ever going to be reunited with Ada and after finishing the book, I wish he hadn't been."
2,"TOO DESCRIPTIVE,WITHOUT ENOUGH ACTION","i STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED ALL THE HYPE ABOUT this book! I must have started it 4 times until I decided i was going to read it completely, so I could understand what everybody was talking about. One question: Did Inman die in the end after all he had endured? Maybe this is what really disappointed me. Ironically, I just finished Uncle tom's Cabin by Stowe and really enjoyed it. Would someone please explain what I obviously missed during ""Cold Mountain""? I read constantly and I really missed something in this book according to the popularity on the Best Sellers list! I would appreciate hearing from anyone!!!!"
2,This book did not live up to the hype.,I was disappointed with the story. It was dark and uninteresting. I did not like the way it was written with no quotations so you couldn't seperate when someone was talking. It also had a bad ending. I would never call this book a love story which is what it gets billed as. Save your time. Read something else.
1,I don't get it.,"Well, it certainly won an award and according to numerous reviews on this site that seemed to be justified. But I certainly couldn't get into it. I tried on numerous occasions and in the end I got about half way through it and then finally gave up for good. I could not get used to the authors style of writing at all. The story itself, from what I managed to get out of only reading half the book, was very depressing and not very interesting in the slightest. But to me the way that it was written will stand out in my memory as completely uncaptivating and a style of writing that, personally, I will always endeavour to avoid."
1,Really boring!,"Because some professional reviewers give 'good' reviews to a book doesn't mean that the book is in fact good or interesting. However, the public is often mislead or easily persuaded into purchasing these books because they are often described with such forceful words as 'huge, monumental, out-of-this world'. As far as this book is concerned, it's none of these. If it wasn't given to me, I wouldn't have purchased it. When I can't get involved in the characters and storyline after a few chapters - out it goes! There are too many other good books out there, that don't get the attention simply because they haven't been marketed well, or Oprah hasn't chosen them."
3,Not bad,"Pretty entertaining. Frazier has definitely done his homework - the time and place are evoked quite well. Major are a little shallow; minor ones are much better. It's not diet soda, but it's not fine wine, either. Good vacation read."
1,"poorly written, predictable","OK, so apart from poorly written and predictable, the novel creeps along at snail's pace.However, the slow pace did help me to enjoy the book's period atmosphere, which at times is quite enjoyable (when verbiage doesn't knock you out of suspension of disbelief). At the end I was left feeling frustrated that after all the effort of creating the interesting setting, there had been so little interesting story.A completely unremarkable book which sold a remarkable number of copies."
2,Not for Civil War fans,"Although the male lead character, Inman, is escaping from the harsh realities of the Civil War, it has no Civil War history at all. It is a rather boring story, and Inman leads a rather unrealistic journey home. With gruesome killings at the turn of every page, it makes the reader become disillusioned with the story being told and the writer himself."
1,SIMPLY OVERRATED,"Frasier is a genius with words but that's about it unfortunately. Folks go crazy over this tale because there aren't many good new books around these days. I worked sooo hard getting into the character Inman but it was a failure. He seems strangely one-dimensional while Ada is maybe two-dimensional. And Nature is three-dimentional. Frasier digs nature so much more than his characters that COLD MOUNTAIN should be classified as a ""nature"" book (not fiction)."
5,Wonderful Book,"Cold Mountain has only two flaws: the ending and the fact that it alternates from gorgeous, splendid, magnificent writing to merely gorgeous, splendid writing. It's quite unlike anything I have ever read before, extraordinarily well-researched, lyrical, beautiful, you can touch the snow and taste the coldness of the creek water. I often find myself thinking about it even though it's been three months and nine other books since I read it. My great-grandmother, who lived in the same general area, was 20 years old at the end of the Civil War. Like Ada, she too was educated, came from a well-to-do family and also had to wait until the end of the war before she could be with her betrothed. My great-grandparents' story end differently but but reading Ada's story made me taught me a great deal about what daily life must have been like for my great-grandmother."
4,Contemporary Literary Classic,This book will be required reading for my grandchildren in school. Very well written!Step into the life of a Civil War soldier searching for purpose in life above basic survival. As he journeys home to the woman he loves you'll get a glimpse of the Amercian people who lived in the midst and aftermath of civil war.
1,HATED IT!,"I really hate to be negative about any book and of course I don't want to insult the author, but I found this book incredibly dull. I was barely able to get through the entire book. I mostly skimmed the chapters about Inman waiting for something interesting to happen. The chapters about Ada and Ruby were slightly more readable, but not enough to make the book interesting. None of the characters drew me in. I read this book because I kept hearing how good this book was. I know i'm in the minority but I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone."
2,My Wife's Gift I had to read!,"When my wife gave me the book for Christmas I was thrilled. I had heard so much about it - and #1! But I just finished it - plodded through it - and I thanked her for it but I will donate it to the public library. Maybe someone else will enjoy it. It was depressing and didn't really follow a plot line that I could discover. The words that were written came together nicely at places, but the whole was not complete. Nice descriptions of the mountains in winter. The book was COLD!"
2,Bored With Ada,"First of all, the book was disappointing. I thought that it would be more about the Civil War, but there wasnt much about the battles, just mentioned here and there. Seems like the Author started in the middle of a story.I was very bored most of the time with Ada. I skipped a lot of her discriptions of non interesting plants etc. She seemed to be dumb about everything except looking at birds and weeds and plants. She didnt seem to notice all those years that a war was going on. She seemed blind to so much that was happening.Also, I was very disappointed in the ending of the book. I just couldnt believe it ended that way. Sort of all at once."
1,A lengthy and BORING travelogue.,"When I get to page 60 of a novel and still cannot make heads nor tails of what is happening, something is wrong. This has got to be one of the most over-rated books in modern history. When action scenes require, well, action, what do we get??? Descriptions of the moon for several pages. Give me a break. This is not a Civil War tale, but a lengthy and boring travelogue. And why did the author not use quotation marks to set off dialogue? Some artistic thing?--or was the key on his typewriter broken? Obnoxious and hard to follow."
1,"Too much fanfare, too little on delivery.","Spare me, who cares? This was the biggest waste of time and money I have ever spent. It was chosen by our Book Club and (after all the hype) caused more disappointment than any book I have read in many a year."
2,THE GRASS GROWS SLOWER ON THIS SIDE,"This book has a good story line which could be much better than it is. Fraizer writes a novel with great imagery. Inman's journey across the embattled south is an epic one. However, the book's biggest detractor is the slowness of the plot at times. Some parts of the book are quite entertaining and just wish to be finished whilst others feel laborious to finish. If you are a person who is fascinated with the Civil War Era this book is for you. If you are the kind of person that looks for a book which is full of excitement and is nearly impossible to put down, you will be dissapointed by this one. Its underlying plot is of excellent caliber but it is the slowness of some parts of this book that keep it from being as good as it could potentially be."
2,BORING....WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE?,"THIS could have been a good book, but just could not hold my interest. It was boring for all but maybe 100 pages. If this book was edited down, maybe. A good story line and this would probably make a great movie. There was too much babble, i found it hard to concentrate and enjoy. This book has been winning awards???? I know several people who put it down after 100 pages. It is just not gripping, although it could have been."
2,The best lullaby ever written.,"This book bored me. I would never have finished it, if I didn't have to for class. Anytime I had trouble sleeping read a page and my problem was solved. The first half was dull no attention grabbing anything it was all boring detail. The book finally got a little better at the end. The ending I think was written the best was it could have been."
4,"A book that needs only one chacter, Inman","Cold Mountain had so much potential to be an all-time great book. But the dull attempt at romance seems to hinder every chapter. Charles Frazier could be a great action author, but he needs to stay away from passion. It seemed that every other chapter was good, and those chapters seemed to be without romance. It is that the romance of the story kills the action and heart of the book.To make the book enjoyable, read chapters 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ect... They happen to be all Inman chapters!"
1,Cold Mountain - what a disappointment,"Please consider reading other 'historical fiction' based on the time period of the Civil War before putting this one on your reading list. Yes, you get the idea that the War is going on and that people have been affected by it, but page after page of 'setup' from the time period is just too much for me. There is no real climax to the story and only a brief resolution of what the whole novel is about in the first place. Gone With The Wind felt like a shorter novel."
2,hard to understand but the plot is good.,I haven't finished that yet but from the begin to page #300 it has been difficult but still somehow interesting to read. I don't know where do I find the interests parts but maybe it just takes me into the plot while when I or we in the class are reading that. I would given better grade if they just hadn't put so much details to the story. But anyway that book is not for me.
1,Do yourself a favor and skip this book!,"Cold Mountain started out well and went downhill with the crude descriptions of a sleazy female. If you don't want to read crude and degrading literature, skip this book. The ending stunk as well. I was very disappointed considering the rave reviews it received. If you want to read historical fiction based on the Civil War, try Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels."""
1,Needs an editor,"The descriptions are wonderful but the punctuation -- especially in the dialogue is gastly. I guess he's trying for a Joseph Conrad / Heart of Darkness meets Gone with the Wind. I don't like Conrad's style of writing either. I wanted to mark quotation marks for all the dialogue (I didn't, of course)."
2,My thoughts on Cold Mountain,"I thought the details in this novel were exellent - but over all I didn't really like the novel. The ending seem too rushed ,, nothing like the rest of the novel."
1,A complete waste of my time.,"This book took forever to get to the point. Once, it got there, I was amazed by the excuriating effort it took to get to such a stupid ending. The ending romanticised premarital sex and a child growing up without a father. What a waste!"
3,Hard going,"I started reading this book with a tremendous amount of anticipation. I didn't really get what I was expecting.To start with the actual reading of the book is fairly heavy going. The style of the text, with its arbitrary puctuation, takes some getting used to. Secondly, the story is almost unrelentingly bleak. Fair enough it was a dark time in the world, but even the flashback memories fail to offer any enlightenment to the story.And the ending! Well, I shan't give that away, but it left me very let down.All in all it is an interesting book. The story is worth reading, and it is a fascinating time in history where men and women did amazing things just to survive. But it is not a pleasant story, and reading it is hard work."
1,*****An unending bore; a waste of trees*****,"I was required to read this novel for junior english and found it hard to pick up, easy to put down. For the first fifty pages Frazier kept my attention with his time-specific writing and characterizations. However, by the four-hundredth page, the terrificly slow journey had left me back in the hospital where the book began. Nothing seems to happen in this book. If history is your thing, try this book, but don't expect too much. Cold Mountain is nothing special. If you want a truly good book try _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ or _As I Lay Dying_; leave Frazier for another lifetime."
1,Lost on the first sentance,"This novel could have been a good piece of work, but was so poorly written. I could only stand reading the first couple words without becoming lost. And what was all the hype about? Obviously, people don't know what a good book is."
1,This is a National Book Award Winner?,"I'm halfway through the book and thought it would save time to find out what other people think. I very much like the detail, which is the only interesting aspect of the novel. The plot is trite and fantastic; real-life civil war stories are far more dramatic. It doesn't sound as if it gets any better even from the descriptions of those who like the book. This is probably why I rarely read fiction."
5,A stunningly beautiful novel,"Charles Frazier has managed to--with his first book--create a story that signifies life. Many people claim that this novel is depressing. Maybe to them it is, but it's like Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet', the story may not have a happy ending, but that doesn't mean it isn't beautiful. This is a book that everyone should read. It's masterly plotted, and brilliantly written. The descriptions of the south show a hidden beauty in the (figurative) darkness of the region in that time. One reviewer commented that it always seemed like it was night--exactly!!! Frazier used the dark, cold setting as a literary device on which to place a brilliant love story. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
3,grindingly depressing,"The author is a very gifted writer but I found the story grindingly depressing with endless detailed descriptions of violence, death and destruction."
3,Cool Man!,"I have never encountered a contemporary novel that so descriptively portrays the emotional journey of a tired soldier through the ruins of his homelands. As a Russian, I can fully sympathize with the experience the protagonist encounters."
3,Good but somewhat over-rated!,"I had read two reviews of Cold Mountain before I read the book; both raved about Frazier's use of period and regional language. Upon reading the book, I felt that he tried *too* hard to capture the language. Then I thought that Frazier obviously put a lot of work into his book -- but if it is obvious to an amateur like me, maybe something is wrong. I rated it six because it surely is better than the average trash published today AND because I too long for the Blue Ridge Mountains. I could relate to Inman's longing. It was in my top five books of 1997."
3,The most disappointing novel I've read in years,"I don't know why I had high expectations of this novel... maybe because the cover was simple and the colors appealing. This story was a corncrib fashioned of mahogany: obviously Frazier crafted his prose carefully and did much research before detailing the natural history of the region he describes. But his endless, almost compulsive storytelling leads one to believe that his story will ultimately be worth the trek through far too many ""seamlessly's"" and animals roasted on ""green twigs"" - and such is not the case. The story's ending is worse than disappointing - it is like a cold shove to the reader's sternum, after having been wooed through hundreds of pages of promising prose. I felt a little pissed off today after having finished the book - I coulda had a McCarthy."
2,too modern a sensibility,"Although I liked the evocative descriptions, I never for one minute believed I was listening to the thoughts of 19th century people. Frazier made a tremendous effort to make the characters sound like people from that time, but gave them modern sentiments to express. A disappointment."
5,Cold Mountain,Finally a book which can be classified as true literature. A rare talent and certainly destined to become one of the greats. Charles Frazier's literary gift is a rare phenomenon. Frazier's use of the English language has been elevated to an art form. Only an artisan such as Frazier can keep a reader spellbound with so depressing a subject matter. Unforgettable and possibly to be savored again.
1,Very dull and predictable,"This book was not only plodding in pace but also dreary beyond belief. I didn't care AT ALL about any of the characters, and I doubt I'm the only one who saw what was going to happen to the main character half-way through the book. The only reason I gave it one star is the attention to detail the author gave."
5,Beauty is in the spoken word,The use of the English language rose to new heights in this novel. I have never enjoyed a book as much from the standpoint of the use of similes and metaphores. This is the first time that I considered turning around and reading the book all over again. Definitely in the catagory of Pat Conroy. A true delight and destined to become an American classic.
1,very difficult confusing boring read,I too felt that I had to complete this book and enjoy it because everyone was talking about it. The plot was dull. ( how exciting is an endless sroll thru. the woods? )The author jumped all over the place with no continuity so you were constantly turning back to reread the last few pages because you were convinced that you had missed something. Do yourself a favour take a big pass on this book.
4,Wonderfule novel,"Charles Frazier has written a novel that succeeds on a number of levels. The story itself is interesting; following the Oddysey-esque journey of a man fleeing the Civil War (and the man it turned him into) to recapture his life. We also meet the woman he fell in love with before the war interrupted everyone's lives.But the true success of the novel is the language. It is beautifully written, perfectly capturing the mood the writer is looking for.If you are looking for a book that will briskly while away a few hours, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a beautifully written account of life during the end of the Civil War, buy this book and enjoy."
3,"Good, But Not For Me","Cold Mountain was a very deep, thoughtful novel and I enjoyed it a alot. However, whenever I got to a really good part, some inappropriate dialogue or scene descrption would come up. I think that this is a very good book for an older reader because of all the adult content.As much as I enjoyed following the characters' journey, I did not like all the names that they threw in for no reason; it made the book very confusing. The trips made on Cold Mountain were all very nice, but there were alot of long periods of nothingness, but for the adult,romantic novel reader, I would recommend this book."
1,UNREADABLE AND UNINTERESTING,"I found this book PAINFUL to read. The author's style is incoherent. Unlike some who's reviews I have read, I did not HAVE to read this book. I chose to. What a mistake -- and no one to blame but myself (and the so-called ""critics"" who loved this mess). It's almost as if Charles Frazier intentionally made this book difficult to read. Right down to characters with outrageous names. My only hope for all of mankind is that the author's first novel is also his last. No stars."
4,Overall it was a good book.,"Cold Mountain was a good book except for the description. If there was a lot less description the book would have been excellent. The story line was good and the flashbacks were good but the book went in real time. Inmans journey took forever and the book showed it. Overall, Good Book."
2,It was definitely not my favorite book.,"Cold Mountain had WAY too much detail in it for me. He (Frazier) would go into his details and I would get very lost. Then his little rehashing of the past also threw me off. I noticed that everything the characters said would not be in quotations, and that was confusing also. I'm not sure if I could consider this a book good for teaching in school, because you have to admit, that scene with Junior was very graphic, and not really anything I wanted to read. Also, the scene with Tildy, the big whore. I didn't find any part of the book offensive, but I would understand if someone else did. If this book was made into a movie, it would be about as long as Schindler's List... and that is one very long movie! It needs more action and less BSing around all of the time. I was very disappointed by the ending of the book, and to be quite frank, it pissed me off."
2,Disappointing,"Although I am sure that this novel accurately portrayed Ada and Inman's lives during this Civil War period, I found the character development lacking in that I couldn't muster sympathy for either of the two main characters. The most interesting personalities, in my opinion, were Ruby and her father, and then only marginally interesting. I was disppointed when I reached the end of this book, unfortunately, and felt like my time would have been better spent doing/reading something else."
4,it was good but I hated the ending,"The book Cold Mountain was a very entertaining book. I enjoyed the whole story and I thought that it was very well written, but I hated and despised the ending. It was a sad ending to a sad book. We read this for class, and though most of my class thought that it was a happy ending, I thought that it was sad and depressing. I will admit that the author had, really, no other good way to end the book, I just didn't personally like it. This book was very well written and the themes were easy to see so that the reader understood the whole point of the book. I really enjoyed this book."
2,Highly over-rated and not that great a read.,"I was very disappointed in this novel. After all the hype, I found it uninteresting. I did not become invested in the main characters and was tempted to quit reading it about a halfway through. I was most drawn to Ruby and her determination and inventiveness in drawing a living from the land. That is what kept me reading."
3,"Well, I've read better...","Like another reviewer here, I read CM after having read Underworld. Now, I don't like to compare books by saying that one is ""better"" than the other, but.....Cold Mountain just didn't stay with me. I give Frazier credit for the attempt, but the book reads like weak shot at being ""epic"", and can only be considered great in an era of lowered expectations. I truly hate to give up on a book (I once forced myself to finish a Tom Clancy book even though he writes like an insurance man) but CM was quite a chore. In a year that has given us the sheer story-telling power of An Instance of the Fingerpost, and the haunting brilliance of Underworld, Cold Mountain rates a 'close', but no cigar. I can't say that I would be interested in Frazier's next book"
3,A Masterpiece in Many Ways. Yet...,"Charles Frazier wrote a beautifully touching book, as well as a deeply reflective one about the things war can do to a man's heart. He has weaved a shining tale of the consequences of life lost, and of life completley changed. This book, for it's mortality alone deserved the award it won. It is a beautiful book. But...It is not very interesting. It reads through most of it like a case study of the human mind. We read of Inman's boggled thoughts and feelings. And sometimes. We do not care. This book has just as many dull moments as it does vividly splendid ones. Read this book. But do not expect it to be a roller coaster ride for the mind."
3,"Walking, Farming, Turkeyhunting, and mashed potatoes","Man oh man, how I seriously did not like the beginning of this book. When the ending comes around, that's when the good stuff happens. This descriptive, um, thing, was ever so boring, but the ending was great, but I can't tell you what it is!! Someone told me what it was, and it totally ruined everything. But, if you're one of those people who like descriptive writing and you like falling asleep while reading, please, by all means,READ THIS BOOK!!"
3,Worst ending in the world,"I almost completely hated this book it was to boring, it took two paragraphs just to describe a tree, it was too drug out. I didn't completely hate it though. That's why I gave it three stars. The letters are what kept me in it. I only wanted to see how Ada and Inman ended up, and of course it has to have the worst ending in the whole world. I read the book for Honors English 11 and we read the ending out loud. My teacher ran out of time and it ends all wrong. It should end like a Disney movie Happily ever after, but no it's all wrong. When my teacher finally finished reading it and I wanted to kill myself (not really I was just upset) it had me going the eight plates, and there still together, then Inman and Ada's daughter comes in. I think the drug out discriptions and the ending ruined the book, that's why I gave it a 3."
1,A supremely long drag with little character development.,"The only mildly interesting character in the whole book was maybe Ada, and the highlight of her metamorphosis was when she finally killed two turkeys. Boring, inconsistent, the book reads like a bad rip-off of A Pilgrim's Progress and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The killing of just about every animal in North America, save the wolf and the panther, is richly detailed every two pages. Had I known that this was the ultimate epiphany of the book or the author, I would never have read it. I want my money back!"
1,The audio version is very poor and earned my lowest rating !,"""Cold Mountain"", the book was one of the best I ever read. It likely will become a classic example of the best American literature has to offer. The audio version is too poor to endure to conclusion. It is read in an arrrogant southern speech that approaches monotone and seems never to make an attempt to use changes in voice inflection or tone to differentiate the speakers. It sounds more like a volunteer reading to the elderly or blind in a hospital than a professional presenting a book-on-audio. Mr. Frazier did not do his wonderful book justice by attempting to present it himself. Also, the CD version I purchased from Random House had many technical glitches and minor recording errors."
2,"Anything he can do, she can do better","SPOILER ALERT - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE NOVEL!Not bad - but so politically correct I nearly threw up. All the men (except for the hero) are idiots; all the women are self-sufficient (eventually) and the last thing they need is a man, except for the bare essentials (which is symbolically illustrated in the lovers one-and-only tryst, which spawns a lovely little girl). Your move."
2,This novel is overrated,"This author uses the language anyway he choses. It does not matter to him that he made up some of the words. Also, he uses a lot of negative symbolism toward African Americans being depicted as crows. Not since Walt Disney's Dumbo of the 50's have I seen this. His narrations are too long making this a boring book. Many are being caught up into what this book could have been, no wonder Frazier has failed so many times before this. He cannot write."
2,OH MY GOD!,"This book is an alright book for reading in class but not one I would want to read on my own. It was torcherous and excrusiatingly mind wrenching. I do NOT reccommend this book for the average reader and would never recommend it for anyone younger than an eleventh grader. It's hard to understand and no one in this time period can really relate to it. Other than that the book is fine, I guess."
1,A struggle to read,I agree with one other reader who posted a review here. It was very tedious and without a payoff. I struggled all the way through this book and was disappointed with the story. Hope the movie is better!!!!!
4,A good histoical based romantic drama,"I read a review of this book while my family and I were taking a vacation in Virginia, visiting Civil War battlefields. The history of civil War interests me greatly. The book Cold Mountain interested me because it showed two sides,the soldiers view and the back home view. the story drug a little in places, it took me two months to finish the book, but I am a slow reader and often rereading details. I gave the book to two other friends to read. One of them, a Christain lady said she did not care for the ending. The other lady has not returned the book, she has had it about six months. I like to read histical based novels."
2,Not My Favorite Type of Book,"Cold Mountain was a hard and boring book to read . It always made me sleepy when I read it. The pages went by real slow . It seemed like I read twenty pages , even though I only read five . I couldn't really feel the love between Inman and Ada . This book would be good for people who like to read about the good old days , by people who have a lot of spare time . I did not like the topic of this book . I would give this book two stars out of five."
2,"Cold Mountain left me cold, indeed.",I found this to be the most metronomic book I ever read. Every other chapter was the returning soldier's attempt to get back home; the alternate chapters were the waiting lady's activities.
3,I threw this book against the wall when I finished it!,"Yes, it's beautifully written. Yes, it's compelling and filled with memorable lines and haunting imagery. But what a horrible ending! It upset me so much I regretted ever picking up the book. I realize that a potential classic wouldn't end with ""and they lived happily ever after"" but why were Ada and Inman both thwarted in such stupid and senseless ways? Two fine characters like that deserved better, if not happier, fates."
4,"""The book that's Illustrated without pictures""","Being of the first generation of students to read this book, I think that if it were a fraction harder, it would be too hard. This book was of ideal quality for the average junior. Every story I ever wrote in my life, I was constantly warned, not ""too much"" detail! That's horrible! Too much detail is worse than not enough. Then we go read this book and get told how wonderful it is. Teachers will be hypocrites like that. But hey, as long as you're a famous author, you're allowed to break the rules, right?"
2,How dissappointed was I by this book!,"Okay, I may very well be completely alone in my opinion of this book, but I was vastly let down.Although Charles Frazier manages to collect an interesting tale out of the lives of his ancestors (The only reason this book got more than a star) he tells the stories with such a clinical lack of emotion or depth, that I found myself not giving a damn. After all, he doesn't care about his characters, why should I?Not to mention Frazier's blatant use of little literary tricks (like no quotation marks) for no apparent reason other than it looks cool. I can't believe this is the book (And soon to be movie) that has swept the nation. Try reading Graham Swift if you want real books about the demise of a nation during the 19th century."
2,Snore,Don't be fooled by the literary prizes and movies - this is a boring book. You could just read the first half and not miss anything.
5,Intruiging and Captivating! Wonderfully written,Charles Frazier has wrote a terrific book. It deserves the award it has gotten. Can't wait for his next book.
2,Boring!,I thought I was missing something significant about this book until I read the other reviews. I'm with the people who gave this book one or two stars. Too descriptive and not enough action. This must be a novel for people of higher intellect.
3,I could have been reading a classic,"Cold Mountain is pretty good. It's a great first novel for this Charles Frazier guy. It's a lot better than I or any of my friends could write. Basically, it's OK, but considering that it's going to take you a few days or weeks to read it, why not spend that time reading a much, much better book? You can get as much literary pleasure and nutrition out of 10 pages from either Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian or Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. The similarities of this book to these, along with The Odyssey, reminded me of the goofy fiberglass body work that kids put on their Honda Civics to make them look faster parked in front of the bowling alley. If you want a great book, don't waste your time."
4,Or What you will.,Never before have I enjoyed a Shakespearean ebook in such a manner as using the kindle fire my only quarrel be the style in which it was reproduced
1,Another blank document,"Seriously, just spend the $3 and getTHE COMPLETE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE (Special Kindle Illustrated and Commented Edition) All of William Shakespeare's Unabridged Plays AND Yale Critical Analysis ... (The Complete Works of Shakespeare). I have tried downloading these free versions of Shakespeare over and over and 75%-80% come up as blank documents."
4,summer reading,this is a book on georgias entering tenth grade summer reading list... i have not read twelfth night...but i bought it for free
5,If you like rhythm and blues you will like this.,"One can't not like this album. The only question is just how much you'll love it. This is very up-beat music. Maybe I should just tell you a true story that will indicate my love of Allen Toussaint's music.I first heard ""Whirlaway"" in 1958 while lying in an Army hospital bed, very ill. I wanted that song and it took me 40 years of searching before I found it. Is that liking a song or what? I have it now and out of 27 tracks on this disc there isn't one I don't like.This is ""feel good"" music with a piquant creole flavor that could only have come from New Orleans and a great talent like Allen Toussaint.Thanks Allen, Gary"
5,A brief review on letterheads and business cards,I am a graphic design student studying at Loughborough university and found this book very informative.
4,Very Uplifting,I appreciate the real life experiences used in his story. I love his voice. I listen to this every trip over three hours! Well worth the investment - it will change your life.
2,Success and the Self-Image by Zig Zigar,"I purchased this DVD based on previous highly rated reviews. Unfortunately, for me, the heavy-accented, preach-from-the-pulpit style of presentation irritated me so much that I lost all sense of its content. What little I did absorb might have appealed to audiences of the 70s and 80s era, but his repetive humdrum was not my cup of tea."
2,Not Compatible with Standby,"If you use Standby in Windows XP the card will not be recognized when you resume from Standby. This means that in order for any connected USB devices to work after resuming, you must first pull out the PCMCIA card, reinsert it, and wait for it (and your connected devices) to reload. If you leave your computer on all the time, or if you shut down all the time, this card works great. Dynex free support was completely unhelpful, but they do offer fee-based support for their products to those who don't mind spending more money."
4,A real Pilot,"Very pleased to find this book and the supplier. A man trained for WWI flying combat, the man became an air mail pilot. He then was picked to go to Antarctica. He flew missions there along with Bernt Balchen, a Norwegian who piloted the first plane to fly over the So. Pole. This book backs up, ""Come North with Me"", ""Oceans,Poles, and Airmen"" and the recent ""Atlantic Fever"" by Joe Jackson. That Adm. Richard Byrd was an Egotistical, very self center person, which was my impression when we went on Operation Deep-Freeze together in 1955."
3,Looking forward to her next book,"This is a fun, light, read by a good writer. As the mother of an adopted Chinese girl, I appreciate the glimpses into the main character's struggle with her identity, and laughed out loud during the ongoing discussion about white guys who like to date Asian women (for what it's worth, I think she's dead-on in her appraisal). I'm looking forward to another book."
2,Yuck!,Samael started to suck big time! As their hardcore fan that is all I can say at this moment. Get back (to your roots) or get lost!
3,Memory Lane...,"I loved Space Camp the movie when it first came out. It was mainly filmed in my home town of Huntsville, AL about the same time that I went to Space Camp. At the time, a lot of the stuff you see in the movie really happened at camp (leaving out the poet license and plot devices of course!). What I didn't remember is ALL THE LANGUAGE that's in this movie! My oldest son went to Space Camp for the 1st time this summer (which is even more incredible now than it was then & I worked there in college too). I got the movie (faster than Amazon estimated) after he came back. He invited his best friend to come over and together with the rest of my kids watched this movie. My eyes were about to pop out of my head at all the foul language! Still like the movie but as a parent, really hate the language and would never have bought it for him had a known! I'd prefer to give it 2.5 stars but will round up for nostalgia's sake)."
2,Well.....,"This movie was ok... the plot was too predictable, and unbelieveable. If you like space and SF, you'll like this movie. If you want a GOOD SF movie, watch The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.If you just wanna chat, neomal me at [...]"
5,A Great Family Picture,"I remember when this movie came out. I saw two different reviews of this picture. One liked it and gave the reasons why. The other did not, and gave his reasons why. And the reasons were the same!!! What one reviewer liked the other hated!This is an excellent family picture. It shows how people can step up to meet challenges. Of course, watch this movie with your children. Then, you can use it as a tool to encourage them!One last note: This movie features one of my favorite actors (Skerritt) and one of my favorite actresses (Capshaw)."
1,Poor sensitivity. No support,"This is a great idea, but a poor implementation. I loved shortwave radio as a kid and this is better. I received my unit in December, 2006, and it worked just fine out of the box, but only if I kept it in the same room as my Wi-Fi base station. When I moved it to my bedside, two rooms and three intervening walls away, it stopped. The signal strength indicator dropped to 0-1 bar. BUT--my Sony laptop resting next to it would pick up and stream flawlessly any radio station, showing 4-5 bars of signal strength. It's clear their Wi-Fi circuitry lacks sensitivity, at least compared to my Sony.The seller replaced it with a new unit. It performed the same. An email to the manufacturer went unanswered."
2,Very disappointing,"I have read all of Frank Peretti's books to date. I was excited when this book was released because it had been a few years since Peretti had released a book. Bottom line, this book made me think that possibly it wasn't Christian fiction. I found the plot weak and the book boring. A huge disappointment."
1,A HUGE disappointment,"Wow.........after waiting all this time for a new Peretti book we get this. I find it hard to believe that Frank Peretti wrote this book. I've read everything he's ever written and loved each one. I kept on reading and reading this, waiting expectantly for it to suddenly explode into something profound and wonderful.......something with a plot........something with meaning. This was the biggest waste of time read....if anyone else had written it I would never have plodded all the way through it."
2,Disapointed,"I picked up this book because the author was recommended. Maybe I should have read a differnt book by Mr. Peretti. The begining of the book was interesting and built up a good amount of suspense and mystery. As it went on it became just plain silly. Nothing really scary and the suspense was quickly gone, so it was easy to loose interest. I forced myself to finish it in hopes it would get better, but it got worse. It probably would have made an excellent short story, but the book dragged on alot. I will try one of his other books before giving up. Maybe the next one won't disappoint."
4,This one grows on you,"I will admit that this one immediately had me thinking, 'What is this stuff?' but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. While it does hit evolutionary theory fairly hard, it never quite takes center stage. Peretti does a good job of keeping the plot moving, and throws in enough twists in the end to keep it interesting. I really found it to be much better than I initially thought it would be. A side note, many friends saw what I was reading and many, many of them had read it before and everyone liked it even better than I did. This is a book with a wide audience."
3,Okay. . . .,"This book was okay. It started out excellent, then slowly went downhill, with a few exciting parts at the end.I have read all of Peretti's other works (except House) and enjoyed them all, but I am rather disappointed with this one. Yes, it's a good book. . .but compared to his others, well. . .not so good.Try reading ""The Oath"" by Peretti. It's his best work in my opinion, and its kinda like this one."
4,Enjoyable,"Wow! Although, not his normal style, Monster is a very enjoyable read by Frank Peretti. When I opened the cover, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The surprise is who the actual ""monster"" turns out to be. Although not along the same lines as his ""Darkness"" books, this is a must read for Peretti fans. - Cynthia M. Hickey, author of Pursued By Evil and A Dream Fulfilled."
4,a nice read and unexpected!,"I have read many of Frank Peretti's books and I haven't found one yet that I didn't like. This was one of the first books of his that I read. At first, I wasn't too interested in the topic, but as I read it, I started loving it! Give it a chance because you may be surprised like me."
4,"An engaging, suspenseful read","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought that it had very imaginative subject matter, and I had a hard time of figuring out what was really going on. I couldn't put it down!"
4,Good read!!,"This was an awesome book! I thought it might be like ""The Oath"" but it's nothing like it. A very good read that kept my attention. There were times when the search for Beck got a little long, but towards the end it takes an unexpected twist! You will not be disappointed!"
3,"Quick read, strong suspense","Not quite as strong as Peretti's other works, as some of the other readers have noted. His prose moves smoothly but doesn't stand out in any way. I found this book after I read ""Tales from 2 a.m."" and maybe that colors my view. If you're looking for a fine collection of suspense/horror fiction with a Christian spin and a lot of intriguing angles, check that one out instead.Overall, ""Monster"" is good, just not as good."
3,Good read,"Thought this was going to be a good suspense story and was sort of horrified to discover that it was ""Christian fiction"" in the jacket blurb...but it was actually an interesting and gripping story...the characters were not, other than the main ones, well delineated. But the relationship between Beck and the mutations was touching and well described. And, the so called ""Creationist"" theory wasn't harped upon. But doubt if I will read another from this author."
2,"Disappointed, too!","I was disappointed that this book was more like ""The Oath"" than my favorite Peretti novels ""This Present Darkness"" and ""Piercing the Darkness"". I was very excited, however, to find at the back of the book a comment that Peretti is planning to write a sequel to the ""Darkness"" books. HURRY UP!"
4,Action Packed!,"I had a hard time putting this action packed thriller down. Character development worked well. I'm not sure males are supposed to identify with female characters but I certainly could identify with Reed's wife, Beck.Ray Ruppert, Author of ""The Sovereign Reigns, or Does He?"" ""The Sovereign's Last Battle"" and ""Revelation: A Layperson's Reflections"""
2,Lapsed into something other than a good book,"I put this book down about 300 pages in. There are too many good books available to waste time on one that is not very good. As soon as I noticed it was veering toward christian fundamentalism, I lost interest pretty quickly. It started off well enough, but had so many undeveloped characters as the story unfolded, I just couldn't care very much for them at all. First book I have tried to read by this author - bought it cheap at Costco, so I am out only $13 or thereabouts. Oh, well, on to the next book/author - hope it's better..."
5,What A Rip-Roaring Ride!,"I really enjoyed this book, if I say too much it woud give it away! So read it for yourself!!!"
2,Znat,"I LOVE PERETTI - just not this book. Monster was the first Peretti book I ever read. And needless to say, a long time went by before I decided to read another Peretti book. Thank goodness I gave him another chance. I have become a Peretti fan but have to say this book is my least favorite. Monster is not up to Peretti's style. I found it a wasted read."
4,"Little long, but great book!","I overall enjoyed reading this book. (Especially the ending) But I do think the story could have been shortened a bit. Sometimes I just didn't feel like reading it anymore. Then I would hit a really good part and want to keep reading it! Then I would hit a boring part, etc. But the beginning was good and the ending was good. If you are a big Frank Peretti fan, I recommend it. (even though its not his greatest)"
2,Duh!,"it beats me what all the fuss is about. i own a lot of lee perry, upsetters etc, and i love them all, but this one leaves me cold."
5,Love the sounds,"So different than most Dobro I'm used to hearing, instantly loved the sound. Lots of great tracks, the man can play."
2,Way overpriced!!,I do agree it's a potty training kit but it's actually regular pullups that you buy. You can get the mega pack with 40 in the pack for less than $15 when you use subscribe and save and the other things included you can get pretty cheap at your local grocery store or even at target. The stickers you can pick up at any 99cent store and you can print your own certificate online. Saving you a ton of money. Huggies would do anything to make an extra buck. Save your money and buy the regular pack.
1,Not a worthwhile purchase.,"`The Face' will perhaps convince the ignorant or reinforce the opinions of the already-convinced, but anyone with even a moderate familiarity with the subject of evolution will see through Hanegraaff's points. He trots out old arguments that have long ago been refuted by evolutionary scientists, and, by using ad hominem arguments against his opponents (i.e., personal attacks -- he calls Stephen Jay Gould `pitiful', for instance), he falls into a logical trap that he himself warns his readers against using themselves in discussions with evolutionists."
2,The Good and the Bad,"I purchased this book to learn the basic flaws with the theory of evolution. The acronym FACE is a good reminder of issues that we all need to be aware of.I was disappointed by the extras that I didn't bargin for. For instance, the book is 240 pages long - only 90 pages (38%) of the book focused on the topic evolution. The remainder is focused on - introduction (7%), other issues - (55%), and notes (33%).I did learn a ton from this book. However, I gave it a low rating due to the fact that 62% was not related to the book's purpose - The farce of evolution."
1,This book is itself a farce and a disgrace.,"While browsing in a Christian bookstore recently, I noticed this book's provocative title and was intrigued. I spent some time with it, and found it to be quite as ludicrous as the disappointed reviewer of 10 June 1999 from Portland, Oregon, has described (see below). There's no need for me to repeat that reviewer's detailed critique here, as I agree with each of the points made. This book does not deserve any reading at all, let alone a careful reading.I returned ""Farce"" to the shelf, and moved on to find a book on early Church history. The author whose book I selected seems to know his subject quite well, which is quite a bit more than I can say for the professional debunker Mr. Hanegraaff."
3,bummed,"I just recieved this sneaker, unfortunately I must try to see if I can exchange it because the click closure is broken. :(I tried it on and I will have to tell you this shoe doesn't fit like a sneaker it fits like a dress shoe so order your dress shoe size which in my case is a WIDE which is not available. But I am still going to try to exchange it. It does have a cofortable sole and hope that it will ""break-in"". I had to let the straps all the way out to be able to fit it. I will have to sew the clip strap part because there isn't enough velcro for it to let out enough, that is if I can get a replacement. I paid so little for this shoe I'd be upset if I had to lose the ""deal"". If you have a very wide shoe size don't bother with this shoe."
3,Da Truth: Regardless of what you think!!!,"Look, Any 50 music is good music! I'm a fan of both D-Block and G-Unit, and I'll tell anyone that 50's albums are Hot, Even though, Just like Almost all rappers, His First album will be his best! This soundTrak is ok, I dont think mobb deep and M.O.P. fit the Persona of G-unit! I think that they made my rating for this album go down dramatically!! I relate to 50, I been where he is so i understand his hustle. Doing whatever to eat!! Whether u like it or not he wrote alot for not only the GAME, but All of G-unit's members and he will continue to and everyone will keep buying it jus Cuz u wanna here 50! NOTE: I bootlegged THE GAME's CD, Dreams is the only trak i believe 50 didnt put his 2cents in. U may not like it, and u may argue but u gotta admit it Hate it or Luv it, I speaks da truth!! 1"
2,only 2 to 3 songs worth while,I wasted my money.Better off buying 2 songs separately on the web.....cheaper!
1,JLUV,"Is this garbij, garbojche, or just plain garbage. 50 cent digs his claws into the beats because his production is the only thing sustaining him. He's a wangsta, he stole his identity because he's a day dreamer, aka a gangsta window shopper. He got shot up because he talks too much, not because he's hard. He has nothing to offer to his listeners, but insults. He probably looks at his reflection in his shoes and get hard. Where were you when hip hop died. Is it to early to mourn? Is it too late to rise?"
2,One Last Chance...,"I used to be a huge G-Unit fan, but after the release of the Massacre and Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, I kind of gave up on them. I know I sound like a fair-weather fan and I guess I am, but what it comes down to is the ""realness"" and the ""quality"" of the product. And when a rapper puts out clothes, shoes, vitamin water, and Candy Shop all in a three month span, I don't feel like that rapper is in the game to tell a story or spread the word; I feel like he's trying to make money. In the grand scheme of things, I suppose he's ""hustling,"" but I'm not buying it. Literally, I'm not buying anymore 50 Cent CD's.Dear Fifty Cent:Where did you go? What happened to being humble and proving dominance by rhyming? I miss ""Ghetto QuaRan"". I miss Beg for Mercy. I miss Get Rich or Die Tryin'(The actual CD, not your movie). I miss G-Unit when it was a group of kids hungry on the street. What I really miss is when you were real. If you ever come back... HOLLA AT A PLAYA!-The Truth"
1,Boring.,"Most of these songs are really boring, yet this isn't really my type of music.I decided to give this one a listen, but it's not too good.I prefer his other albums."
1,WICK WICK WANKSTA!!!,"Wow, at this point I'm hoping the movie is better thenthe soundtrack, save your $$$$$..."
4,50 cent can make a good soundtrack,"50 cent can make a good soundtrack. alot of featuing of G-unit family probably only problem i have with this cd.best tracks are What if, I don't know officer,window shopper, you a shooter, and fake love.so I would give this album 4 out of 5."
1,50 Cent Is A Worthless Rapper Period,All of g unit albums will suck because none of these fools can rap and that is the truth. He said he wrote the lyrics for The Game on Games album well if he did that is a miracle because i am not hearing what i heard on the Games album which was pretty damn good and The Game is defiently here to stay. Oh yeah have the gay unit fans heard Games new mixtapes he had some good points about 50 for example snitching on people and trying to take the spot light from The Game and trying to sound tough on the radio and then when Game goes to that radio station 50 does not want to come out to me that is a cowardly. This tells me that 50 is a fake thug and needs to keep his mouth shut.
3,Oh Boy,I knew it would be bad but when I saw the dead cadaver on the slab's chest rising and falling I thought Iknew for sure. However this was a low budget film which was quite good.Movie fans should realise that all films can't cost 20 million to create and that these small indie films can be very well done as this was...I wont review this here as amazon's review already does that but I doubt that u'll be dissappointed you watched this.It's pretty predictable but I recommend it none the less.
3,A decent slasher movie/mystery,"I thought this movie was alright. Trust me I've seen MUCH worse on the same or higher budgets. This was supposed to be done on about a 100,000 budget and for that amount I think the dollar was stretched well and things were done right. I knew who the killer was based on the clue...because I know my Presidents, hehe. Anyway, the cinematography, acting, and plot was good. There was a bit of gore, there was mystery, there were numerous deaths. I guess my only complaint would be that most of the people died in the same fashion. I think I'll pick up the sequel ""The Path of Evil."" I'd say if you're into thriller, mystery slashers pick this one up, it's a good one. One last thing though, I don't think many movies are worth 20.00 so....find it discounted or possibly used if you can, I think $8-$10.00 is fair."
2,Dr. Death's Refreshing Call,"Nothing was humdrum about this movie, yet so much was ""nothing new"" until the not so surprising surprising ending. I figured out the ending about 15 minutes before the ending, yet I was pleasantly surprised. I figured that the young resident junior was guilty, but not his father until the very end. I love these low budget movies as long as the acting is good. There was way to much killing and too much in the same manner. What this movie lacked in budget, it made up for in plot and ending. The acting was well done. You almost knew what would happen to the girls'deputy boyfriend, almost as an act of redemption.Since we have been desensitized to these slasher flicks, it takes somthing outstanding to stand out. This one did not stand out, nor was it outstanding, but it was a pretty good way to spend an hour and a half. I give it a 2.5"
3,Tastes like Koolaid,"This tea is good, but nothing amazing, and kind of odd. I use this tea to make iced tea. I use 4-6 teabags and use a little over a half a cup of sugar in a pitcher to make this and the end result tastes like watered down Koolaid. Not exactly what I wanted or expected. I love Koolaid, but if I want Koolaid, I'll just use the regular kind, not this weird watered down version.In my opinion Raspberry Zinger is MUCH better than Wild berry."
2,"What is ""Zinger?""","I bought this tea and I did not enjoy it. I like this brand a lot but for whatever reason the teas labeled as ""Zinger"" have a strange tart taste to them. They kind of taste like they have artificial sugar added to them. I have no idea what Zinger means and I couldn't find much information on it.I notice a big difference in flavor for the teas that don't say Zinger. I enjoyed the country peach passion and true blueberry from this brand. I would not recommend the Zinger teas."
3,Good but...,"As usual 10cc is in top form. However both the song selection and overall sound and performance fall below 10cc's earlier live album ""Live and Let Live"". I strongly recommend to get that instead of this. Very difficult to find though..."
3,OK Product,The product makes noise when stressed. Next time I will go to a store and the see the product before I buy it.
3,Blue Rabbit,"I am used to children's books that have a moral tale. This book has a very shocking ending. Blue rabbit, the reckless rider, damages the property of the other animals. He then lies and runs away when confronted. He leaves the others animals in the dust. Is it my imagination or do the other animals appear to have hurt feelings? The End. It is a very strange children's book. A good story for emerging socio-paths."
2,Laser went out on mine . . . customer service is HORRIBLE!!!,"nice player for about 3 months then dvd's stopped playing. player was under parts warranty but just out of labor - so brand new laser cost me (for) labor and the part (...) was jvc's responsibility. they've had it now for 2 weeks, and no sign of getting it back soon. their customer support is terrible. i've been transferred and referred to 3 different locations, all of which knew absolutely nothing about the problem. i finally got to a customer service representative manager who is supposedly rushing the player through service. my daughter is about to have a cow since she can't watch her shrek dvd . . .i have no idea about other companies (sony, panasonic, toshiba, etc.) customer support, but i should've waited until outlaw audio releases their dvd player (the best customer service in the business!)"
1,"Mine Stopped Working, too!","While it worked, the player output a decent picture. However, it didn't take long for the unit to fail. It now plays movies for about 30 minutes before it begins to pixellate and finally freeze up. After cooling down, the unit can again play for about 30 minutes. It's pretty useless now and the warranty has expired.I have been a life-long customer of JVC (camcorders, stereos, etc.)... I'll never buy one of their DVD products again. They have produced a golden piece of junk here."
4,Helps a lot for beginners but AI makes big mistakes too..,"Overall, it isnt a bad game. The AI opponents do often call allins with nothing.Also odd is how occasionally a whole table will call ur allin's during a tourney!The odds regarding starting hands-ie Ak beats A6 normally, is fairly good. If you want to learn holdem (only NL in this game) this really helps but it wont help good players much.It's surely worth 20 bucks simply b/c of the fun factor."
5,car part,My husband was very pleased. It was packed great and the company was easy to contact because I needed another part. Enjoyed working with them and will do so in the future
2,I can't really use them,"These turned out to be slightly too long for me to use. I tried using them anyway, but they are really large and heavy. A good weapon should be light and easy to handle, I think. I have had the opportunity to use a really nice pair (after I purchased these) and the difference was obvious, both in versatility and the pain in my hands. However, they do look really nice. Maybe I'll hang them on my wall as decoration."
4,Vesta's comeback CD and an inspired covers' album.,"It's just wonderful to have Vesta bring us some new music--and an inspired covers' album at that!!! Her remakes of ""Whip Appeal"", ""Knocks Me Off My Feet"" and ""Distant Lover"" are all fresh and exciting and it's all too obvious that Vesta still has a lot to offer. Sadly, both the production and overall musicianship/orchestration are lacklustre and merely acceptable at best (a recurring problem on most recent Shanachie R&B releases) but Vesta is an artist with whom it's quite difficult to make a bad album--as such, the pluses far outweigh the minuses. Not perfect but one of 2007's best R&B CDs thus far..."
1,Missing parts twice,"This is a great product, but AMAZON lost parts. First and second kits both missing small bearing and alignment tool. Will order different brand to get good kit."
4,Corrected throwing,"My son,11,had a problem with dropping his elbow when pitching. I've tried many things to correct this(drills,etc) but no luck. I broke down and bought the throwmax.I should of purchased this sooner.He's not 100% cured, but it has improved his throwing and accuracy tremendously. I have him still wear it when we practice throwing.It is not a ""immediate"" cure. A few good days with it on and you will see results.I gave it ""4 stars"" due to the price."
5,Excellent 1st time DVD player,"This was my first DVD player and I love it. Simple to connect and operate. I highly recommend it.Remote control could have glow in the dark buttons, but other than that..no problems."
4,Has been a good choice for me,My SD2700 has always worked fine. My only complaint is that it will not play the DVD+R format (probably because it was built before that was invented?) so I have to go buy DVD-R and rerecord my home movies onto that.
3,you'd better have extremely clean dvds,"It has most of the functions you need for a entry-level dvd player. And it displays quit sharp video with saturate color. Fast and smooth response.But you need very clean dvds. Otherwise, it skips frames and you lose video on the screen. It is also sensitive to some intense copy-right-protection discs, such as Disney discs."
4,Fascinating & Informative,Baseball Almanac ... nearly exclusively refers to this guide as a source to assist others who have questions about the Players Union. Worth it to any baseball fan interested in learning more about the history of the Baseball Players Association and their conflicts with Major League Baseball.
3,ehh...she knows how to work a pole though!,"Way better than the lap dance dvd, at least they are clothed (in some RE-DONK-U-LOUS costumes..NOT HOT!) and definitely teaches you how to move on the floor. Some of the little dances are straight up 80s like the little hop and tap thing that gets you across stage, I am sorry but I won't be caught doing that...I pretty much just fast-fowarded the DVD which is cheaply set up in like a Fetish store so its almost like a home video...learned a little but not enough to buy it again!"
5,Great album,"One of Terry Reid's finest albums with great choice of tracks. A real Terry Reid experience. My favorite, Seed of Memory and To be treated right"
4,Review of Edmonds' and Eidinow's 'Poker',"This pair presents a faithful biography of both Wittgenstein and Popper through the moment where their lives met with the most animation. The prose is thoughtful and thorough. However, as one can imagine, the narrative has its unfortunate breaks and pauses, which hamper the intensity of the episode around which the work is centered. For instance, there are lengthly portions donated to the experience of WWII. This may be relevant for two famous Jewish philosophers, however, it at no point seems central to their argument, which had nothing to do with their Jewish heritage. Insofar as this is, instead, a broad and comparative biography, it succeeds quite reasonable. However, as it is a retelling of the actual argument between the two men, it's a bit of a dud."
2,Kinda whack,"Some scenes are edited off. For example the fight scene between Greco and Carlos. In one scene Greco is talking to Estrella, and the next scene Carlos has a bruise on his face, and so does Greco. You can notice a lot of these mistakes. I guess they couldnt get the license to the Viveme song by Laura Pausini since it is also not on here when the novela first starts.My rating = ** 1/2 starsvery dissapointing"
5,Fun Works: Creating Places Where People Love to Work,"Why do employees in top performing organizations always seem to enjoy their work? In her second book Fun Works: Creating Places Where People Love to Work, Leslie Yerkes lays out 11 principles for creating a Fun/Work Fusion in the workplace. She then examines 11 companies, including Southwest Airlines and Harvard University Dining Services, that have successfully applied these principles to merge fun and work. Leslie offers the keys for unlocking each of the 11 principles for making companies happier and healthier. The book includes a Fun/Work Fusion Inventory of behaviors for measuring the extent to which fun has been allowed to enter any workplace. This easy to read book is loaded with nuggets of information designed to help any organization become a more enjoyable, productive and profitable place to work."
2,out of date,"I expected something more applicable to the present. This book is written for those in the 1930's.While parts of it are interesting, there are better books out there that are more current."
2,"Interesting title, but don't like the author's attitude.","I was almost sure that I would enjoy reading this book, as I am very interested in sustainable agriculture, but the author's attitude is so horrible, it couldn't hold my attention beyond the first few pages...I even tried skipping around to chapters I might be interested in...And I can read some pretty dull stuff, we're talking about books on compost and soil microbes and stuff...those are some of my favorites.Anyways, I also have another book called One Acre and Security, which is highly recommend, it's way better.Take care all.P.S. As an aside, at least I didn't spend a lot for this book. :)"
3,Absolutely Fit,I was nervous when the introduction said you must be fit to do these ab exercises but they were not too difficult for me. I only had to modify twice. I look forward to using this video on a daily basis.
5,"Great product, able to be dimmed.",I use these with some Good Lighting torchieres that were sold at Lowes. I now have two torchieres and always go with the GE brand.
5,Best Dog Toy Ever,"I have a Collie mix, Bailey and this is by far her favorite toy. I first purchased one in the store. It has a good squeak and is very sturdy. It's survived much chewing and many games of fetch. She adores her squeaky fish. I decided to purchase extras in case anything happens. Of all the toys she has, this is her very favorite. It's well constructed and safe for her to play with all day. I would recommend this fish to anyone with a playful dog."
3,Hasn't helped,"A few days after using the face of the fob lost the info. Don't know if the batteries are bad. It does keep track of the amount of cigarettes that you smoke for the day. Too expensive. You can write the number down on a piece of,paper and cut back that way."
1,Bordering on nonsense,I Think the authors know a whole lot of facts about GSM but don't understand how they fit together. So they have written a book that in essence is a random collection of facts. There is no theme to this story.If you are hoping to learn about GSM look elsewhere.
1,Horrible Customer Service & Shipping,I purchased this desk from office depot. It was supposed to be delivered Tuesday between 8-5 it arrived Wednesday at 6:30 PM. When they gave me the unacceptable delivery hours I was told I could call and find out what stop I was on the day of delivery. I could not pick the desk up at the warehouse or in the store. When I called they did not know the name of the shipping company or anything else. I was told I could not have them call ahead. Then I was told all I could do was have the call ahead. All the customer service people we rude and completely unhelpful. In fact one of them hung up on me. As much as I love the desk. I would not purchase another item from office depot.
4,An excellent resource!,"The newest edition of ACSM's guidelines continues to be the gold standard for the professional in sports medicine. The content is research based and fairly easy to interpret and apply. Information is easy to access and the new spiral bound edition is much more user friendly. Overall, I think that ACSM does a great job in providing professionals in the field of sports medicine and exercise physiology with the practical information they need on a daily basis."
1,H02 ERROR,"1.5 years after I bought it, I got the error. The estimation cost is 230 $CAN.I lost my money. I wrote to Panasonic. They should at least give a great rabate to buy a new one. The sound quality is great, but don't never buy that product."
2,Same experience: mine broke after 2 yrs,"The picture quality is excellent for its price class, and I liked the way fast-slow foward/reverse works. However, after 2 yrs mine died. It would not eject the DVD. I would hear a rattling noise from the motor when I powered on the player, but the tray wouldn't budge. I couldn't pull the tray out, it froze in position. I had to open the player to retreive the DVD.My next DVD player will be non-Panasonic. I used to be a huge fan of Panasonic, but not anymore. A DVD player should last at least 5 years."
3,[UPSET],"I PURCHASED THIS DVD PLAYER, DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH EVERYTHING EXCEPT ONE THING. WITHIN ONE MONTH MY SPINDLE MOTOR BROKE AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR ABOUT 4 MONTHS NOW. I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH HOW LONG IT IS TAKING TO FIX THIS SMALL PART.I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW"
5,Kingston,Excellent product and value.Plenty of space for music and pix. HP pavilion read the card with no problems and Windows Media transfered without a hitch.
4,Great tool for Win-mobile development,"The adapters work flawlessly. At my job we develop applications for several different hand-helds which may use any one of the three standard flash memory card sizes. I like the flexibility I have with this set.Additionally the case is perfect for carrying a demo to a customer.There are some problems, however. The first day I had the set, I plugged in the mini adapter into a pda, then tried to insert the trans-flash card into the adapter, I ended up missing, and the 1GB flash drive is still lodged into the device.My only other complaint is that you cannot achieve the Russian Doll effect with this adapter. The full sized card fits the trans-flash, not the mini-flash card. A minor grievance, but something that others would find a positive feature."
3,Good starter,"The video is well done. The instruction and commentary is useful even for someone that has not done this type of thing in the past. Even if you do not have the body of a stripper, there are many good, useful pointers that anyone can use to seduce their man."
2,It's...unique...,"I bought this CD a few months ago. It's okay... mostly. Just as your sitting down to relax and listen to the sounds of the rainforest, you're sent five feet in the air thanks to a horrific yell from some kind of monkey or something. When you think it's finished, the monkey starts again. It seems to yell forever. When it's FINALLY finished, all of the good rainforest noises are over, and you're stuck listening to some rain or a creek or something.This CD is awfull. I now know why there's no picture of it!I give this two stars because it's not so bad if you ignore the monkey, and I had fun watching my cat DESTROY it!"
4,This is not what you may think!,"This album was recorded in early 1971 while both were playing with Miles Davis. Jarrett offered the tapes to Manfred Eicher after he had recorded and released the excellent ""Facing You"". ECM released the album in 1973. It is listed as 2000 because ECM are playing the old game of temporarily deleting lots of titles and then reissuing them at different prices a few months later. Some are cheaper; some are dearer (have you seen the new asking price on ""Tribute""! How do they justify that! ).Back to ""Ruta & Daitya"". This is NOT a standards-type recording. On it Jarrett plays electric piano, organ & flute in addition to piano. De Johnette plays percussion and drums. Ian Carr describes it as being not unlike some of the material on ""Spirits"" which I have not heard at this stage.I like it very much. I just wanted to give you an idea of what to expect as it is nearly thirty years old!"
3,A poor Attempt to be complex,"A sci-fi that isn't worth renting, a good tv movie though, a matrix type movie without a good plot, theme or direction.This movie was very predictable.The only interesting points are what the movie considered to be the future. one of the worst sci-fi movies, yet it was easy to watch, in a time cosuming manor."
4,"Good, but no matrix","The title sums it up,it's a good attempt at what could happen in the not too distant future, but it's not as imaginitive and ground-breaking as The Matrix. The movie does give his patented another view of reallity, but it's what could happen, not another view on what is happening. Like I said it's a good DVD movie, but I wouldn't want to pay $12.00 to see this."
4,pleasant surprise,"I was excited to be getting Johnny Mnemonic, didn't know The Net, was also included. Glad to get two good movies. Enjoyed both movies growing up, so happy to have both in my collection."
3,The brain: the most effective data base!,"After you watch this movie you ask yourself -as I did- what if Terry Gilliam, Ridley Scott, Peter Hyams, John Carpenter or David Cronenberg would have made with this engaging material. This bitter sensation is what you feel at the moment to regard the formidable possibilities of this project.The drama concerns with the cure respect the SAN (a serious warning for the new generations,literally drowned into an ocean of electromagentic waves that surrounds us day after day at exponential rate). So, given this proposal, one should expect a major attempt to undertake an admirable sci fi gem. But...An original plot that promised much more."
3,Johnny Mnemonic Review,"This could have been a much better film if they got a decent actor to play Johnny. Keanu just ain't cuttin it. Any fan of William Gibson's work would appreciate the fact that he wrote the screenplay adaptation from his own short story ""Burning Chrome"". Which is one of the few aspects of this film that make it watchable. Otherwise, the newbie director and the mediocre at best cast (you know you have problems when the two best actors in your movie are Dolph Lungren and Henry Rollins.) ruined what couldhave been quite the ""cyberpunk"" gem. Oh well, Lets hope somebody wises up and does a Neuromancer film. Then maybe us fans can get some retribution."
2,Great intentions... poor execution,The basic storyline is quite interesting but the story itself is less than interesting. The film has potential it just is never realized.
1,heavingly terrible,"I am an FBI agent..(Point Break). Betweeen this pitiful excuse for a film and Point Break, Keanu Reeves as made a name for himself as the worst actor in Hollywood. I feel sorry for anyone else that may be subjected to this crappy flick."
2,"Don't see the movie, buy the book ...","A disappointing treatment of a Cyperpunk classic, Johnny Mnemonic tries too hard and in doing so completely fails to impress. The dark, oppresive atmosphere of William Gibson's future comes across rather well only to be spoiled by blunt and unimaginative acting. The special effect sequences suffer the same fate and come across more like a poor advertisement for the land of tomorrow than an accurate depiction of Gibson's view of the Internet of the future. All in all the movie's a real let down and there's more to be gained by reading Gibson's Cyberpunk novels : Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive and Burning Chrome (the short story collection from which Johnny Mnemonic was taken) END"
2,Prelude to the Matrix,"That's what this film is, the prelude to the Matrix. Johnny is almost campy. Tolerable and sometimes engaging. Henry Rollins actually turns in one of the best performances. Eh, I didn't return the DVD, which is more than I can say for some other films. A little Road Warrior tinge to it as well. Overall, not horrible. I'd have given it two-and-a-half stars if I could have figured out how to enter a half star. -Drew Dixon, 4-11-01"
1,*bluuuurch*,"The only movie I have almost walked out on. And I paid to see Wild Orchid II. What stopped me? Well a guy getting filleted in half with a laser rope. What made me realize that even THAT shouldn't have kept me in the theatre? Mankind's savior is not Ted Theodore Logan, esq. Nope. It is a dolphin. A rubber dolphin. In a fish tank. With a hat on. I wish I could have vomited on command! C'mon people!"
5,Woo hoo,"His comedy is right on, I first saw him on the Comedy channel and then on You Tube. I found myself playing his bits over and over for family and friends. Finally I decided I had to see his whole show, you will not be diappointed."
4,Excellently funny,Pablo was a surprise. His dialects are really excellent and so energetic. I basically LMAO'd. You'll have a great time. 4.5 Stars.
1,False advertising on Yahoo Shopping!!,"I shopped for this particular item through Yahoo shopping. On Yahoo shopping, Amazon has this item listed at $159.00 with FREE SHIPPING. Much to my surprise, when I click on amazon to purchase this item, it is listed at just over $169 with Free shipping, therefore amazon does not have the lowest price on this item. Is this a mistake or false advertising???"
4,A Great Read!,"The Indian Lawyer is a great book for many different reasons. I think the book holds a lot of emotional impact for many different people and you don't have to be a fan of James Welch or Montana Literature to enjoy the book. I recommend anyone who just wants a ""good read"" to read this book- I guarantee you won't be able to put it down!"
1,The Doors? They should be called The Bores,"UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYTHIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE UGLIEST MUSIC I EVER HEARD. THE INSTRUMENTS ARE UGLY AND BAD THE VOCALS ARE UGLY AND BAD THE LYRICS ARE UGLY AND BAD EVEN THE COVERS ARE UGLY AND BAD.NOT GOOD, AS IN BAD!!! BETTER BUY GOOD MUSIC!"
2,Five to One?,"Five to one seems to be the ratio of bad songs to good on this, the Doors third cd. Most of Morrison's best songs had been packed on to the first two cds, The Doors and Strange Days, which are both masterpieces. As compared to what came before, Waiting for the Sun is muddy sounding and unimaginative. Really, the only decent songs are ""Hello, I Love You"" and ""Love Street"". But even these are average. The most interesting song is ""Not to Touch the Earth"" which was taken from a longer song cycle called The Celebration of the Lizard. For some reason only one song of this cycle was recorded on this cd. It can be found in its entirety on The Doors In Concert double cd set which I highly recommend. The inclusion of a studio recording of this work would have pushed the bad songs off and Waiting would have been if not good, then a really good cd. The Doors were yet to sink lower on The Soft Parade. But don't despair, the bounced back on their next one, Morrison Hotel."
1,NOT dishwasher safe or are they????,"The lable on the front safe dishawasher safe, but when you open the package and look on the back side of the exact same lable it says they are NOT dishwasher safe. what gives? nice looking set of pans though. guess they will end up in the camping box."
2,not great,These are normal cheap skillets. Don't waste your money on them. The coating comes off and the metal warps.
4,Better than scorching beauty,"This album isn't really that bad, except for the sappy across the milky way. Again the weak point is Brann's vocals.Don't pay $39.98 for it though."
5,"All we ever were, just zeroes and ones...","I havent even listened to NiN before and after listening to this cd, I'm hooked. The lyrics are extremely deep and meaningful, and if you are or not a NiN fan, pick this cd up, you will love it. I have listened to all of this cd on repeat for 4 days and I cant get enough of it. After reading a little about Trent Reznor and comparing this cd to his others, this is definitely his best at the moment.Pick this up, you wont regret it."
1,Emotionless,"The problem with never studying any of the instruments you're mimiking on processors is the resemblance here on this album. Everything is pushed together, almost to an irritating cyclicing, over-dramatization. Music needs emotion in order to do anything at all."
5,A Top NIN Release!!!,"This is (in my opinion) is one of the best CD's since 'Pretty Hate Machine'. Not having to wait several years between CD's is great!! There was only a 2 year gap between 2005's 'With Teeth' and 'Year Zero' 2007 and nothing about this current release is rushed or hurried by any means. While 'With Teeth' had more of a live feel, 'Year Zero' takes us back to Trent Reznors trademark sound and the root of Nine Inch Nails with the Industrial sound that they are so well known for. While this CD is very Industrial sounding it also is very loud with a lot of guitar. Trents vocals are great!The concept of the album is great as well. Having a very futuristic feel/vibe/meaning to it. Basically when the world hits its breaking point and all things come crashing down. Hitting such topics as greed, power, politics, war with Trents (at times) whispery voice that then turns into the full blown scream. GENIUS! Every song on here stands out.This CD is a must. One of the best!!!!!"
2,What Happend?,"I can't believe this is a NIN album. I ended up liking one song off the whole album. I had high hopes for this album but maybe Trent should have chosen a different route. The overall base of the album is kind of silly in my opinion. I ended up throwing the album after listening to it. I have no idea where it is and don't even care. I hope this isn't what the future has in store for us with other albums, because that is what looks bleak."
4,Reznor's concept album,"I haven't gotten hugely into the story and 20+ websites secretly linked to the album, but this is a good album. A bit of electronic jamming too! It doesn't hurt, too, that the cd changes from black to white when heated."
4,Interesting New Mix,"Trent once again mixes things up with Year Zero. A solid effort, but it may take a few listens before you can get into it. Trent comes across (in my opinion) as an artist more than a musician. His work is nothing short of Genius! This album may not be for the new NIN fan, but I would still recommend it. It remindes me of a mix between The Downward Spiral and With Teeth. Very thought provoking."
2,A Dastardly Mistake? Right?,"I'm going to make this short, and true to the point in context. This album, is a flunk. Trent Reznor's tribute to himself on his own album. I have never heard the combination of I and God in the same sentence on any other album than a Creed multi-platinum hit.... and that is not a complementation to him at all. The lyrics of this album are at an all time dull low. About the only thing salvageable from this album has to be the instrumentals. If they kicked Reznor out of this CD, then it would be quite a piece, but yet he sing on...and on....and on. 2/5 because I appreciate ONLY the instrumentals."
3,It could be better...,"It's a good album, but it's far from being the best thing done by Trent Reznor."
3,Concept album at its best,"If you're a fan of NIN, concept albums, or post-apocalyptic dystopia, then this CD is for you. The music is great, closer to older NIN than recent more rock-like releases, but still accessible for those who don't want to hear just a wall of distortion and noise. The cd packaging is half of the fun, since it fully embraces the sci-fi concept and has great art and design.Buy the CD. Unlike so many current albums, there is actually a value to buying the physical CD instead of just downloading the single online. An excellent addition to any collection."
1,absolute garbage,There are no melodies or solid guitar riffs in any of the songs on this album. Heaviness is not to be found either - everything is a soft drone of mostly random noise.
4,Better than With Teeth and The Fragile.,"This is the best NIN since The Downward Spiral. The dark, in your face themes of TDS are not evident any more, but this cd has lots of variety in song types. Some are more like metal, others are heavy with synth beats and are groove-driven, still others showcase the softer side of Trent Reznor. All in all, this was what I was looking for from NIN for quite some time. I'm glad that the next one should be out sometime next year too. 4.5/5 stars."
2,"Boring, empty...","I've never been a fan of NIN, and this album just raises my dislike for Trent. This album is boring, repetitive, empty, and musically lacking.Trent should stop focusing on a fictional message and start focusing on making good music with depth and originality. Repeated distortions and one-note synth presses aren't going to cut it for me. In order for Trent to get my attention, he's going to have to pull something really, really great out of his hat for me for his next album.For now, I find NIN still repetitive and uninteresting. Not impressed at all."
4,Another very good album,"Nine inch nails have awesome albums as this one. The production is for another time excellent and you can hear industrial music with the correct depth in sound. The tracks gives you a cool <> feeling. This album reminds me The fragile a little bit. The vocals are really great (I love the tone , pitch and the color of his voice) . If you are familiar with Nine inch nails you will probably like this album . Its not a masterpiece but a good one."
3,What year is this?!,"Let me start off by stating that Trent Reznor will always be an artistic genius. He has managed to stay wholly original while still sounding like Nine Inch Nails. With that being said, I feel that Nine Inch Nails has gone in a direction that I cannot follow. Also, when listening to this album, I feel as if I should be living in a futuristic, white pod-house...I would actually give it a 2.5 if I could..."
5,Nine Inch Nails,this is another great cd from nice inch nails. its so awsome. it has many great songs
3,Fantastic but not as heavy,"The title sez it all. A well constructed album. Very hard to read the lyrics (weird txt against black background), but it's fairly easy to understand the message of this conceptual album.Track 2 and 3 (survilalism) are hard hitting while most of the other tracks are not as heavy as his usual work.If you want a heavy metal album then buy with teeth, otherwise for something different have a listen to year zero.Lots of underlying sounds and tweaks so the net samples won't give a very clear indication of the sound.Keep up the good work Trent."
1,Hardly bearable.,"This book was a real disappointment. It is not badly written. It is just boring. Seriously, who cares about heroes who seem to be 12 (years old but it would also work for their IQ score)? Here festiness rimes with brash stupidity, egotism and unbelievable characters . To add worst to bad, the author felt obliged to re-introduced a character from a previous bookwho only speaks by quotations. Arghhh..."
3,The Lottery Rose,"I thought ""The Lottery Rose"" was an ok book. The things that happen in this book are realistic. Georgie, the main character, does not get along with most other people. Nobody likes him, except the librarian at his school. That is a conflict of man versus society. Georgie's step-dad beats him, and his mother doesn't do anything about it. This is also a conflict. This conflict is man versus man. The police find out about what goes on at home, and Georgie gets sent off to a private school. That solved his man versus man conflict. His man versus society conflict is also solved. It takes awhile, but Georgie eventually gets along with everyone. A lot of little things happen that make it a pretty good story. But overall, it's not that bad."
1,"A very boring, yet depressing story","I didn't like this book much. I know a friend who got abused in the past and she had to read it as a class with me and she didn't like to read it because it had happened to her in the past. It was very depressing though and it wouldn't be a very good book to read of you rae in a bad mood.Although I thought it wasn't very good, it was very interesting in the begginning than it got ""boring"" with no detail. Also, in the first couple chapters, the sentences were very long, but there was good descriptive detail in the begginning though.The detail escaped towards the end."
5,Long lasting,"My pit bull destroys toys in hours, but this one was an easy favorite that lasted a good four month in tact. He's since taken the legs and the head off but still loves to play with the body."
2,Edge too soft for my uses,"Admittedly, I'm looking for something possibly unattainable: a silicon spoon that performs as well as a flat-edged wood spoon. If you're looking for a flat-edged spoon for, say, custard, this would do fine. When it comes to breaking up ground beef, its edge is simply too pliant."
4,Good intro to Samba and Bossa...,"Besides the inviting cocktail sipping colorful packaging, these tracks will take you on an eclectic journey through samba and bossa nova. This generous disc will leave you wanting for more!Some of the selections are orchestrated or are done in combos, duets, etc. Nearly all are memorable and set the tone for relaxtion. You can see on the track listing theres' virtually a ""who's who"" from Musica Popular Brasileira represented. To some, this could be the only album of this genre that they would care to own. Just a couple of the selections may be just a little too folksy to me, hence my reservation of a 5th star."
4,Made into TV movie miniseries in the 1980's,I wonder whether the miniseries will be converted to DVD?I will be the first one to buy the DVD.
4,Missouri is MOgnificent,"The calendar is nice, features regional pictures from all throughout the state. The pictures in the calendar are reflective of the seasons. It showcases the natural beauty of Missouri."
2,Still On It....,"Ashanti has many hits in the music industry so it was just a matter of time before a remix album would come out. Although short, mirroring her career thus far, only ten tracks ( and only 6 of those are true remixes) the album is good for those who don't already have these songs somewhere else. It's missing some crucial remixes though like the Happy remix, The Pledge remix as well as a few others. There are also four new songs (to my knowledge). Of these new songs the best one by far is Still On It ( the single) feat. Paul Wall & Method Man. That song is a banger with both Paul Wall & Method Man gettin busy on the mic. The other three songs are cool as well but I seem to be feeling Found It In You the most. Overall, the album is a bit underwhelming simply because it feels rushed and there isn't enough remixes on the album. Unless you are a die hard fan you can pass on this one. 2.5 stars"
3,Does the job...,"I was disappointed when the product arrived and only one can cover was inside. I assumed by the image I was getting two covers - one orange and one yellow - but I only got the orange one. Had I known or realized this, I would have purchased from another vendor. So basically, I paid $6 for one lid. Boo. I was also frustrated that the lid was covered in stickers with glue that DOES NOT WANT TO COME OFF! I've tried to removed the sticky goop, but now I have to go buy goo-gone to get all the crap off. I don't feel like this lid fits as good as the lid I had previously. It works and gets the job done, but I don't think it's keep the food super fresh. Oh well, lesson learned."
2,Does not fit Soulistic Small Cans,"It says it fits the Soulistic small cans but it doesn't, I wasted my money on this lid. There is nothing else I can say about this lid."
1,Worthless product,"I paid an outrageous price ($1.49) for this product at a pet store. It is made far too rigidly to work on the smallest size cans. Once it is on the can, it is impossible for me to remove. I enlisted my husband's help and even he has trouble getting it off. I was given a FREE can cover at another pet store. It is a softer plastic and works much better. If you use the smallest size cans, forget about this one!"
4,Joe Walsh Beginnings,The hit band that started Joe Walsh on a great career prior to the Eagles. Well worth the price of the album.
4,james gang,Can't play the second or first song. There seems to be a scratch or something affecting the play of the cd.
4,The 1st book you should read about Contracting!!,"Having had several months of government contracting experience prior to reading, I found that this book covers its bases very well, explains all necessary concepts clearly (elaborating where necessary and with precise examples), and solidifies the structural framework of how contracting works. I would definitely not group this book with the ""--- for Dummies"" books, which are often vague and leave you lingering with questions. Written from the ground up; great as a fundamentals book for the seasoned contractor or as a starting block for those considering/beginning in the field. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,Amazing companion to The Slider,"If you love ""The Slider"" as many do, you owe it to yourself to pick up this little gem. All of the tracks are unfinished, or demo versions, of each track on ""The Slider."" Highlights include the smoother Metal Guru (sans yelling/backing vocals,) the completely different Buick Mackane, and the super romantic acoustic version of Cadilac. A great revisit to a classic album."
4,i was just a kid,"yeah, i was just a kid and i only had about three or four dollars so i was looking through the bargain bin at the record store and there was nobody in there that i'd ever heard of except john phillips who i knew from the mamas and papas and since it was the only album i could afford i bought it, took it home, added it to my small record collection, played it over and over and learned all the words and sang along and, yes, it DOES grow on you and it isn't the disaster of a record that the critics would have you believe, because it's a GOOD album, just not a GREAT album, and it probably sounds a little dated NOW, but if you were alive and listening to music BACK IN THE DAY, well you just might want to get it, but good luck finding it anywhere NOW for three bucks."
2,Could have been a lot better,"1. I'm not an expert into the actual historical events that took place but via the various reviews on this movie, this movie is another in a long list of Hollywood movies in which the ""based on a true story"" idea is extended beyond reality.2. With the above being said, I can accept the semi-fictional account and just sit down for a good movie, but the problem with this film is that it's just not that good of a movie in the first place. Ultimately, Harrison Ford's portrayal of the Capt of the sub is just lousy and unconvincing.3. Anyway, it's decent enough to rent, but nothing beyond that. For a good sub movie that actually written and acted well--> go for the classic Hunt for Red Oct."
1,failed to capture the theme,"the film is not good. the director says in dvd feature, that the sacrifice of the sailors who prevented the meltdown of nuclear reactor were the heros and saved actually the world. so, we don't see it in the movie. it's very boring with all kinds of already seen images and sequences of sub-marine-movies. harrison ford produced and has a leading role. this is another factor which destroyed the oppurtunity to tell a good story. the story becomes to an ego fight between the captains (actors) etc. Yes he needs a comeback and has to destroy the true theme of the story. sacrifice of the regular men who died. we don't see no real emphasis with those men, where they came from, their women and how was the life under this system. too much? no they just shouldn't focused on every screw of the sub but on the life of those sailors."
2,1 thing kept me from watching this,why would russians speak in broken english?????that alone ruined it for me.
2,Ambitious but lacking in depth,"The film is based on a story that actually took place during the Cold War in the early 1960s. The acting is uneven, and we don't fully understand how the situation in the submarine could possibly have an impact on Soviet-USA relations. We wonder what motivates these soviet soldiers to risk death, they just do it."
4,Just a remark,"Great movie, some already said everything I wanted to say, so I'll refraing from making my own review. I'd like to add only one comment. Somebody here compared this movie with ""Hunt for Red October"". How heartless (or dumb) you could be after that!?Can you understand that this movie is all about a real tragedy, man's deaths and so on!? While movies about 007 are entertaining fairy tails... I have no words to describe what felt reading that review. Where's this world going when people can't tell a real pain from fiction!?I'd like to suggest people to read the original novel which underlied this movie and remember one more time heroes and victims of those times when people died for nothing in the middle of nowhere."
4,Fast moving fun formula,"This is another caught in a leaky sub movie. You just have to enjoy this type of movie to watch it. No new revelations. Harrison Ford gets to play the misunderstood heavy Capt. Alexei Vostrikov; we have to remember he is a good actor and play on both sides of the fence. Harrison Ford is also the executive producer. If you have the heavy then you have to have the father figure played by Liam Neeson as Capt. Mikhail Polenin.People like to compare this movie to other recent submarine movies but the formula was played out long ago in ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958) with Clark Gable as Cmdr. 'Rich' Richardson and Burt Lancaster as Lt. Jim Bledsoe. They had similar command and loyalty conflicts."
3,"Good Film, Good Story but...","Lacks a good structured plot. Also there were some unaccurate things aboutlife on a Russian Sub. All in all, a great idea for a movie, and a good way to show the heroic acts by the sailors on K-19."
3,"HAN SOLO, MEET QUIGON-GINN","The movie is better if you don't know how it ends, so I'll not tell you. This is an interesting movie about a ""true"" incident."
4,A tear jerker if you have a sister!,"In Her Shoes has taken an honorary spot on my ""All Time Favorite Chick Flick"" shelf since the first time I saw it. The characters are wonderful, and the actresses chosen well to fill the spots. The story itself is great and kept me entertained the whole way through... ending up with a heartwarming smile at the end."
2,"Amazon has as ""Kids & Family"" recommendation?!?","Amazon placed this on my recommendations list as ""Kids & Family"". Umm....I don't think so! unless Amazon recommends people to let their kids watch movies with sex scenes and adult language and situations. I watched the movie and guess it has a message, but I don't think my kid/s will be watching this until they are mature enough to handle the sex scenes!"
2,Rather be In Her Pants,"Cameron Diaz is a Man's chick. She is the type of lady who you love to hang out with you and the boyz. The chick who makes you feel good to be a man.However this movie didn't make me feel good to be a man, despite Cameron's sexy body slamming around the movie the whole time. I didn't finish watching this movie. In fact, I didn't watch more than 5 minutes. This was a chick flick, and it was a mistake to even rent it.I wouldn't recommend renting or buying this DVD.MC White said: Not good, but Cameron's bangin' body almost makes it worth it!"
2,Digital analog mess,"Device works well with one FATAL flaw...while a single digital CDR of uncopyrighted material can be made from an external source (DAT via digital optical cable in my case), you can only make ANALOG copies of that CDR even though it came from an uncopyrighted external source. Now searching for a machine that will protect legitimate copyright holders but not constrain my uncopyrighted personal use recording."
4,Rubber Lid concerns,"I love everything about this mug. i use it to store ans reheat soups for lunch at work. My concern is the vented lid. It aborbs stains very easily and has a VERY strong ""pastic chemical"" smell to it. I can't find out what this is made of but I question if it is safe to be in contact with foodstuff, especially heated foods."
3,Not the best but better than a plain cup,"This is a great idea, but the cups need more work. The lid can be difficult to remove. The cups don't retain heat well. My solution has been to heat the soup on the stove and then pour it into the cup, which, I suppose, kind of defeats part of the purpose of convenience. They are easy to clean and don't stain."
3,HOT ONE,"Ordered 2 of these to test them before gifting.I do not recommend microwaving these as they are as hot if not hotter than the water.Handle is cooler but watch your finger.Works great w/Bunn coffee maker,cools it just enough to drink right away.Have not cooked with it yet or tried the steam-release lid but I know it will be hot and stay hot."
1,Not a 20 oz mug,The mug holds only 16 oz not 20 oz as advertised (20 oz is also indicated on the bottom of the cup and the paper label). This is false advertisement.
3,"GOOD MUG, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CHARLES ATLAS TO TAKE OFF TOP","GOOD MUG, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CHARLES ATLAS TO TAKE OFF THE TOP ESPECIALLY IF IT'S BEEN IN THE FRIDGE.NEED HELP WITH IT, NOT FOR THE DISABLEDMAYBE SOME OIL AROUND THE LIP WILL HELP, HAVEN'T. TRIED YETWOULD RATE IT A 5 OTHERWISE"
5,Perfect for a can of soup!,I bought this for heating cans of soup in the microwave and it is perfect. Just big enough for a ten ounce can and half a can of water. Cleans easier than plastic and the handle makes it easier to hold hot soup at my desk at work.
3,Great until the tops crater...,"I've had four of these for several years, and they were my favorite for microwaving frozen veggies...But all things must come to an end, and ALL the tops have cratered... The plastic gets brittle, and break.If they would offer replacement lids for a buck a piece, I would give them a rave review..."
5,Perfect Mug w/Lid @ $5.89,"These mugs are pretty and simple. Yes, the mug is made in China but it is well made. You get what you pay for and this mug is not discount-store quality. The lid is made in the USA and it is truly a must when making oatmeal or reheating soup or beans. It is supposed to hold 20 ounces but I wouldn't go over 16 ounces, specially when microwaving. The size is perfect for handling one serving. It has a 4-inch diameter at the base and is about 4 inches high with the lid on.I purchased mine a couple of days ago at Target, paid $5.89. Amazon was selling them for the same price but all of the sudden the price doubled to almost $12.00 If the price is right for you when reading this review, go ahead an give it a try. :)"
4,Great for Lunch at the Office,"This mug is the perfect size for warming up soup or leftovers for lunch. The only con is the rubber top. After only a month, it is already becoming stained from tomato dishes. Would like it better with a CorningWare lid designed with a steam vent."
4,Great Mug!!,Really like the mug ! But--not the lid . It doesn't fit at all. You could hammer it on.Then you'd need pliers to remove it.
2,Beautiful unit if you don't care about sound...,"Read the reviews about bad sound, but decided to give the unit a try anyway. Mistake! Tried it out right away and, sure enough, the sound was just no good. But, I did take a recommendation from a review and buy a Boostaroo (which I will use on the unit I did buy). Bought an Audiovox 1680 (tried the Audiovox D1700 but it skipped terribly) and I LOVE IT. It's a little heavier, but really works well. Even the picture did not seem as great as some of the reviews said it was. It IS a beautiful, lightweight unit, but that's not a good enought reason to buy this unit."
3,"Excellent ergonomics, so-so display","The Toshiba SD-P1500 is one of the best styled portable DVD players I've seen. The controls are easy to use, except for the fact that you have to tunnel into menus to access fast-forward and rewind controls. The display is very large, at 8 inches. In addition it has an excellent contrast ratio and black level. However one disappointment is the number of pixels: barely just over 100,000. For a unit of this price I would have expected closer to 300,000 pixels. The result of so few pixels? A rather large amount of moire patterns are visible."
4,Left me wanting more ...,"I didn't want the story to end. Of course I didn't want Bliss to stay in Jamaica. There is far too much abuse there for being gay. They could have moved to America and lived life. Hell, the girlfriend could have made a ton of money in the States with her job field and I know in DC, with all the schools, plenty of money to be given.Anyhow... great read... sorry if I spoiled it for anyone, but I didn't want it to end."
5,"Solid, Sharp and Well Made","I like that the knife is small enough to fit in the change pocket of my jeans so I always have a blade with me when I work. Smith & Wesson may only license their name, but I was more than satisfied with the quality and feel of this nice little knife. I highly recommend this and will buy more as stocking stuffers."
2,Dull,"I wish I had done some more research on Smith & Wesson knives before purchasing this. According to the information I could find, the Smith & Wesson name is simply licensed to a knife manufacturer that has fairly poor quality control over their blades. The one I got was junk, right out of the box -- this knife couldn't cut through air. Check out some other small-knife options like theKershaw Little Lockback Folding Pocket Knife (Blue)before going with the Little Pal."
2,Just Extra Trash Included! Not Worth Extra $$$,Just buy the pull-ups. Forget this so called kit. It's not a kit at all. Just a bunch of papers we had to throw away and a few stickers.
5,Amazing!!!,"I bought mine about a week ago, and let me tell ya, this amp is all that I'll need for years to come. I don't see a reason to even need another amp. It's so clean. I play I'm an experimental band, so we play a variety of styles. This amp definitely has versatility. Also, it doesn't take up a bunch of space like my stack does. You won't be disappointed buying this product. Related artists (Dance Gavin Dance, The Dear Hunter, Maybeshewill, Circa Survive, This Town Needs Guns, The Mars Volta and so on)"
5,Perfect cookbook for entertaining,"I have 2 cookbooks by Annabel Langbein (the other one is ""Savour of the Pacific: a discovery of taste"") and both belong to my favourites. This is a very good book for the amateur cook who would like to make unforgettable but doable meals. Langbein's no-nonsense approach really helps here: the recipes are creative and delicious yet easy to make. There is also a section with proposed menus that describe very well what you can make when ahead. The recipes are very varied in style, there should always be some that correspond to your mood. Of note are Annabel's excellent salad dressings."
2,Slow shipping and lousy workmanship,"Waited almost a month for delivery when it was supposed to be ""in stock"". When the timer arrived the back over the batteries will not stay on, have to tape it shut. Too much trouble to send the darn thing back. Works really well as a vibrating timer for a hard of hearing person like myself once you tape it together with Gorilla Tape. Can't hear the beeper at all."
4,"Good Prize, Good Product, not so good customer services","I am happy with the product, not so happy with seller's services, when I had a question I didn't get good response..."
3,I have no idea,"This movie is really...well, strange. Not to say it's a good or a bad thing, just...strange. The thing that lured me to it was Joseph Gordon-Levitt, seeing as I am an avid fan of his, so I wasn't entirely sure what I was in store for when I started watching this. I know he's not in the movie all that much, so that definitely meant I was going to really have to focus on what was happening.I can say that the acting is really good, and that the characters are easy to relate to at times and are well rounded. I like the cast, not just JGL. And there are three scenes in particular that make the whole thing entirely worth it, but I won't get myself in trouble by making a list.I say you should check it out, definitely, there's no point in not watching it or running away screaming from Shadowboxer. It's just...strange! But who ever said strange was a bad thing?"
4,A good but slightly flawed read,"This book represented something completely new when published in 1966. It was a companion to a 21-part TV documentary series, produced by Irish historians for the Irish. With that in mind, the individual essays with their references to unfamiliar place names as well as some words in the Irish language, are a bit difficult for the general American reader, even one with a background in history. The book would also benefit from a couple of good maps, though I suspect that most Irish are familiar with thier tiny country's geography.The book is just detailed enough to provide a general survey, and the extensive bibliography provides numerous, though some dated, points of departure for more serious students."
4,A Good Beginning,"The book delivers what it's title implies, in a few hundred pages. The different perspectives of the various authors help to reinforce the truth that there are many ways of understanding and interpreting events, even when the facts are agreed upon. After having read the book, the reader knows himself not to be an expert, but has a sense of "" the course of Irish history."""
1,Fragile breaks very easily,"The pop port is a rather difficult port in the first place requiring considerable manipulation in both insertion and removal. Add to that a fragile and cheap low quality product, and you have failure written all over. I bought this and the plastic connector pins on the ends (hooks) broke after 3 insertion and removals.Avoid this product."
4,scosche s10 dash kit,it fits in nicely the tray on the bottom is worthless bend off arms of stock tray and attach under the aftermarket one and it fits nice
1,DANGER! Not real Pyrex! Exploding Junk!,"This is NOT real Pyrex! It is NOT high-temp glass! It explodes in medium-temp heat! Lucky our 3-year old was not in the kitchen when ours blew up, shattered--it sent glass pieces all over the kitchen. JUNK!!! Should get ZERO stars."
2,Fair at Best,"Although there are a number of decent tracks in this set, as a body or work it is not cohesive. The third CD is simply terrible, being only a pastiche of old seventies sounds."
5,this is the truth,Masters at work always puts out products that you can count on them being good. But this one is outstanding. These three CD's have 46 tracks in total; and out of them there are probably six tracks that didn't realy speak to me and that was because I have them on other CD's that I've purchased resently.
1,Nylabone,Didn't seem interested - only sniffed it and then it was no more than a rock to my black lab (90#).I wish I knew that Missing Link for both cats and dogs was a powder. None of the cats (3) and the 12 year old lab likes the taste of the powder so I'm not able to endorse these products. Wish you would come out with capsules.
4,Small!,"I ordered two of these bones. They were a lot smaller than I anticipated. My dogs loved them but I had to take them away after two days because they became a choking hazard. This would be great for smaller dogs, less than 30 lbs."
3,Nylabone,"Got chewed up pretty fast! My dog is a chewer, so this didn't last very long. She needs something tougher"
4,dogs love it!,I have a 2 yr old Vizsla and a 2 mo old Pit and they love this toy! Only reason it didn't get 5* is that I've only had it for 2 months and its already half gone... wish it lasted longer as a chew
1,My dog hates it,He will not even touch it and he will eat everything. I am very disappointed. I bought several nylabone products for my dog and he does not like any of them.
3,Can't choose the dino... sad!,"I have a beagle/jack russel mix. Needless to say, he is very high-energy and does best when given a job to do that involves chewing.He LOVES his Novabone and Nylabone- but tears thru the larger sizes in a single afternoon- so when I saw this I was very happy, because it is an unusual shape and durable! Amazon's iphone app let you scan in an item and find it cheaper on Amazon- so instead of the higher pet shop price, I scored a savings deal on Amazon! Nice!My big, fat, sad complaint is that you cannot CHOOSE the dinosaur! I knew this when ordering and the stegosaurus arrived- honestly I was hoping for the T-Rex or the Brontosaurus but I guess you get what you get. Still, a beagle gnawing on a T-Rex would be pretty funny..."
5,held up so far,"My dog loves this dinosaur! It has been already a month that I purchased this and it still exists up until now; a great deal when you meet our great chewer.The design is great in that it keeps my dog interested in it and the toy keeps a sturdy appeal even though it looks that it would just lose control after a bite from our dog.Overall, a great toy for your dog."
5,Great For Power Chewers!,"Great product for those puppies or adult dogs who can chew through anything. This will keep them busy for sure. Once your pet gets this started, chances are it will be a favorite chew until the nubs wear down. I have two power-chewing Puggles. Unlike everything else I've tried, this is NOT a 5-minute toy. They seek these things out and it satisfies the need for a good long gnawing session."
2,Disappointed,"When they say dinosaur varieties.... they mean they will send you any of the three they want. The picture had shown the t-rex, and the t-rex was the one I wanted. Much to my disappointment, I received a brontosaurus. Now my poor pup will never have his chance at the t-rex. They should really give you a choice before you add it to your shopping bag."
2,Disapointed,I ordered three of these dinosaur nylabones. I only opened one and none of my dogs is interested in it. It is coarse and has no odor to enhance its use to the chewers it is intended for and I'm out a pile of money.
1,Not so good,The little spiny things are too sharp. Caused my dog's mouth to bleed. My dog is a very aggressive chewer and have never had this happen with other chew toys. My dog is in good health so it has nothing to do with that. Just like I said the spiny things are just too sharp!
4,Finally a good Nylabone,"Our Silky Terrier is part dog/part pirana. We bought a regular Nylabone and it was completely destroyed within a couple minutes. Huge pieces were torn out of it and swallowed. I was terrified he would have serious ramifications from it. I contacted Nylabone immediately and they sent me 3 toys more suitable for my ""strong chewer"". One of those was the dental dinosaur durables. He LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy. And after 4 months it is now time to replace it (the head and tail are now missing). I am so please that this toy worked for our pirana dog! :)Other good toys that they sent as replacements were the Nylabone Wishbone and the Nylabone Puzzel Bone."
4,Inexplicably unavailable indie,"I simply don't understand how this particular movie hasn't made it to the DVD format. Many of the actors have gone on to stardom- for one. There are certainly multitudes of titles far inferior to said film that have been produced on DVD- often in several ""pressings"" in different editions! This was (in my useless opinion), the golden age of indie dialog-driven, no murder and/or explosions comedies, dramedies, etc, and it is well represented by an adequate, charming, and enjoyable, if indeed ""inconsequential"", outing via ""WATCH IT"". How's that for a run-on deliberation? I honestly think a great detriment to it's DVD birth is the title. The term ""Watch it"" is too common place in searches and activities and I'd bet this has secured it's obscurity as the two words simply rarely if ever arrive and/or occur in the context of a movie title. Place this sucker on DVD already!"
4,I think its his best.,One of my first albums I bought as a kid. I still love it after all these years. It holds up as one of rhe greats. Melodic synth music.
3,Has Some Good Moments,"This album has a good production and some pretty good songs. This isn't an album I like to listen to from start to finish though. It seems a little more refined and less wild than Human's Lib; not a lot, just a little. Some of the songs just aren't my style or something. Highlights are ""Bounce Right Back,"" ""Like to Get to Know You Well,"" and ""No-One is to Blame."" I never have cared for ""Life in One Day."" A lot of the material on here just doesn't grab me. Human's Lib is a little better. Not a bad release."
4,"Good Telephoto Lens, but not the Best...","First of all this is a Telephoto lens and is meant to take photos of far away objects. For closer shots, there's a problem in auto-focus, but far-away shots are zoomed by approx 50% and appear sharp and focussed. This lens is big and hence blocks the camera flash. But flash is used for closer photos and not for far-away photos. When we attach the lens to camera, there is a black circle in the viewable area. This disappears when we zoom a bit which is quite OK since the photos to be taken with lens are meant to be zoomed. The lens is quite heavy, but the whole assembly (camera + lens) looks very professional. This lens is good but I would recommend to go for higher zoom (3x or 5x)."
4,So far so good,"I have a leak in my power steering system & I was topping up every two weeks before using Lucas 10008 Power Steering Stop Leak. So far, I have only topped up once in a month, so I am pretty sure that at least it is slowing the leak. I will continue using as directed & necessary & hopefully update my results later on...."
2,Did not work but I got my money back,"I have a leak on the top of my steering rack gearbox. I used this product as recommended but it simply did not do anything. It was a waste of time, however they did honor their money back guarantee so that earns 2 stars. Perhaps my leak is just too big. It may still be with a shot for some people, but keep the bottle and receipt in case it doesn't work."
3,Not up to date,"Although this was a pretty good book, I wish I had paid attention to the publishing date (1997). Some of the information is not as accurate now as it was 4 years ago. For example, some of the vendors mentioned in San Juan, Puerto Rico (from where I returned just yesterday) are no longer there. This books needs an updated edition!"
1,Don't buy,"Over time, I've bought 3 of these bulbs to replace dead bulbs in my kitchen overhead lighting. The first bulb lasted 6 months, the second 4 months, and the 3rd buld blew in the first week."
5,All you need in one book,"I checked this book out from my library and after flipping through the first few pages, knew that I had to have it. It has a wide variety of quilts for inspiration, and if that is not enough, patterns and directions for making several of the quilts featured. The instructions are extremly helpful; I have several books and magazines, but none equal the information given in Treasury Of American Quilts."
1,Not 8 Ounce Size As In Product Description!,"I paid a little more for this product because the item description stated that the bottle size was 8 Ounces, and other similar products were 5 Ounces... Sorry I did! The bottle is actually 5 Fl. Ounces. I will not order this product again."
3,Human Services book,"The book was not described as an ""examiners copy"". We'll see if this works for my class. If not, I'll certainly let you know."
5,"A ""must have"" for your Photoshop arsenal","I have many books on Photoshop, but only two or three I recommend to fellow users or my students. Real World is one of them. Blatner and Fraser don't waste a lot of time with the 90 odd filters in Photoshop. Instead they focus on the tools and techniques the user needs to create the best prints or the best on-line graphics. In a world of also-rans, this book is top notch from start to finish. It's essential for beginners, professionals, and upgraders alike."
5,Extraordinay Little Book,"Need I say more? For years I was a curmudgeon about affirmations. I thought they were absolutely ridiculous. This little book was the exact medicine for this weary traveler literally sick over worrying about finances. I have no more financial problems or worry. These affirmations--along with those from ""Violet Ray to Heal Body, Mind, and Soul""--have the tools to eradicate worry and allow abundance to flow. Hurray!"
2,"Good idea, but not enough story","About half way through the book, I finally got tired of waiting for the story to begin and quit reading. She does a good job of building a world, but it's not one either I or the characters want to live in.One of the odd things I noticed is that while the narrator is supposed to be a guy, his personality feels like that of a woman. This may be one of the hazards of writing in the first person where the character is the opposite gender, but it was a bit off putting.The idea is ok, if dystopian, but in the end, I felt that the main insight came early in the book, where the narrator observes that it is strange that so many people want to be someone they aren't, when the main asset they have to offer is their own uniqueness. I was hoping for more strong insights and a gripping story, but sadly, the other main interest in the book is a compilation of good movie quotes."
4,"Essential Junior, essential Blues, essential purchase","Essential, essential blues recordings. Ambiance and realism pour forth from every track. Buddy Guy gives guitar lessons from which aspiring white blues guitarists could learn plenty. This is not some ghastly abomination of black blues filtered through a stack of Marshall amplifiers with a white singer displaying his belly button while butchering another blues rendition, this is the genuine article (OK, the Blues Breakers Mayle/Clapton did good). 'It's My Life Baby!' and Hoodoo Man Blues' are must haves. Junior (rest his soul) and Buddy made careers out of playing together and all blues aficionados have really benefited from it. Rating: Content **** 1/2 audio quality ***1/2"
5,One of the Best Groups You've Never Heard (Ever Hear),"Of Horses, Kids & Forgotten Women. Bought the LP in the 60's for the title alone. Made a copy on reel-to-reel and played the LP until it turned white. Copied the reel-to-reel to cassette and played it in my car (when I finally got a car with a player.)The tape died about two years ago and the reel-to-reel bit the dust a decade ago -- I can still hear the songs in my head. Their version of Arlo Guthrie's ""Highways in the Wind"" is less ironic and far more powerful than the original, their version of Tenbrooks is a standard (next to Steve Gillette's.) ""She Sang Hymns Out of Tune"" surpasses the Dillards.This album (part of the two album set) has stood the test of time."
3,Music that is hard to label. But still an fine ride.,"Due South, the TV show is sometimes called quirky. This CD falls right in line. From 'Drunken Sailor' to 'November', you get everthing from a high energy drinking song to a ballad designed to provoke melancholy. I doubt that anybody will like *all* the cuts, but everyone should find something to like. While I was impressed by Paul Gross' singing on the first album, I don't think that 'Robert Mackenzie' is meant for his voice."
2,for historical fiction fans only,"This book, though I found parts of it absorbing, served to remind me why I do not normally read historical novels. I enjoy novels, and I like reading history, but I find that combining history and fiction more often than not produces a disappointing result, satisfying neither as history or literature. Particularly disconcerting, in Grant Comes East, is to find Dan Sickles losing a leg in August when we know he lost it weeks earlier in Gettysburg; equally upsetting is to encounter Lo Armistead, who was mortally wounded in July, still battling gamely on in August.The ""novel"" requires too great a suspension of unbelief!"
4,GOOD STORY LINE,I ENJOYED THE WHAT IF QUESTION. THE BOOK WAS SLOW AT TIMES BUT DID PICK UP IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK . GOOD BOOK A MUST READ . ALSO WILL THER BE A THIRD BOOK???
1,solar floating pond light,"thought it would be somewhat sumberged therefor eluminating the water, but it only sat on top of water. It only worked for one day. Glad it was only 10 bucks."
4,Very Nice Quality,This shirt was very nicely done. The details in the embroidering are amazing and the shirt itself is a very nice quality. The sizing seems to be right on. Overall I think this will make a great addition to anyone's shirt collection.
4,Knife 5/5 Sheath 5/5 belt strap 2/3,"Thr knife is sturdy and durable, the grip is nice. The sheath is also durable and has plenty of useful features; however it's nearly impossible to pull the knife out of the sheath while its on your belt unless you have the thigh strap attached. I had to jimmy rig it so it doesn't flop around and I can actually pull it from its sheath. Overall 4.5/5"
3,"Well build, but heavy","This knife is well built. Overbuilt actually. It retains an excellent edge, has many useful features like a hammer end, lash points, and quality sheath that attaches to my molle gear. The only thing I will say is that it is surprisingly heavy. I already carry a lot of gear and I am not convinced that the weight of the knife actually lends itself to higher quality.I have had other knives that weigh less and do what I need. Determine if you need this type of knife before you buy it or you probably won't carry it because it is overly heavy."
4,Gerber 22-01629 LMF II Black Infantry Knife- 4.8 inch blade,"Good quality sheath with a lot of options to carry, including a built in sharpener is a plusSharp knife and fits well in the hand, quality constructionI deducted one star because as an INFANTRY knife you need to deploy quickly, and effortlessly; pulling the knife from the sheath requires a little strength, more than what I think is needed; especially if one hand is holding the sheath while the other pulls the knife from the sheath--in a worst case scenario I may just have one good hand I need to be able to deploy my knife with one hand with little effort. I have a Ka-Bar and Ontario Knife Co M9 Bayonet, they deploy easily from their sheaths, come right off!Overall package has the ""cool"" factor being tactical and all"
4,not bad,"its a good functional knife from a reliable US manufacturer, at a decent price. it comes in a box with a multi faceted sheath. it has good weight and cuts well. i did not give it five stars though, because i have yet to take it out on a trip."
3,it makes a fortune (not yours),"well, it's their forth. good enough for people who don't read magazines at all, it gethers a lot of so-call contemporary fashion photos in a book for a good coffee-table vaule, but i think it's only ""so-call contemporary"", for something more contemporary, try ""dazed/confused"""
4,No Rough Stone Rolling,"This book was the precursor to Rough Stone Rolling, and it only treats the life of Joseph Smith up to the Kirtland era. For that reason, I felt like I was left hanging.Probably due to it's shorter length, Beginnings of Mormonism is better edited than Rough Stone Rolling and lacks that vaguely rambling tone. If you've read or own Rough Stone Rolling, you won't find anything new in this book and will probably be disappointed. It's only worth buying Beginnings of Mormonism nowadays unless you're a collector.As a silly personal aside, can't somebody update the cover of this book? Gosh, I felt like I needed to put on another dustjacket while I was reading it -- so ugly!"
3,not so pleasant,"Either the blade is not sharp enough, or the rotation speed is too slow, sometime it hurts."
2,;0(,Everybody gave a long description about the movie already I won't tell you not to watch it but for me PERSONALLY it pained my eye to watch it it was a D list movie at it's finest. But omg I couldn't I was watching it to kill time
3,No priduct Support From Phillips,"Even Though The FWR 55 is a sleek machine there is one problem in playing mp3's; there is up to a seven second gap between songs. I burned two cd-r formats (ISO 9660 and Joilet) and both experienced the same problem...the seven second gap between songs. I called Philips for product support and they were worthless. They couldn't give me a valid reason for the gaps. Then they wanted to charge me for a tech support call.I own a couple of other mp3 component players and neither have the seven second gap when playing the mp3's.I do think the WOOX technology is great, however, for the price of this unit and the lack of support from Philips, I could not recommend this."
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this system for obvious reasons, compile CD-R with songs of my own CD collection, but to my surprise the system didn't work!First of all some of my commercially bought CD's wouldn't play, it just showed the ""UNFINALIZED DISC"" message , and the MP3 encoded CD-R's played fairly since it took a long time to change tracks, the sound quality is OK."
4,"Great condition, great price!","I'll admit that when you are spending about $.65 on a book, you don't expect much. But this book came in great condition and in a timely fashion."
1,Did not receive,"I did not receive this product and it's been a month today that I ordered it. All they could tell me is the day they sent it, but they had no information on how they sent it (first class USPS, priority, bulk) and there was no knowledge of the whereabouts of the package, tracking, etc. Very disappointed. Wasted my money."
4,In-Home Boot Camp - great for the over 40!,"I had originally intended to purchase the P90X product and am I so glad I decided on the P90 In-Home Boot Camp instead. The In-Home Boot camp is challenging enough for someone that has been working out on a 'somewhat' regular basis and is looking for something new. I wish the tapes didn't emphasis push ups so much - folks with weak wrists (think carpal tunnel) like myself will have to improvise until the wrists gets stronger. Overall, it gets the heart pumping at whatever level you chose to follow the exercises."
2,Not portable,"Beware. Only works if you carry DVDs and DVD player (or have computer with DVD). Cannot copy to computer or play on portable device. Very tough for road warriors. It is truly best for ""in home"". I tried emailing beach body with this question and never got a response so I decided to purchase and try it. No luck and finally got help from live chat (nice feature). Wish that they made this easier to bring with me. iPad version would be even better.How good is it? Not sure. Have been on the road since I got it and I am sure that it will be tough to stay on program because is not portable enough. Rating it low for this reason"
3,Wife Wanted.,Really boring and kind of out dated. It's funny how people think that working out in their home will be so much easier than working out at a gym or outside.
3,It's OK... but I should have invest my money in something else...,"I bought this program from BeachBody.com hoping to have a good start before buying P90x. This was disappointing... The videos are so boring and so old fashion that you think you're back in the 80's, however, I liked the resistance bands and the information that comes with it. I feel that this company is so greedy and cheap that they don't worry to update their videos, they only want your money.The progress bar that you see on the videos is the only cool thing I could see, but the music, the background and everything else looks hideous, the videos are so old that they look blurry in your TV.The workouts are OK, but I prefer something that makes me sweat more... I've used the Jillian Michaels videos and also Hip hop abs with Shaun T and those are great workouts, you feel that you're rally exercising, but this is simply BORING... I recommend to invest your money in something else..."
