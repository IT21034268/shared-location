5,Guaranteed Tough,"I have owned Dewalt 18 volt drills since they were 2-speed models years ago and this drill meets and exceeds my expectations. Very powerful, and well balanced with great run-time. I own 3 of these drills and use them for driving lags to building doghouses. Dewalt's quality is very impressive and they have never let me down."
5,Excellent.,As typical for Brooke Siler...this is a terrific pilates book for the beginner or the advanced student.A great staple in for the pilates buff.Do buy this book!
5,Pilates Body Challenge,"This is a comprehensive book including use of machines at the gym,as well as home exercises without equipment. It also has beginner to advanced directions. It incorporates exercises for different types of problems. There are alot of helpful photos and drawings."
1,R&D Nightmare,"First off, I am a huge HP fan!!! The R&D department should be fired for making this printer. This is the worst printer I have ever used & by far the loudest. I have had 2 of these printers now & they always jam up no matter what type of paper you use. I am taking this one back too & getting a high end HP color laser. All I can say about this product is stay far away & don't even consider thinking about buying one. BTW I am still a huge HP fan."
3,ISABELLA 5394PL,"TWO OF THE FOUR GLOBES ARRIVED BROKEN. TWO PAIR OF GLOBES WERE STACKED RATHER THAN SEPARATED. I WOULD HAVE CREATED A SEPARATE RESTING AREA IN THE FOAM PACKAGE, I.E., POOR PACKAGE DESIGN. THE POSITIVES: NICE LAMP AND GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE IN REPLACING GLOBES. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN A WEEK AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THE REPLACEMENTS YET."
2,Great movie - terrible DVD-version...!,"""Cruising"" is a great, underrated movie, no doubt about that. Gay cult-filmmaker Bruce LaBruce was right when he wrote that no other film depicts the S&M-scene in NYC better than that film...there is just one big problem with this Special-Edition-DVD: William Friedkin couldn't resist tinkering with the visual style of the film. For example, he changed the colours, so that each scene either has a heavy blue-ish or green-ish tone to it. That looks silly and disturbs the realistic atmosphere of the film. Even more disastrously, he added visual effects to Pacino's famous dancing scene - probably to heighten the feeling that Pacino's character is getting crazy. (As if we didn't know). The problem is: those stroboscope-effects look horribly cheap and totally take you out of the scene. The scene was the emotional highlight of the film. Now it is the lowpoint. Friedkin ruined his own film. What a shame."
4,Cruising: the waiting was worth it.,"The waiting was worth it. I have waited for years to watch the uncensored version on dvd. Al Pacino acts great and he is really into the character.Although the story is not that good to me this film is a documentof how the GAY leather scene was in the seventies/eighties.The making of .... on this DVD gives a lot of information I did not know yet. For example: all the movie sounds are ""handmade"". Great job.Al Pacino is not too happy about this film I think because he is not in the making of.... and that is bit of a bummer. I would love to hear his opinion in retrospective about this movie.Besides the storyline of murderer kills gays the message is clear in this movie: do you know who you really are?Very universal, don't you think?"
3,"""Cruising"" is not all that bad","While this film was extremely controversial and a complete critical failure when released in 1980, it would be recognized today as a very brave and adventurous film. After hearing so much about it, I had to see it, and it wasn't all that bad. The script is not that great, and the film's depiction of homosexuals is offensive and offputting, but Pacino and Sorvino turn in fairly solid performances. The film has a dark, gritty feel to it, which adds to the eerie feel of the production. Trust me, there's worse films out there. ""Armageddon,"" for example."
1,A tribute to homophopic straights.,"I saw Crusing in Chicago when it came out, and after its long enough run, the number of crimes against gays in and around the larger ghettos for gays increased substantially.After I left the theatre with three other people, we got to our car and were chased for blocks in South Chicago by very mean looking people, who at red lights shouted epithets from the film. This happened, and Crusing initiated it.If it were a work of art,with merit, opening up issues, then the incident I went through might have been understood as insane people doing insane things.But Crusing is not art,and,it teaches hate and promotes physical violence toward gay people; and it is shocking that Friedkin, after Boys in the Band, could make such an anti gay film, and with such awful acting.It was and still remains one of the more shameful portraits of gays as predatory, promiscuous, and homocidal.Avoid this film."
2,Good book for those with no experience.,"This is a great book for those with no call center experience. I was hoping to learn something new in the call monitoring section, and was sorely disappointed. I have worked in call centers for over 10 years, and in QA for almost 3, and found nothing in this book that I didn't already know."
5,New Dewalt Battery,Purchased this for my husband As a replacement for a 12 year old battery that only stayed charged for 20 minutes. The new one is working great!
3,Battery is NOT as advertized,"The Dewalt DC9091 battery is clearly marked in the upper right hand corner of the paper insert as ""-with 25% more run-time than standard 14.4V batteries."" Compare this to the 40% more run time advertized. I am disappointed I did not get the remaining 15% capacity. Other than that, the battery is great, It fits my drill, fits my charger, and the combination of drill & battery fits in my case."
5,dependable and top quality,"As always Dewalt products and accessories for cordless tools are the benchmark. I have many cordless tools all Dewalt and use them daily. The batteries for these tools are long lasting, powerful and highly reliable. These batteries have lasted me over 4-5 years with daily use. Will only use Dewalt brand and have just purchased more cordless Dewalt products in the past week. If you want something you can rely on go Dewalt."
4,great tool - one caution,"Although Stanley makes a slightly more compact ""rotator"" ratchet, I bought this one because of the 1/4 inch hex drive, which works great with a cordless screwdriver. Feel stupid admitting that I whacked myself on the head with the removable handle. It removed itself all too quickly when a bolt broke while I was pulling on the handle...as the angle decreased towards me the friction retainer could not prevent my hand and handle - with a hard metal cap! - from coming back at my forehead. It was an unusual position working on the boat but a definite possibility that could be easily cured by providing a simple pushbutton release on the handle.It has saved me a lot of time working in corners where there just isn't any room to use a regular screwdriver or ratcheting handle, and the 90 degree configuration is more useful than the angled ""skewdriver"".Definitely a tool that should be in your box."
1,Not Impressed,"I am either too literal, too linear, too unimaginative, too normal, or some combination therein, to find anything remotely advantageous about reading this book, other than being prepared for class (it's required reading). I was not shocked, disgusted, horrified, entertained, touched, enthused, enraged, or enraptured. Maybe a little frustrated.I will definitely be keeping this one in the bathroom. Not for reading, but in case I run out of T.P.Guess I'm just not progressive enough to ""get it.""Here's the one I couldn't put down:Shock & Awe (Macmillan New Wrting)"
5,THE BEST COMPUTER GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best computer game I have ever played.Pros:graphics are good,you get lots of heroes on good story,on skirmish you can build huge army's,you can get lots of awesome powers.Bads:people are slow,Mordor has no castle,it takes a while to load sometimes,it's hard to get points like to summon the Barlog or Army of the dead.Over all it's a awesome game and its worth every penny.Hope this helped you."
5,the best rts ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this is more like an rts/rpg hybrid with all the heroes that you get, the coolest fact that the characters get carried over to the next mission. it is simply the best.the graphics are awesome, the sound and voices incredible, and gameplay is wonderful for me, since i am not a rts veteran. there is very little micromanagement and more focus on combat which suits me just fine.other reviewers complained that there are not enough armies. i think this is just fine, or it will be chaotic like in rome, total war (graphics suck compared to bfme)i love this game. i have been playing the campaign and skirmish modes for the past 4 months almost daily. sadly, i am going to uninstall it because it is taking too much of my time, and i am not getting any work done.the few gripes i had like zooming in 3d mode and capture middle earth risk type game seem to be implemented in bfme 2, so i am waiting for that.highly recommended to tolkein fans, rpg fans and rts fans."
2,Tuscany Inside the Light,"If you are familiar with Meyerowitz's gorgeous book ""Cape Light"" you will be disappointed in Tuscany. The Cape Cod book was published by the Boston Musuem of Fine Arts and contained wonderful color saturated plates. Tuscany, on the other hand, looks like an amateur effort. The skies are washed out, there is little definition in much of the landscape photos and it is simply mediocre and uninspiring. I am assuming this is the fault of the publisher since Meyerowitz is, in my opinion, a first rate color photographer."
3,Somewhere between cheesy and acceptable,"It's true that you get what you pay for. At a mere $5 (I bought it for $2 on ebay) a few of the girls are attractive, and the camera angles give you what you want. But, the whole thing is a stretch. This isn't something you really want anyone to know that you have, let alone watch with you. While I haven't watched the SI Swimsuit DVD, it was around $7 at Wal-Mart, and no doubt more professional. So if you're bored and only have a few bucks, knock yourself out. But I doubt that I'll watch this more than 10 more times throughout the rest of my life."
4,A little-known gem!,"This book combines an engaging narrative story style in the tradition of Will James with philosophical musings a la Thoreau, and caps it with a stirring call to action reminiscient of Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"". Dayton Hyde's observations on the plight of our endangered native species are still so fresh and relevant that it's hard to believe the book is over 30 years old! Don't mistake this book for some boring, preachy diatribe, though. It is more than anything else a charming love story about Hyde's passion for Sandhill Cranes and his adventures with them over twenty years while ranching in Oregon and raising a family of five human children and assorted other wildlife."
4,Speakers,I purchased two sets of these for mine and my friends horse trailers. May sound strange to some of you but horse trailers and some campers have speakers on the outside to listen while hangig out. I only found marine speakers for this. I had no problems with the install and they have held up great. It has been over a year now with good results. I wish they were a better sound quality but that could be my stereo etc. I would like to be able to turn them up a bit more without distortion but they are really pretty good for my application.
5,Great speakers for all around sound,"Bought these speakers for our SeaRay yacht. Bought two pair to put up on the bridge. They have an overall great sound. Clear highs and solid mid-range that isn't ""muddy"". They are powered by a Clarion amp and handle the power very well. The construction of the speakers is top notch and are sealed for marine use. If you're looking for a quality speaker with quality sound that will not break your wallet, look no further."
5,Love it,"This is one of my favorite pieces' of art work, and was thrilled to receive it as a gift and will be hung in a prominent place."
3,American Land Birds,"I was disappointed. One of the pages had been taped and the book seemed to be in just o.k. condition. This was my first time buying a used book off of Amazon, so I wasn't sure what to expect."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"We use this printer at work. It sucks...makes a ton of noise but nothing ever comes out. It takes literally 10 minutes for the first sheet to come out after a bunch of blinking lights and noise. Have you ever seen the movie Office Space. Well this needs to be ""office Spaced"" and destroyed with a bat. When print out comes out it's all covered in random ink. The paper get's jammed all the time and lights just blink for no reason. I don't know where HP got a good reputation of printers but most of the ones I've used sucked. I've used an all in one printer also where it just broke in months. The toner ran out like every 3 months. So if don't get this printer."
2,Nothing Special,"Its a camera strap... nothing special. I can't even say that I bothered to take it out of the package. Nothing really wrong with it, just wanted a little something more... longer would have been better."
1,A Killing Affair,"This is not the correct movie which stars ; Elizabeth Montgomery and O,J. Simpson. This is the wrong movie . The movie you are selling is starring Peter Weller. Plese correct this as soon as possible"
1,Misleading advertising,"I was looking SPECIFICALLY for Elizabeth Montgomery movies and received something else with the same title. The image for this movie is of the wrong cover. It needs to be changed! I have purchased several things through Amazon and its sellers, have never had this problem before but now I know to be completely thorough when making further purchases from this website if I even ever decide to do so again."
2,Not Happy with Product...,"Have had this almost a month. I work for the phone company and have (tried) to use it everyday. The battery sits loosely in the charger base and does not make very good contact. It does not seem to charge battery very well. After charging for 24 hours the unit does not perform like I expected-not much torque - use it mainly for installing and removing jack faceplates-runs out of power quickly.I like the size and feel and the led light option is nice-Just wish the charge lasted at least thru one work day.I have a B&D; 3.2 volt smart driver that has more power and works all week without recharging doing the same type of work. It also has a led light and a screw guide. The price was comparable and it is a better tool.I'll use it for a spare, but would probably send it back if I could.Would suggest the Manufacture improve the battery charger base and go to a lithium battery-even if you charged a little more."
1,junk,Do not buy this product. It runs out of battery power real fast & the batteries are NOT replaceable.DuraPro Company will not help you if drill is over 2 years old.
5,MUST HAVE FOR EVERY DEACON OR DEACONESS,"THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY ONE WHO IS IN THE MINISTRY OR THINKING ABOUT GETTING INTO, IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR PEOPLE OUT SIDE OF THE MINISTRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE DEACON MINISTRY"
4,I have lost my way again,"Hello World,Sounds great on ""big watt"" home system. Fog makes disc worth the chump change alone!\ By It! Do it!!!"
1,DVD version not as advertised,"My comments are not aimed at the merits of this fine film but at the recent DVD release by Anchor Bay. The cover boasts that the version it contains is ""uncut & uncensored""; however, that claim is false. Inexplicably missing is the entire ""nightgown"" scene with Bridget Fonda, which should appear just after the orgy. I'm pretty sure that this scene appears in every other version of the movie. I'm almost certain it was in the R-rated general release, I know it is in the ""uncut"" VHS tape, and part of it even appears in the broadcast televsion version. In fact, watching the censored TV cut of that segment on BBC America a month or so ago is what inspired me to order the DVD in the first place. Now I just feel ripped off. This is not the first time I've purchased DVDs that were missing key scenes, but this instance was particularly galling."
2,Not worth it,"I purchased this book to help me study for the Hobet. It was reccomended by the director of the X-ray tech program I am applying to. While I have yet to take the test, and do not know the exact layout, I think most would be better off buying one of those online study guides the best one I found was www.apexpreparation.com/hobet/ you get tons of reading and math questions for like 20 bucks! I found that to be much more helpful.The book does offer some good tips about math rules, etc. However be warned this book contains what I consider an unacceptable number of typos, spelling and grammar errors for a study guide. Anyone who bought this book will you tell you the same.Honeslty It's ok as start, but I think ivesting in an online guide would be much better. In other words don't rely on it solely!"
3,A must and a bust....,"Purple Rain was by far the biggest influence on me when I was coming of age. What better way to learn the in's and out's of sex and relationships than from the master. Prince demonstrates his firm command and understanding of the opposite sex. Everything I learned I learned from this film. How do be esoteric, sexual, ego driven, reclusive, aggressive, artistic and withdrawn all at the same time. I have since found that women really respond to such a collection of emotions.Fame was about a boarding school in New York City that catered to teenagers with delusions of becoming famous. Frankly dealt with teenage pregnancy and the value of friendship."
1,N'achetez pas ce DVD!!!,"Il s'agit d'une version à peine légale de la version anglo-américaine (et noir et blanc) du superbe film couleur et en franais de Sacha Guitry de 1954. La compagnie ihffilm.com, qui se spécialise dans les films historiques, offre également une version en anglais seulement de ce chef-d'oeuvre, mais elle est au moins en couleurs et la qualité visuelle est supérieure. À quand les films en franais pour francophones d'Amérique? À quand les versions Criterion restaurées de ""Si Versailles m'était conté"", ""Napoléon"", ""Le Diable boiteux"", ""Le Destin fabuleux de Désirée Clary"", etc. (tous de Sacha Guitry). Note: Il existe une version RUSCICO du ""Destin fabuleux..."" en couleurs, en franais et en russe, mais en version PAL seulement. Il serait peut-tre temps de fonder les Amis de Sacha Guitry en Amérique..."
3,Batman seventies style - The way it's SUPPOSED to be,"There has been some criticism here about the storytelling here - that it's old school, etc. It's SUPPOSED to be that way. This is a sequel to Englehart and Rogers' classic run on DC's Detective Comics from the late '70s.One criticism was that the lettering was done by hand. Well, back in those days, it was done that way. You could tell back then just by looking at a word balloon or caption who did the lettering. It was distinctive, unlike generic lettering done by computer.If you liked the classic stories from the '70s, this is a fine reprise of that period's storytelling conventions (thought balloons, expository captions, etc). If you are looking for a modern approach to the Batman, there are several alternatives that can be found here.Enjoy this story for what is - a fun, colorful revival of a great period in comics storytelling by the people who were there in the first place."
4,Nice!,I love these cutters. The quality is great and are a good weight. I was concerned that they could be flimsy but they are not at all. My only concern is that when they arrived- the plastic box they came in was shattered- making it useless. With as many cutters that are in the package - a container is needed to protect them. May return them and reorder if I cannot get another container from amazon.
2,I feel disappointed with Osborne's exam titles,"I bought a few exam books from Osborne for my Oracle and MCAD exams. The oracle one, I have nothing else to say but ""incomplete"" coverage. Well, I thought it might be the author's issue, so I bought this book for my 305 again. After reading the first half (350 pages), I feel my $ was wasted again. The content is not well organized at all and errors are everywhere (I even doubt the authors speak English well). For code example, forget about it. I have to buy another Wrox book, ""Professional Vb .Net (2nd)"", to make sure I'm OK with the test objectives. I think Osborne is shooting its feet for publishing this ""rush and dirty"" books without serious review. For me, this is the last book from them, definitely."
3,Not checked for accuracy,"This book contains a number of errors, both in the text itself, and in the programming examples. The errors are obviously confusing and frustrating, since you're trying to learn the material and prepare for the test - the last thing you want to be doing is trying to figure out the authors' mistakes.The core material *is* covered in the text; it's just that you'll be spending time going back and forth between pages trying to reconcile contradictory statements, or going nuts trying to figure out why step 3 in some exercise doesn't produce what the authors said it would.If you already know ASP.NET and ADO.NET fairly well, you should be able to guess what the authors were shooting for, and this may be a decent exam prep for you. I wouldn't try actually trying to learn from this (i.e., if you're under a tight deadline to learn the material and get certified)."
5,My Dog Skip,"A great family movie. Everyone can relate to a child bonding with their first pet. It makes you laugh, cry a little and feels your heart you joy."
1,If I could give negative stars I would,"(...)If your looking for a corny movie to laugh at and make sarcastic remarks with friends throughout, this is the movie for you. Anyone with any taste in art or film will realize that this movie is attempting to be something it only wishes it could be. Just another testimony of how the Hollywood American movie system corrupts semi-talented people (see the difference between Amorres Perros and this movie and you will be horrified at how virtually every talented director eventually sells out to these cons). It reawakened a desire in me to produce my own independent feature because I could fart on a roll of film and it would be a better movie than this."
3,"PENN, DEL TORO & WATTS O.K. BUT...............","Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benecio del Toro gave good performances but the disjointed, flash back......flash forward......flash back.......flash forward..........(ad nauseum) plot line was unnecessary. The movie could have been filmed with events in chronological order and been just as effective."
1,A script in search of a real life,"The script is a soap opera. And the slicing of the chronology was an attempt to hide that fact. I also hated all the gratuitous and melodramatic guy fights, all the guns, all the blood. Fine actors (as these actors all are) are too often put in the position (or put themselves in the position!!!) of having to work with really awful scripts. Melissa Leo's performance really shines, and seems to have been almost totally ignored in both the handing out of awards and in so many of the reviews of this theatrical and horribly manipulative movie."
1,Its like a bad puzzle,"My boyfriend and I watched this movie the other day, and we were lost during most of the movie. The movie switches from the past to present and somewhere in between and it is really hard to follow. We kept asking each other, ""is this the beginning, or the end?"" The storyline wasn't that great either, only two major events and the rest was pretty boring.So, if you still want to see it, rent it! Don't waste your money buying it."
4,Well Done,I bought this movie without seeing it on a hunch. I have to say this movie was not amazing but it was darn good. All the actors did a very good job including sean penn. Benecio though was the standout giving a performance. I would strongly recommend this movie to everybody.Well worth the time.
4,Great balance beam,"We purchased this for our granddaughter; age eight. She loves it! It is the prefect product; pretty and strong. Shipping was quick and accurate.One problem: Although the assembly is incredibly easy, our beam did not have the holes for the screws in the proper place. Both sets of holes for the screws were at one end of the beam (on the bottom)...Quality Control issue. My husband remedied this by getting his drill and measuring tape and in two minutes had drilled two holes in the end without holes and affixed the stabilizer cross pieces."
1,Your call........ -Jult Warfell,"I had no high hopes for this series and true to my opinion, I was sadly dead on. Words cannot display how much time I invested watching this and its second half, not to mention the cabbage I wasted purchasing the two. -Jult Warfell"
1,This camera is a disgrace to photographers everywhere,"It's bling.And it's a camera.What more can you need?Minox, thou hath sinned, and thou shalt never be forgiven.I am disappoint..."
3,Just ok,"I bought this book because of the glowing reviews, but found it to be an average read, and only then because I am from Phoenix. If I were not from Phoenix, I would have found it boring."
2,Worked for one year,"This machine worked good for one year. It did spurt hot water now and then, but overall I was very happy with it and loved how it steamed knits, blazers, etc. I used distilled water and cleaned it periodically, but one day it just stopped working. The commercial label is a joke because I used it once or twice a week for home use. I can't imagine using it for commercial purposes."
5,Perfect for new big sis,"Our 20-month old just got a new little sister, and this book is great for letting her know how important she is, even with the new addition."
1,Great Sound Quality but Microphone went out after 4 months,"I was talking on ventrillo one day and all of a sudden the microphone just stopped working. I always take care of my equipment. I don't throw it down and I keep it away from heat. or magnetics. I can't explain it. When it worked, it was great. I paid way too much for just 4 months of usage. I can not recommend this product."
4,Great head phones!,These are great headphones; my only grip would be they don't fit very snug. But the other side to this is they are very comfortable and sound great! I would recommend them to anyone.
4,Pnantronics USB Headset,"I have had the headset for a couple of week now. Besides using the headset on my work laptop with my new VOIP phone, I have been using it on my home PC while I online gaming.The headset has worked great. I have had no issues. When I ask the folks I talk to on my VOIP service how I sound they say great. They never realized it was a VOIP call.If there was one was one thing I would wish for would be to have the headset a little less bulky. I wish Plantronic would offer a single ear headset as the higher end."
3,Not the best product...,this headphones sound good and so does the microphone..but they tend to fall off your head because that rubber-band isn't tight enough to hold then around your ears. I have to punch new holes n wrapped it to the frame with clear tape so it can embrace my head a bit tighter. Buy it at your own discrete.
1,dont do it...,...unless you like bad handheld footage and fish getting shot at close range by retards.
2,Not for a pro,"I decided I would try this product because of the price, but wish I had my money back. It would work for the occasional hair cutter but if you have to live in it all day, like I do, you would give it a 2 stat rating too. I'm not going into the ""one size fits most"" part of it ( that's like saying ""you should have know better"") but the thing that is the biggest problem is the material that it is made of. It reminds me of the stuff that cheep rain suites are made of. it's stiff, loud, and doesn't breath. When I first got it, and seen how stiff it was, I throw it in the washer hoping that washing it would brake it down and make it easier to live with. As the water ran over it - it beaded up and ran off. When it was finished, and I pulled it from the washer, it laughed at me in defiance and said, ""you thought you could brake me but you have failed."" So to finish on a positive note - you can spill your coffee on it and it will run right off."
2,I don't understand all the praise,"This books has quite a few excess words. I am very disappointed. I prefer Norman Lewis, who wrote an ample number of travel accounts."
2,Latin for Americans,"I am taking Latin 3 now out of this series. It is, in my opinion too hard, and not explained in an easily understood manner. I am a good student, I won two gold medals in the National Latin Exam, but I still find this book very hard. I agree with leigh."
3,Intellivision- How Can You Lose?,"I think most of the titles made for Intellivision still have entertainment value. Although my grown children all have the Latest and supposedly the Greatest current gaming technology, you won't hear any of them knock these old titles I helped them learn and enjoy before they found out about these other modern systems. I still play a little Pac-Man or Night Stalker lo these 3 decades later once in awhile :-)"
3,LOTS OF FUN--GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"This atmospheric and (at times) stylish film is lots of fun and offers up some genuinely creepy and disturbing moments. It's not the caliber of Polanski's The Tenant, but it is highly entertaining and, for the most part, well done. The only downside is the ending--it simply doesn't live up to the rest of the movie. Had the ending been better (and this movie deserves a far better ending), The 4th Floor would be an absolute knockout. As is, it's good--not great, but worth owning if you love creepy, frightening thrillers."
2,Not What I'd Expected,"After reading the 3 reviews, I'd expected The 4th Floor to be fairly good, but it was disappointing. Too many ""suspects""....nearly everyone In the movie. I thought it was mostly irritating and only kept watching, expecting it to get better. It didn't."
1,Distressed White Wood Plant Stand,Not constructed very well. Wood split when putting together.Product came warped. Asked for a refund. Would not recommend.
2,A Different Track List,"I searched around on Amazon, trying to match my CD with one of Amazon's. I came closest to this one. My images matched what was already presented including the track list shown on the back cover which does not match Amazon's list. Here is my track list for clarity.1. Embraceable you2. More Than You Know3. Night and Day4. God Bless the Child5. Tell Me More6. St. Louis Blues7. The Man I Love8. All of Me9. Gloomy Sunday10. I'm Yours11. He's Funny That Way12. Here It Is Tomorrow Again"
3,IT WAS ALRIGHT,since my foglights were smoked out i guess it was not as bright as i wishes it would been. but i mean it does the job pretty good and it was the yellow i wanted cant argue wit the pricing. you get what you pay for!
5,A must have for the beginner and professional DBA,When I started programming this was the first book on MySQL I purchased. It taught me everything I needed to get started designing schema's and programming. It also taught me basic PHP! The examples used in this book to outline PHP/MySQL interaction are clear and easy to program. The author uses an include-based programming technique very similar to fuse-box. Read the first few chapters (the rest are reference) and you will have everything you need to know to get started and build upon. I keep this book on my desk as I frequently use it to refresh my query knowledge.
2,Not for the Windows Programmer,"Heavy emphasis on Unix (ok), Light emphasis on Windows (bummer),Book is somewhat scattered in thought. Good content though, and I suspect a second edition will clear up a lot.The 'PHP an dMySQL' book by Sams is scattered too. But it came with an outstanding PDF formatted manual that has saved my A**.Amazing that out of two books, I'm having to resort to a PDF.If someone could of just tutorialed getting the basics down for Windows users."
1,Disappointing,"This review is difficult for me to write because I really love Bryan's Tone and Sweat videos. Both make me work hard and sweat. But, this video is more for a beginner yoga practicioner. I've been practicing Yoga for 2 years and go to Power Yoga classes in addition to practicing at home with tapes.This video is not fast paced and it is not a vinyasa flow as Tone or Sweat. There are no push ups during vinyasa and the poses are not as challenging.If you want a challenging workout that will make you sweat and lose weight, practice Tone or Sweat, Mark Blanchard's tapes or David Swenson's Primary Series.Bryan, I was so looking forward to new tapes, but I am very disappointed. Please put your new audio CD of your class into a video. That would be an amazing Yoga workout.Namaste."
2,PW877X 8 inch Subwoofer,"If you want a cheap subwoofer then buy this one. If you want deep rich bass out of your sound system, keep looking. I bought two of these to attempt to enrich my sound. This speaker is good on the mid range and highs in your sound system, but the lower range of bass is punchy and hollow. NOT a good investment of my money."
2,Telling both sides of the story,"I bought the book to see if it was written objectively. I noticed that the adverse effects of these procedures and treatments, transplants and so forth were hidden between the lines. Yes the book was researched but an open mind for the side-effects were dismissed or deemed treatable. They have it all wrong, study the future effects to our genetic pool and be honest with yourselves. Xenotransplant will cure but it will also change the evolution of the human species. Get your credit and fame now because in a few more years these new genes will change or damage the basic design of our DNA. Face it, the only ones that will profit from this therapy are Medical professionals' and Attorneys. The human species will suffer for it as the medical association hauls in the cash."
5,I'm so pleased I bought this CD- you should too...,"Wildflowers is such a precious song- it and undying love are worth the price alone. Genie is a one-of-a-kind gem, but she reminds me a bit of other artists I love like Dan Fogleberg, John Denver, Alison Krauss, and Jewel."
1,Use this and get your bike STOLEN,This product will NOT stop your bike from being stolen. My bike wasstolen using this lock in broad daylight in a high traffic area of SanFrancisco. This lock will only stop a person with no tools. Boltcutters go through this lock like a hot knife through butter. It won't slowa theif down more than 2 seconds.
4,A funny and fantastic book.,"Other than Chips being a little hard-to-love, this was a very funny story and you eventually love Chips, despite his attitude"
1,the truth,"A description of how bad it can be for a father,depressing. Not helpful. I can see why so many womenendorse this book - I'm sure they would like theirchildren's fathers to give up with out a fight.I would recommend: ""Live-Away Dads: Staying a Partof Your Children's Lives When They Aren't a Part ofYour Home"" by William Klatte if you are looking foradvice on how to make the best of a bad situation.Hang in there dad, don't walk away."
5,"""God is No Laughing Matter""","What a relief from the old axioms that God is a ""sour puss"" just waiting for us to sin so He can punish us. Julia's way of explaining God is refreshing, uplifting, and at times even laugh out loud funny.One of my favorites is in the chapter ""God's Will"", where she talks about God baking a lemon pie as we sit eating a lettuce leaf. I won't say more because it would take away from the impact of reading it. I thought of myself in that situation and decided that God is baking chocolate chip cookies (my favorite) and from here on, I'm going to savor every single cookie and not feel the least bit of guilt. Reading the book will explain what I'm saying.I'm sure there are those who would think her a heretic or worse, but I believe she makes God REAL and approachable, and I give her kudos. We need more reading like this."
5,Concise & Comprehensive Greyhound Reference,"Excellent resource for anyone who is interested in or contemplating rescuing a retired racer.AFTER reading this book cover to cover (2 sittings), I adopted the most wonderful ex racing girl of 8 years. It is the best thing I have ever done.If you will always keep your dog leashed and are genuinely interested in this sweet, loving and gentle breed please get this book and bring one of these wonderful Greyhound K9's into your heart and home forever. You will be so happy you did.However, beware... one greyhound is good, two is better, three... it is known as the potato chip effect! These dogs, these exquisite creatures and the unique brand of love and devotion they offer is infectious. One is never enough."
5,The perfect book for girls!,"As an English teacher, I am always looking for books to recommend to my students. I came across Dr. Erika Shearin Karres' book, Fab Friends and Best Buds and couldn't keep my hands off it. It is the perfect book for middle school/high school girls that deals right at the heart of many girls' challenges: relationships. Karres' book is filled with fun chapters, quizzes, and practical advice. Finally, a book that teaches character education in a fun and practical way! I wish I had a book like this when I was younger. I would recommend this book to any young girl and, in fact, I'm getting a copy for my niece."
4,Quick and easy!,"I have had this personal hair remover for more than 3 months now and my wife loves it. It is so much easier to shape those eye brows and to remove unwanted facial hair, without pain. The problem with this hair remover is that....you will not get a close removal of hair unless you do it repetedly and by holding the machine at different angles to cut the hair. This unit is also very delicate and my machine just broke the head with one fall on to the floor. But this gets 4 stars for its quick and easy removal of hair, painlessly and for the price everyone must try this."
2,Cheap but you get what you pay for,The radio is not comfortable to wear and the tuner is very hard to adjust. Sound quality is not great. I am sorry to have purchased it.
4,Songs+Texture+Mood= Headphones On and Wishing the World Away,"For Northwest fans of this band, consider this CD a promise kept; the alchemy of Down Pilot and producer Tucker Martine has resulted in an album that's both sonically arresting yet quietly confident. Down Pilot don't swagger; they sway.I know it's not hip to compare a band to R.E.M. anymore since that group's indie cache is long spent on Nudie suits and Learjet flights, but damn if vocalist Paul Hiraga's sweet, tactile vocals don't conjure up a similar sense of foggy longing (think ""Country Feedback"" with a few Radiohead guitar spirals mixed in, and you've got a sense of the terrain).Ethereal without being obtuse, moody without being standoffish, ""Leaving Not Arriving"" doesn't pack the obviousness to get them a gold record, but it's sure going to win them some hearts. Is yours next?"
1,the clip broke instantly,the cover is cool but the clip (which is funky and cheap) broke upon removal from pkg
3,Opening for click wheel is too small,"I have the ToughSkin case and I really like the way it looks beyond all the other cases I have seen. I don't like the size of the opening for the click wheel though. It makes it difficult, yet not impossible, to change tracks.I use my iPod in my truck and I like the rubber skin because it stops the iPod from sliding on the ground or down into my seatbelt openings.Other than that, I like it. If they made a larger opening, I would buy another; it seems it would be a perfect case for me then..."
4,Plantronics DSP-400 Headset/Mic,"Does what it is supposeed to. I would not recommend installing the ProSono software, however, expecially if you have a mic/mixer setup. The software will mess with the audio settings and you'll have to go in and reset them.Otherwise, for the money, a good solution for someone who just wanted to record directly into their computer with no muss/no fuss."
2,Disappointing for Skype,"I bought this headset to use w/ Skype since I currently use a microphone and speakers, and all my friends complain about the echo effect. Although this headset took care of that problem my friends now said that my voice was muted and insisted that I speak up. I returned the headset to Amazon a couple of days later.On a positive note, the return went flawlessly and Amazon credited my credit card right away."
2,Not for Laptop Users,"I got Avaya RoadWarrior up and running on my computer to use when I work remotely. My co-worker told me to get a GN Netcom headset but I figured I'd save some money and get this one. Big mistake.There is a major problem with some laptops when the power cord is plugged in, the listener on the other end has what sounds like you in a an airplane during flight. The humming goes away when you unplug the power cord but that doesn't help me, I need to be able to use it when the power cord is plugged in or not.Anyway, I chatted with Plantronics support and then informed me that it's a known issue with no work around except to unplug the power cord while using it.So, it's getting returned."
3,Good functional product but my head is killing me,"The quality of the sound is excellent, volume controls are convenient, length of cable fine, etc; but the physical headset leaves a lot to desire for.Headset is uncomfortable, pointy, sharpie and not made thinking on the physical comfort of the user. Some of the issues are:1. The thin axle that holds left and right side together slips out and needs to be pushed back in coastally.2. The joint were the left and right halves divide in half again uses a screw for pivot that put pressure on the user's head (very painful).3. There is not way to go to Plantronics website and place a complain, or request some type of help from customer service for the product. I tired.If I could I would have it replaced because I need to have this thing on my head all the time and by end of business day I either have a headache or feel so light weighted that I feel could fly."
3,Nice sound and comfortable,"Initial unit purchased did not work properly. Replacement works fine but the rating is slightly affected for quality.What I like about the headset1. Good noise suppression2. Comfortable to use for extended periods3. Ease of installation. Works well with Skype and Cisco IP Communicator soft phone4. Price is a plusWhat I dislike about the headset1. Clunky cable and DSP 'wart'2. While its foldable, lugging it around with all the wire is a hassle3. USB cable is permanently attached to both the DSP and the headset. If it fails, you replace the entire unitI do recommend the unit if you need an affordable wired usb solution."
4,This thing rocks!,"I got this for a position I had taken working from home. The position didn't last (boring beyond belief) but the headset is awesome! The noise reduction, the software equalizer settings, the clarity are all excellent. My only problem with it is the flimsy design of the over the head area; it doesn't have anything to pop it into place so it tries to fold on your head.otherwise I love it!"
4,Ear pads,This is for the most part an excellent item. The only problem I have ever had is that the earpads wear out prematurely and are not replaceable.
2,Good audio output but compatibility issues,"The audio output was great... Computer detects it by itself when plugged in. But some real problems with compatibility. I could not use it with yahoo messanger for voice chat. I called customer care and they were not sure and adviced me to install the required codecs. I also noticed that when we are already playing some audio and then try plugging it in, some times it does not get detected and some times you can hear music on it but it would not mute the pc speaker. Strange !!! May be it should come with an instruction manual and a driver cd if needed. In any case I just returned it within 30 days."
4,nice headset for skype,This is a very nice headset for skype. I use it on Linux without a problem.The only cons are dealing with the really long cord and the sometimes uncomfortable hard plastic headpiece.
1,A $4.99 product,"I got this product hoping it is an easy plug and play one, but wait, it is not. When first plugged in, no sound at all, the worse part is that it muted my laptop speaker after I unplugged it, I have to google around and find out my only option is to uninstall laptop driver and restart computer in order to get back my laptop speaker.After a few computer restarts, I finally got it working. The voice has a poor quality, feels like somebody is speaking from a distance, and it is not comfortable for wearing over 20 minutes.If I can decide its price, I would label it as $4.99, it doesn't worth any more."
3,Not what I expected,"Okay, it works a little. This means that it came with no instruction manual on how to set things up. One must sort of do things trial and error. I still am working on this. If you are an average user, like me and not a computer Geek, go for something that has a manual, is plug and play and perhaps comes with an 8 year old to help you get it working!"
3,Cheaply made for the price,"I often use a headset with my PC for chats, recording and rosetta stone. I liked this headset a lot but the metel that holds the two pieces together bent and them the mic stopped working. the mute button never worked either."
3,Nice headset - if you get the new version...,"Updated 4/25/08 Plantronics has updated this headset. The ""bulge"" in the cord is now a much smaller device which makes the new version of the headset much better. I'd give the new version 4 stars. It's still a little bulky but it works great. This is our standard headset for folks using Cisco IP Communicator.This headset works great. The only problem is Plantronics missed the mark on what a folding headset is for. It comes with a boat anchor attached to the cord. This makes it hard to carry around. Good headset - yes. Portable - no."
4,More than I imagined,"This is intense information to keep my gifted 5th grader on the right track. The actual conversation tips are in the last half of the book, but the information leading up to that is just what I was looking for. This book lets you know where your 5th grader is or should be educationally and it shows and encourages you on how to be involved with his public education (Don't just sign and return his papers to school, really look at them). Our dinner table conversation is starting to flow..."
2,Great workout but belt broke,I enjoyed this workout but unfortunately the belt snapped and broke on my third use. I realize you can do it without the belt but I was really looking forward to the extra benefit of the belt. Had the belt not broken so quickly I would have given it more stars.
3,walk-at-home dvd,"the ad reads ""Walk Belt included Inside""There was NO walk belt included in the package.What a disappointment!It is shown on the DVD as an important part of the exercise.Why doesn't the Seller check the products he sends out before making this big error?"
4,"good music, easier on your body","I have to take back negative things i've said about her. I'm 52 and am having knee problems. Last year I said she didnt have enough moves in her workouts and recommended the firm, prevention, etc. Now from all those other moves, my knees bother me.She's good and definitely easier on the joints than the other."
4,A Nice Change of Pace,This is a nice change of pace for longtime fans of Leslie's workouts. The belt keeps it interesting and challenging. I prefer it to the stretchy band.
5,Time sure flies in this workout!,"I really enjoy this work out! It is very easy to follow, and the time literally flies so fast! The women in the video are ""real"" women, not your 20 somethings with perfect bodies. You actually feel like you are in the studio with them. At times Leslie gets a little giddy, that can be annoying , but I forgive her because I know I am getting a good workout. The belt really adds to power of the workout too. THis workout is great for the mature woman who does not want to jump around like a jack rabbit during her workout..Great video that I am going to enjoy for years!"
3,Not that special,"I was expecting some really creative and clever ideas. Instead, although nice looking, space saving and custom treatments, mostly I've seen before and are pretty traditional compared to what I had in mind."
4,Evolution,"The author was honest using words like, ""most likely"", ""must have happened this way"" and so on. He was consistent and did not contradict himself."
4,Couldn't put it down ...,"I had never heard of Cris Burks until my book club chose this book as a selection. This is a very emotional story of a young girl growing up in the least ideal situation. The story tugs at you heart and jerks your tears. But I loved every minute of it. Very realistic and somewhat relatable. Good read, Buy IT !!!!"
3,When Life Deals You Lemons....,I'm a sucker for happy endings and this one only left the hope for one...of course there'll be a sequel...there simply has to be...This is my first read by Cris Burks and if I see her name again I'll be sure to take a second look!!...I'm from Chicago and the memories were true and appreciated!!....
2,out of date book,This book is out of date re. modern RT techniques. The lymphoma fields are inaccurate and there are no involved fields shown. The first edition of the book was much better.
2,disappointing,"I bought the book in 1991 and was disappointed. The sample code is highly platform (DOS) dependent and not that useful as one might think. You can get at much better code from hundreds of maintained OpenSource projects.But worse than that, the interviews don't deserve that term. There is no question and answer pattern. A single page for each celebrity gives a short introduction and then just a few short statements, like ""A program should work flawlessly"" or ""Thinking back, I always hated FORTRAN, probably more than Cobol"". These won't help the readers to become better programmers.It's an outdated book that never lived up to its title and that I can't recommend to buy."
5,Son los mejores!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Este disco es demaciado arrecho, se los recomiendo su sonido es unico y me alegra muchisimo que c esten dando a conocer mas en el extranjero, ya que aqui tenemos muchisimos talentos y con muchisimas ganas de sacar al pais adelante, aunque lamentablemente estemos pasando por malos momentos, pero el Venezolano nunca se rinde, y el que quiere a su pais puede proponerse lo que quiera y lo lograra1 anyway este grupo es muy bueno y tambien les recomiendo a Tisuby & Georgina que ahora estan empesando a darse a conocer por mas paises y apoyen a los grupos Venezolanos!!!!!"
4,A good supplement for anitioxidants.,This product was recommended by health officials at an ayurvedic clinic I recently attended. Starting my day with one to two teaspoons of this tasty paste seems to give my energy a boost.
3,Amazon Listing Omits The Film Names,This set includes the first three Drive-In Discs:VOLUME 1The Screaming SkullThe Giant LeechesVOLUME 2The Wasp WomanThe Giant Gila MonsterVOLUME 3I Bury the LivingThe Hand
4,"Good novelisation, but some flaws.","Because she is writing a novelisation of the pilot, Diane Duane is limited in the extent of detail she can go into here. However, the book is a good print version of the episode, even thoough it does miss out most of the second act, and makes some major continuity errors (it was based on an early version of the script, with the names, etc, still provisional).For seaQuest fans, this is a must. It gives you a good insight into the ""future history"" background of the series, and delves deep into the character's pasts."
3,OK depending on what you cut,"You get what you pay for, the saw just dosen't work well enough for what I need it for it would be fine for soft stock but I was cutting very hard wood for inlays and needed an exact miter and a small kerf saw and this sort of looked like a less expensive solution to my problem. I did not want to spend a lot of money but as usual I should have known better I will get a setup that will last next time. The saw struggled to cut at all in hard wood.Don't' get me wrong, for something like balsa or other easily cut stock this is fine, the aluminum miter box seems accurate enough and you will get good results for something less demanding than tropical hardwoods. But if like me you actually want a lifelong tool this ain't it."
4,"All you need to know about modern dialects, but...","All you need to know about modern dialects you can find here. However, the chapter about Old Irish concentrates too much on the Common Celtic and Indo-European roots and too little on thesynchronic linguistics and grammar of Old Irish. The writer of that chapter probably takes for granted that his readers have studied the grammar of Old Irish at university. Of course, the book is a milestone in Irish-language writing about linguistics, and for myself the later chapters were a great introduction to Irish dialects."
3,Not as promised,I spent most of the day perfecting the installation. I tried every possible location and combination of locations. I get full bars for about 8 feet from the device. After 8 feet--nothing. Nothing close to the coverage promised.
3,most difficult installation,"This was a very difficult installation. The directions were poor, and it took me a lot of effort to get it working. I came very close to sending it back when I realized quite by accident that the antenna cable cannot be routed close to the base unit. Since the cable is attached to the bottom of the unit (mounted on a wall), it is natural to route the cable next to the unit since in most cases the antenna will be above the unit. That interferes with the signal, and the unit is erratic or non-functional. Routing the cable in a big loop finally solved the problem. Oddly enough mounting the unit upside down didn't work, maybe because it lowered the antenna a little. It is very sensitive to placement.The unit does work once installed correctly, but don't confuse 2,500 feet of coverage with 2,500 feet of living space unless your space is a circle around the unit."
2,Not much of a boost,I am not pleased with this Booster at all. Is to have 2500 square feet of coverage for my home. It has on ocassion boosted my signal in bedroom. This is not consistent nor does it boost service anywhere else throughout the house.
2,"stuffed Mater, cute and cuddly","I purchased this Mater for my grandson who is almost 2 yrs. old. He loves the movie but may be too young to make the connection to the stuffed toy. Consequently, he doesn't play with it at all.But, we set it out and when he makes the connection, it will be there."
5,This is one great little desk!,"This computer desk was everything I wanted: compact but functional, easy to put together, movable, sturdy and attractive. This desk fits all these criteria and more. The pieces are clearly marked for assembly, and appear to be very well made. It has a nice, solid feel without being bulky, and a clean, modern look. It is big enough to give you work space in addition to your computer, but still not take up too much room.This is one well designed desk, especially for the price. The upper shelf in high enough to fit a good sized monitor on the desk below, but not so high as to be difficult to access for a short person. The lower shelf is perfect for storing peripherals or a tower. While I expect the ""original price"" is way high, I could totally see this in a store for $100."
1,Total garbage!!,"Are you kidding me? The Catholic Mass is identical to the Black Mass? Last time I checked it was the Satan worshippers who were stealing the Consecrated Host(Jesus' Body), and then using it in their own mass to desecrate God. And anyone who knows Catholicism, nobody is ""worshipping"" the Blessed Virgin Mary, they are honoring her, as well as the Saints and Angels in Heaven with God our Father and His son Jesus. I guess having Heavenly Heros and Role Models are a bad thing, maybe it's better to stick to movie stars and athletes?Save your money. Don't buy this garbage."
1,More anti-Catholic drivel,"Catholics do not worship Mary, they honor her as Jesus' mother, in imitation of Christ who honors her as required by commandment along with Joseph. Catholics are very open about what they believe (CatholicAnswers), although many of the lay may do a poor job of explaining it, if one takes the time to learn and obviously this work has taken little time to learn the truth. There are no secret ceremonies or secret societies in the Catholic Church. To be sure the Catholic Church has issues with abuse by some clergy and its poor handling of that situation and rejecting these types in the seminary. It has also had a handful of popes who while keeping the apostolic doctrines straight, got carried away with themselves in their personal lives. But to attack Catholics as some black magic organization shows the ignorance that perpetuates into the 21st century all the way from the 1st century. I would give this work zero stars, but the lowest I can rate it is one."
1,Zyzzyx road movie,"The worst movie I ever experienced. Lousy on all counts.. Hated it! I would not recommend and so disappointing even the ending was hokey. My husband fell asleep. Wish I had not ordered this one, when there are much better acting and movies that have real content. The ending even sucked, although could not wait for it to be over."
2,"""Zzyzx"" Road, not ""Zyzzyx""","Why did they have to change the name? Zzyzx Road is at mile marker 239 on Interstate 15 just 7 miles southwest of Baker, California. Millions pass this on their way from southern California to Las Vegas. I always got a chuckle out of the name and bought the movie because of it. IMDB just says the movie was shot in the Mojave Desert. It could have been shot at the real Zzyzx Road but many remote exits on I-15 and I-40 in the Mojave look like that. This is a poor movie and much is shot in the dark. A motel room is supposed to be in Las Vegas but there are no Vegas scenes in the movie. I do not know why they had to change the spelling."
1,not good,"Over all just a bad movie. Horrible acting and bad picture picture quality. Dont wast your time or money on this, it should be free on prime not $3.99"
1,"If I could give this thing 5 NEGATIVE stars, I would.",Poor little Katherine! What sort of mess could you POSSIBLY have been in to need money this DESPERATELY? My heart goes out to you. The one star I gave is only there so that the bot would accept my review.
3,CHRISTMAS Fantasy,It was a good book to read on my new Kindle and at the busiest time of the year (CHRISTMAS)
5,Awesome read!,I could not put this book down! It was an awesome read from start to finish. I highly recommend this book.
4,Linksys SD205 10/100 Switch (5-port),The Linksys product has always been a good selection for my solutions however this little LAN hub surprised me when I discovered that it really is what I would call a four port becuase one of the ports you have to use for your input. So you can only connect four PC's with this model not five. But the product works great and love that it is so small!
1,Lightweight but ...,The headset is lightweight and sits in the ear nicely. The volume is also reasonable BUT (here's the big BUT!) I'm rather annoyed that people can hardly hear me at the other end! Don't waste your money on this - perhaps one of those with mic booms coming right to your mouth is still the better ones to go with.
2,Tried to save money as well...,"Simple to the point... Would not buy again. The hold downs look usable but very disappointed with the length (which I'm sure it was described... just over looked), thickness, and bolt size. I'm afraid it will not hold up like the one from Rockler that I have already. Picked these up to use in another location and first thing I'm going to do is to replace the small bolts. This is one of those... get what you paid for moments for me. See user pictures... plan on posting with side-by-side with the Rockler version."
5,Good Hold Down Clamp for T-Slot Tracks,I bought the Hold Down Clamp for my Drill Press Table that has a T-Slot Track in it. It works great and I am certain it will last as long as I do. Good Product and it works as advertised.Bill
1,Deceptive Advertising,"The description and picture represent the hold down clamp and the track bar as if they come together as a ""system"". In fact they are sold separately. Had I known, I would have been willing to purchase all the items that make up this ""system"" at the same time, now I am stuck with more freight charges and time delay. I sent a note to Grizzly and they responded the items are ""sold separately""."
2,underengineered product,"The DSP-100 has limited size adjustment and is poorly designed ergonomically. The headset plastic is flimsy and the set does not sit snugly or securely. The microphone does not extend far enough to clear the face or neck. Sound quality is adequate. Voices are recognizable, tone quality is acceptable."
1,Don't Buy,I purchased this for my son to play Half-Life online. It cuts out ALL the time. It supposedly has problems with Athlon based computers. I tried a fix (which must be done on a non-Athlon computer) but it didn't work. Wasted my money.
5,Just what we needed!,"This book is just what we needed at work. Simple, to the point and yet it gives clear and practical solutions for the issues of time management, ""paper"" and stress that we all talk about in the lunch room. I loved the section on ergonomics and ""eyebreaks."" I've never seen that before in a business book. Most of the other books I've seen on the subject of time management are so overloaded with information, that I don't have the time to read them! This book even tells you how to read it so that you get the most out of it. I used the speed reading techniques on the book -- just as it recommended -- and found stuff I could put to immediate use. I highly recommend the book to anyone who wishes they had more hours in the day to get things done."
3,Hammer drill is a battery hog,"Overall a pretty good drill, the pistol grip fit is very comfortable. The 14.4 volt makes the drill lightweight. I bought a 18v and returned it due to being too heavy to hold and drill at the same time. ONLY drawback is the hammer drill. It will drill a hole in concrete like a mad man. Once the hole has been drilled, go ahead and replace the dead battery. You can basically get ""maybe"" 2 holes drilled before changing batteries. Not sure because it's a 14.4 volt( where is the .4 volt)that drains the battery so quickly."
5,This hits home-probably with all of us,"What a celebration of Christmas and the love felt by older folks. It's Like ""Timothy Cratchit's Christmas Carol, 1917"" (which I had never heard of until I saw it on Amazon) in which it describes the love the elderly have for their children. Mr. Hegg, this is a gem"
3,A very short (for Proust) essay,"A very short (for Proust) essay on why we read, why it is important to read, and why those of us who read find it really annoying when those of you who AREN'T reading interrupt us when we ARE reading. It was worth reading just to find that passage, for me"
3,the title was the give-away...,"as to what awaited you when you started playing the album.Metal with a heart,aww,that's precious.Especially with Udo's vocal stylings...yecch.Well actually the title cut is pretty good.This is where the downward slide began for Accept."
5,what a voice for the years,"this cd really brings out the best of narvel felts. having been raised listening to him, i must say that this cd is truly a great collection of his hits. from original songs to ones he has borrowed throughout the years, he belts out tunes from drift away to somebody hold me in a way that only narvel can do. being a native of southeast missouri, i sincerely appreciate the artistic talent that narvel posseses. this cd is definitely one to add to your collection."
5,Complicated PR: A thing of the past,"This is a fantastic do-it-yourself guide to public relations. I didn't see myself as the ""for dummies"" kind of person until i read this book. The book covers topics including change management, communication, marketing and issues management and makes them look easy. A must have for anyone wanting to know more about PR."
3,PR Kit ed. 1,I thought I ordered the second edition but got the first. The first is acceptable but six years behind the second.
5,A book that kept me up reading through out the nights.,"I had already known Reggie was a man of God but the story of his life really made me proud that the Packers have him.God has a man in Sports that can sure show the unbelievers that he is alive.This book made me laugh and brought tears about how a father I should be. And it gave me a differant look on Buddy Ryan. Also this past weekend I wondered if Reggie was talking about the Lord to the other lineman, while they were talking trash. It's a great book,now my 12 year old son is reading it."
5,Great Book,"really awesome book, cool pics in the middle!! exciting life to read about. im a big GB fan, ad was sad when he retired, but am constantly impressed by his faith. God bless Reggie!!PS im glad u finally got a superbowl !!!"
3,back for seconds huh,keith sweat's playing out and johnny gill's a hasbeen they had no choice but to gewt back with gerald levert for this sophmore cd well another reasomn why old singers should get out the way hear new edition's coming back why? bbd made another cd which flopped last year or so.
1,is not the disc i've order,"different cover, old version & 1st version tracking list. it's not the disc i've ordered. bad purchase, the first on amazon after 15 years"
2,Too much garbage,"Kessler ruined a decent story line with a bunch of garbage that had nothing to do with the story. I don't need a lecture on how gays, blacks and females are just people. Say they're gay, black or female and get on with the story.Then he decides to throw in perverted sex scenes that again have nothing to do with the story. I'm not talking about the intimidation scenes or the blatant disregard for the female officer's rank. They might have been sexual in nature, but the two I remember weren't particularly deviant.The female lead is a joke. She couldn't detect her way out of a wet sack. While I understand the traitor sold out his country for money because he needed it, the backstory wasn't particularly believeable.Don't waste your money on this one. If you want to read Kessler, try ""Brainstorm""."
1,You call 10 minutes realistic,"First, the video is only 10 minutes. Honestly, is that a realistic childbirth? Yeah, I don't think so! Second, I ordered this tape to show to my high school health class. Well, there wasn't even a placenta in the video. Yet, the past reviews go on and on about how natural the video was. Sorry, but 10 minutes worth a childbirth does not even come close to the reality of the event. I do not think the video is a good educational tool to illustrate an entire Birth Day."
1,Trite stereotyping,"The haiku in this book is mediocre at best. But what's offensive are the the subject matters. Themes of all these poems are so typical of what gays are supposed to do and think--shopping, vicious gossip, etc. There is no depth, no sophistication. Half way through (and I read the whole book) I was exhausted by the usual queer bitchiness. Don't buy this book."
4,"Carries the wheel fine, but needs a lock!","The Wheel-On carrier is a helpful purchase if you don't like throwing a muddy bicycle wheel in your car after a couple hours on trails. It fits my 29 inch wheel well and it doesn't spin while driving. It fits on my Aeroblade rack fine, and appears to have a fairly universal clamping system. The big problem as others have noted is the complete lack of any locking ability. It uses a basic clamp with wing nuts to fit around the bar so the carrier itself would take all of 30 seconds to steal. The wheel also cannot be locked to the carrier aside from tightening down the quick release mechanism. The only option is to use a cable lock looped through the spokes and around your rack which looks a bit cheesy. It works, but a factory fit lock would be a nice change."
4,"Good, but flawed","I bought the 593 wheel-on rooftop carrier based mostly on reviews I read here on Amazon. While it is a quality unit that works well, I do wish the mounting screws/nuts were hidden once mounted, much like the Echelon bike carrier they make. This unit can easily be stolen as is. The other issue is the locking screw for the arms doesn't really LOCK it into either the vertical or horizontal (storage) position, it can still be pushed down/up with little force. Aside from these gripes, I really like the 593, I just hope it sticks around long enough for me to enjoy it!"
5,Epson Picturemate Print 270-T5570,"I like getting the bigger package for my printer. Always have bought it this way, T5570-270 I would like to be able to get this in the future. Great company Epson."
4,Check the date,The Epson Print Pack is a good deal. The only issue I have is a previous pack I purchased had a Best When Used By date of less than a month from purchase. I would suggest you check the date immediately upon receiving your order.
5,"Good price, quick delivery",The price was the best I found and it was delivered in just 5 days. No problems.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,I ordered this and received a package with an old expiration date. I wrote to amazon.com and they sent me a replacement- and ANOTHER defective package. I STILL have not received my refund!I only gave it 1 star because they made me- otherwise it would be ZERO.
1,Not for PictureMate DASH,"This product was offered by Amazon as a recommended buy for the Epson PictureMate Personal Photo Lab Dash PM 260--but they are the wrong cartridges. Don't buy for the 200 series. I found out the hard way--after I opened the package. Uggh! No one wants to replace--not Amazon, not Epson. What a waste."
1,Doesn't Work with Picturemate Snap,The ink cartridge does not fit the Epson picturemate snap so had to send it back. The other epson print packs work very well - 5 stars.
2,Kind of disjointed,"I am a huge Buffy fan I have read many of the books. I really did not enjoy this novel. It was boring, disjointed, and confusing. The characters never developed and the plot jumped back and forth too much. I would not recommend it since there are so many novels that are better in the Buffy series. Only for the true fan that wants to read every book."
3,not the greatest buffy book,buffy is at about at wit's end. slaying occupies most of her waking hours but now she is dreaming about it. as it turns out her dreams have to deal with her old nemesis the master. he istrying to rewrite history back to the time where he was trappedin the alternate dimension. he wants to succeed this time andbring the acopalise to earth. can buffy and crew stop him in time? tune in to see.
5,It went into the characters and gave them a past.,"This book was excellent. I have read every Buffy book up to date, and this was one of my Favorites. Also I enjoyed Child of the hunt very much. The reason I enjoyed Night of the Living Rerun because it showed the characters from a diffrent point of view. This book went into their pasts and showed them together. I think my favorite part of the whole book was when throughout the whole book Willow wasn't having any dreams like the others, and then at the very end of the book Willow has a dream that puts her and Xander together in the past. I think that that was an excellent ending to the book, and it was an exellent book. I have gone back and read it two more times. Out of all the books this one is my favorite, because of history it brings out, also I now know alot more about the Salem witch trials then I did before. I love the movie, I love the show, and I love the books, I'm obssed with BtVS!"
3,Works.,"This is nothing fancy, and we've never even used the timer, but the volume levels are good and it works pretty well. I only gave it 3 stars because it shorts out (or something) every once in a while - the volume gets really low and it doesn't respond to the volume knob - but I just turn it off and back on again and it is fine. We've been using it steadily for over 2 years and it still works!"
3,"Light and Compact, but poor sound quality","THis is a compact and light background noise maker, but I was looking for something with more of just a plain white noise sound, similar to running a fan. I thought most of the sounds sounded like a staticy Tv, and I find that just downright annoying."
1,Piece of junk,We had 2 of these and both had the same problem; shorting of the volume knob and it stopped working. We bought it because my bro & sis-in-law had one for their baby. Their's shorted out also. Need I say more.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I have owned three noise machines over the years and this one is by far the worst. It started to short out after using it for less than 6 months. We've managed to fiddle with it and keep it working, but it's a huge pain in the a**. Very unreliable."
2,Short Life,"Sounds good, but ours died within a year of nightly use (plugged in), as did one purchased by a friend. Feels light and cheap.We replaced with the DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01 and have been very happy for only a few dollars more."
1,Had 2 and both broke in less than 6 months,"I got two for my new twins. Both stopped working in the first six months. Those nights were disasters. Poor manufacturing. Time to splurge on a better model since clearly this isn't as good as it used to be. While it was working, we loved it. 5 and 6 months is just not an acceptable lifespan."
2,bad switch,"I liked the different choices of sounds on this, but the on/off/volume switch started shorting out soon after we got it. We can barely keep it going now."
3,Started making weird noise.....,"I bought this item a long time ago and I hardly used it until I had a baby. I started to use it in my daughter's room when we were traveling, and it worked fine. A few times later, it started to make a weird noise, that is not part of the sound options, it sounds like its just on its last leg. I felt that it was old so I ordered another one. So we'll see if it'll last or I have to buy another quality one."
1,I have not received the product to order and pay.,"So far I have not received the product that I pay and you spent more than 15 days from the due date, I need a solution."
1,sound Spa review,"I found this a nonsense product suitable for a young teenage girl, who I am not. Will be giving it away."
1,Why can't it be shipped to Australia?,I would like to purchase this item but they do not ship to Australia. WHY?
2,The sound blanks out,"I like noise machines, but after about 1 month the sound started turning off for no reason. Sometimes it would go back on, and sometimes it would stay off. My sister bought one and it does the same thing. I called Homedics and they told me they'd never heard of the problem (I'm finding that hard to believe) and that if I paid to ship it to them then they would send me a new one in 4-6 weeks. So...I have to pay for it, and I'd be without a sound machine for my baby for a couple months...not very helpful. I don't recommend buying this because this seems to be a common problem."
2,Great while it lasted . . .,"Like many other reviews, I thought it was great while it lasted! After 5-6 months, it shorted out and now it only works every so often. I would rather spend more money for something that was going to last a bit longer!"
2,"Great sound, but doesn't last long","At fist the HoMedics worked great. There are many sounds to choose from, and they are all quite pleasant. However, within 3-4 months the sound would cut out - almost as if there was a temporary loss of power, only there wasn't. We tried unplugging it to reset it, and that helped for awhile. But it gradually got worse. Last night it would run for 1/2 hour and then turn off and stay off. I tried unplugging it, and it started up again but then turned off and stayed off after a 1/2 hour or so. It's officially not working anymore and we are now looking for a new brand."
1,Doesn't last,"Like a number of the other reviewers, I would not recommend this product. The volume knob stopped working after a few months, resulting in the sound cutting off immediately or within a short period. I'm now looking for a different, more reliable, brand."
2,Sound shorts out,"We purchased 4 of these for the 4 bedrooms that are used in our house and within a year or so the sound has shorted out on all of them. The sound is very finicky and will shut off, yet the unit is still on. Adjusting the volume causes the sound to cut in and out and crackle. Not very high quality."
3,Do NOT buy if you want ocean sounds!,I bought this for traveling so I could sleep better in strange hotel rooms. It is very portable and works well off 4 AA batteries. The rain and waterfall sounds are the only ones I can use for sleep. The ocean sound track is a HUGE disappointment - it has seagulls shrieking in the background which I find impossible to fall asleep to.
5,teriffic!,"I recently bought this but so far it works great. I use it for my 9 month old son when he's sleeping and it does the trick. None of the sounds are annoying like some machines have and there is a good variety to choose from. Plus all of the sounds are very realistic, I even enjoy listening to them. I also love that it has a cord you can plug in or put batteries in it."
1,only lasted 4 months,"I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. Their rooms are right next to each other and I was worried that with the birth of our 2nd son, that they would disturb each other's sleep. When I first got the product, I was pleased with it. Lots of sound options, good sound quality, adjustable volume, and timer. BUT with constant overnight use of both machines, they both petered out within 4 mths of initial use. One of the machines volume doesn't work properly. The other machine doesn't turn on unless I push random buttons. It seems as though both of them has a loose wire somewhere preventing normal function. This product would probably be ok for occasional use, but I don't recommend for regular use."
1,Like other negatives have said...,"The thing shorts out, and the noise will unexpectedly turn off, and then come back on, or not turn on at all. While it worked, it was great, but it didn't take it long at all to start shorting out. I am going to look for a similar item that doesn't have this problem. After having it for about 6 months, I'm fed up."
1,shorts out quickly,"we have this exact model and I don't recommend buying at least this particular brand. Ours started to short out within a few months of using it although we too could make it work, after having it less than a year, it's now completely out and won't play at all. I will buy a different brand next time, definitely there are flaws in this one."
4,Good,For the price this item is good. You can pay a fortune for sound machines. This machine has nice basic sounds that work.
2,Shorts out,"It's a great little noise machine, but ours have always become faulty - shorted out - required banging on them or tweaking the knob just the right way to make it work...that's a pain. And it's too bad."
3,Great for the price,"We have 3 of these - one for each of our kids. It has a great loud white noise sound (waterfall) and travels beautifully. The two major drawbacks, though, and the reasons I'll be replacing them for something different: 1) after a year or so of use, it functions poorly - cutting in and out at times, 2) in a power outage, the sound machine goes out but then when the power comes back on, it goes back on to its default - chirping birds! So we're desperately running around trying to flip it back to waterfall so our kids don't wake up. I've finally found a machine now that reverts to battery when the power goes out (often in our neck of the woods) - Sound Oasis sound therapy - it's more expensive, but worth it, I think. But overall, the Homedics is a great machine for the price if your power doesn't go out often :)"
4,Good value for the money,I agree with what's been said before. It's a good value for the money. The ocean and waterfall sounds are my favorite. The heartbeat is a bit odd. I'm happy with my purchase.
1,Could have been great...not great quality,"We have two of these and they worked for a while. However, both are shorting out and the sound comes and goes. Very poor quality."
2,Won't last long,"The sound quality is pretty good for this machine but it has a tendency to short out after some usage. The first time it did this I thought it was a fluke and I bought another one. However, after using the same model for a little while it started to short out again. You can play with the knob and get it too work but it eventually stops working. I have to replace it again but I will not buy this brand again"
2,Too quiet,"This is a nice product if you just need a small amount of white noise to block out sound or just want some soothing background noise. It also is small enough to travel well. However, I specifically bought two machines to put in each of my children's rooms...the sound is way too quiet to block out the amount of noise I need it to. I was actually amazed at how quiet the lowest volume setting was--it wasn't audible!"
1,Enjoy it while it lasts,Owned this item for 6 months then it started shorting out and would only play at obnoxiously loud volumes. Not worth the money.
2,Screeching Seagulls,I bought this product looking for the sound of the ocean so I could drown out my mans snooring. The ocean sound on this machine includes the sounds of a screeching seagul. The same sound bytes are on a quick loop so it is pretty often that you have to hear it. Anytime I have slept near the ocean at night you only hear the roar of the ocean..not the seaguls. It is very annoying. The heartbeat is kind of creepy and the waterfall noise sounds like toilet flushing and flushing... The white noise is the only useful sound. Wish I knew about the seaguls before I bought this. Anyone know of a sound machine that has the ocean without the birds?
1,Not relaxing,"I bought another version of this sound machine a few years back and it worked great for a while. Then it started making loud buzzing noises every once in while (when I was trying to sleep). I figured I had worn it out since I used it every night, all night, while I was sleeping. So I decided to buy another one. This one made the same loud buzzing noise the second night I used it."
1,Shorts out,It worked fine in the beginning but then it started shorting out after only a couple of months of usage. Poor quality product. I recommend purchasing a different brand.
1,HORRIBLE MACHINE,"This thing is a piece of junk. It completely breaks after a few months. If you stay on top of your receipt, you can continue to return it and get another one provided that it breaks within the time they allow for returns. Don't be fooled, it breaks slowly. One day, the knob will have to be wiggled to keep it on, the next week, you have to apply more pressure; by the end of the month, it doesn't turn on at all. Find a better sound machine. I'm still looking. Brookstone is expensive, but tends to have higher-end products."
2,Electrical shortage,"We bought this at KMart 2 years ago. After 6 months, you'd have to wiggle the volume knob to make it work, it would automatically shut off, as though there was an electrical short. I had my receipt and considered returning it for a replacement, but that was $4.95 -- just the principal that I had to pay more b/c their product stunk. Anyway, it finally died a few months ago. Now I'm on the hunt for another sound soother. I will avoid Homedics products. This is their 2nd sound soother that's died on me (I had the CD player/sound soother and it also got an electrical short that made it always default to the CD player)"
1,Faulty,"The sounds in this machine are average, but the main issue is that there are bad connections inside, and the sounds will just stop dead... or worse, stop and start intermittently. We bought it for our baby, but it just startles her."
1,Raspy sounding!,A sound machine is supposed to be soothing right? Every sound on this machine sounds raspy and harsh. I have been using a sound machine for years from Sharper Image but I recently left it in a hotel room never to be seen again. The sounds for the Sharper Image model were quite realistic and relaxing. Pass on the homemedics.
5,Sounds of a good night sleep,I got the HoMedics sound machine at the recommedation of my doctor. I suffer from tinnuitus and had a hard time falling asleep. Now I listen to the rainfall or the ocean waves and it's so relaxing. Wonder device for anyone with has trouble sleeping or just likes to listen to the rain.
2,Broke after less than a year,"We bought two of these for my children's rooms. After less than a year of use, both on/off knobs have started malfunctioning. One of the machines won't turn on at all anymore. I was pleased at first, but the quality and durability is clearly poor. I would not recommend buying this."
2,Obnoxious sound looping and low quality hardware,"The volume knob quickly broke such that you have to fiddle with it to get the sound to work. Every time you adjust it, it cuts in and out.If you only like white noise and/or the heartbeat sound, you probably will be ok with this machine. The other sounds are looped recordings that only last a couple of seconds, and click at the repeat because they are not ""tiled"". They contain unique standouts that repeat so often you can't help but tune into it. It would be great if someone made a machine like this that didn't repeat every 2 or 3 seconds! If you made it 15 minutes before repeats (and start at a random place when initializing) then nobody would notice or care. A few seconds of the rainforest for example sounds like this:-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep-clickcheep!cheepcheep!cheep"
1,HoMedics Spa shorts out--don't waste your $!,"We bought these for each of our kids' room. They were okay for a couple of months, but they all started shorting out--the sounds come in and out, at varying volumes from zero to VERY LOUD! My oldest child told me that it was actually waking her up. The same seems to happen with our baby. I've heard all of the machines do this. And, they don't start the first time I turn them on. I have to turn it on twice to get sounds. It's worse than having no sleep machines!"
4,great item,I bought this for my infant daughter as a white noise machine. She had a bear that played a heartbeat and would fall asleep easily....then the bear broke and I found myself ordering this on my iPhone with one day shipping. Totally worth it! The batteries last for a long time on it and she sleeps soundly. The only thing I don't like is the heartbeat noise...it's kinda creepy so we don't use that one.
1,replace often,"I just purchased the 2nd one of these. The first and now the 2nd after just a day or use, has an annoying pitched background noise that is under the white noise. It's almost like something is loose and vibrating within the machine as I can press on the speaker and get it to stop, which isn't so convenient. I'll be returning the 2nd one and finding another product. I figured the 2nd would eventually go out like the 1st, but thought it would last longer than a day!"
3,Not my speed,The sounds are great on this cost effective machine... It's just that the tempo is just a bit too fast to be relaxing for me.
3,Shorts Out,"I've had this for six months and it barely works. It shorts out and we can coerce it to work after a lot of effort. It did help my daughter sleep. For some reason, the sound is REALLY loud. We have always had to muffle the noise with a blanket over it. My sister recommended this, and hers isn't like that at all."
4,Works Great,"I have been using this machine for a couple of months now and am very happy with it. There are only six different sounds available, but I really only listen to one or two of them, anyway. I like the crickets sound and the waterfall. I also like the rain sound, but it rains a lot where I live so I don't usually listen to that one. The heartbeat is creepy and I never listen to that, but someone might like it, maybe small babies?The unit is durable enough and runs on either batteries or a plug-in.The only downside is that the crickets sound is a loop that feels too short. In other words, I wish they had recorded maybe 8 seconds of sound instead of 3 seconds, because it ends up sounding a little fast or fake after listening to it for a while. By that time I'm half-asleep anyway so it shouldn't matter, and it's just a minor thing, but if you know what crickets sound like, you might notice it too.Recommended."
2,Not microwave safe,I got these because I like KitchenAid products. They are sturdy and heavy plastic. It never occurred to me that they were not microwave safe. They are so NOT. Three minutes and a hole in the bottom of the small bowl. There should be a warning on the bottom of the bowls that alerts you to NOT put these in the microwave.
2,Not very durable,"I received these bowls as a gift for Xmas '08, and have already had to toss 2 of them due to cracks in the bottom. We use these bowls about 4-5 times a week for dinner preparations. We have never used them in the microwave or dishwasher, always washing by hand. After less than 2 months of use, the smallest bowl cracked at the bottom and ""spidered"" out up the bowl. Then a few weeks later, the exact same thing happened to the medium bowl. We have done nothing excessive to these bowls to make them crack, but they are just not strong enough for routine use. I had to pull the $10 set I got from Wal-Mart out of retirement. I have a lot of KitchenAid products and really like the brand, but these bowls are just not strong enough."
3,Okay...,I typically love Oprah book club books but this one was only okay for me. I didn't think the story line was very strong and it was very predictable.
4,Good book,Well written book. Schwarz does a good job of describing the relationship between these two sister. Her descriptions of the areas where the novel takes place are excellent.
2,Would benefit from some subtlety,"While it's not a terrible story, I was greatly disappointed in the author's execution. This story gives far too much away, far too early. There were many ""revelations"" in this book, and I can't think of any that truly surprised me. Foreshadowing is a great tool for an author when used well, but it was far too obvious here.I was also disappointed in the characters; they're very flat. For example, Amanda's motives are there, but they're not subtle in any way, and they don't provide you with a real look inside her head."
4,"I could not put this book down, it is such a great story!",I read this book for the first time a little over a year ago and it is still my favorite book of all time. I read the whole book in about 3 days which is a record for me. The story is very simple and touching. I never expected how it would end until right at the last page and when I read it the tears began to fall. This would be a great book for several different age groups also. I hope you get this book and enjoy it as much as I do.
2,Annoying,"The first chapter of this book was great, but then it was quickly downhill. Complaints: the weirdness and dysfunction far outweighed the ""crime"" as *finally* revealed at the end; there is a familiarity in this book in tone, setting, and dysfunction to other books I've read lately -- the turn-of-the century, crazy sister who is made crazy because everyone ignores her because she is weird, ugly, plain, or too smart genre -- give it a rest; long stretches of this book are very clunky and suffer too much from first-novelitis; it just takes too long both in literal reading time and novel-time for the final ""truths"" to be made apparent to everyone; the unrelenting grimness of this book is a success on one level (in the ability to maintain tone) but doesn't make for an uplifting, insightful or entertaining read. I was most disappointed in this book. Parts of it are superb, but not nearly enough to carry its weight."
4,Intriguing,"This deceptively simplistic book is the story of secrets kept and the far-reaching effect they have on the person who perpetuates them. I found the characterizations to be well done. At the end of this novel, the reader has a good comprehension of their motives, their insecurities and their hearts. I look forward to more insightful books from Christina Schwarz."
1,Come on Oprah you can do better,"I know I am the voice of dissent but I was truly disappointed by this book. I had to force myself to finish it. It was predictable, the character development was poor, and it was very unrealistic. It is promoted as a mystery and of insight into family secrets but I found it neither. I know the ending after the first three chapters. If you must read it at least wait until paperback...."
2,Tedious,"This book was SO boring. The time frame kept switching back & forth. The descriptions and details were so in depth as to be tedious... Characters came and went without any feeling of attachment or familiarity.. And I kept waiting for something to hold my attention. I wouldnt recommend - the title is meant to grab your attention, but the story is disappointing overall."
2,Disappointment to the fullest!,"I have read many books from Oprahs book club over the past few years, and I have never been let down until now. This book reminded me of something that could be found on the shelf at the supermarket. It jumped around way too much and it was unnessarily cheesy and predictable. I hope Christina Schwartz more luck in writing her next book. I only reccomend this book to people who thrive on daytime soap operas."
1,wish I'd never purchased this book,Badly written and dull. Not sure I will even be able to finish it. The author has no gift or skill at telling a story and making characters interesting. Consequently the reader (ME) just does not care. Wish I could return it for something more engaging. Oprah's book club ? Must have read this when she decided to give up her syndicated show and start her own network - not her best decisions !
3,Middle of the Road,"Well, this story is just good enough to keep you reading. But not good enough to recommend to friends. It's one of those true ""Middle of the Road"" types of books...I didn't dislike it, but it certainly didn't keep me up nights turning pages. It's sort of like catching one of those Sunday afternoon movies that ropes you in, but in its entirety isn't really all that great. The characters are vividly portrayed, the story line is indeed interesting, but when I snapped the book shut at the end, I didn't feel the satisfaction that comes with having read a really good book."
3,Drowning ruth,Interesting but a little predictable. Shows life in a somewhat deserted area of the US. Also before technology and how it has affected us iN every way.
3,Sad book,"This was a fairly good read, but the characters seemed cold. I realize that stories need a meaning, but the secrets here just go on hurting people. No one seems to ""wake up"" in time to stop the carnage. It left me feeling sad."
4,Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book. I was at first a bit confused with the writing style, but the more I read it, I caught on and by the end of the book I was singing praises of the style. This is a story I couldn't put down. For me, the more I think back over the story, the more I appreciate it. I highly recommend this book."
2,JUST SAY NO!,"I picked up this book a month ago. Suggestion from a friend. By the time i started reading the book, I was going through a reading phase...you could say. Reading a book a day for the summer months. A month later...I am still reading this book. Sure, I have read other books during the month...I just can't seem to finish this book. It's more of chore than anything else. I have 70 pages left of it...and have vowed not to read another book until I finish this book. And it's killing me.It's slow.Too quiet.THE SILENCE!I am giving it two stars (and not one) only because I have lived with the characters so long...they are kind of like family now. You know...how you love your sisters but don't like them.Just stay away from this book."
5,"A story that grabs you, and you can't let go until the end.","I read this book in two days since I couldn't put it down. It has been a long time since I have read a book that was so easy to get involved in, that sucked you in to the plot and kept you there...the ending was just as good as the entire book. This book just does not let you down!"
5,fantastic!,"Schwartz has written an astonishing novel. It's suspenseful, complex, provocative and heartbreaking. At one admirable, pitiful and enraging, Amanda is one of the most multi-faceted characters I've encountered in fiction. The setting could not be more stunningly captured. I couldn't put this book down."
5,Love Jill Mansell,"Wonderful characters,whose stories are well-written and make you care about them. Great read for Chick Lit lovers. A page turner that I couldn't put down. (I refuse to recognize ""unputdownable"" as a word.)"
4,Fun Summer Read,"I have read a few of Jill Mansell's books and this one so far was my favorite. This one had me turning the pages trying to find out what was happening next. If you enjoy drama and scandal in a book, then you'll enjoy this one."
4,Happy read,"This is a sweet, laugh out loud ..sorry I have to use the word ""romp"" cause it id. If you want to have some relief from your world go to Loretta's."
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars,"I read a LOT. I love historical romances and in my nearly 20 years of reading them I have never not finished a book...until now. ""Viscount Vagabond"" is AWFUL. Literally nothing happens. NOTHING. There's no romance, I can't understand why this man would help some pale, fragile governess and take her to his sister's home and then all of a sudden she runs away, and he searches for this stranger for days and days, yeah right. In the rare conversations they have, she is a preachy, boring, prudish, dull idiot. He atleast has some personality, but he seems to always be trying to stifle it b/c it overwhelms her delicate sensibilities. Everytime I expected something to happen it just didn't. This was my first Loretta Chase book and most likely my last. I only made it as far into the book as i did by skimming through. I can only recommend this book if you have insomnia and are dying for a way to fall asleep."
3,"This is a pamphlet, not a book.","I was too hasty in ordering to see that there's only 64 pages in this ""book"" in the product description. There are very few fermentation recipes. A majority of the recipes are what you can make with your sauerkraut after it's done fermenting.I already have Nourishing Traditions and Wild Fermentation, two books with much more information and many more recipes. I was disappointed with this book as I didn't read anything that I already didn't know. What was in here is good info if you don't have either of the two books (which I highly recommend you make a space for in your collection). So the quality is good, it's the quantity to price ratio that is lacking as it's nothing you couldn't find in web articles, recipe sites or Youtube videos."
3,Simple But Straight Forward,This book is very basic but useful. I'll be buying another book on fermenting foods since it does not cover everything I'm looking for.
5,Sigh!,"I have read all of Amanda Ashley's vampire romance books and have enjoyed every of them. When I bought the first one, I wasn't sure I would like vampire romance, but I was happily surprised. I just finished reading ""A Darker Dream"" and loved every minute of it. Rayven swept me off my feet. Please keep writing them, Ms. Ashley."
1,so frustrating,"I really wanted to like this book but I was so frustrated by the wooden, one-dimensional characters. Amy, the elephant, is an interesting subject; however, slogging through this poorly written story to learn about her just isn't worth it."
4,Excellent,Excellent book! One of those you can curl up with on a Sunday and read the whole thing without putting it down.
1,Apologist for murderers,"Another book written seeking to find reasons for IRA terrorists planting bombs in public places ie Oxford Street Bus Depot,La Mon House Restaurant,Enniskillen Rememberance Day,Shankill Fish Shop.This seems to be a book that gives excuses for murder,torture,maiming and hate."
1,Great Book But Don't Buy the Kindle Version,This book is a must read for those interested in African History. Don't buy the Kindle version because its full of OCR generated errors which makes it almost impossible to read. Amazon should not sell it in this format because the presentation ruins a great book.Buy a second hand copy and you won't be disappointed. I did and rate it 4 stars.
1,rip off,"My grandmother got this for my daughter and I'm afraid she was ripped off. It worked once or twice the first day, but would not work the second day. It turns on and off but freezes immediately. I tried to find a number to call for help in the user manual but there is none. I looked up the company listed on the back - Innovage - and found an address but there but no number listed. The box has a price - $89 - crossed off. I'd say it's worth about $5. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,worse bag ever,so cheaply made!! it fell apart shortly after i bought it. no room for anything... this purse was totally useless
1,Don't buy,Just a piece of metal? I thought it was supposed to go on a bracelet at least... Either way you can't read the writing at all.
3,wait till $10-15,not much for me to say as the other gamers already pointed everything out.wait until the game is in the bargain bin for $10-15
4,Loving Girlfriend,"I bought this game for my boyfriend, and he really has seemed to enjoy it! He loves racing, and he has mentioned that it is quite fun racing game to play. Very good purchase!"
4,Solid Arcade Type Rally Game from Sega,"Good solid arcade type game, not as sim-like as Dirt, but a lot of fun nonetheless. If you were a fan of Sega Rally 2 on the Dreamcast, then this game is for you. Also has a decent selection of cars to choose from."
3,HW cool - software is buggy as hell,"player HW - 5 starsplayer firmware - 4 starsPlayCenter (the PC SW component to send music files to the player) - negative 5 stars. This is an extremely badly designed piece of garbage that is full of bugs. Whoever is responsible for the design, coding, testing and management of this crime against humanity needs a few strong kicks in the balls.With a decent PlayCenter SW component this would be a 5 star product. As it is it's 3 and I'm generous."
2,Not ready for prime time,"This unit has no stop button, so it constantly tries to pickup from where it left off. For some reason, this creates all sorts of problems. At least, that is what Creative's tech support told me. They suggested that I wait till the next firmware release and see if that fixes the problems or buy the ... remote, which provides a stop button. Unfortunately, the remote is not available anywhere. I was disappointed."
1,Wish I would have got an IPOD,Okay what a dissapointment. After spending a bunch of money on this thing it doesn't work. The software it came with really screwed up my computer and the player itself is too thick and the headphones become distorted after continuous use. Overall I would not recommend.
4,Kindred Spirit Found in the Power of Branding!,"What a find! I have been searching for a kindred spirit in the power of branding. And now I have found a kindred spirit in Peter Montoya. Peter not only shares, he promotes the belief that people, not the products and services, produce effective branding! And Peter with Tim Vandehey have written a ""world class"" primer that I believe is a must read for business owners and professionals who want to realize the power of branding. I strongly recommend the purchase and reading of this book and then putting its advice to work to Brand YOU!Reviewed by: J. Glenn Ebersole, Jr., Founder & Chief Executive, J. G. EBERSOLE ASSOCIATES and THE RENAISSANCE GROUP (tm), Lancaster, PA. and Author of ""Glenn's Guiding Lines - Thoughts From Your Strategic Thinking Coach"" newsletter www.renaissanceman4u.com"
3,"Oh, ya!","A ""yooper"" is a person from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. ""Da Yoopers"" is a comedy group from the same region. Most of their material is focused on things like hunting, fishing and drinking. This particular CD is a compilation album of some of their most popular tracks. The CD opens with their most popular song of all, the classic ""Second Week of Deer Camp"". 21 more tracks of similar material follows that, most of which is pretty funny. If you like ""Second Week of Deer Camp"", and you want to hear more of what Da Yoopers have to offer, you might want to get this CD."
4,Good and Bad -- They're All Right About This Cheeky Story,"Face it, you've got to be in a certain frame of mind to read a book where you're supposed to root for a serial killer. After a bad week at work, I was in exactly the right frame of mind... perhaps even sympathetic. The main characters aren't finely drawn -- it's as if the author or editor chopped off the usual introductory first chapter. But who cares? It's a light, mischievious read. Enjoy!"
2,We know who dunnit,"No mystery here about who did it, and kept doing it -- Lovesey tells us from the beginning it was the Rev. And we always know who the next victim will be. But why?? He didn't like getting caned at school so he simply must have his luxuries one day a week -- which means stealing -- which means knocking off anyone who wants to check the church financial books.... Besides, with the price of gas for boats, it takes more than stealing the cash from the local bake sales. And talk about dopey women....pitiful, not hilarious. Not even a snigger."
5,Clueless,"I don't have any comments. The game was for my grandson who wanted it, got it promptly and is enjoying it very much. As far as grading -- I'm clueless!"
5,Outstanding!,Based on the reviews of this book I decided to purchase it. No need to rehash what everyone else has written - everything written in the other reviews is completely accurate. The depth & scope of this book is something I've seldom seen in any tech book outside the safe & secure world of O'Reilly Publications - I'm completely stunned.
2,"Used to be good, but now is dated","This book is for more advanced users. For example, unlike most OS X books that would cover file transfer protocol (ftp), by telling you how to download and upload to other sites, this book tells you how to setup your own sites.It is a longer book and covers subjects in more detail than other OS X books I've read.I own this book, but it covers OS 10.1 which is too old. I recommend that you buy a newer version of this book that matches the version of OS X that you will be using.1st Ed 10.1, 2nd Ed. 10.2, 3rd Ed. 10.3, and 4th Ed. 10.4"
3,"yes, it was good but...","I never really connected with the characters. It seemed to me this was a hastily written book, and unlike other Morris books I've read, I found several obvious mistakes. Plus Morris repeated lines several times, as if each time he was writing it for the first time. I thought the ending was trite and quick, and what promised to be exciting, the whole revenge thing, was pretty much summed up in a few chapters. Sometimes books are subtly witnessing, but this one turned into a sermon! Not his best."
2,Quality,"Anita Baker: Rapture LiveI wanted to say first of all I'm old school, I can remember Anita 1st song and I followed her erver since, I have all of her cd's and when I saw amazon had her dvd I jumped on it, but what I dont understand, today its 2007 and DVD's has come along way and HD in whats happening. I ordered this dvd and had to wait over 2 1/2 months to recieve it and when I saw it at my home I was very unhappy with the picture quality, it was like watching a concert on tv 20 years ago. Sorry, but I feel it could have been more up to date.LMoneyCincinnati, Ohio"
2,Very Poor,I was very disappointed with this DVD. It has bad video and fuzzy pictures and is very out dated. I would advise no one to buy this DVD.
4,great for knife storage,"I ordered these because I have a few knives that did not come with sleeves so they get banged around in the drawer. I really only needed the larger sleeve (8"" chef knife) but could only buy these as a set. These work well but I wish the set had more of the larger sleeve (for the 8"" chef knife) and less of the smaller sleeves."
5,"One of those where you think, ""why didn't I think of that?""","These things are awesome. They protect you and your knives when you store them. The first 2 or so times you put the knives in the sheaths, the fit is gonna be a little tight, and you'll have to spend 10 or so seconds making sure the whole thing get's in there; but after that, the sheath will ""give"" and the knives will go in effortlessly. 5 stars."
5,covers the knives,"Not much else to say. Seem to be very good quality- keeps knives safe. Easy to place on the knives, easy to remove."
3,Ultimate Edge BS4 kife sleeve set,"These do the job they were designed to do, but be VERY careful when putting them on the knife. To install them correctly, you must hold them in one hand while pushing the knife blade down into it. One slip and your fingers are toast."
3,Cheap but only works while it stays on.,"This is a cheap replacement mirror solution until you can get a better OEM mirror. Provided an accurate field of view while installed. Placed it on my mother's '04 Camry on the passenger side and it stayed there for about 10 days till it fell off. Seems the double sided tape that was attached from factory is not very strong. Perhaps using stronger adhesive-tape or otherwise-might be a good fix. Still, I would prefer an OEM mirror.3 stars for possible improvement with different adhesive."
3,Is it for real ??,"I should be more careful and look more when I purchased my little Leica toy.... its a toy ... can be cute if you are 15 years old and go to a party with this camera, but its not real. It comes with a nice wood box.. but its not what I thought it was going to be. Again it was my fault I did not look in details before purchasing it. But its a toy.... at my age having a new toy can be fun !!!!!"
1,Really Disappointing Camera,"It looks/touches like a toy but not a LEICA titled camera, poor plastic cover, poor rubber USB cover.The small LCD display is deem and has very low resolution. You can hardly get any idea what is displaying on it.The picture image is really poor. I shot 3 pictures in my office(with a steady support)and found almost hardly see any details of the picture.The only attraction is the wood box I got.I am sure, I will refund it."
3,BitterSweet,"The camera was lovely, for all of 8 photos before the shot button became stuck :(The camera is a jewel, very sweet and beautiful - the pictures we did get to take turned out lovely. We were very sad to have to return it."
3,Does what it is supposed to do.,"I read one bad review and can only assume the buyer was expecting something much different that what was advertised. I have used this a couple of times to join narrow (1.5 inch by 2 inch) maple boards to make wide kitchen cutting boards and it does a good job. Even with some of the boards a little less than straight, I was able to get a good flat joint. I recently used it to join some ""off the shelf"" fir 1x12s to make the top and sides for a corner television table. After a minimum of sanding and a little spray paint, the joints were invisible.As for drilling the holes correctly, I had no problem at all.Having said all of this, I still would not give up my biscuit cutter/joiner."
4,Form over function,"OK, I have to admit that I was in *love* with my Cube when I first got it. It looked great, it was fast, I loved the fact that it was quiet, etc.BUT, I had a problem when upgrading from OS 10.0 to 10.1... it wouldn't go. It ran 9.2 and 10.0 fine, but not 10.1. I finally took it into the shop and discovered that it was a motherboard problem, and the shop guy said ""yeah, the cubes don't have a great track record."" Why? This guy's opinion was that Apple worked hard to cram that much power into a small box - with no fan - and they were pushing some limits in terms of component temps and lifetimes.Anyhoo, just remember to keep your Cube cool."
5,DAC at his best,"this is my favorite DAC album,though he has many,many to choose from.davids music is the purest form of country.add some blues and RnR and you have DAC.""tattoo/family album"" runs a close second.get these two then go from there."
3,What Can I Say . . .,"Of the two films on this DVD, I'd say the winner is ""The Wasp Woman."" Okay, so the film is low budget and the acting is questionable, but the face mask used to make the wasp woman was very creepy. Maybe I have a thing about bugs. There's something about those eyes and antennae which had me shiver just a bit.Too bad most people can't enjoy a good old-fashioned horror movie without CGI or modern special effects. The Wasp Woman represents those bygone days when you could see two for the price of one at the local drive-in. I can't say what a phenomenal movie it was but if you're into the old black and white classics, I'd say give this one a shot.As for the Gila Monster, don't even bother. This was really, really bad all the way. It's not even worth going into and wasting electronic ink to give a review. Take my word for it boys and girls: stay away!Thanks."
3,Good smoochin' movies!,"If you can't get too much of a mediocre thing, this Drive-In Double Feature is for you! Date up your honey and get set for some serious smoochin'...you won't miss much in this pair of less-than-classic horrors.Give your lips a break when the wasp woman and the gila monster make their brief appearances, and be sure to stuff a sock in the speaker when Don Sullivan starts crooning ""Laugh, Children, Laugh"" way too many times (twice feels like twenty) in The Giant Gila Monster!"
1,DVD Quality Poor,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The picture is blurry, sound skips, and the quality is very poor. I watch movies on my DVD player all the time, so it is not my player. Perhaps the VHS is better. Best of luck."
5,new to working out,"I've really liked this DVD. I've been working out every morning now for about 5 weeks. This has been a workout that has kept me going. It's fun, yet challenging, but it's explained well enough that it didn't go too fast for me. I used to be a runner in high school but it's been many years since I've worked out. I also have Total Mix, but I haven't been able to do it yet--I'm really out of shape! I think Total Mix will be more challenging but I'll be able to move to it soon. I also have another of Jennifer Kries' videos that targets abs, hips, etc. It's very similar to 3-Dimensional toning in the exercises she does, but it's more intense. Some of the reviews have noted the fuzziness of the picture and the ""80's music"", which is true, but it hasn't been a show-stopper for me."
1,If you have other JK videos...,Save your money. She is great but seems to recycle whatever she used before with a slight variation. Disappointed.
5,"Solid movement, the way your body is supposed to work.","I recently took up rock climbing and discovered that it was easy, thanks in large part to the training I get from this video. Although it is not for beginners or pilates purists, the movements are challenging and work your body the way it's supposed to move. The dance section is fun and challenging- I recommend 5 lb weights for more conditioned participants. The core section has made a tremendous difference in my body's actual shape, as well as improving my overall athleticism- I'm running faster and climbing quicker. Kries is cute without being phony, motivating without being kumbayah. Combine it with Perfect Mix and you'll be feeling and moving more gracefully."
3,Another Good one,"First of all...if you are looking to read this book I recommend you read ""Breakfast in Bed"" first. I did not know when I started this book that this was a spin off of B-n-B! I had already read it but if you had not then Send No Flowers could ruin the ending for Breakfast in Bed. Otherwise I enjoyed this book a lot!"
3,"Pleasing, but not her best.","I am a great admire of Mrs. Brown's work. I believe that I have read all of her books. This was a good book indeed, but others have been far better. Bittersweet Rain kept my interest far better than this one did."
1,Don't bother...,"Sorry Sandra, but I couldn't even finish reading this book. I just read Breath of Scandal and The Alibi back to back and couldn't put those books down. Got up early in the morning to read them and stayed up late trying to finish them. So, I was really excited when I saw another Sandra Brown book on my bookcase that I hadn't read yet. I liked the first paragraph. After that, it went downhill fast. It seemed like she pumped this book out way too fast. It was too simple. The dialogue, the characters, everything was a flop. I had myself believing that I could have done a better job writing this than her. To go from reading one like the Alibi to Send No Flowers, I just couldn't believe they were written by the same person. Sorry, I couldn't even finish it. I do enjoy most of her work though and will read many more of her books."
1,this thing is a rip off~,"We bought this and then realized that we didnt need it. But anyhow, after shipping the thing cost $20 for two little blocks of wood and a couple bolts. You can make one yourself for probably $5! What a rip off!"
4,A Handy Collection,"I'm pretty sure this is the only book occupying its niche--a good one-volume anthology of Hellenistic poetry in English. It includes the complete ""Argonautica."" The translations are clear and graceful. Two limitations should be noted:1. In lieu of any explanatory notes, there is only a glossary of proper names. This seems pretty adequate to the volume's purpose (introducing readers to this material for the first time), but this poetry does certainly lend itself to annotations that would facilitate greater appreciation.2. The only serious deficiency is in the selection from Callimachus. It is surprising to see a couple of famous and important (and, in my judgement, accessible) pieces--the prologue to Callimachus' ""Aetia"" and the ""Hymn to Zeus""--missing. These could have been included with just a few extra pages. Here, perhaps, the anthologist's tastes have interfered a bit with the goal of offering a first-class introduction to Hellenistic poetry."
5,Your Stories On Tape!,"A wonderful introduction to The Work of Byron Katie, The End of Suffering is a selection of powerful dialogues between Byron Katie and people-men and women, from child to adult-who have been holding onto painful concepts that no longer serve them. They represent us; they *are* us. As with all recordings of Katie facilitating The Work-her unique and deceptively simple self-inquiry process-there is food for thought here that you can digest again and again for new insights. From quotidien complaints to life traumas, The Work-a written process of cognitive restructuring, if you want to get fancy about it-is a way to relieve the suffering that occurs when we attach to thoughts that are not true for us. ""Confusion is the only suffering,"" Katie says. While you listen to these people ""undo"" themselves, you'll empathize, realize, learn, and laugh along with them."
1,"""Grandpa got run over by a beer truck"" = 4 stars.",... that's the ONLY reason to own this cd. The rest of it sucks so bad it's literally painful to hear. Produced by Wisconsin local DJ's or something? ... super lame.
3,LIBIDO/ POP PORN,"Es libido con pop porn, para comenzar no se que onda con el titulo del disco, la verdad, no sobrepasa mis expectativas, claro el disco no es malo, simplemente que esperaba mas de esta muy buena banda de peru, ya que su anterior disco me parece excelente de principio a fin(hembra). con pop porn, los temas que mas me gustaron son:fragil,invencible, una de mis favoritas y el vampiro, bueno el disco no es tan malo, pero creo que pudo ser mejor, si no chequen hembra primero antes de pop porn."
1,JUNK - Don't Buy It,"This software is an unmitigated disaster! It will transfer old programs, Windows settings, etc to your new computer (if you do not have any hidden unmovable files which the program will hang on), but the results on the new computer are terrible. Programs and setting on the new computer may or may not work. Some features work, others will not. The result is an unstable mess. You are better off relocating all of your programs manually. I understand that MicroSoft has purchased the company which produced this piece of junk. That makes perfect sense to me, since Windows sometimes works and sometime doesn't, but always will consumer a lot of your time to do the most simple things. :>"
1,Unreliable Relocator Ultra Uncontrollable,"I'm now on my 6th try to use AlohaBob PC Relocator.I have been online 10 years and am a web professional.This program does not follow instructions.I set up the transfer in expert mode and low and behold PC Relocator keeps transfer documents I specifically instructed it not to !On this last try, Im just 'letting' it transfer whatever 'it' decides to to my new pc.When it's done, I ll delete the files it erroneously transferred over and then I'm turning the disk into a flying projectile and brak it into million pieces against my wall out of sherr frustration.DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK !"
4,Quiet Storm,"The book was worn from use as described ; however, I was pleased with my purchase. I appreciated being able to locate the book and acquire it at such a good price."
4,Great shower head,This a great showerhead at a great price. We use it in our house in Mexico where the water system is gravity fed. It works perfectly there. This is our second purchase as the original head will need replacing in couple of years due to high mineral content in the water there. Very pleased with this inexpensive and functional unit.
5,Wonderful,"So we recently remodled and tiled our shower and replaced the hardware. I wasn't sure about this shower head ,especially after it arrived in the mail. I've got to say I love it. It is exactly what I was looking for to finish the job. I liked it so much that I've got one in each of my showers. I would buy these again in a heart beat."
4,Works for me,"You can't beat the price, if this is what you're looking for. The quality is adequate, etter than the price would imply.My son is 6'4"", so he needed something with an extension arm to make it high enough. I figured re-plumbing the arm wouldn't be much cheaper and definitely harder and riskier, too.He likes it, so I'm happy. He said he used to spend so much time in the shower because he would turn around and around trying to stay warm. He does spend less time in the shower, but I think it is due in part to the motion sensor/timer I put on the light. :) When the light goes out, he knows he's been in ten minutes, and he can wave his hand outside the shower for another ten minutes of light, but he needs to start thinking about getting out.One more thing: I figured if he didn't like the shower head, I could put his old head on the extension (I've done this with another brand), but that is not an option. As I said, though, it's not a problem either."
5,Excellent Showerhead!,"This is the second one of these I have owned.I bought the first one 13 years ago.The original wore out after years of use in 2 different apartments.this is an amazing shower head. great pressure , and the quality of the spray is superb as well.I am 6' 5"" tall.the arm enables me to position it way above my head. no more stooping under the shower for me.Purchase this and you will be a happy camper."
2,Disappointed,"No matter how many times and attempted to screw this shower head onto my existing shower stem, it would never line up in the proper position. This shower head system is missing an additional ""joint"" to allow for fine-tuning of the position of the shower head when it reaches the tightest point. Mine happened to reach the tightest point when the shower head was pointed sideways. Without the extra joint, there was no way for me to align it properly unless I loosened it a quarter turn, which would cause water to leak. I'm pretty sure I installed it properly, but not positive because there were absolutely no instructions included."
2,Not like the old model,"I bought this as a replacement for the same type I had. The head on the old one was corroded even after cleaning several times over the years with vinegar , etc. due to calcium deposits. The main problem with this one is they did away with the swivel nut on the arm where it attached to the shower arm coming from the wall. You need to turn this entire arm to connect it and hope it lines up correctly when it tightens up. It doesn't. Therefore it is loose and twists which renders it pretty much useless.Also the adjustment nuts on the arm iself are very hard to turn and don't keep position.Older model was way better and it appears they cut corners on this one and charged more $$."
5,The Best Showerhead,"This showerhead is just the best. It's a great price, and more importantly gives a great flow of water. We've had them in the last three places we've lived. I highly recommend this way over many very expensive showerheads."
4,Stuffed Animal Dog Musical,"This is an upgraded version of a classical toy. It softly plays a sweet song. It is not that educational, but it is super-cuddly. A perfect toy and companion for your little one."
3,"Good, but not that good.","I've used and fixed many Dewalt drills, and can sefely say that this one is ok, but has it's problems.The Planetary gearbox inside is know to fail, but is supposed to be getting better as it is upgraded.The switch had it's share of problems as well.The drill is very easy to take apart and fix.(Thankfully)The machine has poor balance and the front part is heavy,It takes little to tip it over.But there always a new one like this oneDewalt has built a new 14.4 2 gear machine(Based on the older 2 gear models which were very well liked)The balance is much better, as is the allround feel and handling."
4,Seems to do what I need,"Researched options before buying, and decided on this one because it had an all metal chuck, plenty of torque, and 3 speeds. So far it seem to be doing all that I expected. It has plenty of torque, it's taken a bit to learn to control it."
5,great drill!,"I've been using this dril for over a year now, mostly for driving screws, but I drill quite a few holes with it also. Mine came with two batteries and a charger. I won't go back to a single battery unit again! The torque is impressive. I sometimes forget to put change from drilling speed to driving speed and don't even know the difference (the battery runs down faster). The charge time for the batteries is a lot faster than my previous drills. I almost did not buy this because of the price. I would buy the drill again."
3,Just not a precision tool,"I compared this to a Milwaukee 0516-22 (which I own now) and when I placed a bit in the chuck, you can clearly see how it does not spin on axis. This is a problem for both accurate drilling for pilot holes or even as a screw gun as the bit won't sit in the screw head firmly. Sounds like a quality control issue. Milwaukee all the way."
3,"Had to send back, Wrong Cartridge",We had to send back to dealer we bought from since it was incorrectly ordered. Replaced with a correct 39A cartridge which was defective and had to send back?
5,Heavy duty chronograph,"If your looking for a watch that's not too dressy or sporty, than this Seiko chronograph is the watch for you. I bought this watch a year ago at Costco and can't think of anything ""bad"" to say about it. Out of all my watches, this Seiko is the one I wear the most. It fits perfectly on my wrist and even better than my other Seikos do. The quality of the fit and finish at this price-point is amazing and these pictures don't do it justice at all. I bought this chronograph because I liked the color of the dial and after trying it on, I could tell that it was heavy duty and able to withstand all the abuse that I would be giving it. Buy with confidence."
2,A Classic but an amateuristic publisher,"This book is an all time classic. Every serious bridge player should read Reese's book.However, it really surprised me that this new edition has a lot of faults in it. Not just silly typos (for example: printing East instead of West), but rewriting whole sentences that don't make any sense (like the bottom one at page 194).This is a shame. It seems the publisher was in too much a hurry to publish this book.The result: an amateuristic edition full of typos that don'tdo justice to this classic book."
3,"Great T-Shirt, Not so great fabric","I made a huge success with this t-shirt, funny as hell.The only complaint I have is the T-shirts fabric. It's kind of cheap and has a bad quality given its price."
3,TOSHIBA RD-XS52 DVD PLAYER,"I purchased this unit so that I could record TV shows without having to subscribe to TiVo service. The Toshiba recorded video well BUT was NOT CAMPATIBLE with my set-top box so that it could not change channels on the set-top box. My only(unacceptable) choice was to leave the set-top box tuned to a particular channel that I wanted to record. This makes multi-channel programmed recordings impossible.This unit plays DVDs reasonably, but, if you have a good quality monitor and you expect excellent DVD playback images, you may be disappointed. My Yamaha 2300just blows the Toshiba away.The saving grace for this Toshiba unit is that it offers good value for those with compatible equipment where ultimate image quality is not that important."
2,Not well thought-out,"There are essential, simple features missing in this DVR. For example, there's no mute button on the remote control! And even the volume button is difficult to use (you can't just hold it down, you have to keep pressing it). Also, editing and dubbing programs is much more complicated than it should be. I am sure there are better systems out there; this system is simply too complicated and just not well thought-out."
2,Such a good idea- very disappointed,I thought this was a great idea for my son(4) who is very mechanically inclined. I knew that he would need adult help so we worked on the Dizzy Fun Land gears together. We still have not got the whole thing assembled in fact we haven't played with it since Christmas. A couple of the main parts to the Ferris Wheel won't stay in place. They constantly pop off and ruin the work you just put into it! Overall I don't think this toy was worth the money.
5,Valdemar Companinon,"This book is a must have for any Valdemar fan! It answers all your questions about the Kingdom, gives brief descriptions about the books (to help with memory) and there's even a new novella from Mercedes Lackey herself!! Not to mention interviews and websites for fans to check out! If you have read every book on Valdemar or are just discovering it, this book is a must read!"
2,A little disappointing,"I love Valdemar. I love reading about Valdemar. Although this book does contain a new herald story, a few maps and a bard's description of Valdemar and its surroundings, it's not really a Valdemar book. It's also about the author and how she came to publish 26 Valdemar novels. All of these books are summarized. And there's a lot of dictionary, about half the book's worth, listing Valdemar terms, names and places.Frankly, I felt that there weren't enough interesting pages in the book to justify adding it to my collection. I left it in my hotel room."
3,companion,very useful when you come across a character in a book that you have not seen in other books also the short previews of all the books in the series most informative
4,At last!,"Okay so this was not absolutely perfect. Who cares? If you want perfect make your own. What this book does is give us (the fans) a place to look up any terms that might be unknown, maps the show the world of Velgarth, and a new short story of Ms. Lackeys. I think it is worth it. Thank you Misty. Without you this book would not have been possible."
4,This is a wonderful math book!,"I am a student attending USAO in Chickasha, Oklahoma. I am going to school to become an elementary teacher. I had an assignment that wanted me to find math books that were relevant to children. I stumbled upon this book. I found it to be extraordinary! It deals with so many aspects of math and money. I like the way this book deals with the complexity of borrowing and shows how to save and spend money. It makes so many connections to the real world. I must say that I was very very impressed with this book! I hope to use it one day when I am a classroom teacher! I recommend this book to all teachers, students, and parents."
4,Plain English,"I have been taught by the author of this book in London. I find her written words clear and highly accessible. As a text for classes, it has provided me with much needed insight into a new field about which I am now very enthusiastic. I acknowledge limitations in every methodology or 'ism' including feminism. I found this book, however, a clearly written and readable account suitable for a lay-reader and students alike."
2,"A sweet book, but it busted the myth...","Okay - I agree with the other reviewers - sweet, nice illustrations,humorous, and thought-provoking... so, beware. If your kid is starting to wonder about the whole tooth fairy thing, this book pretty much busts the myth. At least it did for my little one. In the book's favor, it is a gentle and sweet way to bust the myth (it beats hearing it from an obnoxious older school-mate like I did oh so long ago...). But, if you and your child are enjoying the tooth-fairy game, I'd wait on reading this."
5,Don't think - feel Rock Roll,"This is punk at its best. Not only do these guys have a great talent for song arrangement and timing, they have an absolutely hillarious sense of humor. Songs like S.T.E.A.K. and Ninja High School had me tapping my foot and bobbing my head while at the same time laughing at the bizarre lyrics that give Peelander-Z their uniqueness. After listening to this I'm curious to hear their other cds."
5,Candy Molds,This is an awesome candy mold. Great price and quick shipping. Highly recommend this seller.
4,Metabolic Booster = Perfection,"I wanted to give this 5 stars, but I don't ever use the core part of the workout, so I didn't think that was fair. The Metabolic Booster workout is amazing though. It's a great mix of stretching, light weights, and balance/posture moves that moves fast enough to keep me interested. I've done this one 3 times this week, and people keep commenting on my posture! I highly recommend this one, and anything with Jennifer Kries."
4,Great go-to dish for gf and gluten eating kids,"Buying bulk means I always have this on hand. Sautee onions and add ground beef and seasoning, cook noodles, mix. Have fed to at least 15 kids and everyone loves it! You cd add veggie or other ingredients, noodles and sauce alone too spicy for mine. Oh, only CON is the noodle packages aren't sealed and open on the bitten, take extreme care or noodles will end up all over floor in 2 seconds."
1,Never Again,Do not order from this COMPANY!!! I never received my book. I waited and checked the mail everyday in hopes that it would come. It never did. I contacted the seller and explained my frustration. I did not receive a reply. I am very disappointed. I hope people read this and choose not support this company.
3,America or London?,"I really enjoyed this book, but the one thing that drove me out of my mind was the currency in the book was dollars. In one particularly infuriating sentence, Jo's son, Thomas, says, ""Mummy, the machine swallowed my last quarter."" Now, the use of the word 'Mummy' tells me the book is set in England, the use of the word 'quarter' suggests to me that the local currency is US dollars. I found that 'mix' to be insulting, quite honestly. The change in currency is unnecessary."
4,A great read!,"You'll find yourself wanting to jump into the book just to smack people, but all in all, this is a great book. The characters are real enough to sympathize with, and just vulnerable enough to care about. The issue of dealing with four love interests isn't that complex, so don't worry about getting sidetracked. This is certainly worth an afternoon."
1,awful,"I can not believe all the positive reviews this cd has!!! It is terrible! Even if you can get past the fact that udo is not there, it just plain sucks. The singer is very poor with no range. The songs are very weak with no exciting choruses or melody. The lyrics are stupid, just don't buy it!"
4,vengeance,"4 any fan of japanese cinema of john woo and the like will love this film. its a typical revenge film, but well made with a twist. worth ur time."
4,Freakin good,An excellent collection and well worth investigating for anyone interested in music from the 1960s. You'll discover a whole new world and just dig those bass rhythms...!
2,"2,5 stars for a first black 007 Bond wanna-be Rapper","There is a rumour and large number of Interviews, he wants to realize his long dream to be the very first blackguy in the main role of James Bond 007. As a Rapper his talent is acceptable, although he does not actually always do a good Rap albums what every youngster believes nowadays.But as a smart british Agent 007 and his dream as the first blackguy in the James Bond-movies ?? I believe, the late author Ian Flemming will be rising up again from his grave and finds no peace."
1,"pee diddy and a ""chick""",what else is new? same ole stale beats...same ole stale pics...this guy is done musically...time to cut and run...
5,One of our favorite electronic pets!,"My daughter is 6 years old now. Last year, she got a Fur Real parrot from Santa. It was wonderful! But it could not understand many of her 5 year old commands. (in fact, my voice was the only one that it could understand 90% of the time) ... He broke and she requested another for Christmas. The store was out of Fur Real parrots, so I gave Lucky a try.Wow! I am very impressed ... He probably understands my commands near 75% of the time and my daughter's commands a little over 30% of the time. When he gets something wrong, I just say ""Silly puppy. I think he needs more training.""I gave him fun points because he is fun. Educational points because trying to make him understand encourages my daughter to speak up and speak clearly. And durrable points because ... well, lets face it. Life isn't easy with a 6 year old but he hast stood up to these last few weeks wonderfully."
3,PARTIALLY SATISFIED,"WHEN WE FIRST OPENED THE GIFT IT WORKED PERFECTLY~ BUT IN AN HOUR OR TWO IT STOPPED OBEYING ANY COMMANDS. Had to return it~if it worked it would have been really nice. My grandaughter was really disappointed,she wanted a dog, but she has allegeries,I thought this would be a good substitute."
4,Great Movie,Even though a low budget film this movie tells the story very well. The acting is well done and the extra's are worth watching. It is a great mob film even if your not from Cleveland.
5,"""A must see"".",This is a fantastic movie. I couldn't believe all the top rated actors that were in it. The fact it is based on a true story made this movie even better. This is hands down one of the most underrated organized crime movies ever.
4,What I expected,Good story line. I mainly bought this movie because it pertained to the Cleveland area during the 1970's. I was familiar with the incidents portrayed in the movie and wanted to see how they were depicted after the fact.
4,Interesting film,"This is a interesting movie. Although based on real events, it really plays like a crime drama. The movie manages to make a ""bad"" guy be fairly likeable and sympathetic. The other bad guys are truly bad. It was fun to see actual news footage worked into the story. Many would recognize ABC News investigative reporter Brian Ross in one of his earlier jobs. The movie does not necessarily glamorize the protagonist, but you do feel some empathy. All in all this was a good movie."
4,Kill the Irishman,"This movie was done in a very accurate manner, yet it doesn't come off as a documentary. I remember hearing about these happenings on the news back in the days when they were occuring. I found it very interesting. A brutal eye opening account of what was happening in organized crime before computers and internet."
2,Good Idea - Bad Product,"Great idea for convenience in loading/unloading a trunk without the big cumbersome hard shell. However, this product needs further development. Locks are terrible."
2,poor quality,"I ended up returning it back to the amazon stores. I did not like the quality. Its bonded leather (MADE in CHINA) after using it for a couple of times, one can notice how quickly it wears and tears. If one buys a belt, better make sure that its a bit expensive(so that the quality is good) or the best option to buy belts is to personally look and feel the product at stores."
1,Don't Order from this Seller!,I NEVER received this item! I tried repeatedly to email with NO response! Very disappointed!
3,"A bit too frozen, read Vollman's Ice Shirt instead","Usually I fly right through Jane Smiley's books, but this one lacks a vibrant touch. Maybe it is the dark frozen setting, maybe it is the characters who are all Lief the son of Eric, and Eric the son of Lief...but I found it leaden. I will say I admire what seems to be an accurate sense of time and place. The story is limited to what these characters would likely express and do and facing the frozen tundra they seemed to express very little. I admire this work, but I didn't get captivated by it. In contrast the same period and the same Norse sagas are fictionalized in Vollman's ""Ice Shirt"" a book that leaps and dances around on the ice. Read his instead and go re-read Moo (by Smiley) if you've ever spent time at a midwestern cow college. Go Badgers"
2,Depressing!,"If you want to read about hardship through an entire book, this is the book for you! Murder, starvation, burnings, more murder, more starvation ect. I got through it because interpersed with all this tragedy were a few bright moments. As one reviewer said the characters were ""cardboard"" but if dying was all I had to think about, maybe I would turn to cardboard. Depressing!"
1,Do not buy this toy!!!,"The Spectra Color Image pad is NOTHING like they make it look on TV! It is heavy and awkward for kids and it does not do what they claim it does. It is extremely difficult to make pictures with it. My son was so disapointed with this. He played with it 1 time and then asked me to get rid of it. He has never said that about ANYTHING, but I have to agree with him. This toy is a [bust]! PS. I would not have put any stars in the rating for this, but they would not accept 0."
1,Expensive Mistake,"My 5 yr old desperately wanted this toy for Christmas. His uncle bought it for him and paid a fortune for it. This toy has a ""pencil"" on it for drawing which is completely useless except for poking someone. It eats up batteries and the most exciting thing about this toy is pushing the on/off button. My 2 yr old is the only one that plays with this and that's all she is interested in. The stencil sheets are worthless because the colors are inconsistent, making the images hard to pick out. I feel bad that this was such an expensive gift. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it! (This is why I gave it such a high educational rating... I got the education!)"
1,Don't Waste Your Money...This is JUNK!!!,"Thank goodness for these reviews! I purchased this item for Christmas for my daughter and niece who are both 3 years old, I thought it would be a good alternative to Lite Bright...after reading the reviews here I felt I needed to take it out of the box and try it myself before giving it to them. I found the reviews here are right on the money (except for the one person who recommends this toy for some reason). There is no way to start out with a black screen to try and make a picture and you cannot separate the colors so easily, the tiny pegs in the holes just flop around on their own and do their own thing. This would have been a huge DISSAPOINTMENT at Christmas had I not immediately returned them. Thanks for the heads up everyone."
3,This toy doesn't work as it is intended.,"I thought I DID read good reviews for this item, but apparently I was mistaken, I wish I read all the others here first! Though this idea is a good one in theory, in practice the little permanently-affixed pegs, which are supposed to change color depending on the direction in which you lean them, don't stay in the direction you intend (especially when used by a child who has less dexterity and patience than a parent!). My 3 year old thinks it's fun, for a minute, just to push the pegs around and watch colors change, but will lose patience as he gets more discriminating - it's a joke that it comes with ""stencils"" to make pictures - I can see his confused face when he removes the stencil and the mush of colors under it resembles nothing. Find another artistic toy for your 2-4 year old."
1,A total disappointment and waste of money--FALSE ADVERTISING,"Unfortunately I purchased two Spectra Color toys...one for my daughter and one for her friend's birthday gift. If only we had opened my daughter's first we would have seen how totally awful this toy was and NOT given one to the poor birthday child! Although it is a wonderful ""concept"", this toy absolutely does NOT deliver what is promised...it is nothing at all like the commercials on television. It is difficult to move the pegs to the desired color, and once they are in place, they move out of position easily making it very frustrating for the child. It is almost impossible to see any image on the screen whether with the lights on or in total darkness. In short, what we thought/hoped would be a safe and portable alternative to the Lite Brite turned out to be nothing more than money thrown down the drain. Don't waste your money or risk disappointing your children...go for the good old Lite Brite or Lite Brite Cube instead!"
3,Great for children or adults with sensory issues.,"I was surprised to see how bad all of the reviews are. I didn't see the tv commercial though, so I had no expectations when I bought it. You can get different colors and you can make basic shapes, but it is very difficult to get any more intricate than that. What I LOVE about it is how great it is for children or adults with sensory issues. When you swipe your had across it to change the colors, you get both the visual stimulation as well as a texture sensation on your hand. I bought it for my kids, but I kept it for myself because I find it very relaxing to just make randome color patterns with my hands. Not sure how to word that better. Basically, If you are expecting to make images like a lite bright you will be disappointed. If you have a child with sensory issues and you treat it like a sensory toy, you will love it."
1,Trift store reject,"Got two of these at a thrift store for $2 each, and it was a waste of money. $60? Wow.As described in other reviews, the standard operation is useles. Lots of little toggles that are hard to get to a color and don't stay there.I got them to tear apart (maybe there are LEDs inside that I can use?) but it uses a dozen triangle-head screws, many down in long sockets. No wonder people think the Chinese are inscrutable - even I don't have a triangle-head driver, let alone a long-shank one to get those buggers out.Also - it uses 4 D-cell batteries, and since all the lights are on all the time (tho they aren't very bright - like whoever engineered this product), it should eat the batteries up, and even then they're protected by four (standard phillips) screws.I'm giving up and tossing it in the trash to save future researchers the frustration."
1,What a shame.,"My son wanted this toy so bad. It was all of the commercials and the catchy tune. My Mom bought it for him and I feel bad that she spend more than one dollar on this. The pegs, unless moved one at a time, do not work. You cannot just run your finger on it and expect to make anything but a mess of color. My 4 year old played with it for maybe 10 minutes and has not thought about it since. I believe my Mom paid $20 for it last Christmas. What a shame."
1,Piece of Junk,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! There is no way to create any sort of discernable design on it. Unfortunately my 5-yr-old likes the pretty colors and won't let me return it.
1,6 year old boy,Talk about a huge disappointment!! My son was so excited to get it from Santa that he had to put batteries in it immediately only to be disappointed that it did not work at all as shown on tv! It lasted all of 2 seconds and was put back in the box and returned to the store! My advice and my sons...don't buy it!
1,huge disappointment,"This has to be the worst toy I every purchased. If you are patient enough to get all the lights the color that the template shows in order to make a picture (not an easy task), please don't move the toy because all your efforts will be wiped out in a second. This was a complete waste of money."
1,A Very Disappointing Toy!!!!,"This was one of the few items my daughter asked Santa to bring to her. She was so disappointed in it! It is nearly impossible to make any of the designs as advertised on TV. And if you can come close to a design, you will have blisters to prove it!!! ... the item doesn't even deserve the one star rating!!!"
1,Piece of Junk,"This toy is junk. It does not work at all as advertised. The picture on the box and the images on TV, show a clear picture, showing that you can do so many ""neat"" things with it. You can't. My daughter has to lay on her belly with the lights out to make this somewhat work. She bought it with her birthday money (she's 4) and refuses to let me return it. I am saving the box and hoping she changes her mind. I even called the company to complain, they think it works great & say it is because of my daughter's age, not being old enough to work it properly. They could not think of a good response when I told them it doesn't work for her 31 year old mother either!!! Save your money."
1,not worth your money,The only good thing i see about this toy is using it in a dark room. It is difficult to get anything to show up. So after you tuck your kids in bed and you do not want them to go to sleep give them this. It might be cool to hang on a wall.Kristin
1,Couldn't wait to return this one!,"My daughter had to have this for Christmas after seeing the commercial.It doesn't do anything they claim.DON'T waste your money.My little girl couldn't wait to return this stupid thing to the store and get something else in its place.Also, had I had the option of 0 stars,that's exactly what this piece of junk would have gotten."
2,Very disappointed with this toy!!,My daughter got this toy for christmas and it was a waste of money. It didn't hold her interest for more than a minute... She usually likes this like this. She will be three in April and this toy was well above her age range. I can't even make the pictures!! And the light doesn't have auto shut off so I am sure this thing will eat the batteries!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$!!!!
3,For SMRA,I am interested in the Rio de Colores video you have.Please write me to marbaquero@yahoo.comthanks
5,National Ski Patrol Al Pine,"National Ski Patrol Rescue Hero ""Al Pine""As an active member of the National Ski Patrol System for the past 23 years I especially appreciate this toy and the fun and adventure that it brings my 3 and 5 year old grandsons. The fact that a portion of the proceeds from the purchase of this toy supports the National Ski Patrol is greatly appreciated also. Thank you Fisher Price for such a durable and educational toy that represents an organization that has served the skiing public since 1938."
4,"eccentric production, excellent preformance","The main reason to acquire this DVD is for the superb orchestral conducting and the excellent singing. James Levine, one of the finest Verdi conductors active today, paces the performance perfectly and illustrates many of the felicities of the composer's scoring of this attractive earlyish work.Maria Gughelina is in excellent voice as Lady Macbeth, though I sympathize with the fact that she has to sing some difficult passages lying down. She also is lumbered with some dreadful frocks. Macbeth is well sung although there is some strain in the high notes.The updated production is eccentric and tends to loose focus in the later acts. It does not however detract too much and the viewer gets a good idea of what Verdi is aiming at.The sound and picture quality are very good. Warmly recommended with minor reservations."
5,these are very delicate!,"these earrings are so delicate and gorgeous! i'm not too careful with most things, so i have all my earrings in two drawers in my jewelry cabinet. these earrings got flattened and a little misshaped after a few times of wearing them, but it's not that hard to get them back to where they're supposed to be. i've gotten a lot of compliments on these, even though i have several other pairs that look similar these stand out the most. i would hang them up on some sort of earring tree so they don't lose shape and definitely don't sleep with them on!!!!"
3,OK,"This book is alright, but it does not take into consideration all OS's on which the code might be running (xp users beware on the globalization chapter) and some of the end of chapter questions don't even seem to be based on data discussed in the chapter. That all being said, there aren't many other options exam prep books for 70-306 and this one is at least easy to follow along with although I don't think it is in depth enough for the exam."
2,There a much better books available,"It's obvious why this book was the first VB.NET book available. The book was obviously rushed, has many typos, pieces of code that doesn't work, and questions with wrong answers. The content of this title isn't anywhere near the quality of the study guide by Gunderloy. This book is a decent start for beginners, but if you really want to learn and pass the test, look elsewhere."
3,Not as Good as the First Series,"If this anime were to be a snack, it would be Cheetos. That is, it looks different, it seems fine when you try it, but you know deep inside that consuming too much of it will probably be bad for you. The premise of this series is absurd, which can be a good thing. In fact the first series is something I watch when I just want to put my brain to pasture. Unfortunately this disk, which is the first half of the second series is not as good as the first. They seem to have run out of stories to tell. The absurdity crossed into stupidity one time too many. Another problem was the absence of Jessica Calvello. Her manic performance of Celica was definitely missed. Since I am a fan of the first series, I will probably complete my collection with this series. If you are not a big fan of the first series, you should probably pass on this."
4,The Doctor is back!,"After not releasing any solo material for a ""generation"", the talented & creative Mr. Alan Peter Kooper reminds us just how good music can make us feel. As a baby boomer myself, I've followed Al's career and was thrilled to listen to his ""new"" material. Bravo!"
3,ok,"I was not crazy about this book. I enjoyed another book by this author much more, maybe called Keepers of the House."
4,"helpful for layouts, but could be better","My son is nearly 3 and just got into Thomas within the past six months, and in doing some research for Wooden Railway tracks I bought one of these.My son pushes trains along and at any switch, the trains may not move smoothly along one path or the other as others have commented. However this isn't a big deal to him as he's set on using his Wooden Railway and Take-Along trains on both tracks, anyway. (In case you're facing this situation and are curious, the wooden trains go acceptably on the smaller plastic take-along tracks, but the take-along trains don't move smoothly at all on the wooden railway.)I agree that two of them would help to build easier layouts, or you can use theThomas & Friends Wooden Railway - Cross & Switch Expansion Pack. This is not a cheap option either, but with multiple pieces it should give you more design options."
5,good unit,I've had it for over three years and I've had no problems. We've had many thunderstorms here and my components have been well protected.
3,"History & Myth, a Nordic Adventure of Changes","This was the first Vollmann novel I've ever read, but I may just try another one before all is said and done. The book starts out focusing on norse mythology and legend and leads up to the adventure of Leif Erikson's sisters to Vineland (later the Americas). Interspersed between the history/legend are snippits of a modern iceland/greenland that reflects much of the norms set forth in the more historical portions of the piece. A main theme in the novel seems to be change. This is largely reflected in what ""shirt"" (or serk) a character is wearing and the change in character based on goals. There is also a sort of sad lesson about the ""Skraelings"" (or perhaps Eskimos/natives/Indians) and their ultimate demise as a race but passing on of noble traits ""definitely not acquired from European teachers...."" A good read, but a little confusing at first."
3,Too Far-Fetched,"This book was a fun read. But, it is simply a cover for pushing ancient egyptian philosophy(occultic practices). It's simply a nice cover to get unsuspecting or naive readers to purchase more new-age reading material.The reading level is barely 8th grade. But, I believe that is the target audience 13-15 year old young men.What really made this unbelievable is how easily he captured some of the most hardened criminals by simply sneaking in to their homes in the middle of the night. One guy he 'apprehended' was millionare cocaine dealer with homes in ny and miami. i guy that heavily connected ain't gonna get caught by two poorly trained bounty hunters.His so-called seekers have no military background and p/u tracking by reading police manuals.....Get real.But, the book is a fun read."
3,Not Sure if I Believe It,"This book caused a real stir when it came out, and now it's forgotten. I'll vouch that Armstrong is better at his craft than Duane Chapman, but some of his stories seem stretched. The one about the fugitive who was in ""top physical condition"" seems to be missing some parts. Why would he go alone to do such a hazardous job? If the fugitive was as powerful as he claims, and backed by a family of huge porkchop-faced men, he'd be crazy to just ""arrest him at gunpoint"". Furthermore, a Black man from New Jersey would stick out like a sore thumb in a cracker community.There are some practical tips for bringing fugitives out of hiding. For instance, spreading the word that you have money for the guy will bring anyone out of hiding."
1,Ugh.,I was so excited to watch another BBC version of what is my favorite Austen novel but what a disapointment it was. The actors don't quite fit with the characters and it seems that all of the humor of the book is lost in this movie. The changes at the end and the running through the streets were just too much for me. Save your money on this one.
3,Not as great as Amanda Root's!,"This was the first version of Persuasion I had viewed. I liked it! Though it was a little boring and slow-moving.I was able to watch the older version with Amanda Root with my best friend (who has read the book). She said it was more accurate to the book and I found myself enjoying it far more than this version!I would recommend it, but not before recommending the Amanda Root one!"
2,Must Suspend Belief Here Because Of Character Casting!,"So far this is the only version of Persuasion that I have seen so far,and I thought it was ok,despite the fact that I usually avoid films and books that are full of 'angst' as almost this entire film is.I haven't yet read any of the novels by Jane Austen,so I cannot judge how true to the book it is.My real problem was that I didn't much care for the character of Anne Elliot(Sally Hawkins),I thought she was incredibly dull,and it was totally unbelievable that the 'Drop Dead GORGEOUS'(but his acting here doesn't thrill either)Frederick Wentworth(Rupert Perry-Jones) would have fallen for such a plain Jane,and pined for years for her!Now I want to see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.So I can't really recommend this version."
3,the 1995 version was better,"i loved the book. in the book Ann had such good judgment, understanding, and silent pride. in the 1995 version, or even the old 1970's? one, she had all these things. in this one she seems desperate, lonely, and weepy. she spends so much time crying and regretting things in the past that she can be embarrassing to watch. as for the male lead, he seemed to constantly be withholding things from her, his kindness, his regard, even the kiss at the end, and trying to punish her for the past that all i could say about him is [...]there are too many characters crammed into this version it can be confusing at times. also, it is on youtube if you want to see it before you buy it."
5,Great Purchase!!!,"I loved Rupert Penry in this version of Persuasion! I have the 1995 version with Ciarian Hinds as well but I really loved this version! Rupert brought an extra amount of angst and smoldering looks to Captain Wentworth and who doesn't love that! I thought Ann was plaid well also, except for the all the running close to the end but I loved the sweet ending with Wentworth, I wont spoil anymore than that! You will just have to see for yourself! HA! I thought Ann was seen as more emotional in this adaption than is some adaptions where she is seen as more of callus and a robot. She has some really emotional scenes in this movie where you really get to see her internal struggle! This was a great movie to add to my collection of everything period and Austen!"
4,Lovely adaptation,As an avid period drama viewer and having seen the 1995 version I am very happy with this adaptation. It was well done with the time restraints and very much possessed the romantic tension that Fredrick and Anne had. Very subtly done and developed nicely. The main characters are much lovelier than the 1995 version and Rupert Penry Jones is a dashing Fredrick. Overall I enjoyed this very much and is a treasure in my collection.
2,"Run, Anne, Run","Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's best books and this version really does not do the story justice. I don't think it was well cast (Wentworth was fine, but Anne was relatively annoying) and what is up with Anne running all over town, kissing all over Wentworth? I'm pretty sure all of that was not acceptable in the period, especially since Anne had given up her engagement to Wentworth because of her status, I can't see her flying in the face of tradition this much.If you really want to watch a version of Persuasion, watch the 1995 version. It was much more true to the story, better cast and better filmed."
2,Favorite Moments,A couple more hilarious moments that I don't notice other reviewers mentioning:-- Wentworth and Harville ignoring the drenching swells that are about the wash them off the Cobb.-- Charles Musgrove crossing the log bridge and strolling around the dining room leaving his shotgun unbroken and in firing position. I was a little disappointed that he didn't take out any of the characters that I could have done without seeing for the following sixty minutes.
2,A severe disappointment!,"I read the reviews but Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel - I bought the DVD. Apart from the miscasting of Elizabeth (she is beautiful in the book) and Mary (either she can't act or was mis directed)- I enjoyed most of this version but the ending.....the running was insanity! It ruined the whole production! I could not recommend this, the last BBC version was much better, buy it instead."
2,A capital disapointment,"Along with others who have written, I was very unhappy with this version of Persuasion. One would think that a newer adaptation would be better than the one in 1995 but this is not the case. The actor who played Captain Wentworth was well enough but where did they get the actress who played Anne Elliot? And why did the director spend so much time having Anne stare into the camera after writing one of her letters? How annoying! I did'nt really feel that much sympathy for her as much as I felt for Amanda Root in 1995. The gentle way Captain Wentworth helps Anne into the carriage in the 1995 version coming back from the 'long walk' was changed with the abrupt way this new Captain grabs Anne by the arm and hoists her on the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes! There were so many inconsistencies I cannot understand why this version was even made. Somtimes it is better to leave well enough alone."
2,Beautiful costumes and sets but...,"I agree with so many of the other reviewers, the Amanda Root version was sublime. I have seen it several times, including at the movie theatre, and that version was so rich and deep and satisfyingly romantic. In this current version though, I did like Sally Hawkins a lot. I found her to be a wonderful actress with beautiful eyes and expressions. It was not her fault her part was written so poorly and wimpily. Several reviewers have mentioned the kiss between the leads, I have to agree! It was not good, and shot at a bad camera angle.Also the sound was horrid, people were talking in those big drafty English parlors and rooms, and the echos were so strong it sounded as though they just had put little microphones on the floor.I did enjoy the show, but I have to say I kept constantly comparing to the 1995 SO much better version.And I hate that Masterpiece Theatre changed it's name to just Masterpiece. How stupid is that!"
4,Persuasion,"Typical of so many young women, her over attention to the opinions of others cripples her own happiness and it first appears that she is reconciled to her fate generated by her own choice. Happily Austin gives her a second chance to take care of her own needs. Would that others should be so fortunatel"
1,Please buy the 1995 version with Amanda Root....,Did the writer who wrote this 2007 version for BBC actually read the book?!
2,Missed to many important scenes,I read this book prior to watching any adaptations. This version gets it wrong in so many ways. Pivitol scenes are split up or omitted completely. Things made up. The ending - rubish. There is no way that Captain Wentworth could have given her what he did in the last scene. He did a great job at being steamy and intent... but the whole production was disappointing. If you want a better adaptation see the 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds. It is much more faithful to the book and does not miss or mess about with the pivitol scenes.
2,Not as good as the Ciaran Hinds 1995 version,"If you're looking for a well acted, true-to-story interpretation of Persuasion - this is not it. See the 1995 Ciaran Hinds version, instead.In this one - the haircuts are contemporary, the acting is moderately good but not memorable. Missing in this interpretation is the sense of stifling lack of privacy, the tension and the constant monitoring by family and others that keeps the pair from really communicating clearly.It's not as good a story as the book nor as good as the previous versions of the film. One of my favorite parts of the story is where Captain Wentworth writes out the letter while overhearing a conversation and unable to actually talk with Anne - and with a subtle motion, calls her attention to the note he has hidden - and her reaction. She did not go running all over town - that's just crazy. Oy. Get the 1995 version."
2,Not my favorite,Although Rupert Penry-Jones is quite handsome - more attractive than Ciaran Hines - I found Sally Hawkins poorly cast in this version. Amanda Root is a much better Anne. In this version Sally's 'acting' was basically sighing her way through the story. The film went quickly without jeopardizing Jane Austen's storyline. But Sally Hawkins ruined it for me - especially the longed awaited kiss that focused on her mucus laden teeth. Yuck!
1,A Travesty of Adaptation,"I was so disappointed in this version. The only person to whom I would recommend this movie is someone who has never actually read Persuasion or seen one of the purer movie adaptations. The movie is not without merit, but the scenes that are familiar seem to be recycle from earlier versions. Of that scenes that are not familiar, half are not even representative of the book. Apparently, the screen writers felt they were more capable of delivering Jane Austen's vision than she was. I could have forgiven the small disappointments throughout the movie if the end hadn't been varied beyond recognition. The fairy tale moment that we expect (Austen fans will know to what I refer) is so grotesquely distorted that it completely alters the character of Anne and makes her laughable instead of the heroine. The ending is absolutely slaughtered. If you love Persuasion DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!"
3,Odd Casting,"One wonders who was charged with casting the main characters of Jane Austen's charming story? Rupert Perry-Jones is excellent as the once-jilted suitor of the main character, Anne Elliot, but he is too handsome to be entirely credible as the jilted party, especially to the homely actress, Sally Hawkins, who plays Anne Elliot. Ms. Hawkins may be an accomplished actress, but casting her as the object of Rupert Perry-Jones affections is too far-fetched to take seriously."
2,A mess,"I have enjoyed many of the new BBC Jane Austen productions (Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility), so I had high hopes for Persuasion, my favorite Austen book. It started out well, and I rather liked the choice of a younger less weather beaten Captain Wentworth. Yet by the end I was shaking my head and couldn't wait for it to end. Sally Hawkins was a mopey Anne, who never did seem to get her bloom back. And the scriptwriter--what happened? Did he/she get drunk halfway through and decide to toss Austen's book? Key bits of dialogue were shifted around, and then ending with Anne running a marathon around Bath was a disaster. And the ending scene was a bit odd, too. It's not as if Anne was longing for a house for eight years...Luckily, we still have Amanda Root and the wonderful film from 1995."
4,Bules at it's best.,"From the first song to the last. Man!!! Blues at its best. I'd love to see this band live. But I'll settle for the next CD from them. They sound great, fresh. Turn it up."
5,Excellent,"This is one of the most diverse groups I have ever heard.Take a little jazz, add a little bit of blues, throw a hand full of alternative rock, and a pinch small pinch of country, mix it all up and what you've got is this work of art. And they are even better live."
5,Killer,"This band's for real. Music is killer. Just saw them at Bonnaroo and they were soooooooo good! Even better live, but get the cd. You won't be disappointed."
5,Tortured for His Faith,This has to be the best book I have ever read. It is very moving. It is hard to imagine how many things the author lived through for Christ. I recommend this book.
4,"A moving, yet horrifying account of one man's determination","I just read this book recently, and though it was written in the late sixties, its message is still stirring. Haralan, a pastor in Bulgaria, was taken from his home in the middle of the night and taken to jail. He recounts many of the horrors of the brainwashing process, sleep deprivation, starvation, and imprisonments during the Communist regime. He continued to find opportunities to talk to other prisoners about God's work of salvation. Haralan comes across as a humble man, serving God in each circumstance with grace for each day delivered by the God he served and worshipped. This account is very moving, and I would encourage you to read it for yourself. You will appreciate the freedom you take for granted. I was deeply moved and convicted."
5,good Value,great value recieved on time and used for all my greassy needs and I will use it more in the future
5,Great starter chopsticks for kids!,"I purchased these four our 16-month old twin boys and they work great to teach them how to use chopsticks. On first use, picking up miniture marshmellows, they both immediately got the hang of using chopsticks. Next day, using them with breakfast, one of the twins already uses them unassisted and the other needs only a little help getting them into position. They are a bit big for their hands but not too big. The twins do not hold them exactly right yet but they understand squeezing them to pick up things (but are still learning to unsqueeze in their mouth instead of in front of it).If you are going to teach kids to use chopsticks, these would be a great, and inexpensive first set."
5,I plowed through all three currently in print.,"What a bunch of page turners! Each was a good as the others. I thoroughly enjoyed all and I am looking forward eagerly to the fourth ""Dreaming the Serpent Spear"". Great books, I don't remember when I've been so absorbed. Frankly, I envy anyone who hasn't read them, they have tremendous treat waiting between the covers of those books."
4,Predictable but still very entertaining.,"This was the first Erica Spindler book that I have read. I do have to agree with a previous reviewer in that it was a ""cookie cutter"" formula and parts of the story were very predictable. I still found myself glued to the pages and unable to put the book down."
1,Soleusair MC-88 Party Fridge,"This Soleus party fridge lasted about one year or almost. It had been making loud funny noises, then it just stopped working.(tripped the breaker even) I can not find anyone who repairs them, and when I called the Soleus air Company, the person said if it's less than a year, with the original receipt, you can Ship it to them, at YOUR cost, and they will send you another one (also at your cost) (It's Cheaper in a lot of cases, to just buy a new one). They do not repair them.....Nobody does.... Nobody even knows how to even get it open to test parts.Soleus doesn't even Have parts to sell for it. Do Not Buy one.....Leave them in China...."
4,"""Love"" Gone Sour Again and Again",This book is excellent summer reading. Michael is a woman looking for love in all the wrong places. It never occurred to her until the very end that she had to begin with herself to find true love.
5,Excellent Read!!,"Crave delivers an honest look in the life of what many single women go through - the desire to be loved for who they are. This is not to say that every woman needs a man but all of us have a desire to be loved whether it's from family or a significant other. Michael doesn't always handle her crave for love in the best manner but I think if you take the time to read this book, you'll feel a pleasant resolve to her situation. Bottom line, buy the book and give it a chance. For some it may take a few chapters to get into but I'm sure that it will satisfy your crave for a good book."
4,used in middle school,I bought this for my 7th grade class. On game days the kids race to the table where this game is. I need to purchase more sets.
4,Fill in the gaps,"I'm enjoying this game. It's challenging and fun. Working against time and trying to figure out the best path for your cube can be difficult. Don't know if I will ever get through the whole game; still on the ""easy"" level. But, its great for filling in the gaps. Each puzzle is timed, I think most are about 2 minutes long so; I use the game when I have a short period of time to wait. It's a fun game I'll use for a long time."
5,It really Keeps you engaged,I bought this game for my nephew because he loves puzzles and math problems. It is an excellent game to exercise your brain. Every level gets a little more difficult than the previous one but you will certainly be pleased with it.
5,exelent,exelente calidad del producto. los use con una herramienta rotatoria. para grabar sobre vidrio y el resultado fue espectaculas. estoy muy contento con el producto 100% recomendable

3,okay,"this item did not fit my older style mailbox, so I had to rig it to fit, I like the style and the way this item works"
1,Avoid this CD,"Although this may be the worst LP album ever to make it to CD, it does not even qualify as good kitsch. Well maybe one tune, ""Goodbye Lucy,"" is worth a laugh and a groan for the lines,credited to Palance, ""Everyone said I was a groovy cat. Some of them said I was better than that. Everyone said I turned them on."""
4,Relating the GM Experience to Government Transformation,"Mr. Barabba has managed to capture the essence of what it means to become an enterprise that can adapt to current conditions and environments in a way that is compelling and entertaining. The perspectives he offers on how to achieve this sort of agility are key lessons that every industry and Federal Government executive should spend some time learning. The simple fact that General Motors, once the poster child for big, entrenched industry, is now in the transportation services business vice just selling vehicles should be a powerful eye-opener! If GM can do this, so can our federal bureaucracies. The practitioners of government transformation and those businesses that sell to government can benefit greatly from understanding the business designs Mr. Barabba presents in this book."
5,A labor of love from the Lobos,"This wonderful album sounds to me as though they made it just for the joy of it. I love the slight rock feel they have even as they precisely hit the rhythms of the traditional songs - a little of that laid back groove the Lobos always have. The versions of some great original tunes are also enjoyable, although Steve Berlin's sax sounds a little strident on ""Maricela"" here."
3,Okay Eye of Horus,The hook for the chain is too small...you can only wear this pendant with the less then perfect chain that comes with it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is a true Eye of Horus lover you are stuck with the tiny chain that comes with it. Would have been better with larger loop so one can interchange other chains....Just okay...
5,Nice & sturdy,"They're folders, they're nice, they're navy blue, reasonably priced. Completely satisfied. I use a lot of these, so it was nice to be able to order a whole bunch of them online and have them delivered. :)"
1,Not dark blue,"I bought these for work because I didn't have time to run to a local office supply store. These folders are lighter than medium blue, and not professional looking."
2,overheats to fast,heater doesnt heat room up that good at all and the unit itself get too hot too fast 1/2 hour and turns off
3,Three and a half stars,"I would have given this book three and a half stars if I could but since amazon doesn't allow a half stars I gave it three. Honestly, the book starts out interestingly enough but after the first couple of chapters the story just seemed to drone on for me. The majority of the characters in the book annoyed me to no end by the end of the book. I was just happy to see the book end.On a positive note the ending of the book was probably the best thing about it."
2,yuk has gotten soft.....flip it to the east coast style,"just another westcoast rapper who has chosen to bite off of jada kisses' style......it makes me sick. there are a couple of cool songs (pimp that b@#$# is the best), but nothin that is hype like he used to do. there are way to many wack rappers on the album also, who also rap with the jada kiss east coast flow but are steady claiming the west...its sad. yuk still is tryin to use that oakland vocab but he aint keepin real by no means, his style has gotten soft as hell. if u love the bay area hype type sound dont buy this album. yuk let me down, he is soundin like a straight sucka."
4,Just what I needed,This is the right little adapter to rescue your old existing power supply for use with the next generation of Nokia phones designed to be charged with the light weight power supplies with the new tinier jack.
3,It was ok,This book was an easy read and wasnt all that scary to me but it had a good plot and stuff.So if u have nothing to read waiting for another book this would be a good book for that
3,Well illustrated,"Trees for the Yard and GardenJohn Cushnie2003 Trafalgar Square 224 pages ISBN 1-57076-236-8This is quite a pleasant, well-illustrated book about trees you might think of growing in your garden. As usual with this type of book, about half of it is just a directory of trees, giving info about zones, height, spread and the trees likes and dislikes.The first part of the book discusses trees that will do well in certain circumstances or for certain purposes - clay soil or winter display, for example. The book also explains planting, propagation, transplanting and gives ideas for hedges and avenues.You won't find much that is new or inspiring here but Sarah Cuttle's photography adds visual appeal to to a somewhat pedestrian text."
1,Clamp pads leave oily spots!,These pads do not leave a mar but leave a oily spot that is hard to sand out. So much oil that the oil spots keep returning!
3,Clamp Pads,"I needed some clamp pads for my Pony F clamps. In the past, I would go to the tool shows and pick-up some China made pads (red colored) that were made of a harder plastic than the Jorgensen pads that were softer and didn't fall off the clamps. I ordered the Jorgensens and to my surprise they were made of the hard plastic in China. The same color and shape as the original Jorgensen pads, but the new hard plastic that falls off when you least expect it. In addition the new pads leave an ""oil spot"" on the wood. I'm going to rinse the pads in some mild solvent and use contact cement (if it will stick to the oily plastic) to hold the pads on. Hope this will help, and if I need any more pads, I'll buy the cheaper China pads at tool shows."
4,An excellent collection,"Per the title, yet another fine collection, selected by the fine, creative and insightful mind of Garrison Keillor. I do not think it works at all well with a Kindle. Were I given the chance to re-purchase it, I would go for a hard copy. Poetry books on the Kindle have proven to be a bit of a challenge to read, for me at least."
5,A better bargain would be hard to find,"Five poems that move you, between two covers, would be worth many times the price of this book. You'll find many more than five in this elegant collection."
5,Great BIG Help,"I recently started school as an apparel design student. Most of the teaching is for the industry rather than home sewing. Yet, this book has so much information that applies to the professional techniques we are being taught.It is helpful to student and home sewer, novice to old pro. I also bought the photo version by Singer and didn't find it nearly as informative. Buy this book and you will use it."
3,A bit slight,This Guide is slighter than you'd expect with regard to the kind of detail that Genesis fans would really love. Good but not great.
5,Love the flavor,They are really yummy gummys. The texture is soft. Seem like they are marshmallow not plain gummy. Will reorder again when I run out
5,More than Just Ani Difranco,"It's easy to say that Alix is just copying Ani Difranco, especially if you're a huge Difranco fan. But, let's be honest, folks, I really think that Alix is unique and very, very clever. Her poetry is more than just words, it's what all writers grasp for... a voice. She can make us all look back and wonder what life is really like. She has a tour coming up and I highly recommend you check out her web page for details. I won't miss it for the world."
4,Date Night Movie,If you love quirky movies about twenty-somethings becoming adults then you'll love this movie:Quirky screenplay - checkNew York - checkUp and coming actors - checkGood soundtrack - checkGrab the wine and the popcorn and enjoy the movie
5,This Movie is Great!,"Love this movie - the cast is incredible - They all play their roles as if they are playing themselves. The stories are ""real life"" situations. You can so relate to. The streets of NYC are depicted in real time - you can feel the heat of a NY summer. this movie as been lifted into my top 5 movies of all time.Teri Z"
5,Even my kid likes this!,"This is an amazing collection of songs, all performed with such skill that even my 8-year-old son likes this CD. Brahms and Beatles, Mozart and Ellington, there is something here for everyone. And thank you, thank you, thank you for ""Bassoonist's Holiday."""
2,Funny parts stupid movie,"The movie plot is probably the stupidest I have ever seen. There are some pretty funny parts like at the garage sale, but other than that it's pretty stupid."
2,"Not bad, but needed to follow through","Not a bad movie. Will Farell has shown he can act (Stranger Than Fiction - go watch it), and he does a good job here. The kid (sorry, missed his name) did a wonderful job. Acting was really good all around. What was lacking was the script. Or rather, the ending. Given the final bits of the movie (Nick giving away the last of his stuff), the implication to me is that he was going to kill himself... and we get no indication of that. There's no indication of *anything*. He gives away his stuff, he hugs his neighbor, fade to black... um. I didn't expect an actual resolution, but some indication of what happens next would have been a really good idea."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Awful. Simply awful. I watched thirty minutes of this slow, unfunny, pathetic excuse for a movie. I think my exact words were ""if I have to watch one more minute I will shoot myself in the head"". Worst. Movie. Ever. 'Nuff said."
4,Great Gift for 2nd Birthday,"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday and loves it. The sound is SO CLEAR. We have other toys that say the ABC's and many sound distorted. Not this toy. It is great. When she isn't playing the individual letter songs she is dancing to 4 other children's songs. She is still a little to young to play the find the letter game... but that is ok because this toy will grow with her!! Also, it's the perfect size for little hands to carry."
2,Not a good toy for phonics,"My son got this toy for Christmas just before he turned 2. He loves listening to the few songs that are at the end, but otherwise, the toy is useless. It is very hard for me to understand the differences between some of the letters- I have to hear what word it's using as an example. It's a fun toy to tote around and listen to the songs, but as a learning device, it just isn't as good as other leap frog products."
4,Fun Alphabet for Years,"Bough for boy/girl at 2nd birthday. Both have played it since, and are now 4.5 years old. They know their alphabet and are using the toy to learn the phonics of the letters. There are cute little songs for each letter of the alphabet, which reinforces the lessons in a fun way. Used in car and on trips. Great for shopping time distraction. Took a beating from my two, who ""drop and go"" when they're done with a toy. Pretty good on batteries. Only replaced them 3 times in 2 years! Colorful, simple to use, low and high volume settings."
3,"Annoying for adults,fun for kids","My 16 month old son really loved it when we first got it. He can turn it on and off by himself, but it usually gets turned on the loud volume setting and IT IS SO LOUD! My husband and I have found ourselves dreading him turning it on b/c the voices (especially the woman voice) and songs are so annoying. And the toy keeps talking long after my son has put it down, which is also annoying. That aside, he really does enjoy finding the letters and flipping the pages. For the price it is a good ABC/song toy if you have nerves of steel."
5,Love this!!,my daughter rec'd this as a present when she turned one. She is now 14 mnths and is still enthraalled with it. it is a very sturdy toy and has great educational value. I would definitely recommend this toy.
4,The best author of this genre,"While this is one of her older books, the storyline is about a physical therapist who fights for the rights of a comatose child who, she believes, is curable. The descriptions of the Monterey Peninsula, Carmel and Big Sur do not change with time and the result is a good read, especially for fans of Ms. Whitney."
2,This book is as fiction as they come,"Susan Atkins is a liar and this book proves it. She wrote this book approaching her first parole hearing in 1977, how convienient. Apparently it did no good and now this book is long forgotten and out of print...as it should be."
4,Hot Shot,"I think Hot Shot is very cool but needs 2 paticular tweeks.#1: thelegs can snap of if you apply enough force(But then,that's normalfor ball-jointed transformers and they go right back on.)#2 Thethe wings work great at first but then THEY JUST WON'T RIGHT AAIIEEEE!!!! But besides that it's a great figure."
3,"Good Taste, Took Expensive On-Line",I just found this at a local Walgreens for $1.98. Paid nearly $6 for one which is 3x the price.
4,Haribo GoldBears,Pretty much the same as the american version except for a couple additional flavors added to the mix.Not worth the additional expense in my opinion.
4,Everybody has to eat..,"Although everyone has to eat, we do not have to develop or engage in food addictions. Kay Sheppard's book, Food Addiction addresses a problem many people have yet few want to acknowledge. Her book is a helpful guide to understand what food addiction is and ways to overcome those addictions. It contains self-test and practical information on the taking the steps to overcome this addiction. With all the sugars and other additive presently in the American diet it is not surprising that such addictions develop. Rather than suffer in silent desperation, taking the action steps in Food Addiction will help you overcome this behavior that influences your health, thinking and emotional well-being. Since the cost of the book is lower than a good meal, it is a bargain in terms of what it can do for you.Jeffrey Murrah[...][...]"
4,Not 60 gallons - closer to 30,"For this order your receive two standard bags of peanuts for a total of around 30 gallons of peanuts, not 60. At that amount, these peanuts are comparible in price to many other peanut sellers here on Amazon and this is not as good a deal as it first appears to be. To be fair, when I pointed out to the seller that it was only 30 gallons, he did send two more bags of peanuts making it 60 gallons total. So, if you get four bags of peanuts at this price, it is indeed a good deal."
4,Welcome back Teena!,"I am so happy to see Teena Marie back on the scene with her new CD. I am so glad that I bought this CD! I love almost every single on this CD, especially ""A Rose By Any Other Name"" with Gerald Levert and ""Recycle Hate to Love"". I have always been a Teena Marie fan, and with this CD, I will continue to be a fan."
5,Nice,"I think Tina still has what it takes. She has been quiet for some time but she knows how to re-enter the scene, unlike other artists. Her music is fresh and different, and although she has a distinctive sound, her songs are different from her old music. Her voice is awesome. You go girl!!!"
2,Just to big to move quickly,Used for a couple of days then went back to a smaller more responsive mouse. Hard to pick up and move quickly - so no so good for online games
1,YECH!!!,"First off, it's not the music making or singing that make this such a horrible evening at the opera. It's this psycho, pseudo-Eurotrash production that puts the beloved classic in some weird time and place - we have fish-headed waiters instead of a dream pantomime, a hausenfrau witch and a lot of other weird stuff. True, it's not as godawful as the ENO production of a few years back (that takes place in WWI England, the sandman is a coke-snorting wastrel and the mother and witch are portrayed by the same singer) but I wonder how awful opera productions have to get before we all scream, Enough!If you get this one, turn off the picture and just listen to the music. Or better yet, get the earlier Met O'Hearn Production which has thankfully been reissued by DGG."
4,Great episode!,"""Fetch with Ruff Ruffman"" has been off the air for a few years here, but I still remember how much my kids enjoyed it and I particularly remembered this premiere episode, in which Ruff sends the kids across Boston to illustrate the relative distances between the planets and the sun.My third-grader is studying the planets this year, and did not remember this episode. I bought it so that she could view it. It's every bit as good as I remembered."
4,"good, not ideal","the two books by hirsch smale, one with devaney, seem like good books, but I am not crazy about either, at least from the few pages one can search online here.the latter book with devaney just seems a dumbed down version of the earlier book by the two more famous authors. i expected that earlier book to be far better, but found to my regret that the two books actually share almost the same first page, and the main difference noticeable in the early going is that the 2 author work is poorly written, and the 3 author one is not written much better.it is clearer but seems to be talking down to the reader in an annoying way. so neither is the absolute pleasure to read that the wonderfully written text of arnol'd is, or the classic of hurewicz. i would skip these books and get arnold and hurewicz instead."
3,terminals suck,it sounds good but the positive terminal lead was shot so i had to rig a new lead up but it works like a champ now
3,Pyramid WX65X 6.5-Inch High Power White Injected P.P. Cone Woofer,The Pyramid WX65X 6.5-Inch High Power White Injected P.P. Cone Woofer is a great deal for the money spent. I had JL in there before. Sometimes life's a compromise...
1,This is not Elastikon,"This is NOT Elastikon from Johnson & Johnson. The weave is different and the core is plastic instead of paper with the trademarked name on it. I will be returning this product and if necessary, disputing the charge on my credit card."
4,Great Heater,"Heater was easy to set up although the handle took me more time than I want to admit. Filling the tank is easy even though you don't know when to stop (I overflowed the tank and had to wipe up excess). My heater would not start from the automatic lighter. I suspect it was because of the first time operation and did not have the kerosene ""wicked"" up high enough to catch. It is easy to start with a BBQ lighter though and burned well over 8 hours on my first tank. Heat zone is pretty localized but I expected that. Overall, it is exactly what you see in the ad."
4,Auxillary Heat,"This is a well made heater. I have used K1 heaters in the past and this is the best yet. It is heavy, though. The lifting handles feel flimsy, although they seem to do the trick. Operation is easy, but the assembly guide and some of the instructions were less than clear. Assembly is still pretty easy. If postioned near a fire detector, it will cause an alarm. Filling the built-in kerosene tank can be a little messy, but a siphon is provided and that makes it pretty easy. It will smell of kerosene on ignition and when shut down. If you need some good auxillary heat...this one is probably the best you can buy."
4,Nice and warm,"This kerosene heater did everything it was advertised to do. Assembly was fast and easy, and it puts out a great deal of heat without much in the way of kerosene fumes."
3,"Sengoku CV-2230 KeroHeat Convection 23,000-BTU",This heater is okay. The problem is me. I can't handle the kerosene as it gets in my lungs and makes me cough. It produces a lot of heat which I appreciate on a chilly day or night. My husband turns it on outside as per the instructions then brings it in the house. I might have to buy an electric heater :(
2,Defect with auto shut-off mechanism.,"I've had this heater for a few months. It would be great if it didn't keep shutting off when I try to turn it on. I think there's a design flaw with the manual shutoff button and dial. It's incredibly finicky, I'll turn it on and try to adjust the flame and then the knob automatically rotates back to the left and shuts off, emitting kerosene fumes in the process. When I do manage to get it to remain on, it might turn off at a slight nearby movement. At first I thought it was a manufacturing defect with my unit, but I've seen other reviewers with the same problem. Any known solutions? There seems to be no simple way of disabling this faulty auto shut-off mechanism."
5,Great stuff:,"Tired of microwave popcorn that is all greasy and chewey? Jiffy Pop makes it easier to make stovetop popcorn. No pans to clean, no need to keep oil around. All you need is a stove! People are always talking about how hard this stuff is to cook, but if you are able to carefully follow the instructions, you will get it perfect. Remember, it's the same prinicpal as cooking a steak. If you have the heat too high, you sear it and the inside is raw. What you have to do is keep the heat on medium, and keep shaking to move the unpopped kernals to the bottom. When the popping slows, pull it off and enjoy!"
5,Old time popcorn,This was used with the long handled holder at a campfire in our backyard. Yummy stuff when it doesn't get burned from too long in the fire :-) Thank goodness we have so many and enough fires to perfect our technique.
1,An unbelievable waste,"I can enjoy good horror, schlock horror and even horror so bad it's good horror if only for the film merit but ""Attack of the virgin mummies"" has none of these. It is nothing but a skin flick and a bad skin flick at that.The idea is that millennia ago...oh heck it doesn't matter. These horror/skin flicks can be good if they try but this doesn't even try. It's a bad excuse to have the most Nordic looking ""Egyptians"" EVER standing around naked with virtually no sets-posing as they call out to one another just so you can change shots to the next girl calling back. Shot on video tape instead of film it has a tacky, 1980's feel in all the wrong ways for its look. It doesn't even work as a skin flick.I hoped it would get better but it didn't and I will confess I couldn't even make it to the conclusion. I saw no point and will never, EVER in my life wonder what happened at the end. The cast and directors clearly didn't care why should I?"
5,Southern Winds,"This is a book I highly recommend for those who are interested in United States history, specifically Georgia history. It is the true account of a southern gentleman confronted with the social changes brought about by integration in the south. The author is a registered pharmacist who owns his own drug store in Griffin, Georgia. Since segregation was always a part of his life while growing up in Valdosta, Georgia, the uprisings and often violent attacks on his drug store came as a surprise to him. Definitely worth reading."
5,Perfect,Bought for my granddaughter ages 3 and 5. They use while in their car seats in the van. Sturdy and has pockets on side for storage. Helps them pass time when coming to Nana's
3,Alex Desk to Go,"Kids love the pockets to keep their pens in. Desk top could be a little sturdier, can see it giving in before long. Kids enjoy using it in the car to draw on though and again, the pockets are great to keep their stuff from getting lost."
1,Cardboard,"I purchased this for a gift for Christmas. When it arrived, it was only a piece of cardboard. I was unable to give it as a gift and had to purchase a different one. It is not durable and would not hold up to the everyday use of a child."
3,"Great idea, just not well made",I purchased this for my grandson to use in the car as we were taking him on vacation. He really enjoyed using it but in a few days the strap pulled out from the pillow part of the desk.
1,Killer tempi and underemotional organist spell death,"This CD should be ideal: a Bavarian ensemble, beuatifully rich organ, and a native composer to popularize. But it's awful. The tempi are far too slow and laboured. The whole effect is as if the orchestra and organ are desperately trying to find some middle ground. They never do. Fast passages on the organ are missing or ""thrown away."" I tried to take this CD back to the store I bought it from, but they wouldn't accept returns. Why the E Power Biggs recording on Columbia is no longer available is a puzzlement; this was one of his best. Copyrights, perhaps?"
4,Obviously Mount Rainier,Al Gore might have grown up there had his father been a plumber who moved north for work. Not many St.Albans boys in that neighborhood though. As in none. Gotta wonder if Harrington and Gore don't hook up once in a while what with the wellheeled intellectual Nashville/DC connection. All in all not a bad intro to a forgotten people in a very interesting time and place. I was happy to have stumbled upon it.
4,Nice Touch,I am from Springfield and found the book to be very interesting. Wondering who all this love was given to. I enjoyed your book. Look forward to your next one. Keep moving don't stop here.
5,Works great,"Great product, very sturdy, well built. Had to adjust the tension after install. Just follow directions for that. Overall, I am happy with it."
5,singing the stories history hides,"Jenny Factor's often deceptively casual poems wear their prosodic mastery lightly, combining formal fluency and personal urgency, fulfilling a will to make form out of feeling: ""This life I've written out and can control."" Unraveling at the Name revolves, unravels even, around a remarkable set of skewed sonnet sequences about love requited and un- (and love's various alibis and substitutes), desire and sex and their often awkward relationship (what Factor calls the ""urgency of appetite""), marriage, coming out and learning to come, lesbian motherhood, and loneliness. A canzone about fisting informs us that ""Forms/binds. Form combines. Form liberates,"" and this book demonstrates the ways in which all of these propositions can be true, simultaneously and in turn. ""My story's underneath this history./Turn off the radio. I want to sing,"" Factor writes, and sing she does."
2,"Lots of Features, Little Wow","I'm going to keep this as brief as I can. I am now on my 4th, yes FOURTH Dash from T-Mobile. While the phone carries a lot of very useful features and seemingly easy to use interfaces it is incredible poor on performance.So far I have experiences freeing, random reseting, lock outs, full failure, inability to dial out and other random problems. I can't tell you if it's the phone or Windows Mobile 6, but regardless of which it is it makes the use of the phone frustrating and almost downright worthless.Because of all the problems I'm switching over to the Blackberry Curve. Maybe I will have better luck as my friend is having better luck with his Blackberry Pearl (after having 4 Dash's himself). Even a T-Mobile store rep has told us of the numerous problems people have had with the Dash and it's sister phone the Wing."
4,Good Phone CRACK SCREEN!,"Okay get this, left my phone on my desk in my room and left for an hour, i had locked the door so nobody could have touched it, came home and screen was cracked for no reason. Went to T-Mobile Store and it was my fault annd would cost me $110! Stay away"
1,Great device - fragile screen. Poor warranty,"Great device while it's working. I loved using it and recommended it to many friends. However, after 6 months my screen cracked while the phone was in my pocket and I was watching TV. No rough treatment and not dropped. The warranty doesn't cover cracked screens regardless of reason. A phone that you can't put in your pocket without risking a cracking the screen and having to pay $200 for repair is very poor in my opinion. Search for ""T-Mobile Dash Cracked Screen"" before you make your decision."
2,Great phone but far too fragile for everyday use,"I have had this T-Mobile Dash for about a year now and I am on my second one. I cracked the screen on the first one by putting it in my pocket without the case. I had to pay the whopping $110 that the insurance company uses as a deductible. What a rip off. That is probably what they pay for the phone wholesale. I then had the next phone for about four months before the same thing happened. I am not sure how it cracked this time, but it did. In my opinion, they shouldn't create a phone that cant handle a bit of pressure on its screen before cracking. I am very seriously thinking about dumping this phone because I can't afford to spend $110 every few months or so to have this phone. Don't get me wrong, the smart phone functions are great, the battery life is fine, but too fragile."
2,T-mobile dash,"I have been using this phone but not happy with the battery life, it dies fast if you use Wi-Fi. Would recommend Blackberry curve instead."
2,"Probably too late to help anyone, but...","It's late 2010, and I've had this phone for about twenty months. It does not hold up well.-Bootup takes longer than windows 95-Mobile Internet Explorer is horrible, hangs, doesn't render right, no zooming-Goes into spazouts where all the key presses are delayed several seconds-Battery life is less than a day if you plan on actually using it-Battery cover pops off all the time-Had to take perfectly good micro-sd card out because of some glitch that causes infinite rebootsThe only things that have made this phone bearable were Opera Mini (which made using the horrible EDGE network almost tolerable) and Google's downloadable map program.I'm considering paying the early termination fees to get out of my contract just to get rid of this phone and the horrible data network I'm stuck on."
4,Strong,I think Matze came out of the gate without having to prove anything to anyone. Having written for other acts for years his talent is evident from the start. And Reim 2 is more of what you loved in Reim 1
4,"beautiful, but missing accessories","I bought this doll because I received Cali Girl, Summer's Horse as a birthday present. They did not have the Summer doll with a cowgirl hat and the Lea doll only wore sandals. The hair is awesome, real ashy blond with realistic highlights, and she smells of sun tan oil! But - NO ACCESSORIES! Where's the bucket? The brushes? The beach towel and canvas bag? I see pictures now of dolls with these accessories and I know in my area, they are kind of ""sold-out"". Were there 2 editions? The doll rides very well. She is easy to pose and her cowgirl boots are awesome - cream color and tipped in brown, the cowgirl hat is super feminine sunshade. I have vintage Dallas from 1979 and she looks very beautiful on him. I don't think the dolls necessarily need to coordinate to their specific horses. The clothes are lovely, but I sure wish she would have had a brush, even for her hair! (She had the stand included, though and a calendar). This was my first Cali girl."
1,don't buy!,"bought the watch for my husband for his first fathers day. The watch came without a box, warrenty or instructions and was broken. Company refuned money....was literally a waste of time!"
4,Helpful....,"After taking the NET I found this book helped me with the math portion but not with the reading portion. The reading portion of the actual exam was much harder than in the book. If you need to brush up on your math skills, this book is excellent for that. But make sure you prepare for the reading on your own. (Inferences, predicting outcomes, etc.) The guide book is very expensive for the size, but if it helps you it's worth the money."
3,good transaction,This book was not quite what I thought it would be. Probably could have done without it.
1,"Hard to handle, delivered with a deep cut into the book starting at cover, better for the UK - ingredients na. in US","This book is really not for use in the US, many foods not available in the US or suited to tastes of Americans.Product ad. did not say it was for a stove top steamer, needs conversion to the electric stamers most often used in the US. Since the book arrived damaged it is hard to open and generally stiff. I am not pleased with my purchase.Celia Snyder, USA"
3,Easy reading,"Not a bad book overall, I enjoyed reading it. The short stories do have a common thread running thru them, so they run together somewhat, Its the kind of book that you can just lay in bed and read as much or little as you like. Interesting take on the undead in a strange world hopefully very far away."
3,Good for old age or sick people,The exercises are too easy and boring. There is no challange at all. I thing that older people or very beginers might find it helpful.
4,morning night and inbetween,"Gave this dvd 4 instead of 5 stars only because ironically I like it so much and yet feel it could be even better, or maybe I just want more from this very helpful talented lady. If you do both the am and pm segments you'll begin to see some overlap and where they cross each other into night or day time. Both my wife and I appreciate Ms Lewis' stretching tips, cautionary notes, and balance of stretches. I guess what I'd like to see from her, is a dvd with more extended stretches, and another with more stretches like her bonus stretch on this dvd, which is closer to being an exercise/stretch blend, which is kinda nice. Highly recommend."
3,Item in good state.,"The item (book: Psychology of Judgment and decision making) arrived in a good state. I rate the good as ""it's ok"""
3,Exit: This disc. Enter: Ce Ce Peniston ESSENTIAL CD,"Yeah, you have 11 hits here but the highlight of this disc is the 12"" version of ""Finally"" because of the house music groundbreaker for her. This disc also includes the album version of ""Finally"" but if you would enjoy a shorter version of the 12"" version of ""Finally"" and omit the album version and the song ""House Party"" and add 8 more songs to the disc, get Ce Ce Peniston's ESSENTIAL disc, import. You get more of her than just these."
5,"OH, MY WHAT A GREAT CD!!",THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST! CECE IS NOT FORGOTTEN! I TRULY ENJOYED THE LISTEN & IT'S GETTING IT'S WORKOUT AT WORK ALSO! TO REMINENSCE WHILE LISTENING MADE IT ALL WORTHWHILE! THANKS!
2,Floors in middle break easily,This dollhouse was easy to assemble. However it is poorly made. I purchased it for my 3 and 4 year old children. They have broken the floor out of the middle level and broke several pieces of furniture. The bathroom tub and the toilet are the two pieces that broke first.
3,Source code no longer available,"I bought this book as it had spelt out a solution in the text and reffered to the source code suppossedly online. Tried witht eh publisher for many weeks to get the source code as promised to no avail. A good overview, but no real depth."
5,Great buy!,"Excellent product, especially for it's money. There's no need to purchase the ""Apple"" charger, this is actually a better product - it lets you know using red/green lights when your ipod is done charging."
4,too digital?,"I just got this cd from my grandmother for christmas. I must say no amount of merzbow is ever going to make me tolerant of his music but I thought this was some how more digital and computered than the all out hate-static-insanity that Merzbow put into older tracks like black cat and pulsedemon. But in the case of Iron, Glass, Bricks and White Lights the digital effects seem to give a comical edge. In any case Merzbow is not something that is to be taken lightly. Also songs like 1930 make me wonder what on earth happend on that fateful year to cause such insanity.Enjoy..."
5,Relaxing......,I love love love these coloring books! My favorite thing about these books is that are good enough to frame when you done with the picture!Colored pencils work best on these books!!Relaxing coloring book for adults!!! I'm a mom of 2 and at the end of the day this is my escape...Recommend to all adults ...men and women!Please let me know if my review helped you in your purchase !
2,Weak markings and no I.D. measurment,The markings are weak and hard to see.There is no I.D. measurement.The slide is very inconsistent along the length of travel.
5,A great performance of Spem In Alium,"I have several versions of the beautiful sacred piece SPEM IN ALIUM, and this version by The Pro Cantione Antiqua is very special. The choirs are so massed that it seems to be coming from over a thousand voices. Extra special."
3,Only for the True Lover of Baking,"This book is beautiful, HOWEVER, you end up making 6 cups of buttercream for a recipe that calls for only one cup. You have 5 cups of extra buttercream in your fridge! As well, ganache, heavy syrup, and glaze.I do not have enough expertise to reduce the recipes, and the book does not help. Most items made only last a week in your fridge, so I will have to make at least 3 more cakes this week in order to use up everything! The ideas and instructions are easy to follow, but it really is for the true lover of baking."
5,Great value,I originally started with bare minerals from their infomercial but when you order you are automatically enrolled in their auto ship program. You can choose how often you want to receive it but it is still over $60 when you get it and the jars are very small. They also included 2 colors of foundation one of which I didn't like. I was so happy to discover this product on Amazon. You get the 9oz. size for a great price in my opinion and it lasts for a long time. The product itself I love and hope they always make it for I can't imagine going back to regular foundation and powder. I have tried buying mineral products at Wal-Mart but have not found anything compared to the quality of Bare Minerals. It really provides good coverage and looks natural. I do have to touch up every so often but that is no big deal. I highly recommend this product.
1,Not the product I ordered,"The item I received is not the product I ordered. I ordered Bare Minerals Mineral Veil and I received two small sample size containers of Bare Escentuals Mineral Veil. The picture associated with this item clearly says ""Bare Minerals"" on the item yet that's not what it is. This is important as Bare Escentuals adds various chemicals to their original product line whereas no chemicals are added to their Bare Minerals product line. I'm extremely sensitive to chemicals so this is a huge issue for me. Also, the ingredients this seller lists for the product are different than the ingredients listed on the product I received (the one I received having chemicals included in the product list). Again, this is because they sent me Bare Escentuals instead of Bare Minerals. Very frustrating to say the least."
1,I NEVER RECIED THIS PRODUCT I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS ON BACK ORDER I WOULD LIKE TO RECIE THE PRODUCT SO I CAN TRY IT,LIKE I SAID I NEVER RECIED THIS PRODUCT SO I CANT WRITE A REVEIW ON SOMETHING I NEVER GOT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH MY ORDER
5,like this product,I have been using this light weight product to use over my foundation & blush. It works very well - blends in with my complexion color.
3,OK but not for a natural look,This product is good it is very shimmery though defiantly not what someone would want if they are going for a more natural look finishing look. I don't use as much on my face as I wanted to with a finishing powder. I would recommend just putting it on the top of your cheek bones to catch the light and have a pretty shimmery glow. But you don't need that much if that is all you want from this product then you could just get a smaller size a little bit shows a lot with this product
5,Great Artists,This band is extremely talented. It disgusts me that radio wasn't playing this when it came out. I had to discover them on XM. I always loved Trip to the Fair but until you hear Scheherazade you haven't heard the full spectrum of the talents of Renaissance.
1,dont buy this,"This book is a joke, it shows hundreds of pages of worthless technical information with no reference to any practical modeling. Margaret should read 3d studio workshop by Duane Loose to see how a tutorial should be written. Save your cash."
1,Vulgar,"Inside the badly airbrushed cover lurks one of the most vulgar films since the 40 year old virgin (and at least that was funny at times). A would-be indie knockoff of Hitch with a weak storyline, the story tells of some guy who's name i fail to remeber (played by Daivd Boreanaz) who gets nerdy guys girls- erm i mean who gets girls to get back with their loser boyfriend by teaching them how to be less nerdy- I mean by dating them and becoming the epitome of their loser boyfriend so the girls will get together with their loser boyfriends. (so you know David's gonna be getting a lot of action...) Of course he falls in love with one of his clients girlfriends and must make a choice between her and the money he would have gotten to buy a dirtbike (and if someone had to choose between men and a bike I would definatly dump the loser...) I succeeded watching this for all of 10 minutes. Please don't waste your time on this trash!"
3,Luxury pillow overstuffed,This pillow is really overstuffed. It should last for a good while. For the price I think I got a good deal.
3,Good and ?,"The Magic Tree House books are the first books my 9 year old son has really taken an interest in reading, although most younger children could read them easily. For this, I love them. They also, while not being entirely accurate, do a terrific job of whetting an interest in history. My ONLY concern is the use of Morgan le Fay of Camelot as the kids beautiful and smart leader -- because in the Arthur legends she is a witch, mother of Arthur's malevolent son Mordred, and Arthur's half-sister at the same time. None of this is in these children's books, of course, but I don't like my children led to admire someone who, legend has, was so ... evil."
5,Love this!,I bought it to use on my face. It's doesn't get all my makeup off right away but eventually my face is squeaky clean. The rose scent is amazing. I will buy again.
2,Weird,"I rather generously gave this CD 2 stars due to the talents of the best in the genre. My argument is that the sountrack is somewhat between pseudo-authentic and slick Nashville. I do not believe that the majority of the soundtrack was consistent with the tenor of the film. There is a plethora of music available that is good old-timey or slick made to sell. This seemed like a hodgepodge thrown together because some people believe that a soundtrack must accompany a movie. I realize that tracks containing cylinder recordings of authentic British Isles music would be a hard sell. I think the CD should be entitled ""Contemporary Adaptations of Original Folksongs"". At least that would be more honest. After viewing the film, my expectations of the CD were not realized."
3,Songcatcher not caught,"Though I knew this was not the actual soundtrack, I was still disapointed. I had hoped that the movie's original songs would be intack and by the artists of the movie. Only a few are here. The songs as they were heard in the movie were magnificent. The abscence of music and/or the limited background music gave the listener an opportunity to hear the beauty of the voices and the songs unfettered. Hearing the remakes was a big letdown. Sorry Emmy Lou Harris, Patti Loveless........the movie's beautiful renditions were better left alone."
2,A huge disappointment!,"As good as the movie ""Songcatcher"" was, you'd think the CD would be equally inspiring. But the reviews I read were correct -- the CD is not so good. I rated it two stars, for the two songs on the entire CD that I enjoyed."
2,Where are the real songs?,"While this soundtrack is a likable record with wonderful performances, I can't say that I would recommend it. I loved the songs and the singing in the movie, but those pieces are not to be found (or at least rarely found) on this soundtrack. ""Oh Death"", ""Barbara Allen"" (a snippet), and a piece sung by Iris DeMent are the only songs from the movie. All the other songs are highly produced, slick versions by wonderful, but all too modern artists. Give me Hazel Dickens or more from Iris and I'd send everyone out to get it. And, please, can anyone tell me why the two pieces from the score are included here. David Mansfield is a gifted musician and composer, but these pieces fall on the ear like lead and disrupt the flow of the album. The producers dropped the ball on this one. One quick glimpse at Songcatcher 2 tells me that it is already a better bet than this one."
5,Gorgeous new and old music,"Songcatcher has long been a favorite movie of mine for so many reasons--of course the beautiful music, but also the historical significance and some favorite actors and performers who were in the movie. But, it wasn't until recently that I discovered this album--where have I been??! The music couldn't be more beautiful, it's so deep and lyrical and full of emotion. For the reviewers who said this album was a dissapointment because it didn't feature every song from the movie--I think that's unfair as there are plenty of songs from the movie, but it also has other amazing ballads that are just in the album. This album makes me want to dig my banjo out of the closet, get on the first plane to Ashville, and live in a world of ""old timey"" bluegrass forever."
5,"""Wind and Rain"" by Gillian Welch & David Rawlings","I'm not going to write a lot since that's ""what I do"" in life, and one can only do so much of it with the fingers one was provided with. What I am going to say is that I love the movie (rent it, buy it, see it), and have no objection to this ""inspired by"" CD. Here's the important part: Nobody has commented on Gillian Welch & David Rawlings ""Wind and Rain."" It is staggering, a juxtaposition of beauty and horror like few others. (The old song ""Greenwood Sidee"" as performed by the ancient band The Kaleidoscope comes to mind.) If you do not know Gillian Welch, start here, start anywhere, but start now. It will be (to borrow the title of one of her CD's) a ""soul journey."""
2,NOT THE MUSIC FROM THE MOVIE,"I purchased the CD because I really liked the music in the movie. I was disappointed that only 4 of the songs on the recording reflected the music I heard in the movie. Most of the music in the film was acappella, while most on the CD was not. I expected the music on the CD to reflect the music in the movie in both style and content. It failed to do so."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"First off, five stars to Ms. Arnauth for what I feel certain is another amazing album. I have heard her in person, and have listened to other albums of hers, and she is AMAZING.Sadly, EMI has chosen to implement copy protection technology on this album which prevents me from playing it in my car, or on my PC using my MusicMatch Jukebox player. This is in direct violation of the ""fair use"" act established by the Federal Government that protects the right of individuals to make a backup copy of their media, and it also violates common sense when it makes it impossible to play the CD on the only two players available to me. Thanks EMI - brilliant decision. At this point, I'll be purchasing no more music on the EMI label, no matter how much I admire the artist."
5,Up from the sea...,"Swervedriver are the type of band that gets better and better with age.Sadly, they didn't catch on enough to sustain beyond 4 studio lps...but Adam Franklin has continued the arc that began with raise...and culminated with 99th dream...in Toshack Highway (they are also worth repeated listens).The swervies will forever be one of my favorite bands...and this lp is their much underappreciated swansong. 99th dream, up from the sea and these times are the highlights...weaving textures of sound and fury and pathos.Call me biased, call me sentimental...just don't call me while I'm listening to my swervedriver cds."
4,Buy it on sale! Use the parts to make a BETTER Jack Sparrow,"I admit it. I bought this guy on sale. Then I took off all his clothes, tore off his head, repainted the head and hat, then customized it to fit onto a BBI (that's a brand name) body.Why?The Zizzle bodies suck. They don't pose well at all. They should come with a stand, because the ankles in the part-of-the-leg-itself boots aren't always sturdy enough to hold up that big honkin' body.The outfit is awesome. For that price point, it's worth the cost just to get the clothing, accesories, head, and hat.If you don't care about posing him and how accurate his face paint is...just set him up and roll. If you like having a version of him that's pretty cool (for a geek like me), take him apart and make him better. If you get him on sale- it's worth it."
2,Vinotemp - Not worth the low price,"I would not buy another Vinotemp. I have been disappointed from day 1 -it's too noisy for a kitchen and the temperature fluctuates at least 10 degrees day to day. It seams to have a mind of its own deciding what temperature to stay at. I don't mean between the top and bottom, the thermometer I'm using to check its accuracy is in the middle and doesn't get moved. I've called them and their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Spend the extra $$$ and get a quality wine fridge - you'll be much happier in the long run.Delta Mike"
1,Nothing here that is memorable.,"I bought this CD because I read some glowing reviews of this act. I'm sorry to say I don't agree. After a few plays of this CD nothing I heard makes me want to ever play it again. These songs just float by without anything being memorable about the songs or the performances. After a few listens I can't remember one song on here. The songs sound ""almost"" complete, like it is missing something. I really wanted to like this stuff but it doesn't work for me."
2,"Should be called ""An adequate London walk""","When you have the audacity to call something ""perfect"", you should make more of an effort to merit the title.This is a nice little book, and the walk is lovely, but I have seen much better books (and walks). What does make this book charming is that one can imagine walking with Mr. Curley, hearing him recite the literary passages presented here and seeing the sites discussed; indeed, one need not depend solely on imagination since there are a generous number of (black-and-white) photographs included. A very good map of the area is included.But the book fails as either a ramble or a tour guide. If it is a ramble, let there be more narrative; if it is a guidebook, then let there be more information.Taking the walk with Mr. Curley is undoubtedly a wonderful experience. Unfortunately this book does not capture that experience."
1,Another stab at the rich and famous,"F. Scott Fitzgerald is unique among the great American writers in that his most famous works examine the lives of the wealthy elite. This book looks at the Hollywood set of the 1930's, when sound was becoming an integral part of movies, but color was still beyond the horizon. The movie business is big enough and profitable to be respectable and even appealing in the public eye, but also enough to spawn rivalries and politicking among and within the major studios. It is this seamy, backstabbing side of Hollywood examined here. Again, many of the characters have major flaws that make the reader go ""what is he thinking"". Alcohol, jealousy, and envy drive this book, making it quit similar to the other works by Fitzgerald. I did not enjoy this book, and found it quite boring. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Disappointment,"Pop songs showing that the group did not know what direction to take. With the loss of Terence Sullivan and John Tout, from Camera Camera 2 years before, the songs presented lacks the creativity of yore, and I, as a big fan of the band, I was disappointed with this release. I bought it just to complete the collection."
2,not their best,"Commercial and overproduced, Renaissance's last album is not their best moment. It seemed to bear little resemblance to the neoclassical group that did ""Scheherazade"" and ""Ashes are Burning."" The sound is very 80's, digital, and dated, and the songs sound like leftovers from the Motels or any of the subpar synthpop bands of the decade. Annie Haslam's voice is the only thing of note here, and it's wasted on these dreadful songs. You would be better advised to buy any of their first four albums to hear them at their best."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"Don't do business with this company....I purchased a different Vinotemp model...Mine lasted 5 months before it stopped cooling. It was under warranty. I spoke to customer service. The only way to get it serviced or replaced was if I paid to ship the defective item to them from Oklahoma to California. I didn't agree with this policy and this was not disclosed on the warranty terms that came with this product. I was transferred to the voicemail box of whom I was told was the company president. I expressed my displeasure and requested a call back. No call back was received. Terrible customer service. Given the cost of shipping a large, heavy item over that distance, a person would probably be better off just buying a new wine cooler from a company that stands behind their products."
2,Good for tech fans,"Clogged with technical jargon and stilted writing, an admirable aping of early Tom Clancy. The story is a little too far-fetched, which could have been overlooked if the language in the book wasn't so clunky. More like a screenplay than a novel. Nice try, though."
1,Overly simplistic world,"I plodded through to the end of this book, hoping that Mr. Head's writing style and depiction of the world would break out of the simplistic. I was disappointed. The world and the motivations of the humans that live in it, both in positions of power and among the common folk, are much, much more complex than in this book. The only redeeming quality of the book is as the basis to some hypothetical wargame scenarios (say for Harpoon 4). Otherwise, you won't lose anything by not reading it. You're better off buying a good history book for the money."
3,No scissors.,"My fault I didn't look closely, but there are no scissors with this model. I should have bout Classic version."
3,The Corner Office is better,This book is good ( a lot of common sense and good sense of humor) but the Corner Office is better
4,Cute read!,"Return Engagement was the story of the reuniting on stage two child TV stars in a small town in Missouri. When Noah last saw Lindsey, he left her in a world of hurt and it follows the pair 15 years later as they try to sort out their feelings for one another.I found Return Engagement to be a very cute, heartwarming story. I definitely enjoyed the antics of the two main characters as well as most of Lindsey's family. The only part I found a little ""off"" was the two villains: Lindsey's sister, Jolie and Lindsey's mother, Vivian (or Vivienne as she likes to be called). I know they were supposed to be mean and ruthless, but there was absolutely no redeeming qualities to them. After awhile it made me question why bother associating with them at all.Aside from that minor detail, Return Engagement was a good book and worth the read. I enjoyed it very much."
3,Interesting,I was disapointed in the book. Kind of boring. I expected a lot more. Eleanor Roosevelt was a great woman. Her book dos not really show that.
4,cheap but great for gluing,these are much less expensive than the ones at the big box stores. work fine for me for glue application
4,Works great,"used to seperate my ignition keys from my house/work keys - they hold very well. The spring clip is pretty small, and it took me a little while to get the correct finger feel for opening it.. but now i can easily clip and un-clip from my belt loop."
1,An incredible disappointment.,"This CD was an extreme disappointment. I figured I couldn't go wrong with having 2 CDs. However, there weren't any good songs worth listening to on either CD (except maybe one...and it's not that great). Don't buy this CD. If you're looking for some good relaxing music from Higher Octave, check out the band Mythos."
3,Could have been less technical,"This book would have been more accurately titled "" 176 pages of technical reasons why you can't build a dinosaur."" I realize that these are complex issues, but it was still quite dry in places. On the other hand, I did read the whole thing. I guess I was hoping they would say that bringing a dinosaur back was just around the corner."
1,Terrible,"It's very simple: if you're going to make a language CD, you should damn well know how to pronounce it correctly. The Chinese speaker on the CD is fine, but the American (Dr. Blair?) makes gross mispronunciations every sentence or two.I'd rate it lower than one star if I could... if you pattern your speaking after him, the only people that will be able to understand your Mandarin (as my Chinese teacher used to say) is you and your dog. It's not just bad, but it's actively harmful to your efforts to learn the language correctly.Only audio CD I've ever returned."
1,Sorry...,"I bought this due to a review I read. I had an open mind, but it just wasn't a worthwhie purchase. No memorable tunes, nothing memorable to say. Don't do it."
3,It's Ok,I had to read this book for my Shakespeare class because they talk about Shakespearean Theatre and what not. It's a mystery novel with some accurate history in it though.
1,Disappointment,"I saw this space heater and thought it would be perfect. The problem I have with it is that the heat only comes out of a 6 inch area at the top of the heater, but it has a grill that would make you believe that the heat would come out of the whole front of the unit. It does get very warm and has great safety features, but it doesn't give off enough heat to warm people sitting 2 feet from the unit."
4,Love Johnny Western,"We have really enjoyed listening to this collection. Unfortunately, two of the discs, while they play fine at home, do not play on the car stereo -- which is a disappointment. Nevertheless, we are not sorry for the purchase. We love Johnny Western's rich, round voice."
1,Edited badly,"A MUPPET FAMILY CHRISTMAS is a truely enjoyable special, but instead of buying this DVD, I suggest you tape it off of TV the next time the Hallmark Channel shows it.Why?Because this DVD is edited. These aren't just minor edits, but entire scenes are cut out and the edits are extremely noticeable. It seems that Sony couldn't be bothered to get the rights for some copyrighted Christmas songs to release this unedited. Well then, I can't be bothered to get the DVD, and neither should anyone else who cares about what he/she is watching."
2,Very disappointing,"My husband recorded the Muppet Christmas from TV when the kids were little and we watched it every, single year. (Sometimes numerous times in one season, on car trips, at grandparents houses, etc.) It was fun and very enjoyable since the Muppets have great kid appeal and we remembered watching the Muppets as kids. Unfortunately, our old VHS tape, complete with commercials is worn out and we wanted a DVD version. I purchased this last year and was tremendously disappointed to see that some of our ABSOLUTE FAVORITE quirky moments of the show were completely cut out and were not even in the extra features. My favorite joke, ""It's Reindeer""... ""No, it's snow, darling!"" was cut out as well as the muppet baby film and some other really fantastic jokes and ridiculous slips on the icy patch.If you've never watched this in any other form, you'll love it, it's still very cute and heart warming. For those of us who know it by heart, it is a tremendous disappointment."
3,Very disappointing DVD!!,I am highly disappointed not only was I not aware that this DVD had scenes cut from it so when watching was in total shock to find them missing but to see others have found out as well the hard way. The wonderful scene with Fozzy bear and the snowman cut is horrible that was one of my favorite scenes and to have the scene with the home movies so horribly cut it's obvious as well well I think the company should have at least told us on the packaging that scenes were deleted due to copyright problems so that customers were aware of this now I own a DVD I most likely will NEVER EVER watch again. Thanks a lot to whomever decided to produce this horrible DVD!!! Make it all intact or not at all. Makes me wonder if I can find the same things with the other Muppets DVDs as well. If you want the entire movie as is intact DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. A wonderful movie ruined i'm crushed.
3,The Jim Henson Company,"I contacted the Jim Henson Company about this problem yesterday. They said It is true that the recorded release of ""A Muppet Family Christmas"" is shorter than was the broadcast special. The original agreement that was made for the music of this special was for broadcast television only. Subsequently, when they tried to arrange for the home video they were not allowed to release it unless certain selections were removed. This situation, which currently remains unchanged, is regrettable both to them and to their many friends who have been disappointed with their purchase. They are attempting to cope with these restrictions, but so far without success."
2,Horrible edits destroy a beloved classic special.,"One has to wonder about the reasoning behind removing so much of this wonderful special's original material from this DVD release. I have my original copy that I taped off of television way back in the mid 80's, and I'd rather watch THAT, fuzzy degrading, annoying Osh Kosh commercials, and all...at least it's INTACT. Not only have several songs been removed, but the final pay-off to a VERY long running gag (the icy patch) ended up on the cutting room floor, as well, being that it was at the very end of Piggy's song (""Home for the Holidays"", cut out). The editing is SO bad, you can actually TELL where things were removed. Such a shame. Here's hoping the matter can be settled, and a fully-restored version offered...though I wouldn't hold my breath. After all, there are MANY more Muppet television specials that have disappeared into the mists of time, as well."
3,"Muppet Family Christmas to air Dec 22nd, 2002","I somehow missed this special growing up, and I am a rabid muppet fan. So this version is decent enough for never having seen the original, but I would much rather have it uncut as Jim Henson intended it. That said, I have done a little research and found that the special will be showing on December 22nd at 6 p.m. on the Hallmark Channel (formerly Odessey channel, I think). I have no idea if it is the original or not, but I am hoping it will be. Check your local listings to be sure; I could not verify the time so don't hold me responsible if it's not correct! I hope this helps anyone looking to see the correct version like I am. Best of luck and here's hoping it's the right one!"
3,disapointed!,"I also recorded this video from televison years ago. I loaned it out and never had it returned. There are several omitions that my children, who are now young adults, miss. You put a song in and took acouple of great ones out. Why can't we have them all? This is a great holiday movie. High quality and warming. But lets get the omitted pieces back!"
5,my family's favorite,"I grew up loving the Muppets and when this came our after years of no Muppet Show we thought it was the best as it has all of the Muppets and Sesame and Fraggle gang. My parents have a vhs of this but i have moved and would love to see it again.ALLIE- where did you ever get the computer version. i would like it, how do i email you?if you can get your hands on this it's great!"
3,Good Copy,"Advertised as new DVD for $99.00, but I believe it is a good copy. Wrapper was intact but jacket cover was definatly copied and printed. Was not high quality DVD jacket. Only features on DVD were play and sceen selections. No other feature selections were on disc as jacket described. Movie played fine and clear."
2,"This Christmas Special Is Now Edited On DVD, Video Tape and TV!",I love this Chrsitmas special or at least the original uncut version and I have to agree with all of the reviewers who said that it really stinks that they decided to release this on DVD and video with things edited out. It's missing the delightful scene where Fozzy is singing and dancing with a snowman and telling his corny jokes. Some reviewers are saying to just record this when it's shown on TV because on TV you will get the whole thing but I don't think they realized that the TV rerun broadcasts are also edited so unless you managed to record the original broadcast you will just see the edited one!
2,Parts Missing,"Like everyone else, I am disappointed that there are parts missing from the video version of the show. Luckily I was able to find the original one on Limewire and download it for free. It's the one that is 587 MB. Hope this can help some other people get the real version!!"
3,A great Muppet special in a disappointing package,"This is one of the best specials the Muppets ever did and marked the last time the Muppets were all together before Jim Henson died. Too bad, then, that this release edits out several scenes shown on TV: the Muppet babies singing in home movies, Rowlf and Sprocket at the piano, Fozzie's duet with a snowman. The result is a choppy version that doesn't do justice to the talented people who created this program. A disappointment to anyone who is used to getting MORE on a DVD-- this version provides LESS."
4,christmas,LOOKS GREAT. I WILL WATCH THE DVD tommarow. IM AM VARY EXCITED. i am so happy i bought this dvd
2,Muppet Family Christmas all chopped up!,"This awesome made for TV movie has been shredded to pieces! The once 50 min long show jam packed with Muppety action has a whole 8 min of beautiful songs and moments taken away. I suggest not wasting your money on something that isn't complete. I'd rather watch a crummy quality FULL version of this classic any day! The fact that there are no extra features would be fine with me, as long as there was the Snow Man song with Fozzie, Miss Piggy's entrance song, Rowlf the Dog with his ""Outta tune piana..."" and the complete medley at the end of the movie! If these scenes wer e included I would most definitely give the movie 5 stars, but without them it only deserves 2..."
3,Almost made a purchasing mistake,"I've seen the original of this movie many, many times and my copy is getting old, so I decided to buy a fresh new one. But, after reading the reviews about how it had been cut, I decided NOT to buy it. I will just stick to the old one until an ""uncut"" version comes out. Thank you to all of you who were honest enough to help me to NOT make a purchasing mistake. I rated this video 3 stars because, whatever is there, is probably entertaining if you did not see the original version."
1,Look for UK or Dutch versions,"Several others have documented all of the scenes that are missing from the US version. Search for this on e B a y - look for DVDs that have R2, UK or Dutch in the description. These versions have all of the scenes and are in English. The catch is that the DVDs are coded for Region 2 (US DVD players are Region 1) and are in the PAL format (US is NTSC).If you can get your computer's DVD player to play Region 2, your system will play the PAL format just fine. If you want to watch this on a traditional DVD player, you will need to either get a region-free player or convert it over to NTSC.The good news is that these versions are priced fairly reasonable on e B a y and the shipping cost was lower than I expected. You just need to wait 2-3 weeks for it to arrive."
3,Please restore scenes!,"This is a great Christmas movie for all of us Muppet fans. However, you would think by now they would realize that people are a little upset by the deleted scenes. I still have my old copy off of television from years ago and find myself watching this version rather than the ""edited"" VHS which is the same as the DVD. It's a shame."
3,"plenty images, too clearly text","Milikowski et Berman's Atlas has a lot of full-coloured images(over 1000 images!), taken at microscopic level. Although every image has text for explanation, it is so simply written(20-30 words) that it is not easy for me, a beginner at histo-pathology, to understand well."
2,No Good Once out of Infant Carriers!!!!!,"I loved this stroller while my twin girls were still in their infant carriers. The 'click and go' feature was a lifesaver, it rode really nicely, manuevered well, and I really thought that the $270 was worth it. However, once I put them in the regular seats, I once again was reminded that 'you get what you pay for'. The fact that the seats have only a 3 point harness over the lap instead of a 5 point harness to include the shoulder area is a real safety hazard. Right about the time babies are ready to graduate from the carriers to the big seats is when they are most curious, and my girls have almost leaned right over the side on to the concrete a couple of times because the 3 point harnesses does not contain them.I would advise against this stroller, and recommend to make sure you get a stroller with a 5 point harness-no matter what age your child is. I can't believe this manufacturer didn't think that a 5 point harness was worth it!!!!!"
2,not a snap to go,"We just got this stroller as a baby shower gift for the twin boys we are expecting. Although my husband has the strength to snap the car seats in and out, I can't seem to get the hang of it. I also can't lift the stroller once it's folded. Now I'm beginning to panic about ever leaving the house once the boys arrive."
2,low quality for the price,We bought this 18 months ago when we had our second baby because I wanted a travel system with tandem seating and cup holders. Here's what I didn't like about it. 1.the seats are really small both in width and height. 2.This stroller is really heavy and takes up a huge amount of room in my suv! 3. hard to stear and the big wheels get caught on everything. 4.Car seat is fine but when used in the back you can't even see the baby with the canapy folded. 5.very flimsy my sister in law broke one of the wheels putting it in the trunk and we had to pay to replace it. We're now expecting our 3rd and have just bought a used peg perego and love it. It folds up much smaller is much lighter and easier to steer and the seats are huge. I don't even miss the cup holders.
2,Not worth it.,"I watched all of season 1 and half of season 2 because of the reviews I read on here saying it was so funny and so good. I kept hoping something would happen to explain those statements. It didn't. There are only two things good about this show. 1 each episode is short, and 2 Felicia Day. Her character is endearing but beyond that this is not a good show. I understand this is a parody of gamers but the characters are not likeable AT ALL, and not funny. Maybe I just don't get it because I'm not a gamer but for the average veiwer I'd suggest watching something else."
5,History and human relationships all tied together,"This is my first exposure to Randy Ingermanso, but you can be assured it will not be my last. He has proven to be a most talented writer as well as an excellent ancient historian in this book, Premonition.I don't usually enjoy books on time travel and such, and didn't exactly know what to expect from Premonition. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The time travel aspect was not flaunted, and I felt like I had indeed been transported back in time through my reading. I ""met"" many old Bible friends in the unfolding of the story of Rivka and Ari, time travellers to ancient Jerusalem.I felt the story was as true to ancient history as we are able to be. THe frequent references to modern conveniences that Rivka wished she had access to did not in any way deter from the ancient setting.I highly recommend this book. I am very impressed with what Ingermanson has done, in a genre I don't usually even read."
5,Beautiful piece of jewelry for horse lovers,It was simply very elegant and my best friend loved it as a birthday gift. Would purchase one for myself maybe for Christmas next year....
5,"well, so far so good","i mean, so far it's definitely working. i needed more space, it's giving me more space. i've been working it fairly regularly for about a month and a half now and it hasn't given me any problems. i love it. exactly what i needed."
4,Good but not the best,"This is the one of many muppet specials that was made during the 1980's. There were several of these. This is one of the weaker ones. Compared to the other ones that were made this one is, well, not that good. BUT, compared to the other children specials out there this is a very well done show. It is based on the secret life of toy during one particular christmas season. This show has heart and is extremly entertaning. It spawned a short tv show on the disney channel and some people think it was the inspiration for the disney movie toy story. This is a exellent video to get to learn about the muppet creations besides the muppet show and is also a good holiday video for kids. However, if any of the other specials are avliable I suggest getting those."
2,Who want's to be a 'wacky' morning DJ?,"Being somewhat of an amateur audiophile, I decided to plunk down my money and check this out. I was pretty disappointed with this CD. The tracks listed that show a popular figure speaking a famous line from a TV show or movie are not the actual individual speaking the line, but someone doing a rather lame impersonation. This seems like a bit of false advertising to me, to list the track and then the name of the star, but oh well. For the price being charged for this collection, you should get the real deal, but you don't. There are some OK bits on here, but not enough for me to recommend someone purchasing this CD. You'd probably be better off finding or recording the material yourself, and saving the money. I won't be buying any more of these."
4,Wey Hey !,Good content - I want the others in the collection - Mail Me if you know where I can get them !
1,Not very helpful,"Doesn't add anything new to the world of manners. If you care enough about manners to want to read a book on it, you probably already know everything in this book"
4,A Fantastic Horror Film,"Wow, this movie was wowtastic. I loved it so much. If you want to see a well written, exciting, fast paced movie, this is the movie for you. I watched it over and over again with my friend Airin, Cuthrine, and Ahlly. It was spectacular, magnificent, and smelled wonderful. The smells from this movie were excellent. It had a nice textture too. Your truly, Gertrude Verjinya Elizabeth Phluddgentcent"
2,Could be better.,"The idea of it is good.(storage wise) My boys like the launcher. My problem with it is that it is poorly made. The handle cracked during delivery, although they did replace it quickly. The wheels on it don't turn easily. The storage capacity is great if your children have a lot of cars like we do."
4,hotwheels carrying case with wheels (100 car) with launcher,item shipped quickly. case brand new. only complaint (not sellers fault) is that the wheels do not work well. the left wheel doesn't move. item is supposed to be a carrying case with handle and wheels but it's a bit difficult for a child to maneauver.seller sold product brand new so i do not place the blame there.
4,just what we needed,Product is exactly as described. My 6 year old son loves it and it is a good way to keep his cars all together and easy to get to.
4,hot wheels rollin ' 100 car case launcher,"very handy when children have lots of hot wheels that need storing in between uses, and the wheels makes it much easier for my son to roll around to change his playing station for his car collection."
2,they could have done a better job ...,i got the 48-piece first (no wheels) and i thought the one with wheels will be better but it is not. it is nice looking case but inside there are all different shapes and in my opinion that it is a not a plus. they could have made a 96-piece and just join two of the 48-piece and put wheels.
4,Grandson Loved It!,Nice item for the money.Good to keep all your cars in order.Helps keep Matchbox cars in order.Good for the kids to learn to put toys away.
1,avoid,"I only got this becuase I liked ""A Famous Myth,"" which was the easy listening vocal piece in Midnight Cowboy. The song was melodic and had a vaugely interesting flair to it. So, once I found out the Groop was, well, a group, and not just a soundtrack creation, I decided to check them out.But most of this is mid-60s easy vocal swill, with overly pretty little flourishes and not a lot to make it compelling. Completely generic. It lacks any rock impulse and has all the spark and fire of the Letterman on qualudes. There is actually a line ""Blustery day blew my hat away."" Heavens to Betsy, not that.Pass on this.8-1-09 Nobody likes my review. I am just curious. Does somebody like this music, or am i just not being descriptive enough? I mean, has anybody actually LISTENED to this thing?"
1,Poor quality movie,"That's all I can say, just as my review headline. I was shocked at the poor quality..had I known this I would never have purchased this or the other two old flicks I purchased. I have an older set of these movies with same poor quality and thought for sure they must have upgraded the quality. Nope, terrible."
5,Very tasty book!,"I live in the same town as this author, and have experienced first-hand her delectible creations. Not only are these recipes extraordinary, they are makable and edible. True gourmet without requiring ingredients from unknown Mediterranean villages. It is very difficult to bake at 7000+ feet, and these work (each recipe has altitude instructions if necessary). Amazingly, I emailed Letty for help with cream puffs (not in the book; mine were collapsing--not only did she return my email, she offered to taste-test them. Top notch chef, person, book. If live at altitude and love refined sugar, you need this book. Wherever you live, this book will not disappoint."
1,This is a dud printer,"My father-in-law bought this printer for me less than two years ago. I had the same paper-feed problems described above (large amounts being pulled through for no reason). Eventually a sensor was damaged and it stopped working, I exchanged it within the year warranty and hoped it was a fluke. The ""new"" one that was sent had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS from the get go, and eventually stopped working as well. Unfortunately, the warranty had run out and I am now stuck with a $175. paper weight.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am teaching myself and my sons!!! This is very thorough and easy to follow!!! Awesome, I'm saving a lot of money on introductary piano lessons. Will enroll the boys when we finish this program and they still show interest."
4,Sehr schon,"An item for the uber-collector, a set of vintage pieces and one more recent cut of Helen Shapiro performing her '60s pop standards in German, French and English. More detailed liner notes would have been a nice addition."
2,Bleh,"I bought this game because it was on sale, I am glad I did. The graphics are really good but that is where the good part ends. There is no way to change the controller, your shooters can't hit a 3 point shot to save thier lives yet the AI can, the recruiting is horrible. This is a bad game by EA, don't waste your money."
2,Hard but fun,This game is a huge challenge to play. I play it every so often. Think before you buy this game. NCCA Marchmadness 07 is a alright game. The order shipped on time and arrived on time. Shop smart when buying video games on Amazon.com.
1,A Sad Day For Movie Distribution,"Easily one of the worst ten films ever distributed. Do yourself a favor and don't waste an hour and a half of your life watching this because you can never get it back,Purchase a classy teenage comedy instead. That movie is better known as 'Zapped'."
3,lacks complexity!,"This album is listenable. In fact too listenable! Although there are traces of genius here, the overall impression is that of someone making music without any challenges for the listener. The drumming is also too simple and has too much presence when it is there at all.. The few snippets of sampling are also useless. I can also hear anoying hissing on tracks 2 and the 3 last ones. Very disapointed since I consulted these Amazon ratings to choose this Cd."
1,Yawn...yawn,"ok, i know there are many people out there who worship this guy and i have to say that all of his other stuff is amazing. he can shred and that's what i dig. but, i heard about this record and thought, ""hey something new."" i owned the cd and placed it in my player expecting mind-blowing speed from the man raised by chickens, but instead i promptly fell asleep. after forced listening, i found myself wondering why someone with so much talent would be reduced to nothing but an endless barage of loops and delays. well, it shouldn't be surprising anymore. just look what happened to robert fripp."
4,I'm sure this product is great...but...,"My daughter loved to play this playmat at a friend's house. I especially liked the quality because as you might be aware with these playmats, the paint chips off some of the cheaper brands. I ordered it, but the supplier stopped producing them, and I wasn't fortunate enough to get one. If you can find one, buy it if your child loves this concept. My daughter began to like this at 33 months, and her friends were up to age 8...so a good investment. Don't buy the cheaper brands---Little Tikes makes one of the best car playmats."
2,not useful as i thought...,"I have a 15 lb dog and I originally purchased this since i thought i would have better control of it than using a toothbrush. However, after using a toothbrush, i have realized that i was wrong. this finger brush is ""one size fits all"" and was too big for my fingers(i have decent size hand) I wouldn't recommend it, especially for smaller dogs that have smaller mouth.. i don't think this will even fit into really small dogs."
2,almost useless,"way to small wont even fit my pinky finger, my index finger is 7/8 wide and 1.5in to the first joint, where can I find a finger brush that fits ,I need these for my 10 year old Miniature Dachshund ,I am using a baby tooth brush now."
3,"BEWARE the ""Look Inside!"" pics--Not P/V/G book","The book as it is for Easy Piano was sufficient to have fun with sing-alongs. However, the ""Look Inside"" pics would lead one to believe they are getting the full piano/vocal/guitar chord diagrams and you are NOT getting that with this book."
2,ABBA Piano music could be better,"This music book was a disappointment. The ""easy piano"" is too easy so the harmonies of ABBA do not come through."
3,meaning?,I've studied most of my life and have always cross-studied by sleeping and singing. I found that this book challenged my strength and organization of meaning.
3,Made in China,"I just received the mallet and right out of the package noted the cracked and marred handle, which is made of two pieces. I then tested the mallet and so far the defects seem only cosmetic. Since this item was made in China, the defects are not surprising. What is surprising is the cost, it is certainly not worth the nearly $25 I paid, which includes shipping. I think it's worth about $15 including shipping since it's made in China, and if it breaks I'll replace it with a different brand."
1,"Sitck with radio, hon.","Sorry, but I am NOT feeling Angie Martinez as a rapper. Talk about lack of originalty! It seems like she trying to be a female Jay-Z. And she uses the 'n' too much, which is offensive to me as an African American. If she sells, it's because of marketing, looks, and not talent. Boo hiss!"
1,she ...,i can not stand her voice. it is so annoying! after 10 seconds she gets on my nerves she seems fake too. she ain't look gangsta but she raps like she is. its a real same people try to think there cool by rappin like this. i like rap but i can't cope this at all sorry if you want lady rappers go for rah digga not lil kim or lady luck or misss e try eve
2,sheds bristles,"This brush has an acrylic rather than a wooden handle, and it sheds bristles. The acrylic contributes to static. I have had a wood-handled boar bristle brush for 8 years and expect it to last much longer than this new brush. Next time, I will make sure to buy a brush that is more durable."
2,missing one detail... THE ROOF,I guess you have to buy the sequel to find out how to build the roof.
3,wiley text,"I am currently studying for the cpa exam and wanted a book that would aid in my study. This book was NOT helpful to me at all. It was very boring, dull, and hard to read. I would love to have seen more examples in the description part of the some of the lessons/topics for discussion, however that was not the case. Total Disappointment. If you're looking for a book to review the principles and quiz yourself on the lesson previously studied. This is not it."
4,Good Review Book,"I studied with Becker the first time I took BEC, and got a 74. The second time around, I was starting to memorize questions and felt I just needed another perspective on the information. The Wiley book was good for this purpose, but I don't know how someone would pass with this book alone. Becker is far superior in terms of organization and focusing on test applicable material. Wiley was much more indepth, which was not necessary.Also there was some blatantly incorrect information in the book. This surprised me as this is the 2009 edition, and I thought everything would be up to speed. These were not huge items of information, but it did occur more than once.Overall the book was helpful, and I would recommend it as supplemental material for anyone sitting for the exam."
3,ehh loc,can sumone hook me up with the song West Covina....cuz i cant find a copy for sale...get bacc at me at bankrobber123@yahoo.com
1,unbelievable,"i still don't understand how can such a game be sold at any price! i picked this game up when i saw its colorful package. read from cover to back, i couldn't find a description of what this game realy does. it was little fishy, but want have a game on the way home, i didn't mind much. however, it turns out the package was right, there is nothing!! this game basically is a flash shooting game. you get a nicely drafted JPG back ground, drag your cursor on to some flying chichen shaped icons, and tap the D pad. if you click on the icons more than a standard, you get into a next stage, which means you get a new back ground, that's it. after you see 6, or maybe 7 pictures, DONE!! please don't buy this game, so that we can send a message to the developer that they cann't just pack something and put on shelves to get money."
4,Vans and Vanners,"The Author Arnold S. Wolfe describes the Van enthusiast as a cultural phenomenon and way of life. In 1975, about 500,000 vans were sold. These Vanner people customize the interior and artistically paint the exterior. Van groups meet and socialize and create the mobile living space lifestyle.The TV show the A-Team was an offspring of the Van culture. Hundreds of photos in both color and contrast black and white."
4,Their last good album.,"After this album, everything else is overproduced pop crap. It's really rather unfortunate. Add the Kings of Leon to the long list of artists who have sold their souls to the record industry devils. That aside this album as several really great tracks such as ""Red Morning Light"", ""Spiral Staircase"", and ""Holy Roller Novocaine"".I think that anyone who likes their newer albums should give this one a listen."
3,Really good stuff,"I like this album a lot. Kings of Leon definitely have an edge to their rock and roll. The songs are catchy and seem pretty heart felt. The guy's voice tends to get under my skin after a while, but it's not because he's a lousy singer. They seem to have style but they're not mixing it up enough. The songs are good. I hope that they stretch their wings a bit more on the next album. You should buy this one though. It's pretty solid and worth the money."
2,This isn't worth the hype.,"If you like this group you won't like my review. These guys are overrated. I just don't get the hype about this band. It seems most people are caught up in their now famous upbringing. Mythical hoohah! Look this isn't southern rock. These guys are a lame boogie band. All mumbling and murky,I keep waiting for something to rise up out of this muck but it never kicks in. The only saving grace for my two feeble stars is the song California Waiting. There are plenty of other great new bands out there with a southern rock background who get it ,It being the southern thing. Bands like Drive By Truckers and the Bottle Rockets get it with intelligence and humor. Plus they ROCK!!Save your money check and out the Truckers or the Bottle Rockets or the White Stripes or Rancid or the Wrens or anyone else..."
3,Kings Of Leon: Average,"Okay, here's the deal with Kings of Leon: they're average. That's all, just average. This doesn't mean they're terrible, but it also doesn't mean that they're amazing. The Strokes they are not, but by making that comparison, the Kings are doomed to seem bad. The Strokes are a great band. The Kings of Leon draw from a southern rock sound, but again are no Lynard Skynard. I think this is the problem with most reviews - people are going into this album expecting the Allman Brothers. Take this album as it is: in this sense it's just a decent rock album. A little loose on the lyrics and melodies, but not terrible. Buy this album if you can get it reletively cheap, and aren't too judgemental."
1,My reason for a 1 star rating...,"The only reason I give this CD a 1 is because it has no substance. Produced by Macy Gray what could you expect? Maybe If Sunshine got on board with someone else, it would not be rain! There is only one noteworthy track on the album and it's at the end of the CD... It's Crazy Love... That's right folks, if you can.. Download it... If not.. Don't buy it!"
2,Disappointing......,"Well, it seems as her two radio releases are pretty much the best songs on her album. You can certainly tell this is her first album from her voice. She can sing, but she can't SANG. I think she would benefit greatly from a voice coach, someone who could refine her voice just a little......"
3,This had so much potential!,"Im sorry to say that I seem to be in the minority... I don't disagree that ""HEARD IT ALL BEFORE"" is a strong debut single but I was a little disappointed with the album as a whole. I would seriously look at India Arie and Jill Scott before this, alot more 'soulful'."
2,"""I've Heard This All Before ""...And I Didn't Like It","I picked this cd up used and I'm glad I didn't pay full price. After listening to only 7 of the 18 tracks I was ready to either pitch it or coaster it. First of all, 18 tracks is way too many for a debut artist to put out the first time around. Especially when most of material is bland and forgettable. A six-song ep would have been fine. Throughout the songs I did hear, there was a hint of a cute riff or a chord change here and there but nothing that kept my attention. It's background music. And the lyrics aren't much either. While Anderson's vocal style is refreshingly thick and biting, these songs don't showcase it as much as bury it. Lastly, this project just doesn't have enough of a distinguihing personality. I heard lots of albums just like it-some done much better like Mary J. Blige's self-titled opus and Millie Jackson even when she's being CLEAN. Hopefully Sunshine will get a second chance to do this music thing RIGHT! Outtahea'"
4,Good Purchase,"After hearing the single Heard It All Before(which i loved), i opted to buy the album, and i have to say that i was a good csolid purchase. Featuring the UK hit single Heard It All Before and other great trcaks like Better Off, Vulnerability, Your Woman and Last night, this is definetly an album that you have never heard before. (and with Macy Gray behind her, then Sunshine has already got off to a great start)"
2,Sunshine's a little overcast,"After hearing the thumpin' lyrics of Heard it All Before, I raced out to buy this CD. Turns out that it was the only good cut on the whole disc. Anderson seems to stretch her talents too thin to cover the other selections on the disc; they are weak. I'm not sure what the other reviewers are listening to, but this ain't it."
5,I Absolutely LOVE this CD.,"I'm disappointed in the negative reviews written regarding this CD. The comments suggesting she get better material....like what? Is my question. Compared to what is available right now I'm happy with the quality of this CD....if ""getting better material"" means getting material like that of J. Lo or some of that other ""supposed to be happenin"" music then I can see why this album isn't to your liking. If you just enjoy great music then get this album...but again if you're into the young sounds like Petey Pablo, J. Lo.....then this album isn't for you."
5,Excellent,"Wonderfully informative, engrossing, overall a worthwhile read. There's a reason all other books on the subject trace back to it."
3,sc johnson paste wax,"shine ok but wax on wax off and not fast or easy to use called manf do not use with food ie butcher blocks etc,,glad i called ,i believe best use is for hardwood floors,with power buffer.better products availible for furniture,the smell is certainly not what id want just before guest comming over either,best if has time to air off,also must be used on sealed surfaces not open or unsealed butcher blocks accordind to manuf..should be a one star for furniture, but the call made me think sellers are not knowing the best applications for the product'"
2,It stinks,This product was recommended as a furniture polish. It's car wax. The odor is very strong and unpleasant. My husband asked me not to use it anymore. It didn't give as much of a shine to my furniture as promised
5,cream style corn? oh yeah,"Thanks to my seller for a good transaction...corn is cut, frozen and being eaten..best corn cutter there is."
5,Water hose for RV,No more coiling a 25' or other length hose and cramming in the storage area of my RV. This one coils by itself and fits in a smaller space.
2,Coiled and Confused,"I bought this coiled hose based on a recommendation from a RV buddy that uses these. Then I received this unit, I was surprised to see how short it looked. Then we went out on our first camping trip, the hose would not stretch enough to reach the faucet and the RV's water inlet. Most campgrounds have all the Hook-ups towards the back of the RV. My RV has the water inlet towards the front, that's what started the problem. I had to use a standard 25' RV hose that reached without any issues and had plenty of length available to move around. I am sure that a 50' coiled hose would have been enough to reach. From what I could see, the coiled hole could barely be extended to half it's rated length. The hose and fittings were of the highest quality though.If you have your water inlet near the rear of the RV, I would recommend this 25' coiled hose. Otherwise I would not or you should save yourself the troubles and try the 50' version instead."
5,Glittery,It's just a book about how to have a little more fun than usual. It will make you laugh if you have a sense of humor about panty liners.
1,are these people crazy?,"This is the absolute stupidest thing i have ever read. The only amazing thing is how this author was ever able to publish it. This book is truly filled with mindless nonsense, for instance where to pass out after a drunken night, tips include the bathtub, in a dirty laundry basket, a hammock and under the dining room table..THANKS CAMERON TUTTLE, insert sarcasm."
3,Ehh...,"I had heard that this book was so wonderful and so hilarious and so great that i spent a really long time trying to find it in the bookstores (I know i could've just bought it from here but i'm old-fashioned!). Well i bought it (may i say it's WAY overpriced!) and read it. All i can say is ""ehh"". Yes it's funny, but it's not a completely witty, trenchant book. Yes it gives good tips, but it leaves out a lot to be desired. I kept feeling like these people were trying to be something they aren't. ""Swell"" isn't very ""swell"". Change the title to ""Decent""."
4,one of the more talanted women in fetish photography,"doris kloster's work are very sexsual, it seem almost a silly thing to say about an erotic photography book, but if you have seen one or tow books that deals with erotic issues, you probebly know that a lot of the times there's a clinical remote feel of unnatural situation that seemed to be more of a show or a posed scene rather then anything that has anything to to with actual people and events.the people in this book seem into it, they are real people and it emidiatly shows, wether she's dealing with cross dressing, dominence, submissiveness, outdoor scenes or mumifacation, they apear to be enjoying themself and taking a lively actual part in her vision.i found this book pretty sexy and interesting, the photos are in very good color and quality of printing is very good compare to other books i have. it's a good intrudaction to kloster's work and have planty of very good shots in it."
2,Waste of time and money,"Before you buy this product, ask yourself...Can I remember the Japanese meaning of ""good morning"" by thinking of the state of Ohio and moss? ""Good morning"" in Japanese is ""ohayou gozaimasu"". That's an example of how this program works. It tells you a lame way of remembering how it's pronounced, but that doesn't relate at all to it's meaning. While I like the idea of using a story to learn a language, I'll give it two starts. But, it's used poorly here. The story is uninteresting, and it's not even woven into the material very well."
2,shortneck folks look somewhere else,If you are short neck individual (say you have broad athletic shoulder and great trapezoid muscle) this shoulder rest wont work for you. Even at its lower position it will be too high.
5,Not even a week yet,"I just got this a few days ago, but I can honestly say I think it is making a difference. I'm excited to see the results in another week or two."
3,derma want,"I really haven't been able to tell much different in the amount of times I have used it, not as regular as recommended"
4,dermawand using for dudes.,"Sorry but we need to moisturize more, stay young on the outside as well.Feels good, skin is firm even tone ...guys manscape & keep up with Wat your girl/ guy found you* that's key"
2,Good for few days,I ordered this item and shipping was very fast. i read the instructions with CD and religiously follow. As it is not battery operated item you have to plug in so there should not be any reason for loosing its power But it happened and also in some parts it hurts.i send the message to customer care But all in vain. nobody contact me may be the reason is I buy from Amazon not from them! Anyway I returned this item and waiting for my refund. I am disappointed because I really need this kind of item.let's hope for the better one.the prize is attractive compare to nu-brilliance but i wish it should work the way they said.
3,Go Ahead and Buy IT,"I am using this wand less than recommended, only once in the AM and on a lower setting than I can be using, but I do see some difference after using it for 2 weeks. My skin has a brighter glow and things seem to be firmer. However, I would not recommend using around the eyes. Within 15-20 minutes after using the wand around my eyes, my vision would go blurry, my eyes would ache immediately and itch several hours later. Using it on the rest of my face seems to be fine. I e-mailed the creator of the wand to ask a few questions and she immediately (the same day) e-mailed me back. I was very surprised!"
2,Derma Wand,Not as good as advertised! I should do more resource next time I'm buying anything! New shoes would be nicer!
3,Still Waiting,"I feel the tingle of the wand on my skin that makes you hope it is doing something, but not results.It has only been a few weeks so hopefully it will soon show a difference."
2,Expensive and short-life consumables,"The printer itself is great and has reasonable price. BUT, the toner cartridges and drum unit run out much more faster than the printer configuration page promises. In my case the drum unit should last for 45.000 printouts, real number was 17.000!!! The price for such component was nearly half of the original price of the printer!!! The service staff explained me the printouts numbers were calculated for 6% printed area/page.My advice: Keep eyes wide open for consumables prices!"
5,TRULY ONE OF MR. C'S BEST WORKS!,"I am so glad that ""By Request/Sing to Me Mr. C"" has finally been released on CD..Perry's smooth baritone voice shines through on some wonderful songs like ""Maria"", ""My Favorite Things"", ""More than Likely"", ""Moon River"" and ""Solo Tu"",...With Mr. Como's recent passing, these songs sound even sweeter and makes one more appreciate the great talent of this man...I hope more releases will follow...It angers me that Perry did not see the total releases of his great music...The selfish music industry had to wait until a marketable time, such as his death, to make a profit...Shame on them...My only slight complaint is that the recording did not seem to be of highest quality...Other than that I am thankful to have this recording on CD...Great 2 CD set that is well worth the cost...Long live Perry!"
5,Finally!!!,This video is awesome. Finally a video that works the abs as well as the lower back. There are tons of abs videos out there but none that combine these two areas. It is great! It gives you all you need to get your abs and lower back strong. Balance is the key. Thanks to this video I look and I feel fabulous. I recomend it to everyone.
5,Great for painting and coloring!,I purchased this for my daughter who is 2 1/2. She loves to paint at school but we just don't have the room for an easel at this point. This was the perfect solution! She can sit at the table with her paint brushes and paint. I haven't had her do finger painting yet but I'm sure we'll get some finger paints at some point soon- maybe when the weather is warmer and she can do it outside at her picnic table. I really like that it holds the paper steady for her- the tray did not move at all while she was painting. As the other reviewer said- also great idea for coloring so crayons or markers don't roll away- I hadn't thought of that but great idea!Definitely recommend this product if you are holding off on an easel purchase!
4,Perry Covering Peggy and the Rat Pack,"As RCA's cleanup hitter of the day, Perry had to cover the hits of his contemporaries on other labels. Fortunately, I don't recall his doing Peggy's tunes other than ""It's a Good Day."" He does several covers of Frank's Capitols here, very well. Perry's weakness in this role is that his emotional range is limited (you can't be noncommital about ""hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate"") in addition to which the Ray Charles Singers springing out of the closet at the climax of that ultimate expression of aloneness ""In the Still of the Night"" is downright grotesque.I've compared the small-group recordings of ""We Get Letters"" to Dean Martin's ""Swingin' Down Yonder"" to Dean's considerable advantage. Perry's great in the grand settings in which his hits, from ""Temptation"" on, were scored. I'd rather direct new listeners there."
3,ASL book,This was not what I needed. I am sure it would be good for some but I have resource too similar so I sent it back. (Have not seen my account credited yet)
5,Great Book,I am very pleased with my book. It is everything I expected and I am able to keep up in my class now thanks to this book. It has sign language and deaf culture as well all in one book. I would definitly recommend this to other class mates.
3,Nice clean frame/Not NISMO,"This frame is sturdy and appears to be of good initial quality. However, unless I'm mistaken the original display showed NISMO screw caps and appeared to say NISMO engraved into it. Not the case. Careful."
5,Stories from around the globe,"This is a great book. My 4 y.o. son loves the stories, and the illustrations. A bonus is that it also comes with a CD, and once he discovered that mommy is chopped liver! So I pop in the CD and he reads along. We really love this book."
1,"BIASED,WRONG FACTS.....A CRAP BOOK!!!!","I have never read a book so misleading and biased before in my life. How could he possibly write a book about China's future and it's history if he himself doesn't know a thing about the country???I particulary dislike hows hes says that China dwells too much on WWII issues like the nannjing massacre......well if 300,000 civilians were killed in cold blood and the country carrying out the act still doesn't admit it till this very day.....wouldn't you feel some hatred??Seems like a very anti-chinese book and only provides a good read if you carry those views...."
1,the new book is like a used one,"I bought a new book, but the book I received is just like a used one, which has been folded badly."
4,"Not the best port, but still a fine game","Pros:-A fun, stoyline.-Charming, likable characters.-One of the coolest battle engines for an rpg.-Character development (ability-wise), one of the best seen on a console.Cons:-Voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard.-Game is a tad easy.-Some slowdown.-A few extra areas or mini games would have helped to break the linearality.Overall:The storyline will keep you engaged and with the exception of Gadwin, you will absolutely fall in love with the characters. The game is fun, has one of the coolest battle and ability upgrading systems seen on a console. Not perfect, but the good definitely outweighs the bad."
4,Grandia has gotta be one of the best RPGs I've played....,"Everything about it is good. The characters, storyline, gameplay, audio, sound FX, all of them are excellent!! The graphics are very good for a Saturn port. If you want to play a non-Square RPG, give this a shot."
4,Grandia is one of the best PSX RPGs,"Grandia is one of my favorite RPGs, and that's saying a lot, as I play a lot of RPGs. It is probably my third favorite, just under Chrono Trigger and Lunar. The graphics are pretty cool, for the PlayStation at least. (They're amazing if you remember that they were made more then three years ago!) The best part about this game is it's characters. Justin, Sue, Feena and the others really help you get into the mood of the game. The game's plot is a little cliched, i.e. Courageous young boy must stop evil man from taking over the world with the help of his girlfriend. But oh well, it's still a really great game. Play it!"
4,Works good!,"My only complaint on this tach is the wire that comes with it. For my purpose it is way to short, other than that, it seems to be accurate and works well. I would like to see it come with longer wire! Would only take it down a half a star for the wire, if the system would let me."
1,no good,If you don't have a Doctorate in mathamatics don't buy this book. It would take a lifetime to finish it.
4,"Very good, but ....","This book is refered by the publishers as the best book on history of mechanics. Indeed, it is a very complete work, showing in cronological order all the developments and contributions made by a great number of scientists and mathematicians, many of them famous but including also many not-so-famous and even not known. The book is very well written. However, when I bought this book I was expecting something more informal, more enjoyable to read. The feeling I have is that the book is somewhat too formal, arid, like the common textbooks. Although, it is still a very fine, very good book, and I suggest that every physics student to read it."
5,Needs a bit of help for 5 stars,The size is right. Aluminum is fine for luthier use. A bit of filing here and there and gluing of some cork protectors puts this clamp at five stars.
4,Very addictive!,Warning! You may not stop playing this game! This is the best game since Max Payne! Its a great easy fun game. The controls are some what hard to get use to but they explain it as the game goes along. Once you get it you'll keep playing and playing for hours to come!
2,very juvenile,this game starts out really cool - the controls are good and the takedowns are wild. this is where you disarm an enemy and blow his head off in one move. but then things start to slide very quickly. the game is punctuated by puzzles which are extremely annoying and not at all fun. the worst of which is the bomb disarming where you run a ball through a maze and if you touch the edges the bomb explodes. this reminds me of a very stupid game that must have been around in the 70s or 80s. why namco would resurrect this ridiculous concept as part of dead to rights is beyond me!!! the action is also soooooo arcade - enemies pour onto screen so you can blow them away with auto-aim. this is fun for about 5 minutes but the game never develops beyond this. it's like time crisis without the piece. if your under 12 this game may be for you but even kids these days are sophisticated gamers so I don't know.
3,Definately a Rental,"Overall the game play is good, but towards the middle it gets repetative. The variety of weapons is a plus and I could play around with the disarms all day. If you like the arcade style shoot-em up then this is the game for you, but if you are a fan of the engrossing storyline you better file this game under your rental section."
3,dead to rights,This is a great game until the point that u find out that the game is very very short. i like how it has the mini games in it. and how u can use your dog. also i like how u have hand on hand fights..i would of like this game alot better if it was longer . so if u r thinkin about buying this game don't buy it go to the store rent it and beat it in like 2 or 3 days
2,"No instructions, has an extra pin.","The adapter has NO instructions and has an extra pin on the IDE cable connector, because you have to cut off the extra pin. Since you have no instructions, you have to guess what is the top or bottom. It's very easy to cut off the wrong pin. That's what I ended up doing, I cut off the wrong pin and never got to use the adapter. The brackets are nice to fit the notebook hard drive into your desktop and work very well. I only paid $4.50 for this I guess the brackets were worth that."
5,lovely,"This is the most wonderful handsoap. The bottle is very pretty and the scent of orange is light and fruity, but not too strong. It makes my hands very soft. Guests always inquire as to where I got it."
3,Mix the vibe,I thought this cd was good. It loses some of its intensity after about 3 tracks but generally was well done.
5,This is the Most exiteing suspenseing book in the world!!,"This is the most thrilling book in the world!Alec,The Black, and Henry are out on an adventure... once again!!Alec is baffled by three colts that arrive for sale from Spain. They look so much like his horse, that Alec is sure they have the same sire.But that wonderful stallion died years ago in Arabia. Or did he?In search of the answer Alec and the Black begin a dangerous journey.In spain they meet the colts' eccentric owner, Angel Gonzalez, who takes them to a remote mountian stronghold of anb Arab sheik. The sheik insists he's seen the Black's sire running free, in the mountains. And he wants Alec and the Black to catch him.Yet Alec is suspicious. He thinks the whole story is nothing more than an elaborite plot to lure him and his horse to this desolate place-but why??You have to have read the first book in the series to know who Tabari is and if you don't then, you wouldn't get the whole book (expeacially the end!)."
4,nice net,"This net seems to be well made. I haven't used it yet, so I can not comment on how well it works."
4,"Good content, spelling errors, omission","I enjoyed reading this book until the point that my grandfather was evacuated from the unit. There were spelling errors that could have been corrected. My grandfather was cited as having received a Bronze Star in the text but he was not in the list of members of the unit who received Bronze Stars. An index would have been useful, but the book is searchable on Google Books, solving the problem of not having an index as far as I could tell."
3,History Good-Grammar/Spelling/ Editing Very Poor,"I would have rated The Mortarmen higher had it been properly edited. It should have never been published without editing. There are countless typographical errors, examples of poor syntax, and the misspelling of common words. The history of this unit, the 87th, is very good. I have yet to read what the Germans say about their contact with the 87th."
3,THIN IS IN,THIS CIRCLE CUTTER WORKS ONLY ON VERY THIN STOCK AND IS VERY HARD TO ADJUST TO A SPECIFIC SIZE AS THE DIAL IS ON THE INSIDE. OTHER THAN THAT IT DOES A GOOD JOB WITH A CLEAN CUT EDGE.
2,Ok,"This circle cutter is very difficult to use. No matter how many times myself or another person used this product, it would never cut a perfect circle. I even brought it to a scrapbook get together with friends and no one could get the thing to cut a perfect circle. It ALWAYS overlapped. Not sure what the problem is with this cutter."
5,A great weekend read!,"I purchased this book to take with me on my vacation. This year was my firstime going on a luxury liner. ""The Love Boat"" is what I kept refering to it as each morning that I tried to get out of bed. Sadly, I was not able to do a lot on board as I kept getting sea sick. Thank God, I had the good sense to take an entertaining book along!""Thief of Hearts"" by Victoria Murray is an engaging story that keep me interested from the very moment I opened the book.It was easy on the old blinkers and surprisingly quick to read. As a matter of fact, I read it twice before returning home from my vacation.I liked the fun characters, and I loved the thrilling suspense. My favorite in this type of book. Action, romance, and excitement is what this book is about!I know you are going to have as much fun reading this story as I did!"
1,Plain Junk,"How disappointing. No depth to characters, unbelievably poor editing, and dialogue a 6 year old would write. Who uses the other person's name in every sentence????I haven't a clue why anyone would enjoy this book."
1,5 stars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why ?,"This is a BAD book.In EVERY respect. In one 15 page section she uses the words squirm, squirmed, and squirming 11 times. During the same 15 pages her lead female character calls someone ""mister funny man"", mister question man"", ""mister smart man"", ""mister fashion man"", ""mister chef man "", ""mister attorney man"", and ""bucko"". Who talks this way ? The book never improves. Finally she just stops writing. There is no conclusion."
5,"""Great Fun !""","I have read 2 of the 4 books in this series so far and I have to tell you, I think it is just great...such fun I'm having. I look forward to the 2 remaining books in The Lambert Series by Victoria Murray."
5,"Thief of Hearts,","Thief of Hearts may not be the best book in the Lambert series by entertaining new writer, Victoria Murray, but the series itself is just fantastic. I had a real fun time connecting the four-book plot. I am happy to recommend all four books to anyone that enjoyes a fun and sexy soap-like read. I had fun and think most readers will agree."
3,Mediocre,"I guess you could say the storyline was ""fun"". I keep seeing the same word ""fun"" to describe this book, and it's true on some level.But to get through the pages, you need to overlook the fact that the author isn't up to the same speed as a number of other romance writers. New author or not, it shouldn't matter. If you're paying for a book, you expect a certain level of effort and talent, and you expect the publisher to deliver that. And discerning readers aren't supposed to make excuses because an author is still ""new"" (I'm quoting other reviewers). Writing shows effort or it does not.So if you find repeated misspellings and grammatical errors acceptable - that's where effort comes in - if things like that don't matter to you, or you don't notice them, and if you think you'll have more fun reading this book than an edited Harlequin at a third of the cost, go ahead and buy it. That's just my personal opinion."
3,ok,this was ok it took a little longer then I thought it should! But my Grandfather liked tohe nuts!
4,Steamy with a Good Story Line,"I was captivated with the entertaining story line, and I especially enjoyed the vivid descriptions of cities in Europe throughout the entire manuscript. It was obvious that Megan was able to describe these areas in Europe so vividly and accurately because of her own experience visiting these places herself. It was refreshing to read a novel with such attention to detail. I couldn't put this book down, and finished it in 2 days. Very steamy and a good read."
1,Very Cheap/Bad Finish,"The tables arrived in a timely manner, but are very cheaply made and the finish uneven and scratched. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item. The stand is pathetically cheap, wobbles, and has been discarded as un-useable. They are not worth it at any price."
3,Not for YOUNG TEENS,"I am the mother of a 13 YO daughter that picked this up at our local library when she was with her girlfriend, and I saw it on our den table later that night. I told her that I had to read it first before she was going to read it.Boy, it opened my eyes to what she could have hidden from me if she chose to; subjects discussed in short stories are abortion (we are Catholic so that's a hot issue with us) abstinence (we parents can only wish our sons and daughters would do that for their own health and peace of mind)sexual control, gender preference confusion and other sexual topics.PARENTS OF TEENS: I would read it first cover to cover (2 hours of your time) and then let your teen read it; talk about the book, what they think about the subjects. It will open up doors for honest, sincere communication from both of you."
4,Works great on Powerbook 12 and Powermac G4,The set-up is very easy. It only took few minutes to pair and the mouse worked right away. It does not come with driver for Mac OS so not all of the buttons are working. This mouse is not supported to worked on Mac OS but its working without any problem. The good thing about this mouse is the rest on the button can be configured under Expose on Panther. Battery life probably about 2months. I used rechargable NiMh battery so I don't have to buy batteries everytime. In Panther this mouse is more responsive compared to Jaguar. So I been using it All the time.
4,Works with Apple - iMac and iBook - right out of the box,"I have the iMac and iBook running OSX Panther and this mouse worked with both right out of the box after going through the simple bluetooth pairing routine on the Mac. This is more a testament to the ease of use of the Apple OS than the mouse, but what matters most is that it works even though the technical specs make no mention of Apple OSX support. Both my computers have bluetooth built in so I didn't have to deal with the external bluetooth thingy that came with the mouse.The only downside is that without Apple OSX drivers some of the buttons don't work. The right and left buttons and the scroll wheel all work fine, but without the OSX drivers the seondary clickers are dead. This is no big deal in my view. And I suspect that OSX drivers will eventually be released."
1,WORTHLESS,"I'd call it a baby's brush...but it is too large for a baby. Worthless...but my own lack of discernment, perhaps."
1,Utter drivel,"As a devout Christian I found this book not only to be utter drivel, but to be an offense to the name of Christ. How someone can get a book published in this day and age stating that schizophrenia is a state of ""split personality"" is beyond me! That a ""man of God"" would do so little research on such an important topic is abominable. Schizophrenia is nothing to do with split personalities, as most people are aware. Tragic."
2,Not,"my cup of tea. I didn't finish reading this book as I felt uncomforable. My husband, on the other hand, enjoyed reading it and laughed many times."
1,Not what it seems.,"The description of this item indicates that it is a genuine Konica-Minolta toner cartridge. However, IT IS NOT. It is a refilled item. At least most of the other vendors selling refills indicate that they are ""compatible"" and not the genuine item."
1,Title is MISLEADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You do not get a Coralife Pure-Flo II Premium TFC Reverse Osmosis Water Purification System AND Accessories 24 GPD TFC replacement Membrane, you only get the memebrane. Shouldn't Purification System AND Accessories replacement membrane mean just that? A system and replacement membrane? It doesn't! You only get the membrane. What a joke!!!! Total scam!!"
4,"Great size, great fit","I LOVE my Lowepro slingshot bag. I've had it for over a year now and I still love it. It holds my gear well (I'm a advanced beginner so I have some but not tons.) It's a good weight and it fits comfortably. I'm female but not petite and I find that this bag fits me well when I carry it. I love the option to just throw it over my shoulder or to use it as a sling.The one drawback I can see is it not having a laptop compartment. I don't carry one with me, but if you do, this is not the bag for you."
2,Designed for a man,"I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first. I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out. Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought. It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build. It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me. So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online. Just a word of warning to the ladies;-)"
4,This is good bag,"I bought this bag to replace my current small Lowepro bag, the new one can hold 2 additional lenses and free space for other accessories on the top section on the travel.[...]"
4,Nice Bag,This sling bag is perfect for my Nikon Camera. It gives me enough space that I can put my Sony handy cam in it as well.
4,Adds Welcomed Depth,"Once again an evil plot threatens the magical world, and once again Artemis Fowl is being blamed. Only this time - he's innocent. Will this business keep Artemis from the time critical rescue of his father? Can the magical world be saved?The Arctic Incident adds a welcomed level of depth to the people, fairies, dwarfs, etc . . . that we met in the first book. Bathroom humor, swearing in fairy, and severe injuries are at much the same level in this book as the first, but this one also contains non-graphic killing. Overall an enjoyable read and a step up from the first book in the series."
5,Another Great Read,"While I may have enjoyed the plot a little more in the first chapter of this series, this was still a great book. Colfer writes with great detail and always has a sense of humor about everything. I liked how most of the chapters bounced back and forth from one place to another, real time writing if you will. It was such a great, fast read, just like the original. I couldn't put it down, it took me 3 nights to finish it. We still see Artemis' great mind at work here, but with a little more compassion this time as he seems to use his evil ways to help the good. He is an enigma, an anti-hero who isn't really even all that evil. I can't wait to pick up the next one!"
3,Some unsettling terminology,"I'm reading this book for Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic, and have to say I'm troubled by some of Colfer's terminology. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), ""The Identity Church movement, a diabolical mixture of racism, anti-Semitism, and religion, teaches that Anglo-Saxons are the Jews described in the Bible, that Jews are the descendants of Satan, and that Blacks and other minorities are inferior 'mud people'."" Colfer uses ""mud people"" and variations on it as the standard reference to surface dwellers throughout the book. I know the author is Irish, not American, and may not be aware of the use (or mis-use) of the term, but his American publisher certainly should be.If Scholastic Books can change the title of ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Sorcerer's Stone"" for distribution in the USA, then Hyperion should be able to edit the Artemis Fowl series to get rid of this objectionable, and unfortunately American-based, slur."
5,"Almost unbearably exciting, extraordinary imagination","The first ""Fowl"" was a great book, peopled with well-drawn characters and a great imaginary world. The second book is an extraordinary advance on the first, with unputdownable sequences of rescue and danger and a much more complex plot. Eoin Colfer has an amazing imagination. The audio book is dazzlingly read by Adrian Dunbar and brings the text to life wonderfully."
5,Fowl is Back!!,"Both of the ""Artemis Fowl"" Books are WONDERFUL!!!!!! They are suspenseful, funny, sarchastic, and downright odd, among other things. Just the thought of the first one being as it was surprised me, now this?! Come on, a pre-teen multi-millionare super-genius crime-boy dealing with FARIES trying to rescue his supposedly DEAD dad froom the Russian mophia. Doesn't that strike you as a bit odd? At the same time, a fairy is trying to take over the world. There's a centuar, a 7-foot tall butler, faries, humans, trolls, and a whole bunch of other things!! I have honestly read both of them each at least 11 times each! They're GREAT!!! You should read them. You really should. Hope this helped! By the way, I'm an 11-year old boy , but anyone will love these books."
5,Artemis in the Arctic!,"Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident is actually a GOOD sequel! The intelligence of the child prodigy is endless, as usual. However, in this book, readers can see a softer side of Artemis. He searches for his father, convinced that he is still alive. Our familiar characters return, and new friends (and enemies) are introduced.A great read for all..."
2,mmmmmh - another disappointing sequel,"I liked Colfer's first book, although it did include a lot of themes that I felt were a bit difficult for children to handle and many other reviewers have debated that point as well. Having said that, both kids that read the book loved them and were eagerly awaiting the sequel. The squel definitely was not as well written as the first (but that's an adult point of view and my friend's kids didn't really think so....), and Colfer must have read some of his reviews, because he did seem to put more effort into include more positive themes for the kids, which is good. Kids loved it, so what can I say?"
1,A DISAPOINTMENT!,I read the first artemis fowl and it was great i couldn't find anything wrong with it. I couldn't put the book down as for this one its just a horrible sequal. I meen artemis and the fairies put all that behind them to save his father i just dont think it works that way there should be a book between the two. So it can explain in more detail why they actually decide to team up and also involving the mafia in an artemis fowl story? its just not right. I recomend the first but not the second
3,Artemis the Criminal Hero,This was probably my favorite of the Artemis books. I loved learning so much more about each of the characters. It was fun to read Artemis as the criminal hero rather than just the criminal.
1,"leaves stains, ironically enough","These sheets are VERY wet, and the great irony is that they leave stains themselves after you've used them to clean a different stain. They do not dry clear... they leave their own off-color stain. I used a few of them and then abandoned this product. The Tide-to-Go sticks work much, much better."
3,DOVETAIL JIG D2796,"HARBOR FREIGHT HAS THIS SAME TOOL BUT AT 32 BUCKS!!! HAVE NOT HAD GOOD LUCK SO FAR, JOINTS DON'T SEEM TO FIT PEOPERTLY. HAVE TO MAKE MORE ADJUSTMENTS I THINK. PRODUCT IS SOLID AND WORTH THE MONEY, LOOKED AT HARBOR FREIGHT'S COPY AND IT SEEMS TO BE MISSING PARTS. SOME ADVISE: PLEASE INDICATE THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE A GUIDE TEMPLATE AND GUIDE BUSHING FOR THIS PRODUCT TO WORK PROPERTLY, THANKS"
4,Impressive,"Hearing Metheney's tunes in a different context, apart from his guitar and Mayes' ubiquitous synth, really helps you to appreciate what strong, memorable themes Metheny writes. And Curnow's arrangments are first rate; he knows just what voice to assign where. The result is classic big band sound with some of the hippest tunes ever arranged for that settings. Listening to this makes me wish I was still in my high school big band, so that I might get a chance to play some of Curnow's charts!"
2,Lacks Heart - Dead and Lifeless,"This music in its original form is vibrant and alive. Metheny and Mays write exquisite music, which lends itself well to a big band interpretation and treatment. This is not the one. It sounds like they are just reading the charts and going through the motions, with no feeling for the music at all. There is little or no passion in the interpretation. Metheny's 5 piece band sounds bigger than this ensemble. I was really looking forward to this. What a disappointment."
2,Heavy,"This alarm is heavy, which makes it cumbersome to use in a purse. We tried to use it on the door of a hotel room, but the gap between the frame and the door was too wide for the sensor and the alarm sounded even though the door was closed. I can say that the alarm is loud. The only ways to turn off the alarm are to either remove the batteries, which takes a screw driver, or to connect the sensor cord. Because the alarm seems so sensitive, I was uncomfortable leaving the batteries and sensor cord in place when going through airport security. It's cumbersome to use and travel with."
4,Nice Inexpensive Faux Opal Earrings,These earrings look exactly as shown in the picture. I have worn mine several times and they have shown no signs of tarnish. Hopefully they are actually 24k gold and will remain bright and shiny. The stones are a lovely iridescent blue/green/white color. So far I like them a lot and am glad I purchased them. Great price for these earrings!
5,LOVE,"I love these.. right price love opals.. Arrived on time or if not sooner... Have not lost them yet, bad habit of loosing ear rings.."
1,A dud,"With all respect due to perhaps the greatest pistoleer the world has ever known, McGivern's book is long on promises and short on tutelage. Somewhere between the author's hyperbole and self-aggrandizing speech, I looked for a tidbit or two of useful, instructional information but found none. In short, McGivern comes across as a blowhard, one who has nothing to offer the reader in terms of advice on shooting. Skip this book---your time would be better spent on the shooting range."
4,Ed McGivern is the boss,"Pros: Man, that guy knows how to shoot. Very interesting.Cons: Mostly trick shooting, which takes tons of practice. I was looking for something to help with regular situations, but quickly. It applies, but not as well as I'd hoped. Also, the language is getting dated and it's a little wordy.Overall: I'm glad I bought it."
2,Too Many Misspelled Words,My husband and I found this crossword book too difficult for two reasons: some of the word answers were not spelled correctly and some of the answers were not found in a dictionary or on the Internet. One other problem with the book is that the key in the back of the book was so little and hard to read that we had to use a magnifying glass.
3,Bible Puzzle,"To be much more fun, as well as instructive, the puzzle cound be less difficult. My only complaint is that they are too hard."
4,haza!!,great game but ai is not the best but it's old.plus you know its a good game if they made 5 more like it.
5,The missing piece,"This book helped me to ""remember who I am"". What a wonderful resource to help me to gain back my self-esteem."
4,Great Book,"This is a really good book on business etiquette, and etiquette in general, although I have not read many other books in the genre as a comparison. Gives very specific, easy to find and easy to read information on any particular etiquette topic you're searching for, and gives it to you in short paragraphs and chapters. The section on proper use and placement of table utensils is a bit to digest if you've never paid attention before. Overall, great stuff."
3,It's not a bad album but...,"First off this album is way way way to expensive, 70 bucks is way to much, anyways, Kane Roberts is one of the most underatted Guitarists to ever hit the world, he's so good at what he does, and his confidence is amazing, and on this cd it has some good examples of that like, Rock Doll, Tears of Fire, and Outlaw, but those are the only ones that stand out, this album is basically corporate hair metal, its good corporate hair metal, but still corporate hair metal. If it was re - released and brand new for about 13 bucks i'd buy it, but used for 70 bucks is crap for what you get."
4,Great Read BUT ....,"This was another great book by Tina St. John. I loved Sebastian from the White Lion book and wanted so much to see him find the love of his life, which he does, only I don't think I would have been so forgiving.I had a major problem with Zahirah, the female assassin and Sebastian's love. There were just too many things she did that I personally could not and would not be able to overlook - but perhaps that is just 'my problem'. Otherwise, this is an exciting story, very fast read with no dull moments in between.The sex was hot and luscious. I loved seeing the references and contact with 'Blackheart' who is the hero from Lord of Vengeance. Really a super well-written story that I have come to expect from St. John now that I have read all her books. I look forward to her next offerings."
5,Tina St John just keeps getting better and better!,"Wow, this book sizzles! In BLACK LION'S BRIDE, the sequel to WHITE LION'S LADY, Tina St. John turns up the heat. Sebastian and Zahirah's story will keep you turning the pages with thrilling adventure and a hot and sexy romance. This book is not to be missed!"
3,"Enjoyable, until the author cops-out.","I did enjoy this book but I had to give it 3 stars because I was totally disappointed and felt the author really copped out when 1/2 way through the book it's revealed ------ Don't read further if you don't want to know -- our heroine, Zahirah is not really Arab at all, but English! Not even 1/2 Arab. Not even a speck of Arab. In fact Sebastian doesn't even really declare his love to Zahirah until he suspects it...although I think it's clear he would have loved her regardless. I don't know why the author felt it necessary to do this. But it sort of wrecks the main premise and conflict of the book, that Sebastian and Zahirah can't help themselves and love each other despite their vast ethnic, religious, and cultural differences. The result: it just doesn't deliver the same punch (even though Zahirah doesn't know this about herself until near the end)."
5,Great Historical Romance,Great story line with believable characters you will like. Story is set in Palestine during the 3rd Crusade late ll00's with plenty of action and rescues. Your heart will pound and the story will stay with you afterwards. Loved it! Highly recommend it to you.
1,ugh.... hated it....and I'm a widow!,"I didn't like it. I more than didn't like it. I found this book to be ridiculous and inane. Maybe as a fairly recent widow, I just dislike reading about other people's view on the subject, even if they are completely fictionalized. I'll give it another go in a few months, but, in my current opinion, I was totally disappointed with this book. Please don't automatically suggest to a widow/widower that he or she read this book just because of the subject matter."
5,Grief and the eventual good that follows,"Being eight months into a loss myself, this book rang incredibly true. I cried a lot but at the same time found great comfort in recognizing so many aspects of this difficult journey while also loving the storyline and Sophie's development. The characters are all so alive and believable and when the book ended, I actually couldn't believe that I wouldn't get to know what happened next with all of these people."
1,Watch Eubanks bow at the golfers feet...what a bore,"John Feinstein golf books are good because they are extremely detailed. They are not that exciting or insightful and the writing drones on, but the inside information is there. Steve Eubanks attempts this and fails miserably. Covers too many topics that have already been looked at in-depth many times. Looks at all the players covered as saints. Uses too many boring quotes. The writing is bland. If that isn't enough, he refers to Van de Velde & Sandelin as strikingly handsome. Come on, no one cares."
5,ONE POINT EVERYBODY IS MISSING,"Something you should know about this book: It's about sex, and it's about glamour. Now think about that. In the forties there was lots of glamour, and since the sixties there has been lots of sex. But you have to go back seventy years to find that combination alive, well, unfettered and at its glorious best in Hollywood film. If you want to know why American film is just a little sick today, and was just a little sick during the years of censorship, you have to go back to the good old OLD days, when things were healthy for like, oh, fifteen minutes.That's what's wonderful about this book. It takes you back to when things were right, and shows how things went wrong. Everything else is just extra, and the extras are pretty fine, too."
4,Twisted Metal Review,I think the game was lots of fun. I espically like the vechicle that shoot missles and ice beams.From Twisted Metal III to IIII the changes are awesome. The option of making vechicles is espically nice with the new attacks they are capable of.Enjoy Twisted Metal IIII!
2,Do Not Buy,"I purchased this game not too long ago thinking that it would be like the first two Twisted Metals. However, it is nothing like them. In this version there is no storyline to be found. It is also near impossible to kill your opponent since both of your are trying to attack each other at high speeds. Playing this game seems like some blurry vision with a lot of explosions. It can also be too complicated at times. For being such a recently developed game, the graphics did not live up to my expectations.The reason I decided to give this game two stars was because of the game music: Rob Zombie, Cirrus, Cypress Hill, Skold, Ghoulspoon, and One Minute Silence.In conclusion, save yourself the money and stick with the first two Twisted Metals. I would recommend buying Twisted Metal 2: World Tour."
2,whatever,"Some good levels, some good cars. Mostly nothing special, though. If you want a good Twisted Metal game, look elsewhere in teh series. If you want a good vehicular destruction game, look to Vigilante 8 or, better still Interstate 76 or Interstate 82."
2,what happened to my beloved TM series?,"Wow! thats all i can say. This game should not have the twisted metal name on it. Im not saying that its a totally bad game, its just not a good twisted metal game. There are some features that are its saving grace, like creating your own car, but theres not much depth to it. I liked the ability to play as calypso, but what the hell did they do to sweet tooth! Its just a pathetic attempt to put a fresh new spin on a series staple. I cant recommend this game to anyone but the true TM hardcore fans. I must admit i own this game just for the sole fact that it has the TM name. P.S. i cant wait for TM for PS3."
5,good good good,i really liked one n two n 3 was not that bad but 4 is supposed 2 b the best i want this bcuz i cant spend over 45 more bucks very good
1,The closest thing to Woodstock.,"We at the Ligonus International Media Corporation like to have a good time too! We feel that this is a great example of good times, good music, and good fun! The list of bands present at the concert is amazing! A must see for any music lover."
5,a great introduction,"an outstanding trip through the formation of the 80's underground with sections that are long enough to give you a taste of the major bands, and short enough to avoid bogging you down with excess. Every band mentioned is phenominal and most are fairly different from one another, which helps to cover the variety of music that still lays under the radar, in the ever expanding relm of indipendant music. These bands are great starting points further exploration."
4,an interesting life,"I read this book a long time ago and picked it up again this past week to read the Sonic Youth chapter. Azerrad is a fantastic writer and reporter and his depiction of the world in which the grandparents of indie rock lived and toiled is really fascinating at times. I like his mix of enthusiasm and fly on the wall presentation. I would rec. this book to anyone interested in the roots of indie rock: the bands, the labels, the scenes. . ."
2,Rose colored histories,"So much of this book is tripe. What you get is a cut/ paste of old interviews alongside higly romantisized band biographies. Everyone talks so highly of Azerrad's writing, but that's just make-up covering a lack of substance.Its not really a bad book, I just think its a rather pointless book. Like I said, most of these interviews have been around for a decade or more, and I don't really need to hear some fan-boy gush over his man crushes with seminal 80's rock icons.'Cides, if you're into the bands, then you probably know most of this stuff already."
2,stupid waste of money,"the book isn't that good; get the Doctor's Book of Home remedies Instead. The information is vague, and the index is set up for herbs instead of ailments. Isn't the book supposed to tell you which herbs fix which ailments? not easy to look things up."
2,Not all it is crackup to be,I heard Gary Null speak about this book. I expected to find new answers to solve my health problems. Unfortunately I already knew all that was listed for my health problems. I could have learned more with an hour on the internet.
3,Interesting,This is an interesting read for those of us who feel that natural healing is preferred in many cases.I understand many of the suggestions were used by many earlier generations.
2,Gross Inaccuracies Found,"The first section of this book which I read was the chapter on diabetes. I found Dr. Null's description of current treatments and prescribed diets to be completely contradictary to the information and instructions I have received from my Doctors, dieticians, and diabetes educators, all of whom work for an HMO. Is Dr. Null being intentionally misleading or is he just severely behind the times. In either case, one must wonder how extensively do such inaccuracies pervade this book."
2,Disapointing franchise of UK series,"If, like me, you like the original BBC Top Gear with Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May, you might be tempted by the US version of the show.All I can say is, give it a try. You might like it.As for me, I found it very dissapointing.I could write a book on the ways the US franchise of Top Gear falls short of the Brits version (and I AM an american)or even the aussie version, but I wont. Even assuming that the US version is a 'stand alone' show that is attempting to be deliberately different and unique, it still fails. Instead of listing the nurmerous flaws and shortcomings or giving PROS and CONS, I'll try to sum the US Top Gear up in one sentence:Its The Three Stooges trying to do a semi-serious car show."
4,Dark sector,I have heard from a couple of people that they didnt care for this game because they had a hard time controlling the charictor. I personally dont have to much trouble and I am not a professional gamer or anything... I think that this game is pretty awsome especially when you consider the price. Also a pretty cool story and so far this game keeps me thinking and I love the gore...
4,A Must Buy!!!,"Really cool game, very creative. Not only do you get guns in this game (which are given made up names)you also get what is called a Glaive. An emplement that is perfect for Decaps and cutting off appendages. Lots of replay value due to the many creative ways to kill your enemy with the Glaive. A must buy!!!"
4,"Despite a few hitches, it's a great game.","The story line is nothing spectacular, however gameplay is very fun. The game borrowed many ideas from other games such as the black market where you purchase weapons being very reminiscent of the merchant from Resident Evil 4. The six-axis controls on the glaive felt a lot like shooting arrows as Kai from Heavenly sword. That being said, it didn't stop the game from being fun. I just like for developers to be creative. They could have used a little more variety with the finishing close up kills. The glaive (the knife boomerang that Hayden uses) adds a nice touch to the game. Slicing the creatures and various enemies in half was quite fun. The ability to absorb electricity and fire helped to keep the glaive from getting too repetitive. Boss battles were fun and some were pretty hard. Overall the game was really good."
1,it cannot be installed,"This is a piece of junk. After spent two hours, the windows got frozen many times. I finally give up. Do not waste your time and money!"
4,On the other hand...,"I do not disagree with other posted reviews. However, I thought I might point out who this book is actually intended for: the uninitiated.If you have no background in critical thinking or basic philosophical discourse, by all means, pick up this book and give it a read. You will find it immensely helpful.If you have taken a few courses in philosophy with professors of an analytic bent or find yourself in similar circumstance however, this book will probably do you no good.The book covers quite a bit of ground and is a very easy read. But anyone with more than cursory knowledge of argumentation will see this book as a overly extended version of a review."
2,pretty forgettable,I gave this one plenty of chances but it never made me want to listen to it. Colma (only other Buckethead CD I have) was hit or miss for me but at least those hits existed!
2,Take that damn bucket off!,"Like the costume, his guitar sound never changes. Soooooooooooooooo predictable."
4,"Well, uhm...","Let's be honest. Bounce will not (unlike shows like Sunday and Sweeney) change anyone's life. When that is said, one must also say that any Sondheim is better than no Sondheim.When you've been through the essential Sondheim, even the less essential Sondheim, it is time to buy the cast recording of Bounce along with Saturday Night and The Frogs.Sooner or later you must buy it, though."
4,Review for Gran Turismo experts,"While Gran Turismo 2 (GT2) is an admirable game. It falls short of it's predecessor in many areas. Among the Gran Turismo experts, it is seen as inferior to the original Gran Turismo. The menu system is very cumbersome, there are a few bugs, and the gameplay is not as seamless as in the original. In a nutshell, GT2 was released before it was completely finished. If you own and love the original Gran Turismo, then by Gran Turismo 2, you will enjoy it. If you don't own the original Gran Turismo, they buy it. It is still the best driving/racing game available for the Playstation."
5,this game is awesome and the best ever,This game is the best for me if you play it you are going to like it I tell you this game is exited I only play it once and I like it my father has it but he is in honduras and I live here in the united states and I don't have it bye god bles you.
2,don't buy it unless sony fixes it,there are too many bugs in this game and sony needs to fix it. you can lose your whole garage in this game. you can't finish the game cause they rushed to get it out before christmas and they left off drag racing. they can't spell. the races aren't restrictive enough. the game is good but we shouldn't have to deal with all the bugs since we payed forty dollars of our hard earned money for it. if you bought this game then you should return it and get your money back.
5,Top of the wall!!!!!!!!!!!! a must buy for all GT fans!,"This game is better and the cars are badder than ever! More tracks to race, new cars to drive, and better chances to make SOME HARD CASH!! As you upgrade your car it becomes faster and better that what the shop sold you, and there is also a chance of having race paint on your car. In GT you beat even the world champions, got the best cars, ruled the tracks, and made more than a million. Well it's time to challenge more cars, conquer more tracks, and new champs to beat! If you don't buy this game, you're missing out on some racing of a life time, Well what are you waiting for? Bump all cars in your chance of victory money! This is a racing madness. It's catching hold of you. Buy this game and rule the tracks!"
4,Anthony's Nazareth Review,The only reason I gave this dvd 4 stars is because it is too short! Otherwise a very good show! Nazareth is a very good band if you have never seen them live this is your chance to see all the original members put on a good show.
4,rion 6x8 greenhouse,"beautiful small greenhouse, but a bit difficult to assemble. some parts missing but were supplied in short time. thanks for a good greenhouse."
1,Save your money!!,"Poorly written. Goes around in circles; no obvious beginning, ending, or guiding points along the way."
4,The story of a snowy owl,"This book is a fictionalized story meant for children dealing with the the lifecycle of a snowy owl, from its birth to the time that it finds a mate. I found this book to be well written and the story engaging; I think it is an excellent book for getting children interested in owls, birds, and even Nature in general. The illustrations are very good, but as the book is somewhat older, they are not in colour as now often the case. Overall, a very good book, one that I no reservations in recommending."
5,Wife loves it...!!!,"My wife is L'Amour with this product. It has solved problems like no other laundry product, and it seems to do it by magic."
2,Pink Towels,My husband believed the hype and issisted that he could toss his swim bag in with the towels. The bag had been washed before but still turned the towels pink in spite of the Color Catcher in with the load. I wouldn't count on this unless you have a piece of clothing that has both white and a color that bleeds.
2,Recommendation: Try the competition,"As one reviewer has already stated,""Color Catchers are not magical."" Strongly dyed items should be sent through one or more washes alone using Color Catchers to test for excessive bleeding. Color Catchers do not suck color out of fabric, they merely collect it a little more effectively than many fabrics washed in mixed color loads. Using Color Catchers can help minimize transfer of color and help keep whites whiter. That being said, my experience indicates that there are OTHER BRANDS of dye grabbers on the market that are MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE."
1,DO NOT USE!,"I have a Whirlpool front loading washing machine that has worked like a charm UNTIL I started using these sheets. They clogged the drain filter in my washer and stopped it from working completely. I will NEVER use these again and will def. tell my friends about my experience. Not worth ruining my washer--- I'll wash things that I think will ""bleed"" onto other clothes separately."
1,Did not do it's job,Didn't work at all.Ruined one of my martial arts uniform.I have a horrible stain from my clothing.I didn't even use newly watched clothing.... I used clothing that I had owned for quite some time.This is a sham. Doesn't count if you still have to watch like colors together.
3,Good effort...,"...but ultimately it's nothing more than a rehashed version of the original. This sequel is way too similar to the original novel to merit much attention. Not to be misunderstood because I feel that Jack Ketchum is a gifted storyteller and as was the case with Off Season, he writes an intelligent, cogent and fast paced novel that never fails to either excite and/or repulse. However, when all is said and done, the reader is left with a feeling of deja vu. The story is completely devoid of any element of surprise or originality. If you enjoyed Off Season, you may want to check out Off Spring because it remains a good idea and the story is, again, expertly written but just be cognizant of the fact that you're treading down a very familiar road."
4,Offspring,Not as good as the first one mainly because you knew what to expect but thrilling nevertheless. After the horror of the first didn't add anything new.
4,A good afternoon read,"This is Greene's first such ""entertainment"". I read this work only after having read much of Greene's other work. Unlike many of his pieces (""The Power and the Glory"", ""The End of the Affair"", 'The Heart of the Matter""), this particular work does not focus particularly upon the moral nature of the actions. If you come to this expecting something of the depth of one of the aforementioned pieces, you shall likely emerge disappointed.On the other hand, this is an intensely suspenseful, quick, and pleasant read. The story lends itself perfectly to a rainy afternoon: set upon the Orient Express, this is the no-frills (as is typical of Greene's style) telling of the interactions between Myatt, the Jewish businessman, Coral Musker, the incredibly naive chorus girl, and the Doctor, an exiled revolutionary. While lacking the moral resonance of Greene's later work, this is still a fun and deserving piece."
1,Useless Product - Would prefer to give no stars,"After reading all the positive reviews on this product, I could not wait to savor the vision of ants swarming the bait.The only thing this product did was waste my time.When I checked the bait the next morning, there was just dirt in the bait. My Lousiana black and red ants were just moseying by, totally ignoring what I thought was their doom.Maybe our ants are genetically superior to those that this product was effective for."
1,useless,"The only way this stuff works is if you drown them in it. I've been using this stuff for weeks at a spot on my kitchen counter where I initially saw a few ants. I put Terro liquid on a piece of card stock and they almost immediately chowed down. The next morning the card was swarming with ants. That evening I had to resupply the little buggers with Terro since they'd cleaned their plate.This process has continued for over two weeks and the ants just keep coming and their numbers seem to be getting worse.I'm so done with Terro. Either that stuff is a total ruse or I've got some kind of new genetically modified ant.Don't waste your time with this stuff. I'm going out later today to get good old-fashioned Raid. It ""kills bugs dead."""
2,"1 month and they still keep coming,,,,","I can't tell but it does not seem to kill them.,...they swarm to eat it but they keep coming back !!"
1,My ants are thriving on this stuff!,"This Spring I got an invasion of small black ants in my pantry. Bought two bottles of this Terro liquid and put out 10 paper pads. That was over 3 months ago and the number of ants has not declined at all. Finished one entire bottle. They love this stuff. Put a pad down and they cover it immediately. They seem to be thriving on this product! And, I've got photos to prove it!"
5,Best Ant Solution,"The liquid form is ridiculously easy to use. Simply place a few drops on the included cardboard, or aluminum foil once you've exhausted the cardboard. The ants swarm around, which can be disconcerting, but within a few days they're all gone. Do yourself a favor and pick up the 2-Ounce, and you'll never have to worry again!"
5,Subconscious Jealousy,"It's interesting how all people writing reviews of this book degrade A&M and the principles Aggies stand for. A&M is simply a university built on strong bonds and tradition. A&M has more internationally known tradition than any school in the country. Also, people who demean A&M are obviously shallow and weak individuals attempting to humiliate a seemingly easy prey. I can confidently say that those of us lucky enough to have attended this great university couldn't care less about the derogatory comments by those who are most likely working for more than one Aggie. Therefore, enjoy your pitiful life as a disillusioned inferior."
5,"This is a top, post-bob title for lovers of jazz and funk","This is a top CD by a very hard playing and hard gigging band. I saw this four piece steal the show at the Brecon Jazz Festival, Wales in Great Britain. The CD begins with a spooky number than moves on to funky jazz reminiscent of John Schofield. There is a great deal to enjoy for the curious listener who has not heard much jazz as well as plenty to the pure jazz lover. The upfront sax and lyrical piano blends superbly with the funk and rock drums and the melodic double bass. Check it out !"
5,This album rules!!,This album is probably the best example of Christian hardcore punk I have ever heard. It's just too bad they aren't still together to make anymore.
1,Anti-USA copyright,"_The Leopard_ is a wonderful book. I own the print version of the book and the blue-ray version of Visconti's movie. However the ebook version, the copyright of which belongs to Random House UK, is not available for purchase in the USA. You can buy it (from Amazon, for example) if you live anywhere else in the world."
1,"There was no choice for ""zero stars""","Who knew garbage could be recycled and compressed into a CD? Between the pea-brained lyrics, and mind-numbing guitar riffs (see repititious disaster ""I like the Lights"") they also manage to throw in some profanity. ""Lift"" up the trash can lid, ""Pull"" it from the CD player, and deposit. I had to listen to it while a passenger in a car ride, and once was enough."
4,alright lil mo,"not a bad cd, for those who want something new, peep this but i wonder was lil mo drinking gin and juice when she remade that classic."
1,Macrovision or Other,This CD is encoded with Macrovision or Other. Don't buy it. Get the record labels to produce ERROR FREE recordings.
3,3.5 stars,"Lil' Mo has a beautiful, strong voice, but this album really doesn't do her justice. Her vocals on here are fine and the writing is good, but the production, especially near the end, sort of ruins it. In songs like ""She Cood Neva B Me,"" it gets very cheesy, basic and karaoke-like. (And it doesn't help that I've heard umpteen different versions of ""Time After Time,"" a song that I didn't care all too much for in the first place.) Some songs stand out. By no means is Based On A True Story terrible, it is more like average, but I would recommend her second album above this one."
5,Every Junie B Fan needs this book!,"Great book for encouraging the younger crowd to keep a journal. In true Junie B style, ""Junie B"" writes on one page, another is set aside for your writer to put down her thoughts...like favorite food, friends, embarassing moments,things that make you sad, pages to draw pics of family and friends,....it will make your Junie B fan THINK. Reading Junie B's input is like reading another Junie B book. My almost-7-year-old will need help with spelling but the thoughts are going to be her own, encouraged by Junie B. This is a first journal to complete with your special girl and put away and bring out again and laugh with her when she is in jr high and tuck into her memory box when she leaves home to someday share with her little girl."
5,A masterpiece of poetic literature,"Aime Cesaire, from the Carribean island of Martinique, has written an incredibly powerful poem that focuses on the sufferings of Black people under colonialism. The poem, surrealist in nature at times, features rich language and detailed poetic pictures of the inequalities, hard labor, and abuse that the Black people endured under the oppression of colonialist rule. But Cesaire also infuses the poem, in its final passages, with hope for a brighter day in the struggle against racism where the race will be ""standing and free."" Cesaire was co-creator (with Leopold Senghor) of the concept of Negritude, a literary and cultural movement that emphasized pride in African heritage and culture. His poem is one of the finest examples of 20th century poetry and it demands close reading to unveil its many sparkling diamonds. It is a literary minefield that will enrich all who attend to its beauty and truth."
1,Spend your money on a better set.,There are some true running bits in this set but too many of them wobble way too much. I'm talking about the first time being used too. the initial spin makes a wobble so big that you can't hold the object being drilled. you need to loosely hold the item so it wobbles with the bit to get a hole close to the bit size. Cheap but not worth the expense of my projects. i'll look for a better set.
1,Unusable bits wobble,"Very disappointed in these bits. I bought them on recommendation from Wood Magazine. Most of them are not true and wobble. I thought it was my drill chuck at first but they wobble in all of my drills. Do not waste your money here, you will not be able to drill a precision hole with them."
4,Time Out Naples...T.O. Does It Once Again,"Naples is the latest addition to my Time Out guides. Including New York, Paris, Frankfurt, Bombay and Madrid, I've found all of Time Out's publications to be highly dependable for what's happening.Not only does the Naples guide provide highlights of Naples area history, its recommendations for the must-see eateries and sights are spot on. My recent trip took me to the area for 7 days for a wedding, but using this guide let me make the most of every free moment I had.Only thing that is ever short-changed(as is the case with many guides) are the little out of the way places that one simple stumbles upon, are incredibly cool and actually make the tourist feel like they've stepped out of the controlled Disney-theme presentation of many cities by many guides.This being said, I find that Time Out is always a reliable source for a well rounded experience, particularly if one wants to get a feel for what the local life is like."
1,Terrible game,"I dont know why but right now all college basketball games are really bad. First i bought March Madness 2000, the graphics were horrible. Then I bought this, wayyyy to easy. My 5 year old sister won against Maryland with one of the worst teams, Yale! I am a mega huge college bball fan, a fan of Michagan state and North Carolina. I hope 2001 college basketball games are good. I dont wanna throw out $100 again. This game deserves 0 stars."
1,Other Recommedations,"Other Recommendations Instead of:`Healing Back Pain Naturally' by Art Brownstein MD(he went through many years of back pain, including surgery. I liked the positive approach of the book and the variety of options from medical to herbal, etc)`The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief' by Clair Davies`The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook' by Martha Davis PhD, etc etc(I esp liked the chapter on Meditation, since they were easy and had a variety of ones to choose from to try out)`Living Better Every Patient's Guide to Living with Illness' by Carol J. Langenfeld and Douglas E. Langenfeld`Staying Well With Guided Imagery' by Belleruth Naparstek`Validate Your Pain! Exposing the Chronic Pain Cover-Up' by Allan Chino, PhD and Corinne Dile Davis MD"
5,ONE OF THE BEST RECENT DISCOVERIES IN JAZZ,"Mark Murphy couldn't be wrong: Daria has a sublime voice and an extraordinary vocal agility! So sad that this CD has only 5 tracks! It's really a ""beginning"", but what a start! Let's hope she will offer us many other CDs, as brilliant as this one! I loved especially the last track, a beautiful pyrotechnical moment! Yes, Daria is a singer extraordinaire! Get this CD and be convinced!"
5,Ten Bulls!!!!,"Very Good CD. Strong writing/singing backed by a dream band: Frisell, Horvitz, Rhodes, Shrieve. Potent!"
5,Really Good,"I bought this CD for Rumor Has It and ended up likeing the whole thing!! If you like music like Eve6, Cowboy Mouth and Matchbox20 then you will love this cd!"
1,"speculation, NOT scholarship","I have read almost all of the Rennes le Chateau genre books, and this is by far the worst. There is absolutely no backup for this author's claims, and he smears the rest of the research with his shoddy work. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Okay...but not the quality expected...,"The Key chain fell a part--the tear drop is held to the key chain by a small screw, which came loose. I glued back together with Super Glue...hope it holds.."
1,piece of junk,"I used it once and threw it in the trash. Filmsy & extremely messy. It could never be worth this hassle, no matter how much an improvement in the taste of coffee..."
3,Not quite what I hoped,"After reading other reviews of the series with eager anticipation, actually viewing A History of Britain was disappointing. Simon Schama is obviously knowledgeable and put a lot of work into this presentation; I did gain value from watching it. However, I found the tone of the presentation salacious (akin to British gossip rags), tedious at points, unecessarily gory (do we really need to know that a nefarious nobleman reportedly died from a hot poker up his bum?), a bit choppy in the editing and somewhat hard to follow chronologically. More frequent use of maps would have been helpful for those who live outside England and are thus not familiar with British geography. The best produced and most coherent part was the segment on Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitane. This production stirred me emotionally more than I expected, and not necessarily in a good way."
2,make that woman stop singing!,"Although I am a history buff and I find English history fascinating in general, I have to say that the music used in this series made it really hard to watch. While the yodeling mezzo soprano (or alto?) mangles songs like ""The Three Ravens"" and ""God Save the King"" I found it really hard to give the history lesson my attention. As she warbles in and out of key I had to wonder why the director of the series didn't choose silence over this vocalization. Is she some relative?"
4,3 and a half to 4,"Enjoyed the series. Good value for the money. Would have liked Shama to provide a bit more continuity. He seems to skip over some large sections of time with nary a word. Probably could have fit in a quick 30 second blurb here and there, instead of seeing that damn eagle or peacock for the 47th time.Shama really REALLY likes Victoria, at the cost of giving even a little explanation of who some of the groups he mentions are (ie Roundheads and Cavaliers).My complaints are fairly minor overall. For today's TV, this was pretty good."
4,A History of Britain,"An interesting film about the British history, not a timeline retrospective, but build around some key events, each detailed and presented as one of 15 series.Two obvious drawbacks from my point of view:1. Information about pre-roman history is very scarce. It would be interesting to know, who actually Britains were before invaded in turn by Romans, by Anglo-Saxons and by Normans. It is as if real history starts with Roman invasion.2. I am not a native speaker and from time to time there happen to be words, difficult to comprehend by listening. It would be great to have switchable subtitles. Leave alone people, who have impaired hearing. It would be very nice if they could have access to such a nice film.Pavlo"
1,Very disappointing!,"I couldn't wait for this book to come out in print and rushed to buy it and was SO disappointed. In spite of claiming to have collaborated with native Germans, Kellerman's text is rife with German spelling, cultural and grammatical errors. Kellerman invents some ""German"" words which are clearly designed to mislead the unsuspecting reader into beliving that certain German words mirror English racist terms. Tossing the ""n"" word around and trying to pass it off as a German word is inexcusable for a writer of Kellerman's status. All Germans in the book are depicted as liars, thieves and immoral. Not even children are spared the depiction as inherently evil because they are German. Had the book focused on a nationality other than German, it would be decried as racist to the core. I wish I'd saved my time and money."
2,Oy Vey!,"I have enjoyed all of Faye Kellerman's books in the past, but she is way off the mark here. Her characters are undeveloped and seem like cardboard cut-outs, rather than real people. Her treatment of 1929 Munich is trite and also comic bookish, with Hitler showing up all over the place very unplausibly. The plot consists of an unending stream of McGuffins, as Berg thinks this one did it, then that one did it. These red herrings are so poorly done and so continual that they become unbelieveable.Better wait for the next Decker book, regardless of whether father or daughter."
2,"This is no ""Alienist""","I had hoped for a novel similar to ""The Alienist"" by Caleb Carr, and since I have read all of the Kellerman's works I thought, sure, buy it.I'll give Ms. Kellerman points for research (the side research on 'Mordlust' was very interesting)...the novel was not technically well written from a consumers standpoint (IMO). It is tedious, unsympathetic, and repetitive to the point of distraction.Two points for the research. Wait for the library version. Danke :)"
4,An Enjoyable Twist on Celtic Mythology,"This book is a slightly unusual story that blends a bit of Celtic mythology with a kind of alternate world romp. The Welsh legend of Gwionbach and Ceridwen is the inspiration for the conflict in the novel, but that legend is completely re-imagined to make something that is fresh and new.There was also a powerful human story here - not so original, but then the best stories never are.It was not the best novel I ever read, but I would still recommend it."
2,Think twice before you buy,I purchased this printer from Walmart. I didn't like the print quality eventhough it has many options. I had a HP Officejet 5500 series printer before which was simple userfriendly and the print quality was far better than this. This printer is noisy too
2,out of town. reviewed late,desired more info on oregano and aromatherapy. desire to return for better choice. will orderdr cass ingram - cure in cupboard
3,good book,"I bought this book and i am pleased with it. It provides general info about herbs and how to treat several deseases. I happen to like the considerations, which tell you about the risks of taking certain herbs. Nonetheless, you can find the most info by google-ing it. Good to have it,though, for personal general knowledge."
2,"Good cartoons, preachy book","I enjoy one-panel gag cartoons, and I like comic strip anthologies with commentary, so I picked this book up at the library. While some of the cartoons were funny and others were interesting and thought-provoking, large portions of the commentary were devoted to promoting Mr. Piraro's own environmentalist, pro-vegetarian agenda. While I am all in favor of improving Earth's ecology (after all, this is the only planet we've got) and have no problem with vegetarianism, I do have a problem with devoting pages upon pages to explaining in graphic detail what the meat industry does and how evil people are who support the industry by eating meat. (By the way, isn't it ironic that all this is printed on paper made from dead trees?) I read the book for laughs, not depressing stuff about what a sinner I am.I'm not inclined to read any more of his books."
2,Eric van Lackluster,"The book has many good points and the story moves along at a fairly good pace. However, the author's choice of the names and vocabulary do nothing to add to the story, in fact his invented words deter from the enjoyment of reading the book. We, the readers, are aware of the fact that the story does not take place on earth by the reference to five moons and the physical description of the conquering race without the jawbreaking names. The most disappointing part of the whole book was the ending. The reader knows it is going to happen, you are running out of pages, but then it happens and you have to go back several pages and read it again to see if you missed anything, because it didn't really end it just sort of... stops."
4,I enjoyed it,I enjoyed reading this book and will buy more in the series. It was a little fragmented or something I can't put my finger on to rate it a 5 star book.
3,Painfully honest but equally controversial,"Kung attempts to break down, but certainly not simplify, the complex history of Christianity through the analysis of five historical paradigms. Despite some ambiguity, his work is a fine summary of the past two thousand years and I cautiously recommend picking up a copy at the nearest bookstore. Like with anything though the reader should resist the temptation to buy into Kung's theology and analysis ""wholesale"". His intention is clearly sincere and ecumenical, but the weak mind will renounce the fundamentals of Christianity altogether after reading Kung. My advice: stay alert and fine tune all critical thinking skills. Address each of Kung's ""questions for the future"" with questions of your own and know when it's time to take a break from reading."
3,"It's ok, but not great","I ordered this about a year ago (in November 2007), and I was going through my old orders today and decided to come back and review it. The product may have changed; the picture looks cosmetically different that what I got; and when I ordered it, it was only about $30, it now lists almost $60.I gave it three stars since I'm still using the adapter a year later. It mostly works, although within a month or so it was starting to be picky and shorting. Unlike my Dell adapter (that came with the laptop) with this one I have to hold the cord at an angle and sort of twist to get it to work. I expected it to get worse and worse until the adapter no longer functioned, but it hasn't. As long as I lay the cord at an angle and twist, it works.So not great, but works for me."
5,This Game Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a big fan of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro.So when I saw this game I had to get it.Spyro 2 is probably one of my favorite gamesI have all the Spyro games(Yes,I have Spyro4 for Gameboy Advance,it is so cool!)This game is fun and I discovered some bugs for it online.I even found one of my own in Glimmer at the ending.InGlimmer go to the far Super fly powerup outside the exit portal.Get in it and then go to where the whirlwind is.Get has high as you can go and hover next to the wall.If you get lucky,you'll land on top of the grassy hills.I hope this works for you. ...If you like this game get Crash Bandicoot games too. ..."
4,Bad Ripto!,"This game was so much fun! The hardest part was defeating Ripto. He has three stages! Dragon Shores was also very fun,especially the theatre."
5,Absolutely fun gameplay! One of my absolute favorite games!,"As we all know, the first Spyro game set the bar awfully high for any upcoming sequels! And unbelievably, the second game in the series being ""Riptos Rage"" lived up to the expectations of many fans. But for me I have found that this game exceeded them! I love this game!! It is so much fun and after all these years, it still remains fun. I have beaten the game numerous times, over and over again... yet I still enjoy playing it to this very day. This is my favorite game in the series, followed by the third and then the first! Get this game if you are into classic gaming and/or good gaming. This is a platform game that has yet to be trumped in my personal opinion."
5,Ford OE Style Fender Flare Set of 4,Been looking for this product all over the internet and found that Amazon had the best Deal around and just exactly what I wanted for my Ford Ranger XLT that would fit it like factory. Thanks Amazon for the Product and good service......... :)
4,"Tough, tough, tough!","We bought one for our 4 year old 2.5 years ago.This thing is tough! When she was learning she crashed it alot and jsut a few scratches to show.She now drives well, but still loves to ride off the curbs and treat it like a 4-wheeler!At one time I have seen this car carry her and two 12-14 year olds! This thing actually moved well with all those girls piled on it!I would highly recommend this to any one.I even added some LED lights on a switch to it to make it visible in the evening, as these are small and disappear in the dark. I'd love to see fisher-price build them all with lights.It finally wore out hte rear wheels this weekend. They do spin alot when you first give it ""gas"", but that is actually a designed in action to keep from putting too much stress on the motor gears and prolong their life.My little girl just thinks that's cool to spin out like they do in the movies!"
2,I was very disappointed to pay the price requested and just get a summary of what I had already seen on You - Tube.,"It was not a learning tool for me, I will not recommend it, I wish I could get my money back. Thank you!."
1,NOT the original!!!,I just purchased this book for the second time. The first time was 14yrs ago and it was one of my & my daughters favorite bedtime books. THIS BOOK IS NOT THE SAME!!! I don't know why they changed it but it doesn't have the same feeling or the same flow! It's a very poor representation of a classic with awful attempts at rymes mixed in with Dr Suesses original brilliance! I was so mad when I got this version home & went to read it to my pregnant belly!(which btw helped my 13yr old become the best reader in her class & has always been years ahead of the rest of the kids)So please beware & try to find the original version! I truly believe that origional Dr Suess gives kids the best start in reading & learning to love books!
4,Catching on to The Land of Green Plums,"Muller has chosen not to follow a typical narrative form of storytelling of beginning, middle, and end. That caused me some confusion at first. When I realized that ""surreal"" fit the content as well as the style, I began to appreciate the book."
3,Engineering = good; Performance = 3 stars only,"I agree with one of the reviews here.Technically this album is awesome. It can really showcase a good system. The engineering aspect is perfect. You can really feel like you're in the jazz club. The sound of chatter and silverware clacking is distinct from the music. The instruments breath so much naturalness.Unfortunately I don't listen to this anymore. If you ignore the perfect engineering of this CD you'll notice that the performance is actually not that good. Seems like a lot of times the band members were just ""jamming"". I'm sure they had a fun time playing that night but the music is not that good actually."
1,"Incest, Murder and Inbreeding couln't save the plot","The only interesting element of this book was the freakish personal life of the family it portrayed. The only survivor of the murders, the dimwitted son Kenny, was one of two illegitimate sons born to parents who were also brother and sister. The sons, the parents and two elderly aunts lived in such a state of squallor and filth, one can scarcely imagine it. The book takes you through the long family history, the unsolved murders, and the trial that resulted in the acquittal of the only suspect. Long and unsympathetic at times, this book ends abruptly and with little closure."
3,biased and hiding many facts,"i know chris jacobs personally and i very much believe he was set up mbecaise there are so many things that don't add up right. now that he has been in prision for almost a year everyone just wants to forget about it and move on. i don't think his family can after suffering such a tradgedy to their family. as for kenny kunz a history of mental illness runs in the family i do believe him or helen did it mental illness just doesn't go away, so for those of you around the area of athens and central wisconsin how about some answers from the marathon couthy sheriffs department they seem to be extremly hush hush about any details for this case. theres a BIG secret in wisconsin can anybody find out what it is?"
2,Just OK,"Some good moments, but over all a lack luster production and effort compared to other Bigfoot videos to be seen and owned. If you are new to the subject and want a good jump start on bigfoot info, I would start elsewhere on higher rated videos. If you own it all already and this is your last bigfoot video, then by all means pick it up. Just OK. Not bad but certainly not great."
1,THE WORST!!!!!!!,"Todd, Thanks for the refund offer, but I won't remove this review. It is a warning to others not to buy your documentary BECAUSE I think it stinks! In response to your angry rambling comment on my review: If this is what you call doing something ""above and beyond"" you apparently have very low standards which was obvious to me after watching your documentary. REVIEW: Everyone appears to be talking about an experience they WISH they had had. And what about the guy that went on and on about the film he and his friend made, where was the footage????? I think alot of these people are lying. Partain must have gotten some family members and pals to write in some good reviews because this is a really lame duck documentary.The bigfoot suit in this film looked terrible! I've seen hoaxes of bifoot pics that where more convincing. My personal opinion and advise is to save your money. I wasted 20.00 on this stink bomb."
1,Would Not Buy,"Not helpful for me. It contained mostly definitions of terms, no useful follow thru information. Other books I have found are more percise."
4,I loved it; I hated it!,"I have been a fan of the Shootout series since the beginning, and I must say that when the computer is in charge of both sides, I can play a good game. The computer controlled defense is good, but your computer controlled players leave much to be desired. For instance, they constantly run out of bounds on a fast break so that when you pass to them, it's an immediate turnover. Or, when rebounding, the ball falls right at their feet and they don't react to it. I created a player to see if I could take unfair advantage of the computer and of course I couldn't. Overall, the appearance was very good;however, Allen Iverson is too dark to support the appearance of tattoos if the designers had chosen to include that bit of realism. This game is fun to play because of all of the great features it has, but I would rather give some of that up if my players would react the way they did in NBA Shootout '98."
3,A disappointment after the first two.,"This is the third book in THE LAST HERALD MAGE trilogy (following MAGIC'S PAWN and MAGIC'S PROMISE). After the first two, I was pretty disappointed. There is none of the tension of the first book or suspense of the second book. Everything just seems to happen and then he's going after this antagonist that is even more poorly established than Lackey's usual. Unlike the previous two books, I felt nothing for the characters in this book. The story was interesting, but it needed the antagonist to be more firmly fleshed out and the characters to give us something more to connect with.This book was definitely a let down after the first two books, but it was a somewhat satisfying conclusion to the series."
5,Absolutely Fantastic- 5 stars!,"When one of my friends handed me the trilogy, I was a bit skeptical. I stay away from fantasy books. I lean torwards horror mostly, but I figured I would just try it. Well, I can trufully say that these are the best books I have EVER read in my life. The way Mercades showed Vanyel's life was amazing. I cried (of course) when 'Lendel died, and then again when Vanyel himself died. The books' plots were wonderful, and completely surprising. My favorite book out of the three was probably the Second Book, ""Magic's Promise"". This is a great book. If you read it you will not be sorry."
3,disappointing but still enjoyable,"I really agree with Jason C. Hill's review.It is not the plot or her writing skill (both lacking) that make this novel (and the whole series) readable but the emotional impact of the book: Ms Lackey perfectly knows how to hit someone's sensitivity, how to stir emotions, how to make her main characters endearing and even if the developing of the story is not what one could wish it is very easy to suspend any critisism.Despite its flaws and a serious need for editorial care (so many typos and plot inconsistencies are hardly to be tolerated) this novel keeps you awake at night to finish it. Even the ending, while rhetorical, still manages to work.Not a book I should recommend as a masterwork but a leasurable reading for sure."
5,"Didn't make me feel young again, but it made me remember what it was like",My wife and I grew up on this music and this is a good representative collection with good recording quality. Brings back great memories.
5,Guitar Godzilla,Tinsley has never disappointed me with his song writing or guitar playing. Please don't listen to this at work 'cause you get the urge to grab your Strat and a shot glass real bad!
4,Rockin good blues,"Some very good blues, really rocks a times. Check out Say Too Much, Too Much of Everything, Bringin' Home the Bacon, and Sleep on It."
5,Vocobeat is a definate MUST HAVE for any a cappella fan.,"Rockapella was one of the first groups to shatter the perception that a cappella meant Doo Wop or Barbershop through a combination kickin' Vocal Percussion by Jeff Thacher and brilliant songwriting by Sean Altman, Scott Leanard, Barry Carl, and Elliott Kerman. Vocobeat was the first truly great recording of this genre. It contains everything from the danceable ""U Beat Me Up"" to the Jazzy ""Kingdom Of Shy"" to the reflective ""My Home."" Vocobeat has something for everyone. While the price is high, it is well worth it."
5,1-2-3 Magic insights are 'real-world' and they WORK!,"Our local elementary school counselor offered to lend this video to any parent who was open-minded enough to watch and listen. My husband and I borrowed it, and were pleased to find that Thomas Phelan's suggests an approach to parenting that reflects: parents don't need to share parenting control with our children, we ARE the parents! Part-way into the school year we teamed with the teachers to employ the tactics Phelan describes, and watched our boy chose better behavior and attitude, then improve his grades significantly -- without bribing, cajoling, begging, yelling, or concocting exhausting and ineffective 'shared-control' parenting schemes (as prescribed by some other 'parenting experts') to outwit him! We've now purchased it so we can refresh our knowledge as needed."
5,It really is magic!,"I have seen this technique work with really hard kids, the kids nothing else works for. Many other parents love the technique; so much so that they tend to STEAL my video and I've had to buy several over the years. The book is simply not the same. The best thing is: it works at my house with my fiesty 4-year old!"
5,"wisdom, wit, from IWW to McCarthy","This is an expanded collection of the popular journalistic writing of James P. Cannon the founding leader of the American communist movement who stood up to Stalinism and founded the movement that became the Socialist Workers Party. These articles span the pre W.W.I struggles of the International Workers of the World, the revolutionary trade unionism of the Minneapolis Strikes of the 1930s, to the struggle against the 1950s McCarthyism. What shines in this collection is both Cannon's wit, and his wisdom, as well as his ability to communicate on the level of pure human feeling as well as objective politics in his ""smaller"" pieces like his movie reviews, reaction to the death of a fighter, reactions to advances in science. This is a the kind of book to put at your beside and read an article every day for the joy of reading it, as well as the political lessons."
4,Can't Get Enough !,"If your a Blues fan and appreciate the distinctive voice of Paul Rodgers then you are bound to enjoy this album.Whilst not producing the depth of feeling that a Muddy Waters original might, one cannot but appreciate listening to a great voice singing great songs backed by the best guitarists around.If the only thing this album does is to introduce a wider audience of guitar fans to the brilliance of Muddy Waters blues classics, then the making of the album was time well spent!!"
3,Yeats? Ghosts,"Isn't this the same book published under the title of George's Ghosts in the UK in 1999? Given the approach the author takes, I find that a much more suitable title."
4,sabertooth,"This is one of the books recommended for reference for my Master's in Education and I enjoyed it so much, I wanted the book for a reference library. I only wish it had been available for download to my kindle!"
5,Awesome Game,"LOVE this game! Gave it to my 10 year old for Christmas and he loves it. Getting better ""grades"" unlocks more clothing styles, characters and backgrounds. This is definitely a hit with my high school musical loving child. He has been playing it for hours and shows no signs of quitting soon."
4,Lots of fun for any HSM Fan,"This was so much fun. My 12 year old son and I played this all Christmas morning. He actually played it most of the day. One thing I will suggest is that although you can play the game with just one microphone, it will I'm sure be much more fun with two then you can do duets. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of the HSM movies."
3,not so much fun for my daughter,It's a bit difficult for her and we only have one mic to play with right now but I think our greatest problem is that it's not age appropriate for my household. She is too young and we are too old!
3,A Fantasy Book About Meetings,"The first book of this series was a bit slow but the introduction of the world and characters carried me through to the end. This, the second in the series, is torture. There is almost no action. There are vast scenes dedicated to characters going to meetings. Meeting after meeting take up hundreds of pages. People talk and talk and talk and nothing happens but talk. This is the ""My Dinner With Andre"" of fantasy novels.By the time the book was coming to a close I started to fantasize that one of the characters would just start shouting ""shut up already and lets actually DO SOMETHING!"""
3,Why not available on Kindle,The more I use the kindle the more disappointed I am. All of the series are available for the kindle but this one. The book may be great but have not yet read it
4,Versatile and Durable,"I wish I had had this sling when my older child was a baby. I got it as a gift when my daughter was a month old and loved it. I used it quite a bit when out and about, and around the house to keep my arms from getting tired when she was going through a 'someone must always hold me' phase for a couple of months.The main drawback is that I have back problems, and so wearing the silng with my baby could only be comfortable for 30 to 45 minutes at a time. My husband and I would have to switch every half hour when we were at a long function of some kind because it would cause back pain for both of us.The good points are that this is a very durable sling which can be machine washed. I've had this over a year, and am about to pass it on to a friend with a newborn now."
2,not sure...,"My husband ordered one of these for me for Christmas so I could carry our newborn around and still get things done. Unfortunately, he ordered it used and the person never sent directions. So, I couldn't really figure out how to use it. I tried it a few times and my son seemed pretty squished in the ""cradle"" hold. He's only six weeks old. Also, because his weight hangs from one shoulder strap, it put strain on my back and made me feel physically unbalanced. I ended up having to order the ""Snugli"" by Evenflo and we all like that much better. It's a lot more comfortable. Perhaps I wasn't using the sling correctly...."
1,one size doesn't fit all,"I am 5'5"" and 160 lbs and this sling is too long for me and my son. We tried it when he was 8 lbs and 11 lbs and you cannot shorten it enough. I bought a slingeze size regular which works great!"
1,Gives slings a bad name,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried. People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling. All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use."
3,Sometimes this item is okay!,Sometimes this sling works. Only when my son is asleep and you slip him into the sling. He's only 5 weeks old and he gets lost in the sling so I don't recommend this item until your baby is at least 3-4 months old. It needs a removal head rest inside for newborns.
2,Too big for me!!!,"This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5'5"" inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you. My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby & I got tired of using this."
5,No way 4 musicians could do this!!!,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This jam session absolutely shreds! I bet someone in the studio just hit the red light and said 'play'. This is madness, absolute madness! A prog-metalhead's dream come true."
5,Experimental and astounding,Every so often an album comes down the redundant hum drum pipe of unimaginative 4/4 music trash that is truly devoid of the same old riff. This one in particular is doubtless on of the best albums I have heard in quite some time regarding the extreme percussive talent of M.Portnoy. I have been following his career with Dream Theater for several years and the thunder he demonstrates here must be heard by anyone who appreciates intrinsic music.
2,Not fully working.,The product asked for did not work with either the Playstation 1 or the Playstation 3. I did like the fact that a game was included that was not part of the product I had ordered. Though it to did not have the complete game that I had wanted.
5,Mom loves to watch CTR and kids love to play it!,"I don't even play these games. But my 12-year-old sons have been hooked on CTR for one year now, along with my daughter's 18-year-old boyfriend! These three guys can't get enough of CTR. It's so much fun to sit and watch them play! They get so into it, and even if they don't win they still have a great time. They have two other Crash games, but they love this one best. And ""the boyfriend"" can't wait to come home from college and play it once again! It's been a great bonding experience for the twins and their much-admired older friend. All I can say is, if it's constantly this much fun for these guys, it is well worth anyone's investment in such a well-made, fun-to-play-and-watch game!"
3,Not quite 5 stars.,"I thought that this game was fun and challenging. It is sometimes too hard as some of the special tasks are nearly impossible to do. The track that you make as you go along is really fun to drive around on espicially if you have dual shock.My favourite track was oxide station as it has lots of ramps in it.I thought that they could of done a better job in designing the look of the cars as they all look the same except for the colours. If you really like Crash, I would recommend getting Crash 2 or 3 as they are way better than this don't bother with CrASH 1. i OWN THEM ALL AND cRASH 3 WAS MY FAVOURITE."
5,Great Classic!!!,"This game is one of the greatest games EVER on ALL consoles. amazing artwork and great gamplay all together! I would only make one thing better. I would make harder AI. But don't even think about not getting this game.I can tell you that this game is fun for 6 years! Iv'e been playing since I was 8 and I still enjoy it! Im really happy that sony still sells CTR.And if you never bought the game,you are not a human being!"
4,CTR,"My boyfriend has crash nitro cart, and we liked to play it. He used to have this game until he lost it, so i figured it would be a good gift for his birthday. He was very excited! I had never played it before, but when i did i thought it was way better than nitro cart. I really enjoy the courses in the first one better."
2,IOGEAR USB Adapter with bluetooth Wireless Technology 2.0 Spec Class,"It seemed to work well when it was first installed, now works only sporadically. Very displeased with this product."
3,It Works,I thought I would get more range than I do. They have cheaper ones that get just as good of range as this. I would go with a cheaper one.
3,Good but not Very Good -,"I used this as a great foundation builder, much theory, no real practical application which is why I rated it 3.If you want a Very Good book try Fundamentals of Tech Proj Mgt by Garton & McCullogh."
4,"Loved the content, hate the form factor","There are a number of book publishers out there that make books that are physically uncomfortable to read. I never thought that O'Reilly would be one of them. While I really like the content in the book, I hate the form factor. The pages are too small for the book's width.Anyway, enough said about that since it's not the author's fault. What the author has control over, the content, is great. All the basics are covered in a practical form that's easy to read and understand. The graphics drive the messages home without being overly complex.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in becoming part of the project management cycle of their application."
1,Worthless,"Worthless video that has spin-wheels for 60 mins and text flashing on the screen, it has no audio only hypnosis only crappy on hold music seriously ON-HOLD music from public domain. One my worst waste of money even a lottery ticket was better idea. Yes, it's not even hypnosis it's 60 mins of torture of flashing pin-wheels and elevator music.They even pan back when making the pinwheel with computer screen once and left it in the video then focused back on the pinwheel. So basically the people who made the video didn't even bother watching the video 60 mins to edit their screw up."
5,An absolute scream,"Saw this in the theatre twice and was screaming with laughter. Although this isn't technically a comedy, anyone who works in an office would be rolling on the floor in recognition of the tedium that sitting behind a desk means. Parker Posey makes me smile anytime she is on the screen, and in this film, she is truly the engine that makes it run. The truly hysterical moment, when after receiving yet another senseless memo, where Posey rolls her chair out into the aisle ripping the memo to shreds and throwing it over her head is classic. Toni Collette is fabulous, the whole cast is, but buy it for Parker Posey. What a treat."
4,Good mid level dust hose...,"This is a 2 piece 4"" dust hose. The Inside is a semi-translucent soft plastic hose. The outside is the black ring that keeps the inner hose from collapsing. They are put together so they will not come apart.It is not fully clear but you can see through enough to see if its clogged.It is also not super soft or hard. It's easier to run than the hard black plastic ones but not as flexible as the fully clear expensive ones. Very good for the price point but don't buy if looking for something that flex's like a thin dryer vent hose.Fits my no name dust collector and also my delta table saw. So it does its job and flexs enough to run where I need it to."
3,"It'll work but it's not going to be your ""go-to"" hose.","This will work for most people, but it's going to wear out on you. Places like Wynn Environmental have no webstore (so you have to call and place an order, which is sort of annoying) but their PVC flex hose is several orders of magnitude sturdier, nicer, and better than this.The black spiral you see in the picture isn't wire, but rather just a rigid plastic cord. So the hose is light weight, but ""spineless."" If you have a straight fixed run, it might do the trick though."
4,the death of sleep,enjoyed the fill-in of the story of Lunzie. I had read The stories of her great-great-great granddaughter before reading this story.
2,One of her worst books!,"I love Anne McCaffrey, but in my opinion this is one of the few books that she has written that is not very good. I did not like the book and had a hard time finishing it. The second book in this Series, Sassinak and third Generation Warriors are both very good and I would recommend them, skip this one unless you have nothing better to do."
1,UpSet Also,"I thought this book was okay, until I also turned to page 19 and saw the 666 on the side of the steer. My nephew brought this home from the school library, and he is only in Kindergarden. I took the book back to the school and had the numbers scratched out. I am very dissappointed in this kind of behavior, expecially in a childrens book."
3,Math book,the book was in good shape but took too long in delivery. The exact time should be specified at the time of ordering & more details on tracking should be available.
2,Did not measure up...,"I went with this scanner because of the impressive resolution capabilities and the (alleged) XP compatability, as well as Microtek's impressive reputation in the commercial scanning world. Additionally, the price is very attractive considering the unit's features. The software gave my system problems from the get-go, causing it to crash twice. When I did get some images to scan, the results were not impressive--focus was soft, and light and color were not reproduced accurately. I returned the unit the following day, so I will admit to the possiblity that I did not give it a fair chance, but my patience was exhausted quickly. I bought a Canon D1250U2F to replace it, and the contrast was night and day--the Canon has performed extremely well with only minor complaints."
4,good straight forward documentary,it's hard to fully cover every aspect of his life/career.this does a good job though.better than the early 80's doc where they had a impersonator narrate.
3,Hmmm... not quite the same as OEM,"Once the bulb is warmed up, it is fine. The issue is that for the first 10 minutes after turning on the projector, this replacement bulb produces squiggly lines. The squiggles start big and eventually fade out. The OEM bulb only did this for a few seconds. Technically, the bulb is equivalent, but has this annoying quirk."
3,Pretty good,"The picture is amazing and truly brings you to Hawaii's beauty. The TV screen turns into an amazing moving picture frame.The only thing that bothered me was the advertising on the screen. Throughout the entire disc, a message reads the company's web site in the lower right hand corner in white text. It seems a little absurd that even after you have paid this money to the company; they still feel the need to advertise to you.Other than that, the disc was put together nicely. And after time, you may stop noticing the ad, I hope."
1,HS850 - Terrible,"The Motorola HS850 is one of the worst built pieces of equipment that I have ever encountered. We bought 4 units as a trial for our field personnel: 2 of them arrived with faulty boom switches, one had a failed power supply after a week, and the other 2 had faulty boom switches in less than a month of use. The mechanism that switches the device on and off via the boom is flimsy and if not highly unreliable immediately, it will become so after moderate use.Our technical department had the displeasure of repairing one of the headsets and were disgusted by the build and design quality.I'm not the kind of person who usually writes products reviews, but wish I had read a review like this before I ordered the Motorola product.Needless to say we will not be buying in this Motorola product for our staff!"
3,Why not?,"Well, all things considered, this as good an explaination as any. Unless, someone comes down and tells us exactly what really took place. I am always open to new ideas. Who knows?But then, I have read both: the Bible and Sitchin. However, to sum up, None of this changes my faith. It only make it more lucid."
5,Autograph book of Ron Santo's This Old Cub,My husband is a big Ron Santo fan and I got this for him as a birthday present. He is enjoying the book and was very surprised to see that it was signed by Ron. This is a keeper!
5,Very nice and sentimental,"This is, I believe, one of two albums/CDs which the late great Rev. James Cleveland made just before he passed away in 1991. The songs on here are enriched with the fullness of the Southern California Choir as Rev. Cleveland's vocal is just above audible volume. He was ailing but wanted to continue recording with one of his many famous choirs.I enjoy this album a lot; there are quite a few tracks which are sentimental: ""Please Make Me Better""; ""I Appreciate""; ""God Is""; ""Prepare To Meet Him""; and a few more.I'm glad I've purchased this CD."
3,A recommended short story,"My favorite parts in the story are when Kattie runs to her house to protect her families stuff from the rebels, when she decides to hide from the rebels in her mother's trunk, when the rebels decide to look into the trunk, & best of all when her neighbor comes to her rescue. I think this is a good book you would enjoy."
4,Great Italian prog!,"This CD was made especially for Arti & Mestieri's 1st USA appearance at ProgDay in Chapel Hill, NC. They finished it just in time for their appearance in 2003, but the shipment was 'lost' by the airlines and didn't make it in time. Finally they got them back, but too late for the US show. The band played an outstanding set and although this CD is not a recording of that set, it shows their musicianship has withstood the sands of time. They were a 'classic' progressive Italian band in the '70s and these recent recordings of some of their classics including 'Articolazioni' which is one of my favorites from their album 'Tilt' just shines. Although this is not a long CD, it's worth getting for any fan of Italian prog. I gave it 4 stars only because it's too short!"
4,"Craftsman... still good, but not great.","Despite these tools being made in the US, the ratchets aren't the quality they used to be.It's a good starter set and the lifetime replacement warranty at any Sears is a plus."
2,So-Soooo,"The bracket doesn't fit my chisels very well, I have many Stanley, higher end chisels, they just don't sit in straight enough, and you have to play around to get them just right, however, my really cheap, EBAY chisels fit perfectly, sooo, at least I'm able to sharpen them frequently, as they won't hold an edge as long, but over all, price considered, not a bad deal. The stone was nice and I also bought some better stones at the same time and they are great!"
2,"Cook is Sexy, Film is so-so","This could have been a much better film. A so-so story saved by the sexy presence of Ms. Cook. Her bra-less t-shirt is the only reason to watch this film (enough of a reason for me). The plot dragged and some characters were too cut-and-paste (like the ""evil"" psychiatrist)."
1,This Band's gonna suck.,"This is like if a bad, untalented hair metal band (not all are bad)tried to make a thrash album. It's a fialure."
1,Not Working Properly,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter just received this yesterday as a Christmas present. She is so excited to play with it and I am teaching her how to use the lever. The problem is that the reels do not turn all the time even after three or four times of trying. When they do turn, it is half way so you don't see a whole picture. It hasn't been 24 hours yet and we can't even get this toy to work correctly. I am trying to contact Fisher Price."
1,"Broke, wouldn't turn. Don't buy these style!","I bought the newer style viewmaster with the flat look to it, and my kids only played with a it a few times before the reels stopped turning. They could turn it a couple times, but then it would stop or go out of focus. Buy the old-fashioned ones--i hear they still work ok. Fisher Price must have screwed up on these ones."
5,funny story,This is a cute book and helps teach kids about historic preservation and put some fears to rest by giving some spooks a personality.
1,the quality of Hush Puppies shoes,"I've worn Hush Puppies soft style shoew for years and they used to be so comfortable right from the first day. However, I recently had to replace an old pair that I simply wore out. The new shoes are not nearly as soft, flexible, or comfortable as the old ones. The left shoe will not stay on my foot. Hush Puppies say I can pay to send both shoes in for product inspection, but if they don't find anything wrong with it they will send them back, probably again at my expense. I will NOT buy Hush Puppies shoes anymore."
3,Its a studio band for bloody sakes,If you look at the credits in the movie the band is a studio band signed in with musisans union. It is not a real Oi! band! However they did capture the Oi! sound quite brilliantly and is why all sorts listen to it. The movie is a portrayal about nazi deadbeats and thier inevidable doom as is American History X. Thus is why anti racists listen to it.Reminds me what Gary Bushell did with the Gonads minus the facism.
3,Disappointing BUT 5 tracks make it a must buy,"The CD is disappointing because it features only the 5 songs from the movie but those 5 songs are hardcore. Its a shame they didn't let the band add some new material because the remainder of tracks on the CD are rehashed dialogue from the movie in a an uninteresting format or the same genre of music they played over the ending credits. Plus the movie didn't have all that many memorable lines that the leftist, liberal director would allow onto the soundtrack. Any of the lines that accurately protrayed the skins anger and alienation were cut because of political correctness. Buy it if you liked the movie but remember it doesn't break any new musical ground....."
4,"Insightful, Spirited!",A must read for any military history buff. This book reveals the origins of US Navy traditions and proud combat record. As a person stationed aboard the USS Enterprise during Preying Mantis It was nice to get another account of the action.
4,An overlooked gem,"In 1979 this album never had a chance. With it's weird title and strange album cover and virtually zero marketing support, the album went straight from the press to the cut out bins. I would never have owned this album if I didn't happen to be in the record store at the time they were playing this over the store stereo. I asked what that was and was literally directed to a cut out bin where a few copies were languishing. I think I paid maybe $3.00 for it. What a find. My favorite song is Oneness. I love the guitar solo and often replay it. The rest of the album is good too. If you are a Santanna fan you owe it to yourself to get this. It's like finding a lost work that you have never heard from his most creative period. Not a perfect album mind you, and I don't care for all the Hinduism either, but at least an 8 out of 10 and worth having for sure."
4,"Warm n' light, but snaps and pull ties were annoying","I brought this on a camping trip in Death Valley where temperatures were around 40F. It kept me warm (I had a thermarest sleeping pad also), but the pull ties and zippers and snaps were right in my face the whole time, whichever direction I turned. Another plus for this sleeping was that it compacts pretty well. I could fit it in backpacking pack. Don't forget to leave it hanging in your closet when not using it for trips so that it keeps insulating... I just learned that I should do that during the camping trip. Also, another great thing is its size. It is made for women so the amount of volume you need to heat is smaller. My friend who had a regular sleeping bag said her feet were cold throughout the night because there was all this extra volume beyond her feet."
2,Nothing new here,"If you have read other books that emphasize writing practice, such as those by Natalie Goldberg, a lot of the material will be familiar to you (not only the philosophy but even many of the specific exercises). The anecdotes about writers were fun to read, but many of the daily writing prompts were fairly banal. There was also a lot of filler and repetition. Overall, I was disappointed with this book, especially considering its price."
2,Roland VS-880 Tools for New Times,"I ordered this book because of it's January 2000 copywright. I figured it would be up to date. Wrong. This book only covers up to the V2 version of the 880. I know that there is a lead time in publishing but the EX version has been out over a year now. Come on guys, this was a very half hearted update. What is there is worth the price though. Just don't expect too much."
2,Disappointed!,"Good information and well written, but not that much more than the manual or what is available online from various sites for free. I am disappointed that this book did not offer a more user friendly view, or more of the ""how-to's"" of this wonderful machine."
3,"not ""hang tine""","don't get me wrong...it's a good one. boby greene really writes well.... but it's just not the magic of ""hang time"""
5,"Amazing, the best book on JORDAN I ever read","I love this book, It made me think about ball and hard it is to get where Jordan is now. And then all of a sudden to give it up, and go to through the worst thing of all that was when his father died. Then suddenly returning to the NBA, where he kicked....As conclusion, all I have to say is Jordan rules. ROCK ON MANFlipmode"
5,"A realistic , easily absorbed practice to elevate inner serenity","The Japanese Cult of TranquilliltyA book which presents a concrete andquite focussed practice which subtlyevolves as a path to living in the moment; in short, a shrewd and wisemethod of revealing to the reader away to awakening. This is typical ofDurckheim:a simple and practicalnarrative line which suddenly becomesastonishingly illuminating. The greatestcompliment one can give is to say this is Durckheim at his best."
5,Worked Fine,Needed this for an AC unit inside a simulator room. Did a great job and much cheaper than other alternatives.
3,hot wemon don't make up for a bad movie,"this movie was not to my liking, although this movie had a lot of hot girls in it, the story was lame . the only thing in this movie i really like was trhe main actres's performance. i still can't figure out how some of the characters fit in. it was just boring to me. and it just ended. with bret running out of the mall carying elextra. what was that. it would of been a better ending if they showed her having the baby and what came after she had her. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't"
3,Just another battery,"The battery only has 6900 mah, not the 7800 the original has. I went ahead and returned this one and bought the Sony product. The 2 biggest reasons I returned this product, plastic didn't match and it's made in China. Heard enough stories lately about batteries made in China having a melt down, wanted the OEM from Japan."
2,Do not like,The product did not look like the picture and is too big for my steering wheel. Did not care for the fabric either.
1,Not much help,I am updating my first assessment of your product. I would give it two stars rather than one because I can get it to do something but it is not doing what I want.I installed the software and rebooted the computer then plugged in the Bluetooth. I wanted to download pictures from my cell phone to my laptop. The laptop can see the cellphone but I cannot drag and drop any pictures. It has a serial port connection but I cannot access the phone with it. The cellphone shows the laptop and can connect to it but I cannot transfer any pictures. I have to go through quite a bit to get it to connect. If anybody has any hints as to how to make this work I would appreciate it.
5,The One To Get,"I bought two of these, one for a notebook running Windows XP, and another for a notebook running Windows Vista. After downloading the updated drivers from IOGEAR, I plugged one into each machine, and they were up and running flawlessly in no time.I connected my Blackberry Curve phone, and my bluetooth stereo headphones; both were detected by the computers, and coupled seamlessly. The range of these dongles is amazing considering the limitations of bluetooth."
1,NO NOT BUY!!!,This USB adapter was a bit on the expensive side but I decided to buy it anyway. But from the time I tried to install the software to trying to connect my Sprint Mogal to my computer...nothing went right. It too several times of installing and uninstalling the software for it to connect to my phone. And when it finally connected...it did so for only a few minutes. The software took away my ability to control my speaker volume so I wasn't able to listen to any music until the software was uninstalled. All in all...this product was a total waste of money and time. I highly recommend not purchasing this product.
4,Just what I was looking for,"The ring I bought was exactly what I was looking for. It was simple and the price was very reasonable. It arrived at my house before the Amazon order I put in on the same day. I couldn't have asked for better, more prompt service."
4,Wonderful,My son loves this CD. He listens to it every night before he falls asleep. I also like it because they are nursery rhymes that I knew when I was younger.
2,How to build berms,"The book Beauty All Around You has the subtitle How to Create Large Private Low-Maintenance Gardens, Even on Small Lots and Small Budgets. This book is no substitution for Gardens Are for People by Thomas D. Church. I expected more from the book that was provided. The book for the most part is how to build a berm, where to place it and a plant glossery. It addresses suburban lots of 1 acre or smaller and does little to provide aesthetic recommendations, just visual blocking using berms. The book contains just 12 color photos."
1,Incorrect track listing,"I purchased this cd, which Amazon lists as having 18 tracks including The Letter and You Can Leave Your Hat On. The cd I got only has 15 tracks and the two songs I wanted are not on it. Whoever is in charge of the track listings need to do a better job. It was a waste of my time and money."
2,"old, outdated","this really isn't too useful since travelling in Yemen now has changed significantly. one can tell that it was originally written quite well and written will solutions and approaches to many of the annoyances particular to Yemen in mind. i didn't find a single thing mentioned in this book to be up to date either. the only redeeming feature was the extras on Yemeni culture, history, architecture, etc. maps are mediocre."
5,Simple to assemble,"The bed frame looked exactly as pictured on the web site. It is simple to put together without any tools at all (except a screw driver to tighten screws). I was looking for a very simple, yet solid bed frame and this does the trick. It was also very afforadble."
3,Not Amazing at all,"First of all let me say that the video in this DVD is excellent. The shots, camara angles, the crazy video of the crowd, and the editing is extremely pleasing.... This is an insane party and while watching it you can actually feel the same energy all those thousands of people are feeling.The music is also pretty good. There are some very good tracks on this DVD, so as far as the music goes I will give it a 4 out of 5.Now the bad part: I read somebody else's review who said they bought the DVD in order to see F.S.'s mixing skills... WHAT MIXING SKILLS??? This guy has absolutly NO idea whatsoever of how to mix. In the whole set NOT ONCE does he match a single beat from two different songs. I believe that fatboy should stick to producing music instead of djing because its painful to watch him try to mix 2 songs...But overall this DVD is a lot of fun to watch and looks GREAT on a car screen, but if you are a die hard fan of mixing, keep away and save yourself the pain..."
4,I was there so :P,"All I can say is, if you couldn't be there because you dont live in the UK, then get this DVD!This DVD sums up everything that is Fatboy Slim, its brilliant, the way he can get a crowd going is like no other DJ, and playing a free gig in his home town, well, it was bound to be big.This DVD does contain most of the tracks that Fatboy played, but not all. If there is a DVD out there of the first Big Beach Boutique get that one, it was better than the second, but not as big. Brighton is a town of about 300,000 people, and 260,000 or so were on the beach, one of the best experiences of my life and everytime I watch this DVD it brings memories back. Get this DVD, the crowd shots cant do it justice, but, Get this DVD."
2,Excruciatingly lame,"I rented this movie because I've been a fan of Stevie Nicks for about 30 years. What a HUGE disappointment! Thing is, it could have been a great film. The premise held a lot of potential and the main actors were a cut above the usual indie fare. Anyway, it wasn't a total loss because of Karen Black's cameo. Who knew she could sing?! I was blown away. Wish she recorded an album or two. She should seriously consider torch as a career."
5,Great System,We are very pleased with our purchase. The sound is great and the set up was very easy.
4,Be certain this is what you want,"I bought the Sony Bravia DAV-HDX265 with a Sony Bravia HD LCD TV at the same time. You can get true surround sound from the Home Theater when the audio/video source is a DVD played on the system. However, if you have any other source of audio/video (HD antenna, cable box, satellite box, Fios TV box) then you will not get true surround sound because there is only a pair of analog audio inputs. There is no digital optical or digital coax audio inputs on the Home Theater. This may be all you need, but make sure this is the right product for you. (You can use Dolby Pro Logic to get the output of 2 channel audio to all 5 speakers.)"
5,Sony Bravia Theater System,"Sound is excellent. Sounds like thunder when an action scene is on TV. It converts older DVDs to an amazing picture on my HD TV. Shipping was fast, I got it in 2 days, without special shipping. Thank you for a quality product."
2,Easily susceptible to pull attack,"I will be returning this lock. Anyone can easily unlock it with a simple pull attack in under 30 seconds. No tools needed. I live in a low crime area and wanted a lightweight lock for quick stops, but this is just false security."
5,Smoothing...defintely a keeper!,"You'll be playing this CD at home,in the office and on the road. The melodies and lyrics are captivating. Lynne's voice evoks a time when life was truly a ""holiday""."
3,Quite an outdated book about Im Kwon-taek,"The last movie mentioned by the author is Tae-baek Mountains, but ""Chun-hyang"" seems to be too new for the author already, not to mention the ""Chwi-hwa-seon"" as well. But it gives us some knowledge about the idea of Im's movie. Quite good if you are facinated by Im's movie and want to know more about him, especially his past."
1,A decent product till it breaks,"What a boondogle. Read about this scanner anywhere and you will see the scan light goes out pretty quickly and is not replaceable. What a rip-off. I didn't throw my 1-and-1/2-year-old one away. I keep it in sight to remind me to never again to buy anything from Microtek. That would be a ""no stars"" review if they would let me."
1,Please don't waste your money!,"I had the exact same problem as many others. Used the thing for 1 year and the bulb died, this was after Very light use. Maybe a dozen or so scans.. very very dissapointing.We had to have a working scanner though (I work in a university Music Library and faculty need it) so we actually sent the thing in for repair. It cost $300 + shipping to CA and back, and when it came back, it died again in 6 mos.I'm buying an Epson this time. I won't let the lower price lure me..it's simply not worth the headache."
5,I agree with Murat,"Thank you Murat, for the fine review. I agree with everything you mentioned. I give the album 5 stars; it's that good."
4,A Field Guide to Cows: How to Identify,"Book is good. It has black and white drawing and description of breeds.I was watching Rural T V, and could identify the bull breed the show was speaking of."
3,'Ok' book,This is an OK book - two pages for each of the 21 types of cows. The print is kinda like newspaper print and pictures are like cartoons. The info is short and sweet. It's somewhat entertaining.if you want vivid pictures of each type of cow and more useful information then this is not the book for you
4,Quite good,"It lacks photographs, but the information is valuable. If you ever drive blue highways or country roads, this book helps identify the various cattle that you might see."
5,"It's indeed a very very good ""fundamental"" book!","I am a beginner in using Photoshop and I find the material and exercise in this book are excellent. Althought I only finish 9 chapters, I have learnt a lot and the examples are easy to follow too."
2,Two words: Steer Clear!,"Never before have I read a book that contains such wonderfully authoritative gems such as: ""I _think_ you want this box checked every time you create a JPEG image"" (p.382), and ""I need to gather my thoughts more completely someday."" (p.492)WHAT? I didn't pay for this guy's ideas of what _might_ be right! I want an authority, not some hack with a copy of Photoshop and Word.Stay clear of this stinkfest!"
1,When people think they can rock.,"First off lets just say that girls who start bands are really are cool....most of the time,The album starts off by proving that these amatuers should have had many lessons before ever pressing record on their cheesy recorder,I'm not one to bash a band but to show a side of the art of music that is often not seen......I was really interested in this band so The label I work for sent me to a showcase this band was performing at and the rest in history or should I say a travisty,they were horribly out of tune and very unsure of themselves,this band comes off like a joke to me,Girls get some lessons and then try try try again!"
2,The Cruise by Bill Burgett,"I hope future recommendations do not fair as poorly. I found ""The Cruise"", an amateur attempt at writing, as well as, story line."
1,terrible,"This book was terrible. Melissa Nathan has not captured the heart or style of Elizabeth Bennet in Jasmin even remotely. Jasmin just came across as bitter and mean, not lively and witty. There are so many things wrong with this story and its characters, I don't even want continue. Just skip it."
4,Good Easy Read,"This book was very entertaining. It was not Jane Austin but it was still fun to read. I would recommend this for a day at the beach. It was light and enjoyable. You see what is ahead, but that's because you know Pride and Prejudice already. It was fun to re-read it in this light."
2,Lazy update...but it's still mindless fun,"I found PRIDE, PREJUDICE AND JASMIN FIELD disappointing because it showed a lack of imagination and initiative. I wanted the characters in this book to develop on their own rather than remain shadows of Jane Austen's wonderful characters. It felt like the author gave up and resorted to cramming her modern day characters into the P&P plot outline rather than taking the time to let them follow their own natural progression. I would have preferred a book that followed the P&P spirit and spunk more closely rather than the plot.OK, now to say something nice. This book is not a bad read for lazy afternoons when all you want or can really handle is a story full of empty calories. It's mindless fun which we all need every now and then."
2,inexpensive for a reason,"The sizes on the shank are often very faint or missing so you'll need a mic to tell them apart. The number drills are only approximate in size. For instance, the #16 should be 0.177"" but was 0.171"". Many of the smaller drills are actually the same size rather than getting progresively smaller. #45-47 were all 0.0081"", #39-42 were all 0.0096"", #35-37 were all 0.104"". If you need the precision offered by a 115 drill bit set, this isn't the set you should get."
4,Great book but...,The book is great... the information it has is simple priceless... but...the pages simple fall down of the spine.They actually made the book in America but the quality in binding isso poor the could be made in china. So... buy the kindle version. I give10 stars out of 5 for the priceless information. and 1 for the poor binding.
2,Definitely unfinshed.,"This game started out great and looked so promising, after about an hour you'll find out just how right I am. The actual upgrades in the game are unimpressive, you would expect something cool to happen like, longer range, splitting into more. But nothing, it's repeditive and is old after 1-2 hours. The only real pluses to this game is it's a okay shooter with some de-limbing. But really there's better games for your money. This game looked so good early on but the end was obviously unfinished and unpolished."
4,fun game to play,this is a fun game a little short but still fun and most of the fun ones are short. you play as a sort of one man assasin for an organization that is all and you get infeceted buy a drug that turns your skin at least part of your skin to metal and you get this cool glave that you trow like a boomerage and as you play thought the game you get some neat tricks you can do with it. and you can buy differnt guns also to use in the game. you fight these military type of people as well as other infected beings that look more like zombies. and some other weird looking creatures. so it is a shooter type of game with a little mystery involved but i beat the game twice already and im a older player so if you like a simple easy game to play that dosnt involve a lot of button movement or configuration then give this a chance. thers also going to be a dark sector 2 comeing up. so if you like this game you will look forward to the second one comeing out like I do.
4,Great Game,"While this game does have a few minor flaws it did manage to keep me interested all the way til the end, i really enjoyed the combat system as it is very similar to gears of war, and being a fan of anime type shows aswell as guyver, i really dug the whole alien suit with special abilities angle they went for , but yea it aint perfect but it does the job and as for multi player everytime i logged on no games were in session but it could just be my location. sooo if your a fan of action games try renting it first but if you like action and anime/guyver type stuff def get it you won't regret it."
4,3.5 stars..,"This is an all around solid game, but nothing extraordinary. The game has good legnth(10-20), and has fairly new gameplay. The gameplay isn't copy-cat, its just not that fun to do honestly. The first half is awesome and your looking forward to more and more. However, the game does nothing new as the story progresses. You just battle a half dozen enemies, duck when needed, fire when ready, and thats really it. I havent finished the game but I would say its around a 7.0-8.0 range. If you see it for 30 or less pick it up , but for more than that, not really."
4,gets boring after while,in the beginning it gets really fun then the store mod goes down hill but is really fun i would try it gave it a shot
2,Too frustrating,"The main flaw about this game is that if you decide to quit in the middle of a chapter (even though it says ""saving"" during parts of a chapter) and later when you load your game ready to play again expecting to be at that point you quit at last time; it doesn't happen. You have to start the whole chapetr all over again. I have to agree with another reviewer this game is pretty repeative, all the enemies do the same thing. I got bored with this game quick. Maybe this is worth a rental but definately not worth spending your hard earned $$$."
3,Decent tool bag.,This is a well built bag and folds up nicely when empty but if you put a tool in every pocket it won't fold flat as easy and doesn't really have a decent place to put a voltmeter. I would recommend purchasing the larger CLC bag if you plan to carry a lot of hand tools.
4,I think you have missed something here.....,"I have not read all the reviews, but based on the one's I have, it looks like none have caught what this movie actually was. Like Billy Budd, this was not a tale of redemption (though it could be seen as that). It was the tale of Jesus. She was doubted and crucified(shot), she saved the world (town) and she rose from the dead (the new girl with a living child). She also raised the dead (EB's son), forgave those who tresspassed against her (the husband of her friend), was falsely accused,healed the sick (finding that the trees provide a cure for cancer).Love the film - though I do not fall for the message - but if you did not spot that, I suggest you watch it again......"
3,See the play!,"I rented this movie only after having seen the play. The play, written by James Valcq and Fred Alley did MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS to the storyline of the movie! The movie only gets a 3, the play, 10+For fans of this movie, I highly recommend the theatrical production! You won't be disappointed!"
4,"A young, idealistic, Australian girl learns about life,love and intrigue working in the League of Nations in the 1920's.","Frank Moorhouse provides a satisfying account of the heady days of the League of Nations when hopes were high for world peace and WW2 unseen on the horizon. The young heroine, Edith, has much to learn about protocol, rules and diplomacy but soon makes her mark within the League. She also has much to learn about people and relationships, including the seedy side of life in Geneva.Moorhouse is not afraid to give us intimate details of Edith's sexual education. At times she seems quite brash which also carries over into her working life. She manages to lead quite a charmed life without much thought of the consequences of some of the very unconventional decisions she makes at work. Some attitudes now seem dated; for example Edith is in favour of human eugenics."
3,Uses SD/MMC,"It should be noted that this Kodak camera, while not using CompactFlash or SmartMedia, the ""usual"" memory cards used in digicams, uses the smaller SD/MMC format. Those of you using the newer Palms will recognize this memory format, as it is the same memory used in the newer Palms (including the m5xx, m125, m130, and m700s)BTW, I'm not a kid, I just didn't want to register."
4,"Great camera, but the picture speed!","My parents bought my wife and I this camera as a gift when they found out their first grandchild was on the way. We love the camera and use it often. The software that comes with it is slick and easy to use and makes picture organization a snap.Just for fun I timed how long it took for us to take pictures of our daughter, load them in the computer from the camera, reduce the size of the image (I take my pictures at the highest quality and reduce the image size in MS Paint by 50%. File size goes from more than 600KB to usually around 60KB to 80KB) and send them in an email. Less than 5 minutes. Talk about happy grandparents! We are separated by over 800 miles so to get near real time baby updates can't be beatThe one any major draw back to the camera is the slow picture speed. When you are trying to take a picture of a wiggling baby it can be frustrating to miss that cute pose you were shooting for. This can be VERY frustrating."
3,Even worked on a Linux computer,"I got this camera as a gift. Within 5 minutes of opening the box, I was taking photos. It is that easy to use. There is a delay when pressing the button, as the other reviewers have mentioned, which is fairly frustrating and makes spontaneous shots difficult. ""Rapid-fire"" picture taking is impossible with this camera. However, it's very easy to use and it does produce good looking photos. It even worked on my Linux Mandrake 9.1 workstation with the included USB cable straight away without any fuss. But I was a little dismayed at all the expensive options like the docking station. It didn't come with an AC adapter either. That seemed like an item that should have been included with the camera. Kodak could've done a better job with the accessories, in my opinion. Other than that, it's a decent low-end digital camera that is easy to use."
1,certainly not as advertised,"Poorly packed and not as good as advertised. The software was missing and when I contacted the owner he stated that it was in the package. He then stated that I was right and he sent me a link for Kodak to download the drivers etc. for the camera. This didn`t work out at all. I was lucky enough to find someone with the software that should have been in the package, and I solved the problem myself. The camera was NOT of good quality and condition, as stated in the add.""Let the buyer beware"""
3,BAD SOFTWARE,"I just recently left a fine review of this little Kodak camera, which is a good beginner camera with good pictures. However, after using the Kodak software for maybe the 12th time, it decides to stop working. I had to uninstall it because it would not load my albums or pictures, and when I uninstalled it, it told me that I could not use it anymore, that my connections failed. After 7 frustrating trys, I boxed the camera back up to take it back. AFter all, what good is the camera, if you can't use the software? Very Very frustrating......."
2,Great food - poor service,"I received my order and was very pleased with the quality of the food. However, I was missing an item and in spite of several emails to the company and a couple of phone calls, I have yet to receive a refund for the missing item."
2,Blade hone go home!,"I bought this for light touch-up on planer blades between sharpening; It didn't do much. I think for this to be effective, it needs to include some sort of attatchment for maintaining an angle against the cutting blade. It is supposed to work by just putting the edge of the plastic against the cutter knife, and sliding back and forth a few times at the appropriate angle. Well, unless you've got robotically perfect arms, you're not going to be able to keep the angle correct. If you could maintain that angle, you might be able to touch up a micro bevel, but nothing substantial at all. They were relatively effective when removing the burr created though. That aspect was pretty foolproof. They cost me less than a professional sharpening, so I figure I'm not out too much, but I certainly wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
3,Cute and Funny!,Sometimes you want a book to read that is easy to follow the story line well this is it. Cute little book but funny in some parts! I would enjoyed this book.
4,What Fun!,"This was a delightful easy read. Certainly not romance - but with ""crib"" in the title, one would not expect that - and not quite chick-lit. Suffice to say it can't be forced into a genre mold as it stands alone - its own unique tour de force. I enjoyed the author's voice tremendously going from adorable to snappy and witty. The pace was measured out perfectly, the plot engaging and the characters fleshed out so much so I truly feel I know a few of them (especially Anjoli!) in true life.If you're looking for a deep, heavy, melodramatic read, this ain't it. If you want fun, light,and intelligent - something which will leave a smile on your face - by all means - INDUGLE!"
1,This Product Is Terrible,"The color is beautiful - unfortunately it doesn't stay on the steering wheel. It lasted only a few days, if that. It kept coming off and I had to keep reattaching it. Unfortunately, the elastic gave out and now it doesn't work at all. I'm still searching for my receipt so I can inquire about a refund. I'd like to get another steering wheel cover from another company - I certainly wouldn't order this product again."
2,Not as good as the first one,"I am quite disappointed with this latest offering from Tad. I have read all of his other books, and this one is nearly bereft of action and cohesion. The book is one long, disconnected and chaotic chase scene. The kaledescopic change of perspective is prohibitive to getting involved with the plot. The few strong characters, Renie, Xabbu and Gardiner stumble and tumble helter skelter through the ether, struggling to remember what their original goal was entering the Otherworld. I have to admit I will pause before purchasing the third for $25. Money spent better on worthier tomes..."
3,Seen it all before,"I read this one because I was going to be on an airplane for 5 hours. Travelling down a river through gates... hmmm... Hyperion/Endymion did it better. And visiting all sorts of wonderful fictional universes because if somebody can think it up, then it can exist? Number of the Beast might not be Heinlein's best work, but he beat this one out by a few decades. The difference between those books and this one is that those had a complete plot.I found it entertaining primarily in the ""Now I know these characters and I want to see what happens to them"" way. I'll buy the third one because I know the characters and have gotten used to them, not because I expect to see any great literature."
3,Slower than the first.,"This time around The Otherland Series made plot turns that to me actually slowed the story down. In an attempt to make the story more complex, Williams splits the group of travelers up into different simulations. Some of the simulations were useless and very difficult to get through. For example , the whole vegetable and kitchen utensile battle seemed contrived and told the reader absolutely nothing about the story. Renie and Xabbu were also split up from the group but yet they really didn't learn anything more than What Orlando and Fredricks did. On the other hand Paul Jonas's Character became more and more interesting while he regained his memory. Also the villians were developed in a much more intricate way as we learn more about what the whole mystery is about.Overall the story is still one of the most original and interesting sci-fi novels I've read but would've had a quicker pace if it left out the different simualtions."
2,A little heavy on the scenery,"I must admit, I thought the first series I read by him (...green angel tower or whatever...) was a good story with decent writing. Unfortunately I found this series to be WAY too slow. Not to say it doesn't have any redeeming qualities at all .... I read the first book and found it mildly interesting so I went ahead and bought the second one. Like the pathetic series lover that I am, I even bought the third, which I'm reading now. Sort of. I tend to fall asleep after just 8 or 9 pages of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happening. I really can't tolerate the ""Steven King"" style of over-desciptiveness. If you don't have any light forms of ADHD then perhaps you will enjoy this book immensely, but if you're like me, save some money and just let this series go."
3,Get on with it already,"Having read Mr Williams' Memory, Sorrow & Thorn trilogy, I knew I was in for a slow start to this series (though Mr. Williams politely reminds the reader to think of Otherland as one continuous book in four volumes). After being quite satisfied with the first installment, I was looking forward to him picking up the pace in the second. Unfortunately, Mr. Williams just seems to use this installment to show off the size of his (ahem) imagination. Detail freaks will love this book.On the up side, Mr. Williams' writing has a terrific page-turning quality to it (even when it seems like you're going nowhere), his characters are well developed, and his vision of the future seems spookily plausible. I still look forward to volumes 3&4, I just hope he puts a little more ""pep"" in his delivery."
3,make sure you get the cable you need!,"Badly worded. To me, ""tamaya female to mini tamaya female adaptor"" means ""if you have a device that presents a tamaya female socket and you put this adaptor on it, you'll convert your cable so that it now presents a mini tamaya female socket."".No, that's not what this does. This is a cable that has a tamaya female on one end and a mini tamaya female on the other end, ie it's really a tamaya male to mini tamaya female converter cable. A more detailed description or better photographs would have saved me from wasting money on the wrong cable :-("
1,They should pay you to watch this movie!,"The rental version of this tape says a ADULT MATERIAL: must be 18 to rent. After viewing this movie, I've found it nothing more of PG-13! I have decided that the only reason it says Adult material is to peak intrest in this slow, un-original, turkey of a movie. It's all about a vampire working as a collage professor who wants to make more vampiers for some reason never realy explaind. He makes a chemical which turns people in to vampires. Thats it. No more plot. The villian is defeated in the end and our hero goes of with the female lead. BORING!! it was tough to sit through this movie! Take my advice and skip this one."
3,Get the Braun Oral-B 3D instead!,"The Oral-B toothbrushes are great. The vibrating action really does clean your teeth and gums better, with less abrasion and bleeding. My dentist got me onto them, and once you use them going back to regular toothbrushes just doesn't feel right again.With that said, there is no reason to buy the battery powered brushes instead of the rechargable 3Ds. The price difference is neglible if you take into the account the cost of batteries, and if you shop around the toothbrushes may be available at a discout elsewhere for much less *coughCostcocough* There isn't even a reason to buy it as a travel toothbrush. I regularly spend 2 month deployments and only bring the toothbrush and a travel case, and it hasn't run out of battery power yet. Yes, this is with daily brushing.Anyways, buy the 3D, forget the battery powered toothbrush unless you spend more than 2 months away from the charger."
5,Memories,"I remembered having one of these when I was a child, and I lost mine. This toy was one of my favorites, but for some reason I remembered it talking. I guess my imagination was better than I thought :D You can learn all 150 original Pokemon (the best ones) and a few fun facts about them. It also has a calculator!!!"
3,hmm,I don't think it's really worth 150 i mean i guess if you're a collector but if you just want one for kicks looking hard at goodwill or some thrift store will probably yield you one. You can look up info on the first 150 pokemon i'm pretty sure though i haven't tried them all.
2,It will KINK,This air hose is good if you are going in a straight direction.It will kink at the begining and end of the couplings.So it's no better than any other hose I have had
3,Not as good as the movie,"The first half of this book is brilliant, even better than the movie. I believed the character and the situations he got himself into, and I loved the point of view of this idiot savant. It brought my world into sharper focus.But then the author seemed to get bored of his own story. He seemed to quit crafting his thoughts in favor of free writing. The story transformed from fascinating into unbelievable, from profound into ridiculous. I began to wonder if two different people had written the book, that maybe someone was finishing off a story that another person started.Hats off the the producers of the movie who selected the very best of the book and finished the story off the way it would have gone if the writing had remained consistent."
2,Trying Hard,"Trying hard to get into this book, it is one of my favorite all time movies. About 25% through book and just can't get into it, I am about to give up. I keep hoping it will get better but pretty slow. A friend had told me years ago it was far funnier than the movie, don't quite see it that way."
1,"Bad book, good movie","After watching the movie, I have always wanted to read the book. My conclusion is that the movie is much better and after reading the book, I am more appreciative of the skills of the writers of the film version. In the book, Gump is pretty much amoral. He reacts, on almost all occassions, entirely on an instinctive basis. Yeah, Gump shows his emotions here and there, but at least in the movie he had a clear sense of what right action was. In the book, he doesn't really know right from wrong.Another difference between the book and the film is that the book is really goofy and nothing can really be taken seriously by the reader. The film, on the other hand, is pretty much a straight drama with elements of comedy. The film is rooted in reality, the book is absurd. It feels like Winston Groom just typed the damn thing.On its own merits, the book is just not well written. There's too much happening.So basically, the book is too goofy, too much happening, and poorly written."
3,its all good,"well the first printer i got started smoking as soon as i turned it on and printed , but amazon came through and shipped me a new one the next day and this one works just great so everything is hunky dory.... whewwww"
1,Lexmark INFO IS MISLEADING!,"This printer is only good for xp/vista. It is on the box as it works for older printes but when you open box, only cd for xp/vista. They advertise a website, but it no longer exist. When contacting Lexmark, It's tough luck, get over it. Advised that Windows won't allow them to support the older version. This is wrong of Lexmark and Windows if this is correct. They should stand up and make things right.. They are the ones who are advertising this incorrectly...... support should be there, as long as, item in still being sold....SHAME SHAME LEXMARK!! I do not support the purchase of Lexmark products.. Lexmark is not doing what's right. Bad customer experience... after hours of searching was able to find on website, but not because of Lexmark.. Thanks to other customers for information.. I appreciate YOU!"
5,"Great product, no problems whatsoever","This a great printer, faxer, & copier. I couldn't be more impressed. Every paper printed well and every thing worked with the fax and copier! The only downside to my Lexmark All In One printer is that the paper jams a lot. It might just be the paper, but it sometimes jams. Overall this printer is excellent."
4,Herrmann's score should have been isolated,"With the obvious care that was lavished on this Blu Ray transfer, it is an extreme disappointment to not find Bernard Herrmann's great score given its own isolated audio track. Other than that, this is an exemplary transfer of a film that is difficult to make look good on home video, due to the original cinematogaphy. This is the best that OBSESSION has looked on home video. It's a really good disc, but I felt compelled to deduct one star because of the absence of an isolated music track. The Blu Ray plays just fine on my Sony Playstation 3 (United States)."
3,Useful - with limits,"Mr. Schweikart has written a useful text for students of American business or American history, but it is dated. Closing out pre-9/11, the stage Schweikart sets is not the one we must now act on. If a new edition were to be published, some of his conclusions and theories would need to be revised or at least expanded to address current issues in business and world affairs. It would also be nice to see a co-author to provide counterpoint to Schweikart's biases - my observance of which which is not intended to be anything more than an aknowledgement of human nature. Overall, a refreshing look at the development of the greatest economy on the planet. I only wish it had been written in 2003."
4,Johns Review By Robert Raketty,"This film is about a group of boys who resort to selling themselves in order to fill a greater hunger and in some cases with tragic concequences. What moved me most was Lukas Haas's charactor, who comes to the streets after running away from a family unable to cope with ther son's homosexuality. This movie is able to open a window of reality into their world that no other movie has been able to duplicate. This fim also gives an intimate portrayl of youth trying to find a link in a society in which they are outcasts. I would recomend this movie to anyone who wishes to understand those that society has placed on the bottom and because Haas gives a stunning performance."
1,Dr. Death,"The most difficult book to get interested in~~~too many characters in the storyline, jumps around too much, and a lot of unnecessary info. Never read past the seventh chapter. The beginning chapters did not make you wonder what was happening on the next page.I am not a fan of Jonathan Kellerman. First and last book that I will try to read from this author."
5,ANOTHER ALEX DELAWARE HIT!,"Having read all the previous Alex Delaware mysteries, starting this book felt like a good friend coming to visit. I know all the ""good guy"" players and I'm happy to see them again. The mystery part is always good and keeps me guessing--I read for entertainment and really don't try very hard to guess. All in all, I wasn't disappointed by Alex Delaware. However, I do think he's not paying enough attention to Robin and this could spell trouble for the relationship."
1,Don't pad Kellerman's wallet...,"...by buying this book! Kellerman's not my style to begin with, but he's done much better. Like James ""Book-A-Week"" Patterson, Kellerman has plied out a shamefully ill-written novel to cash in on his name. To keep it simple, you have about 30 pages of actual ""Dr. Death"", 200+ pages of pointless swerve material with un-interesting characters with little revelance to the ending(other than for Kellerman to flex his rather bland and suspect ""psych profiling"" style), and 30 end pages with a blink and you missed it wrap-up and tawdry ""hot button"" ending. Beyond the pale, Kellerman also chooses to plug a former work (""Billy Jack"") in several scenes that add NOTHING to the story. Sticking a blatant commercial in a book is pretty low from such a ""big name"" author. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this, send a message to Jonathan Kellerman that his fans want quality in his works, not quantity."
3,"Satisfying formula, but still a formula","Dr. Eldon Mate, a grandstanding doctor who specializes in putting down terminally ill patients, is viciously murdered in what seems like a case of turnabout being fair play. Alex Delaware realizes that he's uncomfortably close to the case due to a patient from his past and has to grapple with client/confidentiality issues in order to help Milo solve the murder.One of the best things about the early Alex Delaware novels was the spark that they seemed to have-- a spark that's been lost in the formula for the last two books. An attempt to spice it up by introducing friction between Milo and Alex isn't enough to make this more than a decent quick read."
3,The Further Adventures of Alex the Android,"A little Kellerman goes a long way, though that doesnt stop him being in the upper tier of serial crime novelists. I havent read a Delaware book for several years and found this one more engaging as a result. The good guys among the dramatis personae are an utterly humourless and largely anemic bunch, but Kellermans psychological insights his villains at least are entertaining, and the narrative sustains interest through to the refreshingly muted ending."
1,Backstabbing,"It's really sad to see that someone would turn on their own ""friends"" so bitterly and without any remorse! I wish that they could stand back and see what thery are doing to themselves and their former ""friends""."
2,Slow,"The camera is easy to install and use, but there is too long of a delay with the video. When I'm chatting with my family, I want my words to match up with the movements of my lips. And any movement made by me is a blur.I hope I can return it!"
3,"Starstrike tries, but falls flat.","Starstrike is laid low by it's characterization. While the plot itself is moderately gripping, most characters appear at best cardboard cutouts and at worst completely 0 dimensional. This is especially apparent in the desription of non-Americans, who are reduced to caricature status. Literally every sentence they make has some aspect designed to heavy-handedly remind the reader which country they are coming from, wether it's incessant Holocaust metaphores in case of the Israelis or the (somewhat less common) referring to everybody and everything as ""Comrade X"" by the Russians. I will not even touch the fact that aliens who live for multiple billions of years (and study humanity for thousands of those years) are outsmarted via a fairly childish strategem. I recommend everybody to pass this one by."

4,My niece loves Sally,My niece had a Nightmare Before Christmas 4th birthday party. My husband and I dressed up as Jack and Sally and bought her this Sally doll. She loves Sally and has carried her around ever since.
2,It's ok. I really don't like it. Anne Marie Shaffer,"I thought it wss a better CD than that. I am very disaponted with it.Thanks,Anne Marie Shaffer"
4,Dawg Stick ...,"We purchased Ruff Dawg Stick after having seen one being played with by Dexter's good friend Pepper. It appeared more durable than many of the other toys that we havegotten for our year old male lab. We have two now having temporarily lost one. Dexter has managed to remove a couple of inches off of one of them. But being several months old now, that's acceptable. My only complaint is these sticks don't float above the water line so they are easily lost sight of by swimming hound.. That is one advantage that the fish has over the stick. If the company could combine the durability of the stick and the buoyancy of the fish they might have a true winner."
2,Cute shorts but poor quality,I loved Shirley as a child and wanted to revisit my childhood with the Shirley Temple collection. I enjoyed watching the shorts which I had never seen but the quality of the dvd itself is poor. I realize that they are really old but I was hoping that with current technology and restoration of movies this would be better.
4,Excellent scope for the price and size,"This is a handy little scope for the price and size. It might not look like much or have some of the specs of larger scopes, but it's much easier to handle and assemble. The quality is pretty good - I've had no problems with parts or optics. The alignment is also fairly straight-forward.It is a tad noisy, but that hasn't been a problem for me."
1,Disppointing for an Amateur,"Bought this for my son and I to discover some of the heavens, the literature and examples on Meade's website are very misleading. I found it difficult to setup and next to impossible to see anything, truly disappointing."
1,Commit fully or don't commit at all!,"The previous review by Steve Perkins is EXCELLENT. Please read it before buying this product. These edited, shorter Pimsleur products are ""throwaway"" products. If you're SERIOUS and dedicated about language learning, you will bite the bullet and buy the full, very [spendy] Pimsleur product.But how do you KNOW you'll like the full, [spendy] set without trying a baby set like this one first? Call libraries in your area. MANY have copies of these baby editions. Borrow one, even if it's not in the language you're interested in, and try it for a day or two. You'll very quickly know whether or not you appreciate the Pimsleur approach, and can then buy the big set, or move on to another product if the approach didn't resonate with you."
4,Really Good for Beginners,"I have listened to the first 4 CDs in the 8 CD set... having said that, the CDs are very repetitive... This is not really such a bad thing because they really drill some good starting conversational pieces into your head, but at times you think to yourself ""Come on! enough already! I get it!"" But they are really good for the beginner... If I had it all to do over, I would purchase a larger pimsleur set from the start because these CDs will be unneeded quite soon I imagine =)"
1,What were they thinking?,"I have listened to Nickel Creek's debut album until I know it inside and out. I love it. I saw them live and they were excellent. I was so excited to buy this CD and WOW...it's very different from the first one and it almost seems like the kids were trying to pull something off here and it didn't quite work out. I like the first song, but after that it's pretty bad. These kids can play their instruments so well, but they aren't showcasing that at all on the second album, just a bunch of mucked up lyrics and odd song structures. Stick with their first album and cross your fingers they come to their senses and write another great one."
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband I both loved Nickle Creeks's last CD for both its originality and its variety. This Side is painful to listen to - they sound as if they aren't sure what they're going for - pop? bluegrass? etc. They're wailing in a few of their songs. My advice: listen before you buy - if we had, we'd be richer right now."
2,One Great Track,"I bought the album after hearing ""Smoothie Song"". There are no other instrumentals on the album, and that's a mistake. While their voices are pleasant enough, they mostly distract from the above-everage musicianship. Two or three vocals would have been fine, but vocals on every song became an irritation to me instead of a joy."
2,Plug Nickel,"Frustrated. That's how I felt listening to This Side. There is so much potential for this band. I had to listen to the last one several times but it ended up being one of my favorite acoustic cd's. This Time just did not take. There are several enjoyable songs with the best being Spit On A Stranger. All in all the album is too all over the place. It's not bluegrass, not jazz and too much of the same from the previous album. It is definitely not for everyone. Warning! Bluegrass traditionalists stay away!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible Music","I just heard the song Spit On A Stranger on the radio while driving home after getting some breakfast this morning, and my wife and I thought it was amongst the worst songs we had ever heard. It made me feel like committing a violent act. I immediately knew it had to be Nickle Creek, after seeing their awful performance on Austin City Limits. Sure enough I was right. These folks are doing roots music an injustice by being around. Can't you folks just disappear?"
3,Movie quality drops down after edit,"I purchased Canon HG10 about one month ago. I took some movies and played them back via HDMI output of the HG10. The quality of the movie is supper.The biggest problem I am facing is when I edit my movie with ""DVD MovieFactory 6 Plus"" and burn edited HD file into SD DVD disk and play them on my HD DVD player Toshiba HD-A2, the movie quality drops down to almost SD level.I hope that MovieFactory 6 Plus can output edited file in ORIGINAL HG10 FILE FORMAT. So, I can transfer them back to the camcorder and play them with original movie quality.I couldn't find any way to send this question via Corel website or email."
2,The educational design & drill set only works in reverse,"Gave it to my grandson Friday night, it only worked in reverse. So we would screw in the screws by hand and he would unscrew them with the drill. He like doing that, but don't know how to get a drill that works. The rest of the toy looks like it would hold up well. Just need to check on the drill."
4,Great Toy But...,It is an excellent product. Very educational and good old fashion fun. I must say that the design of the package (which is usually something I never care about) bothers me. The box is a bit to small. Either you can get a bigger container for it or set yourself up to unwinding each screw each time you pack it away to it can all fit in.
3,Only worked in reverse,"Bought this for my grandson who is almost 3. He loved it, but the drill only worked in reverse. His parents were going to contact the company for a replacement. Haven't heard the result."
2,"Good idea, but poor implementation","I liked the idea of using multicolored bolts to create colorful patterns.I bought it for my 3 years old grandson. At first he was very excited, but very soon he started complaining that the ""Drill"" is too heavy and uncomfortable to hold. To make situation worse, ""Drill"" broke down in less then an hour."
1,Drill doesn't work,How disappointing for my 3 yr old son on Christmas morning when the drill wouldn't work. We tried three brand new sets of batteries----nothing! I wish I read the many complaints about the defective drills on their own website before I bought it. After reading other reviews it looks like my child wasn't the only sad one on Christmas either.
1,drill didn't work,Had high hopes for this - gave it as a Christmas gift and the drill didn't work. Now I have to return.
3,Drill stopped,This would be a great toy if the drill worked better. My grandson 3 years old loved it when we opened it but the drill stopped in the first few minutes.
3,Not for my guys,"My grandsons like tools and making nice pictures. This is a well-made toy, and I liked it a lot. The kids, however, seldom choose to play with it. One drawback might be that it takes too much time to drill and reverse drill the screws. Given today's instant gratification games, this toy can't compete."
5,Fantasia's CD is mad phat!!!,This CD is the only true r&b; american idol CDthe best song is free yourself n truth isYou may also likeKelly Clarkson ~ BreakawayDiana DeGarmo ~ Blue SkiesClay Aiken ~ Christmas CDRuben Studdard ~ I need a angelLindsay Lohan ~ Speak
5,Enchanting,I was very surprised at how good this cd is. I expected a typical Idol CD but this cd can compete with any cd out there today. This young lady is on her way. I feel we have not heard the last from her. I am very pleased
1,"The ""Baby Mama"" Song messed it up!!!","I LOOOOVE Fantasia, and have from the moment she opened her mouth. Was preparing to buy this CD.... UNTIL I heard that horrible ""Baby Mama"" song. That CRAP made me sooooo mad!!! How could she glorify young women carelessly having children by anyone with sperm willing to donate it! Granted, I do believe single mothers should be praised... ANY mother should be praised!! But this song is too much! The phrase ""Baby Mama"" does enough damage... now there's a song, by a young woman who can create soooo much better music than that. That song ruined it for me and I no longer want this CD. Sorry. I just think someone could've helped her with a better debut."
2,Better luck next time!,"Fantasia was the best talent on the show and deserved to win, however she also needed to be given a better chance at showcasing her talent than this. I think that her single she released is far better than this one.She does not deliver what I expected of her ..Her talent is second to none but this CD by far is so disappointing.Let's hope that Fantasia can build from this album. I expect to see more albums from her, and hopefully will probably be better than this one."
2,Diana was better. If i could i would give it 1.7 stars.,There are only about 3 or 4 songs i like on here. On AI when she sang she sounded like she had pipes up her nose she sounde too nasily. On this cd it is the same story. If you liked her than this is a good cd for you. If your like me don't waste your money
2,Frog Girl cannot sing,"Fantasia cannot sing. She has a nasal voice, and she stinks. Her songs are overproduced, and are all from clicqed issues, such as single parents, and the rest are pointless songs about nothing. The only good song is i believe. But i guess its the vocal choir in the backing, that makes the song goot."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I really do like Fantasia. I thought she did an amazing job on American Idol, but this CD is not what I was expecting. I was expecting her to belt out and have loads of fun with her voice and the music. Well, the CD has very few songs like that; most of them are geared towards the rap demographic. Having a few rap singers featured with her. I was disappointed. I still like Fantasia, I just think she made a few mistakes when deciding what to put on this CD. See what you think."
2,"Where's Fantasia's talent, under all the background singers?","I'm a big american idol person, I watch it when it's on, and if I can't, I'll tape it.I was a fan of fantasia's singing while she was on the show, and i even voted for her.That's when she SHOWED her TALENT.I didn't even buy it, I listened to a few sample songs and I was like""Where is Fantasia's talent?""she is mostly squeezed in with a bunch of background singers, and she is better at singing with a louder, more active voice than doing slower songs.Sorry fantasia, but I'll have to pass this one."
5,Excellent debut!,This is a very strong debut of an Idol finalist. Fantasia puts 150% of herself into the song and delivers each and everytime. This album is a must have to all music fans.
5,I am FEELING you!!!!!,"To me there should have been a Fantasia a long time ago. But I am glad that you have came into this music industry, because I can relate to every one of your songs. I feel as though we have had the same experiences in our love life and others too. To me you are the very best thing that has happened since Alicia Keys. There are alot of people that I admire but you are just above them. I am trying to get myself on American Idol, but I am trying to get over the fear of singing in front of other people than my family. I think that if I tried out, my mom would too. She thinks that she is to old but I think that if you got it, you got it. Your cd is GREAT!!! I wish that one day I could meet you in person, just to let you know how much I appreciate your cd, and how it has helped me find myself as a person. So if this does reach you, could you please send me a autographed picture or just your autograph. Seeing you would make my world!!!!"
1,Season 3 Fantasia Supporter,Didn't care for the song choices. Only liked 3 out of 13 songs. Very disappointed.
5,Powerful voice,"What a talent Fantasia is. I got this album back in March and listen to it still, almost every week without geting bored. She has an amazingly powerful voice and the music is great. I especially love Truth Is, but all the songs are good. Don't be skeptical just because she won American Idol. She obviously won for a reason and with this kind of voice, she'll go far. She is a true talent."
3,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE FANTASIA but...,"the album is mediocre. You can tell it was rushed. None of the songs stick out in my mind. Years from now, none of the songs will be memorable...except for the Baby Mama song, because no one has really done a song like that before.Don't get me wrong, I was rooting for Fantasia the entire season of American Idol. And I still believe she has incredible, amazing talent. I believe she can and will go very far in the industry. She just needs better people behind her writing and producing. It seems like she just showed up to the studio, and everyone told her what to do.I would rather hear her performances from American Idol on a CD. I love Fantasia - she is one of the best and most original singers out there! I rate her talent a 5!!! but the album is not a 5."
4,"Wonderful voice, nice debut cd","Her best tracks are Truth Is, Summertime, Baby Mama...This is a good debut CD, however, she is much better live. When I saw her last night on American Idol, I got chills, and she made me happy. She obviously brought such energy to the place. Wow!"
1,Hope she can swim,I think the ship has sunk! This is not very good material and Fantasia is flat on almost every note.
