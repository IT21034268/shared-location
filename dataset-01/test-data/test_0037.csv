1,Downright Ticked!,"I have been following this series from the beginning and have enjoyed every book (to varying degrees). Crossroads of Twilight absolutely stunk! There was almost no plot advancement, no action, and none of the page turning excitement that made this series a bestseller. Add to that Jordan's insults to those who thought this book stunk, and a lot of readers will put this series down for good. The only reason I will even consider reading the next book is because the series has been so good up till now. However, I will wait for the new book to be out for awhile so I can check the reviews before I buy it. You could skip this book entirely and not miss a whole lot. I think I will burn it - at least then it will have one redeeming value: heat."
1,What they said...,"Yes, this is just a dreadful book. I didn't read any reviews before I slogged through COT, then I laughed at the universal loathing. What can I say that hasn't been said?I can say that Robert Jordan can bring his fans back with one blazing, fantastic book that ties the threads together and completes the once-epic Wheel of Time series. I'm hanging on and hoping."
2,700 Pages of Filler,"Some of the previous books moved at a slow pace, like some other reviewers, I was hoping for the pace to pick up after the end of Winter's Heart. Instead we get a book that does not advance the plot AT ALL. With only one or two minor, minor exceptions, all characters are in EXACTLY the same position as at the end of the last book. How can this happen? All of that being said, the quality of writing is consistant, and if we didn't have to wait two years between each new book, I probably wouldn't have minded this at all.Note to Mr. Jordan: FINISH THE STORY!"
3,Did anything really happen?,"This book wasn't as bad as some here would have you believe. Really. I'm glad I read it, although if it weren't part of a series I've been reading for almost a decade, I would have waited for the paperback version to come out.It's well written. The dialogue continues to improve, Jordan's imagination is lively, and what happens is interested. But the plot has ceased to move. From what I can tell, 2 major decisions are made, and there's incremental progress in 2 subplots. That's it. The other 650 pages is spent in political intrigue that ultimately has no effect. Some of it is engaging, but certainly not enough to take as much space as it does.If Jordan can get back to his ""book a year"" pace, then I could stomach this. But 2+ years is a long time to wait for books that are increasingly uneventful."
2,Start and stop...and stop.,"I've tried to read this book 3 times, but the deeper I get into the book, the more lost I become. I plan on trying to read it again after I reread the entire series, so that maybe I'll be able to remember some of the names that fly off of the page and pound my brain into submission. Although reading some of the other customer reviews has me a bit leery that even this may not help... :("
2,"Oh God, I'm a sheep.","For me, this series really ended with book six. Until that point, I placed Robert Jordan on a very narrow pantheon of fantastic fantasy authors that transcended the genre to become...great authors, period.Now, I dutifully await each opportunity to fork over twenty bucks..Sigh."
1,RJ's true motive ....,"I'm really starting to question RJ's sanity. I don't buy into the `cash cow' thing. Who would destroy 10 years worth of work and his status as fantasy king on purpose ? I think Jordan has grand delusions about the WOT. I actually read where Jordan thinks his writing has greatly improved since the first books.This is so obviously wrong it makes you wonder where he is coming from. I also think RJ gets real enjoyment from watching his readers squirm about some of the plot twists that he's introduced over the years (some 10 years ago in the first book !!!!). Why answer questions when he can hear `Who killed .....' for the hundredth time at a book signing. Watch them squirm, Watch them squirm ........ . This may sound far fetched , but its my opinion."
2,Enough Already!Lets end this saga!,"I f you are reading this, you have already read the other 9 books. If you haven't, DON'T start with this one! Robert Jordan has so many characters that the main one, Rand, doesn't even appear until page 540. I don't think that 30 pages of the whole book was directly involving him. HIs prose is as good as ever, but this books slogs along for almost 700 pages and nothing really happens until the end and even that is almost a non-event. I will read book 11 when it comes out because I enjoy the Jordan style, but I want a conclusion already. All this book did was drag armies from one spot to another with nothing happening. Too many names of minor characters and not enough contact with the major ones. Let's hope that book 11 winds this whole thing up so that Jordan can start a new adventure. The early books were much better."
1,A Recap,"So we go into ""Crossroads of Twilight"" expecting big and exiting things to happen do to what happened in ""Winter's Heart"". Well that's not the case on this the 10th installment of Robert Jordan's epic: ""The Whel of Time"". For some reason I think that the Wheel of Time is turning at a slower rate, and in some cases going backwards.The page count in this book is marginal compared some other gargantuan volumes in this series, and three quarters of it is a recap of what happened in the last book.I was so exited to buy this book that on it's release date I was in line at the Store where RJ himself was showcasing the book for the first time, I get home and read it, and 4 days later I'm like, That's it?Wait for the paperback, and don't hold your breath for the next book.George R.R. Martin Song if Ice and Fire is a much better story IMO."
2,depressing,"As many have said already, it was long and dry. The details were laborious, the weather, the buildings, and expecially the dress and actions. Most of the book is that, details which get to no where. The book has the feel of setting the scene for the next stage, yet in and of itself, nothing happens. The last 2-3 chapters tell all that is really important"
1,flash2028,"I love this seriese and I'm trying not to take this book personally, but its hard. I feel bad for every person I have turned onto WOT. Jordan and his editor have managed to turn die hard fans against them. I've kept hope that some of the side plots hinted at in ealier books would be resolved eventually, while the main plot progresssed slowly. Its hasn't happened at all. It just keeps growing and going no where. My little brother is currenlty reading book six and is loving every word. I feel bad knowing whats in store for him. I would keep hope, but I can't fathom how Jordan could address everything he has introduced with out some spin off books. It is all such a dissapointment now. I'll probably wait until the series is finished before I read another book and then I'll spend as little money as posssible."
1,"The books should be called ""The Waste of Time"" Series","I know I will draw much ire for my criticism of Jordon on this latest farce, but I am compelled to believe that this most recent book was more about the contract to write a book than do any justice to the world he has created. It's fluff, filler, boring! I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and then pages and finally chapters,looking for something to develop. I feel I could just abandon the series and never pick it up again with much regret, especially when stuff as mediocre as this last book is touted as being akin to greats like Tolkien. It will take alot for Jordon to redeem himself, in my opinion, or even match what has gone before in the next few books. I may never know, because as it stands now I just want my money and time back."
3,The soap opera continues,"Wasn't this supposed to be a trilogy?? I think Jordan has derailed any hope of making this series a classic for posterity. It started our with such promise. The richness in imagery is still there, but the bible isn't this long. I can only wonder at his motives. After the first three versions, each has become more protracted with less movement forward in the plot. He should have written a trilogy and then added supplemental books. I feel I have been had and after watching an interview in which his arrogance was apparent, I am ready to scrap the series. Here it is folks, the ending: Rand perishes in the grand finale at Mount Doom (whoops wrong book) and his buddies return to the shire (whoops). Some get married and live happily ever after and some carry the scars to their deaths. And, everyone gets stilled and the fireworks guys take over."
3,Much ado about nothing,"This story really needs to move along. The book is beautifully written but is very frustrating for fans of the WOT saga like me who are more interested in the storyline than character details. It barely moves forward from the end of Winters Heart when Rand cleaned the taint of Saidin. Most of the book deals with the crossroads that the other characters find themselves during that time. Matt is interesting as usual and the others plod along. The new character of Tuon introduced in WOT-9 is quite good. I personally am at the crossroads of deciding how much longer to stick to this series that has truly had some moments but is now testing my patience. If you haven't bought it yet, you can't possibly be fanatic enough to make it worth the hardcover price."
3,650 Pages and we are no further,"This book was not bad, just slow and uneventful. Jordan spends a lot of time descibing unimportant and irrelevant things. After reading the book, you almost start to wonder if he is trying to drag his story out as much as he possibly can. I almost wish I had waited until the paperback came out because nothing changes in the end, you could almost skip the book and read the next and not be lost."
2,So disappointed,"I can't express how disappointing this book was. In the prologue it all seemed so promising and then NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED. Not a single thing in the prologue was developed more than 10 pages beyond the prologue. Rand was in it for a sum total of 15 or 20 pages, and he DID NOTHING. Not to mention i think they mentioned the cleansed saidin TWICE, and just IN PASSING. Also, there were no bad-guy chapters, so we got nothing new there, not to mention the fact that the boring-as-hell Perrin sidestory took a needless boring-as-hell detour to a stupid pointless town and took up half the book. All in all, it .... Please make the next one even half decent. After Winter's Heart, I was just so sorely disappointed. I ordered this book last August for god's sake. So disappointed. One extra star for an interesting prologue, but none for the entire rest."
1,yet another disappointment,"I enjoyed the lambasting you all gave Mr. Jordan for this pale excuse for a book. Thank you all for reassuring me in the belief that I was truly ripped off for buying this book and furthermore, had hours of my life wasted reading this drivel. This is just a note to fellow disenchanted readers, after an hour trying to find a way to contact Mr. Jordan to tell him to wrap it up, I was unable to find any such portal to expell my wrath. I encourage you all to wait until the final installment, and even then, just share the book amongst friends. . . we all have paid far too much for such little entertainment and Mr. Jordan's personal endulgement. GET WITH IT TOR!!! Quit abusing your customers!!!"
3,I wish I had never read the first 4 books,"The only reason that I read this book was because I have enjoyed the early ones so much. I feel like I am being strung along for my money. If there are really only 2 more books, then the events that have to happen will happen so fast that Jordan will not be able to give them the details they deserve. The descriptions of thoughts that were in Crossroads are not details that advance the plot.There was very little satisfaction in reading this book. What happened to the story, and why do I care what happens anymore?"
2,Enough Already,"Yes, this series has really ground to a halt and is slowly suffocating under the weight of it's own hubris. But I will still read each new book, though it's a lot easier to wait for the paperbacks, now. One thing bugs the ever living crap out of me though: what is Jordan's obsession with fashion? He spends four or five pages setting up every scene by describing EXACTLY what each person, important or not, is wearing down to the buttons (LITERALLY, HE DESCRIBES THE BUTTONS!). Was he an aspiring fashion editor who's dreams were dashed? I think he created the whoel dreamworld thing solely based on the idea that people could change what they were wearing with mere thoughts, fulfilling his fantasy of describing a new outfit every 5 seconds.Anyways, this book is nothing special. If you're deep into the series, then you know what you're getting yourself into. If not, well, reading war and peace will be quicker and make you look smarter."
1,Worst book ever written. Bar none. Deserves -5 stars.,"This is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life(or in all my other lives if I was shirley mcclaine). Nothing happens. I think reading the ingredients to a can of soup is more exciting. The only good thing about a book like this is to show aspiring authors how not to write. In addition to Strunk & White's book on writing, this book should be quoted for 'bad style' quotes. Oh, this book makes an excellent fuel if you run out of logs for the fireplace. I don't believe in the death penalty. Therefore, I would let deathrow inmates read this book.However, that might be considered 'CRUEL & UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT'. I just finished reading this book, and am seriously considering suicide;)"
1,Lost his touch!,"Robert Jordan has lost his way, he's lost a commitment to the story, and he's lost a commitment to his fans. How long is this tired story going to continue. Where is he going? It's a really shame, because I've come to love most of the characters. This may be the last book of his I ever buy. Which is really very very sad since I fell in love with the story with the first book. Those of us who have followed you and this story from the very beginning deserve better from you Robert Jordan. We really do!"
1,I waited two years for this?,"I'm very disappointed... a couple suprising things happen, out of 600+ pages of the first WoT novel I've actually found hard to stay with. It took me a few days to finish it, since I kept getting bored with the lack of plot advancement. RJ, we know you can do better than this. You've proven it, so why are you leaving us with virtually nothing new until book #11?"
1,Wheel Has No Beginning And No End...Kind Of Like This Series,"Well, I won't be fooled again. I will not be reading another Robert Jordan book, ever. I'm so disappointed it has come to this, after so much time invested and such a promising beginning. When Jordan can't even get 3 stars from his most loyal fans (the only ones still reading), you know something is very wrong. The warning signs have been there for him for the last 5 books or so, and yet he can't seem to take the hint. I'll stick to George R. R. Martin from now on for my epic fantasy, a man who seems to still know how to put together a complex world AND make things happen in it that keep your interest page after page and book after book. Sorry Mr. Jordan, you blew it."
3,Meh,"I love this series but this was not a very exciting book compared to some others. After the events that ended ""Winter's Heart"" this book was lack luster in the story line. I think this book was more of a segue."
3,When is the story going to move forward?,This book is a placekeeper in the story. For all the waiting (2 years)nothing really happens. This whole book could have taken place in a couple of chapters and then moved on. I still like Jordan's writing style but if the next book does not come soon and move the story forward I will be finished reading the series.
1,Please make it stop.,I used to love these books. Now after almost 15 years i just feel like i'm helping him pay his mortgage or something. I feel robbed that i went out and bought this book right away in hardcover at a premium price. I may continue reading this series but i will never purchase another one. I'll go to the library!
2,The Gnashing of Teeth,"To say that I am frustrated does not capture the depth of my feeling. I, like so many others, suffered the years between the last installments hoping beyond hope that this one, unlike the last several, would move the plot forward. I like character development and I enjoy the art of writing a scene so that the reader can actually envision it. But, that said, we read epics because of the adventure. There was no adventure to be had in this volume. It was a sidebar: What everyone else doing when Rand cleansed saidin. It certainly could have been said, if it had to be said, shorter and without the repetition from earlier installments. And then, the book should have moved us closer to the Last Battle. I look forward to Number 11 with dread. I will read it because I have come this far. But it is the last time that I will take Jordan on faith. If 11 doesn't come through, I am finished with the series."
2,Very disappointed,I just have to say I am very disappointed with this book. I was waiting for some great action after the source being cleansed and got none of it. I think Jordan needs to pick up the pace and get this series heading towards the final battle. Starting to get a bit ridiculous with all the tedious and boring routines the characters seem to be going though.
1,couldn't even finish it,"Not even worth one star. It is a shame and a tragedy that this ""author"" is so popular when genre masters like Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, Steven Erikson and others go unnoticed. Jordan and Tor should be ashamed of themselves. Rest assured Jordan and Tor will not be getting any more of my money or time. STAY AWAY, for the love of God, STAY AWAY!!!"
4,Opinions show the TV generation,"I'm not sure what others expect anymore from Robert Jordan, but he nevers fails to deliver a fascinating novel for us to enjoy. I'm often disappointed in how many people I see ""give up"" on this series. Have you ever seen such depth and scope in a series before? No, you haven't, and probably won't.True, there is very little ""action"" in this book, but after the last couple, what did you expect. I must say, however, that at no time, ever, did this book get boring. There are so many characters, so many plot lines, so much going on, that if the series was suddenly resolved in 1 or even 2 books, I'd be severly upset with Mr. Jordan. Can you imagine Tarmon Gaidon being fought and over with in the next book? I hope not. In an era a quick cuts, fast action, and summer blockbusters with only effect to save them, take the time to read a book that makes you slow down and use your brain.Buy this book, buy the whole series, and be prepared to be amazed."
1,There needs to be a plague...,"I can't stand the characters any longer. Rand is a snivelling, self absorbed, mopey, boring, weak... I have run out of descriptions to describe how loathesome he is. Thankfully he only entered about 15 of the 700 pages.In fact, all the characters have become loathesome. I can barely tell them apart anymore. Maybe because they are all pretty much the same character in different clothes. Lots and lots of different clothes. This book would be definitely improved by a massive plague going through the world, wiping out half the characters. We wouldn't even miss them.I join the other reviewers in grieving in the loss of what talent Jordan originally had. Perhaps he has massive writer's block and is disguising it with this drivel.Get it from the library if you have insommnia. Sure-fire cure."
2,Not Again!,"WOT - does that stand for Wheel of Trite? Did Robert Jordan's wife write these last few books.?Either Jordan has a limited recollection of his earlier writings or perhaps he has contracted Alzheimers. Why else would he repeatedly introduce so many new trivial characters in place of developing original plot lines and major characters. It is pure frustration! (And shame on you fellow WOT fans who gave this book four stars even while pointing out the slow pace and lack of story deveolpment.)Tell your accountant not to worry however Mr. Jordan. I have invested so much time that I will read to the bitter end; because the first six books were excellent and I care about the main characters.However, I would NOT RECOMMEND anyone to start what has become a tedious and frustrating trudge through thousands of pages of meaningless new characters, lands and subplots ."
1,Dickens Has Nothing on Jordan,"My God! I thought Dickens took eight chapters to say what most people can say in a paragraph, until I read this! I'm a big fan of the series, but I'm ready to trash my whole set...anyone want them? The important events in this book should have taken place in less than two chapters. With Jordan writing under a pseudonym and writing prequels all I can think is that readers and fans are being taken on a ride by both the author and publishers. Enough is enough! Release the next book in the series and make sure there is some substance to it or more and more fans will lose interest. The whole series should end in the next one or two books, at the most."
2,Must...push....on...,"Almost there!Wait, what? Even more to the series as I'm fighting through these? Oh come on how can you possibly finish this series when you go entire books without accomplishing ANYTHING."
1,"Sad? Sad is $8 x 1,880 = $15,040. Jordan, You didn't earn it","Robert Jordan is like a successful movie director that has forgotten how to edit himself. My favorite: ""...if that were possible."" I started counting how many times Jordan has written that phrase and then realized it was the only reason I was continuing to read. Everyone should stop reading this tedious series until Jordan stops writing (hopefully) or finishes it (not likely)."
1,Because 0 stars isn't an option,"The production of the last 4 books in this series required the mass destruction of paper producing plants -- the same plants that produce the oxygen that we breathe. Fair trade for this book? I think not. Jordan is an oxygen thief.Here's the deal: Jordan is married to his editor. No kidding. He can barely call what he does writing, and she obviously can barely call what she does editing. A perfect marriage and a perfect crime, for this series will no doubt continue until there are no more trees left in North America.Stop the madness. I'm rooting for the Dark One -- the environmental choice. End this series NOW."
2,Pick up the pace!,"I didn't think it possible to go any slower. I've read every book in the series and its rapidly getting harder to find interest. Please pull the storylines together and give some closure. You find Rand only in a brief page and a half at the end, and boring chapters full of descriptions of the objects in a room or reminding you how Egwene is trying to be taken seriously as Amyrlin. Understandable you need to know some things, but 25 pages of Egwene walking through camp just feeling the stole weighing heavy on her shoulders?? Way too much boredom and not enough else."
1,600 pages of Charmin,"HOW TO ENJOY THIS BOOK: Read the first ~100 pages just to locate all subplots, and read last ~100 pages. Cut out middle 600 pages donate to charity for Toilet Paper.ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK!!!!The story line doesn't progress."
2,600+ pages of nothing.,"Sigh....Anything I could say at this point would really be redundant (much like this book?), except that I'll admit Matrim's courtship of Tuon charmed me and made me laugh, so he gets the second star for that. Jordan really can't do characterization, can he? His characters feel like playing pieces he's moving around on a game board. Anyway, for a *good* fantasy series with convincing, well-drawn characters, one that actually makes progress from book to book instead of going around in circles, both plot-wise and with regards to character growth, check out Michelle West's Sun Sword books (The Broken Crown, The Uncrowned King, The Shining Court, and The Sea of Sorrows.) Mr. Jordan sir, read and learn."
1,Nothing Happens,"I like many others have been very patient in watching this series unfold. Unfortunately, my patience is at an end. Over 700 pages and nothing of importance happens. Rand doesn't even make an appearance until after 500 pages have been laboriously turned. Tolkien only needed three books to tell his amazing story while Jordan is on his 10th and counting with no end in sight. I hope Jordan actually reads some of these reviews and realizes how terribly disappointed his fans are. I will not buy another book. I will wait until Jordan has published the final books and take them out at the library. Jordan will not get another dime from me."
1,Preaching to the Choir,"I heartily agree with the vast majority of OVER 600 reviews given here. I have read this series since the beginning and am a big fantasy/sci-fi fan. I am also highly educated and do not have a short attention span. Not only is this a bad book with no movement, repetitive drivel about clothing, customs and fashion, and an almost misogynistic treatment of women, but I remembered around page 470 that I'd promised myself not to buy the next WoT book for the same reasons. I'm extremely disappointed that I have stuck with this author through 7000 or more pages, and this ... excuse for a next installment is all I have to show for it. I hope I remember my pledge to not buy the NEXT book. And the millions Robert Jordan is getting for each of these ""books"" guarantees he could care less what his fans think."
1,Lack Of Power,"After completing my newly programmed software designed to cross-index all of the WOT characters, plot entries, linked to page number and volume description, I realized I had a serious problem. My computer lacked the power needed to complete this task. Which in some ways RJ can probably relate to. How you can take a world of such promise and depth and drive it into the gibberish wasteland that is the WOT now I cannot guess. But I would venture a premise that his ego has outrun his talent just like my patience has outran my desire to see the end of the WOT as he views it. Good luck spending all of our hard earned cash that we deposited into your account of ""let's see how long they will go before they revolt from my pure tyrannical word processing ability"". Thanks for the first five books. Chow."
1,Crossroads to nowhere,"Here's one more to add to the one star rating (which is one more then it deserves)What I would recomend to someone who hasn't read the book is read chapter 21 and the last 2 pages. The rest won't tell you a thing, unless you enjoy 5 chapters of Eguens headache, a few chapters on tea sipping, 2 or 3 chapters on Elaine and Avendha's bath.Perin learns where the Shaido who kidnapped Fail are at, but he's nowhere nearer being able to rescue her then he was in the last book.I think anyone who gives this book top rating are the absolute die hard fans of Jordan that would give the toilet paper he wipes his but with a 5 star rating."
1,600+ page teaser never delivers! Ugh!,"The wasted pages of this book represent something only Tom Clancey could appreciate. Long-term readers of the series, like me, will be disappointed to learn that less than ten pages of this book advance any of the many significant story lines. Mr. Jordan, you owe it to your readers of many years to bring this story to a close, and not in a single book or the twentieth novel out of a series that was rumored to stop at twelve. Be warned! This book is boring. I enjoyed reading the character archives to refresh my memory more than I did this bland diatribe. One more book like this and I will give up the battle to see the series to an end."
2,Nothing Happens!,This book was egarly awaited and is such a let down because there is no furthering of plot or action of any kind! I'm trying to decided if Jordan has a reason for this torment or if he is truly as baffeled as we the readers by the recent events of his series.
1,Worse book I have ever read,"I love attention to detail and a complexed book or series. The first 5 books in this series are fantastic. The next 4 were not as good, but still I enjoyed them. I even enjoyed book 9 and thought many critics were a bit hard. I'm sure my enjoying book 9 more than most is because I do enjoy suspense being built even if it is at a slower pace than most would wish for.With all that said, book 10 is the worse book I have ever read in my life. I can not say enough horrible things about it. Imagine the worse book you have ever read, times that by 10, and then hope you are lucky enough to read that book instead of book 10."
5,This book is beyond excellent,"Shame on all of you who gave this book one star, or anything less than five! Yes, I can see how it might be disappointing if you have waited for several years to have many questions answered and situations resolved, but try to see past your impatience for the gem that is Crossroads of Twilight. Jordan is not being paid by the word, he is capturing the essence of when time seems to slow or stop before a momentous occurence. My advice: Re-read the entire series before reading Crossroads. That way, it won't seem like a letdown. You will really see what a beautiful piece of work this book is, and appreciate the in-depth character development you get."
4,Too many subplots,"There is no doubt, Robert Jordan is a master story teller. He has the ability to weave words into a three dimentenal reality. Crossroads of Twilight is however one of his less adapt works. Jordan juggles multiple subplots, each in devestating detail. The problem being that the work suffers from a distinct lack of action. Any of the subplots would make a book in itself. Only a few chapters are devoted to each subplot. As such none of the subplots move more than a few paces. The master,would be better served by devoting more time to each subplot. This book is otherwise excellent, and a must read for the continuity of the series."
1,"Dull, boring, dog weenie","What happened? This book was terrible. I kept dozing. To many wining women. The are like NOW, those petty feminists. I want battles and peoples heads, and bodies blowing apart. These books are getting too cartoonie. The strategies posed by Rand and his crew are sensless. He should have smashed the white tower, making those snobby feminists kneel to his authority. There can only be one head on creature (army) he is forging. Rand is turning into a panzy. Next time he pulls his Heron marked sword out, he'll don his ballet tights on too.I'm starting to think Mr Jordan is a Liberal.(ooooo, thats real low, there less than dung)I still have faith in Mr Jordan, and will get his next book."
1,Terrible Disappointment!,"While working at a bookstore in college, a coworker referred me to Robert Jordan's novels (he was on book 5 at that time). I was hooked and devoured each book in the series, unable to put them down. Even the more recent books, while slow in the plot, kept me interested. I got this book when it first came out, tried to read it and lost interest. I have half of it to read still and may not even bother. He spends too much time on details which do not carry the story. Nothing happened up to where I've read and from the reviews it sounds like nothing will either. Sigh."
2,"Nowhere, the plot went nowhere.","Just another rehash of everything that has already happened. It would be easier of course if the books contained a list of characters so that rampant nearly identical spelling could be cleared up, but that would probably double the size of the book. Over and over Jordan reminds us about the past. I already know that Vanin was a horse thief. I don't need to be told again. If I can't remember that, I'm not going to read the book.Jordan needs to give up some of the secrets that we already know. We know the rings in the Aiel waste predict a weird form of the future as well as the three arches. Just let go of some of the secrets. This subplot with Faile and the Aiel is another waste of words. Jordan won't let his righteous character's fall, hell he won't even let them have sex.Finally, the quality of the book is lacking. The glue on the spine is coming off and the binding has separated from the jacket. Unbelievable, a crummy book and a crummy read."
1,"Same size, less substance.","Here's a quick acid test for every long time fan of the series:Open Lord of Chaos. Note the small print, spacing and margins. I counted 48 lines of text per page. Now open the last book you bought (COT or WH.) Note the large print, spacing and margins? I counted 37 lines of text in COT, and I think WH is worse. Additionally, I would have to agree with those of us who say that Jordan is putting more and more meaningless detail in his book for fluff. This is just more proof that the once detailed and articulate Jordan is either riding this pony for all it's worth, or has gone completely insane.Regarless of which is true, it is a sad end to a once fantastic series."
1,Milkin it,"From an author with an original style of writing comes a book that fails to produce anything new. Boring....I've bought the last two books hard cover because I though he'd be out of his slump, but no more drivel, next time I'll wait and maybe just get it at the library.I don't mind that the series continues on but it realy needs to focus on the main characters not get sidetracked and drop some background characters that no one gives a sheet about!"
2,"reader is helpless, i quit","thanks so much for a 100 page 700 page novel. i think it is amazing that someone could compile a book called winters heart, baffle their readers with an emense amount of brainless babble about what color someone's skirt, birches, or dirt are, and achieve the miniscule task of crossing the street and stumbling through barely half of spring. this story line would have been extremely interesting had it happened in the prologue. i have supported you through ten books, however, if you really expect your readers to believe that your players are as stupid as you have them acting and wish to continue to insult my intelligence by continuing this epic beyond its' normal corse of life, then i quit you. i suppose that i may be alone in this opinion, but i duobt it!!!"
4,Here's a Question:,"Will all of you people who say this book is terrible, slow, boring, etc. buy the next book? I'm just curious at how you've hated the last 4 books yet still buy them and read them time after time."
2,Where has Rand Al'Thor gone?,"Whatever happened to Rand? You know...the Dragon Reborn? Robert Jordan has lost sight of the MAIN character in this last book. Im sick of Mat Cauthon and Perrin Goldeneyes Aybara with their shallow plots, mainly courting and love interests. Remember, Mr. Jordan, that Rand Al'thor and his battle against the encroaching darkness is the main plot line...not the sub-plot. I suspect that Robert Jordan is no longer out to right a piece of literature but is only out to make a quick buck."
3,This book is a test,"CoT is exactly what most of the other reviewers have already mentioned. The plot doesn't move and the characters spend too much time being themselves while the world, and the forsaken, continue along at a much faster pace behind the scenes. I ended up purchasing the audio version so I wouldn't give up after the first 100 pages.This book is a test. A test to see if you are willing to continue to read despite the pacing. Because after this, the end is really in sight and it looks to be a great ending. Perhaps we can cut Jordan a little slack for having a slow book in a massive series rather than a slow point in a single book. From what I understand, CoT was also supposed to be part of book ten but didn't fit. A problem that Jordan himself has acknowledged.So in the end is it worth it? I say yes. Though it is much easier to get through if you get the audio."
1,Stop the Madness,"As a WOT reader for 10+ years, I'm ready to stop. If even one person writes a negative review of Book 11, I'm done. This book was mindless drivel, for the first time in 10 books I skipped large chunks of endless debate with no adverse effect in understanding. I consider myself reasonably able to keep up with the myriad of characters, but by now I don't even CARE who's a possible Darkfriend and who's not. Will Robert Jordan ever actually write something worth reading again? By then will any of the original diehard fans have totally lost interest in this series? Nothing of substance happens in this book until the last few chapters, so wait for the paperback or just check it out at your local library."
1,I've Been Played For A Chump,"I've been a faithful Robert Jordan fan for all 10 of his books, but they have gotten worse and worse with each of the past few books he has released and by far Crossroads is the worst. How can a book with so many pages tell so little? I'd advise anyone considering buying a Jordan book, ""Don't."" Unless you like the feeling that an author is playing his readers for suckers."
2,Disapointing,"~I have to say that this was a disapointment to me. I started reading the series five years ago and have had to wait a long time for the conclusion, However Mr. Jordan has created such an intricate plot in the last nine books that it is no wonder it takes a long time to tie up the loose ends. However I have to wonder when this story is going to finnish. I will not stop reading the series because I think that Robert Jordan is a great author and his next project will probably be just as great as~~ the wot, Lets have the conclusion. and the other reviews of this book show just how fickle the masses can be~"
1,Slow and Boring,"Nothing happened in this book. I was so disappointed in this book. After the conclusion of the 9th book, I had assumed that you would see Rand and the others actually doing something in this book. Wrong answer. You barely even glimpse anything of Rand, Min, Nynaeve and Lan. Too much time is being spent on setting up storylines and way too much time is being spent on describing what clothes people are wearing or how they are going to do something in advance or what the hall ways look like. Just tell us the story and give us the characters and action that every one has been wanting. The series has dragged on long enough - give us the conclusion !"
1,As slow as it gets,"This has to have been one of my favorite series of all time. I couldn't wait for this one to be to show up at more door! How disapointing. Now the Wheel of Time series is a deep story wih lots of detail, and thats what makes it great. But this book, is ALL detail. There isn't one advancement to the storyline. The writing is still as good as ever, but its gotten way to slow. The story the characters find themselves in the beginning of the novel are nearly unchanged throught the story. This one in no way is need to keep up in the series, in fact, this one didn't change anything from book 9, so if you read that one, you are just as cought up with anyone who read this book."
1,Jordan should have finished the series 3 books ago.,"I really enjoyed the first few books in the series; a unique, novel approach to fantasty. However, the last few books seem to be nothing more than an effort to draw the series out so Jordan can make more money -- Crossroads is the worst. The first 500 or so pages are simply fluff with no meaning or advancement of the storyline. When Jordan finally starts to move the storyline along, he moves it so fast you have to wonder what happened. Jordan had the opportunity to produce a classic series on par with Tokien and Lewis. Unfortuantely, he let the series get out of control. Pass on this book and wait to see if the next one finishes the series. If it does, borrow this one from the library and read the last 100 of so pages to prep you for the final book. If he doesn't finish the series in the next book, reread Tolkien and skip the series entirely."
1,Should have known from the title...,"The title should have prepared me - twilight being allllllmost the end... but no, not quite - I don't think I could have been prepared for this book in any way. As everyone's said already, nothing happens, and I've come to believe nothing ever will.I've given Jordan the benefit of the doubt from Lord of Chaos onward, and he does it to me again. I thought he was back on track - even if just a little with Winter's Heart - but no, he's definitely not. I'm seriously considering quitting the series, and I'd warn anyone who's dissatisfied to maybe stay away from this book if you think you'd be swayed to quit.... trust me... you won't miss much."
3,Crossroads of Twilight,"Nothing happens. If you are not a huge fan, do not read this. It is very dry and long winded. The only reason for the three stars is that I am a huge fan of the series, and anything resembling a Wheel of Time tale goes a long way. It is very well written, but not in keeping with the tradition of the books. After waiting for two years for another installment after the impressive 'Winter's Heart', I had hoped for more. Hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the next installment, and when it arrives there will be some progression of the story (I think Rand spent the whole book in the same room!)"
2,Lengthy With No Plot Movement,"I have enjoyed the level of detail in the previous novels, but this book seemed to bog itself down in the enormous amount of sub characters and moment by moment descriptions. Very little happens in the 650+ page book by the end. In fact, the only significant and interesting plot developments are (of course) in the final pages-merely teasers for the next book.The stereotypes of the characters are starting to grate too: the men can't understand how women think, women think men are wool headed, men struggle over the death of women they cause. Characters haven't seemed to develop much over the last four or five books.The only reason I finished this book in hopes that the future of the series will greatly improve. If you have enjoyed the series so far, then you should be able to plod your way through this (nearly) minute by minute account of what happens."
2,An amazing feat of literary contortionism,How did he cram a 50 page book into 700 pages? I'm speechless.
2,went no where :(,"I started reading this series many over ten years ago and fell in love with the fast pace of the story line and the awesome fight scenes. In the lastest book there is nothing that goes on. No fight scenes, no intruge, no time went by. I got the feeling from reading it that only a matter of days has gone by and NOTHING. I am on the verge of ending my affair with this series. I am wondering if he know how to end it??? While he is still a well written author there is nothing in this book to hold my attention. It used to be that I would read his books till all hours of the night and get down in like two or three days. This one took me almost two weeks to get through because I fell asleep all the time. I think everyone should write to the publisher and voice the fact it better get better or we shall stop buying this junk."
2,672 pages of nothing,"I had eagerly awaited this book, like many others. Although I thought Path of Daggers was a dissappointment, I was encouraged by the exciting developments in Winter's Heart. This novel, while perhaps more well-written than PoD, is much more inconsequential. The events that happen in this book would be taken care of in the prologue in any other series. Even more maddening is the complete lack of action. Rand channels once in the entire story, and then only to weave a ward against eavesdropping! The exciting climax at the end of the novel, a staple in this series, is completely absent. If the next book is not the last, I'm going to be upset.That said, these were the best 672 pages of nothing I've ever read. As angry as it can make me, I still enjoyed it, and will most assuredly buy the next book. I just wish that Robert Jordan didn't know that so well."
1,"the wheel of time keeps going, and going....","is the one source really the Energizer bunny? it would seem so. i found myself skimming through many pages of boring drivel trying to get to the next important passage that would represent an advancement of the plot.does RJ read these reviews? i hope so. after 300 pages, the only time i've noticed the source used was to iron the skirts of an aes sedai. how terribly boring. most of the book seems to focus on neurotic women and their power struggles. i'm skipping the next books which will also be about nothing, and i'll buy the conclusion, which will be in about 20 years."
2,What was the point!,"I have been reading Wheel of Time since 1990 and I loved the series, but then evil things started to happen, release dates pushed back, price incresses in TOR books, Mr. Jorden missing book signings... etc, and so on. But alass I am a addict, I have so much of my time invessed in this decology? that I had to waste my money on this book.With that said, here is my take, there are some good chapters in the book, but you can count them on your hands, nothing gets acomplished, and you are left with a sense of no plot avancment. That sucks, with a series that streches 14 years now, you expect to move forward,Buy this book, just don't read it in bed, it will put you to sleep.I think that I speed read 1/3 of the book of fluff that jordan put in just to squeeze out his requiered number of pages!In the future Mr. Jordan please leave your edits from the last book in the trash don't serve them up as a new book.Angry WoT Fan,John"
2,"Way too much detail, not enough story.",Robert Jordan's story was wonderful in the beginning. Unfortunately he has become bogged down in the myriad of details and characters he has created. Way too much attention is spent on the politics of the various situations and not nearly enough on story. It has become obvious that Jordan is milking this story out for all that it is worth.Please go back to telling the tale and not examining every little detail of the Wheel of Time's histories.
4,Wheel of Time book 10 Crossroads of Twilight,"I've been following this epic series as soon as they hit the book shelves. Now, after over 20 years, the final book will soon be released which has motivated me to reread the entire thing. Robert Jordan's Crossroads of Twilight (book 10) is consistent with the rest of his epic fantasy world. The plot thickens, the characters have been developed to the point that the reader believes we've actually met them. I would not exactly call this book fast paced, nor any in this series. However, the world Jordan writes about is so full and realistic that I don't want to race to the end, I want to enjoy every last weave and immerse myself in every turning of wheel. There are some developments that are very important to the rest of the series so this one is not to be skipped."
1,Inexplicably pointless,"Hmmm. It seems that lately Jordan's two or three remaining fans (probably family) are trying to bump up his rating from a dismal 1.5 stars (with 1 being the minimum, this is like getting a .5) with lame reviews. This book was inexplicably lame, unfathomably pointless, and confoundingly pathetic. Is this actually a book, or just 600 pages of filler with about 3 sentences worth reading? Can the big bad Forsaken appear any sillier, weaker, or uninteresting? I doubt it. RJ has hit rock bottom with this latest ""offering."" I recall being as disappointed with the last three ""novels"" and will no longer purchase anything with ""Robert Jordan"" on the novel. Attempting to foist this drivel on anyone over the age of 8 shows no respect for his (former) readers' intellect and is just plain insulting. RJ, please quit writing bogus 5-star reviews for your book and get back to writing school."
1,WHY??!?!?!?!?!?!?,"Ok, sure, Jordan is a great writer blah blah blah...Now that that's out of the way, WHY!?!?!?!? I've been sucked into this series for 10 years. I loved the first 9 so much that I read most of them like 4 times. What do I get for my loyalty? A big steamy turd plopped in my lap. Here's a hint to the rest of you who are reading the series and have yet to get anything out of it: Read the last chapter. Everything you ever need to know for #11 to make sense you'll find there. The rest of it is crap...crap, crap, crap. AUUGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!"
3,"Long, Boring, It might be another Age before he finishes it.","I am a fan of this series. I have bought and read book 1-10.The first four books I give a 5 on the Amazon[.com] rating scale.Books five & six I give a 4.5. It all goes downhill from there.Books seven-ten are all mediocre (for Jordan standards) and I give them all a 3. Jordan's series started out with fascinating characters and ideas and fairly fast paced plot-filled writing. The Latest books (including crossroads of twilight) are long, boring, and filled with so many characters I can barely keep track of them anymore. I won't buy any more WOT books. I'll wait for the free library version instead of wasting my money."
3,11th book in an ongoing series that needs an end,"I have been following the series for several years and I'm beginning to get the feeling that either the author or his publishers are merely milking it for all of the money they can get out of it. It's a good book, but it's part of a series that seems to be neverending. I've even developed a fear that the author will die before he gets a chance to finish the series. I hope my fear is unfounded, as the author is still relatively young (I think--mid-50's). I feel as though, I should wait until he finishes the series and simply start from the beginning and read them again."
2,I cannot remmeber one single thing I read,The entire book was like a blur of description. No events that forward the plot really happen and we are subject to mindless rambling about whatever pops into the authors mind at that moment.I must say i preferred Terry Goodkind's latest book Chainefire to this. I am not a big fan of Terry Goodkind but his latest book is taking a turn for the better after two very bad books both of which were about a goat.Honestly if you want to find and ending I would wait till he stops writing and buy the last book in the WoT because recently nothing seems to happen in his books.
1,What the heck is this fool doing writing a prequel?,"Just saw the listing (cant comment there and this is relavent to anyone considering this book) A New Spring? A prequel novel when the fool cant finish the original set of books without dragging on for the last 4 novels?Take my advice, either STOP at book 6 or NEVER start reading this series. Having re-read the books 3 times now (as the years have passed waiting to see how this thing ends..) I can say with CERTAINTY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! STOP THE MADNESS!"
1,"nothing happens, no conclusion","the book starts with a prologue of various charachters and their activities which will never be seen again throughout the book. the book doesn't end but leaves a cliff hanger to a conflict that was never really established. The middle is just filler, no charachters changed their position for more then a few days of walking/chasing/sneaking."
5,The absolute best writer fantasy has to offer!,"Robert Jordan is an amazing writer. He is one of a few writers who produces works that require something of it's readers. There are few books that I've read that I can carry on a lengthy conversation about with friends. Although reading the series does take time I have found it worth every minute. Other reviewers, those who dislike Jordan's work, seem to take issue with how long his story is taking to tell or how much detail he gives. I find it refreshing to read something that is complex and takes time to develop. As for how much detail he gives - usually there is only a paragraph or two here and there in a chapter that are description rich - which does provide a detailed world and doesn't (or shouldn't anyway) require much time from the reader. One of the most enjoyable aspects of Jordan's style or writing for me is the characters he creates. His books aren't for everyone but it is worth giving it a try."
4,A great read,"While this is not the best of Jordan's Wheel of Time series, it deffinetly sets up for a great conclusion to the series. True, nothing really got resolved here (other than discovering the making of heartstone), but everyting that happens in Book 10 leads me to believe that the next book will be unbelievable."
1,Too funny for words,"This book is terrible. So now we have to be authors in order to criticize Jordan? What fool wrote that? Do I have to be a gourmet chef to know that my steak is burned or my chicken undercooked? Do I have to be a doctor to know that the headless guy is dead? Puhleeze. As for repetition being consistency, only in the sense that he's consistently boring. Enough already. Stop trying to argue that anyone who dislikes this book is incompetent!"
1,while i do not beleive he is trying to milk the story,"for all its worth, i DO think he has failed to excercise restrain over it. An author does write for the story, but he realy should look and see if all this detail and touching bases with the previous story threads (which we already know) are actualy making for a better story. I don't think so, NONE of the fans i've talked to don't seem to think so, and i wonder if he's gone back to read over his own work.The plot doesn't advance, the characters don't develop.. there's absolutely nothing here. Borrow this book from someone else unfortinate enough to have shelled out money for it, or check it out of the library. If you have a while, read the last couple of chapters. Hopefully either the story will pull mr jordan back towards a story, or someone will point out how glacial he's become. Either way,i am looking forward to the next book, albeit with some trepidation that it too will be this awful"
3,filler at best,"I own all of the Wheel of Time books, but this one is one of the worst. Rand doesn't make an appearance until about 2/3 into the book. If you like boring details about the minutiae associated with the rebel Aes Sedai, then this book is for you. The series should've ended a couple of books ago, but he's still making gobs of money so I expect the Last Battle around 2050."
1,disappointing,I think Jordan has painted himself in a corner. He seems to not know what to do and where to go. How else can one explain the snail's pace where nothing happens in a hundred pages?! There is little excitement; there are few new developments. And there are pages and pages of absolutely pointless descriptions of Aes Sedai and their dresses...I came to really like the characters in the WOT series but I must say that the book is really boring.
2,Wheel of Time standard in harmony with the telecom market,"And that's about it. The quality is hopelessly falling with no major trend-changes near the horizon. One can only wish for Mr. Jordan to improve his skill at narration... Obviously he can write when putting a mind to it so I guess I'ts a real bad case of writers block. Or the much needed editor has finally lost the battle and Mr. Jordan is now roaming free to leave every word ever typed to the press. Or whatever... Is it too much to ask for ANYTHING to happen in 600 pages? Anything at all? The pathetic ""too be continued"" end is on the same level as the Jason movies. I can't wait for the next book but only because of nostalgia of the milieu and action presented in books 1-6. There seems to be some pressure on the writer to rectify himself. Doubtfylly Mr. Jordan will deliver..."
3,Ok..this one was a little slow (but I am still riveted to the story),"I still love this series, but I have to be honest that this book (#10) is the one that tends to drag on with very little resolution to the major storyline. Nevertheless, it's still a pretty good book if you have become an engaged fan of the series. Jordan continues to take us places in his world and to set the stage for the final climactic ending. I am anxiously waiting the paperback release of Knife of Dreams (Book #11) to continue the journey. And I have every confidence in a satisfying conclusion."
3,Brush Stokes,"The canvas has been laid out, and Jordon continues to paint. The only ones who will enjoy his latest work though are those that have seen the painting from the begining.Even at that, It is becoming difficult to follow, charactors new and old, twist that leave you hanging, and schemes that make little sense. I almost want to reread the last 4 books so I can understand a little of what it is I have just read. I have little time or desire to do that however.So in summary, I would suggest it be added to your collection. Read at your leisure, and hope that for all us aging readers the painting is completed before we die. So we might enjoy a read that we can follow and make sense of throughout."
4,Help! I'm Drowning,"First, I've got to say that if you don't like the series by now, why are you reading it? Don't forget, if you do like it, to have the website character lists handy for the ready."
3,Detailed and exquisite but so so slow...,"Jordan once again amazes me with his attention to detail. tWoT has been going on for such a long time and has spawned so many threads that it reminds me of mouldy bread. If you peer into it you will be amazed at the intricate webs being woven but move your eye and you've lost your place. This is a book that doesn't add much to tWoT epic, it clarifies a few bits and pieces and attempts to tie up some loose ends i.e the Daughter of Nine Moons but in a very ponderous manner. Perhaps tWoT needs some axle grease to speed things up? Let's hope the next book lives up to expectations."
2,Wasted Time,I have followed this series since the early times when something was happening. I am still wondering what happened in this volume. The protagonist was again ignored and what looked like some truly great movement from the last volume came to a complete halt. I will continue reading this series unless I die of old age. Consider that the next volume will not be out until 2 to 3 years from now and you will see that the author had better get serious about the movement of the plot or he won't ever finish it.
1,Unbelievable,"I have never posted a review for any product that I have purchased before in my life, until now. It is roughly 4:00 am Pacific Standard Time and I have just finished reading ""Crossroads of Twilight"" by Robert Jordan. All I can say is that I wish I would have read the reviews about this book before I spent my hard earned money on it. Moreover what I would really like to state in the politest way possible is; Never never never will Robert Jordan get another red sent of my money...! What utter craap...!"
1,Six hundred seventy-eight pages and NOTHING happens,"What a disappointment this series has become. The first three books were so gripping and fast-paced. Glaciers evidence more action and change than this novel. At the end of the novel, nothing has happened. Perrin still seeks to free Faille from the Shaido. Elayne still seeks to secure the Lion Throne. Egwene still seeks to consolidate her control of the Aes Sedai and to reunite the splintered order. Mat is still traveling around with the the Princess of the Nine Moons, still railing against his seemingly fated destiny to have her as his wife. Rand? He is hardly seen at all, but like all the rest does nothing. Guess cleansing the male side of the source plain wore him out. Robert Jordan needs to pick up the pace and draw this series to an end. His readers deserve better than they got with Crossroads of Twilight."
1,Support your local library,"Save your money and get this from a library. Mr Jordan has milked this tale long enough. It's a pity he does not respect the readers enough to end it. Prequel? Nah, I wanted an end to the story, not more beginings."
1,Flaming awful,"Is it bad that I now keep a highlighter in my hand as I read the WoT books? I go through and highlight every time someone gets their coat, cloak, shawl, dress, skirts, or stole described, is tall for a Cairhienen, is short for an Aiel, fingers their weapon, or adjusts anything. No joke, in one of the books one of the characters stops herself in mid-thought to ask herself ""Who cares about dresses?"" Even better than describing someone's coat, I just read a passage where he said someone wasn't wearing a coat! Hardly a page goes by that I don't have a passage to highlight. I'm actually re-reading the series just to see if it's really as bad as I've complained...and it looks like it is. I hear 11 is good. I sure hope so."
2,Does this series have a conclusion?,"Does this series have a conclusion? Or, does Robert Jordan intend to keep stringing us along until they, ""...nail shut his coffin!""Unless somebody can assure me this isn't a never-ending soap opera, I've bought my last Wheel of Time novel.Robert Jordan is an entertaining author, but my increasing suspicion that there will never be a conclusion to this story is ruining the suspense."
1,I'll wait for the last book in the series.....,"I've read the series up to Winters Heart, and even bought Winters Heart (a year ago) but have not read it. I just could not bringmyself to read another one of Jordan's book with _no_ character development and the same ole cardboard sterotypes. Too bad becauseI did enjoy the first few books of the series.This looks like one of those series where, if you read the first book, and the last book, you get the entire story.I browsed the book at the bookstore and decided not to buy it."
2,Was there a point?,"I've been reading Mr. Jordan's books since day one and I can't believe that the author who wrote the first four books wrote this one.Not one single thing was accomplished in this book except to increase the publishers coffers. When I closed the back cover I wondered why I had waited two years to read it. Mr. Jordan automatically gets a two stars due to the richness of his world. Resolving nothing with his plotlines plus adding a cliffhanger at the end just increased my frustration with the direction this series has been going in.If this was Jordan's first book, I would have never have continued reading the series."
1,More setup for what is sure to be more setup,"Hey, take it easy people! This is just setup for next volume's necessary setup of the subsequent volume's setting up."
1,"Read this in a library, don't buy","I have read (many times), all the books in this series so far. I own all of them except Book 10.I'd rate the first 4 books (1-4) as 5 stars, the next 4 (5-8) as 4 stars, book 9 and 11 as 3 stars.Book 10 is the worst - (1 star). Read that in a library for completeness, but don't waste money on buying it.--"
2,Snore...,"This is a book that could have been sumated in the prologue/introduction. It really does move slow, and unfortunately repeats itself in parts. Jordan has woven so many characters into his pattern, that he's struggling to mention them all, and sometimes glossing over the main characters. This book seems to be a slump where he attempted to bring some of those loose ends together, and fails. I'd cross my arms, and sniff...but it's not worth the effort. At least we have the new George R.R. Martin book to look forward to soon..."
1,Where did the story go?,"Two years of expectant waiting and Robert Jordan produces something less than mundane! This book must be the worst so far. I miss the plot intrigues, crisp narrative and action of the earlier books in the series where we flitted from character to character, each time being left on a cliff edge.The entire contents of this book could have been confined to two chapters. There has been virtually no plot advancement; Mat is STILL in Ebou Dar with Tuon, Perrin is STILL hunting Faile, Elayne is STILL trying to win the Lion Throne, the battle for Tar Valon has STILL to take place.Robert Jordan should re-read the first few books of the series to see why they were so popular. My one time delight with the Wheel of Time is quickly fading to disinterest."
2,Where's the Dragon?,"I must like to suffer, because I hurried down and bought this book that can't keep me reading for more than fifteen minutes. So much time is spent on those god awful Aes Sedai, that their names are just one big jumble. If the writer would just stick to the STORY and the characters from the first book, the reading would be much more enjoyable, and would make more sense. I am on page 447, and I keep telling myself it will get better, but Jordan must be trying to hypnotize me with his words that are in italics that cannot be verbalized. I think I'll stick with R. A. Salvator'e from now on.Ken"
2,Time to Protest,"It seems that even authors are not immune to greed. Having found a formula that guarantees him a large payout every two years Mr. Jordan seems loathe bring his series to a conclusion. At this point I doubt if he can get it done in 15 books which of course means we will all still be here in a decade.So, what's a reader to do? We all have far too much time and energy invested in the series to simply pass the next installment by. Do what I did. Save your money and simply check the book out from the local library. Maybe Mr. Jordan will get the point, but I doubt it."
1,Robbed! Robbed I tell ya!,"I was out of work on disability this summer with a back injury that kept me in bed for weeks. After reading everything in the house, I was thrilled that book 10 was here and that it was so many pages since I had so much time on my hands. $40 and days later I ended the book feeling totally violated.Robert Jordan has truly reached a new low. If I had turned a piece of crap like this to a creative writing professor I would still be reeling from the hit to my GPA. This is truly the worse piece of fantasy fiction I have had the displeasure of slogging through.I mean, did he even READ this book? Clearly the editor didn't. RJ has become another bitter hack milking his cash cow for all its worth. After reading the review about his behavior at the book signing, its clear he's another Stephen King. What used to be his passion has become a chore. He resents the job and now the fans as well.Well, Mr. Jordan, here is one fan you won't have to worry about anymore."
1,Tedious,"No matter how quickly or how slowly Jordan wraps up this series, there is no excuse for this exercise in inaction. There are, maybe, 6 pages of enjoyable reading in this tome, of which, possibly 2 advance the plot. This is far worse than 6, 7, or 8 in the series - something I thought, and hoped, I would never write.If you've read the prior nine, then you may want to wait for this to be remaindered, or read it softbound. You could probably learn everything you need to know from the book in 5 minutes on line (which isn't much).Otherwise, frankly, it isn't worth your time unless you graduated at the top of an Evelyn Wood Speed-Reading Class. One can only hope that if Jordan does decided to wrap this up soon, that he will deliver at least two decent novels to end the series, and make amends with the public that has supported him over the years."
1,Nynaeve tugs her [blank],"You would have to be crazy to read this. I mourn for the wood pulp sacrificed to bring this blight into the world. Jordan substitutes character development with repetitive behavior, and story with excruciating, irrelevant detail. Reading without a point. If you feel you have to read this sort of thing, then read Marcel Proust - - you can spend the rest of your life on it, and people will actually respect you for it."
1,therapy,"Reading the reviews here has become a form of therapy. I know that I am not alone in my pain. Listening to others describe their disgust with WOT is so reaffirming.Robert Jordan's series has become the Titanic of American Literature; once filled with promise but now a pitiable heap at the bottom of many a landfill.Honest readers will admit there were clues to Jordan's poor writing even in the first books; mainly final chapters packed with rushed, super-extra-action! and female characters ALWAYS described the same way, (braid tugging, etc.)I feel sorry for Robert Jordan because he undoubtably reads the Amazon reviews. As do all his peers, friends and family. One-and-a-half stars after 1,800 reviews is a monumental humiliation.Please, Mr. Jordan, finish this series ASAP."
1,BAH!,"I've slogged through nearly half of this book and I turned to the reviews instead (which are much more amusing and a better use of time). At the risk of repeating what *everyone* else is saying, Mr. Jordan, Can You Finish It Already?It's not just that the cast of characters has swollen to include the tiniest thread of plot; they are all the same! All the women are short tempered harpies! All the men fret about what harpies the women are!Deep breath. I truly enjoyed the first four novels in this series. I would even maybe read them again. But is it just me or is RJ trying to ride the WOT gravy train?I will not spend anymore money on this author or his series.Check out Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. It's turning out to be long too but at least things *happen* in his books."
1,Lord Almighty,"Remember after Dumai's Wells: ""Bend Knee before the Lord Dragon""? how the man escaped from the box ... I had a chest full of fire on my way to the three on three tournament after finishing that book. Word is bond..Or how about when the girls first started running through the dream world and spying that witch Moghedien where ever they went. Then good ol Birgitte showed up with the hunchback. Those were the days. When callandor was snatched by a band of Aiel and Matt saved a bunch of pissy Aes Sedai. And Rhuidean. The horn and the battle in the sky. Man I thought Ishmael was the dark one for the longest time. he was cool.But I can't stand the women anymore. I haven't met too many women who glare and smooth random fabric, but if I did, I'd beat them to the ground and get arrested -- howling all the way that Jordan made me do it."
1,Wake Me Up Please,"Wake me up when Mr. Jordan decides what the ending of his book will be. I am one of the millions of people hooked on this series, yet I just spent 700 pages hoping that something important would happen. The only thing that kept me turning the pages was the hope of the elusive plot twist visting me on the next page. I can't help but think that the author doesn't know what direction he would like to take with his characters. I really think that the intelligence of his readers was insulted by this thinly veiled excuse for literature. You could have skipped this book in the series and then had someone explain who ""Tuon"" is, and you would be all set for the 11th book in the series. Or is it the 17th??? I forget."
1,Skip this one.,I am a huge fan of the series but this was painful. There is no reason to read this one as it does nothing to advance the main plot lines. It takes two thirds of the book just to get to the point in time where that last book ended. You really can skip this and not be lost at all on the main plot line. Very disappointing.
1,Endless Waiting.,"If this is the crossroads, then the roads stretch out in both directions forever. The plot is not advanced an iota. Nada. After the semi-cliffhanger of book nine (Rand unconcious, source clean, maybe, etc) I was really hoping for something to happen, some questions to be answered, some plot/character development. I was sorely dissapointed. Really, I think this book has put me off the series entirely. After books 7, 8, and this one, there just doesn't seem any point. At this rate, we might see the end of the series by the year 3000. Is Jordan getting paid per word?"
1,SORELY disappointing,"I opened the book with relish and began reading, in hopes that the previously flagging story line would pick up and fly again. Sadly, that didn't happen. I moped from page to uninteresting page and characters talked and dithered and talked some more.Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. I have stopped feeling for the characters that seemed realistic in earlier books. In this latest installment of the Wheel of Time, the characters seem to be going through motions like mediocre actors in desparate need of a break.Possibly the worst insult is that Rand, The Dragon Reborn, (and supposed main character for the series) doesn't not appear until page 529! Even then, the reader does not stay with him for more than a handful of pages. Whatever happened to ""show, don't tell""?Steer clear of this one, folks, and find a book worth spending your time upon."
3,"Slow, but not as bad as they say.","This series is indeed long, and each book does move at a slow pace. But that is the idea of this series. It is trying to be detailed and somewhat believable for being set in a fictional world. This book does not have any major events happen which keeps it from staying up to par with other entries in the series."
1,Finish the Series,Jordan needs to finish this series and get back to the action! The politics were once interesting but are now boring. Finish the series the way it was started!!
1,Nothing Happens,"Like most who have bought and read Crossroads of Twilight, I've invested so much time and emotion into reading the Wheel of Time Series that I'm damned to keep reading it to the bitter end. But whereas in the past I would have recommended to friends and strangers to pick up the series, I can't do that anymore. Three of the last four books (instalments 7, 8, and 10) have pretty much sucked; book 9, Winter's Heart, reminded me why I love the series, but CoT betrayed any good-will WH had restored. I recommend not reading the Wheel of Time series until it is concluded, and there's no telling when that will be. So, gentle reader, check back in about 5 years and see where the series is. But even if it's done by then, Jordan has meandered so far afield from the heights of the series, the Wheel may not be worth the time it takes to ride."
1,The absolute worst WOT book so far...,"Robert Jordan owes me two years of waiting and $...! This series has gotten progressively worse after book 5. Crossroads of Twilight dips to new lows. I can't believe Jordan made the world wait two years for this... He makes next to no progress whatsoever in the story! The cast of characters is immense, which adds to this series early greatness, but lets be honest it begins and ends with Rand. How you can write an entire book and only dedicate 2, 2 1/2 chapters to the key character, only AFTER 500+ pages of reading about everyone and their grandmother! I am so disgusted right now with WOT, Robert Jordan, and myself for ever getting caught up in this travesty. WOT is just a cash cow now, and myself and all you other suckers are just making RJ and his publishers richer by the moment..."
1,Only slogged through the first 125 page,"So many new character. So little action. The first book captured me, as did many others. I gave this volume away to a friend who made it through 25 more pages than I did before throwing it across the room in a fit of exasperationDon't waste your time."
3,Going nowhere fast,"I need a huge flow chart to keep track of all political factions, relationships, Forsaken, Forsaken alter egos, Darkfriends, Darkfriends alter egos etc etc etc. I USED to love going through and reading all the books before the new one came out...but at Book 11 this would take me a LONG time and I don't have that kind of time to refamiliarize and remember the recent relationships, political factions etc.Time, it seems has drawn to a crawl in Jordans books. Even more so with this one as we go back in time and see how everyone reacts to what Rand did with the Source at the end of Book 10! Time is not progressing and neither is the story. No end is in sight, yet I still read because there is little else in the realm of Fanasy books worth reading.I am looking forward to the next Game of Thrones book..."
4,Great Book but a little slow,"Well, He has done it again. I have read the series twice now from book 1 to book 10. The books flow one into other very nicely. I think what most reviewers are missing here is that he needed to catch up the timelines between all the different groups(Mat, Elayne, Rand, Perrin,.... etc.) Yes this book was a little sluggish and I wish he would have tied up some loose ends that we all have been waiting for. BUT you all have to admint this man is a great writer. I only have one question...... WHAT THE [HECK] IS WITH THE GHOSTS? Any Ideas."
1,The Wheel Churns; The Creator Poops,Save your money and just wait until the next installment. Rent the book from your local library if you can't wait.
1,My sincerest thanks to all previous reviewers!,"I have peeked at this book in the bookstore and fully agree that it is NOT a ""must read"".IF I live long enough I fully intend to read all of the novels which eventually end up comprising the Wheel of Time series - BUT, SERIOUSLY (and sadly) ... Robert Jordan has finally managed to make it a chore rather than an enjoyable pastime. If ever the final installment comes out in paperback I will buy it, along with any others (after WH) that are needed to complete the set. I should be able to pick them up as cheap used copies by then. Not that I'm stingy - just that I think price should reflect value.Meanwhile, I have found some other excellent authors who focus more on writing and less on marketing. I thought I would really miss the WOT series, but it turns out that I don't."
1,Bwilf,"O.K. so after 4 books which have alienated most of his fans, news if that Robert Jordan has a new book coming out soon. And its not book 11, its a PREQUEL. Why is he writing a prequel when the series everyone is waiting for him ot finish is not finised?Two reasons come to the mind quickly. 1:He does not know how to tie up the series, just look at the last 4 books. Those books covered as much as the first book did by it selfI heard at one point that the series was suppose to be only seven books at the beginning and over time it has encrease which leads to #2:He has sold out adn is after the money.The answer is probable both, and unfortunetly I still do enjoy his writing so I will read this new book.....when it hits the library, 'casue he will not get another dime from me."
1,Give RJ a laxative,"Has there ever been a more constipated writer than Robert Jordan? Virtually zero plot movement takes place in this 672 bag of gas. If Jordan had been writing Lord of the Rings, the hobbits would still be in Rivendell in Book 10. I constantly fought the urge to skim through large sections of the book in hopes of finding some sections that wouldn't put me to sleep. What a major disappointment this series has become after such a promising start. I suspect that people keep buying it because, like me, they've invested too much time in the series not to see how it ends."
5,My daughter's favorite DVD,"My daughter is two years old and this is still her favorite DVD. She loves the songs and even tries to sing along. When she was still a baby, this DVD was the only thing she would watch and the only way I ever got a moment to shower, dress, or do the dishes. I even enjoy the music although I find myself singing the duck song at the strangest moments. I highy recommend this DVD. We have three Curious Buddies DVDs and this is definitely the best."
3,Not Bad But Could Be Better!!!,This is the first time that I'm trying a bra that closes in the front. So I don't know if they all have the same problem or not but this item isn't bad. The reason it has only gotten three stars is due to the fact that through out the day I have to keep re-hooking at least three of the hooks. Other than that it fits fairly well.
2,Answers to sample test\quizzes are not provided in book.,"I bought this book for my daughter, who is in the 10th grade, to help her prepare for taking teh PSATs. It has many good sample tests and quizes to simulate the type of questions on the PSAT. However, answers are not provided in the book to check your own answers. How are you supposed to learn whats right & wrong without knowing the correct answers.If the author gets this mesage, please email me (sercolano@home.com) a response. Is there another book that has the answers ? Without the answers the bok is worthless."
2,Not Bad But Many Errors,"...the most annoying perhaps eing the myth that Buster Keaton was illiterate. True he was not educated, but to say he was illiterate is false. I've seen photocopies of his journal he kept during WWI, and it's clear he studied his Army manuals and learned Morse code and practiced it. The author also makes the mistake of relaying to us conversations that took place between Buster and his mother-in-law, both deceased of course. How would she know what was said? These were about things Buster would have discussed with no one else. It's an intro to people unfamiliar with Buster, but by no means accurate. She could have skipped the hearsay about his early life ""with women"" as that is unfounded too."
1,A tasteless insult to a comedy great.,"Biographer Meade attempts to create controversy out of a non-controversial figure. Most laughable is Meade's claims concerning Keaton's illiteracy, in light of Keaton being paid as a writer at MGM during a 14 year period (1938-1952). A pity Meade's book couldn't be given a lower rating."
5,Sleepless in New York---A Fun Summer Read,"""Corona"" will have an all new enlighted meaning upon reading this book. It's a fast paced story about two unlikely soul mates from two different worlds, one rich and one poor. It's hard not to get caught up in the high stakes intrigue and corporate double crossings with a smooth talking scandalous manipulative scoundrel. Haven't we all met one of those we love to hate? The intrigue was there and I stayed up until 3am to see what happened--and it was worth the lack of sleep. What a great summer read because it's easy to escape into Crazy for Cornelia."
5,The Best Ever!!!,"I recently acquired this cd and i was very, very pleased. It has the sweetest, smoothest jass music ever. It is a great find for anyone who liked the movie."
3,Pimsleur German Conversational 8 Lessons,This was packed etremely well and shipped quickly. I have no problem with this seller what-so-ever. My complaint is with the software itself. Both those speaking in English and in German speak much too quickly for anyone to grasp the language. I am very disappointed in this software because I was truly hoping to learn German quickly as this software company claims it works. I'm still going to give it a try anyway but I'm sure it will take a lenghtly period of time to to so.
3,"Great, but you won't fool anyone","This is an excellent starting point, but even if you gain a passable native accent, they won't believe you're native. This is high German and most Germans will be offended if talked down to. Some of the words aren't correct either. It is very easy to follow and it isn't overwhelming to study with. The pronunciation is off from what I learned; my teacher was from Germany, his second language was english and first was German. Overall this will get you through the cities of Germany but not the countryside or Köln. I recommend this as a great first step, but I suggest looking for a German penpal to help you keep up with the latest trends(and to correct any mistakes in grammar you pick up from this) in the language so you can really sound like a native."
3,great parody of the family that refuses to go away!!,"I am NOT a fan of the TV show but the movie reminded me of just how dumb and nerdy the Bradys were. I loved Mr. Dittmeyer and how he was trying to put their house up for auction. The guy who played Doug Simpson was alright with his ""french kiss"" he planted on Marcia. Then lets talk about the appearances of Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Henderson, Ann B. Davis, and Barry Williams. This kid who played Greg was much better looking than Barry and his Johnny Bravo was so lame it was histerical!"
3,The Brady Bunch Movie,"I grew up watching the Brady Bunch and was so excited to find it on Amazon, I however did not know or understand what ""Region 2"" meant.... meaning it is from the UK and doesn't play on our Blue Rays. It does however play on my lap top which I can connect to my TV. The movie was here when you said it would be and I love the Brady's!!"
3,"great footage, but lacks commentary","There is great documentary, movie, and news footage in this film, however, the lack of commentary is frustrating. I was expecting something that would give more of the history of the period, rather than just showing footage. The lack of narration left me questioning the history and context of the footage being shown. Narration, or even captions, would have been effective. The footage that is shown, however, is excellent and would probably be much appreciated by someone who is familiar with this time period."
2,Not for elementary level,"I am a 6th grade teacher. After reading ""Bud, Not Buddy"", and learning a lot of background of the Great Depression, I thought this movie would be good to wrap up the unit. For 6th graders (and below) they really couldn't follow along with the format of the film. Some events were familiar, but all in all, they were a bit bored due to being lost. The film itself is great. But not for elementary aged students."
1,Order big!,"I like a little bagginess in my shorts, so I ordered these in a larger size than I usually wear. Apparently, I didn't go large enough. I literally own pants supposedly two sizes smaller than these, and they fit me fine. These should have been quite big on me - and I can't even get the zipper up half way. I'm not returning them because, for what I paid and what I'd have to pay to ship them back, I just don't think it's worth it. I don't recommend purchasing shorts from this company unless you can try them on - I certainly won't be buying from them again. I feel like I got ripped off."
3,sizes run small,sizes seem to run 1 to 1 1/2 sizes smaller than advertise so......order a size larger than you normally wear!over all they seem like very nice shorts!I sent them back and I have yet to ordered another pair!
1,Dickies are made of good material... Just not enough material.,"I have never had a problem ordering clothes online but these shorts are ridiculous. They are a full four and a half inches narrower than advertised, which goes way beyond what is acceptable for a clothing company. Now I know that some clothing companies tend to ""trim"" the patterns a little short and I shouldn't expect anything less from this particular company, however, I am actually insulted that dickies gets away with such a high level of cheap, scammy bull%#^*."
5,Short Khaki in navy.,The cut is almost like Khakis only they stop just below the knee on me.Two side pockets are pretty big and don't bulge if you carry a lot of stuff like I do. Looks nicer than cargo shorts and has almost as much capacity.
4,"Liked the song,,,","The remix (extedned version) is really good if you like this song,,,,especially at the price,,,"
1,Poorly written,"The book entitled ""The Illustrated Man"" bye Ray Bradbury, in my view is poorly written. I dislike Mr. Bradbury's repetitive repetitive repetitive style. I also found that Mr. Bradbury did not consistantly stick to one form of language; often he would insert a brief British chiche."
4,The Illustrated Man,"The short stories, for the most part, in this book, are engaging and very interesting. Towards the middle of the book 2 or 3 stories were a bit stale, compared to the rest; but the majority of stories were excellent and engaging reads"
2,Illustrated Man review,"The Illustrated Man was not a interesting book to read. It never appealed to me. Maybe I am biased because I never liked science-fiction, but not only that, this book was the pinnacle of confusion. I had to read a story from the book twice just to get the point of a story.Even though i disliked this book, I did like quotes from the book. My favorite quote of this book is, ""More than food or a woman or amything, I just want Earth."" This quote shows that people need Earth. Living on Earth is blessing and people don't know that.Despite me not liking the book, this book should be read. You learn many things from the book. It had many points and can be used to teach many things in life. Although this book had good points, it did not have thing that captivates you to read a book. It took be a month to read this because the book was not interesting."
4,A review on The Illustrated Man,"The Illustraded was a good book, and reminded me of Farenheit 451. Which was also a good book that Ray Bradbury wrote. The book is mostly about space, time-travel and robots. It was exciting and also boring at times. Overall I think he could have made some of the stories a bit more excitng."
4,Best required reading I ever done,"This book is fabulous! Never since my early childhood did a book influence my life. I enjoyed the wide variety of main characters, each with their own faults and virtues. It was very easy to link these characters to my own life and catch a glimpse of what obstacles may be in my future. Also, I like the fact that it was easy and imaginative. Most of the stories contain a twist that kept me in suspense until the very end. Those complaining about lenght have nothing to fear because the words are easy so reading long paragraphs can even take under a minute to complete.I recommend this novel for required reading because this novel contains many purposeful themes. Unfortunately, I cannot put my favorite meaningful quote here because it spoils a story but it changed my life! I saw how miserable a man became and I realized that the way he led his life is almost like mine; I did not want to share his depressing fate."
2,Disappointed,"I was under the impression that this book would give you ideas on how to help kids deal with their anger as well as identifing what causes their anger, but instead its a workbook with no help or suggestions...for that reason I am giving a 2 star rating...other than that..it came quickly and was in great condition.."
5,Excellent Compilation,"This double CD has everything and more. Sure everybody knows about I'm A Believer, Daydream Believer, Steppin' Stone, etc... but the real good stuff on these CD's are the songs that the casual fan has probably never heard. Take a listen and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,Great music!!!,Great band...great easy listening Hawaiian music! I enjoyed the great rythms of the guitar and steel guitar. I loved the Hokule'a Hula...very hard to find single.
5,wonderful product,"i take this supplement at least once a day. i had alot of urinary problems, so i needed a pill to take daily. great product, fast shipping"
5,Kids love Thomas,My 3 kids love all thomas and this introduces them to some new ones and that is very helpful for their memory in rememoring all those names.
2,"Cute, but not for the absentminded","Perfect size for me, cheery to look at, pours very well, but developed rust spots on the interior during the first week: not good. Worse, this kettle has no whistle, and when I absentmindedly let it boil dry one day, part of the handle melted. They say it is heat-resistant plastic, but it decidedly isn't. If you can't keep an eagle eye on it, get something else."
5,AWESOME SONGS - AWESOME ARTIST,If you have not went out and bought MAN LIKE ME by Bobby Pinson your missing out. What an awesome debut album. This is my favorite CD of all time and I listen to it all the time. Bobby Pinson will go very far in Country Music!
5,"Country, with raw soul","I was first introduced to Bobby Pinson when his song Don't Ask Me How I Know made it into the country charts. Great song, but not enough to get me to buy a full CD. Then I saw him live at a Ten Man Jam session in Houston about three years ago. Whoa...he blew away the house with a really soulful version of Man Like Me. I bought everything he had out at the time, and Man Like Me is still in my car's CD player three years later - it never gets rotated out of the mix. He writes his own music with incredible clarity, insight, humor, and honesty, and delivers it in a gritty, soulful, ""this is who I am and this is where I've been"" way. Lot of pain, lot of growth, lot of hope and gratitude. Such is life, spelled out in a way that touches the listener to the core. Buy anything you can find of his. He's now co-writing with Toby Keith (She Never Cried in Front of Me) and co-wrote Sugarland's All I Wanna Do, but hearing Bobby sing his own works is a stellar experience."
4,Wow. . .,"If half the things Bobby Pinson sings about actually happened to him, he is a living country song. Listening to him sing I have to believe he has lived this life he sings about. His rugged voice and feeling lyrics (he wrote most of the songs) really should take him far."
2,Very disappointing,"One would have thought that with a good script , very good actors and a story based on real life that this film would be entertaining . I sat and watched and kept waiting for it to get better . It was like the whole thing had been put together very well and all the gaps were there for the laughs , but I wasn't laughing .I would recommend you rent this film first .I bought it second hand and had sold it within a week .It did not even have the quirky appeal of a cult film .I felt sorry for those involved and I hope being associated with it doesn't hurt their careers too much .I hope you feel differently to me ."
5,an interesting perspective,"Hardesty presents a clear, Christian-based argument in this book. It helps to reevaluate one's stance on certain issues, while all the while strengthening faith and ideals. A very relevant book in today's struggles to make liturgy accurate and unbiased."
3,Send me to South Dekota!,"This collection of s/m stories, mostly dealing with spanking and the like, cannot fail to please those interested in this slice of ""kink."" They are imaginative, well written, with believable characters (well, most of them!) and give explicit details: the vary heart-throb of erotic fiction. This is a book well worth reading, and re-reading."
4,Great Movie,Great story set in the old west. Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett do a great job. Recommend to old west story lovers.
2,missing missed,"Having had high hopes and expectations for this movie, I was sadly disapointed when an outstanding director and cast joins a story line that sounded quite good and it combines to be below average. It isn't 2 hours of my life that I won't get back, but it didn't match its ingredients."
5,Absolutely Fabulous! And underrated!,"The most underrated movie of the year! Just wonderful. Exciting old western tale and moving story of a kidnapped girl. I have to read the book now. Really enjoyable movie! Tommy Lee Jones was fantastic, Cate Blanchett was powerful and moving, the girl who played Lily was great, and Jenna Boyd was superb in her role as the little girl."
3,The Missing...,"I thought this movie would be great when I went to the video store to rent it. It is good, not great. For one thing it is way to long to keep you interested for 2hrs 17min. The only movie that can are Lord of the Rings and The Matrix. The ending to the missing is very good and the story is good too. I just think Ron Howard could have made it a bit shorter. If The Missing were shorter, say 1hr 45min, I would have given it 4 stars."
2,Sub-par,"It's only a testament to how good a director Ron Howard is that I write to express my disappointment in this really slow-moving film.It just never really seems to come together on any level. Howard's films are traditionally extremely character driven and I was shocked when that seemed to be the movie's main failing. What drove Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones's characters were just never really explored. It wasn't for lack of time either, clocking in at over two hours, the film was far too long.I don't want to give the wrong impression either; it certainly wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It's more that when Howard's on we get movies like Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. I was really disappointed that, by the bar he set for himself, this film is WAY below his ability. At over twenty dollars I couldn't possibly recommend buying a copy"
4,Cate Blanchett at her best,"For a Cowboy/Indian type movie this was great. You have a mother (Kate) estranged from her father (gone-Indian-Tommy Lee Jones) bonding together to find the evil Indian (kidnapper of young girls to sell on the Mexican market) in search of the oldest daughter now a kidnap victim herself. Lots of action, very good acting and a great female presence of Evan Rachel Wood Jenna Boyd, playing the daughters of Cate Blanchet and Granddaughters of Tommy Lee Jones."
1,Completely disappointing,"When you read the back of the DVD to find out the plot, please remember that what is written is misleading. I watched the movie expecting some sort of demon as the evil in the movie. However, I was wrong. Very wrong. The ""evil"" they find in this movie is not what you'd think of when you think supernatural. Also, this is not Tommy Lee Jones best acting. :( Although, I was fairly impressed with Cate Blanchett as a pioneer woman in New Mexico. But...you have been warned."
4,Good to see Once...I think,"If you are considering seeing this movie, I would recommend it. I enjoyed it and I am not really a fan of Westerns. I don't know if I would add this movies to my DVD collection,but it is definately worth seeing at least once."
3,Boring!,"Kelsey didn't have two brain cells to rub together evidenced by the fact that she intentionally involved herself in dangerous situations. She also acted like she was above everyone else and refused to believe that a friend she'd had little contact with for years could have ""changed"". There was virtually no character development and the romance was not at all convincing. What was the whole story behind St. Augustine and what happened between Kelsey and Dane after her brother's death? There were also pages of useless dialogue, who cares about an involved discussion of where to go to dinner. Again, boring!!"
3,Disappointed,"I became a fan of Heather Graham after reading ""Picture Me Dead"" and have been ordering/reading her other books. Just finished ""Hurricane Bay"" and have to say I was disappointed. There is no sexual chemistry between Dane and Kelsey, as there was in PMD. The mystery isn't much of a mystery and the characters seem shallow and undefined, even immature at times. Ms. Graham is a good writer, one I usually love to read. I hope this one was a fluke."
1,Simply a nuisance,"I found this book really disappointing, it never really worked for me. Sure, it's got some nice description of the Keys and the minor characters and their bickering are lively and sometimes amusing but that doesn't redeem this novel. I couldn't care less about the protagonists - Kelsey and Dane never came to life for me and their romance was far from convincing. The plot line is extremely weak and deeply flawed (a serial killer and a copy cat in the same small circle?), the actions of the hero - allegedly an experienced P.I. - border on stupidity and the overly self-confident heroine just stumbles from one danger into another..."
2,What are you thinking?,"I was thinking ""looks great!"" I want a heater that has oil filled. ""It has a timer great!"" But the timer is not the ""I want it on for 2 hours then turn it off kind"" it's the ""I want it on between this hour and that hour every day"" kind. A foot peddle On/Off. Wonderfull I don't have to bend down. Did you notice the thing has wheels? Easy to transport, moves even whial you are trying to turn it on. I say trying because I have to step on it 3 or 4 times to get it to, turn on, change modes, to turn off. This is the second we send the first one back because the foot peddle on/off didn't work at all. I might buy another heater from Deonghi, but not this model. What are you thincking?"
1,broken on arrival!,"I ordered this from Amazon and received it in about 2 days. Unfortunately the foot pedal is broken, so I have to return it. My other DeLonghi has lasted for about 20 years, so I will get a different model."
4,interesting cookbook,"I gave this cookbook to someone as a gift. The recipient loves Northern Exposure. I browsed through it and found the recipes to be very unique. I thought this could be a gift for someone who loves to cook, not just someone who loves Northern Exposure."
4,Excellent book on Sputnik,This is the first book I've seen to disclose that the Soviets invited US participation in their satellite program before the first Sputnik was launched. Its a very solid piece of both technical and social history.
2,Everything but Sputnik,"If you're looking for a careful analysis of the development of Sputnik and its implications for Russian space science, skip this book. Most if not all the information in ""Sputnik"" can be found in better books such as Korolev (James Hafford), the Rocket and the Reich (Michael J. Neufeld) and This New Ocean (Willian E Burrows). If you're looking for a lengthy, whiny collection of how Americans felt about Sputnik and what they were doing on October 1957, Sputnik is the book for you."
2,Emmanuelle Collection,"Somehow, I received the Korean version, where all the liner notes are in Korean and the English on the box is misspelled and grammatically incorrect. Had I known I would have received the Korean version, I would not have bought it."
2,"middle "" western"" music..........","I just listened and in fact bought this cd ..I am originally from Middle East but I really did not like this cd..Because first of all this is not real middle eastern music..this is almost middle western!! music..I love and listen to middle eastern music a lot but with this album I could not find the taste of middle eastern music...where is ""darbuka"" at this cd??if you want some real ,authentic middle eastern music go listen to Burhan Ocal from Turkey...Arabandi from israel...Hossam Remzi from Egypt..the thing is it is not so easy to blend real ethnic music with modern jazz or dance...Most bands or single musicians fail to do that..One of the few who manages to create something valuable is Dj Cheb Sabbah .."
2,Sounds like video game music,"This sounds like music that gets played while playing Tomb Raider. The tracks were non-inspiring and annoying, though on some openings they did catch my ear."
4,Wow!,"Leann is came back with the first single from her new album, Whatever We Wanna. Ms. Rimes chose to release her latest collection of songs in Europe as opposed to the U.S. because they are more receptive to the poppy side of Country's reigning princess. ""And It Feels Like"" is her best song to date, in my opinion, providing us with maturity both vocally and musically. The Friday Night Posse remix is truly captivating as Hi-NRG is not a direction I would picture this song going. I wasn't too impressed of the mix for ""I Need You"", but the video for ""And It Feels Like"" is so enthralling, it almost is worth the cost of the single alone."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book thinking that it would show me not only nice pictures, but also information about the villages it supposedly considers the most beautiful ones in Provence. Pure disappointment... Even though the quality of the pictures is nice, they do not give you a true view of the relevant villages. They are pictures taken at random that do not represent - sometimes - the best view of the village.But what is most dissapoiting in this book is the poor information about the villages, its populations, culture and location. In my opinion, every descrition of each village should also contain a map of its location in southern France (for us to know how could one get there), its population (to see how big it is), a some info on the villages picturesque points, etc. The few paragraphs dedicated to each village are too vague.Finally, I think the editor should have made this book differently with half the villages and twice the pictures and info about them. I gave 2 stars for the pictures."
1,Wait for Cardwell to publish,"This has to be one of the poorest written and edited books on trading. It starts early with an error in the equation for RSI (not to worry, the appendix that goes into more detail also has at least one error in the spreadsheet). The charts need a magnifying glass to read. But even a magnifying glass won't help in finding points that are referred to in the text, but not marked on the chart. I guess we'll have to wait for Cardwell to finally publish."
5,Not One Recipe Has Gone Wrong!,"I've had this book for a few years and just love it. The Eggplant Rolls with Ham are fabulous and so is the Macaroni with Smoked Mozzarella Sauce, and so is the mushroom and potato soup, but last night I made the Risotto with smoked ham and fennel and everyone LOVED it! Also, I made the peach cream with mascarpone and amaretti and it is so wonderful I had to whip up a second batch today! BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Poor design,"My prior B&D; can opener was simple and easy to work. This new one requires much more involvement with placing cans properpy and hold down the lever to keep it working, and the cutting blade pops out easily.Give me back my old model."
3,Attractive and useful,"Not as good a product as the old spacemaker it replaced. More plastic parts and motor not as stong. Looks great tho and so far has done the job. If the unit is not mounted flush vertically with the cabinets, the handle will hit the top of the cabinet."
5,Spacemaker Can Opener,I am very pleased with my purchase and the timely manner it was delivered. It met all my expectations and I would definitely order from this company again.
3,OK,Bought this to replace an old black and decker under the cabinet opener.We couldn't use the same holes we had to drill new ones. I doesn't close up like the older one. It doesn't open cans as nicely. It leaves quite a jagged edge on the cans so you have to be cafeful. I have not had any problem with it opening cans and it works on any size. I wish B & D would have kept with something closer in style to the old design. It would have been nice not to have to drill more holes in the underside of my kitchen cabinets.
5,Just GREAT,"This book is absolutely amazing. It is a must for everybody who wishes to live in harmony with his/her own personality as well as with friends, coworkers, neighbours, relatives etc. I highly recommend it! Steffen"
2,Pedantic but Useful,"The Happiest Baby on the Block is something that I read while pregnant to get tips on what to do once the crying begins. I hear from girlfriends that this advice is actually excellent, so rather than just watch the video, I decided to read the book. Maybe not actually a great choice...The author comes across as pedantic and arrogant. I choose to believe that he has reason to feel so strongly about his miraculous calming skills (that's why he has written the book and started the 5 S's movement, after all, right?!), but found it hard to read, precisely because of this style. I am sure the advice will turn out to be right on, however, and I appreciated the in-depth look at why babies cry and how different cultures handle their infants. The video is probably sufficient, however!"
4,Helpful advice for baby's -- but NOT for toddlers,"Dr. Karp's 5 S's were quite helpful in soothing our son. So yes, I recommend this book. I DO NOT however recommend his similarly titled book for toddlers! His expertise clearly stays in the realm of infants.Buy this book, but don't waste your money on the second. I guess he and/or his publisher assumed (and were probably right) that most people would automatically buy both books since they seem to 'go together' ... sadly, the advice in the second is nowhere near helpful (unless of course you think it's acceptable to lock your child in his/her room, teach them bad habits like gossiping, and lie to them so they learn not to trust you! All of which is part of the ""advice"" he provides.) Sad, but true."
2,Old News,"I thought a lot of the information in this book is now written about in magazines and websites. I already knew about the S's and the 4th ""trimester."" If you read magazines and websites you probably already know this info also!"
5,The 5 S's really work!,"Dr. Karp's advice has completely changed our fussy infant into a much calmer and happier infant. Consequently we feel better about our parenting skills and we are so thrilled to help our son. As new parents we were at a loss to help calm our son. The constant screaming even after being rested, fed and changed was extremely difficult to tolerate. We read so many books and tried so many suggestions. Dr. Karp's 4 S's allowed us to turn on our baby's calming reflex immediately. Our son sleeps longer and much more peacefully. I highly recommend purchasing the video to see how to apply the method and the book for practical parenting advice. Our life has completely changed because of Dr. Karp. If you have a fussy or colicky baby you would be a fool not to purchase The Happiest Baby On The Block."
5,Excellent book & DVD,"I am an Early Childhood Specialist and I present workshops for childcare providers and parents. One of the biggest complaints of people in childcare is that they just cannot get some infants to stop crying and it disrupts the entire setting. What to do? Enter Dr. Karp and his wonderful techniques. The book is so helpful for parents or providers to have at their fingertips and the DVD amazes them. People are fascinated by the 4th Trimester Theory and the truth about colic. Those who are still doubtful are sold by the time they witness the techniques firsthand. The workshops I give using Dr. Karp's materials are always full of new people. The stress level in a child care setting immediately drops when an infant is soothed by the 5 Ss. Wonderful for parents, even better for childcare providers who work with infants."
5,A MUST READ FOR NEW AND EXPECTING PARENTS!,"This book is absolutely awesome! It helps new parents calm a crying baby in the first several months of the baby's life. It tells you how to calm a crying baby and how to get a baby to sleep. Unfortunately we got the book after three or four months, but it still worked great. It's too bad we didn't get it earlier, so we wouldn't have missed all that sleep!I would reccomend this book to all expectant parents. It will certainly help with the first months of your baby's life."
3,nothing new,"I read the book and watched the video. I thought this would be a lifesaver but honestly it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Swaddle the baby, shush in their ear, gently vibrate/rock... don't expect miracles but some of the tips help."
4,Informative,"A very informative book. A bit repetitive at times, but he really drills into you the basics of how to soothe your baby. We bought this book before baby was born, since we wanted to have some soothing techniques ready for use. Turns out our baby fairly laid back, but occasionally we found the 5 ""S's"" useful, although we didn't need to do them in the order he recommends, or even all at the same time.Was very useful for new parents.Filled with a lot of great stories, a few theories, and some fun writing. He makes very clear these are just his theories, but he lays out a lot of evidence about why he feels this way."
3,"Great Ideas, but your better off renting the video","While I applaud Dr. Karp's system and approach for ""The Fourth Trimester"", this book could be written as a short pamphlet. It repeats itself over and over and over and...over.The techniques themselves are great, however. My 3-month old is happily swaddled to sleep and sleeps better for it."
5,AWESOME,"I could write a long review about this, but it would say the same thing that everyone else said. It worked magic for our extremely high need baby. And those comments about it being redundant... Well, I find that helpful b/c it really really explains his methods thoroughly so that you can fully understand the and do them correctly."
3,Borrow this from the library.,"I read this book when my first child was about 4-5 months old. And it was a little too late for the baby. I read it again right before my second child was born, and it really worked well. My husband was amazed how fast I could calm our second baby. He thought this baby was just easy to calm until he tried his own way. I think if you follow the 5S's from this book, your first three months with your baby will be much easier and pleasant.However, I didn't think it contained much information other than the 5S's. It kind of feels like he tried to stretch out the simple concept into a hundred-whatever-pages long book. I would recommend reading it and making it yours, but borrow it from the library."
5,AWESOME!!!!! Baby self help,"Great for the baby's first 4 months of life ... technique is easy and there are MANY examples of combinations of stuff to soothe your baby. This plus the ""Babywise"" book *Schedule only* was amazing for my son!!!!"
2,There are much better books on the subject,"Dr. Karp's book wasn't very helpful for us, it is also unnecessary lengthy, full of repetitions, and stories that are of little help. I wish I didn't buy his book, but bought Marc Weissbluth's ""Your fussy baby"" instead. I am reading Weissbluth's book now and find it so much more informative and interesting, fullof interesting up to date research information and recommendations on how to deal with crying and sleeping problems in babies."
4,Worth It but Wordy,"This is an excellent book. The idea of the fourth trimester is genius and we have a very well adjusted happy baby because of the ideas in this book, with that said the book could be much shorter than it is. It is poorly written and states the same ideas over and over. We found we skimmed the important ideas rather than reading word for word."
5,great ideas and techniques,"One of the nurses in the hospital suggested this book to me, and my husband and I picked it up when our son was about a month old and getting increasingly fussy at night. Some of it is common sense, but it's nice to be reminded. Other ideas are things we hadn't considered.As with anything, it's just advice--you don't have to do 100% of it to make it work for you. Our baby didn't like full swaddling, but we figured out that it helped to wrap his legs and let him have his arms free. He never took a pacifier, but it would get to the point at night where I couldn't breastfeed him anymore because he was clearly full... my husband would let our baby suck on his finger for just a few minutes. (The finger thing didn't even occur to us before.) Have a little common sense when you follow the suggestions and see what works for your baby."
5,pediatricians in private practice,Dr. Karp is a wonderful pediatrician and his recommendations will help fussy babies and their parents adjust to life!! His techniques work remarkably well. We and our patients thank you.
1,Didn't work with us.,"One of the 5 steps in this book is swaddling, and my baby HATES this since he was born... so this book was useless for me."
4,Excellent,Excellent book! Gives you the information you need to keep you precious bundle of joy happy. Would recommend to anyone having a baby :)
2,some useful advice but full of clichés and too long,"Pro:The book offers useful advice about how to calm your baby.Cons:It is very repetitive and contains a lot of filler pages. The whole thing could (and should) be summarized in about 20 concise pages rather than waste the precious hours of tired new parents with irrelevant case stories.Also, the advice in the book is wrapped in a pseudo-anthropological narrative that fuses dubious speculation about human evolution with highly racialized clichés about child-rearing in non-Western societies. In short, the book contributes to the romantic (and racist) myth that non-Western societies are better at dealing with babies because they are supposedly more in touch with ""nature"". The corollary of that argument is of course that non-Western societies are stereotyped as backward and primitive."
4,sleepless in ny,"this is one of the many books i bought about sleeping problems and i found this book, to the point and very helpful."
3,"Don't need to buy it, just read the charts in the middle",My sister gave me this book when I had twins. I read the entire book and decided the two middle pages- summary information and the diagram on swaddling did not need another 200 pages of explanation. Valuable and useful advice- but way too long.
1,Too little information.,"I consider this book as a waste of money. The book can be shrinked into 5 pages, including several common sense."
2,Common sense,"Why everyone is so jazzed about this book I will never understand. If you simple listen to what your instincts are telling you than you really don't need this book. Here's a good idea, intead of wasting your time reading 300 pages of common sense, get up and cuddle your baby."
4,Great Baby Book,"This book is such a wonderful help when you are trying to figure out what to do with a fussy baby. I recommend it all the time, especially to first time parents."
4,Entrepreneur As the Mainspring....,"Dr. Powell has done an excellent job of presenting the entrepreneur as a messianic figure for economies vast and various, allthewhile framing the fellow in various ideal situations - no undue government interference, no fog to obscure the golden opportunities, no big business bully competitors. A different title or more examples and actual statistics of successful entrepreneurial mainsprings would have added bite to the bark. Overall a very interesting report with various tidbits about the tax policies of Hong Kong, Chile, the Pacific Rim and LDC's(Lesser Developed Countries)"
5,Bound to keep you on the edge of your seat,"An ex-con (Gina Gershon) and a gangster's girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) have a steamy affair and hatch a plot to steal $2 million from the Mafia in this tightly plotted thriller from the Wachowski brothers. Of course, their scheme doesn't go as planned, resulting in a dizzying series of surprising developments and reversals that kept me guessing right up until the end. Most of the action takes place in two neighboring apartments, but the Wachowski's way of shooting familiar objects from unexpected angles keeps the action from seeming claustrophobic. Joe Pantoliano excels as the mid-level Mafioso Ceasar, a desperate man who proves to be less predictable than the two schemers expect. This film is particularly impressive because it is the Wachowskis's first feature."
2,Cliched and overrated,"The movie was mildly sexy and a bit clever, but overall I found it to be cliched and pat. The last line of the movie, which epitomized the tone of comformity that existed throughout the movie to be a ""good dyke"" was frustratingly corny and an insult to my intelligence. I mean, please!"
1,No Updates,"I contacted Mio the first day I received this as a present in 2007. I still have the problem number and it, is still on there website when I log in. No updates for the maps. Every time I drive home from work it wants me to go down a dead end street. Then it thinks every road is dirt and will not take me down the shortest route.I contacted them on there website, called and e-mailed and no help? I will never purchase a Mio again."
3,Has Potential,"We are still learning how to use the Mio. The biggest problem with all of these seems to be the lack of updated maps. My brother purchased a Garmin for much more money and has the same problems. We have lived in our house for nearly two years, and there were houses here when we moved in, however, the TeleAtlas maps don't even have our streets on them. Navigating around the confusing Dallas area, though, has been made easier by the Mio, though there are times it wants us to go through neighborhoods we would rather avoid. There may be a way to get around this, but like I said, we are still discovering some of the abilities of the machine. Overall, we are happy with our purchase."
4,Accurate GPS,This Mio is very simple to use and great for navigating unfamiliar areas. It is very accurate and the maps are extremely reliable. The voice commands are also very accurate and helpful in the city. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to acquire a satellite signal but once it does your on your way. Batter life could be better but is nothing really to complain about.
1,Don't throw away your paper maps!,"I bought this in July 2007 for a trip from Wisconsin west to Yellowstone and Glacier. It failed to do its primary job - consistently getting us to where we wanted to go. Sometimes it did and sometimes it didn't. There were times when we chose a listed POI, saw signs to it, and followed the signs instead of the Mio, which was telling us to go somewhere else. When we got to the POI, the Mio still didn't know it, and kept telling us to go elsewhere. This was not an isolated incident, and I've had similar problems in Wisconsin. I haven't tried to use it for the past few months. I can understand it taking you on a less efficient route occasionally, but if you can't be sure you'll really end up where you want to go, what good is it?"
3,No Favortes,"In terms of GPS functionality-- this unit works fine. It has a pretty good display, navigation works well, etc.However, I had to return this unit becuase you can't store address as ""favorites"" like many other GPS units (including my older NEXTAR C3). You can store ""home"" and ""work"" - that's it. (and while these two 'favorites' can be renamed-- two just doesn't cut it for me).ALso, while you can review and retrieve an address from a ""history"" of recently-travelled destinations, these will scroll off eventually and then those addresses have to be re-entered.Too bad-- a really important feature that was left out, and a deal-killer for me. Wish I had known beforehand.If that doesn't bother YOU-- then I do actually still recommend this GPS-- the price is sure right."
3,Mio C220,"I like the product. It help to navagative to places that I am unfimilar with. Three issues I have with the the product are short battery life, the lack of a training manual that help one use functions, also has you attempt to turn on streets that do not go through, or sends you through a section of town full of stops when a bypass would be more effecient to destination. Price was right and picture and voice is good.shipping was easy to track. Arrived when it said it would."
4,Good..Not exact route calculation..,"I bought this product after seeing the reviews. This product is providing route direction well in advance. So by the time you go exit/turn, it will tell you another route. It is not prodving exact route at exact time."
1,Awful - prepare to get lost,"I owned this priceless gem for approximately two days. In those two days, I was sent in circles, sent down dead-end roads, sent to the wrong destination, and left helpless by Windows CE crashes. The base maps are wrong on many many things (at least in my area) and the routing algorithms have you drive miles out of your way just to turn around and have you return to the same intersection."
1,Please do not buy this unit!,The Mio C220 is possibly the worst unit on the market from its lackluster mapping software (it is useful if you know where you are going it will lead you to a POI) to its very short battery life. If you must buy this unit keep in mind Mio itself does not have excellent support (none in fact in CONUS) and the extended warranty does not include the mapping disc (maps are not imbedded into the software of the unit).It also does not include a co axel cable to recharge the unit or download the CD ($24 from Radio Shack).You are definitely getting what you pay for with this unit and I assure you that the most satisfying moment it brought me was smashing it while talking to the warranty people who told me that the software was MIO's problem. Mio said to talk to the warranty people.
4,Better than most,These cable chains offer maximum clearance between the cables and the car body. They are easier to install than others I've used because you don't have to drive over them. I would have given them 5 stars but there is still the same old hassle of getting enough slack in the chains to fasten that last connector.
5,Cable Chains Great,"I used these cable chains on a trip to Washington State in December, 06.They were easy to put on the tires and easy to remove. They rolled up in the original carrying case after use and are awaiting future use.I like them.Dennis Orr"
3,It goes on easy but then it doesn't....,"I got this for my wife. I wanted something that was simple to put on that she could do on her own. Putting the actual chains on was no problem but the tensioner is where it all falls apart. The thing is so tight that there is no way she can attach all 6 points. I emailed SCC and asked them if there is a minimum number just in case 6 was hopefully overkill. Nope, they said all 6 have to be attached. So you have been warned, these things require some muscle to put on properly."
5,Great value through Amazon,"Was able to make sure with .pdf that I was buying the correct cables for my tire size, Prompt delivery allowed for double check installation & they went on pretty easy & now I am ready for the snow & I guess the ice too."
5,Excellent,"Excellent fit. We did need to use them. Excellent arrival time. We needed the chains for our weekend trip in Big Bear, CA, mountains. We had an express ship and it got here just as promised."
4,Great Product,"Chains work very well. Trust me. Practice before you need them!!!Once you know how, they are very easy to install. Might want to pack a drop cloth and your own work gloves, especially to remove. You will get very wet and dirty.Chains store nicely and have definately gotten my little sedan out of trouble more than once."
4,"Works great in the snow, but had to get it replaced.","The chains worked extremely well the few times that I used it heading to South Lake Tahoe during the '09 season. Provided a great amount of traction under heavy snow. However, one of the chains broke off (must have just been a defective link). I sent it back 2 months ago for a replacement and a brand new one was shipped last week with no problems. Easy to put on and take off. SZ127 was a perfect fit for a 195/60R15 2004 Honda Civic. Would have received five stars but had to ship this back at my cost!"
4,snow cable/chains,"Nice product, well made. I first saw the cable type chains over 20 years ago while in Washington state, they worked real well. My only complaint with these is that they are not as easy to install as you might expect, and it is not mentioned that they are not intended for use at speeds over 30 MPH. I bought them mainly to get in my long uphill driveway , while the roads are cleared pretty quickly, the drive way stays icey and snow covered long after the public roads are clear, so either put them on and off, or drive real slow on the road."
4,Works excellent on BMW e46 330i,"I use these on my rear wheel drive BMW 330i which has very little clearance. These are very easy to use, but only after you figure out how to use them. Combined with snow tires (stock summer tires are worthless, chains or no chains) I am able to drive you all but the worst mountain conditions Tahoe with ease.The instructions that come from SCC assume you can reach behind the tire, which you can't given the limited clearance. So you will have to move the car, but it's far easier to reach the inside latch when it's on the bottom/side instead of inside the wheel well.1.) Fasten the outside fastener that is opposite the silver colored bottom fastener for the inside2.) Hang cables over top such that the open latches are on the bottom of the tire3.) Move car forward quarter wheel turn4.) Fasten inside fastener which you can reach from the rear, then 3rd (last remaining) outside fastener5.) Mount tensioner and drive away"
5,Like it so far,"Easy to install on 2012 Honda Odyssey (inside the garage).Haven't used it in snow yet. But, like it so far."
2,SIZING CHART IS USELESS,POOR SIZING CHART RESULTED IN TOO LARGE OF A CABLE SET. I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THE DESIGN OR QUALITY. YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH STANDARD STYLE TIRE CABLES.
2,fell off within 10 minutes,"I actually like the product, buy my chains fell off withing 10 minutes and caused over $1500 of damage to my Honda Pilot. I bought the right size, but they seemed too loose and the terrible sound of my bumper getting sliced was my confirmation.I would still use the product if I felt they fit better, but for right now, I feel stuck."
1,Another nail in the coffin for Burt Reynolds career,"OH BOY. YOU KNOW A MOVIE IS IN TROUBLE WHEN YOUR ALREADY LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH WITHIN 20 MINUTES. A BAD CAST, POOR DIRECTION AND A SLEEP WALKING PERFORMANCE BY BURT REYNOLDS MADE THIS EASILY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS OF 1988. NEXT TIME, RENT A WRITER..........."
5,Wonderful !!!,I got this cd a few weeks ago and I literally listen to it every day. There are so many song on this cd that are both emotional and fun loving. Tim McGraw is a terrific performer. I love his music!!!
2,Songs not as good...,"I'm not sure if Tim McGraw is looking to get away from his ""regular"" style of songs, but I found that this album was not as good as former albums of his. ""Live Like You Were Dying"" is the standout song on the album, but there were other songs that were a bit quirky such as ""Drugs or Jesus"" and ""Do you want Fries With that."" However, McGraw can be commended for keeping the ""twang in country."""
1,ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF BUBBLE GUM THEY CALL COUNTRY!,"THIS IS PURE BUBBLEGUM...NOT COUNTRY! I'M SICK OF THESE IMAGE PRODUCED HAT ACTS AND ANOREXIC FEMALES WHO APPEAL TO THE MASSES AND CALL THEMSELVES COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT COUNTRY! MCGRAW, HILL, MCBRIDE, MCENTIRE, AND ALL THE REST WILL NOT MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF ME BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE RECORDING IS POP BUBBLEGUM....AND THIS CD IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF IT. JUST LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES. OH HOW I LONG FOR THE DAYS WHEN COUNTRY MUSIC WAS REAL, SIMPLE AND TRUE. ALAS, THOSE DAYS ARE GONE AND I FEAR WILL NEVER COME AGAIN THANKS TO PEOPLE LIKE TIM MCGRAW."
5,"Differnet Sound from the past, but definitely grows on you","When I bought this CD, I was a little suprised at first. I was expecting the same catchy upbeat tunes that I have grown to love. I love the title track, makes you really pay attention to what is important in life. About two years ago, I lost both my parents (within 5 months of each other). The title song really emphasized the realizations that I have had in the past two years.After that, the rest of the CD is just alot of enjoyable music. Seems to be more reflective than other CDs, but well worth a listen. I got hooked. One of my favorites is also ""everybody Hates Me""."
1,Go Back to Country Songs,"I heard this album at a friends house, and I did not like it. I think Tim McGraw has a great country voice! But he should think about going back to singing country songs. I liked his first and second album, and those are the albums I own. The other seven albums have to much of a pop sound. When I listen to counrty music that is exactly what I want to hear.So, If the music industry and Tim reads these reveiws then listen up. Go back to country songs!"
2,not her best work,"I had read tripoint, and so bought this book since I had liked the other one. I found chernevog to be virtually unreadable. Perhaps that is why it is out of print, even though she is a popular author. It was boring, and really didnt make much sense. Once in a while it seemes she had a potential plot, or the seeming villian might get interesting, but the she ababndons even that. Skip this one, try tripoint, or stuff in that world."
2,Poor plot and character development,"Characters come and go without making much of an impression or advancing the plot. The most intense part of the story - a chance sexual encounter in a lesbian bar - occurs in the third chapter. The reader should really dislike the bad guys and root for the good guys. There is an evil boss, but he's a cartoon character - utterly predictable, speaking dreadful dialogue. He gets his due ""off stage"" and not at the hands of our hero. The author invested little in the way of defining the bomber's actions, motivations, or pathology. The protagonist's love interests are neurotic, controlling women. This odd treatment - no definition of the antognist, pathological characters supporting the protagonist - left this reader with no sympathy for the hero or the outcome of the book. Rather than write an ending, the protagonist falls unconscious and it remains for minor characters to finish the story."
4,Equestrian,This is a pretty easy game. Not fast moving. I would compare it to a car racing game where you can build your cars and open new tracks.
3,Action And Adventure,"The action in this story was exceptional but uneven. The first part is packed with fast paced, riveting scenes and the ending is also exciting. But there was a long and tedious portion in the middle of the book concerning relationships and business deals. The characters were an interesting mix. Those aboard the tug, Warlock, were fresh and original. Others were somewhat transparent and predictable. I realize that the character of Duncan Alexander needed to be exaggerated for dramatic effect, but his extreme stupidity only made him less believable, in my opinion. Still, a very worthwhile read, especially for aficionados of ships and seafaring adventures."
4,Talented author,Will Smith books are always good. Some better than others. This one is not as good as some of his others but really worth reading.
3,"Sea, ships, crude oil and human greed","The head of Christy Marine, Duncan Alexander, plans to build the largest tanker ever designed, the Golden Dawn. He signs a ten-year contract to carry one million ton loads of crude oil from the El Barras field on the south Arabian Gulf to the Orient Amex refinery in Galveston, Texas. The problem is that the design of Golden Dawn is far from flawless and that the El Barras crude has a cadmium sulphite constituent of between 2000 and 40000 parts per million. There has probably never been a more deadly cargo in the history of seafaring. In spite of Nicholas Berg's persistent efforts, nothing can stop Duncan Alexander. The Golden Dawn is about to undertake her voyage from the Arabian Gulf around Good Hope, one of the most dangerous seas of the world with a cargo that could wipe out virtually every creature living in the sea..."
1,Too Technical,"This storyline is so technical about the running a tug to rescue a disabled ocean liner that I had to give up 27% through the book. Paragraph after paragraph went into such detail about cables, machines, motors, etc. that the storyline was lost. Too bad because I really like Wilbur Smith. Very disappointed."
5,"You might not agree with everything in the book, but it's a deep well of wisdom","This is such an interesting read and the relevance and deep wisdom is evident on every page. Although it was written hundreds of years ago, there is so much to learn about human nature, politics and life and the author is relatively clear in his thoughts. I'm not sure what type of reader would find this book interesting but it's historical importance and general political nature makes it relevant to any study of mankind."
5,Great read,"Great Book, if you would like to understand the fundamental concepts that were created to govern the world we live in today."
2,Sometimes Age Matters,"This is disapointing. Its sad to see your heroes age. Of course aging is no sin, and of course inevitable, yet seeing and hearing the weak vocals dirge-like tempos and generally lackluster performance underscores the sad reality. There is no spark and no joy in this concert, and the songs, the new ones are feeble. The old warhorses, just, depressing. Trower attempts to breathe some life but ultimately it all falls dreadfully flat. A real drag man."
4,Rendell does it yet again,"Her previous Wexford novel 'Road Rage' was always going to be hard to follow, but once again Ruth Rendell has demonstrated why she has been dubbed the modern 'Queen of Crime'. 'Harm Done' broaches the subjects of paedophilia, domestic violence and abduction, managing to be as addictive as it is disturbing. In the end is left to the reader to decide whether the end result of the major crime is justified by the means - and the novel is as suspenseful as ever. Wexford continues to delight, and it is difficult to imagine Rendell ever writing a less than superb thriller. Right out of the top drawer - in other words, a normal day at the office for Ruth Rendell."
1,Terrible,"I had never read one of Ruth Rendell's works before, and based on this one, I probably never will again. I thought her book was infinitely boring, the plot developed so slowly it was like watching paint dry. In addition the characters were two-dimensional, and Rendell's (too) many plot lines were disjointed, the abduction of the two girls having absolutely nothing to do with her main theme of domestic abuse. The only reason I kept reading was that I expected it, or hoped that it would get better. Needless to say I was sorely disappointed."
2,Long winded,"My first Ruth Rendell novel, listened to on CD. The reading is very good, but the novel is longwinded and relatively boring. Between spousal abuse, bigotry, low life prejudice and multiple police cases, Rendell has taken on way too much here and done a satisfactory job of little. What stands out and suprised me most, tho, is her portrait of the British provincial police as small-minded and not particularly bright. A strange sort of detective fiction that left me wondering if she is really mocking the police. Part of what makes for the longwindedness is how many obviously false leads the police conjur up in long discussions, that then have to be played out in visits to imagined suspects.One thing about some of the reviews. It strikes me that those who complain about her ""political correctness"" ought to quit whining and just come out and say they think spousal abuse, lynch mobs bigotry, etc., are unworthy subjects for policiers (and other types of fiction?)."
2,Tedious and slow,"I read all the available Wexfords and most of the other Rendells years ago and I thought I'd go back and catch up on the stuff she'd written since then. Ugh, was this one a stinker. Not a person in the book is interesting enough to keep you reading and the pace is slow, circular and monotonously unenthralling. The author's notion of ""casting a cold eye, on life, on death"" is simply to disapprove of everyone, their housekeeping, their child-rearing and their lifestyles. And social outrage -- nomatter how sympathetic -- does not human interest make. Dull."
5,A Must Read,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for writing this book!!! I have found this to be the best book I've read concerning Lyme Disease. As a Lyme patient, I found it to be extremely helpful to read what other patients have experienced. I saw myself in each one. It was also helpful for my family as well."
5,Confronting Lyme Disease--a must have book,I bought 2 of these books so I can share them as much as possible to make more people aware of the many different ways this illness can affect people.
3,"Confronting Lyme Disease, Other peoples stories","A collection of short stories and traditional medical treatments. Reading for entertainment. Choose this book if you find comfort in other peoples problems or want to know if your symptoms could be lyme disease. Not very well written, more a collection of chart notes. If you need ideas on where to turn next, you may want to read this book. If you are well informed about lyme disease you will find this book a waste of time."
2,Not meant for connecting PC monitors to TVs,"I bought this product so that I could connect my computer monitor to my 46"" HD TV in order to watch youtube, netflix, and downloaded videos on my TV. However, after receiving the item, I found out that I need another $70 PC to TV converter in order to accomplish this. While this was doable, the product is rather large and unwieldly compared to similarly priced products. I am returning this item and buying a Western Digital TV Live Plus instead, which is smaller, runs for a similar price, and does everything I wanted this product to do."
4,Great for Direct TV,"I use this for the garage. I don't need to rent another box, I have the transmitter on our bedroom box that no one used during the day."
5,Great product!,"It took me just 10 min to set it up and this product works like a charm! My source TV (1F) and receiving TV (2F) are about 50 ft apart, and the receiving TV shows very clear picture without any distortion. The remote control works just fine as well. This is one of the best products I have ever purchased!"
4,Good system,Much better than lower frequency sysstem I previously had. Very sensitive to pointing angle. Had to adjust it several times to eliminate intermittent interference. No problem with microwave operating in close proximity.
4,OK quality but not as good as direct wired TV,"Transmitter and receiver Works fine. I can control my cable DVR box from another room through the infrared link at the recieve end. Great feature because it gives me full control of my DVR, VCR, DVD, and Stereo from the bathroom, 3 rooms away!The little mini dish antennas dont have to be perfectly aimed to work.I get no interference from other devices such as telephones, WI FI, etc.The picture quality on my remote TV is not as good as a direct wire to the cable box would be and my TV is HD LCD. Picture is quite acceptable though so I am happy. Just don't expect a full knock you dead HD pic!So for a remote room TV this is a great device but I wouldnt use it for the primary 56"" HD home theatre experience!I have had it on continously for several weeks with no problems.The best part is it saved having to do a major re-wire in my house to get cable into the bathroom. A re-wire would have cost more to do also so i am a happy camper."
4,Works Great!,"I use this to transmit a tv signal to an out building about 100 feet from the main house. Picture quality is great, sound quality is great, works well with a couple of caveats: (1) transmitter and/or receiver should be near a window (more walls = weaker signal); (2) the remote control feature is very finicky (it is easily blocked). Otherwise, I highly recommend."
3,Might be a good product,"Had a noise problem with the transmission. Never figured out what was causing it. Turned off every device in my home that could have a noise effect on this transmitter (phones, pc's, etc.) to no avail. So, I had to return it. To be fair the picture was extremely crisp/clear, if it wasn't for the rolling white noise bars."
4,Great over short distances,"We purchased this to replace an older 900 MHz transmitter / receiver that had poor picture quality and suffered interference with microwave oven. This unit's picture and sound quality is quite good, and is free from interference. Our application range is about 25 feet, separated by a stone wall, but I suspect signal path is through a doorway between the units. We do have occasional signal interference when we walk directly in front of the receiving unit, although this is not significant problem."
1,Disappointing,"Considering all of the positive reviews, maybe I just got a lemon. I have a similar 2.4GHz version that I bought years ago at Radio Shack. It has great reception, but it is also very susceptible to interference. I bought this thinking it would be an upgrade since it touted greater range and little or no interference. It may not be getting any interference, but the signal/reception is terrible. Nowhere near as good as the older 2.4GHz unit, sitting in the exact same place with the same antenna orientation. Sending it back."
2,Not ready for primetime,Picture is clear but for the lines that roll up the screen. Hey maybe my home but moved room to room and tried different setups but never resolved issue. LOL even tried powering off other devices incase they were interfering to no avail.Would not recommend to friend
1,This product might be faulty by design,"Getting it out of the box and pluggin'it is a breeze and works wonderful but only for a limited time. After a few days, it becomes completely inoperable, and useless. The problem is that one can not know if the problem is the receiver or the transmitter or the cables. However, I noticed the receiver getting very hot while the transmitter is just warm to the touch. I have returned two of them because of the same problem. There must be something wrong inside that deteriorates after a few days of use or may be due to the overheating of the receiver."
1,Did not Work.,Interference with my 5.8 GHZ phone and remote control would not work. I returned the product.
1,Did not meet ANY expectations,"Very very disappointed w/ this item. First, the set up instructions are awful. The instructions go as far as plugging it in. There is nothing about channel or remote set up. Second, both the box and the Amazon description suggest that the signal can penetrate walls. It cannot. The paperwork included with this pitiful item says, ""...try to minimize obstacles (e.g. TV or other electornics, large furniture) where between the transmitter and receiver."" In addition to poor editing of the document, one wonders, would you not consider a wall an obstacle. Regardless, this is a waste of time and money. I am returning my order."
4,"Works Great, but doesn't last very long","I bought a set of these to avoid running coax cable around the house. They work well with a direct line of sight and through frame walls, but not brick walls. Unfortunately they only last about a year. My first set lasted six months and were replaced under warranty. The second set lasted about a eighteen months, by turning them off when not in use."
4,Works Great Except for Vertical Hold Problem,"For the most part, this product works great. I used to have a Leapfrog 2.4GHz sender that experienced unbearable interference from my neighbor's wireless router. This product solved the interference problem, and most of the time the video/sound quality is great. However it seems that a small percentage of users (myself included) experience a vertical scrolling (v-hold) issue. This problem only seems to occur with certain TV's. I have a 14 inch Toshiba. I hooked the receiver up to a different TV and did not experience this problem. The vertical scrolling occurs consistently over certain types of video (someone hypothesized that it was bright video that caused the problem). I will try using a modulator as I hear that this will eliminate the problem."
2,Annoying interference,"I use this device to relay audio and video from my surveillance system in the basement to the TV in my family room. Don't use it often and it serves it's purpose, but it's nowhere near as good as a physical A/V cable. The receiver and transmitter are only 30 feet apart (transmitting through walls and floor - but certainly in the stated range) and I get very annoying, intermittent static that would really prevent me from using this with any kind of continuous use like watching television or a movie. Switching channels doesn't help. I can't tell if it's a defect or interference but I am likely returning it."
2,Subject to interference,"This product worked as advertised except for a very loud burst of noise and blacking out of TV picture at random intervals, several times in an evening. I tried all four channels with the same result. This problem could have been with the product and not interference. The company did not respond to a description of this problem via their email."
2,Lame,"Amnesia is the most overused plot device in popular fiction. One would hope that a writer who dares to use it would at least back it up with a decent plot, but in this book, no such luck."
2,My son doesn't like it,"My son LOVES books but has no interest in this book - NONE. I probably read 30+ books a day to him. At 12 months he can sit through average length books (e.g. Brown Bear Brown Bear, What Do You See?) and some longer length books (e.g. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom - his favorite). He won't even sit through the first half of this book and it's relatively short. I don't understand what people see in this book. The black & white pages are very dull and the objects that are mentioned in the book are so small I have to look for them. Neither the illustrations nor the wording hold a young child's attention. There are so many other nighttime books that are more appealing to young children. Save your money and space on your bookshelf."
4,5-star for the children,"My opinion should matter very little here. What's important is that young kids absolutely love this book. All 3 of my sons loved this during the 1.5 to 3 years of age range. It's a great book for them to wind down in the evening. They love spotting the moon, the kittens, and whispering the word ""hush.""It's easily memorized (as an adult reader). The illustrations are adequate, but the flow of words just does not do it for me. It's not something I would pick up to read for a child, but when they start clamoring ""moon, moon,"" there can be only one response. Yes, you read it to them again (and again...and again...).I do recommend it, but don't expect to personally love it, like I do with other books (like the Spot books)."
5,A Classic for a Reason,"Good Night Moon is a simple bedtime book that is perfect for sharing with little ones ages six months to three years. It begins by naming various items found in a little bunny's ""Great Green Room,"" and then goes on to say good night to each one of them.Reading Good Night Moon nightly is not only a lovely bedtime ritual, but also a great way to begin building a vocabulary for a little one. My children also enjoyed looking for the little white mouse in the illustrations. Trying to remember where the mouse was on each page was a great memory booster. I believe that this classic bedtime book should be on the bookshelf of every nursery."
4,Good bedtime book,"This is a pretty good bedtime book because it exudes a very mellow mood. Some of the illustrations are also quite nice and children are drawn to some of the images - the moon, fire, mouse, etc. I personally find the book a bit boring and overrated, but my kids seem to like it fairly well, and as I said, it's a good book in terms of being relaxing before bedtime."
1,"Classic does not mean boring, does it?","This book is boring and the graphics are terrible. Why the black, white, and grey? It could be much better if the pictures weren't so terrible."
3,Goodgye Moon,"I was expecting the board book and got the paper version instead. It came quickly but was the incorrect item. I did not return it because i could make do, but I was disappointed."
2,Just for very little children...,"Thinking on my seven years old child, I bought this book. When I received the book, I found it very simple; it has no more then 10 words per page and my son finished it very quickly. It is not a bad book, but it is very simple."
5,great seller + great product,great sellerHe refunded my total cost etc because he could send it too fast. I am sorry for the seller.
5,Still reading it....,"My daughter and I read this every night...and we have been doing so since she was a few months old. Start your own bedtime ritual with this classic. Goodnight stars, goodnight moon...and goodnight baby."
5,My daughter's favorite,"Clearly this was my daughter's favorite as evidenced by her requesting this nightly read for 4 months in a row. Further evidence of the quality is that I actually enjoyed reading it to her for 121 consecutive nights.Fun story, great illustrations, catchy and precise prose, sturdy board book, all composed to a gradual winding down that has my daughter sleepy and ready for bed when we finish.What more can you ask for in a bed time book?"
1,Don't see the point,"I hate to disagree with everyone else that raves about this book, but... I don't see the allure to this book. My son found it acceptable, but nothing special. I didn't enjoy the cadence, premise, and it made no sense to me at all."
3,Great book,"Book was a little more ""used"" than described, back two pages were all but completely ruined and peeled apart, you can barely see the pictures...."
5,A book that is read at least 8 to 10 times a day!,Our child has us read this book to him so many times in a day that it has been worn out to the point that a second purchase is nessessary. The words just flow from page to page keeping his interest. The contrast from black and white to the color pages keeps him searching for the items that are read. This book is a must for any parent!
2,Why is this book a classic? I don't get it.,"Our eighteen month old has long ago shelved this book, and I must say I support his ""decision."" I guess its okay for a bedtime book, but there is no plot, the illustrations are uninspired, and it fails to engage the little ones I've read it to. We got it as a gift, but certainly would pick other books to give as gifts to others."
5,I absolutly love this book and I am 12!!!!,When I was real little I recieved Goodnight Moon for a present. I loved it! I still do. Great book for any age.
3,Goodnight Moon book & bunny review,"My only complaint with the product is that the size of the stuffed animal was a little deceiving. It is much smaller than I anticipated. Otherwise, it's a great product!"
5,A Classic.,"I have 2 daughters, one 6, the other 18 months. This book has been in top rotation since the birth of our first. What a classic.Goodnight Moon is a great combination of art work and story, and should be on every new parents ""must buy"" list. Our family has most likely read this book together over 200 times."
3,Goodnight Moon,Was disappointed when I looked at the book and it was just a little tattered around some of the edges!
5,Worth It,We have many copies of this book around the house. Our son is 22 months and has loved this book since we started reading it to him. He loves finding the mouse that moves around the pages and pointing out the different items we say goodnight too.Well worth it
5,"Goodnight, Moon","Every child should have this book...I love it, as do my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
5,Goodnight Moon,This is one of the all time favorites to add to your children's library. It is an especially great selection to read to children at bedtime. A wonderful selection for children having difficulty going to sleep at night.
5,Great goodnight book!,"Good pictures, good rhymes, mellow tone -- works as a great goodnight book. It's one of our kids' favorite book ... they said ""moon"" as one of their first words when pointing to the book. Most of the words are easy for them to say, and there are a lot of colors inside that they can point out as well. You won't go wrong purchasing this book."
5,Best bedtime story ever,"I got this book from friends several years back and thought then that it was cute, but now that I have a one year old son I think it is GREAT! My son absolutely adores this book and we have to read it to him every evening before he goes to bed. He also carries it around with him during the day (first thing he picks off the shelf in his room), and it seems to give him a great sense of comfort.Personally, I love the way the book is set up with the repetition of the same motifs and the gradual darkening of the room. So clever! The repetitiveness also is great for fostering cognitive development. My son now recognizes a few items in the book and points them out as I read it to him.I can't wait for the moment when we can together say goodnight to all the different objects in his room at the end of the day. What a great way to end a child's day and help him get comfortable in his room and ready for the night."
5,A magical story that soothes a little soul.,"A bedtime story that wraps a child in comfort and security. From the subtle changes in the darkening room to the soft repeated whispers of goodnight this book is a must for any child you love. Ann Clarke, author ofPeople Are So Different!based on tolerance and understanding."
3,"It was okay, I guess.","Can't say that either my 16-month old daughter or I were ever that keen on this book. The pictures never caught my daughter's eye and there are other books with much better rhymes. I got a much better reaction from my daughter with books by Eric Caryle, Dr. Seuss, Sandra Boynton, Richard Scarry, and Karen Katz. She often comes to me carrying a book by one of these other authors so I could read it to her, but she's never voluntarily picked up this one."
5,A must have book for any baby on your shopping list!,"My husband and I read this book to our 15 month old son every night before bedtime. My son loves the book so much that I now have to get a new copy for him to ""love on."" Get it for the next baby shower you attend!!"
5,Masterpiece.,Read this to your young children. It's an absolutely perfectly simple book. No extra fluff....just a great read for you and your children. I read this every night to my daughter with hush little baby. She has grown to love the moon and is sparked with excitement for nighttime viewings of stars and the moon. Education starts early. Reading is SO important. Take advantage of this classic read. They will remember it for years.
1,Amazed this book got so many good reviews,My daughter and I were not impressed with this book. The grey pages were boring and the figures too small. Saying goodnight to everything in the room can be done quite easily without this book.
1,"SOO BORING,GREY & WHITE PICS-GOODBYE MONEY!!!","This book is not visually stimulating nor is there any real prose. VERRRRRY BORING and non sensical in a way that doesn't entertain like a Dr Seuss would. So disappointing after reading all the good reviews...if you really must throw away your money, send it my way."
3,Video Tape Version!,"I don't have the DVD. I'm reviewing the video tape put out by Goodtimes Home Video, it contains the pilot movie that started the television program Little House on The Prairie is one of my favorite shows. This Goodtimes tape is okay but kind of grainy and not of the best quality. Complete seasons of Little House on the Prairie have been put on DVD and I had thought of getting them but I read complaints that they aren't the complete episodes as they originally aired on NBC in the 1970's but taken from the syndication TV edits and if that is true I'm very disappointed. Can someone say if that rumour is true or if some bozo just made up a lie that thy aren't the complete episodes?"
5,Excellent viewing,The chemestry on LHOTP was evident in this first show. Was great to see this classic again. The dvd doesn't have any extras.
4,one of the jams back in the day,this was one of the jams back in the day. Teddy riley doing production with the new jack swing grooves and Big daddy kane bringing the flow. Kane was the truth back in the day on the mic. this cut still bangs.
3,Works well,"I bought these combs for my mother's Oster Groom Master clippers. The smallest comb does not work with the Groom Master because the comb interferes with the clipper head. The only difficulty we have is removing the combs...you must slide the comb forward to remove it and the spring will pull it back quickly, so watch your fingers!! Overall happy with the combs."
4,Mo' better music,Flic has appeared on cable in a cycle lately and I became interested in the music expecially the title track - the musicians are excellent
4,GOOD DISC,I Dug The Soundtrack better than the film.The Music Sounds Good Through out.if the film had have just focused on The Music it would have been Incredible.The Musicianship is Solid Here.
3,union street,very interesting novel which explores the living standards of middle class women. I found the life of each woman very exciting. I am studying this novel as part of my coursework and would be happy to hear anybodys view on this book
2,Warped,"I purchased this to replace a well used board which became so warped and distorted that it made chopping and cutting difficult, I was pleased to finally get it replaced. I tossed the new one in the dishwasher (as recommended on the packaging) for an initial cleaning only to retrieve a warped board following a normal dishwashing cycle. Not too happy, and will likely have to replace it as I continue to wash it in the dishwasher. I would purchase a thicker board if you plan on washing it in the dishwasher."
4,a delightful read,"this work of art is truly worth the read. each page is a charming delight.its a must read,especially for its price."
2,The product title indicates to include two books but I only received one,"Love the author but disappointed in the distributor. I didnt receive both books. They returned my email and said they would either refund my entire order if I returned the one book or reimburse me $5. Neither option really satisfied so I will probably just be more carefully not to order from this distributor again. Amazon is awesome and I probably could have complained but with new babies and bigger fish to fry, I decided just to let it go."
5,Much used consumer reference,"This book has enabled me to read just about any ingredients list and understand it fairly well, and I have changed some purchasing habits for the better because of it."
4,Interesting story; not an easy read,"I bought the book due to my interest in the period it covers -- early Alpine mountaineering. Edward Whymper was an interesting guy, and certainly one of the foreign pioneers of mountain climbing (including the first climb of Matterhorn). I found him to be less inspiring as an author -- the book's pace is slow, punctuated by various tangential discussions, e.g. geology of glaciers.It failed to capture my imagination, as other more receint mountaineering books have done -- try Gaston Rebuffat, Walter Bonatti, Chris Bonnington instead."
1,Piece of junk,"This device seems to be cool, but it is really useless. Very low power, noisy, and requires you to install lots of ""audio files"" for programming the stations. These audio files send data to the transmitter and reprograms it to the desired FM frequency you want to tune in your car. What happens is that if you put your device on shuffle mode, you do the math... Workaround is to delete these audio files, but you then lose the capability of tuning to a different frequency, in case you travel.There are other devices (Monster is great) that do the job seamlessly. Besides, this device is dedicated to the iPod mini and will not work on any other model. Other devices do a much better job in this case, especially the ones that use the universal iPod connector to interact with the iPod."
4,Comes out swingin,"This is a really good cd Trillville they have some great mc skills but hands down my fav part of this album is lil scrappy I was just floored His lyrical skill reminds me of when I first heard outkast in the fact that it was just mind blowing skill. If I liked it so much then why did I give it 4 stars Im sure your asking? well its a little heavy on skits, Other then that great album cant wait to see both sides trillville and lil scrappy put out sophmore albums"
3,Not so much,"I thought this book would be more than what it was. The information is great, and really well researced, but the book itself isnt so hot. No color pictures, not enough pictures, and just really bland. I got it for a good price but that is really all I got out of it."
2,Read Aloud Bible Stories,I really did not like this book and did not give it to my grandchildren. I will donate it but it was not at all like I thought it would be. Very infantile!
5,Excellent Resource,"Ms. Lindvall does an excellent job of relaying classic Bible stories in a manner that is poignant, yet developmentally appropriate for young minds. It is evident that she has taken the utmost care and reverence in adapting the text. The beautiful illustrations by H. Kent Puckett accompany the stories in a captivating, powerful way. There are few enough words per page, and the illustrations are so well done, that the combination makes this series an excellent resource for sharing the Bible with children, while at the same time, maintaining their attention long enough to deliver the Message. Each book includes 5 Bible Stories from both the Old and New Testaments. Stories include those such as that of Creation, Joseph and His Coat, Jesus Stills the Storm, and Noah and the Ark. I use all four in the set in both my preschool and pre-kindergarten classrooms. The children love listening to the stories, as well as picking up the books and perusing them on their own during free time."
4,Option Magazine Review,"Crommie's musical timespan stretches from the middle ages right through a digital sampler into 1990. He plays instruments as diverse as the recorder, the psaltery, the synth, and the dulcimer, and creates gorgeous compositions which utilize medieval sounds alloyed with a new age aesthetic. Your first comparison might be to Mark Isham's music, although Crommie is more delicate - he doesn't go in for Isham's grandiloquence. Crommie's sythesizers are subtle, creating a sort of dreamy context which allows the acoustic instruments' voices plenty of room. If you're into medieval music, you may hear it in a new light on this tape. And if your taste runs to new age, this is a must, a distinct cut above the audio anesthesia you hear from the larger new age labels these days. John Baxter, OPTION."
5,The book is the answer...last system you will ever need!!!!,"First off I have to say that if you are spending hundreds of $$$ on supplements to try to get huge or build muscle you are about to save a lot of cash.

4,Talk About A Good Book,"I would strongly recommend this book to other aspiring writers. The writing is excellent and although I found myself questioning Regina's troubled past, the story was written well enough for me to keep reading. I read it in a matter of days and wouldn't hesitate to read one of Mrs. Cleage's other novels."
5,Great sleeping bag for the entire family,"We found these to be very comfortable. We bought the double bag because it was our first camping trip with our 2 kids & it matched our tent. Both my son, 7 years old & daughter 4 years old never sleep in their own beds when we are away from home so we thought it wise to buy these for our trip. My daughter slept with me & my son snuggled with his Dad. The pillows are a bit small but they were comfortable enough. These bags are not good if you are backpacking since they are rather big but they are ideal when you drive up to you campsite."
5,Great Music,This CD has a lot of great songs on it and the singers are very good! It doesn't sound like a bunch of amateurs or kids singing.
3,Saw the movie,"I saw the movie and thought the book would be a good read. While I appreciate the classic talent of the writer, I could not read this book due the ""density"" of the prose."
2,Disappointed with Updike's tale.,"There is often a lure to read a book that is the basis of a new movie, and that call has led to reading some outstanding works of fiction. I usually read the book first and often end up skipping the movie. ""Oil!"" however was a complete disappointment. The broad strokes of the book are engaging and the first third is inviting with dynamic characters in an urgent Southern California environment. And then nothing interesting happens from there... It becomes a poorly told story of a privileged young man's growing disdain for capitalism. If you read the book after seeing the film - you will be disappointed. Kasey Cotulla"
4,Excellent Debut Release!,"Albert Cummings debut release shows a truckload of promise. His guitar playing sizzles but is restrained and not over the top and his vocals are pleasant and easy listening. Cummings release is mostly original with two covers, Willie Dixon's ""Hoochie Coochie"", Robert Johnson's ""Crossroads"" and the blues standard, ""Mojo Working"" all performed very well. To me, the original material works much better for Cummings than tunes like ""Crossroads"" which have been done time and again by blues musicians everywhere. That is a small knock for this otherwise fine disc. Best tracks, ""The Long Way"" and ""Lonely Bed"", both original, slow to medium tempo, excellent guitar and strong vocals."
4,"This is the DVD, not the computer game",The other reviewer accidently reviewed the computer game here (which I understand to be terrible). This is the DVD version which is recommended instead of the computer game.
5,War,This book is amazing. Good read with great detail. A must read. Very detailed and shows what would happen if Lee took Gettysburg
1,Why Gingrich is a subversive right wing hypocrit,New Gingrich is a subversive hypocrit. His works should be sold with an asterisk that reminds people this man has worked his entire life to undermine freddom and liberty in this country. He is a right wing hypocrite that no publisher should publish. He should be exiled to Siberia . We do not need individuals like GIngrich in this country.
2,Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War,"This book is an alternative to the true story of Gettysburg. It well written, but it is so far off from the true history of Gettysburg that I found it annoying, even offensive in light of the true events of July 1863.To me history, although it can be told and often explained very well in fictionalized stories (Killer Angels for one) should not be so changed as to taint the reality of what occurred. Especially when using the names of those who were part of the actual event."
1,(Not so) Hidden Agenda,"Forget this book. If you want an alternative Gettysburg, read Harry Turtledove's ""Guns of the South"" instead."
1,Not a book,This is 3 pages long because the pictures are not included. Not worth the time to download or review or delete
3,Medium Isn't Always Medium...,"T-Shirts are an interesting thing. Depending on the brand and the type within that brand, some are too wide, slim, short, long, etc. I'm a slim-medium frame and about 5' 9"". This shirt fits me fine around the chest and shoulders but barely covers my belt line. It's still wearable but not the most comfortable thing."
3,Barely OK,The material is indeed pretty heavy so it would be a good t-shirt or under-garment in cold weather. But the 2 shirts I bought both shrunk probably close to half a size and the arm holes are too wide and I don't have skinny arms.
2,poor quality connection between top of stand and post,Not well made -- hardware was stripped after a few uses and my husband had to bodge a fix for it. Stand still tilts and dumped music unexpectedly. Look elsewhere.
4,Good for creative children,"When I was little (a long time ago at this point!) I had this book and was utterly fascinated by it. I remember trying to dye yarn myself after reading it... (well, that didn't work out so well as I recall-- since this is NOT a how-to book, just an engaging story-- but it was fun all the same.) Now that I'm an adult, I would definately recommend this book to anyone with ""creative"" children who love to make things."
5,Wonderful book that I've kept for thirty years now,"My grandmother gave me this book in nineteen-seventy-something and I have hung onto it until now. The original copy is still with me, I cherish it and I read it to my two older children who are ages six and four. Lovely story, fascinating, nice illustrations... Thumbs up!"
5,Finally..a book for adult orphans!,"Highly recommend this book..through tears I read it - sometimes many pages at a time, sometimes I could only manage a few, but through it all I kept thinking ""yes, yes, YES!"" This book and those who were generous enough to share their own experiences with losing both parents have helped me more in the past few days then anything has in the last year. I don't feel so alone, strange or isolated now - no longer confused as to why I am experiencing some of the emotions, feelings and thoughts I have. I am still accepting that life has changed, in ways that no one, until they walk the path of both parents lost, will understand. The book has given me hope,reassurance and brought comfort to the sharper edges of my grief. Thank you, Ms. Brooks and the others who helped bring this book to fruition."
2,"Too much product, not enough info.","I purchaced this drive for two reasons. I needed an external writing drive for my laptop, and I wanted to transfer VHS tapes to DVD. As an external drive, it seems to be a solid, well-built(although slightly costly) drive. I was very disappointed at it's ability to transfer VHS to DVD though. After installing the software and reading the manual, I found out that I needed to buy an additional video capture card. The really big problem there is that most cards on the market transfer analog video on your internal drive, making the external writer completely unnecessary. My advice would be to only buy this as a primary writing drive, of which there are equally good and less expensive models out there. If I had to do it over, that would have been my course."
2,Painful,"I'm really trying to make it work with this burner. After hours and hours of attempted DVD-R burning with the 4x model and 10+ chat's with Iomega support, the support team realized the problem might be my drive. I received the 8x model as a replacement and am having similar problems burning. I know it is not a machine specific problem since a TDK external drive burns no problem. I would never wish the amount of time I have wasted troubleshooting and $$'s spent on failed DVD-R burns on anyone."
1,WATCH OUT!!! BEWARE!!!,"This device was a major bust!!! Will NOT properly transfer any format data,music,video from a Win98SE to blanks then to WinXP MC2004 computer. Crashes computer and the included CD/DVD software willNOT work properly. Sonic CinePlayer froze computer up and would not load. Installation software changed config.sys/ regedit/autoecec files to its own parameter and rendered my internal cr-rom drive inoperable. After 7 hours on non-toll free repair line with Iomega got that working but Sonic tech support could NOT fix freeze problem so I had to return it for full refund. Iomega is a piece of junk and its 3rd party software sucks!! Sabve your money go Sony or LaCie d2!!"
1,prentice hall grammar and compositon,"I recently signed my son up for a out of school class called a ""correspondece"" course, and he seems to be having trouble in it. I was wondering if you guys could find the teachers edition with the answers in it because we all know I sure don't know them. Jk Anyways thanks. My email is playdoe70@netscape.net"
4,"Good practice, but nuances can be missed",This is a good set of CD's for beginners except for the fact that the narrator fails to point out the differences for verbs between male and female.
5,Love this book,Just got this book last week and I cannot wait to try to make some of the stuff in it.These ladies are pretty creative and I have enjoyed reading and paging through the book!
2,Curb Shopping or Just Plain Junk?,"I have to admit there are a few nice ideas in this book but there isn't anything you couldn't have found on the internet. I was expecting some blow-by-blow instructions for ""repurposing"" rummage sale or curb shopping finds. Instead it was more a book on musings about being a trash to treasure kind of gal. I was disappointed and not just because I don't have a penchant for ball fringe either. I recommend that you check this out at your local library before committing to a purchase to see if it is the right T2T type of book for you."
5,Finest book on the subject I've ever seen.,"This Freemasonry book is one of those MUST READS that mystical students should have in their libraries. Filled to the brim with perceptions on the rites that just don't exist in other books, the author clearly shows he is more than just a writer, but someone with TRUE spiritual insight. This book should be required reading for candidates into modern Masonry"
3,Title is a bit misleading,"I do not believe that this book represents what our Craft will be like in the 21st century. Nonetheless, the writer is certainly free to interpret the allegory and symbolism as he sees fit. I would not recommend this book to the newly initiated ( except in the Lodges that consist predominantly of Eastern thought, New Age followers, etc.) I would, however, recommend it to serious students of the Craft who are interested in seeing how Freemasonry is ""instructive to all, and offensive to none."" For those who enjoyed this book, take a look at ""The Meaning of Masonry ; W. L. Wilmhurst."" I appreciate Bradley sharing his views as much as I enjoy the books by Mackey et.al. who take a different approach to the Craft."
2,very hard to understand,It is almost like a book for someone into the new age movement. I felt more like I was reading a book on astrology or other new age sciences than I was on Masonry. It does have several informative moments though.
2,Just another New Age spin on Masonry,"Not very much to this book except an author who embeds his ""New Age"" opinions and philosophies in and out of existing masonry. In laymens terms ""it is kind of like buying a monopoly game, introducing or changing a couple of rules and moves, then repackaging it with a slightly different name"".The author studied under Torkum Saraydarian for a while before achieving his self appointed spiritual mastery of New Age nothingness. He has migrated his studies to UFO's as last we heard. That should be enough for anyone.GC"
1,Don't waste your time or money...,"PU. All that talent, a significant budget, a perfect story, and incredible characters cannot overcome this utterly wasted effort in bringing Lewis Carroll's beloved tale to the screen. Disregarding all media issues such as sound and image quality, the slap-dash editing alone is enough to make one nauseated. Don't waste your time (even if you're rotting in prison) or your money (even if someone offers to pay you to view it) on this disaster."
1,Alice in Wonderland...,"So I saw this one live action Alice in Wonderland movie and it sucked!!!! But I'm confused this isn't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie, I think it is. I'm not sure if I want to risk boring myself with other crap... so will I watch this verison ever... who knows"
4,Good songs and entertaining,"The cute toddlers, animals, colorful puppets, and catchy songs kept my 3 yr old entertained. This DVD is worth it."
1,"Pretty thin - a waste of time, I have to say.","A short review: I agree with the other 1 star reviews. Luckily, I saw it on TV."
2,okay movie,"It wasn't the worst movie that I have ever seen but it was not the best movie either. It was really stupid. It had a lot of funny parts to it but overall, it was not a family movie. And even if they were not aiming for a family movie it still was not the best. They had some really good actors. They had a good plot and it was original ideas in there. But I think where they messed up is they had too many themes going on at once. If they would have stucki to the idea of hiring a homeless man to help them play pranks on the bullies it would have been better. But, I could get through the movie, it started off funny but I just wish they would have put more time and ideas in the movie and it would have really been a movie you could keep and watch over and over."
2,Too much cussing by the young kids.,Funny show that really had no need for the all the cussing. There is enough derogatory speech in real life and is not needed to make a show more entertaining.
3,"Ok for rent it, not buy it.","The first time I see this movie I liked, that's why I buy it.But was not so funny if we considered that the bulling problemdoes not have a happing ending in real life."
3,Great Book,"I am writing this review today to tell you my point of view towards this story written by Ernesto Quinonez. Even though I am Chinese, I still found this book to be enjoyable and nice to read about Spanish Harlem. It was a great story about the people that lived in that area. I had to read this book for my English class, although if it wasn't for use in a class, I wouldn't probably get it, but now that I did, I would recommend it to all my friends."
2,I wanted to like it better...,"I was really looking forward to reading something different, something authentic and real, and all of the buzz suggested this was it. But aside from the really wonderful descriptions of the neighborhood and ways people live, the book was a let down. The dialouge was corny and the plot was derivative. But I can't argue that the author has talent, I just hope he puts it to better use next time...."
3,Flawed but extremely interesting 1st novel.,"Ernesto Quinonez's first novel, Bodega Dreams, is a modern update on the Great Gatsby formula, set in Spanish Harlem. Quinonez has an original and authentic writing voice-particularly when it comes to establishing setting, character and mood- but the dialog is often a step behind-a few too many clichés, language a little to refined for a ghetto setting. Nonetheless, his sense of timing is good, his characters are memorable and the story is deftly executed. This is an author who shows great promise. I'm looking forward to his sophomore effort."
2,"Flimsy, cheap...",I received the package quickly and was initially satisfied with the product- until I tried wearing said chain... the tiny clasp is extremely awkward to use- VERY difficult to put together... and to top it off it just broke. DO NOT purchase this it is cheap!
4,some more good ani,"if you are an ani difranco fan, this cd will fit perfectly in your collection. it has some un-released songs on it, as well as mixes of swing, which happens to be one of my favorite songs. it is worth the few dollars as an ani addition to any cd collection."
4,First Off...,"...this is the sequel, to the animated Hellboy movie ""Sword Of Storms"". Everything I said in my review of that movie, applies to this one just as well. The only major difference being, this story actually seems to tie-in to the live-action film series, a little bit better. If you enjoyed the ""Sword Of Storms"" feature and/or the live-action film series, then this is worth your time. If you didn't like the live-action movies, don't bother with this one."
3,Average,This is not the best sponge but it is also not the worst sponge. It is not really soft but it isn't hard either so this is not the problem. The problem with that sponge is that the handle is too big. I used it for my back and because of the long handle it was hard to reach up where my neck is. And that handle looked cheap so I was afraid it would break but it lasted the four months I used it without breaking (i made a couple of small holes in the sponge but that was not the end of the world). I purchased three and I don't regret having two more of these sponges.
5,THE SOUND OF WAVES,"Japanese tend to be shy and meek people, which surprised me greatly to read the dramatically brief and stark blunt nudity scenes described in this book. Such an innocent cover, but this book really is full of shocks and surprises. This truely is a timeless story about two lovers, a rich female with a posessive and over protective father, who's intelligence we are incapable of knowing at first glance. Super."
2,My Opinion,"The book Sound of Waves is a book my classmates and I are reading for our English 1 class. Our opinion on this book, is it's the most unintersting book we have ever read. Nothing very exciting happened and there's no big tragedy happening in the little village where the characters live. Although very descriptive, it's not my #1 choice for a reading book."
5,Great,"The book itself is beautiful. It's an easy read on a simple love story. My only complaints would be the time it took to get to my house and the spine had a little dent. I needed the book to get to my house ASAP (for school), but it took a lot longer than I expected. The spine on the bottom had a small but noticeable dent. Both problems are minor, but are the reason why I am rating this a 4 out of 5 stars."
4,A Beautifully Simplistic Romance,"The Sound Of Waves is one of the best ""little books"" I've ever read. While there isn't much deep philosophical introspection, it is a brilliant story, crystal-clear, with no wasted words. It tells the tale of Shinji, a young man just becoming aware of his sexuality, and his love for a pearl diver named Hatsue. While the love story is very traditional and familiar, Mishima uses subtle and strikingly vivid imagry to make the book fully come to life in the reader's mind. Mishima was a body-worshiping homosexual, and like the romantic works of Pierre Loti, the boy-girl story is probably a cover-up for a boy-boy relationship. Mishima's lust for the male body comes out in this book during his descriptions of the young men at their club meating. The book's ending, a nice twist, also brings into focus that aspect of Mishima's philosophy and lifestyle. I enjoyed the book very much; it was good company during a sleepless night."
4,A sweet love story,"The story Mishima tells of the love between a young fisherman and a pretty girl newly-arrived into his tiny world is sweet and touching in itself. However, peeling back the layers of the love story reveals Mishima's sense of Japan and its place in history.The Japanese nationalism lurking underneath the simple story is evident only upon further understanding of Mishima's life and writings. There are far away lands where wonders exist that could not be seen on Shinji's small island, but these things lose their meaning once they are out of sight. Shinji himself is young and strong, a metaphor for the Japan that Mishima imagined.A very good book for the beginning reader of Mishima. A second read is warranted to understand the nationalist underpinnings of his writing, though."
5,Perfect for preschoolers!,"I bought this book for my mother, who is a preschool teacher at one of the local day care centers. She borrowed this book from the library and renewed it the maximum number of times before I offered to buy it for her. She is going to do a whole lesson plan around Dog and his colors.The paperback version of the book is very large and easy for the kids to see at circle time. It has bright colors and clearly delineated pictures. If kids are going to be handling it themselves I'd recommend getting the hardcover version.Such a cute book! I might have to get a copy for my own collection of children's books!"
2,not barbara's best work,"I should start by saying that Barbara Delinsky's newer novels are very good and I highly recommend them, however this book is a reprint of an '87 release and not at all like her newer ones. I was very disappointed in it-- it has poor character development and it's just all over the place. I had a very hard time even getting through the first few chapters. It did get somewhat better but resorted to sex to keep you hooked, which of course did not work....I recommend skip this book and check out one of her newer novels, like LAKE NEWS or COAST ROAD"
5,Blissful listening,"If you love Baroque music this is a CD that will deepen your appreciation of it and lead to many hours of blissful listening. You will also learn that Jacquet de la Guerre is one of many female composers throughout history who have been overlooked, forgotten and underappreciated. My favorite pieces are the cantatas. The soprano soars on the sacred cantata Ester. On the secular cantata, Le Sommeil d'Ulisse,the violin, flute, harpsichord and voice weave together in beautiful harmony. The harpsichord playing is amazing. On each listen, there is so much more to discover. Frances Fitch and friends bring de la Guerre's music back to life so that we may enjoy it in the 21st century and go off the beaten path to appreciate a lesser known but worthy composer. The few spoken word tracks on these 2 CDs includes letters from de la Guerre in French with English translation in the liner notes, which adds to the feeling of immersion in a different time and place."
1,Poppycock!,"This book is pure rubbish! Another Christian fundamentalist view of sex and morality. Like the Bible, this poorly-written book lacks any sense of reason and reality. From its grammatically incorrect title to the very last word, this book is not recommended for the thinking person. Skip it!"
4,Not Fast Enough,"The most interesting aspects of this work are the method by which Hammett chooses to tell the tale and the fact that it shows the development of Hammett as a writer. The reader learns the details of the case as they unfold and are experienced through the eyes and ears of the nameless operative of the Continental Detective Agency. We encounter, with the op, the same truths, half-truths and untruths while moving toward a solution. The problem is we do not always seem to be moving fast enough."
4,a little known gem,"When you think of Hammett, you probably think only of The Maltese Falcon and The Thin Man. The (great) movies probably play a role in that. But don't overlook The Dain Curse. It's fine reading for any crime novel fan.And a note to those whose reviews described the plot as choppy: this novel was originally published in three separate parts in one of the pulp magazines (anyone know which one? I don't recall) so all three parts were written to be part of a bigger story, yet be complete and self-contained in their own way."
4,"Classic detective fiction, but not the best Hammett","""The Dain Curse"" is a great read ; the dialogue is crisp and the story zings along at a great pace. The main problem with the book is the disjointed storyline ; the plot is subdivided into three sections, each with a self-contained storyline, linked up by the supposed curse around the leading female character, Gabrielle Leggett. The denoument of the book feels contrived ; I felt that Hammett had probably thought up the three separate plots and had (not completely successfully) attempted to link them together. However, this is a minor quibble ; the book is a great read and I would recommend it to all fans of detective fiction, although this may be a disappointment to those who have previously read ""Red Harvest"" or ""The Maltese Falcon""."
4,A sleeper,"I bought this album not because I was expecting a high quality record, but because of my devotion to whatever the former members of The Verve produce in music. Turns out the album is exceptional nonetheless. A 'no frills', hard rockin', hard hittin' album created by talented, dare I say ""veteran"" musicians. The singer is equally explosive, soulful, and has a swagger about him that is missing in many of these indie pop/rock darlings. But don't be confused, The Shining are (were? I think they split up) not ""indie"" but rather hard rock with a classic rock appeal that I so beg for in recent years of over-pollinization. Every song on here is excellent, or like in the case of ""Until The End,"" epic. (The rhythm on ""Find Your Way Home"" is brilliantly fluid.) An album for the casual rock fan as well as Verve fans. A buried gem I will be going back to again and again."
2,...even worse,"Ravin should stop compiling buddha-bar cds !! his best remains vol 3, there is no more inspiration, making the last two buddha-bar less than average.Visan or Popat or even a new DJ should make the next one. i hope this gets read by the georges V people ."
4,video order went well,"The packaging on the tape was slightly beat up, but I guess that's to be expected with a 10 year old video from a video rental place. It played great and arrived promptly. I'd recommend buying from this seller"
3,La Lectrice,"This movie is like many French movies: wacky humor, political and philosophical references, and sexy. It's entertaining and amusing especially if you understand French and/or have read the books that la lectrice reads to her clients. Good if you like Miou Miou or French comedies."
5,Vampires,"This book is filled information on the historical background for the Vampire Chronicles. It's an absolute ""must read""! It also contains the original short story by Anne Rice of Interview With The Vampire."
2,Not exactly what I was looking for,"Alright, when I got this book I was expecting an all out guide to Anne's land. Not an encyclopedia. In fact, I had to wonder what Anne was thinking when she allowed this to be printed. Most fantasy world guides go through the characters, settings, histories etc. This does do that, if you read from cover to cover and combine it in your mind.Skip this book and check out a few of the well researched and wholly satisfying web sites on Mrs. Rice's Vampires."
3,Mueller HG80 knee brace,My knee size was on the minimum diameter side of the knee size range and I can not adjust it to fit snugly. It tends to slide down my knee rather easily and I have to keep pulling it up. I had purchased a HG80 hinged knee brace earlier and it seemed to fit OK. It seems to do the job.
1,"Not as described. Only Stan ""Furbie"" Friedman","Ok. the Furbie comment was just wrong. But I wasnt up for Stan's hour long talk on ET. Only because i have heard it so many times before. And when he says that ET views us as potentially dangerous (future) due to nukes and our aggressive nature I want to laugh. ET owns us. They do not think we are a crazy race committing tribal warfare, etc. We are just biological machines that are running biological programs. More or less innocent.The other 2 speakers were not on this video. And I really rented it because I was interested in whatever his name was that had ""kundalini"" in his bio.I recently started practicing that type of yoga and was curious if there was a link with it and the ET phenomenon.1 star due to false advertising.Here is the vid on Kundalini Yoga that I started practicing if interested.Kundalini Yoga - A Journey thru the Chakras with Ana Brett & Ravi SinghEnjoy,P90"
1,It broke,"Mine was working ok, over a 25 foot range. They had to see each other, and when people walked between them it fuzzed. After a few months it stopped working. Not completely, just was never really clear reception anymore, though the setup never changed. I tried different angles and view factors for weeks, then tossed them in the trash."
4,A lot of colored/textured selection,"I know this is a random selection, but it seems like I got a disproportionate amount of the colors and textures, and not very many of the standard condoms. I'm interested to try ""extra lubricated"", but in my mind that's just probably extra-gross. Wish me luck!"
3,Not as great as I thought,"Yes, there are lots of condoms in the package. But there are only a few brands in it. And I found out most of them are made in India. I don't know about the quality then."
2,Lacks true variety...,"I'm not reviewing the condoms themselves, but the ""variety pack"" altogether.Like other reviewers say, I got a lot of Durex condoms. If you don't like Durex then I don't suggest buying this pack.I also received about 12 condoms that expired within 6 months after I purchased the pack, when the product description guarantees a minimum of 2 years."
3,Chi Kwan Chun stars again,"The highly talented Chi Kwan Chun is a young shaolin master on the hunt for the man who killed his father. It just happens to be the red lamas great leader. In order to get revenge he will have to get past many different obsticles, along with making it through the red lamas hate alive."
4,nice,"i bought these speakers in a package (hta-4906) which came with 5 of these speakers and a 50 watt subwoofer.The moment i hooked them up, i was amazed at the quality of the sound from such a small set of speakers. Of course these are no bose, but for the price they are great. I paid 90 bucks for the set, and im impressed. They have great highs and mids, but are missing the bass, but that was why it came with a sub. The subwoofer really helps bring out the bass, and i think is a nessisity.For the price, you can't go wrong."
4,Great value,"I have 2 sets of these little monsters along with the KLH center channel speaker and a Yamaha sub. Been using KLH for quite a few years mostly due to cost. But, Have always enjoyed the quality and sound from these.My ""man cave"" sounds great with these as front LR and Rear LR."
4,The Beauty of Simplicity,"Both the story and blue-ink illustrations are simple but charming. There's nothing mythopoetic here, but there is something magical about just being out in the wide-open country picking berries (we're going to pick wild blackberries today!). An excellent short bedtime story of the ""light reading"" variety."
4,A little long...,"While I love the story, the simple illustrations and the theme, I think it is somewhat longer than it needs to be. My two year old tends to agree and begins squirming to get another book before we finish the story."
5,A True Classic Child's Book,"Blueberries for Sal has always been a favorite of mine, and now my three-year-old son is enjoying the book! We've read it bunches of times, and now he recognizes it at the library when we see it. We've checked out the audio tape a couple of times, and have it right now. I think I'm going to have to renew it because it's all he wants to listen to in the car! On one side is a nice reading of the story, and on the other, little songs, games and comments from the readers. Some are familiar, such as ""Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Turn Around"" and ""The Bear Went Over The Mountain"" and some are new, such as ""No Bears Out Tonight"". It's a better value than many books on tape, which only have the story and not the extras like this one does."
5,The one book that stands alone in my memories of childhood,"This was one of my favorite books as a child and I have passed the book on to my daughter. The pictures and story are excellent accounts of the misadventures of children, human & animal alike. Every mother with a small child can relate to the mischievous & innocent thoughts of wanting to eat more than they care to pick"
2,Blue Berries For Sal,I did not like it that much because bears do not talk because bears are bad.The pictures do not have color.I like it a little bit.
5,Amazing Art Work,"This deck is all I was expecting, The art work is wonderful, it was a good purchase."
3,One more CD with Hayride recordings,"The Hayride shows where Elvis Presley performed have been released a million times. If we look at this CD it has a wonderful artwork, with one of the best Elvis cartoons I've ever seen, includes a poster with that drawing and also includes a few interviews with Elvis in 1955 and 56 that I had never heard before. Anyway, not everything is good. We find that the songs here, have already been released by a lot of labels, as I said before, and them all, including this one, with a horrible sound quality. The only two songs that Elvis never recorded later ""Twedle Dee"" and ""Maybellene"" are here, but you can also find it in the 50s masters box by RCA with better sound quality... To sum up I'd say that we all Elvis fans like having any version of the Hayride shows and this is a good one to have, not the best but a good one."
3,Okay if you keep it oiled,"Worked well, but paint chipped off and it rusted easily. Wouldn't buy another, but it served its purpose for the summer I used it."
4,Red Dragons Pale in Comparison to an Enraged Tyrannosaurus Rex,"Out of all of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Adventures, the Jungles of Chult is one of my personal favorites. Imagine dropping your pc's into a remote land in Faerun. A jungle spreads for miles like a vast ocean of inestimable green. Add a fabled relic, rampaging dinosaurs, a lost city, and a group of fanatical cultists, and you have yourself a grand campaign.The only complaint that I have against this module, is its lack of pictures. Surely Wizards could have found the time to insert more art in this adventure!But other than that, this is a great product, one that every DM will enjoy."
2,Danger NOT A FIREWIRE DRIVE,This product appears to be firewire and usb. I even went as far as looking up the model number on the Maxtor web site and speaking with an Amazon staffer over the phone before buying. Everything pointed to this being a Firewire drive but when it arrived THERE WAS NO FIREWIRE PORT ON THIS DRIVE!!!! Do not be fooled by the Technical info on this product like I was.
5,Thanks Godness I found you,"I have been searching for the Betsy books ever since my oldest daughter was born 9 years ago. Reading about the birth of Betsy's little sister, Star, turned me on to reading for the rest of my life. I couldn't wait to read every book in the series. This book is one of my fondest memories as a girl in elementary school. I only hope to share these with my two little girls. I also hope that someday they will be republished for new generations to enjoy."
1,Gets loose over time,"The plate that goes over the door knob gets loose over time. Now, every time the door is unlocked it pops off. Very annoying. It would be better if the cover was screwed in like the rest of the door knobs in my house."
5,This Tart No Lemon,"Casey Jones is tough and smart. Astute, even. And genuinely funny. She is a creature of lusty appetites, incredible fashion sense and emergency hair-coloring measures. Her past is shady, her credentials suspect. Lust and mayhem rule. As is true of all pop fiction, this one lays bare its milieu. Take to heart Casey's insight: ""When I was done packing it in, I felt like someone had poured cement down my gullet --the true test of a good southern meal."""
5,More!!!,"That one word sums it up - I want to see more. Great writer, great story - had me laughing out loud and staying up late to see how it ends. Can't wait for the next one - I just hope she avoids the recently common trend of killing off the love interest."
5,Casey Jones,I live in NC (inplant) and I found the book to very entertaining. I enjoyed all the twists and turns of the book. Great Author.
5,"Great Battery, Great Deal",Holds a charge longer than the battery that came with my Canon1000IS and is available at a great price (of course they lower it after I've bought one).
3,"""Wild!"" Remix","""Blue Savannah"" was a great song off of the 1989 ""Wild!"" album, maybe the best. However, there was no need to remix it, seeing as how it kills the original passion that was in the song. Also, the flip side, ""Supernature,"" was done better in its original version, by French DJ/disco star Cerrone. So, instead of the single, try finding a copy of ""Wild!"" and search a little bit for Cerrone's original, to be found on a few different disco compilations."
5,I loved this movie,This movie was the 1st Korean movie I have ever watched. It is an amazing movie and the story is to touching. I ordered from Amazon and I received it today. I can't wait to watch it again ...Thanks Amazon
3,Sick persona but...,Well Sauce does bring great charisma and dope lines I just can't get past the production. Very average production from a MC who can offer more to a fresh beat. C+ at best (thanks to jigga)
3,Classic WWII Adventure,"They did a nice job of restoring and putting this on DVD. Excerpts from the movie are shown in a window in the menu. A featurette ""A String of Beads"" is included. I thought the featurette was a bit slow but the movie is good. Gene Tierney, Bruce Cabot, and Harry Carey all give good performances in Sundown. The movie takes place in Africa during WWII. Bruce Cabot is the commander at a British outpost and he must contend with German gunrunners and rebellious tribes. Gene Tierny as a caravan trader and Harry Carey as a big game hunter come to his aid. If you enjoy older movies like Beau Geste or Casablanca you will probably enjoy this as well. The price makes it well worth owning if you collect classic movies."
2,If it has been RM!,"Having been in the Film/TV Industry for some 40 years, I think I can make the following comment:If as the VCI box states 'Digitally Remastered', I think I can safely say that it has been remastered from a VHS Copy.I know the extremely poor Video & Audio is going to definitely lessen my enjoyment of the movie, thus I'm sure that it's safe for me to offer only 2* at this stage.If you are going to watch this on a fairly old 4:3 TV that isn't overly sharp and does not add any video noise to the picture, it may be good for a weekend matinee, but please, don't expect too much from this version.Likewise if your sound set-up is Hi-Fi in any way, it's only going to emphasize the very poor sound.I'm sure I'm not being too ""picky"" as many many movies, much older than this one, have been wonderfully restored to make their presentation A1 on any entertainment system."
1,Rubbish machine,"This is my 3rd Black and Decker bread machine over the last 13 years. The first one was great absolutely loved it and it lasted almost 8 years. The second one also great no real complaints except for the recipe book so used the original book. This machine however is terrible. No recipes that I will use, difficult to remove the paddles, overdone loaf on the outside, complicated panel and menu. Hardly ever use it and will look for a different brand shortly."
2,Lasted 10 months,I received this as a gift and it lasted 10 months before one of the paddle drives broke. It won't knead properly with only one. B&D promises a new replacement machine with the one year warranty. Have to pay for shipping of new machine. Lid is not molded very well at all in the rear and heat discolored the plastic lid over the months. Worked well for 10 months. Paddles tend to come off inside the loaf after baking and can be difficult to remove. Am waiting on a replacement. Will go for a different brand next time. Scant recipes included in booklet.
5,Great older book,This has a great deal of helpful information about the early irons works. It is concentrated and not scattered through difficult to find pamphlets.
1,Disappointing,"It's taken me months to read the Spanish version of Zorro because I can't get interested in the characters or the plot. Her writing is heavily narrative with little character development. For instance, she'll introduce a scene that describes in great detail the location or activities of her characters while only briefly stating what they are feeling.I was surprised by the very dry style of Zorro because I'm also reading her novel, ""Portrait in Sepia"", in Spanish. In ""Portrait"" she writes very expressively and imaginatively. Perhaps in Zorro she got caught up in trying to produce a historically accurate novel at the expense of the rest?"
2,Never came off the page,"I gave it two stars because the plot outline had potential and the writing was grammatical (although the proofing/editing occasionally left something to be desired). I am a Zorro fan from way back (nevermind just how far back) and I really wanted this to be good, but the characters and the action never came off the page for me."
1,"Zorra, the Dull Blade","I'd have thought it impossible to write a dull Zorro story. A bad one, sure, but one that's dull as well?Allende's Zorro is a harmless, ineffectual, hormone-hobbled fop. The story has a few bold moments, but I soon began to wish the hero would grow up. I wonder if Allende had any respect left for her character when she finished writing. If you want to know Zorro's origins, read Mark of Zorro, McCulley's original serialization. It, like its hero, is bolder, more daring, and less pathetic than Allende's Zorro, who is somehow made less interesting than a mute character. McCulley recalled the basic principle: heroes should be admirable. Allende's Zorro is a narcissistic adolescent who would be more at home in the mall, or endlessly reading self-help books.The paperback has this going for it: the cover is more appropriate to the story."
3,An entertaining read for anyone...,"An entertaining read for anyone who grew up watching the Zorro tv series or has seen the Zorro movies. The writer gives her version of the childhood, teenage, and young adult years of ""Zorro"". She has cleverly spun a tale of how this child turned to become the hero Zorro. I loved the part about his ears and the meaning of the word ""zorro"". Recommend!"
5,THIS TOY IS.....,"Awsome! It is really cool because you get to decorate the room. You decorate it with stickers and stencils. I got this for Christmas, and I spent practically the WHOLE DAY putting it together! It was really fun. My only complaint is that the walls are made out of cardboard. Hope this is helpful!"
3,What's all the buzz about?,"I'm not sure if this is really what we were waiting for.Except for some unheard before bursts of creativity from Alejandro Acuna and others (mostly percussionists), everybody does what they always been doing since whenever they joined WR. Jaco is his usual self and sometimes it sounds like he memorized his own solos.Some other interesting facts revealed on these tracks : the ""Procession"" crew pulls it even further away from what WR was all about in the beginning, there are very few new never before recorded tunes, Weather Reporters were undoubtedly at their best in the early 70's; ""Live in Japan"" can't be beat. Too bad there was so little material recorded at that time. I kind of regret spending my money on these discs. I think it would be better to realease one longer ""almost-perfect"" album and avoid many obvious signs of redundancy."
3,Misleading names,"It is a good overview book, but when we got to Belize realized that a lot of the sites that are listed are not called by the same name at all - so hard to determine what sites we had really dived compared to the book. Also it covers a lot of area in Belize (if you are going to Ambergris Caye then maybe 1/2 or 2/3 of the book is useful)."
4,Ithas lots of magic and is suprsing,It was suprising because Adam made the dowser work .There wasa lot of magic in the story.My favorite part was when Adam flooded the house. Jacob
5,Scary cat eyes make you wonder what's inside The Wish Giver.,"The Wish Giver is about a little man with red cat eyes. Three kids meet him in a tent at a church social. The wish giver tells the three kids, ""I can give you whatever you want."" Polly, Rowena, and Adam make their wishes but they backfire and many bad things happen. There is only one person who can save them! Read The Wish Giver to find out what happens. I would give this book five ***** because it was exciting."
3,The Wish Giver,"The Wish Giver was a good it is adventurous. There is four main characters they are Polly, Rowana, Adam. Stew. They all made the wishes and they all went wrong. Polly's wish was to be popular. And it went wrong. Rowana's wish was that Henry would put down roots in Coven Tree. Adam's wish was that it would rain, because the crops were dry. Stew's wish was that all the other wishes would turn back to normal."
4,The Wish Giver,"I like this book because it's surprising. This book is surprising because there are four characters and each character makes a wish. Once the first girl makes a wish, you try to guess the rest of the wishes. Also the book is well written, and the wishes were granted in a funny way. I think fifth and sixth graders should read this book because it's unexpected."
4,The Wish Giver,"I thought The Wish Giver was a good book. The author described what was going on with great detail. I could picture every chapter in my head. Since the book was a fantasy it's harder to get the reader to picture it, but Bill Brittain did a good job. For this book I always wanted to read more and see how the next wish was going to turn out. The book told how three people had the chance to make one wish. They made their wish, but it wasn't exactly what they wished for."
2,Make A Wish,This book has won 1 award. I give this book a two star rating. This book is about a man that gives out wishes that you ask for but you have to pay for them. When you get down more in the chapters there are twins in the story. This book has black and white pitcures. I like this book because it about wishes.I'm not going to give up the story. I think that this book is good for kids because it does not have any bad word in this book that is what makes it great.
3,First One Was Awesome,"I'm starting to enjoy the songs on this CD a little more with repeated listens. But the truth is, their first CD completely kicks this ones but. This second one is just kinda dull, not bad, just nothing too special. You'de want them to either do one of two things with a follow up to their first Cd: either come up with some more great hits or maintain a cool and unique sound. This second album doesn't do too much of either. BUT GET THEIR FIRST ONE! ITS AWESOME!"
4,Not just for the holidays,"This is an excellent 9 track mini-album. Though the theme is Christmas, I find that, unlike a typical holiday album, it works just as well in the middle of the summer. The topics are really more just insightful observations on life, loosely connected with the holidays. Compared to ""A Week Away"", I would say that the songs here are overall not quite as strong, but if you are a fan of Spearmint you won't be disappointed. My favorite song here is ""I Went Away""."
3,Didn't use it.,"I purchased this item based on America's Test Kitchen's recommendation, however, even without using it I wasn't happy with it. I am seeking to replace all my baking pans with pans that do not have the ""rolled edge"" on the underside. For me, it's an area that retains water (no matter how long you leave it drying), which then causes the pan to rust on the underside. Sadly, this pan had those rolled edges and I refused to try it - so I returned it."
1,Poor followup to his grip book,"I bought his grip book first and was very impressed by its catalogue of grip equipment. It not only explained the purpose of each piece but gave an insiders view on its application as well as a host of other tips. This book is allmost the complete opposite. For the price, I received what amounts to a reprint of some general information from the grip book, plus some reproduced catalog information from the various manufacturers of camera mounts, cranes, trusses, etc. What I expected to find: how to rig a camera to a vehicle, how to rig equipment to structures, scaffolding, etc., how to build rigs or to adapt commercially available equipment. A skinny little book, hardly worth the money."
5,great and dirt cheap,did exactly what i needed and perfect price...couldnt ask for anything better. i have no cons so there is nothing bad i can say about the item. each end fits snug on my input cords i am very pleased
1,Currently in Trash Can,This part arrived quickly from the seller but was unusable. There were visible manufacturing defects in both inputs (female 3.5 stereo jacks) and despite this I attempted to insert male audio jacks to no avail. I tried 2 different jacks and even with significant force was not able insert the male ends more than a third of the way in (not even close to making the necessary contacts to function). It is now in the trash can.
4,"Mortal I, good,","Mortal II, sucks. The guy playing Kahn. His acting is as bad as when he was in the movie Codra. on the plus side, Sonia's tits look bigger(only because it's a different person).This movie might be why they did not make a third movie"
3,MK movie review part 2 7/10 part 1 on DVD reviews of Mortal Kombat,"This review is for the 1st MK movie read part 1 1st. So Raiden tells Liu Kang, Sonya, & Cage the tornament ain't about revenge a vendetta or ego it's for the the fate of the World. My favorite fight scenes Liu Kang vs Reptile Cage vs Goro & Cage vs Scorpion Robin Shou, Linden Ashby, & Bridgett Wilson all meshed well together the casting of Lambert as Raiden was great Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa he may have not looked like MK1 Shang Tsung but he was excellent. Good soundtrack great fight scenes it was rather a good film adaptation of a game. It really shows that if Paul WS Anderson doesn't write the script he can produce decent movies."
3,pretty cool for the price,"pretty cool disk.... both movies. the only flaw is that it is full screen.... so on you hdtv things look a little stretched (unless you change the settings and blah blah blah, may as well watch it on a regular tv) the stretching isnt too bad though.cool to have if you are a MK fan. unless you wanna wait for the blue ray, when ever that will happen..."
2,Woohoo,"I actually hate these movies,but its a christmas present for my man so I paid for it and now i get to suffer for it...love how fast this came to my house...amazon rocks."
5,"Become part of their ""Little Scene""","Isle of Q is completely underrated and doesn't get enough play on the radio...The singer's voice is an intriguing blend of gruffness with, dare I say, soulfulness? The lyrics are beautiful and having meaning, aside from what seems to be the popularity of ""I hate myself and want to die"" or ""I hate you and want you to die"" lyrics that permeate the rock scene lately...Mos def check it out!!"
1,absolutely awful,"""black comedy"", ""dark comedy""? i don't think so. it was awful. kevin spacey certainly has his moments, but not enough of them to warrant renting it. don't waste your time."
1,I hated it...,If anyone thinks this movie is funny then I am depressed about the thinking in the world today. This was a depressing movie with sick torture scenes. In the movie 9 to 5 they tortured their boss too but it was light and funny. This was dark and depressing. Don't waste your time.
2,"HEY LION'S GATE MARKETING DEPARTMENT: ""YOU LIE!!!""","SWIMMING WITH SHARKS is not ""hysterical"" nor is it ""incredibly funny""(as per the DVD liner notes). Rather it is diabolical stealth horror masquerading under a cloak of pseudo-humor wrapped in veiled misogyny. Approached from this vantage point, I will grant ""SWIMMING WITH SHARKS"" is definitely not boring; then again, murder rarely is."
2,Plot and story development weak,"It starts off interesting and then it just goes down the path of boredom. The plot becomes predictable and the repetitive way in which the story unfolds in tiresome. Acting is great, the way the film was put together is a mess."
5,Great,"Had no idea what this was, but it was entertaining and informative if you want to shoot your own video."
3,deffinatly not tommy's best!,"Well as a huge tommy fan, like always I was very excited about a new album comming out.I couldn't wait to get my ears into it which was very hard to do as not many places sold it until very recently! But I got it! Yes there are some sweet, kewl songs on it. But I felt it to be a bit short. And fairly simple which isn't always a bad thing but in tommy's case he's soooooo good why not show it off, not a lot of beautiful solos or drop dead licks. Tommy went on the explain on the inside cover of the album how Chet is such a awesome guitarist and tommy's admired him since he was six also how he has such awesome guitar talent and tricks. I didn't really hear much of that on the album. I did think it was good that tommy did a bit of funky singing. All up don't mind the album some good easy listening songs but much prefer ""cant get enough"" I supose all his albums can't be totally awesome!"
4,Pleased With First Order,"I found ""Healthy Mind, Healthy Body Handbook"" a very enjoyableway of learning very helpful information. Was pleased with theservice, ease and promptness of my order from Amazon.com.Janet C. Simon"
2,No Mystery,"I am a fan of Ngaio Marsh and I'm trying to read all of her stories, but DEATH AT THE BAR was way below a Marsh standard. There was no mystery, from the moment the characters were introduced the reader knows who will die and who is the killer.The other characters who populate the bar are shallow and repulsive.DEATH AT THE BAR may have been an early manuscript that had been around collecting dust for want of a publisher that should have stayed in the bottom drawer.If you enjoy Ngaio Marsh you should read it, but I can not recommend it.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."
5,Book,"This was purchased for a our local library. Can't comment on the book itself, as I haven't read it. But shipping was fast and book was in the condition promised."
4,Good Book,I've been wanting these books for years now. I'm glad I finally got 2 of them. They came very fast and I love them. Thanks.
2,"Should call this book ""Rachel Hates to Dance""",When I was 12 I LOVED dancing so I got this book to inspire me. I never finished it then and now as I'm reading it to my 9 y.o. daughter I see why. It is mostly about Rachel hating dancing and the best dancers either being a horrid brat or a girl who just doesn't care. I think this book has turned my daughter more off to dancing than anything. I also find myself just hating Aunt Cora and wincing at everything she says. I only give this 2 stars because it is a compelling read. It is however NOT an inspiration to dance!!
5,Worth Reading,"""Ballet Shoes"" is probably the most popular book in the ""Shoes"" series, but ""Dancing Shoes"" is also very good. It tells the story of two girls, Hilary and Rachel, who are training to become dancers on the stage. It is similar to ""Ballet Shoes,"" but for anyone who enjoyed any of the other of the ""Shoes"" books it is worth reading."
3,Dancing Shoes,The books are fun for young girls to read. I tough they were a little high for the size of the book.
5,Anointed...Again!,"Brother McClurkin is truly an anointed, minister of music. Again, he has taken the listener to a place of worship. Although Bro. McClurkin's vocal skills are magnificent as usual, he does not allow you to focus on him. The focus is on God and his gift to us, Jesus. My favorite song is Create in Me A Clean Heart. This is THE worship song! Thanks Brother Donnie for another anointed instrument for God, Again!"
1,Didn't like,"I must keep this short and sweet I didn;t like this album at all and found that this project was not as strong as Live in London. I think that stronger content would have been better. And I must say that are we not all tired of hearing ""The Prayer"" I mean the song is sort of played out anyway from Celine Dion."
1,"No Thanks, Shannon","Yet another feeble cover version by Shannon Noll. The original, while now not relevant lyrically had more grunt than this release could ever muster and the whining, nasal delivery of Shannon Noll relegates this effort to 2nd eleven status. Another weak recording from another overhyped Idol contest entrant.I believe this had the blessing of Steve Waugh, but Steve likes the screeching of John Williamson, so that is not great recommendation.Cheers folks, anyhow."
1,Do Not Buy These,I wish I could give these walkie talkies 0 stars. The feedback is obnoxious. You can not hear the person on the other end anyway. Just buy something else - anything else!I had to take them away only minutes after putting the batteries in (tears & screaming followed). Not a good way to start Christmas!
1,Poor Quality,"The title song ""The Men In My Little Girls Life"" is a nice little collectable tune that was a hit in the mid-sixties, but the Collectable label has not done it recording justice. This whole album was recorded at a much less than dynamic level and the title track has 2 very audible pops in it; not unlike a used LP. I collect old music on CD, but have always been wary of the Collectable brand. Whether or not you will get a good copy from them has always be a toss of the dice. Buy the other album by Mike Douglas here."
5,mike douglas,"great sounding cd & source of mike douglas music it's tough to top the song ""the men in my little girl's life"""
5,Like the Commercial...,"To test this product, I allowed my teenage son to run the dishwasher during his week to wash dishes. I was impressed with how well the product worked. My glasses came out without streaks. But when I asked my son what he thought about it it, he exclaimed, ""Oh, wow. The dishes were shining. It was like the commercial."" Nothing speaks to the quality of a dishwashing product like an impressed teenage boy."
3,"Works the same, but with extra packaging","The tabs worked great. My dishes were clean and shiny, with no water marks at all, which I appreciated, but the excessive amount of packaging will lead me to not purchase these. The detergent I used prior to this (a mid-priced powder) left the dishes looking and feeling just as clean when properly measured, and without 20 individually wrapped plastic packages.I do not, however, have hard water at my house, so those needing a detergent that claims to really take care of that issue with dishes may be willing to deal with the extra packaging. If the company could find a solution to all the plastic wrappers, I would definitely consider purchasing.Note on the scent: if you're seeking a scent, this one doesn't smell like anything. I actually prefer no perfumes added to my cleaning products, so I was happy to not smell oranges, but if you're looking for that you may want to try a different kind."
4,Tablets are easy to use.,Ive been gettting these through Subscribe and Save for a while. Does a great job cleaning the dishes. Couple it with Finish drying agent and you are in great shape. My only complaint is that the red ball falls out of the other piece more than it stays in so you have to be careful handling them or you will be chasing it around your kitchen.
2,not as advertised,"This item was advertised as ""90 times faster"". Of course it didn't say faster than what, but it is not faster than any other flash drive made and sold by Verbatim and it is priced MUCH higher than the red Store N Go series. The packaging is a cheap brittle blue plastic rather than the rugged metal construction used on the red Store N Go series. It does have one redeeming feature if you are a techie doing troubleshooting. When the unit is plugged into a USB 1 connection the LED flashes red and when it is plugged into a USB 2 connection the LED flashes blue thereby providing a transfer rate measuring tool."
1,Little more than a scam,"I ordered this $10 intro and learned quickly this was not a good way to learn Mandarin. To properly learn Mandarin you are going to make the effort to learn pinyin and learn the tones.I was able to get out of the following shipments by immediately calling and canceling. I did some further research and suspect that many of the glowing reviews are shills. I found a site, reviewopedia that shows very different reviews. I would advise you to be VERY CAREFUL!"
2,KG should be ashamed,"Laces up awkward, poor traction on the fore foot area, and just a big ""still gangsta"" shout out to all his thugs back home. You should be ashamed Kevin."
3,A Perfectly Serviceable Shaving Cream,"All in all, my feelings about TOBS creams can best be summed up as ""meh.""They work fine, creating a lubricating lather with which to shave. However, the lather is not especially protective, the scents are not particularly wonderful, and the skin care properties are neutral.This works fine, but better shaving experiences can be had for similar cost."
2,Doesn't smell lemony,"Doesn't smell lemony, so 2 stars.Performs like a champ.This stuff lathers into whipped cream in under 5 seconds on my face.I use a 30 dollar badger brush soaked with hot water. Smells too soapy for my taste. Taylor's Rose smells like rose so I love it. Taylor's Avocado doesn't smell like avocado, thank God. It smells like a field after it rains + lavender."
1,Groan,"Oh man, this video is the pits. If you want to lose street cred with your class then this is the one to show. It's trying to be like MTV but you end up just feeling really bad for the actors. If you can get past the gut instinct of, ""What? What's happening here? Why are they sitting on a bunch of primary colored shapes? Who's that guy with the beard supposed to be?"" then you might learn some geology but don't count on your students being so open minded. This video says it was made with college students in mind but take my advice and don't show it to any child who's learned to be sarcastic."
5,Caught me right from the start,The opening lines of this book were like music. I felt drawn into the story -- could picture it exactly. It felt like I was there.
5,A turning point in the Powers story.,"The ""Powers"" comics have been police procedurals applied to superheroes, but the stories have involved wider societal issues. The Powers are stand-ins for the rich, powerful and famous in our society, and mixed with the stories are glimpses of how they affect us and warp our lives. Now, a superhero murder case - similar to those of previous ""Powers"" story arcs - leads to global catastrophies, and what many of the characters believe will be ""the end of the world."" Bendis and Oeming are simultaneously mocking standard superhero groups - the cover is a clear reference to DC's ""Super Friends"" of the 1970's - and warning us that celebrity worship diminishes us. And by centering the story on ordinary people - the former Power, now powerless cop Christian Walker and his forceful human partner Deena Pilgrim - the creators keep normal humanity and human concerns in mind."
5,The Best Volume Yet,"I disagree with the reviewer who thought that this volume echoed ""Supergroup."" Yes, the story revolves around a group of powers, but no, the plot is not at all similar (unless you count the murders, which are the catalyst in each volume). I think that volume six is the best and most creative so far--but I've still got four volumes to go. We'll see how 8 through 11 stack up. Seven was wonderful, but didn't beat six."
2,Not worth it,"This book is okay. The written simulation portion gives you a descent idea of what the test will be like. The multiple choice questions are less practical in preperation for the exam. This book has a lot of questions focused on nutrition, which is not a large focus at all on the NATA-BOC. I would not recommend purchusing this book."
1,Junk,As others have mentioned there is excessive static. One of my units crapped out after 13mo. This is fairly common of stuff made in China. It's too bad that most Americans are too cheap to support American made products. They sure were made FAR better than the consumer products made today. Those days are gone though.
3,Get what you pay for,"There is definitely a lot of static, but the receivers seem very sensitive also. One of the receivers quit working after the first battery change and we had to exchange it - luckily still within 90 days.Bad thing about receivers - they will not take rechargeable batteries. So that adds to the overall cost. Based on all the reviews of other monitors, this one is still about as good as it gets for the price. They all seem to have static or will randomly beep. At least this one does not wake me up in the middle of the night - unless the baby is crying."
2,Works well - NOT portable,"PROs:- good price for a two receiver monitor- good reception with little static in a 3300 sq. ft. houseCONs:- child unit doesn't use batteries so this is NOT portableA decent monitor with little static interferrence but we are out and about often and need the portability of battery operation for both child and parent units. The child unti only uses the AC adapter. Because of this, we are returning this and looking for a fully portable set."
4,Good Monitor,"This is the second monitor set we have bought. We have two sets now. We really liked the set for our older child because it has a nightlight with it. This one does not. That being said, the range on this set is very good and the ability to work on two frequencies is a must for us."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Another of Rosemary Sutcliff's Roman series is book, this again stepsfurther forward in time, to after the Roman withdrawl of Britain.One particular Roman decides to stay behind, and it costs him dearly.Attacked, his family are killed or taken as slaves. This leaves himbitter and angry, especially as his sister joins his captors."
2,"Solid, but the talking goes on for a bit too much","I buy these DVDs for senior citizens (~75 years old) who are looking to exercise. One of my seniors has back pain, so this was a very intriguing DVD. Overall, Dr. Lam does a good job. But there is way too much talking interspersed throughout and this actually annoys the one senior citizen I got this DVD for. So at least from her, she did not like it. I personally liked his gentle techniques. Overall, I'd hope that someone else produces another DVD for people with back pain (so many of us are out there) that is a bit more movement centered rather than talking centered."
4,The Kings of Melbournian hip-hop are back at it again,"After the loss of their Drummer Scott, the boys from 28 Days are back at it again with their 2nd Album Stealing Chairs. They pull off a nice mix of Hip-Hop and Punk Rock on tracks such as ""Say What?"" and ""Tunnel Vision"", while keeping a nice laid-back feel on ""What's the Deal?""This band has been compared to the likes of Sum 41 which I believe is an unfair comparison as these guys are 10 times better than that band will ever be.Highly Recommended."
5,My Favorite Vernon Howard Book,"There is so much valuable content in this book, especially towards the end when Mr. Howard talks about not resisting, and also about the topic of rejection. Over the years, this is the book I have come back to for clear explanations, and it is indeed my favorite Vernon Howard book. For many years I have kept the mental picture of the Indian brave setting the stack of wood on fire after many misses with his flaming arrows, to remind me to persist in spite of the many challenges along the path. I would be indebted to Mr. Howard if this were the only book he'd ever written because it means so much to me."
4,Great introduction,"This book is a great introduction into the philosophy of Vernon Howard. If you are new to the idea of self awakening, or acquiring good mental health, this is a good place to start. Compared to his other books, ""Mystic Path To Cosmic Consciousness, The Power of Your Supermind, and ""Esoteric Mind Power"", this book seems on a beginner level. But that's good if you've never read these other books. I could recommend this, then the other books in that order.The one and only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ""Mental Pictures"" didn't appeal to me that much. Some people need analogies and metaphores to help them to grasp a concept, I just tend to want to get to the heart of the teaching. The whole book is based on the idea of visualizing these concepts in this way, and others may find this enjoyable.That is only a minor point, I do believe this book will ease you into the philosophy."
4,Family? You betcha!,"I read this book years ago shortly after it came out. I even remember seeing an article he wrote for the Wall Street Journal that became the nucleus of the first chapter. Ching tells many very interesting stories but the one that truly gripped me was the one about the Kangxi emperor's grief at the death of his stepmother. Here one of the most pwerful men in the world was reduced emotionally to that of a child grieving the loss of his mother. He himself was already an old man who couldn't walk because his feet were swollen but he 1. cut off his queue, something one only did at the death of one's father or maybe paternal grandfather; 2. wore mourning garments when his own courtiers told him that it wasn't necessary; 3. wouldn't sleep in his palace but lived in a mourning hut. At the funeral he kept calling out ""Mother!"" in such a way that his own courtiers were embarrassed. It definitely shows that these people were indeed human subject to all the emotions we all feel."
5,An Unforgetable Timepiece,"When I purchased Infinity when it was first released I bought it on 8-track format. Its what we did. Cassettes we're expensive. 8-track players were easy to install. I remember how perfectly this recording flowed (except for the track breaks). I also remember buying the album for a girl I was dating at the time. It was a perfect make-out record. As the years past I grew more and more appreciative of the genius behind this recording. I met Greg Rolie and Steve Perry at the Southland shopping mall in Memphis (one of the first malls in the country)before the album was released. I remember how gracious Greg Rolie was and how Steve Perry, in a big fur coat in the summer, seemed thrilled just to be at the mall. Infinity is a true clasic , untainted by record company expectations and timeless in its beauty. Buy a copy for someone you love."
2,"Great Music, Terrible Sound (2006)","This 2006 remaster is horrible. I love Journey, and this is my favorite album...but this cut is garbage. There's a ton of low end distortion that really ruins it when listening on halfway decent equipment. Just don't buy the 2006 version and you'll probably be fine. I paid 5 bucks and I guess it was worth it just to have the CD, but it won't get much play time from me."
5,Simple Journey,"This is where Journey starts to gell as a band, The rich Voice of Steve Perry that lets you soar with him when he sings. and the Rockin music of Caine,and the other founding member just bring home the performace."
5,A very practical book,"""The Prize is Eternity"" by Girard Haven is about the practical work of the Fourth Way. ""Practical"" means something more than physical or mental exercises that the reader can attempt in the privacy of his or her own study. In these pages, Haven speaks about the difficult, day-to-day work to awaken from the sleep in which we are all immersed. Practical means both beginning to see things as they are and attempting to act from what one sees. Practical also means distinguishing between the efforts that one is capable of making by oneself and the line beyond which one cannot pass without outside assistance. The Fourth Way is a teaching of spiritual development ... brought to the West in the early part of this century by George Gurdjieff and Peter Ouspensky. ... It can be said that the Fourth Way, more than any other system of knowledge known to us in modern times, stresses the importance of work on being. It is not enough to know the words, one must strive to be the words..."
1,"Great if you're already in the cult, otherwise, beware","All of the reviewers of this book (except for yours truly), as well as both of the ""editorial reviewers,"" are (or, as in the case of Ms. Zannos, were) members of the Fellowship of Friends, the cult of which Mr. Haven had once been designated second in command by its founder, Robert Burton (no longer the case; he's been demoted). Its approach to the Fourth Way is highly idiosyncratic at best, a caricature of an abusive ""New Age cult"" at worst. Prospective purchasers would do well to do a little research on the Fellowship of Friends to determine whether they suppose a leader of such an organization is well qualified to be a spiritual guide. (Also, consider whether you really think ""eternity"" is a ""prize,"" like a gimcrack in a Cracker Jack box.) Caveat emptor."
5,THIS CD IS A CLASSIC,"This is the cd that MADE bone.....It debuted at #1 on all the Billboard charts, and by the end of 1996, it had sold over 7 million copies (it is probably past 10 million now though). The concept to this album is brilliant, it describes the struggles they had hustlin and bangin on the harsh streets of Cleveland....this album is a masterpiece."
4,Great Album!,"I can't give this album 5 stars because it is not perfect. It is however an excellent album. It has somewhat of a dark almost depressing sound to it. If your thinking about buying it based on hearing ""Tha Crossroads"" be warned that much of the album sounds very different than that song and you might be better off buying Bones greatest hits album which has a more mainstream sound to it. If you like the very hardcore early to mid 90's rap beats with very fast paced lyrics I would recommend this album to you."
5,BEST ALBUM EVER,"yo words cant even xplain how great this is...leatha face, #1 assasian, str8 jacket, ripsta & the 5th dog all come off lovely on this joint. I love how they just flow off 1 unuther. best joint is a tie btween crossroads, down 71 & die die die. thats some real gangsta rap. twista and all them is cool and all but bone is the nicest. they dont even have no guests cept 4 poetic hustals & graveyard shift ( rip tombstone ). this is the greatest peace of art ever. its a shame that they aint rilly 2 gether no more. bone talks about all the real s!!t that goes on in the 'hood. murder, chronic, girls, police brutality, dealin', and still facing & respecting god. u could smoke, f!!k or do a drive-by with this on. i got it 6 yrs ago and i still bump it everyday."
5,deadly beats!!!,"this cd is absolutely the best one of the bone thugs-n-harmony collection!!!especialy east 1999 and mo murda, and ofcourse tha crossroads and 1st of tha month.you have to have this album!"
5,Bone Thugs at their best!!,"How good is this cd do you ask? The answer is one of the best cd's ever created. My favorite tracks are Mr Bill Collector, Tha Crossroads, 1st of tha Month, East 1999 and the rest r all tight. This cd rarely comes out of the cd playa. If u aint got this joint, go cop it."
5,One of the greatest,"The album that put BTNH on the map. If you're a true BTNH fan, you'll know that you can listen to this cd from track 1-17 without skipping any. Thuggish Ruggish was in full effect, and everyone was loving it."
5,Smile Away,"This is one of my favorites by a ""former Beatle."" I purchased it when it first came out, complete with the annoying pops that one expected after listening to a record album several times. I wore this one out. With technology, digital audio, and no background noise, this album is really great on CD. If you like McCartney and want a CD with the ""Beatle Sound,"" add this one to your collection."
5,Brilliant,"As brilliant as it was on 8 track, but sounding much better. The packaging is as good as the re-mastering."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"I loved this album long before I knew anything about The Beatles (since it was a part of my parents' record collection and Beatles albums were not). Okay, if you're a Beatles fanatic, you can compare ""Ram"" to Beatles music to death and glean what you'd like out of it (like some of these other reviewers have done)... but why must you always compare it? Objectively, by itself, I think Ram is a wonderful album. McCartney is my favorite Beatle and I love his Beatles work. But aside from that, I love this album as an independent work by Paul and Linda, not by Paul-as-a-former-Beatle. Don't try so hard to compare it. Just listen to this album for what it is. Great music."
4,Absolute Deluxe Edition with Some Good Bonus Material,"The RAM Deluxed Book Edition (4CD+1DVD) is an absolute deluxe edition, but the DVD is not as good as the rest of the things included in the box. The recordings are incredibly good, even the ""Thrillinton"" CD -Paul's first attempt of recording with an orchestra I ha ve to say that the other CD's are awesome. I think this shows Paul at his best, but I'm still waiting for ""Wings Over America"" Deluxe Edition.I strongly recommend this Deluxe Edition, although I was a bit disappointed with the DVD."
5,Band on the Run is pauls post beatles best album by a mile but,RAM is difently the album in 2nd place its an amazing display of all of Pauls ridiculous and superhuman musical talents lucky bastard and this version is the s***!
2,Great for insomnia,"This album mostly sounds like really, really good background lounge music. Much of it sounds the same. I know Carlos Santana plays a mean guitar, but I often feel he is technically skilled, but the emotion of his playing is lost on me. The song with Everlast is pretty good, but ""Smooth"" is an inexplicable hit to me. I played this CD twice, and I'll be taking it to the local Hastings to sell to them. I'm sure I'm just missing out on what everyone else loves about this CD, but I have to be honest...I wasted my money on it."
1,Ah...horrible.,"Santana is a very limited guitarist on the face of it. True, the pentatonic scale sounds very guitar heroish coming from his ornate Paul Reed Smith, but the whole amounts to something very sophomoric and immature.The songs on the record, all written by other guys, are mediocre at best. Clive Davis put together a nice package, commissioning songwriters when needed (and that's quite often) and producers to tailor the sound to the frail and one-dimensional ears of the typical Top 40 listener and the typical Grammy voter.But what are you going to do? Santana's new record SUPERNATURAL has put him where he apparently wants to be: next to Limp Bizkit, Britney Spears, N Sync and the rest of 'em on the charts: seemingly diverse in sound, but horrifyingly homogenous in mentality."
4,Carlos does it again,"With the exception of having a RAP artist perform on this CD, I enjoyed the music Santana presented immensely...(Sorry, I just don't care for RAP).Carlos' souful playing is WONDERFUL!"
3,yawn,"okay, so it wasn't as great as I had anticipated, maybe because all the hype made it seem like god himself made the disc, I borrowed it from a friend who said it was good. I listened to it and of course ""smooth"" was good, as was the first half of the disc, but after the first half I started getting tired of hearing ""santana"" in every song, the man is a great guitarist but I didn't need to be reminded of his name every song, this is definitely not a CD that I would buy, originally I wanted this disc so bad that I could barely wait, then when I got my hands on it I couldn't listen to the whole thing before I took it out and went looking for something else to satisfy my hunger for the perfect CD. This is one you could probably do without if you don't have it already."
1,"Junk the CD,Artist etcetc","Give me a break man Smooth is fine but his new one Maria Maria oh please If I hear that song 1 more I am gonna PUKE I mean come on I know of music far better and yes that Includes 80's music etcetc the fact Mr Satana sweeped the Grammys give me a break thats' like giving Shania Twain awards and trust me she ain't got no right to em other then those Candian Awards I mean totally unfair Pop sinks to another low first It's woman that think there music wont' sell unless they show there belly button GIVE ME A BREAK THAT IS DOWN RIGHT NASTY no one should have to see that In public anyhow so to end I say this sorry Mr Santana u gotta go I mean I know of Artists that made good music back then and Its' still good today,example Harry Chapin still one I like..."
3,Rob Thomas is the best!!!,The only reason I like this album is because Rob Thomas sings asong with santana. Rob is the sexiest and most gorgeous man in theworld. He has such a beautiful voice. Love ya Rob!!
2,"Sorry, but OVERRATED","It's true.... I really tried to like this album. I mean, it isn't terrible, but it certainly is not the classic that all the sheep are calling it. As you listen to it, and try to keep an open mind to all the diverse influences that are present, it quickly becomes apparent that what you have here is a mediocre song from nearly every guest-star and Carlos himself. I'm sorry again, but it needs to be said. OVERRATED. If you must hear ""Smooth"" (as though you don't hear it enough on the radio) save a few bucks and buy the single. The rest of the album feels disjointed and incoherent."
3,santana?,"this cd is okay but not great. as a fan of the old santana i found it hard to sit through some of the guitar melodies as they were shot down by overated pop stars. this is not to say that it is all bad, at times the mixture of guitar and vocals (such as the song with wyclef) turn out to be alright.Also wasn't the point of ""santana"" the great guitar backed up by like 20 drummers? the drumming in this album is so weak.."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,THIS CD IS DA BOMB! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! SMOOTH AND LEAVE YOUR LIGHTS ON ARE THE BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD!
2,sellout...,"I think it is VERY dissapointing that in the generations of Santana's GENIUS music, he has to produce a poppy album with artists that have a fraction of Santana's talent in order to recieve a Grammy. I am actually sorry that I purchased this album because it is DEFINATELY not real Santana."
1,Supernaturally Bad Various Artists Record,"This is the single-most overrated album of the past 10 years. All fluffy, superficial tunes with a featured guest. Carlos, I liked your old stuff but you seem to have lost touch with your talent."
2,Same old same old,"If you want something that's just like Santana's older stuff, you'll like this. But if you're looking for something that's fresh, new or original, don't waste your money. Collaborations, like the one with John Lee Hooker, were fun and new. Maybe next time..."
2,Way too commercial,"Another Havana Moon. Santana is just going for the money here, too bad. This Cd is rife with commercialism. It must be on the Arista label instead of Santana's own label, Guts and Grace, due to the poor quality of the content. Santana's guitar still sings like no other, but the collaberators are no where close to his level of greatness. Hopefully Santana makes enough money on this Cd to enable him to start making real music again. If you are a Santana fan, save your money. If you like today's pop trash, go for it."
1,AS USUALY GOOD STUFF!,"SEEMS THAT CARLOS HAS GOTTEN TOGEATHER WITH SEVERAL TALENTED PEOPLE THESE DAYS.ITS ALMOST AS IF ROCK HAS TAKEN A BREAK THESE DAYS OR IS SORTA SITTING BACK WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.WELL I THINK THE WAITING IS OVER.SANTANA HAS LIT THE FUSE WITH THIS NEW CD.THE BANG THAT COMES FROM IT HAS NO DOUT ROCKED THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN.WITH ITS LATIN-AMERICAN FLAVOR IT HAS MADE ROCK MUSIC WHAT IT IS TODAY, THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS.THIS CD WILL ,I HOPE GET SOME OF THE OLD OR SEASONED ROCKERS OUT AGAIN TO SHOW THERE SUFF;AS BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.ITS GREAT TO HEAR FROM SANTANA AGAIN ,THANKS ALOT GUYS....KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
2,OK,"this is ok for a quick listen, but its nothing compared to santana's earlier albums. people who like modern pop will like this, but longtime santana fans will be disapointed his music is diluted with pop culture singers."
4,Great album...and there is a hidden track!,"Unfortunately, I wish Santana would stick with the straight ahead latin stuff and not try to do something for everyone. Every song on here with the exception of the songs with Lauryn Hill (which is HORRIBLE) and the song Maria, Maria (which sounds like something Boys II Men would do..yuck!) are welcomed. Love of My Life (with Dave Matthews) is wonderful. Starts out funky and grooves right in to the latin sounds. Yaleo, which has been a concert favorite for years finally appears on an album. Smooth, is a nice Cha-Cha groove. (similar rhythms of Guajira and Oye Como Va).YES >>> There is a hidden track!!! It appears after ""The Calling"", which is track 13. It starts at 8 minutes into the same trach number. The song is called ""Days of Celebration"".If you have never bought a Santana album, this would be a great CD to pick up and then buy his other CD's. You won't regret it."
2,HAVE SOME RESPECT,"I can't believe that such a well respected, and talented band would stoop to recording with ROB THOMAS. While this may be the pinnacle of Rob's career, I would consider it the low point for Santana. The fact that it has become so popular is sad. Santana has almost betrayed its roots as an inspired and ORIGINAL jam band of the late 60's and early 70's. ""Supernatural"" lacks almost all of the bands former jam inspiration and has resorted to good marketing and the naivete of the listening commutity for success. If anyone wants to hear real Santana...uncorupted, check out ""Live at the Fillmore '68""."
2,Everything today is overrated anyway...,"I really like Santana, but this album doesn't do much for me. Just adding some of the newer artists such as Everlast and Dave Matthews and the God-awful Lauryn Hill, doesn't mean you should run out and buy this. Let the fifteen year olds buy this album because their favorites are on it. Carlos is good, but this album just sort of confuses most REAL Santana fans. It's okay, but not more than two stars, and that's being really nice...""all star"" music CD's don't ever impress me anyway, especially this one."
2,I'm a little disappointed,"I got the Santana CD just over the weekend and I'm not completely satisfied with my purchase. I had already heard the Everlast,Dave Matthews, and the Rob Thomas songs before, which is why i wanted to buy it because i really liked them. However, those are the only good songs on the CD. The Lauryn Hill song is just bad, and adding a lot of guitar doesn't help the problem. Unless you really like Santana and his squealing guitar, don't buy it. This cd is for people who enjoy 4 minute ""jam sessions"" and random melodies only!"
2,K-Tel presents hot current artists and backup band from 60's,"Need it be said? Carlos Santana, in a pact with Satan and Clive Davis, has sold his soul for a great deal of money and false adulation. If Santana had released a legitimate collection of music that they had written and performed as a band MINUS the MTV current guests, a whopping 100,000 copies would have been picked up by what's left of the Woodstock generation who still buy CDs and that would have been that. Instead we have a ""resurgence"" and ""long-earned-yet-denied-respect."" Yeah, whatever. Check back in two years and see how relevant Santana is then."
3,Been listening to Santana since day one.,"I found the cd to be very well done, the way Carlos meshes with others is a tribute to his talent. I have over 20 records and cd's by Santana and this one is in the top 10. Alot has changed since ""Evil Ways"", he gets better. For those that aren't familiar with Santana, this album will give you the fever. Check out the ""Sacred Fire"" and ""Marathon""CD's. Great Stuff."
5,Supernatural Review,"This CD is really a good one! I have even met Santana while on vacation in Maui. They are wonderful and really spirited, the CD is wonderful! Buy it and you will not be disappointed. Santana Rules!"
4,Santana Supernatural-Smooth,"To me this album, at first, was not what I would listen to, or even buy. But, after listening to the CD at my brother's place, it was a CD worth to buy. An avid listener of all types of music, Santana goes straight to the top ten of the genre of music I listen to. Although, O Ye Como Va still reins supreme, Smooth comes in second as my faves of Santana."
5,Ultimate musical adventure,This is the ultimate musical adventure skillfully lead by the one and only Carlos Santana.The variety and talent involved in this project is made coherent and held together by the musical glue created by Santana's searing guitar licks.
1,One of the worst albums ever,"I don't know how anyone can think that this album is in anyway quality material. The fact that it is up for a Grammy leaves me speechless and in shock. 'Supernatural' sounds just like the same stuff Santana put out 20 years ago. I am not saying that he is not an incredible guitar player, it is just the same ol' stuff. 'Smooth' with Rob Thomas is the ONLY good song on there; every other song makes you hit fast forward, especially that one with Lauryn Hill (what were they thinking! ). For die-hard Santana fans, this album may please you, however I strongly recommend that anyone thinking the album is full of songs like 'Smooth' should spend their money on something else."
1,"Rap, pap, shmap, some red-eyed guys... Where's Carlos?",If you really love the good old Santana just don't spend your money. That's shame for the great misician. Black Sabbuth sold their souls for r'n'r. Carlos did it for rap and money. So sad...
3,Overexposure is Killer,"Smooth is a nice salsa-rock song. Put Your Lights On is a good rap-blues song. Maria Maria is a beautiful R&B song. The Dave Matthews Band does whatever they do on this CD.Put together, this album doesn't make much sense. It's like a movie soundtrack to an over-budgeted over-exposed movie. Oh wait, it is an over-exposed media-hyped CD. Yes, Santana is good, yes, he deserves credit for being a great guitar player. This album doesn't deserve to be his masterpiece, though. Still, his guitar can't make a song go completely south, even if his intentions should have made the album go south."
4,Great Album ! Great Company,"This is an album I had been looking for at the stores, we used to own it, my husband loves it and couldn't find it. I purchased it for Father's Day! It came quickly and in great condition (new!)."
2,prozac city,"I was in a department store today, and I heard a cut from this cd.I guess they thought it was good elevator music too."
5,Best Album in 20 Years !,"Having terminated his contractual obligations at Columbia Records, Carlos's first outing at Arista is brilliant. Supernatural is a well thought out and carefully put together album. His guest stars add great diversity and fun to the music whilst still maintaining that magical Carlos touch.....!!Artists and tracks of note, include: Everlast, Dave Matthews, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Mana and last but not least, Eric Clapton.Thank you Carlos. We look forward to the next 20 years......!!"
4,Supernatural Sound,"This album was the first album of Santana's that I bought. It was a little risky for me because I'd only heard 'Put Your Lights On', but I went ahead and got it. I've been very pleased with the purchase since then.The CD contains 13 songs and an extra cut of mixed genres, which adds to its appeal. It combines some excellent Latin music with some of the best rock guitar sounds I have ever heard in my life. It is the one CD I can get everyone in my family to listen to without complaint because of its mixture of rock, pop, hip hop, and Latin. The guest artists only add to its appeal by contributing their excellent musical talents to the spectacular ones of Carlos Santana and his band.Of Note: '(Da Le) Yaleo', 'Smooth', 'Corazon Espinado', and 'Put Your Lights On'"
3,what comes around goes around,"Well it's been about 25 years since Santana was on on top and now he has people talking again.This cd gives me no feeling whatso ever, because I have the feeling he should be jamming with jazz musicans, instead of temporary pop cult figures.Santana needs to be challenged musically not, catered to by his collaborators."
2,Gloomy come back,"Well, I don't like it. I have a lot of respect for Santana, even if was not a great fan oh his previous albums. But this one definitely smells too much the marketing stuff of the big production firms. Use the brand (the name and the sound) to sell something new. I knew the famous hit, and I didn't like it. Just a matter of sound. When I heard the album, I was feeling miserable. There is no inspiration. It really is a sad success. I definitely feel more comfortable with goa experimentation. There I feel some common musical roots with Schubert, Puccini, Charlie Parker, Pink Floyd, Keith Jarrett or Oasis."
4,SMOOTH!,"THIS ALBUM IS REALLY COOL. GREAT GUTAIR LICKS. THE SONG ""SMOOTH"" WITH ROB THOMAS IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC IT GETS YOU DANCING AS WELL AS BEING OF THE BEST DRIVING SONGS TO GO CRUSING TO. THE WHOLE ALBUM DOES A GREAT JOB OF TAKING CONTEMPORY ARTISTS AND WITH SANTANA AND BLENDING THEM. TI IS SUCH A SMOOTH MIX. YOU DON'T FEEL EITHER ARTIST COMPROMISE THEIR SONUD OR VIBE. YOU GET A SOLID SANTANA SONG AND A SOLID SONG THE WOULD BE UP THERE WITH THE ARTISTS BEST ."
4,"Excellent, but...","Rap (Track #6 - Do You Like the Way) does not belong on an album of this calibre. I was surprised that Carlos Santana would add this type of music and try to ""mainstream"" his work.I've been a long time fan of his and throughly enjoyed his other compliation works with other performers, but maybe I'm just getting old, but rap is definately not called for here."
2,A few gems in otherwise sapped out vein,"This album is a mixed bag. Four tunes (Yaleo, Love of My Life, African Bamba and Smooth) are exceptional and worth the price of the album. However, I found the other tracks to be very uninspired and lacking in the powerful but tightly controlled energy which generally hallmarks Santana's music and performances. They are not bad from a technical perspective, but they don't really groove."
5,Supersatisfactory,"A number of customer reviews have directed attention to the incorporation of other artists on ""Supernatural"", either applauding or severely criticizing such an eclectic mix. I choose the former, and wish to counter the charge that including a variety of popular artists on the album amounts to ""selling out"". On the contrary, I bought the album after hearing ""Corazon Espinado"" (a solid, addictive joint effort with Mana) on Argentine radio, oblivious to the fact that ""Smooth"" was all the rage back in the U.S. A work that has a little something for everyone should be heralded, not dismissed. Moreover, if it is a certain style or continuity in the album that you crave, you need only to sit back and enjoy Santana's incomparable guitar solos. The work merits all the accolades it has received."
5,This is an AWESOME CD,"I've never heard any of Santana's music before until I heard ""Smooth"" with Rob Thomas and Santana together. I'm a fan of Matchbox 20 and now a new fan of Santana! I love the latin sound that his music has and after I listen to this CD, it always puts me in such a happy upbeat mood. This CD makes me want to dance!!!!"
4,Strike three...they're out!,"Even though this book was written a long time ago the lessons learned apply to this day.Within the first two weeks of reading this book I was able to teach my 10 year old son enough that in his first two outings he pitched 3-innings of no-hit ball (the league maximum for innings allowed to pitch) each time.Fundamentals and mechanics, true then, true now."
4,One of DEPECHE MODE best song,this is one best song that Depeche Mode ever relese why : ENJOY THE SILINCE is Dark yet minimal pop and upbeat it is best for all moods and places with an ever endless lyrics My favorit Track (after ENJOY THE SILINCE :) is Sibeling : this song is perfect !!! it combine piano with soft touch of an Abstrac electronic back up that make this song so Minimal yet so Perfect that is one of the thing i find only in Depeche Mode Musicthe other cover of Enjoy the silince by Martin Gore is great to but the other remixes of Enjoy the silince is cheap and poor
4,A winner,Saw The Hold Steady on NBC - The Late Show and loved them. I'm 59 years old and the the whole cd is a winner. DCZ
1,(hed) PE...where are they now?,"Well, by now everyone know that Rap-Rock/Rap-Metal/Nu-Metal trend is basically on it's way out the door. (hed) PE may have had some infamy in it, but ""Blackout"" is basically their swansong. It's pointless. Being compared to ""Broke"" and their self-titled, it's nothing but filler. You see, what made (hed) PE's first 2 albums so different is that there was a sense of sarcastic humor behind them; A bunch of 30-something guys making fun of the whole Ozzfest bunch. They did a good job of it. I mean, who is going to take a singer like MCUD serious? Com'n...this guy gets up on-stage and puts burning incense stick in his hair and dresses in dopey-looking coveralls. These guys had humor. ""Blackout"" has nothing. It's like they went in there and could careless about anything and worried more about getting drunk.Sorry MCUD...you are not ""phat"" anymore."
5,Simply awesome!!!!!,"I just very recently found out about this band from a tv commercial about their new album and it had a clip of the first single, ""Blackout"". I liked the way it sounded, so I checked out the rest of the album and bought it; wow!! This cd is so [very] good!! It's an amazing mix of metal, melodies, rap and rageae influences; Such a unique combination. Not to mention the singer, Jahred, is one of the best singers in ALL of rock music. Check this cd. It is really astounding. BEST SONGS: ""Half the Man"", ""Crazy Life"", ""Flesh and Bone"", ""Revelations"", ""Suck it Up"" and ""Bury Me""."
3,Not again...............,"Once again a great band has gone south on me. It started with Korn, and has included the likes of Nonpoint and to a lesser extent Primer 55. I guess success makes you a bit less angry, but still, I like rock. Where did this new ""radio friendly"" CD come from? I heard Blackout first, like most, and was intrigued, but after hearing the entire CD I am terribly disappointed. For those of you that got into Hed with or after the release of Broke you may like this disc. For those hardcore fans that were into them before Broke you may want to stay away. It's okay, but won't be in my rotation long, or I'd expect yours for very long. Hopefully the Deftones or Darwin's Waiting Room can come out with a new disc and break this awful trend of bad follow up CD's......"
4,"Silly, but good.","I found this book in a coffee shop I frequent and since I like random reading, I figured I'd give it a whirl. Quite an interesting read, very enjoyable. The story is almost so implausible you have to believe it. What a completely believable family situation, and great writing to boot. I'd never heard of Liz Jensen before, but... I'd say she is one to watch. I'll be looking forward to another novel."
5,Awesome Latin/jewish hip hop - positive messages,"This album is real hip hop, nothing corny (not child appropriate). It has positive self image messages, easier to relate to."
3,Más ruido que música de este tambor,"I've read several excellent novels by Mr. Pérez Reverte, but this is not one of them. It is an interesting critical perspective on the Catholic church hierearchy and some shenanigans, and it can be instructive for the uninitiated -maybe, I suppose. There's also some nice description of Sevilla. The book starts out with some intrigue about a break-in into the Pope's [John Paul II; though he's not specifically identified, there are references to his conservative politics, his staff (including his successor), and their ways and means, etc.] computer and some related-murders; but these teasers remain mostly in the background until the end of the book. Actually, investigating and solving the crimes never becomes particularly important -perhaps the author's last and less-obvious critique of the Church.Skip it -in either language from what I've heard; unless or until you've read much better offerings from this fine author."
1,"If I could rate this my own way, I would give it a -1 star.","This program is a waste of money and time, I got suckered into this as well as the many others who bought this. It is all endurance(barely), a good way to put strain on your knee, and it does not tell you that you HAVE to strengthen your legs in the weight room as well as doing the program. Honestly, you should not waste your time. You would be better off buying the anything else that includes plyometrics AND weight training."
2,I Guess It Works...,"The product is okay... I've tested it while my friend tested another well known training and at the end of 2 months I gained ~3 inches while he gained ~8 inches. Was kinda disappointed at the results but it works. I didn't gain anything close to the amount that it promised though which is 8-14 inches.I'm now trying the product my friend is using and will update with results in a few months. If any of you want to try a different training program, try50inchvertical.com"
3,NOT SO BAD,"i definitely cant say its the best system for increasing your vertical, but it definitely worked for me. i went from just touching backboard to getting wrist above the rim. and my stamina and explosive step increased tremendously. but you really do have to do weights as well, which it doesnt really specify. the problem is that as the weeks go by the amount of time needed to put into it is pretty long (eventually 2 hrs long minimum) and thats not counting the weight workouts. also i did notice with some of the guys i did it with did get into some issues with their knees and ankles. all in all not bad."
4,Good,Haven't read it myself as it was a present. But the young man who got it and who is a great fan of Hemingway - he thinks ver highly about it.
5,"stunning, sensual, thought provoking","i chose this book for school because it was a short & easy read; i fell in love with it because, like few school books, i could relate so deeply to the main character. Edna Pontellier wakes up from a life in a dream and fights for self and independence- a struggle that anyone, especially adolescents, can identify with. I can't emphasize enough how beautiful and moving Chopin's prose is. Reading it was pure pleasure, and when self-realization and introspective thought comes along with that, you know the book is a winner."
2,Joyride off a cliff...,"Oleander fails to make a big impact on this cd. I bought it just because...well, they're Oleander. I thought their first two cds were great (Unwind being the best) but Joyride just doesn't come close to their first cds. ""Hands Off The Wheel,"" Oleander's first single on this CD is nothing special...its okay to listen to for a while, but just gets old quickly. The other songs are okay...but I dont think any of them will be radio worthy. The only other song I liked on this album was ""Fountain & Vine."" It has good lyrics and this song is the most polished. For the $12 I paid I say its not worth it."
2,"Too short, too stiff, nice pearls","I bought this bracelet for $50, and now it's a lot less, hmmm... I like the pearls, but the bracelet is very short and stiff, maybe too tightly knotted, so that I can not put it on myself. The fact that the clasp is kind of awkward doesn't help. I can not recommend this item and I would not buy it again."
3,Juicing Book,Good recpes but a little dificult to understand quanities of each ingredient to use in each.
4,Helpful,I learned a lot from this book. It explains how to use my juicer and gave recipes of what fruits and vegetables can be juiced together for tasty juices. It also provided health benefits for fruits and vegetables for healthy living.
3,"interesting, but no actual conclusion","i've read this book twice, and, while much of the social and cultural facts, discussions and conclusions are interesting--even fascinating--i cannot say that the author has determined why harry potter has become so internationally popular, and so popular across social levels.nevertheless, i did find it worth reading twice. on the other hand, i think it also proves that it is not possible to analyze the reasons for a cultural phenomenon."
1,disappointing,"This author along with all the other HP critics overthink the Harry Potter phenomenom. What is going on inthe county has a minimal effect on what fiction people read, especially for grade schoolers.People liek the idea that there is a world nobody knows about. It's not going to be complex literature because its aimed toward younger readers. JK Rowling has a good plot and a gift for writing."
2,Disappointing,"After waiting nearly four years for the Ataris next album, I had admittedly high hopes going into ""Welcome the Night."" Unfortunately, the four years was either not enough time or perhaps too much. My overall reaction to the album can probably be best described as boredom. To me, the album just lacks energy and punch. Yes, parts of it may be lyrically strong, but that doesn't help much if it doesn't grab you musically. It's not a totally lost cause however (thus the two stars) with ""Connections are More Dangerous than Lies"" and ""Whatever Lies will Help You Rest"" being among the highlights. I know a lot of their diehard fans won't be happy with this critique, all I can say is that I really did go in wanting to like this album."
4,A coda to an unfinished career; I still want more!,"When Chatwin died, it seemed that he had barely begun a new chapter in his writing career. In Songlines, his seemingly abrupt transition into a query of the primordial nature of travel left me thirsting for more of the same. What Am I Doing Here offers another cup from the well of his travels, replete with his intriguing travel notes from around the world, his visits with the obscure, the famous, and the forgotten, and tidbits from his collection of notable and sometimes ancient quotes on the nature of travel. We hardly knew ye, Bruce..."
1,Get One for the Price of Two!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ordered this dual pack. Received only one. Contacted Airsplat, first they said they would send another can. When I didn't get a ship notification, I contacted them again. They said I only ordered 1 can!!!!!!!!!!!!!In total, I must have sent at least 4 emails trying to get this resolved with no success. I would rate zero stars but 1 is the minimum.Absolutely pathetic!"
3,eh' ok?,its not thet great its not labeld properly the nozel broke and ruined my gun mag wouldent purches again its only worth buying becuz of the price
4,Historical Interest for Heyer fans,"If you are a die-hard Heyer fan like I am, and have read everything she has ever writen, you have to read this book.This is a book that Heyer herself considered sub-standard. She refused to have it reprinted in her lifetime. For a long time it was unavailable. I bought an original edition for a lot of money. It is on my valuable and rare book shelf.I found it a very interesting read. It is not one of her lighthearted Regency romances, but I dreamed of Roxhythe after I read the book. I found him a compelling, tragic figure. I actually found the book more interesting than some of her other historical novels (not the Regencies). Don't read it if you want to be entertained. Read it if you want to see another side of Heyer."
5,Astronomy and the mythic combine in Baktun,"Karen's dreams call to her, compelling her to locate her beloved but controversial Mayan female astronomy teacher in Mexico. Karen's internal journey of supressed painful memories is matched by her external adventure as she travels to Chichen Itza and beyond to witness Raven, the comet of mythic importance as the harbinger of change. Beautifully descriptive writing leads us through the textures and sights of Mexico as we enter the doorway of the Mayan prophesy of Baktun 2012. A very well written, intelligent and wholly engaging book."
2,OK for the price but not worth any more,"The pearls themselves seem to be of decent quality but the strand seems too short, its like a choker and the pearls do not lay straight. Worth the $35 but not a huge bargain for a higher quality piece."
2,I do not know who to believe!,"This necklace seems to have two personalities. Reviewers on one hand showered praise on it, and on the other disparaged it. Well, I gave it a try, and, sorry to say, I did not like it. Perhaps the quality of the newer ones are not up to par, because it seems the older reviews are better. In my case, I agree with one of the recent reviewer that the necklace is too tight that is why it does not straighten up. Also, a majority of the pearls are too small closer to the 3.0 size than the 7.5mm size. However, the pearls themselves seem to have a nicer quality. I returned mine."
4,"Of course it's good, but...","...like another reviewer, I wanted to be blown away- I will give it more spins to appreciate it more, tho- ""Rules Of Travel"" is a wonderful song, a little masterpiece- the rest, I'll have to absorb a bit more-"
1,This shouldn't be sold.,"This book has text that belongs in the margin as notes, re-flowed randomly as symbol characters into the text body. I bought this for a college class along with another book by the same publisher. It also has the text mess. I will never buy books from this publisher again and would recommend anyone against it as well. I can't use them for the class. These books (with this type of cover at least) should not be sold."
2,"Worked well for a while, but","I owned this pressure cooker for about two years. It worked great. However, just a week ago I found out that two of the screws that held the pressure valve to the cover have rusted. That allowed the steam to escape and to prevent the pressure from building. While I had done some good cooking in this pressure cooker, it is not designed to last. I guess I now have to try another brand"
5,Takes the pressure off cooking!,"I love this pressure cooker. The double handle is perfect for easy mobility. I have had it for less than a month and have used it at least 10 times already. It truly takes the hassles out of stews, soups, sauces, etc. LOVE IT."
4,More of a tip than a review,"I am not going to go into detail about how good the product is... instead I will give you a cleaning tip. I burnt something for not following the recipe the way it should have been and of course things got cooked on the bottom to a point I thought the cooker was ruined. The someone told me to use bar keepers secret to clean it and this did the trick! It does not even damage the surface. So, yeah, it is a great pressure cooker when you follow directions! :) I am very pleased with it and I would recommend to a friend or family member."
2,eh,i went with the 16 qt cannerany canner can pressure cook. i really REALLY REALLY wanted a gauge after using this one. I know how to pressure cook and the first meal with this pressure cooker ruined the meal because of the pressure. Either the seal wasnt working correctly or something else was going on.trust me - get one with an actual gauge on it.at least when you have a guage you can accurately monitor the pressure in it.
2,Rusted on the inside,I purchased it as it was stainless steel. But after 2 washes started to rust on the inside. So returned the item and was promptlyreimbursed.
1,It simply burnt everything at my first use.,"I purchased this cooker based on the customer review and, it turned out to be a total disaster!I have cooked using a pressure cooker for more than 15 years and know exactly how to use.It did not cook well enough the rice mixed with grains at first, and I put more water and reheated them in a medium heat. After 3-4 munites, it burnt off everything. I can't wash it with force as it was stuck with burnt grains.I need to return it as it is defective, but am not sure how they would react.It's not worth the money and time at all."
2,eh...,"I thought this would be super fun for my toddler and preschooler, but they never play with it at all. Also, it's really difficult to see anything happening inside (watch the beads fall, or see the plastic layers they fall through...) because the outer plastic is faceted and ghosted and hard to see through. So you can't even watch what's making the noise. Not really a good toy."
4,Not as noisy as expected!,"This rainstick contains small plastic beads rather than the metal ones I have seen in other rainsticks. As the beads drop though they turn small rotating blades creating colourful movement which my son seems quite taken with. It is not very loud....which is good! It seems to be very sturdy and with all those small plastic beads that is just as well. It's quite weighty which surprised me a little and it can be wielded as a weapon against older irritating brothers as my teen discovered, which can be quite painful. It won't keep your child entertained for hours.....but it is something that they will go back to again and again in short spells for some years. A good buy."
3,Make it yourself,"Tastes just like coconut milk and curry powder with a few simple spices. One reviewer observed that the potatoes in this recipe closely resemble tator tots. She is absolutely right. It tastes pretty good if you like curried foods, but you can make it yourself very easily, cheaper and without having to order a case, and with real organic ingredients.There is NOTHING on the package that says any of the ingredients are ""Organic"". I strongly dislike deceptive advertising and hope that this was not intentional."
4,Nice,"Tastes pretty nice, if a little bland. The nutrition facts [commented on by another reviewer] is on the can as well as this page... one 15 0z container has approximately 280 calories. Will probably buy this product again."
4,Great Guide--Only One Flaw!,"Very detailed comments on each ride. The authors have included relevant information on surrounding communities (ie laundry facilities, camping, dining, etc). Great maps!The only thing wrong with this book is a somewhat confused idea of what is East or West of the Cascades. I looked under the ""East"" section and was astonished at how few rides there were. It took me a while to realize that most of the good ""East"" rides are actually in the ""West"" sections. Somewhat distracting.Highly recommended!"
2,Looks are deceiving,"Love the look, not the function. Glasses fall off the side prongs, fall through the openings at the corners, and almost nothing stays upright in the rack. Dishes slid out of the wires, created an avalanche the shot a glass out the open corner. The silverware was sitting in an inch of water - drain holes don't work. Keep looking if you're shopping. Wish I had read the reviews before I ordered!"
1,NOT WHAT I WANTED,IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE I WANTED. I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT. I DON'T LIKE IT. CAN I RETURN IT
4,Classic Howard,"I just started reading Linda Howard novels this year and I read the last of the series about the Mackenzie family first and then had to try and find the first of the series. Fortunately Mira decided to republish these in double books. I enjoyed reading the whole series. Each book is able to stand alone even if you never read the other three books. It was a very enjoyable read, fast paced and interesting. Wolf, Mary and Joe are all very finely drawn believeable characters. The story line was kept me interested and did not seem to be a formula. Linda Howard's writing style is fast paced and I can easily read one of her books in a day. Her comtempory romances are especially good. Hope Linda Howard keeps on writing for a long time to come."
3,in reply to the previous guy about two episodes,"This series reminds me of G.I. Joe with explosions and no deaths. It is great to have 11 episodes on one disc. There are two problems I have with this disc.1. two episodes are messed up with interference.2. episodes are out of order, especially when you only get two episodes (1 on each disc) of the five part ""Tierra Libre"" story. Also, the last title on the back of this DVD is not the title on the disc.To the person who only got two episodes, I feel badly for you since my DVD has eleven. Try again, and see if they can send you a complete one."
3,would be better if in order,"those who collect complete series on dvd will understand the dillemma of out of order episodes on dvd's just for the record the episodes on this DVD are as follows (the E-# is the series episode # for reference) :01) Enter the Black Dragon E-2002) Enter the White Dragon E-4103) Fire In the Sky E-1904) The Iron Mask E-3505) the Kunichi E-4906) Masquerade E-5707) Mephisto's Magic E-2408) Night of the Voodoo Man E-2809) the Ninja Dog E-4410) Pirate Peril E-2311) the Taking of Tierra Libre E-5it was a descent series cashing in on the popularity of the rambo franchise from the 80's but it'd be more enjoyable if Lionsgate'd re-release the DVD's with the episodes in order. also please be advised the mislabelling of the final episode on the back of the case is NOT Raise the Yamato, but The Taking of Tierra Libre. hope this helps those who order the dvd."
4,Errol Flynn at his Best,"As a fan of swashbuckling and pirate films since childhood, I highly recommend Captain Blood with that charming rogue, Errol Flynn. I'll watch anything with Errol, especially the movies he made with Olivia DeHavilland. Great chemistry there. Pirates, pretty ladies, sword fights and beautiful Caribbean scenery - what else could I ask for . . . except maybe some rum."
5,Classic Swashbuckler,The movie that made Flynn a star. One of five great pirate movies no collection should be without.
4,A really Good Game,"Kingdom Under Fire was a really good game and, I enjoyed it immensely. Unfortunately I lost the CDKEY and was unable to reinstall it after my computer crashed so, I haven't played it lately. To me it was an equal to the Warcraft games and, I would play it again if I could only reacquire another key in order to get the game to reinstall."
4,Solid basic reference and tutorial on the subject.,"This was the first book I bought on this subject, and I found it invaluable as an introduction to early lantern manufacturers and lighting technology. The author clearly explains the different fuels available at different historical periods, and the technologies that utilized them. Contains many very clear reproductions from early catalogs organized by manufacturers in an easy to read reference format. Using the entries here, it is easy to locate the manufacturer, model, relative date of manufacture, and background on most commonly-encountered lanterns. The rarity guide is somewhat lacking in timeliness and should be updated, however. Despite that, I also recommend this author's Book Two as a useful addition and supplement to this book. Advanced collectors would likely be disappointed, but novices and experienced collectors will find this book interesting and informative."
4,enjoyable,"first, what I do like about the game is the difficulty, it is way harder than the average fighting game, most fighting games I just rent because I take them home and beat them in 5-10 minutes, this is the only fighting game that I have played and not beaten it in the first night I have the game. The only problem's I have is the game engine is obviousley outdated and they just put the face of Heero Yuy on their to piggyback the success of gundam wing, but the game looks and sounds better than 90% of the ... out thair."
3,Striving for more,"Unfortunately for the Non-Japanese converted Playstation, this is one of the few Gundam games available. It blends mecha from the entire series, all teh way back to 1979 in a manner that, while amusing, becomes repeptitive. There is very little diversity in ability, and unfortunately it only retains one ""story line."" The fighting is repetitive, all the moves are easy enough to perform that the challenge level is lacking. This is a one play game, and then only for fans of the Gundam series."
5,G-Battle Assault,I think this game is really tight.There lots of characters(gundams) to choose and play and battle with.There secert characters and other stuff too.I would recommend this game to a gundam fan.This game is great for a lot of people that like Gundam like me.
3,"Neah, Coulda been a little better",The game isn't that bad. What really bugged me is that it only has 1 mobile suit from Gundam Wing! I was expecting to play as Heavyarms or Shenlong! I don't even know 99% of the mechas. Only buy this game if you like the other Gundam sagas.
3,"Excellent in its original version, American cut not so good.","I saw this movie for the first time when it came out in Russia. It made a very strong impression on me. I am sure you will also find it hard not to feel for the Russian woman, used to being strong, yet so in need of love and protection, and for the boy searching for a father figure in the same horrible world of post-war Russia. Unfortunately, in its American version, the movie had to be cut (probably to make it shorter). Some of the cuts I don't mind as much but cutting off the end of the movie is just over the top! The European version of the movie has another scene where Sanya, now in his forties and an officer taking part in the Afghanistan war ( a terrible part of Russian history, the Soviet version of Vietnam ) and meets Tolyan (who did not die, after all). I will not tell you the rest, in case you happen to find the European version. But I think this ending wraps up the movie much better than the American one."
2,cheap chinese junk,Very poor Chinese quality for the price. I broke 3 out of the eleven I needed. They seem to flex only one way. I won't buy these again. Amazon should state whether the product is made in the USA or imported.
3,Great Listening!,Listen to Journey as they break into the top 20. They really start to put things together with the help of Roy Thomas Baker. Steve Perry comes forward as the true front man. The rest is history.
5,CLASSIC- A MUST HAVE FOR TRUE ROCK FANS,IF YOU ARE TIRED OF REFRIED MUSIC OR JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING WITH ENERGY INSTEAD OF DEPRESSION YOU NEED THIS ALBUM
4,Fine for an older child,"My daughter is 9 and she has enjoyed all the ""Detective Barbie"" games in the past. We own the first 2 games for the PC and purchased this one for our Playstation. Both my daughter and my son (6 - almost 7) love solving the mysteries. I think Mattel should just ""up"" the age on this game. It is way too hard for a 5 year old. I agree with the other reviews on this point. In my opnion, most barbie games are good for 7 & up. (Secret Agent, Super Sports etc.)"
4,Terrific lighting kit,"This kit came complete and was very easy to install. We put our boat in the water for the first time today, and the trailer lighting worked flawlessly."
5,13 tracks of heaven,"I honestly cannot find a song on here that I do not enjoy. From the opening track to the final one The Starting Line produced another succesful album. Track 6, Photography, is a powerful slower song that is a little over 6 minutes in lengths but never lets you down for a second of it. If their was one album to buy this summer, it would be this one."
5,BOATS,Based on a true story by the starting line is one of the most amazingest cd's to come forht in 2005. it is very well worth your money. the cheapest place to buy would be at target so run out and get your copy because you wont be disapointed. <3
2,Not their best CD,"I loved their cd, ""Say it like you mean it"". But, this cd was terrible. I only enjoyed the song called, ""Making love to the camera"". Save you're money for any of their other cds."
5,Filter,"I need this Water filter for my Fridge every 6 month, Amazon.com is cheaper than the whirlpool website, who does not like to save a few bucks right?"
3,How old is my soup?,coupon in the package expired 6/30/11 so I am wondoring how old the product is? I received my order 9/30/11
2,"Good idea, bad tase","The product packaging and assembly are pretty well done, but the soup itself tastes really bad. I've had miso at restaurants and this doesn't even resemble it."
4,very easy to make,great for a quick meal - just add hot water. it even comes in its own biodegradable bowl! I like this flavor the best out of the 3 other Annie Chun's soups I've tried.
1,"If you like miso soup, don't buy this","I really like miso soup, so I was excited about this quick meal that I could bring to work for lunch. I brought it today, so now I am hungry because I didn't eat lunch. This stuff is disgusting, and it tastes nothing at all like miso soup. The pieces of seaweed are like swallowing pieces of paper and the pieces of tofu are like eating a sponge. If you like miso soup at all, do not buy this because you will be hungry too."
5,Awesome jewel y Dan Swano,The different ways and variations Dan Swano took in this record is from my perspective the epilogue of a prolific carrer with Edge of Sanity
5,Great Product!,"Great value for the money, works well will buy another for my son! Sleek designm easy to clean just right size for a small family!"
4,Good for the price,"There are very few electric teapots that whistle. I got this for my office so that I get a signal that the water's boiling when I'm cruising on email, meeting with people or engrossed in other work. I wish it had an on-off switch. Also the pot itself gets frightfully hot (no insulation), but it's not a problem holding the handle. It gets the job done. Pretty inexpensive, too. I might upgrade later for a more robustly featured pot. But for now, this gets my tea."
5,Great tea kettle,"Since this is an ""off-brand"", I expected it to be a piece of junk. The water boils fast (and thoroughly), and there is no plastic taste. The kettle stays clean (as long as you rinse it out and don't leave water sitting in it). Very good deal. The kettle has a whistle and pour guard, which are both helpful."
3,Presto Kettle,"I ordered this to replace a whistling West Bend electric kettle. (you can't find the ones that whistle in the U.) It does it's job but the capacity is less than the West Bend, it's slower to heat and the whistle is weak. For the price I would go with the West Bend."
1,Problem,"Since I received the Tea Kettle every time I use it something inside it makes very LOUD POPS similar to the sound you hear as it starts to heat up (Materials reaction to the heat) except it's much louder.I notified the vendor about this, I got a reply asking me to define what I meant by loud POP's or Crackling noises, I repeated my concern about this and since I had another Tea Kettle exactly like this one and that never happened so I think this is not going to last very long.I never heard from that ""Customer Service"" lady again.RegardsOscar Sanchez"
3,Fast & Simple To Use,"If you are looking for a quick way to heat 2 or 3 cups of water, this kettle does just that and doesn't take up too much space.Drawbacks are the bottom becomes very hot and can burn the surface of a table or desk. A thick ceramic tile would be a wiseadditional purchase if you plan to use this in an office or bedroom. The kettle has no on/off switch, the plug must be removed from the outlet to shut it off and there isn't any way to access the inside for cleaning. If just heating some water fot coffee or tea is the extent of use then this kettle will do the trick."
3,PICKING UP THE PACE,"I like the album,It seems Bon Jovi are returning to rock as opposed to blues like sound they were producing previous.I think the guys need to add more crunch and grind to their guitars.It sounded like they were headed in that direction with this album.I hope on their next album it will be more like their first 3 albums lyric and soundwise just a little heavier.If the guys in the band happen to read this,I hope you don't take offense or think I'm running the band down because I am a fan and hope you consider every fans opinion.I would like to see a album with lyrics and beats like runaway or livin on a prayer instead of blues like story telling.You guys are great and I hope you'll keep rockin!!!"
5,Crush Review,I love this group and this CD is great. I saw them in concert in April and it was awesome.
3,"More Rock, less ballads","First, let me preface this by saying I love Bon Jovi, and I'm thrilled that after all this time they have released a new cd. However, where is the rock? Outside of the first and the last songs on the album, the rest are pretty slow and mellow. Now, don't get me wrong, I like Jovi ballads, but I want some more rockers too..."
3,better than there last one,crush is not there best cd but it a whole lot better that there last one these days. these days is so sad crush has there 80s sound on it. its my life sounds like living one a prayer one wild night sound like wild in the street . crush it good but could have be better
2,Why goin`back?,"This record is a big disappoitment after the well-crafted songwriting of ""These days"".You would have expected them at their age to deliver better work.Even the productions sounds very thin and the lyrics are among the worst i ever heard(""one wild night"",the rock cliche itself,""my heart is like an open highway"", aah..yes).Songs like ""Shes a mistery""sound so boring like B-sides.Best avoided!"
1,Is Bon Jovi overrated?,"After the deceiving Destination Anywhere, I told myself that I'd give them one more chance. Well, they blew it. I consider myself a big fan. I have all of what they did (including some singles and importations). For the first time in my life, I brought a CD back to the store. Though It's My Life sounds quite good (after a few listenings), the rest of the album is totally empty. There's no musical dynamism at all. I'm thinking to myself that maybe the guys should go different ways, there doesn't seem to be any fuel left..."
3,"The magic's there, just slightly hidden","While this album is not ""really"" a Bon Jovi album, it comes pretty close to being one. Why? The first track seems to me to have been directed at mainstream music - which hasn't really been Bon Jovi's style. That song doesn't stick out enough. It doesn't come up to classics like ""Always"" and ""Wild in the Streets"" and even ""This Ain't a Love Song"" You don't hear ""It's My Life"" and go, man that's fantastic, play it again. I think the rest of the album is pretty cool, though. Throughout it seems to me that they're incorporating a lot of different sounds - quite a few pieces sound like Sambora's solo work, and a few like some of Bryan's solo work. Which in a whole sense comes down to being a broader Bon Jovi sound. While I still believe that ""Slippery When Wet"" and ""These Days"" are thus far the best BJ albums, I'd still recommend getting this one."
4,They're back!,Awesome CD. Really liked the sound of it. Reminds me of the old BJ day's but still has a new sound to it. True blue BJ fan's will love it
3,Good but not great,"This book was a quick read, chronicling the exploits of six treasure hunters and their efforts to recover some of the billions of dollars worth of treasure sitting at the bottom of the oceans. Although the accounts were interesting, I would have preferred a bit more historical context of the ships they were searching, along more post-find follow up (ex, more information on where the treasure ended up, etc). I also found that the inforamtion on all of the stories was presented the same way -- the way the story was built up all the way to the discovery of treasure became very anti-climatic after the 4th or 5th example. It's also fun to discover the words that are spelled incorrectly."
4,Nice trees,"These are very nice trees that work extremely well. Why didn't I give a final star? I save that for the old Britain's Limited trees made of individual branches attached by fitting one part of the leaf cluster over the branch nub. Those trees were perfect. These are a very workable, modern day replacement. We will never see trees that are like the old Britain's Ltd ones for a price we can afford. So buy these; you will be happy."
2,"Good explanations, but bias abounds.","Starting on page 97, the book talks about the ""We don't ban cars"" argument in regards to the gun control debate. The authors call this a questionable analogy because ""Handguns serve few legitimate purposes in private hands; AK-47s and the like, none at all; restricting their use would make relatively little difference in most of our lives.""In addition, solutions for the end-of-chapter exercises had no given solutions, making it difficult for study in a politics class like the one I'm taking with this book.While the book is an enjoyable read, the biases of the authors leave a bad aftertaste, leading me to only give the book two stars instead of what would be maybe four. For casual readers who aren't using this as a textbook, I'm sure that better books are out there."
4,Cliff's review,It would have helped to state that Tommy Hilfiger's shoe sizes run a bit large. I always order size 11 1/2 and the shoe is a bit larger than other shoes I have bought or ordered. Other than that the shoes are well made and are comfortable
3,You can't go home again.,"I saw this movie when it first came out, I think it was 1979. I loved it! It was a bit slower than I remembered. The reason I bought it was for the songs by Burton Cummings. I actually wanted to buy the soundtrack but could not find it. It is romantic, but takes too long getting to the point."
4,Get it for less,One of my favorite films of all time. Jimmy Webb's music fits so well with this love story. You can find it for less at WB dot com.
3,Blast from the past sushi,"The photos in this book are probably the best thing about it, considering that it was written in 1981! It's just a wee little sushi primer and still has some relevance today, though there are much better books currently available. The photos at least are excellent and mouthwatering. The illustrations on how to teach you how to make sushi are bizarre and nearly indecipherable. This book is so old it was TYPESET!"
2,sumerian grammar dietz edzard,"the horror of this book is the latin alphabet in constant use, not a graph, image in cuneiforme or sumerian, it blabbers about a lot of charming expressions, but misses the idea of reading in the original. wanted to return it, but choose, idle to keep it, and shall never buy a book which cannot be opened, better go to a flea market, or buy from thieves, at least some will guess what a reader wishes to obtain, bye monster of the wild. will try another book. hayim bn shadmon"
3,"Different yes, Awsome yes!","Apartment 26 is such a different sound then im used to. Its like jazzy rock with scremo, its kinda wierd like nothing else (especially give me more). Nevertheless it is a good cd, the songs on this are so much different from the next song, the songs that i like are strike, stupid world has to be one of the worst beginnings to a song and the following 2 songs are just to jazzy for me. Continuing on New Years Resolution, and Kick to the head are great great songs. Followed by one of the worst songs summer.The only thing that I can think of is like a rollercoaster ride. some ups and some downs over and over. Its an alright cd, but theres only three songs that stand out to me, the others are garbage."
3,2.5 stars....,Well I only got this cd because it was very cheap. But i should have saved my money. This is alright but nothing worth listening to again. Blah kinda boring to me.
4,A fascinating hybrid of organic and electronic textures,"Flanger find the middle ground between the classic-jazz textures of Amon Tobin and the twitchy, molecular electronic emissions of Oval and Pole. The rhythms aren't bracing; languid would be a better word. A solid, innovative record in a genre that is sounding increasingly homogenous."
4,a fascinating story,Maybe isn't it the most none story of G. Greene but this is a real intresting. He desribe Cuba before the revolution with a great talent and give an idea of the hidden World of the secret agent.
5,My favourite Greene novel.,"This book is one of Greene's lighter novels and is also one that is very easy to read. Having said that, with all the tension, humidity and fog of daquiris at lunch time, it still has the very distinct and heavy atmosphere that is present in all of his books.Based on Greene's extensive experiances of double-agents and British intelligence, the book has a wonderful plot and an exciting pace. The confused and likeable central character Wormwold, creating information and sub-agents, is one of Greene's finest. This is my favourite Graham Greene novel."
1,horrible package design,"I'd love to tell you about this soup, but most of the noodles slipped right past the flimsy lid while draining. I'm sure it can be done if I hold the lid at the very end, but that's where the hot water comes out. If the manufacturer can't bother to make a usable package, I can't bother with the product. Too bad there is no '0' option."
1,Abysmal Instant Soup,"I'm surprised by the good reviews for this product; this is the worst instant soup mix I have ever had. I am including such awful foods as ramen and lipton instant soup.The broth is completely flavorless and couldn't be saved even with the addition of siracha. The noodles have a weird taste to them, although I would not be offended by the gummy quality, the overall effect is disgusting $3 instant soup.Stick to top ramen!"
4,They're not kidding - it really does work!,Probably the most cheesy and DIY video that I have ever seen - but by golly - it really does work!I was somewhat sekptical after reading some of the other reviews. Aplogies to the writers of those reviews - but the sounded a bit sugar coated and I suspected that they might have been written by relatives of Judith Oliver.But this does actually work. It won't return your skin to youthfull elasticity - nothing can do that - but toning the muscles fills out the wrinkles beautifully and it does change the shape of your face a little. It's kind of like botox but with the added advantgage that you can still move the muscles (botox just freezes them) so you still have your full range of facial expressions.So I can thoroughy recommend Ms. Oliver to everyone - and it is - how they say 'competitively priced' so you don't have a lot to loose.
5,"Every once in a while, you find a gem.","This is one of them. Every page is filled with peace and wisdom. I found this book, of course, ""by accident"" (that is, by the grace of God) just at the time my extraordinarily holy Catholic parish priest and spiritual director was discerning whether or not to become a Benedictine monk. This book will deepen my life, i'm sure of it. A good companion book, at least for me, is Jean-Pierre de Caussade's ""Abandonment to Divine Providence."""
2,A clutter of images and ideas.,"Clive Barker needs to learn how to pace himself before taking on such a large novel.Even though the story line of The Great and Secret Show is fairly collected and in order,the way he goes about telling the story is not.I found the book very interesting at times but for the most part i felt i was just continuing to read the book so i could actually finish it and start on another.I would personally recommend the Damnation Game or Weaveworld over this fairly intersting but otherwise average book."
5,BEYOND HELL,i think this is one of the best cd's put out by gwar! great intensity to the songs. still maintains that sense of humor that i look for with gwar. love the instrumental aspects to the music arrangements.make sure you see them in concert! a must see.
5,GWAR - Beyond Hell,"This one of Gwar's best album's with only ""Scumdogs of the Universe"" and ""War Party"" that match up, OCCASIONALLY Gwar will produce an album that is on the point of addiction, turn the volume up and sit back and listen the album seems to pass in no time.The album covers Gwar's trip through hell with the new character ""Jitler"" half Jesus half Hitler, on this album you also get the cover of ""School's Out"" which brought it to a new generation, just remember the album is hard and heavy and worth every penny, especially look out for ""Destroyed"",""The Ultimate Bohab"", ""He is the One who will not be named"", ""Go to Hell"" and probably the best song on the album ""Tormentor"".This is a must have album for any metal fan a Brilliant follow up to ""War Party"" I see this as Gwar's music growing into the 21 century keeping the music as heavy and quick as any other band. Become a member of ""BOHAB CENTRAL"" to learn all about Gwar"
1,Don't bother,I had put a lot of hope on this product and was let down.I followed the directions on the bottle and applied the product on a Saturday. That following Monday I discovered a rattlesnake in the yard.
1,This product does not work with Windows XP,I purchased this product in November 2001. The only part of the software package that was usable was the Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE. Then I became even more disappointed when I tried to find the KB Gear website. It's owned by someone else who apparently has no interest in the product or its being updated. Also called the 800 number and it came up disconnected! GOOD LUCK!
5,Great Product,This Salad Shooter is just what we wanted. It is powerful to do whatever we need it to do. We love it!!
5,Presto Professional Salad Shooter,We had the original salad shooter and when it came time to replace it we bought the Professional model and have found it excellent to use.Lori
3,Suuuuuuuuuuper loud.,"Well, it shreds cheese like it's supposed to so that's a plus.It's incredibly loud. And it can make a big mess since the cheese just kind of flys about. You'll have to stop and clear the tunnel if you're grating a lot otherwise it'll get mushed into a big ball of cheese. And, it wont grate all the cheese... you'll find a nice slice once you tear it all apart to clean... I don't mind that part as much because I just eat it. It's like it's rewarding me for using it to grate my cheese."
5,Awesome product,I just received my Pro. salad shooter today and let me tell you it is awesome. Very quick and very easy clean up. I am impressed!!! A must have for any kitchen.
3,NOISY,"It does a great job grating cheese, but boy is it NOISY. It's the equivalent of scratching nails on a chalk board and a hair dryer combined. It does it's job, but VERY noticeably... Prepare your grated cheese before your guests arrive..."
3,would prefer something better made,"Whenever I have used this, I wear ear plugs. And if my housemate uses it, I leave the kitchen.It emits a high-pitched sound that hurts my ears, and it smells like something is over-heating.So far thought, it's done the job and doesn't seem the worse for wear. I haven't seen any other product to compare it to..."
5,Better than I ever thought!,"So I was originally turned onto this product by a friend who has a presto salad shooter from 20 years ago...still going strong for her today. I had looked at it and decided that I would go for a kitchen aid attachment instead, due to the small storage space we have for our kitchen. However, after reading all the reviews about the kitchen aid shredder attachment, I read the reviews for the presto and found that more people had success and long term enjoyment out of the salad shooter. I thought, what the heck, so I bought the salad shooter and I LOVE IT!!! It is perfect and does NOT take up any more room than the shredder attachment would have....plus it is fast and I mean FAST!!! Not enough love can be expressed for this product! If you have to buy a machine for shredding or chopping...this is your best bet...and it is easy to clean...enjoy! I know I am!"
5,Salad shooter,This is great. Larger than my old one.Works great and is quick at cutting potatoes and slaw. It is better than a food processor.
2,Sounds like a Jet Engine that shoots Salad,"This device does what it says. It shoots salad well but it sounds like a jet engine. If you like a quiet kitchen, this engine will not fit well in your yours."
3,Easy to get bored of...,"I used a lot in the first week, but now it's only occasional. I did make shredded carrots today that cost $2 less that the bag my roommate bought. I'm in a big salad mood this week so my usage for cucumbers, carrots, lettuce and eggs today will be worth it and save some $$, but then it will sit for a month"
5,there is nothing like a salad shooter!!!,There is nothing like a salad shooter in the kitchen! I have literally worn out two salad shooters before. One I had for years and years and used it 3 or 4 times a week. It is the best for slaw or grading cheese. When I purchased this last one I got one for my son who had moved out to his own home and was always borrowing mine! I can't imagine not having a salad shooter and I hope they never stop making them .
5,Great for ginger,"Using this is the easiest way I've found to grate ginger. Just freeze the ginger and put it through (there's no need to skin it first even: most of the outside part of the ginger gets stuck in sheets and doesn't go through).After years of doing this it did break eventually when it got clogged though, so be careful."
4,Bigger than I expected,"I lost my salad shooter in Hurricane Katrina . I missed it so much. I looked around the different store to see if I could replace it with out any success. Finally I ordered it on line. It is not what I had before ,this is much larger and not as easy to handle but it does do a great job."
4,"works great, but need earplugs!","I bought this to use in my restaurant for one purpose.. shreding cheese. We go through about 20# of shredded swiss and provolone a week, which isn't a ton, so i didn't want to invest a ton in something to do the work.. We used to just use a large hand shredder, but the cooks were starting to cry... This thing pumps out 10# in about 15 minutes, but if the cook does it during business hours, all the customers probably think Dr. Frankenstien is making a monster in the kitchen. It sounds like the motor is dying, but that is the way it sounded from day one, and it's not from forcing it too much either. Been using it for a couple months now, and still going strong... If i get over a year out of it, i'll be happy. stay tuned."
1,Salad Shooter,"It didn't Shoot - but instead, the salad stuff just built up on the inside. I returned this product and am using my Cuisinart instead."
1,WONT CUT AND COMES OUT MUSHY,"THIS WAS THE MOST REGRETING PURCHASE I HAVE EVER BOUGHT! IT WONT CUT RIGHT, YOU CANT CUT ONIONS OR TOMATOS! IT COMES OUT MUSHY!"
5,A pillow for the soul,"Nothing can make a difference in your life like change does. It's the REAL ""freshmaker."" This book will help you convert your Earth into a peaceful Heaven."
5,Listening closely brings joy to our own existence,"Elizabeth Falconer called it a ""daunting yet exhilirating adventure"" to compose music for seven paintings featured at a Seattle Asian Art Museum exhibit. The CD's jacket shows the artwork, and one can see Falconer's inspiration for each composition. Listening closely brings joy to our own existence. ""Deep Pool"" further allows us to formulate our own imagery and associations, and, in doing so, you become part of the koto master's creative process. (Joe Ross, Roseburg, OR.)"
5,Choosing Simplicity: Real People Finding Peace and Fulfillment in a Complex World,This is a book that doesn't insult you by demanding that you do things a certain way. Some people might need or like to be told to do exact steps so maybe if you're that type then this book isn't for you. The examples truly illustrate how transformed lives can help you determine your own path into simplicity. It's something we don't have to demand of ourselves. It's more like finding an inner healing power that coaxes you into examining the truth about yourself and how to find inner peace on how you truly want to live happily and stressfree.
4,Bon Jovi *Bounces* Back!,"Anyone who is a hardcore Bon Jovi fan or maybe just getting into the Bon Jovi scene will love this album! Again it hits with the theme of the Underdog coming out on top, and it also stresses the importance of never forgetting what happened on 9/11 with the first two songs 'Undivided' and 'Everday.' So to make a long story short, this album is in my opinion the best Bon Jovi album yet!Bon Jovi Forever!!"
5,Bounce *Bon Jovi*,"Bon Jovi's Bounce is one of the best albums to come along in awhile. With songs dedicated to 9/11 to great motivating songs, such as BOUNCE (track 11), the CD rocks from start to finish! But then again. . . we expect nothing less from Bon Jovi!!!"
1,not bon.jovi sorry,i liked 80s bonjovi but not the new stuff. the 80s songwriting was the best for this band.
4,Bounce,"Never a disappointing album from the boys of Jersey. This album starts off with a great song ""Undivided"", this song both musically and lyrically is excellant. There was musically a lot more hard core stuff going on, lyrically however it was softer. The song ""Bounce"" is just a good old fun Bon Jovi song. The Bon Jovi roots are there with some modern sounding Matchbox20 like music mixed in. A definate buy. Barbara Cestaro"
4,Just fine!,"This is a solid rock and roll CD. I enjoyed it a lot. There are 3 or 4 really nice songs plus an awesome track called ""Love Me Back to Life"". I hope they release it as a single cause its really the best piece in the album but somehow I think they will fall for the seudo-patriotic themes, which are also good, don't take me wrong."
5,AN ALBUM TO OWN,"This album is great!! Bon Jovi has done it again, with such great songs as Everyday & Bounce. There is also some songs which relate to September 11th which are inspirational. Bon Jovi keeps getting better with time. Also some great guitar work by Richie Sambora like with the song ""Hook Me Up"". What a great band!"
4,Another great one from the best - Bon Jovi!,"I've been a Bon Jovi fan for the past 18 years and they have never disappointed me. This time is no exception! ""Bounce"" is a great CD and brings the band back to what they do best - hard driving rock and roll with some amazing guitar riffs!! From the first strains of ""Undivided"" you know the boys from Jersey are going to take you on a wild and wonderful musical romp! ""Distance"" and ""Everyday"" are other great rockers. I was a bit disappointed by songs like ""Joey"" and some of the ballads however. The high energy rockers are definitely the best, but overall it's still destined to be a classic! Whether you are a long-time fan or new to Bon Jovi, you'll love this CD! RUN, don't walk, to get this new one - you won't regret it."
2,run of the mill,"Bon Jovi were catchy back in the 80's for a minute&then found a formula that worked&haven't broken free of it.that is what you get here.well placed Pop Radio Format Songs that will work alright on a Car Ride but whatever you do don't pull over to the side too listen to them.this Album has all the CLiche Bon Jovi Tricks:Power Chords,Ballads&whatnot that cover their usual territory.in other words once you have heard one Bon Jovi Album you have heard them all.the difference being that back in the mid 80's that at least two decent songs now you have to listen to find a decent Hook to half-way enjoy.I give them Two for mainly staying the Game&Surviving not so much with there Formula for Success."
5,excellent,"bon jovi did it again.you can always expect an excellent album from this band.. bounce is an exceptional album.. all the songs are great.... misunderstood, joey, bounce , hook me up, everyday,..just to name a few ..are all very good songs. cant wait to see the boys in jersey this february..."
3,Worth buying for the single...but not much else.,"I was disappointed by this, especially after Crush. It's not their strongest album by far, but I did enjoy a couple of the tracks. The title track is worth a listen, if nothing else.Bon Jovi is a great studio band, but I feel like in recent years their albums have been weakening in favor of an extremely strong stage show. They're incredible live. The studio performances sound over-produced, while the raw and charismatic onstage versions of the same songs are simply amazing."
5,UNDIVIDED ATTENTION,"Bounce is absolutely fantastic. Not one song on the CD that does not grow on you immediately.""Undivided"" will make the hair on your arms stand. Highly recommend this CD you will not be disappointed!! Classic Bon Jovi!! Better Than ever"
3,A NICE ALBUM,"THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING BUT JUST NICE. I HEARD MUCH BETEAR BON JOVI IN THE PAST , THERE IS A FEW VERY GOOD SONGS IN HERE BUTI HEARD SOME SONGS THAT I JUST COULDNT HAER FROM THE START TO THE FINISH . SO I CANT TELL YOU BUY THIS ALBUM.BUT ALL THE FANTIC FANS COULD LOVE THIS , BUT AGAIN ITS NOT FOR EVRYONE"
5,laughing out loud,"After a crummy day I can always depend on ""Scrubs"" to make me laugh out loud. LOVE this show. I will eventually get all the seasons because I can watch them again and again."
1,Not a very good deal,"Scrubs is a funny and popular show I admit - and my 17 yr old son LOVES it! I bought him the 1st and 2nd seasons so far and looked here on Amazon to get him the 3rd season but good thing I checked Best Buy too. Season 3 - brand new at Best Buy is listed as $24.99 right now. Even if I bought Scrubs Season 3 used on Amazon, I would pay more with shipping than the new one at Best Buy. Does that make any sense? Guess it does pay to ""shop around"". Good Luck Shopping!"
1,Lemon DVD,This DVD did not work. The first disc would not progress past the standard movie warnings at the beginning. We sent it back and received a replacement set that also did not work. Same problem. I would avoid ordering this set.
5,Neck pain gone,"My chiropractor recommened this item and it is worth every penny I spent. The traction relieved the tight, turtle neck I was experiencing. The pain running down my shoulders has gone. Neck muscles sore from use, but that is to be expected when using this item. Well worth it."
3,definately the HISTORY of disco,THIS WAS SOME HARD READING. I LOVE THE DISCO ERA. THIS BOOK HAS VERY SPECIFIC INFORMATION WITH VERY DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF HAPPENINGS THAT LED UP TO THE DISCO ERA. I FELT LIKE I WAS READING A HISTORY BOOK BACK IN SCHOOL INSTEAD OF AN INTERESTING FUN FILLED ACCOUNT OF WHO WAS DOING WHAT. IF YOU WANT STRAIGHT UP FACTS THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU...IF YOU ARE MORE INTO JUICY STORIES OF WHO WAS DOING WHAT AND TO WHOM LIKE AT STUDIO 54 DONT WASTE YOU TIME.
4,I recomend this book to all.,"I believe this was a great book overall. However I do think that the vocabulary in this book was a little over my head. I believe this book was wriiten for a younger audience, and with the words that Carrol chose to use it would be hard to understand. Once you pass over the vocab you will enjoy the book."
5,Work great!,These headphones work in our suburban and even my 3 year old finds them comfortable. I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat!
2,Almost Horrible,"4.5 stars people? Really? I rate movies according to logic and comparatively to other movies. So a 4 or 5 star rating is on the level of Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Titanic, and the likes...movies that are worthy of Academy Awards.Needless to say, Renegades doesn't meet that criteria.It's a hopelessly bad ""buddy"" movie with cheesy acting, a fairly lame story, with some action mixed in.The brilliant ""roll your eyes"" moment was when the Indian elder heals Sutherland from a gunshot wound.Don't expect anything and if you're into pretty bad cop movies, you might like it. Otherwise just steer clear."
2,"Robert Ludlum's ""The Paris Option""","I found this book to be the least interesting of the three ""Covert One"" novels with Robert Ludlum's name on them. I found it to be quite difficult to keep from throwing it in the round file before I finished it. I did give it a two star rating because it did keep my interest albeit boring. I think Robert Ludlum's name should not be on any book not authored by him. Now that this great mystery writer is dead, publishers should not be allowed to use his name to sell books. If his name had not been on the cover of the book, I would not have purchased it. I assume that he had made outlines of the three Covert One novels before he died and the co-authors went from there. This particular one should have been in the Science Fiction section of the bookstore instead of the Mystery Section."
2,This is bad,"Reading it now, it's not clasic Ludlum, it's a bad movie screen play. It's over written and you'll get tired of the very poor lanuage and descriptions that are repetive. How many time do we need to be reminened that they are looking for a DNA molecular computer or that Jon Smith uses an encrypted cell phone? Pick something else..."
4,A no-stop entertaining thriller,"I finally bought my first Ludlum book, it ended up to be written by Lynds but it's no problem.. she's got skills. What I love about this book is the rhythm, it's so fast, the story is very entertaining, it's all about action and the characters are good. But on one thing I have to agree with the critics: the whole DNA computer story is non-sense, this supercomputer it's more fantasy than anything that could be real in the future.Now I'm going to continue the Covert-One series and off course the Ludlum's classics."
5,The Paris Conspiracy,"THE SETUPEmile Chambord, a French scientist has developed a DNA-based computer, with the help of Aspberger-syndrome afflicted Marty Zellerbach. The lab explodes, presumably killing Chambord and leaving Marty in a coma. Coincidentally, John Smith (Marty's childhood friend), the antagonist, a medical doctor and U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, is also working on DNA-based computers. Smith happens to be an agent for Covert One (essentially the U.S. President private espionage agency) and is sent to investigate. He is ultimately joined by his almost-sister-inlaw CIA agent Randi Russell and semi-retired MI-6 agent Peter Howell. Thats the setup.CRITIQUEAlthough some of the premises strain credulity, these are easily forgiven in the spirit of ""suspension of disbelief"".VERDICT""The Paris Option"" is an unrelentingly fast-paced, captivating suspense novel filled with intrigue and populated by interesting characters. A page turner which keeps you on the edge of your seat."
4,Good read,"I really enjoyed reading this little book. It seems more like a manuscript than a real text book. Maybe that's how Sun Tzu intended the book to read like.The only thing I did not like from this book is that there is no annotations whatsoever. Overall though it is a good read and I think it can help people in many situations in life (business, relationships, job, etc)"
3,Practical in some ways,"The Art of War was interesting when you think about how old this book is and see the different tactics discussed in it. I have heard many times too, that this is a good read for people in the business world today. I agree with that in part. There are parts of the book that are translatable to the business world but a lot that are not.Overall it is a very short book. I'm glad I finally read it, but not one I was blown away by."
4,Amazong book; Great translation,"A great book, for anyone who is interested in the art of strategy war combat. A great translation, some mildly confusing phrases, but easily rectified. Highly recommend this version."
3,RON SILVER'S NARRATION IS SLEEP INDUCING,"Yes, Ron Silver has a fine voice when he wants to. But I find this audio book of Sun Tzu's The Art of War disappointing. There are actually several narrators, but Ron Silver does perhaps 70%+ of the narration. There is a stark contrast between his speech and the other narrators whenever the switch takes place.Ron Silver speaks this text in a very low, monotonous way that puts me to sleep. He seems to have put on his ""ancient Chinese philosophy"" wise man hat, and speaks in a low, soft drone. Doesn't work at all for me.The content is great, but Silver's narration is soporofic. IMO."
4,"Simple, but Shrewd","The first 60 pages of the book is the translation by Lionel Giles. The remainder of the book is the Lionel Giles' translation with various commentary. I never skim through a book before reading. I wish I had with this book, because I would have felt better off reading the translation with commentary alone.Much of Sun Tzu's observations on war are common sense. But if everyone shared common sense alike, all wars would come to stalemates.I can see in the future that this will be a book I will reference often. I couldn't help but think about modern day warfare being a protracted and expensive venture. Warfare has become a business. A business that will surely wear upon citizens and infantrymen. Perhaps, the Carroll Quigley's of the world, who believe in the need for perpetual warfare, would do well by an ""Art of War"" refresher course."
4,The Art of War,"The Art of WAR IS A QUICK READ BUT A MORE DIFFICULT STUDY. MY GOAL WAS TO FIND PARALLELS IN THE BOOK THAT I COULD RELATE TO BUSINESS AND PLEASURE. I FIND MYSELF REREADING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TO SEE IF THERE IS A STRATEGY TO A CURRENT LIFE CHALLENGE. SOMETIMES THERE IS, MORE OFTEN I DO NOT FIND THE STRATEGY. THAT IS WHEN I USE TRUE LIFE EXPERIENCES. I WILL MOST LIKELY READ IT SEVER MORE TIMES DURING THE COMING YEAR."
4,Classic and Entertaining Book on Winning Life,"A remarkable military treatise, Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" maintains its relevancy millennia after its publication. Despite many antiquated sections involving ancient warfare, e.g. Chapter 12: Attacking by Fire, most of Sun Tzu's ideology reverberates through to today. Anyone wishing to learn something about leading others to victory, whether in corporate, political, or personal battles, can walk away with something from this book. From skillful manipulation and deceit in battle to learning how to invade a foreign fortress, ""The Art of War"" covers it all. I would recommend this book to anyone.As far as the physical book itself goes, my order came in with the paperback binding slightly frayed. I'm not sure whether it happened in shipping or at warehouse, but it was rather disappointing, seeing it come in non-mint condition, that is.+5 for content-1 for condition on arrival"
1,Buy it used and locally,"I was unhappy that the book cost 3.99 and the shipping was over $11. The order says I chose the ""quicker"" shipping, and I did not. I could have purchased this at a local used bookstore for the same price or lower and save the 3x more cost. I will not purchase from Amazon again."
1,Stopped working,This went from super loud to broke in a matter of 3 days. This product blows harder than a humback whale coming to the surface after hours under the water.
5,Women of Substance,"The women in this book were many faceted. They were wives, mothers, grandmother, help-mates for their husbands as well as leading their own lives, in some instances. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and it was interesting learning how each of them reacted to the pitfalls and high points in each of their lives, how they interacted with each other as well as with those family members that were either supporters or detractors, and how their attitudes about life shaped the lives of their children and grandchildren. If you love history, and especially the Roosevelt family history, this is a must read."
4,An egocentric eccentric's Christmas bash,"Very entertaining mystery that takes place in a wealthy eccentric's enormous home. Troy Alleyn has been commissioned to paint Hilary (a man) Bill-Tasman's portrait during the Christmas holiday. While she knows that he's eccentric, she doesn't count on the fact that he likes to staff his house with ex-convicts (""onecers"")from the local prison. When their crimes start repeating themselves in the great house and a missing person turns up dead, Inspector Alleyn is unwillingly pulled into the picture, taking charge of the investigation. I would have ranked the book higher, except that the identity of the murderer became fairly clear a little too early."
3,Vintage TV,"This PBS production, filmed decades ago in black and white, is based on the famous Richard Wright short story ""The Man Who Was Almost a Man."" The narrative follows the story closely, and the production deserves praise for its fidelity to Wright's themes. The setting is naturalistic. Dave's home looks like a sharecropper's shack, not a Hollywood conception of one.The cast give solid performances though I have an issue with LeVar Burton's portrayal of Dave. The character seems five-year-old as he pretends to shoot an imaginary gun. Okay, Wright's character is immature. But he's not developmentally disabled.The film stock used to make the DVD is somewhat degraded, so it's disappointing as a visual experience."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Ultimate X-Men will just never be for me, I am afraid. I understand whythey are doing it, and it is has obviously been successful, buteventually they will run into the same problems and reasons for doingthis universe. What will they do then, the same thing? A bit of themanga art style here, too, that I am usually not a fan of whenhybridised like this, and a crossover Japanese writer, as well."
2,awful.,"this is a god awful movie. it has the feel of a cult classic, but doesn't have the edge, humor, etc. that makes a cult classic a cult classic."
2,Cheesy and does not play consistently,"I was in an antique store and heard the most amazing music. I was told it was an old record of Domenico Modugno. I was excited to find him on Amazon. However this ""record"" is over-produced and sounds like a cheesy restaurant singer. I finally discovered that after the CD randomly decided to play after two weeks of unsuccessful attempts. Boo."
2,Speaker Failure,"Loved these speakers while they lasted, although they did really eat up the batteries. The sound was excellent for such a small unit. The problem is that the lone wire (connector) developed a loose wire or some other circuit malfunction so that now the speakers are useless. When I attach them to my mp3 player I get constant static and the sound breaks up. I tried several other mp3 players. The result was the same. Too bad."
1,horrible,"I'm gonna start this review by saying, I'm a Nirvana fanatic. I purchased this shirt last year, and was doing some christmas shopping this year and ran across it again. I wore this shirt probably twice, firstly, the fabric is really thick and got all stretched out and misshaped after only wearing it twice. I hate this shirt. I have a few other nirvana t's that are much, much better made then this one. In fact I've had them for about 6 years and they still look nice."
3,Useful,"Some good information here but some of it has been outdated, particularly with the research by Kathryn Watts (safergrass.org) - that free choice hay herein recommended may be making things worse. Other information pertinent to the discussion is alluded to but you have to pay again for this as it is in other publications by the same author."
4,I recommend it!,"Shake it as much as you want upside down, so spills! Little children who are used to breastfeeding or bottles won't be so traumatized from the transmission to this bottle: sippy tip works like a bottle's nipple but doesn't cause a tooth decay as a bottle would. My 8 months old liked to try apple juice from Playskool Bbay Feed'n Fun suppy cup. Why 4 stars not 5? I wish it was 10 oz! So 4+"
4,good,"well here is a cartoon that is a little too american/patriotic for its own good, but it was a time when we all looked up to heros and love that they could defeat anything and anyone.i just dont like the order that the episodes play out i mean sometimes there is a character in the series that has been with rambo for example say a whole dvd and suddenly dvd 2 that character presents it self as they have never meet before thats just confusing specially if u are a kid watching this,but it was probably how it was writen back in the 80s so the are forgiven however i have all dvds of rambo and since the dont playout in the order i want it im not sure what the last episode is plus im pretty sure im missing a couple of episodes and i have duplicate episodes also, so minus for that.but still since i like this show i recomend to all that are in to action and classic good guys vs bad guys its a must to see"
1,TERRIBLE-BORING!,"prince of persia has some of the worst graphics ive seen on DC. Every room in the game is almost exactly the same thing. there is no action. you walk around and try to get to the next room. Try buying Skies of Arcadia(best game ever), sonic or anything other than this."
5,Wonderful quality French soap,"I have tried the Cucumber, Fig and Sea scented soaps. They have all been long-lasting and smell fabulous. This is a wonderful product!"
4,Fun to play ...,"Normally I wouldn't get the ""HALO-3 Legendary Edition"", but since it was on sale for the same price as the deluxe edition, ... :)In the end the helmet is definitely for HALO fans, ... it's a cheap piece of plastic made in China, which is not even wearable.Having said that ... Fans will enjoy having it ...!As for game play and graphics; I actually expected something more of the quality level of graphics as seen in Half-Life and Unreal Tournament, but the graphics is nice none the less. As for game play; those of you who are Half-Life or Unreal tournament fans - this game will be a little disappointing. Limited interaction with objects makes it feel ""less advanced"". Going through the levels, I have a strong feeling that this is almost like a cheap copy of what Half-Life is about. Even the bad ""alien"" like levels (at the end, Half-Life has the same flaw).However, after playing it for a while, I can say that I did enjoy the game, but can't wait for the next Episode of Half-Life though."
1,NO HELMET,"I ordered what I thought included the halo helmet, I did not need the game I was sent. Not paying close attention this only included the video game. Too pissed off to send the game back I will gamestop it tomorrow. Beware and read descriptions as I did not, I cant see many people wanting this old game without the perks, still it can fool others like it did me! Do not buy if you think the mask is included."
4,story a little short,"this was a pretty short halo episode, but it's a sweet online game. the legendary edition extras are well worth the extra cash"
5,It works! Outstanding book,"This book is easy to understand, easy to put into practice. I was trying to get pregnant in my late 30's and was able to do so within 3 months. After the birth of my first child I waited a couple of years before trying again. By now I was 41. Again I got pregnant within 3 months. All my friends around my age were going crazy taking hormone shots and doing in vitro. Of course, it could be that I am a very fertile person. However, even at that, at the age I was, I did not have any time to waste! So I do credit this book for giving me the right information so I could be get pregnant naturally within the shortest possible time frame. If you have had trouble conceiving, I strongly recommend you try this natural method first before getting any expensive treatments."
5,"A do-it-yourself bible for anyone who is not ""One oftheGuys""","The language was raunchy, the characters real, the plot unique, and the ending exactly as I would have wanted life to be. Having worked with men in institutional settings, I was not surprised to find that they are the same everywhere. Mr. Young apparently had a front row seat to observe much of what he has written about, but he does it exceptionally well. Miles Derry is the personification of many of us, and he comes up smelling like a rose, to ultimately become ""One of the Guys"". Looking for your next book, Bob. This was an excellent read. END"
4,Solid for lap counting,"Bought this as a lap counter for when I run indoors. Fits in your palm perfectly, works well in that aspect. Only complainant would be that it feels cheap in your hands, but its held up so far. Not bad for the price"
4,Great counter!,"I purchased this counter to use when I'm training for races. It helps me keep track of how many laps I've run. It's sturdy, easy to use and reset. Would recommend this for anyone who needs to count anything!"
1,A con,"this was set for the american state... hence the fact i never actually watched and looking at the description, it never actually told me this. disappointed customer"
1,mystery.,"I normally like very much Bertolucci films. So I saw this film with great expectations. Sure, Liv Tyler is pretty and Jeremy Irons is attractive even if he was dying (in the story, of course). Some of us would like to see more than Tyler, however. I guess that I did not understand what was so particular about the theme or the synopsis. Even the gorgeous Tuscany looked a bit artificial in this artists' village. So were the personalities in the villege. What was this all about? was all I could say after seeing it."
4,Nice Atomic Clock for the bucks,"Would have posted 5-stars, BUT the instructions sucked. Had to call the 800 number to figure how to set everything.Also found out, I had to take it outside for 5-10 minutes so it could ""set itself"".Seems my metal roof interfered with the signal... One other thing, The ""inside temp"" is a couple of degrees lower that my other inside digital thermoter (which I know is correct)..."
3,Works well but glare,"Thes clocks work well. The downside is the glare, it's hard to see the time at an angle."
1,The Gallagher Chronicles - Discover the REAL Mike Gallagher,"On his daily talk show, Mike Gallagher says that he ""has no secrets."" Yet the BIGGEST secret of all - the one he wants nobody to find out about - wasn't even mentioned in Surrounded by Idiots. Find out why. Simply GOOGLE the words THE GALLAGHER CHRONICLES into your search engine and you'll discover a side of Mr. Gallagher that he does everything humanly possible to keep private."
5,A must read,"I have read this book several times, and each time, I find myself rediscovering the people and all of their relationships with each other. This is a wonderfully constructed, and well thought out story that will take hold of you until the very end. While it is a hard choice, this is my favorite Pilcher novel."
2,"Looks great, falls apart","Got this for Halloween. Normally I support my local costume shop but this was about $60 compared to $20 on Amazon, so we couldn't pass that up. Looks fantastic, just like in the pictures. But, the stitching came loose almost immediately and was not receptive to our efforts to fix it. If you want something to wear for one night, go for it. If you're looking for something to toss in the dress-up box for kids to use day in and day out, not such a great deal. That said, my kids still play with it."
5,Great costume piece!,This was a birthday gift for a child. It was a huge success! He loved it and plans to use it for Halloween also. It was slightly snug on his head so an adult size might be better for a kid with a slightly bigger head size.
4,A follow up with soul,"If you liked the first album, Innocent Eyes, you will be equally impressed with Mistaken Identity. She sings with such passion in each song, especially Be Strong, Last Night on Earth and Fragile. With all her ups (the Aria awards) and downs (being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and then succesfully completing treatment), these songs reflect all her emotions from the past year and a half. You will notice that these songs are a bit darker, lyrically, then the first album, but just as moving. Her style is a bit different as well, showing a more mature sound, but the songs still captivate your senses when you listen."
1,How dare you,"Uh, i think it is you who needs to get your facts right. See, you are just what i had explained, you are defending her because you want to protect her. Get over it, because she will never escape from bad things being said about her.The music is depressing, because it is about when she had cancer, and please correct me if i am wrong, but is having cancer depressing? I do not mean to show disrespect, but it is true. So please get a reality check. Find a brain too, while you are at it."
2,Really a book for academics and independent film buffs,"Five articles in this book proport to examine bisexual men in American culture and society. However, the majority of the books and films examined are not mainstream so really the essays can only be fully appreciated and understood by a small audience. Likewise, far too much time is really spent looking at bisexual women to justify the title ""Bisexual Men"". Only the last essay by Marshall Miller, ""Ethically Questionable?': Popular Media Reports of Bisexual Men and AIDS"" is truly accessible to most people and it does a great job of discussing cultural preceptions of bisexual men. What would be wonderful is a book that actually examined the mainstream of American culture and society."
3,A bias opinion,"I'm trying not t be too harsh because my review is going to be quite bias in the sense that I'm not really a Symphony X fan. I bought this album because I like bands such as 'Blind Guardian', 'Kamelot' and 'Stratovarius' but Symphony X didn't really do it for me. First there is the vocals which are rally hash and sound like something from a grunge band. Secondly, 'Evolution' and 'Communication and the Oracle' were OK but generally all the songs soud the same. Maybe I just can't handle loud banging music."
4,An excellent earlier effort from Symphony X,"Many fans who go way back with SX think this album is not among the band's strongest. But I really like it. Fallen is one of my favorite songs from this band on any album. The chrous melody absolutely won't leave my head. Fantastic stuff. It's true, the orchestration is electronic (not an actual string section). So it doesn't sound quite a big as it probably should have. This is a band on a budget though -- their ideas are definitely larger than their capabilities, at least in this time period. I put Odyssey and Paradise Lost ahead of V, but if you really liked those two albums there is enough here to appreciate."
3,I admire the effort,"and I truely do, this album's 6 years is showing its age. Particularly in the orchestral samples used to simulate said orchestra. Although not as bad as say an 80's Nintendo's Legend of Zelda MIDI orchestra, it still shows just how far one is able to achieve realism. I'd love to hear an actual update of this album in which the band contracted out some local orchestra and redid it. I think then it could really give something like Metallica S&M a run for its money. An enjoyable listen to nonetheless. However, if you're into this orchestral prog-metal, check out Therion, especially their ""Lemuria/Sirius B"" double-album. Therion's been doing this symphonic hybrid metal longer than anyone and it really shows in this great double-album."
4,Making Sense of Genius,"Kant is clearly one of the 4 or 5 most influential thinkers of the last half-century, however, the complexity of his ideas combined with an often difficult writing style (for modern readers) makes for a difficult study. In order to get the most out of Kant (or to get through him at all, for that matter), it is essential to read and study modern introductions and commentaries first. This ""very short introduction"" is an excellent example. It is concise, highly readable, and a good beginning for more detailed study. However, it is still not enough to allow one to tackle Kant immediately and I suggest further introductory study."
4,Giving us inspiration for the future of the community,"It's a struggle to find balance between ""progress"" and quality of life. It's also a struggle to retain our connections to the past and try to fit them into our lives today. In searching for some ""quick"" answers to how the museum I manage could answer some of these questions and how we can continue to be relevant to the community we serve, I read this book. It, of course, doesn't provide any quick solutions, but instead provides a heap of ideas and a strong philosophy to base activities & programs on. I read it as a museum professional, BUT found alot in it for my role as a community member. I'd definitely recommend the book for anyone interested in strengthening their community or finding common ground between community groups. The book does not read like a ""how to"" book. It's beautifully written, but still practical. A quick quote from the book: ""Remembering confirms our attachments to each other""."
5,Scary,"Excellent book. It goes back to the roots of central banking, WWI, WWII, the federal reserve, etc. It is a little dry, but very informative and well-written."
4,Money is the Dark Matter of the Universe,"Do you ever wonder how the financial system really works? What money is? Where it comes from? You'll find answers here. Just be careful to distinguish between historical fact and the author's opinions, the lines between which he intentionally blurs.I was fascinated enough to trudge through all 608 intense pages and have learned a lot. Griffin is not a great author but he is a good one and certainly capable enough to spice up the relatively dull subjects of wars, economic cycles and inflation with some of his documentary film-maker flair. At the very least I now think I understand how the US government is able to suddenly spend a billion dollars a day to wage war without it ever having been sitting around before. They can, after all, print the world's currency, and that, as you'll see, has enormous global consequences."
1,Watch something else,This is an implausable nasty movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I bought this on the recommendation of others and sincerely wonder if they watched this thing all the way through!
3,Suprisingly Good,I had not heard much about this movie. I knew that they were doing a big budget stop animation film that was coming out soon. I also knew that Gerard Butler was the star of 300 and he was playing Beowulf. I thought this would be a standard remake of classic literature. Instead I found it to be quite compelling and sometimes very funny. They told the tale with a bit of a twist showing Grendels side of the story and making him considerably more real and sympathetic. Gerard Butler was excellent as was the rest of the cast. Also the cinematography was just beautiful.It may not be for everybody but I didn't expect much and was pleasantly suprised.
2,I didn't like this movie.,I rented this movie at McDonalds for a $1 mainly because Gerard Butler was in it and boy was I disappointed in the action and story
3,Beowulf and Grendel,"I enjoy many different types of movies but this one appealed to me mainly because Gerard Butler was the lead. I really was not to impressed with the movie as far as its entertainment value goes but I did enjoy watching Gerard, he is an excellent actor. For his die hard fans a much better movie is 300."
3,"I had such high hopes, but.....","I was very excited to watch this movie, but it was slightly disappointing. The acting was not quite up to par, and the movie lacked the fantastic story-telling that I was hoping for. I'm definitely not sorry that I bought the movie, but it won't be one that I watch over and over. I usually watch a movie two or three times before my opinion is set in stone, so maybe this one deserves another viewing."
4,Satisfying,"Interesting twist on the oldest of the western tales. Well acted, beautifully shot. Icelandic locations add greatly to this film."
3,Missed by a swords width breath!,"Beowulf and Grendel had beautiful imagery with its locale shoot.Beowulf and Grendel had a fresh and good idea.Beowulf and Grendel starred Gerard Butler, who is going to become a huge star in the upcoming megamovie 300.But unfortunately, that's about all this movie has going for it.Slow and sometimes dismally boring, Beowulf and Grendel could have been a low budget classic if the script would have been better.But for fans who love this type of story and genre you have two saving graces coming to the big screen. The first is the March premiere of the ultra-cool 300 movie. This will make tons of cash, and make Gerard Butler a huge megastar.The 2nd is the upcoming huge flick by famed director, Robert Zemeckis called: Beowulf. I trust this awesome director to remake a classic story to state-of-the-art special effects and solid plot.Believe me, it will be big."
5,Beowulf and Grendel,"The cinematography of this movie, shot in Iceland, is breathtaking. The movie seems to capture the dreariness of the ""indoor life"" as I imagine it was while carrying us along an amazing viking adventure at the same time. This is a movie I have watched several times, purchased for my library and endlessly recommend to friends."
1,Lack of Action,"This film needed actual monsters and more fighting. I am not normally one to ask for action. I love character study films. However, when there is neither character study nor action nor motivation, a film drowns in its lostness. I was saddened that the writers got their history wrong. Most scholars believe that Beowulf's tale actually traces back to at least 200 BC. So, the cliche monk would not even exist in the original telling. The worst part of the film was that the characters all had different accents. This film is an incorrect account of Beowulf."
4,Well Done!,"I've read some reviews really bashing this film, but I'm with the majority here. It was really well done! The myth and magic is presented very subtly in the film. The locations where it was filmed are fantastic. It is the best and most entertaining rendition of Beowulf since '13th Warrior' and Hey! No Antonio to wrench the storyline. Very Cool....."
5,Beowulf and Grendel!,"Probably the real story in real life, but it is debatable from the starting premise. It is also very gritty, and true to the land (with actors actually suffering in making the movie), and that gives it it's realistic 'truth'. Well-acted, well-played, and well-presented! It will scare you, and you just might identify with some of the players, but that is always a danger, isn't it???"
2,Sci-Fi Movie with an actual Budget for Effects,"I see why this had mixed reviews and didn't make it to the American screens, the views of iceland were amazing however.The storyline plods along though and it makes you end up asking who cares about why Grendel is attacking these people and even less about the ""big secret"" at the end. Which is obvious if you don't fall asleep mid-way through.I was asking myself why the Polly actress, couldn't do some type of decent accent while in the movie.I am assuming she was a friend of the director and it was a free trip to a cool locale like Iceland! (love her in dawn of the dead, fyi!!)"
1,Terrible movie,"I don't know where to start. For one, just very bad acting on everybody's part. Second, its dull and boring. Third, its not worth the money to buy this on blu-ray."
1,Dance Mix not on the single!,"Believe it or not I have both the Carpe diem and Bog singles both on vynl....I am disapointed on the Bog single,but love the Carpe Diem single because of the dance version of the Bog ...which was played even in the pop dance clubs,along with the Goth clubs in Chicago and was a hit!Still yes it is a hard album to find!! Good luck if you can find it, unfortunately mine is not for sale! :-)"
5,Bought for my daughter... taught myself,"I bought this set for my 8 year old. She was able to do most of it on her own but got bored with it!! I ended up playing with it a little and it took off from there. I am most of the way through the book now and can read and play pretty good. Been about 3 months now. I started taking a weekly lesson to make sure I was teaching myself ""right"". Very good series. Very thorough. Glad I invested in it."
4,Whats with the NEW Cover Art?,"I know this may sound strange but it REALLY bugs me when companies drastically change the cover art along the way after they have themed them similarly. Seasons 1-4 had a nice layout that was different yet they coplimented each other well and you could tell they were part of the same collection. Now with season 5 they decide to put the great characters from this show together in a GODDY STAR and slap a ""SEASON 5"" in HUGE text on the bottom where in previous seasons it was less obvious. These changes of course is not enough for me not to buy this.....that would be crazy. BUT I am really not happy with the cover art changes. They should have followed through with the cover art ""theme"" they started with."
5,G. Girls,Wonderful addition to any comedy DVDs. Gave as a gift to family and he says its the best gift ever!
4,Good but not great....,"I own Seasons 1 thru 5 of the Golden Girls. And not one season is a dud, but Season 5 was, to me, just not quite as sharp as the others. Well, I would rate Season one as a 4 star also....They made some adjustments in that one as the season unfolded.However, Season 5 is good....it had it's moments etc. I would advise all Golden Girls fans to certainly buy it.Lin"
5,No Turning Back,"I was skeptical, to say the least, to waste my time on silliness. But this grabbed me from episode one and I could not get enough. I watched the episodes over and over. You can relate to the characters and situations b/c they truly happen, and you most probably know people who are ""keeping up with Jones'."" Hyacinth is trying to Keep Up Appearances but she has her sister to worry about who does not understand Hyacinths need for acceptance in the community. Give it a shot...I'm pretty hard to please and I loved this."
3,"AFun with a lot of froth, no depth","Overall this is a decent biography, not great but readable.The author seems to have a problem as to whether he is writing about Mark Twain or trying to imitate Mark Twain and I find his numerous ""humorous"" side comments irritating.Also it is evident that he tries to put Twain and his work in the context of the time, but he does so in a very superficial way.He is too much of a cheerleader as another reviewer said and his book reminds me too much of a a Hollywood biography than a serious study of his work and life."
2,Painfully Slow and Wordy,"I was disappointed by this biography of one of the most interesting and popular figures in American history and letters. Unlike so many of the other reviewers I found this biography to be excruciatingly long and boring. It takes quite an effort by a writer to make as fascinating a person as Mark Twain dull, but the author succeeds. The writer kept throwing in his personal asides in an effort to be clever, but instead was merely annoying. The writing style is awkward and stilted and it takes a real effort to push through to the end. The author seems to be trying to direct attention to himself as much as the subject. This style makes the 722 pages seem twice as long."
5,no title,"More Catholic than I would prefer, yet still full of much wisdom and words to ponder. Could easily read it again. She so much loves Nature and sees (and seeks) God there, not in a church. This is the book's strength for me."
4,Worth reading,A soul of a poet and angel. love her thoughts and how shes writes. for my daughter but had to read it first.
4,Very satisfied,I bought this for my 6yr old son and he absolutely loved it. He was so excited when he opened it. He is on the taller side for his age and it is a little big. He loves the cape. He likes to wear the costume to bed so I've washed it a lot and it still looks like new.
1,"I'm high-maintenance, so...","I've never been able to decipher what ingredient it is in some soaps that gives me a strange 'surface rash' on my skin ('surface' being that there are raised bumps that scab over but they don't itch and they're not red. Not painful, but not pretty). But, turns out that this soap does this to me. It also has a VERY strong medicinal smell which is a bit too strong for what I'd prefer in a soap and probably part of what causes me to break out. So, QUALIFIER: This soap does not work for me due to my sensitive skin, but may be great for others who do not have this challenge."
2,Olivella Face and Body Bar,"This soap has an unpleasant medicinal smell. I asked for fragrance free soap and was sent this. The representative at Touch of Europe said it was fragrance free, but it definitely is not."
2,Standard fare with an accent.,"I really wanted to like Bend It Like Beckham. The cast was good at playing their very one dimensional roles and cutting standard Hollywood dialouge. However I was expecting that maybe, just maybe there would be one single shred of originality. However there was none. The plot twists were predictable, and I did not even feel good after watching the movie. Try this movie yourself and form your own opinions. But if you are looking for anything original this movie fails to deliver."
3,Bend It Like Beckham,"I think the movie was all hype. Given the rave reviews the movie got as being one of the best in 2003, I was expecting more thrilling and more intriguing plots. Instead, most of the plots were predictable and even at one time I slept for a couple of minutes while watching the video. I was expecting it to be as fascinating, if not better than ""Mississippi Masala."" Bend It Like Beckham-a very disappointing movie, for all the hype and rave reviews it has garnered."
2,predictable,"every step can be predicted. in fact, you already have seen this movie a thousand times. americans are suckers for schlock if it has a foreign accent."
4,Sports movies rule!,"At its core, this tale is rather cliche. On the other hand, there's a saying that goes ""if it's not broke, why fix it?"" I love these stories of underdog characters overcoming adversity and criticism to follow their dreams, particularly when it is sports related. I really enjoyed how this movie revolved around the Indian culture, something not too common in American movies (although this film is British)."
5,Football and life as one,"I though this film was fantastic! It had a great pace to it, much like a football (soccer) match. The characters were ""real"" poeple, and you really got to know them, and actually care what happens to them. I love sports-type movies, and this one, along with Slapshot, are by far my favoties. This will certainly be finding a home of my DVD shelf once it is available. Go see it in the cinema before it's gone ...!"
4,Gurinder Chadha rocks!,"I really enjoyed this film. The music, dancing, costumes, etc. were excellent. In the bonus features, learning to make Aloo Gobi (sp?) was fun.I am pretty tired of the whole gay theme in almost every movie I see these days and this film was no exception. The gay Indian dude/best friend of Parminder Nagra and the best friend's mom obsessed with the fact that her daughter (Keira Knightly) might be gay, really annoyed me. It would have been nice to watch this film without those two distractions.I'm looking forward to Gurinder's next project as the one that followed this one (Bride and Prejudice) was great!"
3,A great novel once you read it...,"Henry James is a genius when it comes to writing about American women in the 1800's. Although it is esteemed one of the greatest novels, I think that it should be condensed greatly. There were some parts that were very descriptive, but dragged on and on. If you have the patience like I do, by all means read this book!The characters are amazing! Isabel Archer is a woman with a strong head on her shoulders. Ralph, her cousin, is trying so hard to get her to notice him. She also attracts the attention of three other bachelors, one who is attracted to her money. I agree with Stephen Koch, that this book is about dreams that do not come true. Exceptional read."
2,Fake masterpiece and a complete waste of time,"Imagine yourself sitting on a theatre seat and staring at the stage where a bunch of names handwritten on a piece of cardboard paper boldly by the same person, are going back and forth to bigger carboard written names like ""England, America, Roma, Florence"" endlessly and a dubbed voice talking over them boring you to death. This is how i feel reading this book. A portrait for 700 pages for god's sake! A casual neighborhood rumor or playing pac man can give you much more literary pleasure than this one. If you are over 30 don't waste your time with this."
4,A complex transformation of a girl to a woman betrayed.,"Isabel Archer arrives in Europe as a confident girl who revels in independence of thought and looks forward to her discovery of the world. Her unexpected inheritance causes her to be the target of clever and seductive fortune seekers. Once trapped in their world, she is torn in many directions. In the end, she is educated by the discovery of how she has been betrayed, but is also freed by that knowledge. This is a complex book about people with complex motives, but is a very satisfying read. END"
2,Not a good boomerang,"The Channel Craft Spirit of Wind boomerang doesn't return without significant tuning (bending) because of how they're manufactured. Tuning instructions are not included with this boomerang. This is not a good boomerang for beginners. Even though the package says that each one is flight tested, this is probably not true, because the ones I've thrown are incapable of returning and I've been throwing boomerangs for 16 years and own around a hundred. Save your money and buy a real returner."
4,Great Book,"Great book, references scientific research as well as aesthetic qualities of many song birds and non-song birds bringing the two realms of reasoning to somewhat of a compromise. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know why birds sing."
5,great music,"i love sheila e's drumming and this is one great song, especially the extended mix. It has a great beat and my friends can't help but dance in my living room when i play it! lol"

5,A Performer's Journey to Forgiveness and Acceptance,Honest and self deprecating are just two descriptions of this performer's life story. No excuses or distortions of his peccadilloes on the road or his love for his family against a backdrop of the struggle for success. A wonderful read for the fan and a lesson for all upcoming performers.
1,You get what you pay for,"Truly poor sound quality, inconvenient controls and low-end materials made this a regrettable choice."
4,i couldn't stop reading.,"i picked this book up by chance, & i'm glad i did. i sat down to read it on my day off & i ended up reading it all within a matter of hours. this book sparked my interest & imagination easily. it kept my attention the whole time; i couldn't put it down. she is easily someone people could identify with.just the interactions between characters & the downturns it took, left me commenting out loud to myself. a few times i got so into it, i had to put it down for a minute, to breathe.it's definately a fun read, if you've got the time to spare."
4,Soo good,"This book Brave New Girl, so soo good. I find that i can relate to it really well, and yeah, it is now like one of my favorite books, i would say that all of you should go out and get it, or at least rent it from the libary. It deals with friend, family, and drug issues. Every teen should have this"
2,Too far away,"OK, this book has a good ending with loads of actions BUT -unfortunately - everything that comes before kind of lacks something.I bought this book mainly because of the comparison to 'Catcher in the rye' (by JD Salinger), but this book is nowhere near it.Doreen, the main character seems mostly nave and passive, with no ideas of her own. That makes her, and the story, a little strange and 'far-away'.Anyway, if you like 'Catcher in the Rye' and are thinking of buying Brave New Girl then you're probable better of just reading 'Catcher in the Rye' again."
2,"Go back to previous years, pass on this one","I agree with the other reviewer. I was disappointed in this year's BAP as well. I'm an avid reader of previous collections and was happy to see Rita Dove edit the previous edition, as she seemed to value diversity in gender, ethnicity, and style much more than Haas, who seemed to select more academic, less human works (and as the previous reviewer mentioned, his wife, which I have mixed feelings about). His wife is a wonderful language poet, but really. Overall, a stuffy volume that didn't seem very representative of modern American poetry today. Save your money and borrow it from the library if you really must read it."
2,What is poetry?,"There has been much debate over the past ten years of what constitutes poetry. This book involves a broad scope of what is now considered poetry and why very few people ""like"" poetry. To sum it up, ""good grief!"""
3,The usual best and worst of poetry,"Nearly every edition in this series contains I like and poems I hate. It really does depend on the editor's tastes. Since Hass is big on ambiguity, language poetry, and fragmented narratives, many of the poems here follow that. My favorites include: Bly, Rich, Lydia Davis, James Galvin. I think overall this is one of the top few books in this series. I can already see that I'm not going to like the 2002 edited by Creeley"
3,a little too much,These are long!!!! They get kinda boring and i think they just put in the info to fill the book.
3,Good but lacking,"Yes, it talks only about Shih Tzus but I was looking for more about their extreme habits. This was all positive and mentions the stubborness in the cutsey way. No emphasis on their negatives which all dogs have, such as the possessive nature toward the dog's master. Tell me the negative. I can handle it."
3,Check out Phil Polsinelli,"If anyone listens seriously to music (that is actively, critcally) the bass player, Phil Polsinelli's (who industry people will know, I'm sure) work on this album is absolutely outstanding. Worth it just for that."
2,Fat-Free? Really? This Fad Diet Is Dying Out,"I suppose if you are looking for a ""fat-free"" recipe book that this one will suffice. But with all that we have learned about how healthy fat is for an optimal human diet, why would anyone deliberately limit their intake of this invaluable part of their nutritional plan for optimal health to less than one gram per meal? Lunacy! Eat the fat, cut the carbs and be healthy for life."
3,Nothing exceptional....,"I happened across this book at my local library three years ago and decided to read it today mainly due to a lack of any other worthwhile fictional reading material. Though I will admit to finishing this novel in one read and being moderately entertained by it, it is certainly not something that will stand out as a trully profound story. The character developement can be captivating, but book falls flat with its ending and there is trully a lack of any original horror or ""creepiness"" elements."
3,My New RC -CD,"I was thrilled to listen to this Album-Its quite something and when I opened up the packaging from the thick cardboard box the case was damaged and the CD cover fell apart.So far though, the music from the CD seems alright. I guess you get what you pay for.RS"
1,"""The Tin-Foil Kid"" -Should be the title","This just goes to show that if you make an effort at something, no matter how LAME the effort -some people will like it.We just had a great blockbuster smash hit movie. Let's follow it up with a cartoon in an atemptto capture the younger viewer (our movie was PG13 after all). Now make it fast quick and in a hurry!I will preface my statements by saying I have only seen the pilot episode form the ""Iron Man -2 disc set"".This is NOT Iron Man. Tony Stark isn't Peter Parker, nor should his story be ripped from some rejected power-ranger script. We start the series with a classic rogue like ""The Mandrian"", and the rest seems imprompto -employing the most basic CG animation, shallow story lines and very few characters.No Thanks, I'll pass. And I recommend you should too."
1,Alternate Iron Man story,"I refuse to watch this because in comics or films the timeline is when Tony Stark is a man not a boy. So this really is a bastardization of the original story. Tony Stark as a teen doesnt interest me. In the true stories he is just a rich kid that can appreciate resposibility and that he learns that as an adult; NOT a teen. I will buy the older series as it is true to the storyline. I was interested in this series when I heard about it, but didnt realize later after reviewing that this is the only Iron Man story that conflicts with all others and claims that he had Iron Man armor as a boy. What a load of manure. Especially since it is the only of its kind. The movies are terrific and mention that the FIRST Iron Man armor is created when he is injured as an adult."
5,On Liberty - Kindle,"This is the first time I read this author and this classic essay. He is one of collection of writers on which we build our present thoughts on political systems so many of the points are given now. However, it is interesting his transparent logic development for his conclusions.I recommend to read the forward portion of the book and do a basic web search on the author so that you have context on the author and the period. Also, note the language is difficult due to the complex language and frequent use of double negatives. But, it is a short work."
1,No table of contents....,"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."
4,Excellent Funny Lesmovie,"The actresses are great, very believeable actuation,funny and intelligent, looks like a American version of Spanish director Almodovar's movies."
4,Honest gem of a film - real people navigating intimacy in relationships,"I really enjoyed this film. It's funny but in a quiet way. I thought the relationship between Jessica and Helen felt real. Except for the portrayals of Jessica's mother and the wacky friend who gives overbearing advice, I felt the film veered away from stereotypes. I liked how the film showed that Jessica's fear of intimacy (with men and women) were the same - her refusal to divulge how Helen has become a part of her life to her mother reminds me of similar situations with straight couples - the man who refuses to introduce his mistress or girlfriend to his mother out of shame. I thought this was a well-written film about relationships."
4,This movie was very well done,"Not your typical lesbian movie, that I suspect are really made for men anyway. Jessica is just tired of man dates because men are sooooo boring. So she decides to place an ad in woman seeking woman section of the paper, but as a safety net she includes a line of poetry in her ad that would kind of sort out the morons from women she might actually have something in common with. So she actually meets an attractive, smart, successful, funny woman. They get along wonderfully, yet, something's missing. There's no passion in the bedroom. So, Jessica's not really a lesbian, but she has found a best friend, and the other girl discovers that she likes women better and meets a another girl better suited to her tastes. But still has a deep friendship with Jessica. The last scene has Jessica and her meeting for lunch. It was very well done. Enjoy!"
4,Refreshing,"A refreshing twist on the romantic comedy, ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" trades on the promise of exploring the taboo subject of straight girls having lesbian relationships. But the fact that it is less about homosexuality and more about finding the right mate - regardless of gender - ensures it has wider appeal. Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen are endearing as the would-be lovers, Jessica and Helen, and they're backed up by a wonderful supporting cast - especially Jackie Hoffman as co-worker Joan, and Tovah Feldshuh as Mrs Stein. But it's Helen's gay friends Martin and Sebastian who ultimately steal the show. The script mostly steers clear of cliché and mawkishness, but there is a yuppies-recovering-their-artistic-selves subtext that sometimes screams a little too loud. However, the resolution of the love story is realistic and, for that reason, the minor faults are easily forgiven."
5,Such a good movie!,Aren't we all searching for who we are and where we fit in? Love this movie . . . will probably see it again and again.
5,Kissing Jessica Stein,"Wonderful, funny, and romantic. I love the characters and actors!!! The dialogue is sharp and witty. The soundtrack is fun, too."
4,Very sweet movie,"I enjoyed this film. Good actors and dialog, Jessica is so beautiful. I wouldn't watch it over and over but if I saw it playing on the tv I'd give it another watch. I dont own a tv so it would have to be a friend's house which, would be even better. Its a nice movie to sit down with a friend and see."
4,Nice and entertaining. but keep and opend mind,"Jessica despairs of finding Mr. Right (mostly because she is looking for Mr. Perfect). Helen is looking for a new twist on the casual string of men she keeps on the side. When neurotic Jessica answers Helen's Woman Seeking Woman personal add, it looks like Jessica won't have the nerve to go through with the date. Helen manages to force herself into Jessica's evening and eventually into her life. But how much more than that is what the rest of this wacky little film is about.Cute and funny if you are willing to overlook the whole thing about being born gay or not being born gay. After all say so many on both sides - ""How do you know if you haven't tried?""The DVD was nice and has lots of extras including deleted scenes and two tracks of audio commentary. At times you can see that there are some hastily shot moments but when the people behind the file come clean you really learn a lot about what it takes to make an independent film."
2,Novell's Guide to NetWare 5 Networks,I was looking for a complete guide to NetWare 5 for a new network operating system user. This is not it. The was written by experts for experts.
3,Love it or hate it?,"The film is very slow moving, realistic and mostly boring exceptfor sexually explicit scenes and an electrocution. The acting by the leadsis actually very good, but the script writing seems weak and the action very slow. For most people it is a drama that they may miss the point of:father-son multi-generational interaction, systematic racialdiscrimination and the interaction of authority figures with others.An interracial sexual affair seems to have been what sold this movie to some people? I found myself early wishing it were over..."
2,He Gone...He Gone....,"Really - who writes this stuff? I respect Halle Berry but she didnt deserve an oscar for her performance, if anything Thornton's performance was superior given the meager characterization he had to work with. The movie never rises beyond its tour bus view of a multi racial and backwards south with characters seemingly drawn from the foreign born directors brief pit stop at a Tuscaloosa Wal-Mart and we are constantly reminded by the heavy handed directing of the emotional devastation that is supposed to be going on. Oh and lets hope we dont see Puffy in another film for a long, long time."
2,unbelievably explicit sex scenes from respected actors,"I rented the DVD because of the actors in the film, didn't know anything about it prior to seeing it at the video store. Whoa!! I could forgive the rear entry sex scene from the son with a hooker, then Billy Bob about does the same(the hooker bends over nude, but he decides not to go ahead.), but when Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry do the same for an unusually long period of time on screen, that is over the top for respected actors. She got an award?? I thought the no-name actors did the gratuitous things like rear entry worthy of porn. You could watch this by yourself for self-gratification, but nothing else. Don't bring a friend or spouse, IT WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE, I PROMISE.Didn't even finish the movie as I wondered who else would come forward that I used to respect and do the unimaginable..."
1,"If it were the worst, you have something bad you could say","I feel like I have to write SOMETHING out of sense of civic duty, almost. I've seen bad movies. Usually they leave you with a lingering sense of disgust/insult, whatever. Then, the foul impression goes away. When I am bothered it's usually because I feel shame at the waste of resources that were put into the making an awful film.But no, this was the WORST ! LOL.All I can really SAY is ""I want my money back"" -- for real. I was glad to see that very sentiment expressed by a number of reviers here at Amazon.As far as the sex scenes, no great accomplishment, but at least they were fairly straightforward without campy, "" 'scuse-us-but-this-is-sex-now-ha-ha"" cinematic affectations. The rest of the movie spoiled even this simple depiction of human intimacy -- which could otherwise have been basically beguiling screen voodoo. You'd at least have a few minutes worth of footage to TALK ABOUT !I just want my money back, lol."
2,WHERE ARE THE MONSTERS?,"THE ONLY MONSTERS IN MONSTERS BALL ARE THE DEPRESSED CHARACTERS. THE STORY SEEMS TO BE GOING IN A # OF DIRECTIONS, AND ENDS UP NO WHERE. HALLE BARRY'S PERFORMANCE IS GREAT, ALTHOUGH BETTER SUITED FOR A SUPPORTING OSCAR. HER PART WAS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR AN OSCAR IN A LEADING ROLE. I CAN NOT RECOMMEND MONSTERS BALL ON BERRY'S GOOD WORK ALONE, AND BELIEVE ME IT'S THE ONLY HIGHLIGHT HERE. IT IS BEYOND ME HOW THIS DEPRESSING FILM ENDED UP ON SO MANY CRITIC'S TOP 10 LISTS."
1,can't i give this zero stars?,"There's an old adage that if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything. But I will overstep this to prevent any other good decent people of watching this poor excuse of a movie. Simply put, horrible storyline, horrible acting, horrible setting. It's no surprise that this wasn't made by a big time movie studio. Save yourself a lot of headache and don't even bother renting this."
1,MONSTEROUSLY HORRIBLE,"OH JEEZ..........WHERE DO I START?.....THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DREADFUL DREARY FILM IS AN INDEPTH LOOK AT DEATH ROW AND THE MINUTIA OF AN EXECUTION......THEN WE HAVE THE FEMALE LEAD WHO IS AN ABUSIVE MOTHER OF AN OVERWEIGHT SON THAT DIES BY GETTING HIT BY A CAR.....THIS CLUELESS VICTIM MEETS A RACIST REDNECK WHOSE FATHER IS ALSO A RACIST REDNECK AND THEY SOMEHOW, WITHOUT THIS GRIM DRAMA EVER DEALING WITH ANY OF THEIR REAL ISSUES, FALL IN LOVE........OH, HAPPY JOY JOY........ONE OF THE MOST DEPRESSING AND PHONY FILMS OF ALL TIME.......BILLY BOB AND ALOT OF OTHER HOLLYWOOD TYPES THINK THAT MAKING A FILM THAT DEALS WITH GRITTY SUBJECT MATTER IS TO TOUCH UPON THE TRUTH.....ONLY GREAT ART COMES CLOSE TO THE TRUTH OF THIS EXISTENCE.....BAD ART LIKE THIS ONLY ADDS TO THE MISERY.........."
5,Won Me Over,"I have to admit, I came into this one expecting the worst, but came away wondering what took me so long to see it. First off, let me say Halle deserved every bit of her Oscar. Great, believable, performance. Not one moment of phoney, manufactured pathos. She dug deep and came up with honest emotion. The lovemaking.... OK... Have to pause here and gather myself...well, I really can't gather.....discuss amongst yourselves!!!OK, I'm back. Excellent acting, but well-earned kudos to Peter Boyle, even if he is reprieving his ""Joe"" character, to some extent. Maybe that was the idea. A bit of a tongue in cheek reference to that film. Some holes in the plot and a big tribute to Dead Man Walking, but this was actually much better done, both in terms of the capital punishment debate and the overall story.BEK"
5,It's a Good Movie,It's a good movie and worth getting the popcorn and butter out for. The movie gives people a lot to think about yet it's also entertaining.
1,Sex Video,"This movie SUCKS and proves Hally berry IS A PURE ""D"" SLUT HO!!!!All this movie was about was hally getting banged buy this white guy who mistickly wanted to help her(Saw she had some goodies and wanted to get it ON with her really)I dont want to rate this becuase its a waste of life and time but i have to so its a 1 and this isnt a love story its a sex video or something to get you in you wife in the ""MOOD"""
3,....the cutting room......,"So, the International release contains an additional minute between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton! Quaint!The plot is positively Grecian in concept, but besides all of that, it's somewhat a predictable tale of love across the color line with a few complications thrown in for good measure. Stereotypes? Sure, we'll always have those, but the performances are of note, especially Halle Berry - so similar to Dorothy Dandridge, another Hollywood casualty. The premise has been around for some time, fortunately for us, Ms. Berry and Mr. Thornton accepted, real actors, real performances.BUT, I'm not sure how well this movie will play with 'ordinary folk' - sure to be just great with the ""in crowd"".[This movie especially resonates in interracial households and neighborhoods]"
1,NASTY!,"This review in my humble oppinion is going to recive thumbs down, I suspect, from the majority of those who read it. I won't say much about what I saw because I simply could NOT get through this MOVIE...Call it what you will--MORAL SRUBBLES? When I saw that X-RATED scene between Berry and Thorton, it turned my stomache! It literally caused me to loss all of my RESPECT for Hallie Berry, and I haven't watched any of her movies ever since. I felt that what was done in this film was just appalling--and to recieve an Academy Award for a PART LIKE THIS!?. Of course I expect others will differ in their oppinion; but that ""love scene"" was STRAIGHT UP PORN!"
1,HORRIBLE stuff!,"Honestly, there aren't enough to words to describe how bad Monster's Ball is, and how undeserving of an Oscar that hack Halle Berry was. Terrible acting, half-hearted plot, a white knight rushing in to save the po' nigra woman - and let's not get started on how a born-and-bred racist can change in about 48 hours, all because he had sex with a black woman. PLEASE! There was a black woman who deserved an Oscar nod for her riveting role in a movie that year, all right - her name was Nona Gaye, and she was magnificent in ""Ali."" But why award a black woman playing a strong, dignified role that required actual acting skills when we can give it to someone engaging in shrieking, crying, and raw sex (and UNNEEDED raw sex) at that? Hey, is it possible to give this movie zero stars?"
2,Why?,"If packaging and price are an indicator, Monster's Ball is not worthy of your time or money. It's the same story, a poor black man executed in the Deep South and we are supposed to feel for him and his family. Anyone could have written this story. Monster's Ball is not The Green Mile. Why did Halle Berry win an Oscar for her performance? She's worthy of an Oscar for Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, not Monster's Ball. There had to have been another reason because her acting wasn't the reason. Maybe it was because of her sex scene with Billy Bob? Or maybe the Academy felt it was her turn. Lion's Gate known for 'B at best' movies, didn't spend a cent to include a program insert. I guess it was to keep the price down, or maybe they agree Monster's Ball wasn't worth the cost. Cost, cheap but not cheap enough. Thank goodness Bill Bob Thornton kept us interested. This film is rated R for sex and judicial violence. Not recommended for young audiences. Pass on it and get the Green Mile."
2,Trash....,Monster's Ball is a terrible movie. Oscar....yeah right..it must have been for that crazy ... scene that was really unecessary. Halle Berry should have won this award for Dorthy Dandridge...this movie was trash ...
3,Had lots of potential,"This movie is by no means bad and has some great parts (the lovemaking scene between Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, wow!) and is very gritty in some parts (the old man/father who is extremely racist) but overall it falls a bit short of the mark. I could understand the story of the single black mom whose husband is in prison and her frustration with him, but I found it hard to care about the fat boy. When he had the accident I was kind of relieved. Does that sound mean of me? Okay, but that's just how I felt. It's still overall a good film, but rent before you decide to buy."
2,This film isn't even worth reviewing...,"All I want to say is, Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger both deserve 5 BRILLIANT stars for their performances. I'm sorry, but Halle Berry brought my rating down to a star. The storyline is worth another star. Hence, two stars is my rating."
1,Boring,"I give this movie one star for Hally Berry's wonderful performance. However, other than that this movie will bore you to death. It contains one of Hollywood's favorite story line, Southern rascists. This movie is a throw-back to another time in the South. We would appreciate it if Hollywood would take notice that the South has changed."
4,Raw...Yes,"I agree with the spotlight review that calls this movie ""Raw, Real, & Unflinching."" That is a perfect description. Sure, it may be a different cinema style than we're used to, but it's a painful & haunting movie. Your heart will weep for the characters!!"
4,Reality !,"This was a good movie but very dark. Don't buy this if you like only ""feel good"" movies. This is more of a reality story."
2,Undeserving,"This movie left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm compelled to write an online review. Jeezz....talk about manipulation! This ""film"" is full of ""plot points"" that are supposed to move the story to its ultimate ""happy-ending"" conclusion. Instead, I felt maniplated and cheated. Halle Berry basically receives all of her acclaim from being physically beautiful. To me, she is always ""acting""--nothing in this perfromance is real. It's all about screaming and crying---the stuff that Academy Voters adore..."
3,TOO SLOW,THE STORY WAS OKAY. IT GETS SLOW THROUGHT OUT THE MOVIE AND MAKES YOU WANT TO FAST FORWARD THE WHOLE THING. MY HUSBAND DIDN'T CARE FOR IT EITHER. JUST ANOTHER MOVIE MAKING WHITE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUYS.
2,Sorry to be a sexist..,"If it weren't for Halle's beautiful naked body, this movie would be a total piece of .... Why did she win a oscar anyway? It had to be the sex (sorry Halle,) but I could name three other films that she was better in: How about ""Losing Isaiah"" wasn't she better in that film? And even ""Boomerang"" was better than this movie. However, I will watch Monsters Ball again, but I will fast forward the movie to my favorite parts...and that is a shame because she is a good actress...the only reason I watch this movie: Halle naked!"
4,Sometimes ambiguity can be beautiful,"Berry plays the wife of a death row inmate (P. Diddy or whatever his name is now) and Billy Bob the warden responsible for carrying out his execution. Both deliver beautifully subtle performances of seemingly simple characters but with complex emotional histories. Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle deliver nice supporting roles as the warden's son and father, respectively. Peter Boyle's southern accent wasn't entirely convincing though (I think he's from Philly). Ledger, from Perth, Australia, was actually more believeable to me as a southerner. The film is unsentimental and morally ambiguous, leaving much open for the viewer's interpretation. Nicely photographed by Roberto Schaefer and mesmerizing but not overpowering score. Contains rather graphic sex scene for an R-rated movie. Apparently, they had to cut some parts out to get the rating. If you think Halle Berry is hot, you won't be disappointed. Ambiguous ending is strangely satisfying."
5,JOHN DANN AT HIS BEST,"""THE HOUSE GUESTS"" LEAVES NO QUESTION WHY JOHN D. MacDONALD RECIEVED SEVERAL HONORARY PhDs IN LITERATURE. IT IS AN EXCELLENT READ, WHETHER ONE LIKES CATS OR NOT."
5,Mrs. McCall's Student - Carrie,"I'm a student at Doby's Mill Elementary School. I have read the story Agnes Pflumm and the Stone Creek Science Fair and I thought that it was a excellent book for students to read and learn about the scientific method. It tells about how to make an educated guess (hypothesis), how to record your results and to make a chart, and how your graph will usually make a pattern. This book is a great one to read for children of all ages and if you have a science project to do. This is a great book and is one of my favorites."
5,My Review,"I really enjoyed this book because it is about one of my favorite subjects: science! It was great to see that Mrs. Southgate loves science like I do. The scientific method was outlined with a rap! The students in the story showed a spirit of friendship and cooperation. I have always liked science fairs, but this book made me even more excited about it!Mark, 5th graderSC"
2,The worst film of the Austin Powers series.,"As a big fan of austin powers I was looking forward to seeing goldmember. But when I saw it I was really dissapionted. First of all it was no where near as funny as the first two films were.The characters are getting worn out and the new character goldmember is a horribe and dissgusting adition to the group.Plus whoever thought of putting beyonce Knowles in the picture must have not been feeling well that day. She is a terrible actress, is not funny and is nowhere near as good looking as Elizebeth Hurley or Heather Graham. All in all it was a dissapiontment and the worst of the series."
5,Austin Powers Grows UP,"As a group, 23, 29, 55 & 57 we unamiously loved this film. Same level of outrage and disgust, but new twists and much more ""tongue in cheek"". Mega star level appeal. Super James Bond style opening. Dr. Evil and Mini-Me do not let us down. Austin's main chick is, well she's beautiful. Opens weird but build's rapidly and Fat Bastard is everything anyone ever hoped for. We're going back tonight, a film to own."
1,"Oh, and one more thing...","(My previous review was titled ""THIS DVD IS GARBAGE"")You cannot use the ""scan"" function, either. So if you want to skim through a scene you have already seen, or rewind it a smidge, etc, you CAN'T. You can only skip forward or backword in chapter-sized blocks.I am so...irritated! Grrrrr!"
2,This is NOT a funny movie.,"What is so funny about this movie?Nothing really,except one part in the whole movie.ONE part.And they call this a comedy?Bleh.The movie doesen't even have a decent plot and is kinda boring,and some scenes just seem thrown in there for no reason(like the one with Britney Spears...What was that all about?!).So this is a horrible comedy and it has one of the worst storylines in any movie ever made.I mean the storyline is just so bad its hard to believe how some people actually like this movie.And it didn't even end correctly.The DVD features aren't that great either.Don't think about buying this DVD - rent it if you have to.I don't even reccomend renting it.Just skip this movie."
2,Haven't I seen this movie before?,"It's truly official. Austin has completely lost his mojo. The jokes are so repetitive that even the actors look bored telling them. We get the same old catch-phrases thrown at us again and again. If this doesn't bother you - and you just love Austin to death, then by all means see this movie.For me, it's gotten really old. The characters seem lost for anything original to do. The cameos in the movie are entertaining, and I do wonder if this movie would have suffered without them. AP3 is not a horrible movie by any means. I found myself laughing at times, but the true laughs are few and far between.I still need someone to tell me what is so funny about Mini-Me. A really small guy getting getting objectified and physically abused for 90 minutes. Yeah, what a knee-slapper."
4,Goldmember is NOT The Spy That Shagged Me...,"Goldmember was mildly amusing, but the plot was really lame and Goldmember was just annoying... And I'm sorry... Beyonce Knowles CANNOT act... There are a lot of gals that would have made a better Foxy. Also, the cameos got really annoying... The only amusing one was the one with Britney Spears. Die blonde! But the others were really tiring... Dr. Evil and Scott were amusing though... But as previous reviewers have mentioned, it seemed like they just recycled the jokes from the last couple of movies. It was alright, but they could've done better. Pick up the 2nd one instead..."
5,Great movie,"Had this movie forever on dvd, we figured it was time to upgrade to blu ray viewing and glad we did, you cant beat the quality of blu ray for picture and sound. Best Austin powers movie made. If you haven't seen it, definitely need to watch it."
3,"Yes, It Was Funny!","In spite of the insipid repeated singing acts. Every possible sexual innuendo was exploited, as well as a number of others involving passing gas. Lots of high technology, and a major threat threatens the world's future. And at the end good wins out over evil, without the violence of the obviously parodied James Bond movie genre."
1,What is the point?,"The only reason i saw this was because i was visiting a friend who is a projectionest so i watched it from the booth. I was glad i wasn't in the audience. This IS the dumbing down of America at it's best. It's humor is just plan stupid, the acting is a mockery to the actors guild. There is no entertainment value except to show the rest of the world what americans think is comedy. No wonder we are hated. The movie is pointless, doesn't go anywhere, it's stupid and is not very creative. There is no value to this film at all. This film is an insult to real comedy. It's just white trash at it's very best."
3,Goldmember,"This latest installment in the Austin powers series is fairly decent at its best. The movie uses a lot of the same jokes from the last Austin Powers movie, and it doesn't even try to be original. The last two films always tried to raise to bar of comedy to new heights, but this one just gets by off the same jokes as before. It's still good for some laughs that'll entertain you, but I wouldn't expect too much out of it. I thought Mike Myers was still very hillarious in this film as the nefarious Dr. Evil, the heroic Austin Powers, the overweight Fat (...), and the new obscene Goldmember. Overall, it's still a good film to watch, but it's too bad it couldn't live up to its potential."
1,If I could give it zero stars I would!,"The first two movies were great, but Goldmember is not funny. I think I might have laughed 2 maybe 3 times. The rest of the time it was like watching idiots try and figure out why they were even doing a movie, and none of them realized that it was supposed to be a comedy.1.) Mike Myers needs to go back to his original ideas, be the Austin Powers that he created.2.) Have the bad teeth.3.) Dr. Evil does not need to act modern or hip.4.) The sidekick role with mini-me and Austin Powers, not!5.) Lastly, the female has to have chemistry with Austin Powers.Don't waste your money. Watch the first two over again and have a really good laugh."
3,In The Middle,"I mean, I love Mike Myers and all, but this movie wasn't what I expected. There were great settings, but I didn't really like the plot. The jokes were o.k. and I guess the ending and the beginning was interesting. But I guess there was something that just wasn't right."
3,Can You Say (Recycle?),Recycle ..... Hmmmm Thats the word I would use to disscribe 90% of the gags and jokes in Goldmember. Speaking as a person who loved the first two Austin Powers I have to say this movie fell REALLY short of the mark. While the movie does have it`s moments it just was not as creative as the first two movies. When you make a movie with too many recycled jokes it does two things #1 It shows that the director is out of ideas and #2 it becomes a parody of the first two movies and it`s self. On another subject . What is the deal with this DVD ? No captions and you can`t fast foward or rewind you can only skip to begining or end of each chapter (that stinks) Well thats about it Glad to see Fred Savage got some work .
4,Quite funny!,"I saw this movie a few days ago and I enjoyed it. There's a lot more jokes and surprises in this one. I don't think this one is a lot better than the first two because a lot of the jokes are very similar to the first two movies. I give Mike Myers credit for making a good sequel and for playing all the characters very well. Give this movie a chance, you might like it. YEAH BABY YEAH!"
3,Still Going Strong,"I have always liked the Austin Powers movies, but this one, while still very funny, just did not leave me clutching my stomach from laughter pains. Don't get me wrong, this film is very funny at times and Mike Myers did an excellent job, but the addition of Beyonce Knowles and the gratuitous cameos made me think, ""Why are they doing that?""I still think that people should check out this film and judge it for themselves. It has it's moments where you're doubled over with laughter, but unfortunately those moments aren't as often as they have been in the past."
2,ugh,First two austin powers movies will go down in history and some of the funniest spoofs ever. But this one seems to have fallen inwith the other modern spoofs...theyre terrible. Avoid this and all the movies related to meet the spartans.
2,Crass Commercialism,"While I thought most of Goldmember was funny (basically the same joke repeated two dozen times), I was dismayed at the blatant product placement in Goldmember. I guess they needed to find the money for Tom Cruise somewhere. Unfortunately, the conspicuous logo placements are distractions. It's pretty sad that the filmmakers didn't have the confidence in their movie to do away with this crass commercialism.[DW]"
5,"Pure gold, baby! Yeah!","I really don't know why people are dissing this. It was another AP classic.This time, AP has captured Dr. Evil and Mini-me. Evil is sent to a maximum security prison and Mini-me to a normal prison. But after his father Nigel Powers is kidnapped, AP questions Evil and learns that a man from the 70's named Goldmember has him. Meanwhile, Evil and Mini-me esacpe from prision!!!This film has a lot of great moments. Foxy Cleopatra, Evil and Mini-me rapping, The Osbournes, Fat Bastard sumo wresteling, the subtitles joke, the surprise ending, and Fook Mie and Fook Yuo, to name a few. But whatever happened to Felecity?This film is a must-see. But IGNORE THE REVIEWS UNDER 4 STARS! And AP 4 is coming in 2007. Scott will probably be the main villian."
2,Way Too Much Bathroom Humor,"There are just way too many scenes in this film, where there is an attempt to grab a cheap laugh with some bodily function.What has that got to do with a spy spoof? If the film is supposed to satirize James Bond then do it.When a film has to resort to numerous scenes involving defecation, urination, and passing gas that really shows a lack of creative writing.These might be good for a laugh or two early in the film, but it gets old real quick."
1,someone should be ashamed,"The first one was a riot, the 2nd not bad, but three stikes and Mike Myers is out. There is no humor in this movie - only crude attempts at gross slap stick that merit not even a snicker. The only crowd I have heard praise this piece of trash are 17 to 19 year old males - and only when they are together withother 17-19 year old males. And be aware, parents....this movie IS NOT for children under the age of 15. The rating clearly should have been ""R"" - another case of the PG13 spectrum being way too wide. Overall, save your money and go see Big Fat Greek Wedding if you want to laugh."
1,Don't waste your money,The first two Austin Powers movies were great; the third BOMBS. Mike Myers should stop now...
2,pretty awful,"what happened? the truly original and creative humorous edge of the first two films is gone. there's absolutly nothing new in this film, and the chemistry between actors and characters is almost non-existant here. throwing in Beyonce Knowles (however beautiful and talented a singer she is) was a poor choice (austin's old ""flame"" from 1975? right. sure). and michael cain as austin's father is a ridiculous throw away role. plus, all the good jokes from the last two films are recycled and butchered in this movie. i remember laughing nearly every minute at the theatre during the last film; this time i was hard pressed to chuckle a few times during the entirety of Goldmember (the Goldmember character himself was ridiculously stupid). the only truly funny parts were the a-list hollywood celebrity cameos.come on mike myers. what happened?"
2,Okay once,"The thing about this movie is, when I saw it in the theatrSe it was hillarious and unpredictable. When I got this dvd so my family and me could watch it, we sat throught it in total silence. The movie's fine once, so borrow it or something, it's not worth buying. The special features are okay, but not worth buying it alone for."
1,Another raunchy movie not worth anyone's time,"When I went and saw Goldmember in the theater, I thanked the powers that be that I was employed at a theater and got to see the movie for free since it saved me the money I would have lost in buying a ticket. The only reason I gave it one star was because I couldn't go any lower than that, such as no stars or even a negative star. Beside the fact that I don't necessarily like the Austin Powers movies to begin with (hey, you wouldn't like it if your dad's boyfriend forced you to see it, either!) I thought that Goldmember bit the big one. Hard. It's hardly worth the film it's printed on. Save your money and your time and don't buy this movie. But, far be it from me to be ultimately condemning: if you're a diehard fan of Austin Powers, go for it."
1,Running on Empty,"What a shame,People embraced this franchise so much that we just had to love it to death. The funniest moments in this movie are the cameo appearances of Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Spielberg and others...after that runs its course, not much is left.Someone else here says the outtakes are funnier than the movie itself, since they feature Mike Myers improvising. I'm fulloy prepared to believe that. Iron-poor blood otherwise dominates this effort."
4,Smashing Baby...Ya!,"Austin Powers is back in the newest movie yet, Goldmember. Each of these movies reinfents itself with its ranchy humor and big name celebrity cameos!""Wink wink"". Gotta tell you I laughed harder in this movie than Spy who Shagged Me. All the charactors are great, the plotline is standard, but the laughs never stop. Is the Austin Powers saga getting old...naww!"
5,TOO FUNNY,"Honestly I haven't laughed this much since ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"" came out. Sure it may have a couple of jokes seen in the last one that are redone here, but that doesn't matter as long as you have a sense of humor. The cameos are hilarious and Goldmember is a decent villian.My only complaints? Beyonce and the ending. The ending makes me wonder if there can be another sequel and Beyonce isnt given much of a character to play. Foxxy is outshadowed by about everyone else and this really makes me wonder what happened to Felcity Shagwell.Either way, this movie is still very funny and I can highly recommend it."
2,Absolute Failure,"Granted, there were some funny parts to this movie, it pales in comparison to the second. ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" was absolutely current and up to date with pop culture, which is the main basis of the Austin Power's franchise. However, the third is trite and old and GoldMember is just plain disgusting. Knowels was suprisingly good and the DVD was great with loads of extras."
1,Austin Powers has died and gone to Hollywood.,"This was the most self-aggrandizing of Mike Myers' ""Austin"" movies to date. The first one was fun, the second one was entertaining enough, but definitely needed some re-work, but this movie -- with its little ""Hollywood Insider"" bits and Myers'egotistical performance made me wonder how he gets his head through most doors. I watched it once and was sorry to have wasted my time. Rent this one before you buy. You may not think it'll deserve a second viewing."
4,From loud chaos to subtle structure,"Having listened to alot of electronic, IDM, etc for years now it's interesting to hear what the new ""it"" guys are doing. Kid 606 has been talked about all over lately, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly why.An album like ""down with the scene"" is more like a good p*ss on the whole electronic scene, and thankfully so. Alot of abrasive tongue in cheek sorta songs. Almost a little too sly and going over the top towards the unlistenable in mockery.Soccergirl is just the opposite. Working well within the genre, and being quite soothing. To call it ambient is playing it down, since it scrapes at the glass walls that define ""ambient music"" with long metallic nails. While not typical of his junkyard genre-bending styles, this EP is refreshingly different and can even be played out-loud without forcing the general public to their knees with distortion.Pick up the Jake Mandell ""Football"" CD also, in the same line."
3,you get what you pay for!!,"As a writer, I recently decided to purchase a voice recorder, and decided on the Memorex beacause of it's low price. The recorder is rather large, it's much to big to fit in your hand. The messages you recorded are very hard to hear, and the controls seem simple but are actually very complex. This recorder is not worth it, spend the money on a nicer model(it makes a big difference), or stick to the old pad and pencil."
4,"Good product, fast delivery, but box has been opened before","I did some functionality/price comparisons before putting the order, and I am happy with my choice. The delivery was much faster than the estimate. The only disappointment is that when I opened the box, I noticed that the packagings don't look like brand new, factory packaging: the Styrofoam shock absorbers had missing pieces, the wrapping of the unit was open, and the remote control was taped to the wrapping haphazardly. So, I'm not sure if I'll still buy from Amazon in the future."
4,pioneer receiver 7.1,4 out 5 stars- a good reciever for the price and $200 dollars cheaper than best buy. To save much time and aggravation however- please remember that you won't get sound with just the HDMI wire connection- you must add an audio (optical/ etc..) wire hook up as well.Pioneer VSX-917V-K Home Theater Receiver (Black)
3,"great product, big defect","I got this receiever for christmas and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Great sound, amazing features and clarity you wouldnt believe. The auto setup mic works well..you may have to adjust the equalizer to your liking afterwards though. The problem was when playing the system at high volume (not hurting the speakers) it would say OVERLOAD and shut down. I checked all the wires..none touching, tried different speakers, different wire, couldnt solve the problem. So I looked online seems some others have this same problem..but since i like the quality and features of it, i am returning it and purchasing the Pioneer VSX-1017 a little more power, THX certified and a few more connections."
3,Valuable for patients,"If you are a bone cancer patient, or if someone in your family has bone cancer, this is a helpful collection of government documents on these diseases and their treatment, getting through treatment, and sources of further information. However, if you are a healthcare professional, despite the publisher's claim that this will be useful, you can save yourself money and time by going straight to PubMed, as there is virtually nothing here for you except a list of papers on the subject."
1,Cheap edition,"The edition I bought in September, 2011, is so cheaply printed I am embarrassed to have it in my library. The famous Henri Cartier-Bresson photo on the cover is so poorly reproduced the top of Jung's head is as white as the peaks of the Swiss Alps. It is OK if you want to read it once and throw it away, but if you want a copy for reference I'd look for a good used edition."
5,"Beautiful, sexy, forces you to flip for more","This would be my favorite Manhwa so far and i have read plenty of them. From romances like Bride Of The Water God and Goong, to comedy like Zippy Ziggy and Ping. And also the ones that are popular in my area. It takes place in the very distant future. Although the translation is a big confusing at times this manhwa is very enjoyable and well worth the price. If you want more of my advice i would find someway to buy this book now becuse it is becoming very scarce very quickly."
4,The band swings hard,"I know a few reviewers think the band on this isn't very good, but for me it swings. I have to agree with the person who said Soul Serenade is better than the studio version. It's FAR better. As James Brown would say, ""The groove is here.""I think the album is full of great performances, the drummer kicks it and I like the song selection a lot more than Fillmore. Less Bread covers, more Aretha. Also the piano is front and center. I assume it's Aretha herself and it's stellar.Maybe I'm just less sensitive to things being out of tune. I don't know. But I love this album."
2,Why write a book for someone else?,"Not bad for a novice, however if this is the method of Noel Tyl, why didn't Noel Tyl write the book? Does Basil Fearrington not have his own method to the teachings of astrology, or was he simply paid by Noel Tyl to sing his praises?"
5,Best Introductory book to astrological analysis,"Basil Fearrington's The New Way... is an incredibly helpful book for those eager to enter into no nonsense, real life astrological analysis. From my almost 40 years experience into astrological literature and study, I can recommend this book with 5 stars! You will not be disappointed."
4,Interesting Setting and Time,"This looks like a promising new series to watch for. For those who like period mysteries, this author is definitely a good one to keep in mind. The setting in late 18 century Philedelphia is different, but a good one just the same. I like the hero - McLeary is a believable and entertaining narrator. I look forward to seeing more from Mr. Graham"
3,Good for the price,"Took some photos with this tele-converter and the results were OK. I wasn't real happy with the crispness but that could have been me using a monopod instead of a tripod. I was using a vibration reduction lens and I'm not sure whether that helped or not with the monopod. The reduction in light is noticable, especially with digital lenses which already don't let in as much light. Be prepared to manually focus as the focus at full zoom will hunt on a cloudy day. I eventually purchased another brand 1.4x converter and a longer lens to improve my low light capabilities. Quality of this teleconverter was very good but it didn't achieve the results I had hoped for."
4,New York then and now,A district attorney investigates the day-light brutal murdering of a Puerto-Rican blind boy by a gang of Italian-American teens.A 1961st-year movie is interesting for depicting how far society had since on any merit gone.A DVD itself is a poor-produced product.
5,TRUE STORY,"This is based on a true story of a murder in NYC that was the result of two ethnic gangs fighting. John Frankenheimer proved early on that he would become a legendary Director in Hollywood. So in awe of Frankenheimer was Burt Lancaster, he asked him to take over The Birdman of Alcatraz direction. Great cast. Don't pass this one up!"
1,My favorite Ry album and the worst remastering job of the series,"Well, the packaging IS cool, with reproductions not only of the LP sleeve and disc label, but also the inner paper sleeve. However, the sound is a disaster. The entire disc has been given an extreme treble boost, which creates distortion and completely changes its character. On many songs the percussion (especially cymbals and snare) dominates the mix, making a song such as ""Tamp 'Em Up Solid"" sound almost like cocktail jazz. The old CD sounds muffled in comparison, but it - like the rest of Reprise's domestic CD reissues - was true to the original LP sound. Warner Brothers engineers (and Ry) had wonderful ears, and I'm sure the mix we heard in 1974 was close to the one they wanted. This is like listening to a band from inside the snare drum. I don't know how someone listening to this album for the first time would react to the new mix, but I can't handle it. Painful and disappointing."
1,Not a fan of guided reading,"My work is primarily with children who struggle in learning to read (and adults). The preponderance of evidence shows that guided reading is not the intervention/reading instruction that is most beneficial in helping them to catch up to their peers. I do use some leveled readers, but mostly prefer texts that allow these students to analyze individual word sounds/phonemes, instead of memorize words as wholes, rely on context cues/picture cues/repetitive patterns."
2,Definitely not safe for cooks with A.D.D.!,"I've never had a deep fryer before, and the one my mother had had a lid on it while it was cooking. The storage lid for this one is made of very soft plastic...part of it melted yesterday just from close proximity to a stove burner. But it was still usable...until today, when I plugged the fryer in to re-heat it and the whole lid melted into the oil. (Yes, I did read the manual and knew better, but sometimes I'm just not that good at remembering things.) I'm not sure now whether it will be usable after I clean it out, might be. But honestly, this isn't safe if you are even slightly absent-minded. [...] I admit, the price is good. Unless it only lasts a week."
5,WOW!!!! It's just Perfect!.....,Just what I was looking for. I wish there were something that can tell you when the oil is ready to fry. Other than that.... Perfect!!!!!!
5,FRY DADDY'S...GRAN PAPPY FRYER!...AWESOME!,"A bigger version of the ""Fry Daddy"" which we have. The ""GRAN PAPPY"" has same qualities of the smaller version just bigger to cook more food at one time! Definitely worth the purchase and excellent transaction with Amazon.com!"
5,Works well!,This is a nice fryer. I like the size and it is the perfect temperature for frying most things. I also like that I can cool the oil and store it in the fryer because it has a snap on cover. Very nice.
4,Good Drama...,This biography is a true story about a young American who gets caught in Turkey (right before he boards the plane to go home) smuggling drugs. The movie moves a bit slow after authorities incarcerate him. Makes me think twice about traveling to third-world countries. Good drama and descent story. BEST screen play I have ever seen. Though there should be a remake of the movie to spiff it up a little more.
1,Racist movie,"I watched the movie as a citizen of Turkish Republic. It is a true story? If it is, it is prefectly Ok to show the unfairness of a prison life however they can NOT generalize to its society what happened in the prison. My only recommendation those who are judging turkish people just because of this movie is to watch 'Sleepers'. Unfairness can happen in prison life but there is no need to have very racist dialogues in the movie."
1,Awful movie,"This is one of the worst movies that has ever been made. Ridiculous plot, irrelevant to the book, bad directing and a complete waste of time."
1,A terrible propaganda,"This is a terrible propaganda of the Armenian lobby in the USA against Turkey. The whole purpose of the movie is to create a bad reputation of Turkey and Turks. Apart from this, the movie is nothing. Not a single bit of thing, even a Turkish name for a chief character, has anything to do with reality. Yet, they shamelessly call it a ""true story"". Apart from the propaganda part, the story is a simple one, without any originality. So the Oscar goes to the Armenian lobby... For those who wonder: 1- The movie is shown several times on Turkish TV channels. 2- Alan Parker and Oliver Stone are not hated in Turkey. 3- After 20 years, American tourists still do not prefer Turkish coasts."
1,THIS MOVIE DOESN'T SHOW ANY REALITIES!,"I know that many of you impressed with this movie. However,let me tell you that you impressed for a movie which is made by people who hate Turkey. Why does the story takes place in Turkey? Do you think it would be different if you were caught in somewhere else with drugs? I don't think so. I suggest all of you to visit Turkey, and see what the heaven(not the hell) looks like. Instead of wasting your money to buy these kind of movies, save it for a nice trip to Turkey!"
3,Gripping and not-always-so-great,"This star-making vehicle for Brad Davis, he of the more-carnal-than James Dean school, has elements of real tension and hopeless Turkish jail atmosphere.There are flaws, however, including a script that isn't entirely faithful to Hayes' story and a no-doubt-studio-inspired ""no, I cant kiss a dude, even in prison"" moment that Mr. Hayes (to say nothing of Mr. Davis) never quite experienced in real-life.And the booby-thru-glass-partition scene is just plain silly. (Did this happen?!?)Also, the film gets a little draggy with its one-atrocity-after-another approach to telling its tale... not always to the greatest effect.Still a decent movie."
5,A must have for anyone that is in the architecture field!,"Cannot say enough about this dictionary. If you have seen any Ching books (architecture students) this one should be on the top of your list. Great reference, great illustrations a must have for your library."
5,Great For Those New to Architecture,"I was looking for a reference book that I could use to develop a knowledge of architecture. As someone completely new to architecture... I had no idea what to buy. After sifting through a bunch of books on the subject, this book stood out to me. I bought it -- and I'm very glad I did. I don't know what this book is like for an advanced architecture student, but I can safely say that it will contain most if not all of what you're looking for in an EASY TO REFERENCE to design.Highly recommended to those looking to either learn more about architecture or as a general architecture reference."
5,WONDEFUL!,Hello....I have yet to read the book...but i am lucky...becasue J.Todd Wilsons father (Mr. Jon Wilson) is my american history teacher at my highschool and he had a copy today and i read the first few pages and i told him that i had to get a copy of my own! its wonderful...ima also getting it signed by the author....hopefully :)
2,"Not bad, not great!","The Cream series have yet to REALLY impress me. (This album is the second addition to my collection, and probably my last). Without a doubt, the most energetic song between the two CD's is Disc 2's Blow Ya' Mind by Lock N' Load. Everyone goes CRAZY in the clubs for this song. I recommend just buying the single of Blow Ya' Mind, as I did. The mix included in this Cream compilation is NOT the best one out there. L8ter Sk8ter's"
3,A good movie for a movie night,"This is a pretty good movie. The idea was a good one, and I think it was based on another movie or a book, or something? I don't really remember.But I think it was a good movie. It wasn't a great one because of the ending (not an incredible ending) and it was a bit unbelievable at times, but I've always loved Jodie Foster's acting.I gave it three stars just because of how unbelievable it was in certain parts, but it wasn't a bad movie. You should give it a watch, rent it, but not buy. You could possibly be disappointed."
5,Great suspense,This movie was sooo suspensful! I kept waiting to see what would happen next and jumping out of my chair! It's a pretty good movie and Jared Leto is hot.
1,How Convenient...,"...that she bought a house with such a unique feature, and not a moment too soon. Really dumb movie."
1,Bad Movie!,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story line was stupid. I couldnt get thru the movie without falling asleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
1,"Wow, was this a Bad Movie...","I'm sorry to say ... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And it was a free rental! What a disappointment... the movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be Home Alone or Psycho and sadly, it never even began to touch the hem of either of those movies. Blech."
3,Eh,"Well. Um. What we have here is David Fincher's weakest film. Partly due to the fact that David Koepp's screenplay takes a simple premise and writes it simply -- with what seems like as little effort as possible.It moves.Jody Foster and Forest Wittaker do their job well here, as do the other actors to a lesser extent, but the movie's nothing special. It's something to stick in the dvd player on a Friday night if you've already seen all the really good movies released lately.But it does, of course, have Fincher's normal visual flair, which is sort of entertaining in and of itself. The camera work is great.So if you want to want a fast-moving movie that doesn't make you think, you could do worse. However, if you want to see something that makes you think, if you want something on the level of FIGHT CLUB or SEVEN, well, go someplace else."
2,Panic Room puts you to sleep before ever scaring you,"I recently rented this movie on DVD, and I'm sure glad that's all I did. The plot is about as shallow as you can get, burglars break in, mom and daughter lock themselves in panic room. The rest of the movie is filled with the burglars cussing one another because they can't break in. There's also many other plot holes, for instance, when Foster is finally able to call 911, they put her on hold! unbelievable! After the movie ended I hoped for some interesting features on the making of, but nothing. All you get is a trailer and some worthless filmographies. The movie wasn't scary in the least, so if you want some good sci-fi thrillers of recent, rent The Others or wait for The Ring to come out on DVD."
2,A Miss,"Great concept for a film. But, executed poorly. Fincher is great director who couldn't seem to get this one off the ground. Plus, did anyone who worked on this film, look at the dailies? Jared Leto was embarrasing with his overacting. A true B-movie performance. I wasn't surprised when his character was killed off. Weak. I look forward to Fincher's next film."
3,Underwhelming,"This is a good, but under whelming movie.The plot is somewhat predictable.Good acting, but nothing out of the ordinary."
4,Good Thriller.......,"Jodie Foster yet again does not fail to give us an outstanding performance in this gripping thriller. The film centers around Meg ( Foster ) and her young daughter Sarah. They live in New York following Meg's divorce. In their home is a hidden room built to provide safety for in case of a break in. Well, the unimaginable happens when 3 intruders break into the home in search of something very valueable to them that was left behind by the previous homeowners. Meg and her daughter must now fight for their lives while hidding in their Panic Room. This is a edge of your seat thriller as you see what a mother will do to save not only herself but her sick daughter. Great story and good performances with some violence. I'd suggest anyone who has not seen this movie, rent it for if you like good thrillers, this movie won't disappoint. Jodie Foster gives this movie a extra star with her great performance."
5,No Panic about panic room,"Panic room is a great movie. I've seen it twice and would have seen it again, but time would not allow. Jodie Foster is great in this performance as usual. Forest Whitaker was just ok. Maybe he was still thinking about the Fat Albert flop. Not sure what was on his mind, but the movie was original and filled with excitment and unexpected activity. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants originality and excitement all at the same time."
4,solid thriller with great performances all around,"I agree it doesn't hold up with Seven and Fight Club but it's way better then The Game and Aliens 3, not that I dont like them movies but this one is good old time. Foster gives another fine tuned performance, Kristen Stewart as her daughter is also excellent. The 3 robbers, Forest Whitaker, Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam are all sinister and evil in their own little ways though Yoakam is more violent and crazy. Leto holds up his end until he is shot in the eye by Yoakam and Whitaker does great work as well. Predictible yet fun it starts right off and then ends in a violent finale. I guess people have bad tastes. Dialouge isnt that bad, people."
5,Feels like a modern Hitchcock,"For the most part the entire movie is contained within a single house, via the multiple floors. Because of that, and its overall tone, it reminds me of Hitchcock's Rope.While this doesn't make use of long takes with very few cuts like Rope did, it does use what seems to becoming Fincher's evolving trademark of interesting camera paths that aren't feasible in reality (through the handle of a coffee pot, between stair railing bannisters, etc).I am a big fan of David Fincher's films, and this one - while not as great as Seven or Fight Club - still has a great overall tone to it.It has the overall cold feeling that he attains via flourescent lights as he does in his other films - which seems to be increasingly popular these days."
3,m - Sinecore,"m, better known as Panacea, delivers SINECORE, an album that shows off his more ambient side. That is, if you can be ambient and still sharp and harsh. The digital growls on ""Track 1"" hint at his other side, but the higher tones seem to be the order of the day. ""Track 3"" has a growing sci-fi menace to it, like a spaceship under siege by ghosts. The growls return on ""Track 10,"" but many of the tracks are indistinguishable from one another--they use the same frequencies and have the same approximate tempo (though there are a few standouts, like the strange, sparkling stardust on ""Track 11""). While it's a convincingly creepy trip into outer space, it's not yet one that will haunt your dreams."
4,Watch out! Book and tapes are sold separately.,"I bought the audio cassette edition for obvious reasons (I'm trying to learn on my own without the benefit of a native speaker to guide me and drill pronunciation with me.) The quality of the spoken recordings is very high, though I was somewhat irked to find the book absent (the cassettes are pretty much useless on their own); so I had to buy the book separately. That makes a total of over 50 dollars - but still,I guess that's a pittance for lifelong access to the magical kingdom of Irish language and literature!"
1,Audio Cassettes???,"I've used the textbook in class, and it was great with the help of a teacher. But as a teach-yourself with audio cassettes...I mean, audio cassettes!! It is a hopelessly outdated - not to mention annoying to use - technology. Wait for a version with CD's, otherwise this is a very difficult text for self-instruction."
4,good stuff,I loved this book and will be passing it on to my friends... very encouraging and stimulating for my stage in life. Loved it.
3,Intense,The beginning of this story was scary. Cathy Weaver helps an injured man on a deserted road during a rainstorm and it changes her life forever. All of a sudden her life is in danger. Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was suspense but the story did drag abit. It was not the best work of Tess Gerritsen but it was an somewhat sedate thriller with a nice romance.
3,"First two-thirds a nail-biter, but lost focus towards end.","I really enjoyed this book for the first two-thirds. I couldn't put it down. But the last third seemed to focus on the new lovers relationship, with constant game-playing and testing their love. The leaving and coming back and then threatening to leave, and ""do you really want me to stay"" left me thinking these people are pretty stupid. Sorry Tess, I've loved everything else you've written."
2,what Co2 cartridge ?,"I ordered this charger as the ad posted it was new and it came with a C02 cartridge when I received the package in the mail today the item was just inside a mail envelope no product packaging and no cartridge, I'm disappointed."
1,Did not ever receive this order,"Usually I get everything I order from Amazon in timely manner and in good quality. This item was debited from my account, but I never received it. Now I am in the midst of a ""WHERE'S MY STUFF"" situation. So sad."
4,The TRUTH MAN,Works ok. I like it. It is a little hard to use but anyone can do it but much easier with 2 people... One to hold the coil/tube and one to pump
5,"Moving, Colorful, and Unique.","I Am Sam is a movie I now treasure and treat very dearly. Not only are the actors absolutely AMAZING, the script captured their desired personalities to create a real and beautiful cast of characters. Not only was the cast well chosen, the technical aspects of this movie serve for a very different feel than what was common when this movie was released. The unsteadiness of the camera and the odd angles create a sense of unbalance and uncertainty when needed, and the colors are bright, vivid, and contribute greately to the scene they're in.I quickly became deeply emersed in this film. This movie made me smile like I haven't in a long time, and I just felt like crying out of happiness.Overall, it's a wonderful movie. I suggest you see this movie, it has the amazing ability to warm a heart like no other film. It's one of a kind, a gem of Hollywood. It is imagination at its best."
3,Somewhat pleased..mostly because of Dakota..,"I love Dakota Fanning, she's the cutest girl I've seen in movies..I was somewhat disappointed with her part in this movie, I don't think it was big enough. I'm glad that she was in the movie, though. Her acting outshined even Sean. I was hoping that at the end, Sean's character would hook up with Michelle Pfeiffer's, but that didn't happen. That was pretty disappointing as well. It's really not that bad of a movie, but it's not the best. If you really want to see Dakota shine, try watching Uptown Girls..great movie."
5,Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer are wonderful in this!,I Am Sam gave me new respect for Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer. It's a wonderful film with a story that'll touch your heart. See it with your family. My only question is why didn't this get an Oscar?
5,Wonderful!!!,"""I Am Sam"" is a wonderful movie. Never mind what all the ""Movie Reviewers"" say. Please go and see it for yourself. You will not leave without feeling good. Oh, bring kleenex--there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Even my husband!"
5,I am Sam,I loved this movie! I am great friends with a mother of an m/r child. This movie really puts it into perspective when looking into the future. The sad thing is that what happened to Sam and his daughter really happens. The entire theater was packed full of crying men and women. This is a great movie for the soft at heart. I recommend this movie to anyone and don't let the hard core movie reviewers tell you different. 5 stars from me!
1,What a piece ...,"I went into this movie with a completely open mind. I am a big Sean Penn fan and have even learned to tolerate Michelle Pfeiffer. This movie is a [not what I expected]. I don't think that I have ever seen a movie which treated the viewer more like an idiot than this movie does. We are lead to believe that Sam has the intellect of a 7 year old but throughout the film he uses terms such as ""harass"", ""constancy"", among others, appropriately and with a certain level of sophistication. If you are really looking for a movie that undermines your intellect and treats you as the one that is intellectually challenged then this is the one for you. If not....skip the movie and get the soundtrack....the only worthwhile piece of this production."
5,Sean Penn is Simply Amazing!,"With the exception of a few bad words, this movie was a good teaching vehicle for my nine year-old son Ryan who has a severely autistic seven year-old brother. It showed the acceptance that is possible with mentally retarded(pardon the outdated term) individuals. It also showed how society often completely misinterprets the behavior of special people, like my son.Beatle's soundtrack wonderfully done, the whole movie was a very moving stream of consciousness. How could a person not have more respect for the acting of Sean Penn after this one?? Even though Sean is in a lot of ""tough guy movies,"" he is to be praised for this one! I hope he attempts more ambitious roles...I would love to see him portray an autistic man, or maybe appear as Charley Gordon in a re-make of ""Flowers for Algernon.""Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
5,I am S,"This is one of my favorite movies! When my children were very young, I used to read ""Green eggs and Ham"" to them and this movie makes me feel good every time I watch it."
1,Shouldn't have been surprised...,"Robert Downey Jr. was right when he said in the movie Tropic Thunder: ""Never go full retard"". Penn disregarded this advice at his own peril."
2,"Better watch ""Rain Man"" oder ""Forest Gump""","""Rain Man"" starring Dustin Hoffman as an autistic man was a masterpiece, ""Forrest Gump"" starring Tom Hanks was o.k. since it at least contained a certain amount of wisdom, but ""I am Sam"" is not much more than a superficial schmaltzy, kitschy tear-jerker.Two stars for the certainly good acting of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning, but the whole movie itself leaves one somehow unsatisfied."
1,Why actors want to play unfortunate SPED people,"It just has to be for the Academy Award that most actors pretend they don't want but really would do anything and I mean ANYTHING to get. Well, anyway, we all know how talented Sean Penn is but like most of the actors of his generation they have lost their sense of humor and take EVERYTHING far too serious. I really think alot of them have their sights set on political careers. This movie should have worked but it dosen't it was kind of creepy for some reason and even though all the acting was fine. And is Dakota Fanning the only child star in Hollyweird? Because she seems to be in every other movie produced this year. This movie is really for die hard Penn fans. Enjoy!"
4,Almost 5,Very refreshing to hear some originality through out this CD. A lot of fine musicianship going on here. My only gripe is that some of the songs seem to just fade away and end almost like he ran out of thoughts for the music. You expect that it's going to keep going but it just fades away. Too bad. Rather short on time too. 45 minutes or so. Much too short for this good of music in the age of CD's. Quite well engineered too which is more than I can say for his previous Black Utopia. A great CD too but with poor engineering.
3,Mythology CD,This was a christmas gift for my husband. Every year he has a list of CDs he want to add to his ever growing collection (over 1200 CDs now). He said that he really liked this CD. He is a fan of this musician from earlier bands. I would recommend this for anyone who likes this style of music. It was quite mellow in some of the songs which I liked.
5,Good high speed card for most modern cameras,THe Lexar pro 4GB card has plenty of speed and compares quite well with the Sandisk Ultra II. Did not notice that the write speed on the camera was ever slowed down by the card. Keep in mind that you need to have good fast readers to take advantage of the read times for this card. Get a firewire or USB 2 readers.
5,Very good performance and reliability,"Even though Lexar memory cards are less popular than Sandisk's, they are just as good -- if not better. I've used this CF card extensively in my Olympus E-520 and it has proven itself fast and trustworthy. No trouble in any card reader either, be it the desktop computer's or an external one (such as a Sandisk, which I use with my laptop). The price difference between this Lexar and, say, a Sandisk Extreme III isn't big, but for some reason I now see Lexar products as more professional. I also think (haven't measured, sorry) it is faster. Definitely worth it."
4,C'mon Now....,"The 80s' were a tough time for Kiss, what with losing Peter Criss and Ace Frehley, and the desperate struggle of Gene and Paul to stay with the times and not fade out like so many other bands have. But Kiss proved their staying power and on this record, their musical ability as well."
3,Asylum,"Yes the cover art looks like one from Billy Squier, but there is some good stuff on here. Eric Carr thunders throughout, and if you are a fan of this underappreciated drummer, the CD is worth it just for his licks. I was a big Kiss fan as a kid, but most of the tracks here (like pretty much all of Kiss's songs over their long career)don't really hold up. ""King of the Mountain"" starts out strong, and ""Any Way You Slice It"" is OK, but other than ""I'm Alive"" the rest of the CD just kind of sits there. The singles (and tracks they had videos for) ""Tears Are Falling"", ""Who Wants To Be Lonely?"" and ""UH! All Night"", are good for a nostalgic listen, but you won't be upset if you never hear them again. All that being said, when was the last time you bought an entire CD you loved from front to back? It's pretty rare as groups generally whittle them out as an excuse to tour."
1,The Worst Album In KISSTORY!,"That is if you do not count ""Carnival Of Souls"" as a KISS album. This album began the real downfall of KISS in the mid-80s. Some of the worst songwriting in KISStory matched with the lack of talent from Bruce Kulick make for one sorry album. Seems KISS agreed the album stuck since only 2 songs were part of the regular set list during the Asylum tour."
2,"Awful cover, awful feel and sound to this wanna be...",For this wanna be hair metal albums. It is an odd assortment of misses with a few diamonds in the rough. Bruce Kulick's first album... you can hear the Van Halen-esque guitar and an obviously forced sound from him. Other than the three videos released from this album all of the other songs are pure filler! Definatley a misguided effoert. You can tell Gene has more input on it( compared to Animalize). This album is for collectors and completeists only! You can get the good stuff on compilations... Don't email me about that comment! Highest point--> Tears Are Falling.
2,Back to the roots....???,"I remember when KISS was in the Studio recording Asylum...The said this album was getting back to their roots.... Now over 20 years later , nothing was more wrong. This is no way going back to old Kiss stuff. Has to be one of the worst Kiss efforts ever. Only Smashes is worse."
3,Asylum marked the end of an era,"I remember 1985. First thing I thought upon looking at the horrible artwork was 'God, I hope the music will speak for itself'. Well, needless to say, it turned out to be only the wishful thinking of a 16-year-old fan. The music didn't sound convincing as the band got sadly immersed - and then lost - in the 80's unbelievable mindless acts. This wasn't the Kiss I liked and I was right. Asylum marked the end of an era as Kiss had again to reinvent itself on the more polished and keyboard-driven Crazy Nights two years after. This was the last drop for the Kiss which had started with the excellent Creatures Of The Night in 1982. And what's funny, being the huge fan I am, I've been secretly trying to make myself enjoy Asylum for 24 years now... and counting!"
2,Not Bad But Far From Good,I've heard worse albums so this one is not too bad.With the songs Tears Are Falling and Who Wants To Be Lonely at least Paul Stanley is trying to write decent material.Anyway You Slice It is actually the best Gene Simmons song of the unmasked period.The rest is drivel.
3,Very Interesting guy,"I haven't actually heard the CD yet, but I'm buying it as I write this. My son and I saw Ian perform at the Portland Blues Festival in July and we both liked what we heard. Neither of us were fans of his kind of music, we just stopped by his stage on the way out. However, he is VERY unique and does understand the difference between singing and performing and seems to like his work. That was enough to keep us listening for a while and we found ourselves appreciating his stuff. He is very true to his genre, yet still plays with it in a funny way. He can alter the speed of either the lyrics or the music and still somehow not alter the flow of the song itself. Anyway, we decided we needed to hear more of his stuff."
5,Entomophagy= person who eats insects,"This is a great book! In a review I read it said that the book had a picture in every page, and at first I thought that it was an exaggeration, but it isn't! And the pictures are fabulous. It's a very enlightening book, and it provides food for thought. I highly recommend it."
1,major suckage.,Okay. I listened to these samples.And they really suck.These singers' voices...they don't even compare to the ones of [...]. It saddens me.Please. Don't buy this piece of [...].
2,Not really,This book didn't capture my interest as most of Jane Austen's books do. I did read it through but most likely won't again
2,Not her best work,"Ridiculous and melodramatic. Lots of spelling errors. The plot seemed to go 'round in circles, if it went anywhere at all."
2,A very immature work of a wonderful writer,"There's a reason this did not appear during the author's lifetime. It was a juvenile piece, never intended for publication outside the family. It's typically self-conscious and very knowing. Written by a teenager, I recommend it only to die-hard Austen fans and scholars, and even we have to admit it's not great work!"
5,Your second book of classical music,"This book is a small treasure, especialy if you are appreciating classical music but want to learn more about it. The book tells the intriguing life stories of 50 composers (some would argue if all are realy 'great', but everybody will find some of their liking) and recommends various levels of building a classical library (starting with 5 recordings and up to 20 recommended recording - hence the title reference to 1000 recording). You can use the book to find more composers you may like, more recordings of your favourite composers or just as a good reading book. Highly recommended"
5,"if there was a rating over 5 stars, this would be a zillion!","First off, this book and the fire within are both worth a million dollars! I read this book and it was the best book I read in the world. This is a book i will cherish throuout my life. I used to think A Series of unfortunate events was best, but not anymore! This book is like all of those mixed with all harry potters! I highly recommend this book if you like animals. Especialy dragons. I have read this and the fire within about 3 times and am on my 4 time on The Fire Within. I am waiting intil October of 2005 for the 3rd book. I cant wait for it! I cant wait what awaits David and his friends. In the mean time, Gadzooks says hrrr."
4,Conscious music to ride to,"I'll be concise: This is socially conscious, political lyrics set to hard beats. Its as good or better than ""Let's Get Free"" Get it."
5,Perfect compilation of Tom Jones classics !,"Not a throwaway track here. Excellent remastering. You can listen to Tom forever without getting tired of his voices and catchy tunes. The greatest hits of a great entertainer. By the way, he still puts on a fabulous live show, if you get a chance to catch him in concert by all means - GO !"
3,Grinding It Out!,"Frank Sinatra was 59 when he came into Madison Square Garden. In his book ""Sinatra"", Will Friedwald reports that this event was shot in pieces by a TV crew and patched together for the TV special The Main Event. He quotes saxist Jerry Dodgion ""every time Sinatra was ready to go into a song, the director would start and stop endlessly. Sinatra couldn't build up his usual momentum because of the TV crew."" With all the these interruptions, Sinatra lost the spontaneity of his live performances. Even though his adoring fans overreact to every gesture and move, he sounds tired and eager to end things. Frank Sinatra had been taking good care of his fans and audiences for 35 years with his masterful and unique take on The Great American Songbook. Who was taking care of him on this one?"
2,Where's the Camp?,"I have seen a slew of campy Joan Crawford movies recently, many of the so-bad-they're-brilliant ilk (Strait-Jacket, Sudden Fear), a few with memorable one-liners but not enough to become kitsch classics (Torch Song, Queen Bee, Female on the Beach) but I found Autumn Leaves utterly disappointing. The first half of this film is boring and becomes stagnant to the point of wanting to fast-forward. I kept hoping for some over-the-top histrionics which are a Crawford trademark. The only satisfaction I got was from the typewriter scene listening to her odd, gurgling wails, and the encounter with Vera Miles and Lorne Greene outside her bungalow. If you're looking for camp, watch Strait-Jacket again, and avoid Autumn Leaves."
2,Not Quite,"The dangles are poorly made and are very stiff. while trying to adjust, one of the stones fell out. Super glued it back in and still wore them. They look nice though. (I had a matching necklace)"
4,Airs & Graces,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It reminded me of a Rosamunde Pilcher book. Thumbs up!
3,Album holds several gems...,"The title of this album is misleading because most of these songs were not hits for Sinatra. ""My Way,"" and ""September of My Years,"" being the hits. The rest are fine covers of contemporary numbers ""Goin' Out Of My Head,"" and ""Somethin'"" Sinatra surely made something out of ""Something,"" much better than the original.The rare recording here is ""Star,"" I have not been able to find it anywhere else, and is probably worth the price of this album alone, I really like this song, it is very classy, very much a Sinatra song.""Love's Been Good To Me,"" and ""A Man Alone"" are excellent songs, and Sinatra gives fine performances.Reprise could have also included Sinatra's 1969 recording ""Forget To Remember"" to even out the 11-song album. The latter is a very moving performance and would have fit nicely here.This is a good album for a new Sinatra fan."
3,"Sweet story, but Rick Schroeder's is the real tearjerker","Please, oh please, find the Rickey Schroeder version of this movie for all of us."
3,Not one of her best,"I like Phillippa Gregory's books but this one was not one of her best. However, the basic story is entertaining and it does keep your interest fairly well. She looks at British society through the eyes of a lower class girl who is suddenly having to deal with conventions which are uncomfortable and difficult for her to understand. Family secrets tear apart the home. Of course, there is a crisis which is resolved somewhat to the satisfaction of all.Not a bad read but she has done better with her other works."
2,Scientist written. God awful reading experience.,"I love Dr. Seuss. Sadly, this doesn't appear to be his writing. I'm pretty sure his brand name was pimped out to a scientist. There's no excuse for writing this bad. The author has no sense of verse and his writing style has no rythym to it. In fact, some of the ultra-scientific sentences are so long and incomprehensible, your toddler will have no idea what the freak you are talking about, and neither will you. This was clearly written by a scientist, not a true writer. I'm giving it two stars only because the illustrations are nicely done. Rather than this book, you should buy ""If I Ran the Zoo,"" which is classic Seuss at his best, flows beautifully, and has many hilarious pages (""...in the northwestern corner of east South Dakota"" makes my family lose it every time.)"
1,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--HOAX!,"H. P. Lovecraft was a brilliant, gifted author...OF FICTION!Which is what this **is**!!***FICTION!***The Necronomicon *was* and *is*...FICTION!!The lumpen buffoons who can't get this into their rattling noggins, whether New Age Ninnys or Stone Age Evangelicals, belong in the nut hatch!UPDATE_____________To cure the false idea that Lovecraft believed in his ***fictional*** creations, I suggest you read Lovecraft's biography--Lovecraft: A BiographyOr the two volume biographyI Am Providence: The Life and Times of H. P. Lovecraft (2 VOLUMES)Or, read Lovecraft's very own words on his beliefs--Against Religion: The Atheist Writings of H.P. LovecraftH.P. Lovecraft was an ATHIEST. He denied the supernatural in all forms, & did not believe in magic."
1,Moot point...,"I can't believe this book was even written. Considering that Lovecraft INVENTED the Necronomicon for his writings makes EVERYTHING written about this so-called real grimoire completely moot. It's like writing about finding the Emerald City of Oz in the Utah desert. And for those who still believe that the book really existed... you have got to stop deluding yourself and finding laughable ways and theories to prove that it really existed! I have been a Lovecraft fan for over 18 years and own everything he has produced, so of course I picked up the ""original"" Simon Necronomicon when it came out. In trade paperback, of course. I mean, how dangerous could it be? It has an ISBN number! And we all know what a joke that book was. So please, if you want entertainment and a damn good read, then read something by Lovecraft. If you want to continue to delude yourself, by all means, read this book and have fun."
5,Best Toy in the world !,It was great Inever had a toy like this! the claws opend and closed the tentacles move ! The arms and legs move like real.
5,Terrific.,"Read this 20 years ago, and read it recently again. Filled with insight, humor, irony, intelligence, piece of literary and social history without being heavy and laborious. A winner in every respect. As I matured,it matured!"
4,"Looks good, but will it hold up to the months of school?","I bought it because i wanted a cheap, but good looking backpack. With shipping it was around 30 dollars. School is starting in nine days so i haven't tried using it when it is full of books."
2,Plaid Backpack ....zipper issues,"DD picked out this backpack for school. The size is perfect, however, the zipper is a nightmare. The main pouch zipper broke the first week and doesn't close. Her backpack is constantly open because of a bad zipper, and school work falls out and gets lost. This is my first High Sierra backback and am wondering if they have quality issues."
3,High Sierra FAT BOY,"A very nice, decent quality pack for the price. The only con is that the compression straps use friction type buckles, not quick-disconnect clips. You must loosen the straps (you can't easily undo them) for easier access to the interior compartments . . . slow and cumbersome. This was not apparent on the web page, but if you look at the pics where the pack is shown with a partially open compartment, the straps are clearly still buckled for that reason.UPDATE: Re-visited the website (3 months later) for this pack and noticed that all the pics but one were eliminated. The available pic shows the pack closed only (naturally)."
4,"Very Good, but has loose threads","This bookbag is very nice. It holds a lot of books and is comfortable to carry around. I like the pockets and the two giant compartments...very cool! However, there seems to be a lot of loose threads, and i have to cut them. Other than that its a good bookbag."
4,Fat Boy Backpack review,"My son likes the backpack because it rides comfortably on his shoulders and holds everything he needs it to. The side straps occasionally get in the way of the zippers, but he is able to work around it."
1,Very frustrating design,The straps on the side meant to make the backpack more compact get in the way whenever trying to zip and unzip. I would much rather have bought a North Face backpack.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this backpack based off the reviews saying it held a lot of books/laptop/etc. When it got here, I was not sure that the folks who wrote the reviews were looking at the same bag as I was. I currently use a Code Alpha bag that has tons of room. I was hoping that this would at least compete with the bag I currently have. No such luck. This bag is an AVERAGE sized backpack. I work 12 hour shifts, where I bring schoolbooks, books for work and lunch/snacks in everyday. This bag would maybe hold my lunch and a single book.It does appear to be well made and looks good, but with the name ""Fat Boy"", I just expected a larger bag."
1,garbage,This backpack was delivered at the end of January and by the end of April was falling apart. My daughter has used it quite normally back and forth from school and she's not particularly rough with her things. Two seams have split open and the binding along the edge of one shoulder strap has come off.
1,Not Free SF Reader,"This book was not in the able to be finished category. How did this talent come up with such ordinary junk. Too many cooks in this case, I think.Time after time when the characters did something I would think 'what the hell is up with that'. Not really a good sign. Many useless princesses."
2,Black Trillium,"""Black Trillium"" is an exercise in mediocrity and cliches. It's got all the elements of formula fantasy. Three spunky princesses, one evil king with an evil sorcerer as his sidekick, an ancient sorceress mentor, bits of technology left over from a vanished civilization, magic doohickies, quests, true love, and a climactic showdown where the good guys win and the bad guys are all killed. I normally try to write longer, more in-depth reviews, but with this book it's simply not worth it. The three authors who produced this are all capable of better work. There's simply no excuse for this book."
1,overrated!,"There is no secret in this book, buy another book!! the only 3 las chapters are worth it."
5,A Must For Any Serious Writer,"If there is one thing that seems to stump writers, it is putting their book ideas into a proposal format that will make editors eager to see more of their writing. Terry Whalin's previous position as acquisitions editor for a major publishing house plus his ongoing writing experience give him a unique vantage point in the publishing industry.In BOOK PROPOSALS THAT SELL, Terry draws from his experiences on both sides of the editorial desk to share successful methods for coming up with great book ideas and then for writing proposals that will spark an editor's interest.BOOK PROPOSALS THAT SELL is a must-buy for any writer who is serious about getting their work published."
5,Amazing and Different,"I am a huge Neil Young fan and this album, along with UNPLUGGED, is my favorite. Every song is wonderful. You should definitely buy it...NOW."
3,Eugenic errors and racist stereotyping mar an OK tale.,"Heinlein should have the scientific good sense to distinguish true Darwinism (i. e. the thery of evolution as understood by legitimate science) from the Wagnerian qausi-fascist pop myths about nature being a big Conan slug-fest in which the most brutal destuctive organism wins. It is his perogative to consider right-wing anarchists as ""superior"" in some sense but it has nothing to do with Darwin's observations about sucessful breeding. The novel is clever, like all of his work, but it is hard for me to appreciate a novelist who has turned himself into such an apologist for violence. For him violence is the nature of life. Peace lovers are fools. And yet it is the industries of peace that provide food and shelter and comfort. Neutral nations that use force only to defend their borders are more secure than vast empires. War only destroys life and makes it less likely that our children and grandchildren will survive."
2,Unlikeable protagonist and blatant soapboxing,"I'm a big fan of Heinlein in general -- both pre- and post- ""Stranger in a Strange Land"". I've read nearly all of his novels, and enjoyed them all -- except for this one. I had a problem with how unlikeable the ""hero"" was and how unrealistic his interactions with the other characters were. Usually I like character motivation and behavior to flow with the plot more realistically, even in fantastic situations like science fiction novels. That didn't really happen for me with this book, though. The ""hero"" seemed to be there more as a mouthpiece for a political philosophy, and that kind of soapboxing by an author often overshadows the story itself. It certainly did in this case for me. I wouldn't recommend this as your first Heinlein novel."
1,What a complete and utter desecration,I can't believe the Lewis estate authorised this expoitation.What next: The Bible II?
2,Not their best,"For those who are familiar with the earlier work of Mountain, this one is a major disappointment. Although both Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi are here, neither is in top form, and Alan Schwartzberg proves that he is no Corky Laing. Much like John Bonham, Corky Laing played a significant role in defining the sound of his band; Schwartzberg is mediocre in comparison. Bob Mann adds nothing to the mix, and is about as inconspicuous (and insignificant) as Steve Knight. The performances are ragged, and Felix sounds especially tired (or bored). The half-hour-plus rendition of ""Nantucket Sleighride"" is overblown, ridiculously long, and boring. There is nothing here that hasn't been done much better somewhere else, making this a must for completists only."
4,Cards R Fun,"I am just learning to work with this product, ""Hallmark Card Studio 2005 Deluxe...I am enjoying what I can do with it so far."
1,-Save your money,The third disc doesn't talk to the computer so I wait and get a message not responding. I call the software company. The gentleman said just send it back and they will send a new one. I took it to the postoffice and it cost me 1.74 and a jewelcase to send it back. I sent it March and got one back in May. Now I go through the job of uninstalling the first two disc because by it self no program came up to install it. I started reinstalling the software from the beginning and what do you know the third disc wasn't responding again. Now what do I do. This is expensive software but how many times do you keep sending back the 3rd disc and it still doesn't work.
1,One Of The Worst Kiss Albums,This is definitely almost at the top of the pile when it comes to the worst Kiss Albums. I can't believe this is rated half a star better than unmasked which is a solid record. I would not call this glam/hair metal this is more in tune to Michael Bolton than Motley Crue.On the other hand if you like Michael Bolton then this will be a feast for your ears.
3,Good Album With Great Songs,"In 1987, KISS released their 4th non-makeup album ""Crazy Nights"". This album has great contributions on the lyrics by Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick. Of course Gene and Paul write most of the songs but with Eric and Bruce helping to co-write this album came out with smashes. ""Crazy Crazy Nights"", ""Reason To Live"", ""Turn On The Night"". This album is an all-time classic."
4,Lighten up and get ready to rock,"I must admit that I really like this one. I'll agree it's probably the least heavy Kiss album besides Dynasty and Unmasked, but it's awfully fun. Basically, they tried to be Bon Jovi and Def Leppard who were hot at the time and for my money this is much better than both of them. Most of the songs are Paul's and they are fast, polished, and fun. If you don't want to sing along with Crazy Crazy Nights, Bang Bang You, Reason to Live, and Turn on the Night then you really take yourself and your music way too seriously. Gene's song's are good, but they're not the usual 'demon' inspired stuff that would have made this a perfect 5 star disk. This is the first Kiss album I ever got - I have them all now and I still find myself listening to this one a lot some 12 years later."
1,A laugh Riot.....,"Possibly the Worst album in the history of Rock. So Wimpy it may damage the laser in your CD player. Download Reason to Live, ignore the rest. Only Asylum is worse in the Kiss Catalog."
4,Crazy Nights Delivers the goods,This is a great album. Yes you can hear the 80's pop metal influences but what's wrong with that. The anthemic title track is awsome. Reason to Live is a great ballad. On the whole a great listen that will get you moving and feeling good.
4,Great 80's album.,"OK I've read the other review about the embarrassment to listen to certain songs on this album when company comes over. However, if you knew me and it was on when I came over, I'd become your best friend. I love this album! I had never heard it until this past year. I love the sound of the 80's with the big melodic chorus's and 1,4,5 chord progressions that make music simple to listen too. However this album isn't just that. It's got it's edgy Kiss sounding songs too. This album as well as the other albums Kiss brought out in the 80's seems to have a KISS philosophy behind them all. The KISS philosophy to a musician is KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID!!!! The less is more theory. If you like the big hair band sounds of the 80's, you'll love this album. I play this one with Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Journey, and this album. Makes for a great day!"
5,Italy loves Tom Jones,"I went to Italy in March of 2000, and became familiar with the Tom Jones ""Reload"" CD. It was playing in every bar and night spot, especially in Venice. I couldn't find it in stores when I came back to Dallas-and ordered it on Amazon. This CD is hot, it has style and even though I thought Tom Jones was dead-I dig it!"
2,ridiculusly too small for little hands.,I got this for my four year old grandson. The log doesn't stay on neither does anything else. I was amazed at how tiny it is. I think he's just going to pay with the log by itself. So I thought it was a waste of money.
5,Works Well,"Works well & Is Potent. I Recommend it to anyone who knows how to use wormwood. Peace, Love, Absinthe (:"
4,VERY good!,"At the very least, the writing style is lively and accessible. This is a book you can enjoy reading just for the insights on moviemaking, even if screenwriting isn't your thing. Epstein doesn't really blow away a lot of major sacred screenwriting cows here, but he does offer a lot of very practical, very realistic advice about writing and selling screenplays. He displays an insight not usually found in most books like what ""The dialogue is flat"" REALLY means.One of my favorite comments is when he talks about backstory in action films, pointing out that you progressively decrease the dialogue and ""increase the whammies."" As for recommending screenwriting books, he says ""Stop reading and get writing!"" Excellent advice!"
5,Read this book first!,"Smart, literate, and funny in just the right places, Epstein is a refreshing combination of Muse and Marketer. Too many books offer only ""how to write it"" or ""how to sell it,"" but Crafty Screenwriting covers them both, and more. It's great for beginners but also for experienced screenwriters who might need a refresher course on the fundamentals."
5,Very informative and practical advice.,"I have purchased many, many screenwriting books over the years, and Epstein's is one of the few that offer very practical advice on the aspects of screenwriting. He covers the topics that are important, and does not waste words on flowery prose or long explinations. It's a bit like ""guerrila screenwriting"" in that he goes against conventional wisdom, and for a struggling or brand new screenwriter working on spec, it was refreshing and it works."
4,THE VOICE THAT REJECTED A THOUSAND WORKS,"No nonsense book, sly, satirical and funny, destructive or realest viewpoint of the profession. This is the rage in showbiz. I enjoyed it and like his approach."
2,I would LOVE to punch him out,"In the first place, I am FROM Atlanta, Georgia, and I AM PROUD TO BE FROM THE SOUTH! And if liberal-guilt Randy don't like it, he can...(I can't say it, Ammy won't publish it) And I have played @ the bar where the cover pic was taken...it's an Ethiopian restaurant now. When are you liberals just going to let it go? And ref the ""song"" ""Rednecks"" from this POS, we DO know our +++ from a hole in the ground!"
1,my review,"I don't feel like going through my detailed explanation of whyI think this CD and the rest of Randy Newman's material is extremelyover-rated and hyped beyond belief (and still lacking in wide-spread appeal). Briefly, his piano work is hardly more than cabaret style cliches. His voice is abominable. His melodies are either unattractive or again, cliche-ridden. I haven't concentrated on his lyrics, so maybe that's what all the fuss is about. If it's about the music, I can't understand it."
2,"Loved it, but...","Bought this purse right after the holidays and it arrived on Jan. 8th. Loved it loved it loved it!!! Until right before Valentine's Day. The chain attached to the back (used to hook the flap closed) came apart. As I was emptying it out to send back for an exchange, I noticed that the inside seams - on both sides at the top- were torn about an inch or so and fraying. So I decided to just return it. It was a gorgeous bag, but for having it only a month it shouldn't have come apart like that. Don't know if it was in the seller's warehouse for too long, or if it was a manufacturing issue or what. Had it held up, I'd have given it a 5 star rating."
4,weezer will always be good,"people bashing certain Weezer albums shouldn't judge to harshly. so what if every song off Make Believe doesn't sound exactly like 'Undone' or 'Buddy Holly'? like every band, Weezer's style changes a bit from album to album, and i think Make Believe is just another good, listenable album. (and also for the record, Maldroit is a damn good CD) =w="
4,One of the best albums !!!,"This album stands on its own. It doesn't have to be compared with their past albums. Yeah, maybe there's some changes; But it all boils down to how long will you play this CD...And I bet that you would. Why? For simple reason that this album grows into you. You don't need to be a genius to follow the lyrics. It's very catchy and will leave you wanting more. I only gave 4 stars though coz I'm thinking there should have been more tracks added to it. It's way too short..hahaha..Nevertheless, it's an awesome album. I bought a lot of CD lately and only a handful is worth listening to. This one is different. Every single track has its own identity. Go buy it!!!"
2,Bitterly Disappointing,"Some intangible quality that has graced Weezer's music over the first eight years of their career has been lost on this release. It's not so much the lyrics that sag (save ""My Best Friend"" a cringing ode on par with Bobby McFerrin's ""Don't Worry, Be Happy""), it's the music that just sinks into oblivion. There are a few redeemable moments, heard in ""Perfect Situation"" and ""Pardon Me,"" but two decent songs on a comparatively epic 12-track release is less than one would expect."
2,Say It Ain't So,"First off, I am a big weezer fan and have been since the blue album. I do, however, know that bands change and adapt and grow musically so let me also say that I don't expect this album to be another blue album or pinkterton or green album etc... I just want good music. This album is mediocre at best and leaves me unsatisfied. There are some bright spots on the album but gone are the days where every track is worth listening to. I am not one to hate a song because of the lyrics; it's the music on ""Make Believe"" that doesn't deliver. It's not a complete disaster but it's definitely their worst release to date. It just seems flat and unoriginal even though the lyrics deal with emotional issues. ""Make Believe"" seems to be a hit and miss with their fans. If you're a big fan, you're probably going to buy the album no matter what. If you're on the fence, definitely check it out before you buy."
4,A Solid Slab Of Weezer,"To date, Weezer have not released a perfect album; there are always a few clunkers, but the good stuff always seems to compensate. Thankfully, this is the case with ""Make Believe"".Rebounding off the ""Pinkerton"" aspersions that plagued ""Maladroit"", and the uniformity of ""The Green Album"", they've changed the flavour of the band while simultaneously remaining true to their overall sound. 'Beverly Hills' is a re-write of Steve Miller's 'The Joker', but it's so infectious, nobody will take the time to give a damn.The album plows through with some great melodies--'Pardon Me', 'Hold Me', and 'Peace', and Cuomo puts more passion into this release than he has in quite a while. Though it remains to be seen how well this LP will age, it's still a good starting point for anybody just discovering Weezer, and equally good for fans who've shuffled off elsewhere in the interim."
5,Thank You,"Finally an album Weezer put out that matches their potential. Its silly to compare this album to blue and pinkerton because no album can match what they had, and why should they try, its not 1996. Make Believe is the best ive heard Weezer in a long time, and we as fans need to appreciate that. The songs on this album are about as personal as Rivers Cuomo is going get. If you dont like this album perhaps this band is not for you."
1,Rediculous!,"I agree with reviewer Gene Bean. This work of trash would be considered overly woo woo even by the people living in Hawai'i or California. I mistakenly thought it was a factual book about parallel universes via theoretical physics. The author has a Ph.D. which she reminds you of on every other page. I did a little research about her on the web. Her degree is in parapsychic science, whatever that is... a contradiction in terms if ever there was one. This stuff is over the top craziness. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this pamphlet."
1,"""Beyond Reality' - an apropos title","This book is a piece of literary trash. At 5 inches by 7 inches and 130 pages of size 12 type, it can be read in an evening. But what a waste of an evening! It contains nothing more than anecdotal stories from grade c sci-fi movies. No facts or scientific discussion-just a lot of BS falderal. No wonder there are NO recommendations by her peers. The reader would be much better off reading Wolfe or another genuine author."
1,It has all been said already here.,"Too bad I spent money on this audio book, I didn't get through the 2nd chapter. I know a bit about Aquinas and this book is more about putting Christianity down or any belief in God in general. Paul Strathern seems to be one of those uppity, arrogant, presumptuous and ""better than everyone else"" kinda people. Don't waste your money."
1,American colonialist taste!,"American colonialism is a horrible thing. American military and government officials used local peoples (whether they be Vietnamese, Iraqi or Afghanistani) to subjugate the populations of Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. They deprived them of their own resources e.g. oil, and prevented the progress of innocent civilians. I feel this book, written by Kim, is a typical American colonialist response to the tragedy of 9/11. The 9/11 attacks are a direct consequence of the colonialist policies of the United States. This book does nothing to repair the damage wreaked by American colonialists on their imperial crusades against Islam and socialism. Please avoid."
