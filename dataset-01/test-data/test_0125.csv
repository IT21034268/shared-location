2,Disappointing,"Grisham books are not great books but good books that make a long trip seem shorter -- with the exception of The Street Lawyer. It's a simplistic book that, to a certain degree, insults the intelligence of the reader. Homelessness is not a simple issue and while the story premise is quite good, Grisham fails to deliver a credible story or give new insight to the problems of homelessness. Finally, you can predict ending just by reading the jacket cover."
2,Too Slow,"I have read most of John Grishams books except the Testament. I felt the street lawyer was not at his regular pace of his previous books. The theme was quite good but there was nothing to look for, no suprises anywhere in the book. Once he mentioned the plot in the beginning, nothing new happened"
4,"Finally, a realistic book on law and the homeless","""The Street Lawyer"" was an excellent book, the first Grisham novel that I've read the whole way through. The intricacy of details in the novel are extremely important, for they reveal the horrofic and uplifting world that the main character finds himself in. I enjoyed the rapid changes that roared through the main character's life, and all the interesting people he met on the way. Mordecai Green, the first ""street lawyer"" that the main character met, (I think his name was Mike), was a hilarious and courageous man. The witty dialogue that takes place between Mike's former firm, Drake & Sweeney, and Mike was etched with suspense and satirism. And, as usual, the media rules the day in this novel, and Grisham observes the media with a thoughtful eye. Bravo!"
2,THE TYPICAL GRISHAM FORMULA,"With the interesting twist of championing the rights of the homeless, this is the standard Grisham novel. Young lawyer suddenly becomes disenchanted with the law and decides to trade in his riches and fame for moralistic reasons. I used to think Grisham was capable of much more than that. Maybe he should write a book about a talented author with a commercially successful formula who decides to write something original, and not cash in on a 'paint by numbers' writing formula."
3,Grisham-Lite,"Grisham seemed to be more interested in writing a good treatise on the homeless than a good novel. While the story moves along at a fast pace, he barely attempts to go below the surface in developing the plot and characters. There are no surprises, but it does hold your interest."
3,"Good Social Commentary, But That's About It","Do not read this book if you are looking for an exciting legal thriller like Grisham's other novels. The primary focus of the novel is the plight of the homeless. The story line is dull, and the ending is predictable. As to the social commentary, you may or may not agree with it. The more conservative will think Grisham's universal portrayal of the homeless as helpless victims is misguided. The more liberal will say he's right on."
2,Disappointing,"I have read several Grisham books and I think he is a wonderful writer. This one, however, went into the recycle bin after page 100. It seemed contrived and the political comments kept pulling me out of the story. It also made me wonder how, in view of his preaching, Mr. Grisham can justify owning two homes when there are people out there with none?"
2,This book is laughable,"My wife and I laughed out loud listening to this book. When we weren't laughing, we were cringing at the preachy Kumbaya liberal politics of the author, who is now rich enough to afford the liberal policies he supports. Apparently, Grisham is salving his guilty conscience by having his alter-ego help fictional homeless people. If Grisham feels so strongly about the homeless, why doesn't he become a ""Street Author"" and donate his millions to charity? Oh I forgot -- liberals are only compassionate with other people's (tax) money. Two stars for the unintended humor."
2,Formula Grisham,"A hot-shot lawyer (sound familiar?) is well on the road to success (still sound familiar?), until he becomes a hostage victim. Once released, he uncovers a terrifying secret (familiar, huh?) about his captor--a secret that leads back to his own law firm (now where have I read that before?). A decent writer, Grisham phones in his standard legal-thriller formula, and lets his desire to infuse the story with his liberal political leanings cloud the plot. Skip this one."
2,Disappointing,"as a Grisham fan I was disappointed in this book. I also recently read his newest Playing For Pizza and I found that 10 times more fulfilling.If you're a devot Grisham lover, this may be worth your time. But then again, you'd probably be better off reading pizza.Playing For Pizza: A Novel"
4,My First Grisham Book,Since this is the first book of his that I have read I cannot compare it to other works. In my opinion though it was nothing great. I had a hard time getting through it at first although and as it went on I found myself glued to it...wanting to find out what happens to the characters. I did think some aspects were very unrealistic though as I saw another poster mention. I'd suggest you read it but don't expect something great.
3,"Mixed emotions--some good stuff, some not-so-good","I liked the altuistic theme and the glimpse into the world of the homeless, but it does drag in the middle and ends rather abruptly. Then again, I find most of Grisham's later novels do that. The characters could have been better developed. Nevertheless, something kept me reading on, turning the pages, and I wasn't sorry I did. The magic of Grisham, I guess."
4,The Street Lawyer,"Once again we see a lawyer who is about to make a lot of money but all of a sudden finds a truckload of trouble. Michael Brock is on his way to partnership in a huge DC firm but gets a little compassionate and takes a big paycut, a divorce, smaller apartment and everything that goes along with taking a 90k cut in his annual income. He goes into DC's worst streets to help the homeless and the poor in general. The novel overall is good, giving us a view of the homeless, but is a bit extensive with the confidential file. Great book but not near the caliber of ""The Partner"" or ""The Firm""."
4,"The street lawyer offers excitement, emotion","""The Stree Lawyer"" by John Grisham is among a dying breed of books: the good kind. It offers everything from a twinge of romance to near-death passages that demand attention and captivate the imagination. Grisham has outdone himself this time: hardly ever does one author capture the classic fall-from-rags-to-riches story in such a way that it is almost believable. The story is amazing, the plot lines impeccable, the hero noble, the causes just. ""The Street Lawyer"" is a must-read for everyone. Kudos to Grisham!"
2,"Had a good start,but soon fizzled out!",The book had an excellent start but the plot soon ran out of steam.It seemed that Grisham had run out of ideas.The book just did not have that gripping feel that I had come to expect of Grisham's books.Hopefully his latest book The Testament will be better.
3,Pretty decent,"I bought it mostly because I like Charlie Laine who has two scenes. The 1st is almost too dark & she's moving around pretty fast which makes it hard to get a good look at her, not that you can't. The 2nd one is awesome. Her breasts litterally glisten as she bathes with probably the worst of the 5 girls on the DVD. There's one more than on the box & the one not pictured may actually be the 2nd best one IMO.I didn't like most of them from the box cover but I liked them on the DVD better so if you like the DVD cover, you'll probably like the DVD since I think they look better than the cover might suggest.Only 5 girls makes it a little hard to rate above 3 stars esp. when my favorite is only in 2 scenes but it's a good solid softcore video. About the same risque factor as one of the later playboy video calendars with probably a LITTLE more focus on down below than Playboy which generally doesn't go there much esp. pre-2000."
4,Just what we wanted,"After choosing this DVD, we found it just what we were looking for. Nice choices of fire and the Blu-ray makes it even nicer. We can not wait to view it at night while reading book with the crackling audio and background music playing."
1,Very disappointed in Pilsner glasses,The glasses were the poorest quality I have ever seen. They were warped in different places in all 4 glasses and I would expect to purchase something of this poor quality at a dollar store. I'll never purchase on line again.
5,Excellent,"Diana Rigg is superb as Mrs. Bradley, the 1920's liberated society woman who solves crimes with the assistance of her chauffeur. Costumes are true to period."
4,The Mrs Bradley Mysteries - Series 1,"Since I obtained the video, everybody I know has been utterly fascinated by the stories. I have long been an enthusiast of Diana Rigg's abilities as an actress and of Gladys Mitchell's stories. Neil Dudgeon who plays Mrs Bradley'S chauffeur, George Moody, is an excellent character actor in his own right. Peter Davison who plays the somewhat bemused Police Inspector Christmas is a suitable foil for Mrs Bradley. As always in these types of stories he gets everything wrong and is put on the right track by Mrs Bradley and George Moody, whom he insists on calling Mr Mooney, which says about all we need to say about this character. There is, of course, another character which is in most of the scenes and that is the Rolls Royce Silver Ghost. What a lovely car!Altogether, this series has wonderful stories, excellent actors and of course the Rolls Royce."
5,Complete and detailed,"Hacker Martin, a very accomplished gunsmith, once said ""it is impossible to write a good book on building the flintlock, and who is fool enough to try using their instructions?"" - Foxfire. This book, however, is more than good enough. It gives detailed instructions and diagrams on every step of building a rifle, from choosing the right wood, to inletting the lock and barrel, to carving and engraving. I've already built a longrifle using this book."
4,made well,"the bus is great, however, my son can not open the door by himself and it would be nice if it didn't have windows, he'd like to put his toys inside so they could ride the bus too."
4,"Madonna, Goddess of Pop","Having been a fan of Madonna for almost twenty years, I thought I knew everything there was to know about her. Well, I was wrong! Barbara Victor has revealed new material on the Material Girl herself! Delving deep into the pysche of the most famous woman in the world, Barbara Victor showcases Madonna's inner-drive and determination to succeed in the international pop arena. I would suggest this book to any true Madonna fans, along with Matthew Rettenmund's ""Encyclopedia Madonnica"" and Michael D. Craig's ""Who's That Girl? The Ultimate Madonna Trivia Book"", to find out everything there is to know about Madonna!"
3,some wonderful songs but be prepared to skip a few,"I can listen to most of the songs on this CD over and over again. Waiting, Shehnai Song, En Mireal del Penal, A Sailor's Life, Abbess Hildegard, and Kafi Noir are all good and often mesmerizing. My favorite is the haunting Love is a Killing Thing.You have to hear Speaking in Tongues III and Speaking in Tongues IV at least once so that you can marvel at Chandra's vocal inventiveness. But you may grow weary of them after a couple listenings. I always skip these songs now.La Sagesse (Women, I'm Calling You) and Woman and Child are two feminist anthems that you'll either love or hate. Depending upon your viewpoint, the lyrics are either profound or sophomoric. I skip them every time. But then, I'm a guy.This is the type of CD that playlists were made for. Edit out the songs you don't like, set the player on continuous play, and enjoy."
5,a summary of experimental music,"""possesion"" is really an album which have spirit in it. Coming from a hard-core background, it takes the free jazz motives and combine them with psychedelic murmurs. A fascinating album which can be spiritual, experimental, dark, meditative and narrative."
3,Few good tips but not worth full price,"I got this book used for $0.01 so can't complain really...However, to me at least 70% of this book is stuff that everyone knows. I mean, if you don't know this you are in serious trouble at work probably...the other 30% is half ""nice to know"" and half ""great tips"".Bottom line this is a nice to have book but I would never pay full price for it. It could have been edited to be half the size if it was up to me."
1,Waste of Time,"This book claims to provide important keys to office communication, but there is nothing ground-breaking here. In fact, it's a disappointing waste of time of the first order, as most of the items covered are mere common sense. If you need help remembering not to refuse a request by your boss by telling him that ""that's not my job"" then, by all means, purchase this book. Otherwise, try one of the 1000s of books out there that can really help you achieve this goal, such as Stephen Covey's ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" or Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""."
4,Expectations,"For me would be very important know from other customers the opinion about the book, how this book help them or why they chosen this book.In fact if this book was helpful.Carlos Lima"
1,Don't waste your time,"In brief, I never realized how incapable David Duchovny is of showing emotion. I'm not a big Minnie Driver fan, but I must say, she would've been much better in this if she wasn't playing against a step above a cardboard cutout."
5,Great Comdey.........,"I liked this movie, the starting does get, sad and then it gets more, silly I loved this movie.....:) it's worth watching."
5,It broke my heart and then it mended it,"This movie can definately break your heart and make you cry but it is also one of those movies that makes you appreciate your life and life of those you love. You realize that you gotta cherish every single moment and you have to be prepared for unexpected such as death and sudden love that may bring you back to life. It's a great movie. It broke my heart and then mended it. Sad, funny, beautiful, heartbreaking, and hopeful at the same time.Recommended watch."
2,Great Movie - Filthy Language -What a Shame,"The story line of this movie is wonderful, heatfelt and touching. The main actors were enjoyable and the spoke such a message about organ donation.HOWEVER, THE MOVIE WAS RUINED BY THE FILTHY LANGUAGE THAT WAS USED. WHY WOULD WRITERS TAKE SUCH A WONDERFUL STORY AND RUIN IT FOR FOLKS WHO WANT NICE CLEAN MOVIES THEY CAN WATCH OVER AND AGAIN.TO MAKE IT WORSE, CHILDREN IN THE MOVIE WERE ALSO USING THIS FILTHY PROFANITY. WHY????? WHAT IS THE POINT?????THIS DID NOT BENEFIT THE MOVIE OR THE STORY LINE ONE BIT!!!! IT HURT THE MOVIE IN MY OPINION....I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE AND HAVE TRASHED IT."
2,"Return ""Return to Me"" to the Store","I can't believe so many people like this movie. I love David Duchovny in X-Files, but this movie just didn't work for him. The movie is boring, predictable, and poorly executed. Don't waste your money buying the DVD because there aren't any neat extras on it--there's one cut scene and the director's commentary, that's it! Better luck next time David."
2,Love Story,"The DVD was excellent as far as the audio and visual goes! It was however a depressing movie! I saw it once on TV and I thought it was OK. I happened to like the actors in the show that's why I bought it.I would not recommend it for anyone, unless they are passionate about seeing Driver, Hunt, Belushi, Duchoveny, and the four fathers."
5,love this movie,"This is a ""Feel Good"" movie. This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and it just makes you feel good. Its sad, and funny and heart warming all at the same time. I highly recommend it."
4,One of the Best Romatic Comedies in Years,"This movie was nothing short of Excellent. Superb acting. A beautiful and fresh story. Recommended to all who not only enjoy romatic comedies, but to those who enjoy movies in general."
1,Movie unviewable,"I choose Return to Me because I love the movie, and have always wanted a copy for myself. I ordered it hoping I would get a good quality movie. The quality is horrible and unviewable. This is the third time I've received orders of a VHS that was unviewable. The first was a VHS of ""Rebecca"" and it was broken and shattered when I received it. The second VHS was ""Seven Brides for Seven brothers"" it was unviewable. The last VHS was ""Return to Me"" and it's unviewable."
5,Favorite,This is a wonderful story of loss and dealing with the grief of a lost loved one. Fun to watch and filled with great characters.
5,A fresh approach to a tired genre...,"Okay, in terms of the plotline- maybe NOT so fresh... But this movie approaches that plot line with some faces that are new to the genre (Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny-- both of whom do a great job), fresh humor (Irish-Italian restaurant-- GOT TO LOVE IT!), and somehow manages to come off NOT feeling like that same romantic-dramedy that you've seen 800 times before... This film is NOT forgettable!Long story short, Mimi Rogers has David Duchovny's dead wife's heart... Neither of them know this, but of course, they meet-- and sparks fly. Will everything work out? Take a guess...But it's not in the plot that this movie succeeds, but in the script, and in the acting, and in the overall feeling of the movie, which is sweet, funny, and fresh!"
3,Loud,"This tether will work well, but when you pull on it with a range finder, pull very slowly because it makes a whiny noise & would definitely scare game away if pulled fast."
1,Taught Tether,Nice idea in theory but the retractable wire is far too taught making it difficult to use in the field especially if game is nearby. Too pricey also. Not particularly pleased.
3,Nothing you cant learn for free!!!,"The DVD does a good job of explaining the CAGED system, but it's nothing you couldn't learn for free on the internet. It's all theory, no real practice techniques. I understood the concept before I bought this and didn't learn anything new."
2,Last Light,"This is the first Andy McNab book that I have read. I doubt I will read another. His writing is not very gripping and the ending is simply a set up for the next book. His repetitive use of some descriptive phrases actually detracted from his writing style. For example, I lost count of the number of times he used the phrase ""threw it down my neck"" to describe eating. The first time was clever. After ten or so, it became irritating."
2,Don't bother,"Chande is a respected technical analyst, but his book is lacking. The trading concepts he brings out are interesting, but the systems themselves are weak. Someone might be able to take his concepts and improve upon them by writing better systems based on his ideas. For example the ""channel-break pullback"" pattern is a very valid concept. The code does not capture, in my opinion, a real life breakout and pullback. To place an arbitrary number of days to buy on a pullback, instead of using conditions to verify the completion of the pullback is like saying the market will always top or bottom after ""n"" number of days.I was very disappointed especially with the high price of the book. These systems will not improve your bottom line. Pass."
4,They don't make them like this anymore...,"...and you'll realize that statement's a pretty sad one once you give this a spin. Excellent songs, but not for most under 17; they just won't get it since all of these songs are older than they are. (For a similar listening experience, try Utopia Parkway by Fountains Of Wayne-less keyboard, but just as good no matter what.)"
4,A Mexican Adventure With The Hardy Boys,"This review refers to the original 1934 version written by Leslie McFarlane.The Hardy Boys, Frank and Joe, along with their dad, Fenton, travel to Mexico to locate a missing witness in oil stock swindle.Along the way, they rescue a kidnapped Mexican boy and get invited to his father's hacienda, where they meet a mysterious Yaqui Indian who aids them on their quest.All the threads come together as the Boys and their father are captured by the murderous Vincenzo and his band of cut-throats.There's plenty of action and adventure here as the Hardy Boys battle their way free and solve the case!"
2,Good if only option,"This book provided the minimal amount of information for the PCAT. In particular, the math review section and practice test sections had very simple math compared to the actual PCAT. Also, a few questions in the practice tests were repeated later in the same test. There is no all inclusive review either, only an outline of what is needed. I found this book helpful, but only to the point to get a general idea of the test layout, not of the actual test material. If there is another option, I would use it next time. If Kaplan makes a book, use theirs."
1,If you wanna get a bad score,"I took the PCAT on 10/23/04 and this book completely screwed me over. Nothing in this book was even on the test. This book is wayy to easy. The PCAT was MUCH harder, comparable at a graduate level. You need to know, calculus, physiology, and organic chemistry, there's not enough time even to think because you need to answer 58 questions in 30 minutes. Use the Kaplan one. This one will give you a bad score GUARANTEED!"
2,Pretty worthless,"I just took the pcat, and this book was not helpful. The biology questions didn't help at all, maybe on one or two questions. Trust me, all of the dopes saying that they got a 99 are either just lying or trying to sell books. Just read your Biology book and chemistry notes, and you will be way better off."
1,What school?,"This dvd over-promises and under-delivers. For an entire 1 1/2 DVDs, all you get is a compilation of great shots at goal that repeat over and over again. If that is what you're after, then this will do. The 2nd half of the 2nd dvd gets into some drills that anyone can come up on their own. Nothing new, nothing different and a whole lot of fluff."
3,Missing songs,"This is a special and much more expensive release of 2 King Crimson Collectors Club releases, Live At Cap D'Agde, 1982 and On Broadway, 1995.You should buy the King Crimson Collectors Club membership instead, because the On Broadway CDs are missing a couple of songs, such as ""Thela Hun Ginjeet"".Other than this, the shows are excellent."
5,must have cd,i have most of these songs on an old album - i don't play my vinyl anymore - i want to preserve it thats why i must have this
4,Title says it all,"This is an introductory book on the basic concepts of business, capitalism and investing. With this as the expecation, the book does a good job in tracing the history of stock investing and describing what business and investing is about."
5,A must for everyone,"Unfortunately we'll have to read through passages where Lynch and Rothchild act like the readers are the 15 year-olds that they originally wrote the book for! There is information in this book that even seasoned investors do not know. Unfortunately it isn't all investment info! Lots of history here, which we really should have been taught when we were entering high school! I would recommend Learn to Earn to anyone. They will learn a lot. If you need to learn how to pick stocks based on earnings, try another book after you are done with this one! By the way, I read where Lynch donates all profits from this book to charity!"
1,Business Primer for Grade School Children,The author seemed to spend more time defending the compensation packages of the poor misunderstood CEOs in this country than on the basics of investing and the markets. I have gotten better information free from mutual fund companies trying to promote their products. If I had been given this as a required reading in high school I would have criticised it as much too basic. Bascially a waste of money!
3,No what I expected.,"In Lynch and Rothchilds' other books they often go into more detail and gives an almost case study analysis of the way he picked stocks and why he picked certain stocks. This book on the other hand was a history of stocks, with the most valuable information being at the end of the book where they give a brief tutorial on how to read financial statements. This is good for beginners but for someone who has any background in accounting or finance they'd be better suited picking up a more advanced book."
1,Inferior to the 1968 production with Julie Christie,"The 1998 production was on WETA on July 21, 1999. After one hour, I was bored and I stopped watching. I wondered how someone, who had not read the book by Thomas Hardy, could possibly understand the story. Nothing to compare with the 1968 production with Julie Christie and Peter Finch. The old movie was magnificent. The story unfolded clearly, easy to understand. I loved it so much that the first thing I did was to buy the book by Thomas Hardy. In the new movie, the story does not flow clearly but keeps jumping all over the place which makes it difficult to follow and understand. The 1998 production is boring and the actors unattractive. Nothing can surpass Julie Christie's beauty and Peter Finch's aristocracy. I rate the 1968 production 5 stars and the new production 1 star."
3,Album serves its purpose,"Still a hot boy, made to put money on turks books.Kenoe does a decent job. Oh yeh hot boy dosent refer to cash money clown you probably just got into the south via mtv over the past year. Stick to the cookie cutter stuff. Get raw and uncut good production (put your rags up kenoe and bg rip it). And turk is from metaire not the no, dollar kinda how like you aren't from north north the mound. You probably not even from memphis. Kenoe and bgizzle still doin it. St. Dirtyburg Florida"
4,good back up drive,"so esay to use, one button back up did all my files and now sits in a safe place for use every 6 months or so, great in the event lighting or other failures as you'll always have a good backup ..."
4,Booklet Missing Pages,"The enclosed booklet is missing pages 9-20, so have the seller verify that the booklet is complete (should be 26 pages). Too late for me. :("
4,Joe lets the piano keys fly.,"Overall, a strong album with one good song after another. I disagree with most of the other reviewers on ""Real Men"". Joe has certainly made a career out of being outspoken, but the song just comes across as being too heavy-handed to the point of being a turn off. Having said that, I love the opening quirky brilliance of ""Another World"". ""Chinatown"", ""Target"", and ""Cancer"" are all great and what can one say about ""Steppin' Out""? I've always loved piano music and bands that put out a lot of it (Steely Dan, Bruce Hornsby). This is good stuff."
5,A wonderful collection,"A very diverse omnibus- note it's from 1939, so do not be disappointed on failing to see more contemporary authors."
1,strange music!,"i have to say: i don't like the lyrics they are too strange! this was only famous because they were funny. well, i think they are not! the riffs are terrible!"
2,The Western musician lacks Indian classical music knowledge,"I was disappointed when my anxiety turned into depression. Clearly the fault lies in the main composer as he is totally oblivious of the south Indian classical music structure. Indian classical music has certain norms and standards that are to be followed. When Srinivas restricts himself to a particular raga, Brooks with his so called infinite guitar touches ""unmelodic scales"" and finds himself aimlessly playing his instrument. I must admit that Srinivas has however played his part very well. Whoever sang the alap for the last song, i must say that he has to better his skills in it!"
4,Classic,"This is a very simple and quick read. Nothing world shattering inside, but as it`s assigned the status of most popular book in Japan, it`s a must for anyone with the slightest interest in things Japanese. Although short, the characters are well-developed. The protagonist is neither hero, nor anti-hero, rather human, and very likeable because of this. Herein probably lies the key to its popularity. The only shame is the ending, which I liken to a 1980`s Honda City. That was car that had a really abrupt rear hatch and looked as if the company had run out of money after designing a perfectly acceptable front and middle part. Same goes for this book. It just ends, and the final threads are tied in one-line sentences. Not the greatest analogy in the world, but it gives you the general idea. Botchan, the hatchback of the literary world. Made for the whole family, easy to drive, not too meaty, but just drops off at the back."
4,80's Alternative,"One of the bands that set the tone for the early 80's 2nd British invasion. This album (CD) features Simple Minds at their very best. PROMISED YOU A MIRACLE, NEW GOLD DREAM (81-82-83-84) and to a lesser extent GLITTERING PRIZE were very popular on the college radio front. SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IN SUMMERTIME rounds out a nice album of synth pop. The album is very well mixed. A definite must for any serious 80's collection."
5,The Glasgow sound at its zenith,"Timeless, like the early concerts, before Jim Kerr became a pop-star, always something held back. Timeless like the memories of this album drifting through Kelvingrove Park in the summer of '84. This is one of the great albums of the early eighties, one of the only albums which is as fresh now as it was then. If you, too, hanker for these great days when the kids of punk learned to play, this album is simply heaven."
2,The sum of the parts is much less than the whole,"This was an incredible disappointment after many years of searching for it. Whatever you may think of Beefheart and his often 4sshole behaviour, he did spur the Magic Band to heights they simply couldn't reach on their own. This CD is proof. Not that its necessarily bad, just not my cup of tea and very definitely not the Magic Band we love. Its mellow-to-the-point of dull country blues, Harry Manx is a comparison that springs to mind. If you want Magic Band chaos, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BD9NUE/qid=1146727684"">this </a> instead."
3,10' NTSC Accuscreen,"This screen is an excellent buy for the money. Un rolled, the screen is perfectly flat, and offers exceptional reflectance. Its only challenge is in rolling up the screen. My installation uses chains from the ceiling, so the case in which the screen retracts moves when the screen is retracted. That movement causes the pawls to catch impeding the roll up. It may take 5 to 8 tries to roll up the screen. If you have the patience, this screen is an excellent value."
3,land raiders,"sorry have not seen this dvd as of now, but with telly savalas, can't go wrong. looking forward to it"
3,Not bad for PS1,"For what it is, a PS1 game it's about as good as it gets on the ageing system. Player models are blocky but the game play is fluid and smooth.The batting / Pitching interface is incredible. Very pinpoit.Only gripe I had was pitching. It is really easy to strike batters out ( I mean ridiculously easy ) and starters can go 12 inning before they start to lose something off their pitches.Other than that, if you keep in mind this is a playstation one game, it should deliver the baseball fix you need if you're still using your original playstation with the LCD screen like I am."
3,"egos checked, exuberance only","The quintessential geezer album, Van `The Man' Morrison moonlights alongside Lonnie `Chewing Gum On the Bedpost' Donegan and brontosaurean trad-jazz trombonist Chris Barber on this revival set of retro-Limey chicken-picken folk songs. Recorded in Ireland last year, the proceedings are appropriately exuberant; Donegan's antiquated nasal bleating is a fitting adjunct to Morrison's squalling bluff and bluster on cranky old folk/blues tunes like Goodnight Irene, Outskirts Of Town, Frankie and Johnny, and Muleskinner Blues. While Morrison and Donegan honk and holler the simple traditionals like ropy old farmyard geese, the raw energy of the big ... six-piece backing band (Dr. John tickles the ivories on Good Morning Blues and Goin' Home) carries the load, injecting the right amount of steely twang and jangle to make these skiffly old dustballs chug down the track regardless of whose ego is bouncing by."
4,classic y&t,"Classic bay area metal, circa early 80's... Some of the songs are too simplstic for my taste, yet still deliver. The stand-outs are Dirty Girl, Rescue Me, and the last song (forgot the name) a ballad, and the song Knock you Out, a kick-butt, power-chord laden tune, though I wish it was longer. These guys are essential in your '80's metal collection."
2,Interesting only because the Kennedy drama is self sustaining,"I was pretty disappointed. I have read a lot on individual Kennedys, and was looking for something to tie them all together. This book is very surface level, and practically ignores the women in the family. I know it is more interesting to cover the successful politicians (all male at the time of first publishing in 1984) and the drug abusers (apparently also all male, but still not sure), but a word or two about some of the other Kennedys would have been nice. For example, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded the special olympics, gets only passing mention. All in all an interesting read, but mostly because the family (faults and successes) is so compelling, not because of the writing."
1,Hunting dvd... Not the show,I'm sure this is a lovely dvd but it wasnt what i was looking for. There is no other information that informs me what this dvd is actually is. This is the worste ad I have ever seen.
1,boring....and add more boring,"This book put me to sleep within the first few pages. After I woke up (and realized I fell asleep) I tried again. It lags, drags, and all that. Plus the religion got a bit preachy. It opens with two old women in a cemetary. Then lingers....there is no potential for this book....I'm glad it was free, I have to say. Paying attention to it still left me feeling like I wasted time."
2,Ivy Malone and God,"The plot isn't bad while not exactly gripping. The problem with the series is that there is too much Christian proselytizing. It interferes with the story and becomes overwhelming. I bought all the books, as I usually do with a mystery series, and I wish I could give them away to some sweet old lady at church. By the way, I am an old lady."
2,"Cute Lady, Dull Mystery","Ivy Malone is a grandma most of us could really dig. A hep old lady with spunk and sass, I thought I'd enjoy this read. Sadly, I did not. I waited (what seemed) a ridiculous amount of time for the real mystery to kick in. But, in the mean time, the author made sure I was thoroughly indoctrinated with Ivy's staunch Christian beliefs. Sloughing through the remainder of the book, I was saddened to find a watered down mystery that revolved around a sweet and fiery old lady. While I've always enjoyed a story with strong characterization, for me it was not enough to make me want to continue this series. However, the book is well-written, witty, and Ivy is often a hoot. While this may not have been my cup of tea, I encourage others to read for themselves - Ivy might be your particular favorite type of swingin' ol' lady."
2,"It had potential, but...","The book had potential but the main character, Ivy, had such a depressing view of herself and her life it seemed to cast a pall of gloom over the entire story. Combine that with the unrealistic and out of context religiosity and as much as I would have liked to care about Ivy Malone, I don't.This was my first and also my last Ivy Malone book."
5,Had to get them all!,"The first in the series is free, but I am enjoying it so much I had to buy the next 3. Read all 4 of them in a weekend! Intriguing, Amusing and very enjoyable."
4,lol's of the world unite,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As an almost ""lol"", here have been many times I too felt invisible and Ivy puts her's to good use. It was a real pleasure to read a book from an author who is not ashamed to be a Christian and inject it into her book in a easy, comfortable way. This book was a fun very pleasurable read."
3,Entertaining,Enjoyed story as I basically suspended any questions I had about how a little old lady (lol) could manage to get into some of the predicaments she did. Only found the constant religious references mildly annoying.
1,genre / mystery or christian,I have nothing against christian books but they should identify themselves as having a religous slant and not be sold as your regular mystery.
4,Ivy Malone is a winner,"I downloaded this book because it was free and I had just gotten my Kindle. I wasn't expecting too much, as many free books are not books at all, just snipets or promos...but I was pleasantly surprised. Invisible kept my attention and actually had me wondering what was going to happen next.It read with an ease and flow not found so much today. Not a lot of flowery descriptions, not many angles going nowhere--just a great ebb and flow which kept the pages turning very quickly.I am now a fan and follower of Ivy Malone and her adventures. I recommend this to anyone...Philip Norkauthor of Misguided Sensitivity"
4,Finished it in 1 day,"This story was really very good. I bought it because it was free and decided to read it after I got my Kindle Fire. I wasn't expecting the main character to be an older lady, but I didn't read anything about the book prior, so I didn't know what to expect.I will say that this is definitely a Christian novel. Which I loved. I say this because I try and read the reviews to see if it is truly Christian fiction. This is. I was very happy with it.I gave it 4 starts because there were some parts that were a little out there from a ""little old lady"" standpoint. Just a few things that weren't very realistic. Other than that I look forward to reading books 2,3 and 4."
4,You won't be disappointed,"Well written and entertaining. Some bits seem formulaic, like the Christian angle, and it's light reading, to be sure, but realistic characters and amusing scenes from an accomplished author. I'd definitely read another book by McCourtney. Far above average."
3,An old lady detective yarn,If you enjoy the Miss Marple series then you'll enjoy this very light mystery by Lorena McCourtney. There's little substance to the plot and the story more than a little old fashioned. I don't believe it can be compared with Agatha Christie as Christie always kept one guessing.
5,Good Book,"I really enjoyed this book, and hope to read more of the series, soon. I was fun and a good mystery."
3,Cute,Enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to my Mom and her church group. Fun mystery with lots of twists and none of the modern day trash needed.
2,Why gruesome violence?,"My wife and I were charmed at first with ""invisible"" and based on the excellent witty and compelling writing of Lorena McCourtney, I purchased all four books. I regret it. The second book had some graphic violence that made us uneasy but by the third book we were so repulsed, we had to drop the series. Did Lorena put that nauseating violence in there on her own--or did an editor advise her to make the murders more realistic? I don't know. But an alleged ""Christian"" writer should know better. I hope she made better decisions in her later writing."
1,Disappointing and predictable,"I downloaded this book after reading the reviews, which were, for the most part, full of praise for the author. After reading several chapters and still finding none of the humor or mystery that was described, I put this book in the archive of my Kindle. Rarely do I not finish a book, yet this story was so predictable, dull, and poorly written, I could read no more. I also have to agree there there was definite religious overtones that were not mentioned in the description. I have no problem with reading about religion when it moves the story, but the numerous, and dare I say ""gratuitous"", references to God turned me off. Maybe my sense of humor is skewed, but this book was not funny or engaging. Sadly disappointed."
5,Love this book and the author. Great book,"Invisible is a fun story. It has mystery,wonderful friendship, and a cute plot behind the cover. Lorena McCourtney does this book justice. We usually read the serious mysteries, the serious romances and this book is a wonderful escape to all the mysteries, special friendships, and a wonderful crazy Ivy Malone. I couldn't put it down. This is the first book in this series and I can't wait to read all of them. Great book."
2,Some religion is ok but she was over the top in spots....,"I knew from previous reviews of the religious angle before downloading the book. It was not bad at first as the references were just peppered in. But, then Ivy had her ""sermons"" in several places - that was too much. For me toward the end I found Ivy to be a judgmental person who I really did not like at all. About of the way through I put it down for a while as Ivy really was getting very annoying. And yes the book should be in the Christian section. She does not like dogs, she does not like genealogy, does not like quilting, etc... What does she like? Will not be getting any of the other books in the series."
3,Mixed/Confused Genres,"I wish that when I had purchased this book that it was more clearly stated that it was a Christian fiction novel. While I am spiritual, I am not a Christian and I don't like to read authors who feel the need to preach every other page. This could have been a wonderful light hearted mystery series for a wide audience, however it should be labeled more appropriately for it's target audience of Christian fiction readers."
3,Be (a)ware - Christian mystery!,"This was a well-written story; if you're a Christian reader and enjoy light mysteries, you'll love this one. I can only give it three stars, though, because the faith and prayer aspect was a bit much. For me, as a secular reader, the overly abundant Christian references were very distracting. Would have made a fine mystery without the god-references. If this is your cup of tea, I recommend the book. If you're not Christian, or don't want to be force-fed Christian ideology, stay away."
2,"Heavily Christian, light mystery","While the mystery was interesting, the frequent proselytizing was really jarring. The Christianity was loaded on and didn't seem to have much to do with the story. The secondary sub-plot could be figured out by the reader many chapters before the solution is laid out for Ivy. While it was a harmless book, I wouldn't bother downloading another one, even if it was free."
2,Granny: A Day in the Life,"This is most boring and uninteresting mystery I've ever read. It took way too long to get the facts on what was really to be the focus of the book..Solving a murder. Instead the author give us a run-around on Ivy's everyday life as a senior. In short, we have to sift through all the baking and running errands before we even get to the meat of the story. I also didn't appreciate how Ivy was overly judgmental, it was annoying. I also found it strange how the ""Christianity"" was inserted. I was random and didn't add to the story or tie in as an import lesson or emphasis on life. It was like a bad hair piece.The ending isn't very satisfying either, like you have to read on in another book to really solidify the answers. I hate this book and I forced myself to read to the very end. 2-stars because it is a mysteryEven though it's free...don't ""purchase"" it will be worth every cent you didn't pay."
3,"Light on the mystery, heavy on the religion","It takes a while for Lorena McCourtney's heroine, Ivy Malone, to get involved in the story's real mystery. Thus the opening is slow going. Ivy's character is enjoyable enough, but unlike many Christians her belief is NEVER in doubt. Ivy would have been a more complicated and interesting character if at some point she had questioned her faith. Also, the bad and good guys are all pretty obvious and I was hoping for some surprises at the end that didn't appear. Never-the-less, I couldn't help but follow Ivy's adventures and root for her success."
2,"Good mystery, but too much talk of God.","I enjoy reading all types of mystery novels. I rate them based on how easily I can put it down and if I can tell how it will end. This one was very engaging and thrilling to the end. My problem came with the amount of time spent talking about ""Jesus Christ our Savior"", God and going to church. Don't get me wrong, I believe, but I do not care to have God pushed at me while I am reading a book for pleasure. And that is what I felt the author was doing. I am glad this book was free for my Kindle or I would have wasted money on a lecture."
4,Good Read,Enjoyed this book about an older Christian lady getting involved with solving a murder mystery. It's funny & light at times.
3,Invisible,"Loved the mystery part of this book however I'm not interested in the spiritual side of the read...I liked Ivy Malone alot and the writing was so good I actually felt like I was in the book right there on the scene of the crime! not sure if I would get another one of these books , that's something I'd have to think about."
1,Please Spare Me,"I love all types of reading material, including Christian-centered novels. However, I don't enjoy being beat over the head with a character's faith repeatedly without cause. It was jarring, did not further the plot, and seemed like self-serving piety (as in, Christians are inherently better than other people because they honor God and their faith so much). As the writing itself was only mediocre, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book. P.S. In the interest of full disclosure, I couldn't finish this book. I try to be tolerant and open-minded, but I have limits."
4,good book,I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to getting the others in the series. She is funny and gets herself into a mess of trouble for an older lady.
4,Entertaining,"I would recommend this if your looking for a quick read. It was an enjoyable book, I'll try the next one in the series."
4,LOL isn't just laugh out loud,This is a fun read about a BLOL--busybody little old lady trying to solve a murder. This granny is great!
2,Unlikely to read it,Downloaded this to read while deciding if I am going to get a Kindle. Unfortunatley it's in TOPAZ format so quality of the text is very poor on both the PC & the Iphone. Unlikely to read it because of this. Certainly would have been annoyed at the quality if I'd had to pay.
2,"Irritatingly religious, but good mystery","I'd have enjoyed this book a lot more if I'd known upfront I was going to be preached at for a good paragraph every chapter. Actually, I'd have enjoyed not getting this book; I loathe being preached at.That said, her writing is lovely and the character is awesome. I just wish she could turn down the God message a bit."
2,Oh Man,The premiss of this story is good. It could have taken what could have been a great character to develope into other stories but dropped the ball too often for this reader. One of the most difficult books to finish I hae ever read.
3,good book,"This one was a little hard for me to get into, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. It was a good book. I will eventually read more in the series."
1,Not for me.,"Not for the young or young at heart.Elderly women would love this, but it wastoo slow for me. I jumped a couple of pages andfound that I hadn't missed anything when I finishedthe book. Glad I didn't pay for it!"
2,Too preachy!,"I'm glad that I didn't pay for this book. It is way too long and preachy. I like the mystery part of it, but that's all. I'm skimming through the preachy parts. If the rest of the series is this preachy I won't be purchasing anymore of the books."
1,"Boring, god-bothering rubbish",Barely managed to make it past the first chapter. Drowning in evangelical zeal. Main character could have been interesting but lacked an kind of voice or believability. Not worth the money (it was free).
4,Just a plain good mystery,"These books are nice and have good aspects to the characters. Ivy is a funny little old lady who gets involved in a murder, mainly bc she became bored."
3,Pedestrian Christian old lady detective novel,"The reads okay, but the plot blatantly obvious and the little old lady detective generally naive. Ivy Malone is no Miss Marple. Think of a female C.S. Lewis writing a knock-off of a modern Miss Marple story, but dumbed down to a young adult level and an average mental acuity of the lead character.I read the book because the writing was reasonable, but there was no surprise in it, and I couldn't relate to the characters. I don't think I'll ever read one of the sequels even if it were free too. If you're into Christian literature, you might like this story. If you're into engaging mystery stories, you won't."
2,Iffy,"Required for my class. Found it hard to read. Lots of words on each page, very few pictures, and intimidating. I'm not usually one to fear a text book..."
3,Printed version of the SDK,"I originally was looking for any book that would explain a little more about MSI technology in an easier fashion than the Microsoft MSI SDK help files. This book doesn't quite do it. It is nice to have the information printed out for browsing, and he does give a few examples of VB code that can be used to assist in gathering data for the MSI - but there isn't anything in this book that actually new, fresh, innovative or enlightening."
1,Sorry I wasted the money,"What more do I have to say, I learned more by working through the Microsoft Windows installer SDK than I did from this book.I wasted my time and money on it."
5,Children's Bible,This Bible was selected for a step-great-grandchild who has had very little exposure to Christian values. It is written in such a way that I am hoping he will be drawn in by it and want to read it often.
4,CONTROL PART 2,"This is shanice version of janet's control cd(they were friends at the time), it's umistakable. The uptempo songs are so funky and full of attitude. Shanice obviously has a great voice the ballads are too vapid & old for her..even though ""the way you love me"" is a great song with killer melodies"
4,bosch review,"The tools work great, but the batteries do not last. Although my husband is a devout DeWalt guy, he wanted to try Bosch because the batteries in the DeWalt products would stop taking a charge after about a year of constant use. Luckily our local Ace store was willing to swap out the batteries for the new ""blue"" ones. we hope they will last longer than the traditional batteries. All of my husband's corded Bosch tools have been very durable and none have needed repair, so we are happy overall with the product."
1,Rubish,"Very dissapointed as the picture indicates a tool kit of ,however I got a 24 volt drill not what I wanted. My first and now only ever purchase."
3,Another one of internet auctions...,"It is another one of the internet auctions book. While the info is very, very good about buying and selling, there is no information about starting your own internet site."
4,Harem Scarem's drummer sings lead!!,"I am a huge Harem Scarem fan and I've always loved how great their vocal harmonies have always been on their albums. When I found out that their awesome drummer was a major factor in getting that vocal power and that even after leaving the band he was still called in to help with vocals on later albums I knew I had to hear his solo album where he is the lead vocalist! Most fans will be aware that Darren sang lead on the Harem Scarem song ""Sentimental Boulevard"" from the Mood Swings album. This solo album is really fun and full of great rock tunes played in a similar style to Harem Scarem's brand of melodic rock. It is even produced by Harry Hess who is Harem Scarem's lead vocalist. This is definitely a great listen for die-hard fans of Harem Scarem like me!"
4,A good read about the real thing,"Anyone interested in British trains, whether a modeller or enthusiast of the real thing should read this book. It is full of good information and pictures to match.A whole series of similar books is available and each one is a welcome addition to the bookshelf of any serious fan of the British Railways scene."
2,Unformed and Unfilled,"This book spends more time trying to disprove another view than supporting his own views. This leaves those who are trying to determine which view is correct without any additional information. In addition the writer gives some detailed principles of the Hebrew Language, which the reader has no way to prove of disprove. I would like a book that gives a detailed view of the creation story with Scripture to prove the contention."
2,"Boring, simply boring","This could have been a nice album but it is obvious that the genius himself, Rodger Hogdson, is missing.The tracks are simply boring. Some of them starts well, but they never ""lift off"" like older Supertramp albums.The sound is very good though, and the title track is partly exciting."
5,Great!! Read it if you haven't read it yet!,"This is the best book I ever read, and also the first book that made me cry. I like the parts before Carla leave the school. I like the story when Bradley yells ""I hate you"" at Carla, it made the story sound real. I just can't stop thinking how Bradley change , and how sad if i'm Bradley when Carla is leaving the school."
3,good middle-reader book with a unique voice,"Bradley is a bad kid. He never does his homework, he doesn't play well with others. Then a new, young guidance councilor, Carla, sees the good in Bradley and helps him to make friends with the new student, Jeff. Sachar's child-like prose helps to capture the difficult world of childhood and being an outsider. A good middle grade read that doesn't quite move beyond average, though it does jerk a few tears. Grade: B-"
2,Brad's review,No I did not like this book. I did not like it because it was not my type of book my type of book is a sport book. A person that would like this book is people that like bulling books.Bradley started out as a bully and had bad grades and in the middle of school he just had bad grades because he stopped being a bully. At the end of the year he got his first 100% in math.I think the kind of person that would like this book is someone that likes Louis Scalar books and that most of the chapters are in a school
3,You are in the Middle Bradley Chalkers,"This book was in the middle. Some parts were very exciting; some parts were so boring I had to put the book down. If you have to read this for school, then read it. Otherwise, don't bother. I am in 4th grade. My fellow classmates didn't like it."
5,theres a boy in the grils bathroom,There's a Boy in the Girls Bathroom This book is about a boy named Bradley. He had a sister named Claudia. At the beginning of the story Bradley is a lot of trouble in school and pretends to be more tough than he is. He kept his desk a mess with waded up papers and other junk. He did not do his homework and in class he daydreamed and played with the stuff in his desk. I think he was in the fourth grade. One day a new boy came to their fourth grade class. His name was Jeff. I really like this book. I think this book would be good for teenagers. I hope that others who read this book like it. Rating five stars
2,FUZZY PICTURE,I USED TO LOVE THIS SERIES WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.SO I THOUGHT I'D ADD IT TO MY MOVIE LIBRARY. I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PICTURE QUALITY.IT'S LIKE THEY MERELY COPIED A FUZZY VHS ONTO A DVD WITHOUT RE-MASTERING IT.
4,My first Elizabeth George book,"FOR THE SAKE OF ELENA is my introduction to Elizabeth George and her detectives Lynley and Havers. I enjoyed the twists in the plot; as soon as I had made up my mind that a certain character was guilty, a new piece of evidence would be discovered to deflect suspicion. All of the suspects were introduced early enough for the reader to ponder the guilt or innocence of each. I look forward to more of George's work."
5,Inspector Lynley,"An excellent book, and also TV movie. It's great reading the Lynley series after having watched them on PBS. And I have the entire Lynley Series on DVD. One of the best mysteries series that everyone should read and watch!"
3,Sake of Elena,The book is good but George's later books have more depth to them. Not enough depth to the characters being scrutinized for the murder.
5,Hooray for Elizabeth,I wish all writers were capable of drawing their characters and weaving their plots as expertly as Ms George. Keep writing Elizabeth!!
3,Huh?,"George writes that the artist is at the island, in the fog, and steps on an arm, first chapter. It isn't a dream, it is written that way. George doesn't stick with this, and that is troublesome. Also, the canvas was returned to the artist, but then somehow, without explanation, found at Elena's fathers house by his ex-wife. Again, not consistant, and yet very vital details to the story and to solving the murder. I have never read such inconsistancies in EG's books. Left me frustrated."
3,Munsters classic TV,"Sitting down right now to watch. 5pm 3/19/2011. Starting out with Season 1 Episode 1. Audio goes out of sync everyonce in awhile but, as I remember that is what happened with those shows when I was a kid."
5,Well worth it!,"If you're a Munsters Fan, you will be happy with this set. It includes not only all the series episodes, but also the Pilot, some bonus footage on each disk, and 2 complete movies, ""Revenge of the Munsters"" and ""Munster Go Home""."
5,"Great, prompt delivery",I ordered these books for my son. The books arrived promptly and my son was thrilled!
2,Better Options Elsewhere,"The idea of this set is nice, but the toothbrush bristles are not quite soft enough for baby's teeth/gums and a little large for baby's mouth, and the gum stimulator (which is the main reason I got this set for my teething baby) is a bit too big for my baby's mouth too, and he gags on it pretty easily. The finger brush is good - the same as any other. However, none of the products are BPA-Free, and they're all made in China, which is always a red flag for me these days; especially for something that I'm putting in my baby's mouth. If you're looking for a good gum stimulator/massager, I suggest the other one we got which fits my baby's mouth much nicer, is BPA-Free and is offered with free shipping by Giggle: [...] (Called Gum Massager Brush (BPA-Free).) You're likely better off getting a baby toothbrush and/or finger brush at your local grocery store."
5,Letters to God,"I loved this! It was an amazing story; spiritual and informational one that I could watch with my grand kids and then discuss later with them. It brought tears to me and the song I just loved it and everytime I hear that song ""Letters to God"" I still cry. Thank you!"
5,A great story,This is the kind of story that you want to hear. It's the side of life you never hear about. We need more movies like this out there. Especially the theaters
5,Letters to God,Purchased this for our youth group. They were all very moved and the discussion that followed was very insightful. I believe it was very meaningful to our group.
5,A Journey of Hope,"Following this wonderful teacher along his own path of loss and recovery, one cannot help but be inspired. A father's moving story of his fears, pain, guilt and growth serve as a window into our own fears and our own possibilities for growth. The language of his story is as beautiful as it is heartrending to read. Fein is the consummate teacher as he tells not only his story but encourages each reader to reflect on his or her own story. His experience reminds us that each moment of each day is to be valued and honored so that is can be preserved. A must read for anyone for anyone seeking wisdom and hope in moments of loss and pain."
3,The best of the solo attempts,"Being a big fan of Herb and the TJB since the mid sixties, I have been waiting patiently for an album that brings back that great sound Herb had with the TJB. Unfortunately it has not arrived, yet. I have to admit that in my opinion this is the best of his solo album attempts. By far the best song on this album is 'The Stranger on the Shore'. That song alone makes the album worth buying."
5,My favorite UB40 album,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a great album that gets overlooked. I have ""Riddle Me"" and ""I'm Not Fooled"" on 12"" long play vinyl singles. Its great to have a digital music copy now. For roots reggae purists, UB40 did become too commercial as they went on, as did many bands of the era. This album still had some real reggae sound and hadn't totally crossed over yet. Its totally worth having in your classic reggae collection. There are a few songs that are more like African jazz, but overall, this is a reggae album."
1,This digital version is simply a blasphemy for this great classic.,"I've loved this book since it came out in late 80's. I am tired of collecting paper comic books, so buying Kindle version seemed attractive, but it turns out a digital nightmare. The images are so poorly compressed that it is hard to read hand-written monologues in the graphic. Artificial fonts on pop up screen are fine, but as for graphic, you can see digital noise from compression in any edges on characters. As for the additional material for this 2005 version, those noises are just horrible on pop up screen, and resolution is ludicrously low.Those digital graphics novels must be checked by publishers or artist, otherwise should not be allowed to sell on digital format."
4,Great Story... about Gordon,I'm not going to complain that that is really a story about Jim Gordan and his first experience as a cop in Gotham city. It's a well written story. I only with it were a bit longer. Overall it's a cool back story to Gordan and shows what a complete badass he is. And why he can hang with the best of them. The Bat included.
5,Beginning of Batman,Loved this book. It was cool to see not only the development of Batman; but the development of Gordon as well. Very fun read!
5,I can't say a bad thing about this book...,"This is my favorite Frank Miller book. I've read some of his work on Daredevil (basically what's included in Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller 1, 2, and 3) along with some of his other Batman stories (Dark Knight Returns, Dark Knight Strikes Back), and Batman: Year One outshines the rest. It's simple, it's gritty and I love it for that.Year One follows the first year of Commissioner Gordon (then Lieutenant Gordon) and Batman in Gotham City. Reading about Batman barely holding his own against some two-bit thugs is such a welcome change after reading so many other books where Batman is a figure more invincible than Superman. And reading about Gordon's struggle against a corrupt police department is equally compelling. The book's only [low priced], and it's easily worth it."
5,thanks,"It came in on time and it was in impeccable condition. As for the read, it was for my husband and he got it finished pretty quickly because he enjoyed it. Thank you and i hope this helps."
3,implausable but beautiful artwork,"While the artwork is beautiful, the story is ridiculous. Batman does the impossible and wins out over a swat team. He calls Bats to come his rescue. From Batman's superhuman abilities to the ineptitude of the police officers, this does not make sense. Batman is not Superman."
2,Severely Overrated,"Really was disappointed in this novel especially considering all the hype it gets. The story is very short and is mostly about Gordon's rise through the ranks than it is about Batman. In fact, there is very little about Batman in the novel to begin with so do not expect to get the details about Batman like you did with Batman Begins. Also, as someone has mentioned, the novel seems to go nowhere and just when you think it is about to begin its over. The other major flaw is the artwork which is probably the worst you will ever see from a professional. The only positive I saw in this novel was the move towards realism. Other than that, there really isn't anything of value in this book."
3,READ THIS BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO BUY,"I checked this book out after seeing that IGN had crowned it the best batman book of all time. I disagree completely. It wasnt bad by any means just didnt live up to the hype at all in my mind. Some things you should know: this book is short! It took me about 30 minutes to read and I highly doubt I will wish to read it again. Also, this book focuses on Jim Gordon more than Batman. This isnt a bad thing because I found Jim Gordon's story to be very compelling. Maybe the main reason I didnt like this book as much was because I had read Long Halloween before it. Long Halloween is easily the best batman graphic novel so I suggest you check that out. All in all this book was good and fun to read but it had no lasting impact on me. I will give it props for the burning building action sequence though because I found that scene both exhilarating and just plain awesome. The rest of the book was so-so."
4,Good but...,"Great origin story but the art layout can be confusing. I should have expected this after reading ""The Dark Knight Returns."""
5,the comic book equivalent of great art,"this, along with ""the dark knight returns"" and ""the killing joke"", is not only one of the best batman stories ever written, but is probably right up there with some of the greatest art and literature ever produced in terms of profundity and reflection on the human condition and the problem of evil. bruce wayne, a tormented and obsessed man, struggles to find a way to put 'sense' back into his life after an unimaginably traumatizing event in his childhood--the gunning down of his parents by a two-bit mugger, with young bruce as the only witness. this horrendous crime and the dark shadow of absurdity and senselessness it casts over his existence forces him to become an avenger of sorts, a vigilante who, while knowing his task to be impossible, has no basic choice but to become a one man war on crime, using his inheritance and his willpower to become batman. this is a beautiful, haunting read and no batman devotee will ever forget it."
4,I'm Satisfied...Almost,"It was with great delight that I purchased this CD. As a long-time John Hammond fanatic, I waited a long time for this release. Normally, by virtue of Hammonds singing and guitar/harp playing, I would give this release a 5-star review. That being said, The Source Point portion of this release is classic John Hammond. The all-around performance is brilliant. It's the I'm Satisfied portion that I have a little trouble with. While John's performance is fine to very good, Delaney Bramletts production seems a little cluttered. While Bramlett has been a fine producer for other artists (i.e.Eric Clapton), he seems to have taken a mis-step with Hammond. Hammond band recordings sound better in a more traditional setting, not the tambourine-shaking,R'n'B Gospel mode that Delaney favored in those days. Still, if you're a big John Hammond fan, you're going to like this CD. How about 4 and 1/2 Stars?"
4,Funny and cute ...... What more could you ask for ?!?,"Chrome is a sweet blend of musical talent and the guys are pretty hot! LOVE The songs! If you have never heard these guys you won't be disappointed. Grant and band are ""up and coming"" talent in the comedy music world already having several songs on the Dr. Demento show! This CD is a bonus in every underground collection. And did I mention they're hotties?"
5,No music library should be without this!,"I thought I couldn't love any album more than Lewis Taylor's first, but they keep getting better and better. I have multiple copies of it- just in case. His journeys in to r&b are uniquely his, and they live happily alongside my D'Angelo, my Marvin Gaye, Maxwell, you name it. ""Satisfied"" is the gem of this one, no doubt."
5,My Favorite Book,"I had this book ""Teddy in the House"" when I was a infant. I enjoyed chewing on the book. When the book got dirty, my mother stuck it in the washing machine and it got clean. However, this is still my favorite book by far. I am 40 years old and I never get tired of looking at its pictures with lots of color. My daughter enjoyed looking at the pictures and I kept ""reading"" the book to her. Today my daughter is in college and she told me that every night she takes one quick look at the book. I am expecting a baby boy in June and I hope he loves the book as much as I did!"
1,Hokey Pokey Elmo Hokey!,"Elmo does NOT sing the whole song. In fact all he does is put his left arm in and his right leg. When he ""shakes it all about"" it's all noise...... no shaking. He is not soft and cuddly either. I am very disappointed. Then again, my grandson loves ANYTHING loud!"
3,buzzing is very loud,"The buzzing noise that elmo makes is very, very loud. My son copies the noise instead of the words or actions. It drowns out the music almost entirely when elmo is spinning."
1,Hokey Pokey Elmo is certainly Hokey,I was very dissappointed in what I thought was going to be a really great toy. The tag on Elmo says that if you remove the tag under his foot (that couldn't be removed before you opened it) then he would play the entire hokey pokey song. Unfortunatly all of Elmo's song includes one arm and one leg then he is done. I probably expected too much but my version of the hokey pokey would have included both arms and legs and maybe some head and tail too. This toy was a waste of money.
1,Dull and heartless,"If you're interested in Sufism and its connection to the heart and mystical experience, you'll be offended at the title of this dull and heartless CD. Monotonous vocals with contrived lyrics are laid over boring instrumental tracks that seem to have been generated by some lifeless machine."
3,bolts were too short,"I had to buy longer bolts to make this right and the hex bolt was loose , should come all togeter and pre tightened"
4,Great item but edges are super sharp,I love this thing with one reservation. It works great for what it's intended purpose is.Only caveat is the short side edges are super sharp and must be filed down. The tool's finish I rate 1 star because it's ridiculously dangerous. So much that it could possibly come in handy as a weapon if left as is.
2,guys gone wild .pool party,not as good as the other guys gone wild films.not so many guys .thought it was a short filmfinished quick.lost some thing the others had.
3,Pretty decent Belgian industrial.,"On ""The New Drug"", Guy Van Mieghem (also known for his work in Insekt and Blok 57) and Gin Devo deliver twelve tracks of heavy EBM/industrial. If you like bands like Insekt, Blok 57, Dive, and the older works of A Split-Second, then you should get into Vomito Negro as well."
2,NOT for one-handed bottle opening,"Yes, this is magnetic so it can be available on the fridge, and yes, it has a magnet to catch caps once they're removed. However...the magnets that hold it on the fridge are NOT strong enough to hold the opener in place while you apply the torque to open a bottle. You will need to hold it with one hand while you hold the bottle with the other.This obviously isn't the end of the world, but I'm definitely disappointed. I have used a similar opener at a friend's house that has no trouble staying in place. I would recommend just spending $3.99 on something like thisMagnetic Bottle and Can Openerand calling it good."
1,My Experience with Pheromone Spray,"This spray cologne has a strong odor but dissipates after a short while but the effects are still suppose to be there. I have not noticed any changes with women, especially my wife, which is why I bought this item. If there is any change in her affection or attraction, I'll let you know."
1,Benedition moon.,I love the way Pia sings. But when I place the cd on my player their was nouthing or music on the cd. So I could not here the cd because the cd was broken.
4,Good little introduction to Christian spirituality,"A powerful little book on spiritual formation through devotional practices like Centering Prayer, the Sign of the Cross, the Ignatian Examen, Lectio Divina, the Jesus Prayer,Labyrinths and more. It was originally written for youth group use, but the exercises described can be used by believers of any age. One of the reasons that we struggle with our faith is that we do not spend enough time connected to the source of all faith. Jones recognizes that faith is not an intellectual exercise, but rather a relationship forged in existential encounter with God. For thousands of years the devoted have done just that using the methods outlined here."
4,Pretty good product.,"Its pretty good. Seems quite durable, is pretty detailed and a fun toy to have and to play with. My only complaint is that its not very poseable."
3,Good but some more careful editing could have saved headache,"Well organized, from-the-basics primer BUT I just gave myself a big headache trying to work through an apparent absurdity in the planetary motion chapter (night 10) only to find that the p47 comment that ""all the superior planets' synodic periods [save Mars] are somewhere between 11 months and one year"" is plain wrong - in fact the appendix shows this, the sentence should have read ""between 12 and 13 months"". It's difficult enough trying to conceptualize this without this kind of basic editorial slip-up. Hope there aren't too many more howlers."
4,My review of Garden of Lies,I enjoyed Garden of Lies. The story line held my interest and the characters were all believable. I was anxious to see how the lives of the characters played out. I would recommend this book especially if you like books by this author.
4,my review,"A woman is faced with a decision so crucial it will affect the rest of her life: she will exchange her baby for another one. She lives to pay the price of her decision.Everything in this book works very well together to make it a good book to read: the plot is interesting till the very end, the characters are very well presented and the writing is the author's best.I started reading Eileen Goudge's books recently and I really enjoyed this one. Till the very end, I could not predict the outcome.Good book, and very good and interesting reading."
2,disappointing,"The outside of the Buxton wallet is nice leather,like others I have owned. Inside (change pocket and flap covering area where pictures or credit cards are stored feels and looks like plastic. Disappointed in Buxton."
5,I bought this for my mother.,She has had this type of wallet for as long as I can remember. You can't find these just anywhere. Thanks for making Mom's Christmas merry.
4,Billfold,"This Buxton billfold has been a favorite for many years. As years have passed they have become more and more difficult to locate. Now, 2012, the only place I've found this style is Amazon.com. It arrived in a timely manner and was exactly the item desired."
5,BUXTON HEIRESS CONVERTIBLE BILLFOLD,"~I OWN THE BLK BUXTON BILLFOLD (WOULD LIKE TO BUY IT IN RED & BROWN) AND TO ME THIS IS THE PERFECT WALLET. I ONLY KEEP MY DEBIT & ONE MC IN IT. THIS WALLET IS DESIGN FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T USE A BUNCH OF CREDIT CARDS LIKE ME, SO I LOVE IT! IT DOES NOT OFFER THE SLOTS TO PLACE THE CREDIT CARDS IN IT, BUT IT HAS 5 SMALL PLASTIC SLEEVES FOR PICTURES (OR CARDS) AND ONE FOR TWO KEYS. IT OFFERS A POCKET FOR CHANGE AND THE BILL SECTION IS SEPARATED IN TWO SO I KEEP MY BILLS IN ONE AND MY STORE COUPONS IN THE OTHER SECTION. IT HELPS YOU KEEP EVERYTHING WELL ORGANIZED AND EASY TO REACH. I PLAN TO USE IT FOR YEARS TO COME."
1,Nostalgia doesn't taste good.,"I remember being 10 years old and having these bad boys in my pocket. I would walk down to the corner store and pick some up, it was a very proud memory of mine that has been crushed by the present day purchase of this box. These sticks are only good enough for sidewalk chalk. They may not cause cancer, but it sure feels like it because they taste like they're 20 years old."
1,Disgusting,Ordered these thinking they would be great based on the reviews. I just ate one and spat it out. It is barely sweet. It has barely any taste at all.
3,Not the same,"I was disappointed when I tried these. I was expecting a wintergreen flavor with a texture similar to the dipping sticks included in Fun-Dip, at least that's how I remember them tasting fifteen years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if the company that originally manufactured the original either went out of business or discontinued them as these were probably very controversial.This item tastes more chewy and chaulky and there's not much flavor other than sugar with a waxy coating. I can't help but compare these to antacids. They are also thinner and bent and look more like a hand-rolled cigarette than one that is mass-produced.I would like to add that even though I consumed candy cigarettes as a kid, I do not smoke as an adult. My parents and school always reminded me of the negative effects of smoking so I honestly never had an interest, but I do ironically enjoy candy cigarettes, but sadly these aren't what I remember."
4,Great stuff but be sure you're ready for the amount!,"I love these sugary twigs and bought this package on a whim. A quick reminder: 24 boxes is a lot! Be sure to have someone else in mind when you purchase this! Otherwise, I fully recommend getting this if you have a soft spot for candy sticks."
5,introduction to scottish soul music,"Tinseltown in the rain was the first ever Blue Nile song I heard, and it immediately caught my attention. I sought out their albums. While I would probably rate this album's successor (Hats) ahead of this one, this is still a classic from start to finish. Favourites are Stay (""stay and I will understand you"") and Easter Parade. Try to catch the instrumental version of Heatwave on the single - superb. Paul Buchanan continues to capture all those emotions we all experience - a lot of the time loss and pain - but expressed in such a way to capture you and make you feel that you're not alone. If there was some justice in the music world these guys would be huge, but I think the cult tag suits them. Buy this (and the other 2 albums). Pop it in the CD player on some wet, windy night and be swept away by the emotions this music evokes."
2,look great but don't work,I wanted something different than the usual wine glass tag. But there is a reason most tags hang at the bottom of the stem - you need to hold the stem to hold the wine! Some will hold the glass part but at least some of your guests will try to hold the stem and these make that pretty much impossible.
5,PERFECT!!!!!,"This is a great movie that tells about three inspiring women, Sarah, Georgia, and Euphemia. They are incredible and make this a touching movie that you will want to watch over and over! I loved this movie!"
4,True Woman,"True Women is a well written book and well acted DVD telling the story of the Women of Texas who had to protect their homes and children when their husbands had to join the Texas Rangers to fight off the mexican army of Santana who wanted to reclaim some of the Mexican teritory that the Texans had claimed for their state of Texas. These women mostly had to defend themselves,their homes and children and slaves against the Indians.The women had to learn to work together to accomplish this goal. It took great courage and determination to stand the test."
4,Sprawling look at the Old West from woman's POV,"As with many Hallmark mini-series, ""True Women"" covered a lot of ground -- maybe too much -- but was entertaining and informative, covering events in U.S. history from the female point-of-view for a change. Dana Delany excels playing strong characters and Sarah McClure is one of her best roles ever. All the parts were well-cast; even small parts, such as Irene Bedard's Toby, were played by wonderful actors. Michael Greyeyes, as Tarantula, was particularly memorable in a small role. I would have given ""True Women"" five stars if only the last hour hadn't hurdled over events at lightspeed. I still recommend it to anyone interested in revisiting history in an intelligent, visually exciting way."
1,Terrible quality,I bought this at a local store because the size was perfect and the price was right. It worked excellent two times. The third time I tried to use it the lights didn't come on and it wouldn't heat. I could not find the receipt to return it so I opened it to inspect it. One of the two 120V wires is connected serially with a component that I suspect is a fuse that blew. It's not a common type that could be picked up at a local hardware or electronics store though and I could not find anything that matched it online. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Not fit for the dumpster,"What a worthless piece of crap. It burnt my rice to the bottom of the bowl four times. On the fifth, a burning smell was emitted from the device, followed by the light going out. The device was broken from then on. I would not recommend this product even as a practical joke."
1,Absolutely disgusting.png,"Bought at $20. It's worth $2 for the spatula that it comes with.The ""Keep Warm"" functionality is completely useless as your rice will get hard and stale after being in the machine. You're better off putting left over rice in the fridge.The worst part is the inner bowl. I believe it's coated aluminum. It scrapes very easily, doesn't distribute heat well (bottom part will burn), not durable at all... I can go on forever.Just cough up $100 more and buy a Zojirushi."
3,"Rice cooker worked well, pot is sorta cheap.","I bought this because it was on sale at Kroger and I borrowed my friend's all the time. Now I wish I would have purchased another brand, whether it was the same on a smaller one or more on another of the same size.PROS:- Worked great for 4 months before I put it in storage for the summer.- Great size and prize for a college student like me.- Steamer basket made it easy to pull a healthy dinner together in the dorm room!- I even made great oatmeal in it!CONS:- The cheap aluminum pot is easily scratched and beat by plastic spoon included! Washing by hand with a sponge even did damage.- Subsequently, after a few meals it began to stick and is progressively getting worse.I would not recommend this brand or product, you can easily buy better! My parents have a smaller one that is cheaper from Wal-Mart (may be here, too) and it's non-stick coated and has gone several months now without scratching or sticking."
4,"Great Performance, but... Poor Installation Instructions","After spending several hours trying to decipher the cryptic instructions, I finally found the 'magic' words I needed on the last page in the last paragraph in the last sentence bracketed within paratheses. At that point I was not in a sane mood to rate this product as I was seriously contemplating using the converter for target practice. But after finally succeeding in getting this product installed, it has been great!! No problems whatsoever. Wonderful! And a very fast wireless connection I might add. So, if you purchase one of these converters, I would advise lining up a techno-geek just in case you run into problems during installation."
2,barely passable,"Asprin + Carroll + Rowling + never-too-old story of an introvert falling in real love with an introversive second half. The story is not exactly up to the task on any front. It's not funny enough, not outlandish enough, not teenage-accessible enough and definitely not tear-jerking enough.The only good thing the center of magical gravity is a door, not a carpet or a broom.It would had been even heavier crossbreeding of others' ideas."
4,Bleek comes of age,"If you love roc-a-fella, you'll love this album. Bleeks first album was average but this one is good. Almost every track on the album is off the hook. Memphis Bleek is definately becoming one of the elite rappers. If you like roc-a-fella, buy this album. You are about to witness a dynasty like no other."
1,Avoid at all costs,Everyone I've ran into that owns this CD said they are unhappy that they spent money on this piece of burnt wax. I even listened to the album myself and their claims were justified. I do not recommend this album to anyone and I suggest you stay away from it at all costs. Don't waste your money and don't be fooled by overbudgeted videos that intice you to this trash.
2,Understanding why memphis biatch is terrible.,"Diz album has to be a joke, right ? Memphis bleek's "" the understanding"" sounds like crap and the beats? Terrible. F*ck cocka-fella records. Why yall support diz kind of trash when there's much better music to listing to? Idiots."
3,"Yeah, no tablature","I was happy to have the written music, but like Brett, I don't read music very well and play much better from tab. Big disappointment. But nonetheless, you have the chords used, and you can piece it together well enough."
1,Investing In Small-Cap Stocks,Hated the book ! The book overstates the obvious and is written on a first grade level. If you know nothing about stocks than maybe this book is for you. The book was a waste of time and money for me.
2,"Why is this classic only available in an ""e""edition.","I am appalled that this fabulous novel is only available new in this barebones edition, no intro, no scholarly apparatus. What happened to the lovely Penguin edition????? What is happening to literature?The novel itself is a gem, the only (that I know) serious literary representation of the development of a theatre actress."
4,Pre-K Activities,This one is ahhhawesoomme!!! my 4 year old love this book he goes nuts with the stickers which is his favorite thing to do.
3,"Taggie Ball, not a hit","I bought this ball when my baby was about 6 months old. He loved tags so I thought he'd enjoy it. He has rarely played with it. He is now 15 months and we keep it in a bin with several other balls, he plays with all except this one. I know it is highly rated - an Oppenheim award winner, I think. It is nice, it is soft, it makes a jingly sound, it has many colorful tags, but for whatever reason my baby did not take to it."
2,Decent...sometimes.,"I've owned this printer for a while, and now I'm considering replacing it with a better printer, preferably multifunction. This printer created beautiful photo prints when it was new, but now it requires constant head cleanings and always prints with horizontal banding and never crisp text. If you're looking for a printer to print occasional photos and never require sharp text, get this printer. Otherwise, look elsewhere. I have a Sony 3.3MP camera, and I print those pictures directly from the memory stick using a dye-sublimation printer from Sony... absolutely stunning!"
1,poor quality,"I will never recommend this product.I bought one on Jan.21.2002. Up to now,I just print no more than 100 sheets,but I print something often. Recently, I found lines missing from the words, images.Tell the truth, I just can't believe it, only two month time, and the ink is just used about one third.I think I don't want to use any products of EPSON again in the future,especial this one."
2,Ink guzzler,"This printer really gobbles up ink. Since this is my first photo printer, I can't say how the ink mileage compares with other printers. The first thing you need to do when after installing the printer is to calibrate your printer to match the colors of pictures on your screen (Adobe PhotoDeluxe that came with my digital camera had a function to do this). Unfortunately after I printed only 10 4x6 pages, I have already used up 25% of my color ink which comes out to about $0.50 per pix just for the ink! If you plan to print out a lot of photos it may be more cost effective to go through Ofoto.com rather than purchasing this printer."
2,Ok ACRC book but not an exam guide. 1 1/2 stars,"I agree with earlier posts that the EXAM GUIDE portions point out the important facts, but this book DOES NOT measure up to the exam. By that I mean if you could memorize all the information in the book, you still could not pass the CCNP:ACRC exam. Not enough detail and some chapters were poorly written. You can tell very well that chapter were handed out to other writers like homework assignments at a high school."
3,A good book but...,"I just passed the ACRC exam yesterday! About Sybex, Todd's CCNA book was excellent. I studied that book and the exam notes and passed it, no problem. I thought his ACRC book would be of the same caliber, but I'm afraid it wasn't. It was a great effort though. But, if I didn't use the material from an ACRC course I took at a private institution, I would have failed the exam.He's really got to revamp his OSPF section. Some of the examples in the book, Q&A, and CD test questions had wrong answers. The ACRC exam covered a lot of OSPF and EIGRP. That's very frustrating when taking an exam this hard.I'm still a fan of Todd and Sybex, but I would buy the Ciscopress book too.People tell me that his CLSC book is the same too."
4,Pretty good for ACRC,"This book is pretty good for ACRC, but provides only a portion of what you need for BCSN, which is what I passed. In addition to this book, I had to supplement it with papers on routing protocols from Cisco's site.If you haven't purchased an advanced routing book yet, buy a book geared for BCSN. This one is good for ACRC, but ACRC retires July 31, 2000. This book will not adequately prepare for the newer exam. It does not go into near enough depth on BGP, OSPF, or EIGRP to pass BCSN.I believe Todd is working on a newer edition for BCSN, so look for it when it comes out. He knows his Cisco routing!"
2,$70 retail? For this? Please.,"This is not as bad as their CCNA book, which is the worst book I have ever seen in my life. However, it isn't as great as the authors and their friends are trying to tell you it is in the reviews. It would be OK at half the price and with the Cisco ACRC book as a reference with it."
2,Overpriced and not as good as Cisco,"Buy the Cisco ACRC and you won't be sorry. This book would be OK, but not at this price. It is way overpriced. Wait for a sale before reading this book. The Cisco books are always the safest bet!"
5,The book is good so far.,This book is easier to comprehend as opposed to the Cisco ACRC book. I like the Cisco book but the Sybex book explains concepts in easy to understand terms. An example- I read the section on VLSM in the Cisco book 3 times and did not understand what a VLSM was. I read the section in the Sybex book on VLSM 1 time and I understood it. Buy the Sybex book if you want to pass the test. Buy the Cisco book for reference. I did find one mistake in the book so far. I wrote the authors and told them about the mistake. One of them promptly wrote me back and acknowledged the mistake. He said the mistake would be published in the errata. All of the Sybex test series books have help me pass the tests.Phillip W. Diamanti MCP MCP+I MCSE CCNA
1,Not the best study guide.,"With 6+ years of Cisco experience in a large enterprise networkI thought I would pass with ease. DO NOT USE THIS BOOK AS AREFERENCE! It was full of ERRORS! It did not cover the material onthe test. I studied completely and thoroughly on the areas where I donot have experience, and was slapped in the face with the questions on the test. Believe me I did NOT skim the chapter review questions to try and pass. I DID STUDY this book. I assumed that the writers had some idea of what to put in their book to use to study.I was confident in the test questions that I had known from experience. I am still furious that this book did a terrible job of covering the fundamental quiz questions.I passed my CCNA test with a 95% using Todd Lammel's study guides."
2,Errors and fluff. Not a test prep,"Although it has some good info, it is a tad dry to read. Too much fluff for a study guide"
2,Marginally Useful; Keep Shopping,"After passing the CCNA exam using Lammle's excellent guide exclusively, I picked this up without hesitiation. Bad idea; Lammle apparently wrote this book without checking Cisco's list of exam objectives. Not only are major topics brushed aside (route redistribution, for one) but Lammle includes detailed information on topics Cisco doesn't expect you to know (ATM, SMDS, IGRP, BGP weighting...I could go on). The positive reviews below are correct in one respect: if you learn the entire book, you'll pass the test. However, you'll also invest hours upon hours learning superfluous facts that won't impress your friends. There aren't many alternatives out there, so if you insist on buying this, print out Cisco's objectives from CCO and separate the wheat from the chaff."
3,"A reader from Minneapolis, Minnesota",This book is OK except there are a lot of typos. I think whoever wrote this book should double check their work because it could lead to the wrong answer if they mistype the IP address or subnet mask in their examples. Same thing goes for the CCNA book.
5,Great book. Use with Sybex EXAM Notes book,"Stay away from exam cram. For Cisco they are the worst. You have to get the Sybex Study Guides and Exam Notes, both priced nice. Great books."
1,Nana's Review...,"Great Game! Great Fun! Brings back many happy memories with my boys, and now I play with my 9 year old grandson and my 4 year old grandaughter hoping to create some happy memories to look back on for all of us!"
3,New design,"I purchased this Classic Parcheesi Board Game for my parents, who are retired. They had enjoyed the original Parcheesi for almost 40 years, and their game board had worn out. I was disappointed to find that this is not the ""classic"" version of the game at all; rather, it has been redesigned. Instead of regular game pieces, there are 4 different kinds of animals (tiger, elephant, camel, and water buffalo). There is only one set of dice (the original game had 4 sets with 4 dice cups), and the game board looks very different. Since my parents are traditionalists, I ended up returning the game."
5,Parcheesi,"This to me has been the most exciting game I have played since I was a child. It's a great learning game, shows kids how to count and interact with the family."
3,Different design,"This is called ""Classic"" Parcheesi but looks nothing like the original game. Instead of ""men,"" the pieces are animals (camel, water buffalo, elephant, etc.) Instead of 4 sets of dice and 4 dice cups, there are only 2 dice. The board has also been completely redesigned. I bought this for my retired parents who had enjoyed playing the original Parcheesi for many years, but had to return it because they wanted the ""real"" Parcheesi. I suppose this version with the animal pieces might be more appealing to children, but to those of us who grew up with the original game, it is disappointing."
2,"Required, but unimaginative","This text may have been required by the course I took, but it is a low quality test written in the obscure, academic way that gives textbooks bad name. It takes an interesting subject and makes it boring."
5,Creating Literacy Instruction for All Students (7th Edition),This is a awesome text to have when preparing for the Rica Exam. It also helped me ace my graduate class.
1,Fun... untill it gets wet,"I recived this RC boat as a gift. I went through 2 battery cycles of use when the control unit of the boat shorted out. It was on my 3rd use where I found that the motors would engage as soon as the battery was pluged in (no matter the position of the on/off switch on the boat or the controler). I found that the cirut board was not properly sealed in its case. Even though the water that leaked into the boat was minimal, it was enough to short it. You can tell the quality of the work is very cheap in all aspests of the construction. The RC boat was fun untill it broke. If you still plan to buy this boat, make sure to re-silcone the control box during your 5 hour wait for the battery charge."
1,"RC 41"" Racing Boat","This boat is large, but is all it has going for it. It is cheaply made and leaked the first day we had it. It had so many problems that we took it to a local repair shop only to find out that there are no equivelent replacement parts avalible in the states, and that it would cost more than the price of the boat to get it repaired."
5,great box set,"I agree that this box wasn't complete, but i think its worth the price, especially if you don't already have the whole collection. The design was really cool. I really hate the so called ""new misfits"" I think they are an insult to the old misfits. To me they sound like green day, attempting to sound like the misfits. I really wish they would change their name, and who ever gave them the permission to use the misfits name and rep, should be knowned as a, ""sell out"". I saw the new misfits wrestling on tv, and i thought they belong there,(acting like the fools they are)because there even more fake than the wrestlers. So if anyone wants to hear real misfits than dont buy the sell out version of the ""new misfits"" They are the opposite of what the real misfits were all about. Raw sound that they liked and there fans liked. The "" new misfits"" are totally commercial and are all about the money. The real misfits will always rule! long live the misfits............"
5,Classic-Punkish-Perfect,"Whether you like the new Misfits or the old, this is a must have collection. Saved me money from buying all the other albums separately and came with a ""Misfits Fiend Club"" pin and a booklet with lyrics and mini biography. My only complaint is the wasted space having several of the same songs put on multiple times. The Box Set is just like having all the albums put onto 4 discs as advertised."
4,Misfits,"I think the Misfits rule and will always rule, and this is (almost) all their songs from the old times, and i love it, and i think everyone should have itI would have gave it a 5 if they had included all of the songsPs the misfits are still the Misfits even without Glenn"
4,Great box set,"This is a great box set from The Misfits , but I am a little peeved about the ommission of the Static Age version of ""Spinal Remains"" , which I prefer over the ""Legacy of Brutality"" version. And of course no ""In The Doorway"". I wish they included the original album covers with the box set instead of the logo too. But anyway , great box set."
5,Falco 3 USA/American Version,"USA / American Edition of FALCO 3 AlbumThe track title list is the same as the original german version (10 trk) some of them in different mix versions, including:Trk01 Rock Me Amadeus (The Solieri's Version) 8:00Trk06 Vienna Calling (Extended Version)7:00Really excellent"
4,I just love Falco.,"I am sorry but I cannot get enough of Falco. I will get every single recording that remains out there. Yeah, I am not discriminating. Since he is no longer here I want all I can get. Even the bad stuff. This is really great!!!!"
3,Okey Coming-of-Age Film,"I was disappointed by this film because I had been led to believe (from reviews) that it was ""hilarious"", ""enchanting"", etc. I am a fan of English movies, period pieces and such but this story did not enchant me. I had not read the book and perhaps that was a drawback--or not. At any rate, I found it somewhat confusing (although most of my questions were eventually answered) and ultimately I lost interest in all the quirkiness, unrequited love, and seediness. I do think that the cast did a professional job but with the exception of the actress playing Cassandra, I saw no real sparkle."
4,Thoroughly good period piece,"This literary adaptation is beautifully written, expertly acted and amazingly well cast. Every actor is exactly right for his/her role. Masterpiece Theatre should be this good. Okay, it's a chick pic, but one any intelligent boyfriend should sit through with pleasure and enjoy discussing afterwards. Get the popcorn.By the way, a fascinating experiment is to compare this movie with The Chateau (2001), which develops exactly the same premise in a totally different way."
3,Odd mixture of revisionist film-making...for those who read the book first,"For those who enjoyed the book first, this film seems strangely wrong.The filmmakers are too greatly influenced by a combination of theMerchant-Ivory films, all those wonderful Masterpiece Theatre/BBChistorical British dramas and a sort-of light, airy type of film-makingthat's completely out-of-place for this story.This family is living on very hard times and I don't think that's shownproperly. In the book, Topaz is a much stranger character (in the book,she reminds me of a blonde version of perhaps, Morticia Addams(!) andMortmain should not just be moody. In the book, he's much moreodd...and interesting.I guess they got Rose and Cassandra right, but there's none of thepoverty and hopelessness that's so clearly drawn in the book."
4,Creative Beauty,"I loved the clothes in this film and the way they could make it all seem like dress up. The style of the film was imaginative. The moat with the lily pads floating, I could almost feel the cold of the water. The castle even though it seemed like it could be cold it was warm in a cozy way with all the art of creative people living in it. I would love to stay in a castle like that where life could be created just like out of a story. Rites of passage held in the woods with a fire burning and wild dances. Flowing clothes and long hair flying out wildly. I want to go to Sherwood Forrest and see all the bluebells. The girl was romantic and wistful. Good Film- definately must go to the country in England after watching this film! Victorian Style want more of this in my life, its quite missing where I live. Creative Style with clothes, hair, etc. But all done without conformity and imaginative flair!!"
2,Biggest problem-It's rated R,"Acting, casting, all very minimal. Not a happy ending and I ended up throwing away the DVD. I wonder if the book is any better???"
3,"different than the book, but still okay","I was prepared to be very disappointed by this movie, as I've loved the book for years. But the film version actually made me think about the serious aspects of the plot - aspects that are under-emphasized in the book due to the narrator's dry British wit. The film focuses almost exclusively on the melodramatic, but it made me realize that the events of the book really are quite serious: the family is nearly starving, the father did serve in prison for pulling a knife on the mother, and Rose's fiance kisses her sister, who then falls in love with him. The film made me think about the deeper story of the Mortmain family, behind Cassandra's humorous narrative. If you've read the book and loved it, don't worry that the film will ruin it for you."
2,No Castle Captured,"This film is a great disappointment after Shakespeare in Love . There are some intellectual ideas that stem from the movie, but they go nowhere. Central notions of what constitutes love and poverty or money and position in life are not explored. There is a fine performance by Romola Garai, but however good her performance is the script fails her."
2,Boring compared to the book,"I dont have to go into what the movie is about. There are enough comments that explain the plot, etc. It was not faithful to the book that much. I HATED THE CHOICE OF ACTORS. The dad was a good actor, but as for the main charactor Cassandra? Hated her. I did not picture the actor as her. It was horrible and boring to watch IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK. I like the feel of the movie. It was smooth and well directed, but whoever chose the actors sucked. That is my main issue."
2,"Good coffee, bad machine","While this machine makes great coffee and espresso, the design is flawed. The milk container and milk circuit must be cleaned after being used. The milk container door blows open when it is making cappuccino causing the cycle to end, and the coffee grounds to be discarded and wasted. Now the latch on the door will not hold at all and must be taped shut. Wish we had bought a model with an external milk dispenser. We have never have been able to get the machine to ""initialize the filter"" without a failure that directs us to ""contact customer service."" All these problems were check by the service company while under warranty, but not resolved. There are no local service companies, so the machine must be packed up and shipped off for several weeks. In spite of all this, we love it and can't stand to be without it! We just never use it for cappuccinos."
5,Incredibly beautiful book!!!,"I am thrilled to have this wonderfully illustrated book in my Library. It is beyond description, if one tries to portray this history of Loetz Glass in words alone. I found suspected Loetz vases here that I, happily, own, and the authors left nothing to be desired in this publication....for the Loetz owner ~ it is a must have, indeed! Thank you, Amazon, for selling it at half the price of one offered on EBAY! UPS brought a jewell today! Now, hopefully, more Loetz will be on the way!"
5,best baseball game around,"I played MVP Baseball and it sucked, as did All Star Baseball but I bought this game and I loved it. It provides the best gameplay around. The only problems I have are minor problems. MVP Baseball lets you play as minor league teams which was cool but seeing how I could only win at manager mode at that game it isn't important that I can't play as the Bowie Baysox or Norfolk Tides. All Star baseball has an expansion team feature that was pretty cool but the game play was worse than MVP. I wish MLB had the minor league teams or allowed expansion/relocation so I could have the Washington Senators rather than the expos but it does provide an option to realign the divisions so you can create the divisions you want."
1,Please do not waste money on this book.,The most common sentence in this book is: Related HOWTOs can be found at http://MetaLab.unc/edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/... It like as well could have read: Almost everything in this book can be found at http://MetaLab.unc/edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/...
1,horrible,this is the biggest waste of money. couldn't even unroll the cork board without it breaking. ended up throwing it out.
2,Super Thin!,Stupid of me to not read the reviews. It is very thin. Not sure what you would use such thin cork mat for. I'll be heading to the hardware store to find something to back it with.
4,Useful for crafts but the cork is thin,"I bought this to make a bulletin board. Honestly, you may want to buy a cork roll that is a little bit thicker. If you're looking to cover something, this will look nice but it may be a tad too thin to stick pins through. If you use this, stick to thumbtacks instead.Pros: There's a lot of cork in the roll, more than I know what to do with. The cork looks pretty, and you can use it to make a bulletin board or cover something.Cons: The cork is thick enough to be stiff, but thin enough that if you put pins or pushpins in it, they would probably go right through the other end. If you were making a bulletin board, you would need to use two cork layers at least, or stick to just using thumbtacks. Also, since the cork is rolled, it doesn't stay flat, and I wasn't sure to how to make it straight.Overall, it's decent for crafting but you could probably find better cork for your craft project."
3,I enjoy a little rough sex,"This is a good, fun little single from LOA. Rough Sex is a great song from their first album ""Lust"", and the remixes are pretty good. This is probably one of their oldest cds so if you are an avid fan and collector then you should get this before they're out of print.(If not already)"
3,Lots of info,"This book has a variety of information. Some info seems to be for the emerging artist, other info is for the more established artist. It's a good reference but I'd suggest other business of art books first."
3,It's Okay,"This book doesn't exactly give the other Art Marketing books much competition but I think it's a little older so it may have been one of the first on the scene. It has a lot of fluff but it also has a few helpful tips that make it worth my time. To me, you can't have ""too many"" suggestions."
3,Tiring in the long run,"I remember U-Roy and actually used to listen to a lot of reggae, rocksteady, dub and the like and was quite excited to get this album. From a musical-historical and socialogical point of view this is a very interesting album After listening to a few tracks and the initial thrill wore off, however, I came to realize that it's not the kind of thing you would want to listen to for a prolonged period and a whole album of this is a bit much... While the underlying backing tracks are amazing, after a while I just wished I could listen to the tracks themselves without U-roy's constant riffing on top. For connoisseurs only... For the rest of us: just get the reggae albums..."
1,E-Mail Purchasing,"I received the Epson Photo Stylus 1280... Upon setting up the printer, it did not work at all (on/off switch had no effect). A call to Epson resulted in the tech's judging this particular item to be defective in manufacture; he promised immediatereplacement..."
4,faded prints,"I have had the Epson 1280 for about 6 months now. Very good prints except for it really uses the ink. The ink for my HP 960 lasted longer and had good images.A photo that I had printed after getting the new Epson of all the teachers at my daughters school faded horribly. It was hanging in a room with no direct sunlight on it. The only thing I could think caused this was the flourescent lights. It was printed with the Epson 1280, Epson inks, on Epson paper. I was very shocked and concerned."
2,i hated it!,I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY BROTHER AND WE TOOK IT TO A FIELD TO FLY AND WHENEVER IT LIFTED OFF IT CRASHED AFTER AFEW TIMES IT WOULDN'T FLY. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS FOR ANYONE.
3,"A little too ""woo-woo"" for me","This was a little too new-agey for my taste. Kind of entertaining in that light, however. Good if you are really pregnant and have limited range of motion. It's a very relaxed yoga workout."
5,Gentle yet firm prenatal yoga,"I have a few prenatal videos, and found this one to be a good addition. The gentle stretching has been great in my later pregnancy, with just enough strength building to help me get some needed exercise. I really like the specific suggestions for postures to do for helping the baby to be in the best position for delivery, such as postures for a baby who is still breech or occiput posterior."
2,Not exactly what I wanted.,"I have suffered with fibromyalgia since 1995 and have always worked hard to stay mobile. The yoga on this DVD is for people with very little mobility and is also heavily reliant on props. Yoga that relies on straps, blocks, etc, creates clutter and I will always talk myself out of messing with it. The health info had lots of good basic info but nothing new. I really enjoyed the meditations but don't want to keep switching out DVD's to get the perfect practice."
1,These bubbles BLOW,"I wondered how a bubble blower could work w/o batteries and well, it CAN'T. The only way to work this item appears to be to pump it 50,000 times until your armfalls off, and it still doesn't work. NOt for me anyway.This thing is a ripoff."
2,Waste of money,"After seeing dogs having a ball playing with the bacon scented bubbles on ""It's Me or the Dog"" on Animal Planet, I couldn't wait to buy this fun toy for my puppy. The bottom line is that the bubble blower part is way overpriced--you could most likely find one at Walmart for 1/3 the price, and my dog just sits in the grass, bored, and humors me while I play with the bubbles. Save your money. Buy a Babble Ball instead--that has kept him fascinated & running around the house chasing it for a solid month.PetQwerks Talking Babble Ball Toy for Dogs and Cats, Small (Colors May Vary)"
1,"Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins","Not really crazy about this book. It is not playful, and is too much like a research/fact book. Like going out and learning all the botanical names for flowers, rather than seeing the beauty of them"
2,Dearfoam slides are not what they use to be,I have worn Dearfoam slides for about 30 years. The last ones I ordered from Amazon.com are junk. They stretched out and started falling apart with just a few wearings and I only weigh 115 lbs so I am not hard on my shoes. The old ones I could wash and wear for at least a year. I will never order them again. Dearfoam has lost my business forever.
2,Fit strangely and label is irritating,"Wasted my money! I never wear them. Bought more comfortable slippers at Walmart for a lot less money. These slippers fit strangely, they're longer and narrower than any other slipper I've ever purchased, and the label irritates the bottom of my feet. Do not recommend, but everyone's feet are different, so you never know."
5,A truly underappreciated novel,"If you love Anthony, believe me you won't like this novel. However, if, like me, you find Anthony not even worth reading and IF you love the blues take a look at this novel. It doesn't have gratuitous sex in it. Any sex in it is truly loving and beautiful and it focuses on the heart of the blues.It is also true to its Texas location and the Texas characters are amazingly believable for someone who lived for a long time in that state.I'm sad that not as many people have read this novel as, I am convinced, would love it if it didn't have the Anthony name on it. That made people who like him pick it up (and hate the book) and people who don't like him (who might have loved the book) stay away in droves."
1,A waste of time,"The book *looked* interesting. Unfortunately the plot, what there was of it, dragged and the characters were uninteresting. Slim's whining got old after about a paragraph. I would suggest that reader take their time and money to other books that have something worthwhile to offer."
2,It's O.k. I at best,I have purchased Buxton wallets before and thought they were great. This one however wasn't up to their standards. Don't know what they are thinking. I was very disapointed in the quality and would have returned it but I'm simply to lazy. I keep wondering if it is a knockoff.
2,"Ok kit, most is cheaply made",This kit is fine for essentials but don't expect much more. Two of the bobbers didn't work and the eye's in the jigs either were completely sealed or weren't a complete hole. Just go to your local department store and pick up a set for the same price or less at equal to better quality.
3,busted,A good single from the Lords first album. Several remixes with extended or alternate lyrics. It's a fun song but after the first three or four tracks it starts to get old. A good cd to listen to and amuse your friends every once and a while.
2,Poor...,This book did nothing for me I couldn't look in MSDN Lib. for. Lacks proper explaination and covers few advanced API calls.
5,Inspiring and pulsating regae beat,"OK, these songs are mainly covers but they are really done well, with UB40's own special beat added to the reggae brew.Look how Neil Diamond's Red, Red wine is changed into a regae-disco song with Red Red, Wine.then there is the upbeat love song, Cherry Oh Baby, the redone Bob Marley song, Keep On Moving, the sad love song Please Don't Make Me Cry, that cover of the super Jimmy Cliff hit, Johnny Too Bad, with it's inspiring and pulsating regae beat, as well as the cover of another smashing Jimmy Cliff hit, Many Rivers to Cross, and the love song Guilty.This is actually my favourite UB40 album, from the heady reggae days of the early 80's."
4,Better than volume II,"This is the original and best Labour of Love. I like nearly every song on this album -- though ""Johnny Too Bad"" leaves something to be desired. UB40 takes their favorite reggae songs from other artists, and do them in style. (And yes, Neil Diamond's ""Red Red Wine"" WAS reggaefied by another artist before UB40 did it). A toe-tapping good time."
4,"Nice TV, a few faults...","Nice picture and decent viewing angles..2 video hookups with one S-video mounted so they won't interfere with a wall mount.Cons, like one reviewer said, the tuner is slow, slow, slow.The remote is cheap with tiny, poorly arranged buttons.The sound is hollow, like it's coming from the bottom of a can.The setup menu is non-intuitive.Leans back too far for my taste."
2,not bad,"I think the only UB40 tracks on this album are, I got you babe,Don't break my heart,Hip hop lyrical robot and my fav Mi spliff.I don't know why but these songs were then released on the LP Little baggariddim.This is still a good album if you like the mix of the two sounds"
3,"Let's not get too excited, boys and girls.",I purchased this (expensive) cd primarily based on the preceeding reviews and from seeing Savoy Brown at the Chicago Blues Festival. This is an average rock & roll/ blues cd at best. There is nothing remarkable about the cd- it has decent songs and guitar work but that's about it.
2,Does Not Work Too Well,"After reading all the previous positive reviews, it influenced me to purchase the Closys Oral Rinse. Unfortunately, the product does not live up its hype. In fact, I am disappointed that the product does not last very long, maybe 1 hour max of fresh breathe. (I did not even eat or drink anything after I rinsed with Closys). There were no detailed instructions on flossing, using a tongue scraper, or any additional preventive routine. I can't believe other reviewers rate the product so high??? Luckily, I found a much better product called ProFresh. The company gives a detailed preventive routine which only takes a few minutes to do. Even morning bad breath completely disappeared. However, there is a sight Clorox taste. To my amazement, I now have fresh breath all day."
4,"UH, excuse me...","...but where is ""I'm Comin' Back""? That tune is one of the tracks that proved Vesta wasn't merely a Chaka copycat.... In my mind, I can still hear that that little scattin thing she did toward the end...Somebody is being stingy with the Vesta and I'm not happy."
5,A Must Have,"Every Afra-American should have this book in their library. For an accurate picture of the contributions of the early humans of the continent of Africa, especially Kemet (Egypt), they need to read this book. Well written, the book can be a keystone to Afra-American, and Ancient World History studies."
4,Solid,Worked perfect for my project. Solid and ready to do work. I would buy again if I ever had to.
3,Expecting more,I thought this was OK.. I thought itwas mainly talk and not a lot of direction and in some ways too negative. I'm used to Dr Wayne Dyer and I'll stick with Dr. Dyer
4,Historical account of seaside community near Boston,"This is a very interesting book about the penisula of Squantum, located in Quincy, Mass. The book begins with the unique geology of the land formed in the ice age, then progresses to the the use of the penisula by native American Indian as sacred land, the arrival of the Pilgrims, 19th century resort destination, 20th century flight departure site for Amelia Erhart, and onward to the present."
3,Bad,"All right! Fly 30 seconds - 2 minutes, charge for 3 minutes....it canot change directions, always crash... pay so much money and buy a stupid to for crashing???????? and it has no speed control.... how to land???? just crash on the ground and it will land..."
3,"Louder and faster, but nothing special...","Earth A.D. is definately a departure from the Walk Among Us album. However, change is not always a bad thing, because Walk Among Us was nothing like Static Age, but it was still a classic. The Misfits were constantly changing their sound and Earth A.D. is a major change of pace from the classics ""Astrom Zombies"" and ""Last Caress."" This album is more of a speed metal album than a punk album and after listening to it it's easy to see how metal bands like Metallica and Slayer were influenced so much by the Misfits. Earth A.D. is missing the usual number of catchy punk songs that the Misfits were so good at doing, and is much more hardcore. There are some good songs on this CD, such as ""Death Comes Ripping"" and ""We Bite,"" but there are also some songs that are just painful to listen to. This CD is good to have if you're a dedicated Misfits fan, but it definately lacks that distinctive sound that made the Misfits punk rock legends."
3,JUST FOR HORROR FANS,"If you're a real horror fan and especially a one of Jess Franco - this movie is for you. It's rather rare and little-known, has decent special make up effects, pretty poor acting and Caroline Munro as one of the stars. If all this is what you collection is missing - this movie is for you. So the good thing about this flick - you can say to someone: ""You know, I've got Jess Franco's Faceless"". The bad thing you probably won't want to watch it for the second time. Sometimes it seems the director falls into too obsessive and unnecessary erotomania and the movie gets too exploitative. Acting is bad and characters sometimes look silly. But it may be parts of this film's charm. Go ahead if you like B or C horror of 80-s."
4,Not disappointed,"the system has great sound ... it's compact & looks great in any room without being an eye sore like some of the other systems. It has clean lines. It has some really neat features like the slide up window on the front, changing the colors, love the shuffel feature. Someone who is really into bass, sounds etc would love this because you can mess with all that stuff. :) Very worth the price."
2,"Lifestyle book, not etiquette","Make no mistake, this is a lifestyle book, not an etiquette book. Although extremely humorous and fun to read, it is 90% attitude and only 10% etiquette. How can you learn good manners from people who tell you ""grits is NOT a food"" -- indeed, good manners would suggest that you keep your food preferences to yourself. One should never make fun of other people's food, musical tastes, or clothing. Their self-congratulatory snot-princess style is grating. I'm at a loss for how mean-spirited, snobby spewings can be passed off as etiquette. If only ""Miss Manner's Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior"" was still in print! (Sigh)"
1,What a colossal waste of time,"This was a waste of my time and the authors'. It is not an etiquette book, but rather a ""how-to"" of preppery/snobbery. I think I actually read the same book, only much more witty and well-written, many years ago. This was The Preppie Handbook. Good manners has always been the ability to make those around you feel comfortable. In this book the opposite seems to be true. Also, as an aside, since when does what type of cocktail one drinks rate as an etiquette issue?"
3,There is a reason you need to be told these things.,"First and foremost, despite its claims otherwise, this book is not a true book on etiquette. Indeed, much common sense etiquette is actually contradicted in this book. Rather, it is a book on how on to act in high society. If you are not at least upper middle class, I would not bother with this book; you will become frustrated with many of the pricy and otherwise impractical suggestions it mentions.For what the book is(a book on how to act in high society), it is actually quite good. It goes into great detail in describing the quirks and foibles of the upper class. The fashion advice, the faux feminism, and general snobbery described in this book are all among the strange behavior that has perplexed me for years. Thankfully, after reading this book, I now have a better understanding of such behavior, and am better able to blend in when forced to interact with such people."
1,A Poorly Written attempt at the Etiquette Genre.,"As if their website wasn't obnoxious enough, the ""Etiquette Grrls"" have their own book. Others have already tackled the slightly-acidic etiquette genre and have done it much better (Judith Martin springs to mind). The point is, the genre didn't need an overly bombastic and egotistical attempt from two [people] with superiority complexes about their Princeton/prep school educations. Others have already commented on the irksome and apparently random capitalization found in their book. As far as their writing style goes, it just seems cramped and forced, as it reads like a badly-written joke that ran on too far. Worse, the book doesn't even focus on etiquette, it just reads like a 224-page whinefest about worst-case scenario rudeness, interspersed with unenlightening, frustratingly obvious ""rules"" for everyday behavior. If the EGs were hoping to enrich the etiquette literature selection that is available, they've utterly failed."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,I was very excited to get this book in the mail. I got ready for a good long read. Within 5 minutes I was disappointed. What are these girls talking about. This is not etiquette but rather two snobbish girls trying to make everyone else just like them. I am so disappointed in this book. The only debut it is making in my house is in the trash. Do NOT waste your money.
1,How to be a Snob,"These ""grrls"" are so incredibly wrong that I sincerely hope that they were trying to be funny. The point of etiquette is not: to make fun of people who have different tastes than you, to purposely embarrass others, to congratulate yourself on how ""wild"" you are because you wear *gasp* Doc Martens and Urban Decay nail polish, to spend your life pointing out flaws in others, or to flaunt your drinking habits to those who don't give a damn. The point of etiquette is to treat others how you would like to be treated. If you want to know how to be a first class pain-in-the-ass and a label snob, then this is the book for you. If you want to be well mannered and well liked, simply be yourself and buy the latest edition of Emily Post's Etiquette."
4,Once Around,Enjoyed it so much - it had a little bit of everything. Loved the ending. Heart warming story. I watched it 3 times already.
5,Great Gift!,"I bought this as a gift for my son's Hallowe'en birthday -- in keeping with a ""pumpkin present"" tradition. Both he and my daughter-in-law report that it is in fact excellent tea, and a most welcome addition to their tea collection."
1,Unreadable,"The OCR scanning is very poor. Many mistakes on every page render this book essentially unreadable. Publishers, maybe you could pay a few English majors 10 bucks an hour or so to type the book up....? I'd rather pay a few dollars more for something readable!!!"
2,"joyless, whiny and self pitying","Stronger than their second CD, but still not worth either the time or the money. If there is a good CD to be made of non-macho rock, it remains to be made."
4,Another great placebo album,"If you like any other placebo album you will feel right at home here. It is a bit heavier than later albums and does have a more alternative rock feel to it. It has great lyrics that make you think. Not all of the writing is perfect but it is a great first album by any standards. You can't pick a favorite song because there are so many great ones. The only tracks that I tend to skip by are ""Bionic"", ""Lady of the flowers"", and ""Swallow"". I can't say that they are bad songs but I haven't given them a fair try yet. Those songs are also the slower ones on the album. Some of the best on here are ""Teenage angst"", ""36 degrees"", ""Nancy boy"" , and ""Bruise pristine""."
5,An androgynous stick of dynamite,"Placebo's eponymous debut is an exceptional album. An album of great energy and power, it starts with the snare blast-off of 'Come Home' and it never lets up, through 'Teenage Angst,'Bionic' and '36 Degrees' to 'Nancy Boy' which is the best song on the album not to mention what should be an anthem of sexual confession and angst. Brian Molko's voice is truly a high-pitched, nasal wonder, much like the voice of Geddy Lee. Unfortunately, this album was followed by the less than spectacular ""Without You I'm Nothing"" which besides the standout singles on it, has a lot of gloomy, depressing, dragging songs. A great debut, and hopefully better things more in the vein of this album and ""20th Century Boy"" to come."
4,Cute Stablemates,"This set was the first set of breyers I ever got which makes this little set super spceial! I named them Rasian, Lemon,Chester and Blue. None of mine have broke yet. I hope your's don't. I do not reccamend this set for children under 3. Overall this set is very cute!"
3,The case I received was broken,I love this cd but the case I received was broken. There was no way to fix it. I wish I would have received an intact case.
4,Great ride but missing two key tracks!,"The Greatest Hits album by 5ive is a great introduction to the many people who were caught between the BSB and N*Sync and 98 Degrees fan line. However, I was a little disapointed to learn that ""Invincible"" was cut from the greatest hits! I love that song and I know that in Europe and throughout the UK it was played on radio stations and made it to the singles charts. The other song that I thought would be on there also came from Invincible was ""Don't Fight it Baby"" which I heard briefly in the US before it fell off the charts. Other than that this would be a great introduction to non-5ive fans and still worth the money for 5ive fans too!"
1,WORST ALBUM EVER,"THE MAJORITY OF THIS ALBUM SUCKSYOU CAN DIGITALLY REMASTER IT ALL YOU WANT, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE BAD MUSIC ANY BETTERHOWEVER, I DO LIKE: USSR, BIRTHDAY, AND GUITAR GENTLY WEEPSBUT NOT WORTH BUYING A DOUBLE ALBUM TO GET THESE SONGSSKIP THIS AND GO WITH THE #1 HITS"
2,The Next 35 Years Would Have Been Fine,"No, it's hardly ""why the next 35 years happened"", in fact music was being taken on a different and better track by the artists who released the breakthough albums of the previous year. George Martin wanted this release slimmed down to the better 14-15 songs, which was a good recommendation."
5,A Beatles Great,"The White album has got to be one of the best beatles albums ever! It is just so great, both sides have tracks anywhere from soft rock(Julia for example) to hard core head banging hits(helter skelter) if you like the beatles you'll love this album!"
2,very repetitive,Most of the songs on this album sound the same. they sound like wussy music. Birthday is very good however.
1,Fakes,"Just so everyone knows, any Beatles albums you see that are Japanese Mini LP's, are all fakes. They never made these CD's in this format. You've been warned."
2,There Have Been So Many Better Double LPs,"Having the potential to have been the strongest Beatle album to date with 12 great tracks, instead the group and George Martin put another 18 weaker songs and made this album difficult to get through. Songs like Goodnight (who cares if there is a lullaby on this?) Savoy Truffle and Long Long Long have little attraction.It is tough to produce a double album that carries its weight. Few have done it, but many are better than this. 5-stars for the 10 good songs plus 1 star for the 20 other songs = about 2 stars."
2,Somewhere in Here is an Album,"The Beatles released Sgt. Pepper in 1967, and Abbey Road and Let It Be were both recorded in 1969. In between, in 1968, this 30 SONG COMPILATION was released, and much of it appears to be cleaning out the vault.There are 13-14 songs that comprise a great album (led by Back in the USSR), but to get it you have to wade through the 16-17 songs that are mediocre. The so-called diversity of the musical styles here doesn't help. Anyone who disagrees is wearing Beatles-style rose colored glasses."
2,Where are the songs on CD2,"Well, I received my shipment of the Beatles Remastered White Album CD, and thoroughly enjoyed CD1. The songs had a lot of new life to them, and sound really great. HOWEVER, either my CD2 is defective, or I am simply missing something. After inserting the CD in my computer, the Documentary video starts up and runs fine. The Credits video runs fine. BUT I can never find any songs on the CD, even though they are listed on the label. I did a Windows Explorer check on CD2, and there are no audio files of any type showing up, even though the audio files for CD1 show up when I check that CD. What is going on? Anyone have any ideas, or do I just send the shipment back? By the way, this is the second shipment, since I sent the first one back for the same reason."
2,I Have To Believe That The Beatles Knew This Sucked,"It's ironic that this is called ""Beatles"" since it is more a bunch of solo performances with the other Beatles used as a back-up band. Remember when George Martin suggested strings for ""Yesterday"" and Paul said, ""As long as it's not that Montovani crap""? Well, the funny thing about it is, there is some Montovani crap on this record, but it is on a Lennon song. This had to have been a joke.It always cracks me up when people disparage the solo McCartney stuff and then give this record rave reviews. If you like novelty songs, buy this cd. Otherwise borrow it and record the five or six good songs. George Martin is said to have pushed for this to be a single album. He had it half right. There are enough good songs on this to make one side of an album. If you take the good songs from the Pepper album and the good songs from this album, you would have a four-star album.Buy ""Meet the Beatles"" instead of this cd; its much better."
3,Notoriety doesn't mean quality,"Both Sgt. Pepper and the White Album are cultural landmarks. Sgt. Pepper's music justifies it. The White Album is good, but they should've listened to George Martin and pared it to one 14-16 song record. There are 10 tracks you could shave off without a thought. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" is the song that got me into the Beatles. How could George write this and ""Something"" and not come close to that ever again?"
5,Beatles - The White Album,"Although my 2 favorite Beatle albums are ""Sgt. Peppers..."" and John Lennon ""Legend"", this one is a collector's item. CD new and good sounding. Thank you!"
5,Superb quality.,"I have been buying these remasters a couple at a time. I have all but 3 of the stereo albums so far. They all sound great, but I haven't felt the need to review one of them until this one. This is my second favorite of The Beatles' albums next to revolver, and I own it already in 4 different formats. I have the original stereo vinyl, the double cassette, the 1987 stereo CD, and an Ebbets rip of the mono vinyl. I have heard this album more times than I can possibly count and I practically have every sound on it memorized.I can say that I have never heard it sound as good as this. There are a few exceptions, such as Happiness is a Warm Gun, which sounds a bit muddy, but still better than the old cd.Every sound is crystal clear, the bass has better punch, the drums are crisp, and the whole thing just has much more ""warmth"" than the 1987 CD.I can recommend ALL of the new remasters, but I recommend this one most of all. One of the best albums of all time just got better!"
2,don't be fooled!!!!!!!!,"The only reason i am giving this two stars is because the music is so good. The Beatles albums were re-issued on CD in 1987, this was before much time was put into mastering. For 1987, the sound was very good, but for 1998, it's not. So for a while I've been waiting for new re-issues of beatles material. I thought the day had come when I saw the words [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] next to the white album. So I bought it and low and behold it sounds the same if not worse than the 1987 re-issue. In fact, I suggest buying that one istead. I also am pleading for Amazon to remove the [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] from the title. It isn't, don't be fooled. If I had read a review like this I wouldn't have bought it. I don't even know why they put remastered in the title, it doesn't say it anywhere on the album. So anyway, if you have the other white album, don't buy this one. And EMI/Capitol, please remaster this great music."
2,The Beatles White Album,"The accolades accorded this album in the fluff laden reviews by people who weren't even around when this was released in 1968 are laughable at best. The best advice given regarding the White Album was by George Martin, who wanted it reduced to the obvious 10-11 finished songs.Rest assured, there is a great 5-star album buried within this release. Conversely, there are two other 1-star albums in the remaining 20 tracks that overshadow it. Altogether it averages out to 2-stars. Don't portray Revolution 9, Long Long Long or Good Night as innovative and insightful music. It's not. That's not say you shouldn't buy it for the good songs, but it doesn't make it a 5-star album."
4,The Beatles (the White Album),"I was delighted the first time I heard this ablum. It has so much to offer in textures, timbres, rhythms, and content. It also has a unique presence to it. Indeed, it was recorded in the summer and it even sounds like it. Outstanding tracks? 1) Dear Prudence; 2) Happiness is a Warm Gun; 3) I'm So Tired; 4) Sexy Sadie; 5) Revoltion 1; 6) Cry Baby Cry. If you enjoy musical diversity, you'll like The Beatles. Thank you!"
2,Six stars for the music minus four stars for the remastering,"So much good was said of this new re-mastering of the Beatles' sound, that I enthusiastically bought this record... only to discover it was much noise for less than little. The sound is firmer, which is nice, but there is so much space between each instrument that you can proudly show of your loud speakers, but the coherence of the sound has disappeared. The texture is as metallic as techno music can be, but the charm of the Beatle's sound has completely disappeared. No humour, no warmth, no pleasure, no charm. In other words the final result is even worst than the previous CD version. It is as if the engineers wanted to prove the Beatles are a pale copy of Michael Jackson's music. If you still have the LPs, hang on to them."
5,remember,"I lost all my Beatle albums long ago in a move. I'd hear songs on the radio but never sought to replace my collection. Finally, after many years, I wanted to buy one CD so I could listen to it in the car. I looked through the list on Amazon and chose the White Album because I remembered that one was special. It brought back so many memories. Our generation was so young, innocent to the point of being silly, and rebellious. The world is so different now and it's good to remember."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!,What can be said that hasn't already been said about this album? IT'S AWESOME!!!!!
2,Great record...cheap packaging,"For a 30th Anniversary Limited Edition I expected a lot more. The ""newly remastered"" sound is nothing spectacular. Sounds way too ""sweet"" compared to the original LP sound.The packaging is just awful: the sleeve is white cardboard, not the glossy, coated stock of the original; the photos have the quality of a decades-old xeroxes, rather than the crispness of photographs, and the poster reproduction is so small and poorly printed, you coudn't read the lyrics even with a magnifying glass.If it wasn't so much trouble, I would probably ask EMI for my money back."
5,Brilliant,"While ""Revoluion # 9"" is an indulgent museum piece, and one I could do without, everything else on this album (okay, ""Wild Honey Pie"" I could do without, too) is brilliant. WAR AND PEACE is considered the greatest novel ever written...nontheless, I saw an Amazon.com reviewer give it only one star. Those giving this album only one star are doing the equivalent. I think it's the greatest album of all time."
2,Overrated,"Although there are bright spots, especially the opening track, the album never truly rebounds as strongly thereafter. Out of 30 songs, about 12 are really good, and should have been singled out to comprise one awesome album (USSR, Birthday, Yer Blues, Revolution...) 12 out of 30 = 40%, and that's 2 stars."
3,Mixed Package,"The Beatles White Album is a good album overall. However there are some very veak tracks in between some of the songs.This album should not have been a two disc set because about half of the songs on this album aren't good or really bad.The best tracks on this album: Back In The U.S.S.R, Dear Prudance, Ob La Di Ob La Da, While My Guitar Gentle Weeps, Martha My Dear, Piggies, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter."
3,For the Beatles this is an average album,"Here's the thing, the so-called ""White Album"" contains some very fine songs. What come to mind are: ""While my guitar . . ."" ""USSR"", & ""Revolution"" are at the top of the list. Other good songs include ""Birthday"" ""Don't Pass Me By"" ""Blackbird"" & ""Sexy Sadie."" The problem is the number of throwaways -- ""I'm So Tired"" & ""Rev #9"" for sure. Also questionable (I realize the hubris of questioning the Beatles here) are ""Ob-Li-Da"" (which Lennon hated) & ""Helter Skelter.""IF this was a single album -- 10-12 songs -- it'd have been as good as ""Let it Be"" (which also has some holes). As it is, this ranks near the lower 1/4 of the Beatles material (which would be better than most bands for sure).If you have the main classics then buy it -- but not for $31.00"
3,1 star for Repackaging and 5 stars for content = 3 stars,"This is a complete ripoff. The sound is same as regualar Capitol release (shame on you Capitol!!) The graphics are aweful, being a graphic artist I would be embarrased at this repackage. You can just buy the regular issue, there is no digital remastering done on this CD.In content: This album is a masterpiece! Every song is a gem (especially the Lennon tracks). It is hard to say what Beatles album is my personal favorite, but this one along with REVOLVER and ABBEY ROAD are the Beatles at their musical best!"
4,"4.3 Stars- A good album, but not top notch.","There are some very good songs on this album, such as, Back in the U.S.S.R., Dear Prudence, Ob-La-Di, Ob-la-da, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Birthday, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter, and Revolution 1. But some of the filler songs just don't cut it. For example, Why don't we do it in the road? has 10 words!!! You call that a song? But the good songs on this album make it great. Have you seen some of those kids reviews? They have to be joking!!! If not, I want to come to their houses and give them a sound spanking, like their parents would if they knew they were posting that crap on the internet!!! Peace, Love, Happiness."
4,Masterpiece of '60's pop/rock eclecticism,"This album oozes a terrific sense of playfulness with Lennon & McCartney at the height of their songwriting powers. They feel empowered to try just about anything -- both from a song structure perspective as well as stylistically. Marred only occasionally by a bit of laziness (three blues tunes?) and the periodic shock value experiment, the rest of the work exudes an ease and confidence that makes it a joy to listen to.Favorites include Ob-la-di (Has to be one of the most pure joyful songs and performances every written) and Blackbird (Lovely song and arrangement)."
5,"Greatest album of all time, regardless of genre.","Say what you will about ""Revolution #9,"" love it or hate it, this album has it all. From the astute balladry of ""Rocky Racoon"" to the energy-sucking, but always palatable sweetness of ""Mother Nature's Son,"" to the incredible songsmithing of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" every song has something for somebody. And they are all crafted to perfection. My first listen was on my parents' original vinyl copy; I now have the original CD release and the 30th Anniversay one. Worth every dime."
3,"Good Music, but poor packaging for an anniversary release","Like most other double LPs, the White album consists of a number of great songs, but a fair amount of filler. What could have been a great single LP became a bloated affair that should have been edited (example: Revolution #9 sounds like a semester project for a radio production class, and a bad project at that). I give the whole package 3 stars, equally weighted for the music and the substandard packaging for an anniversary release. Someone at the record company really missed the boat when it came to how to package this thing. No jewel box??? C'mon!!!"
5,Another masterpiece from the lads.,"This CD has it all. Folk, country, ROCK, and I mean R-O-C-K. Check out Helter Skelter! It sounds like a joyride to hell! :) Classic songs abound: Back in the U.S.S.R., Dear Prudence, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Blackbird, Revolution I, Helter Skelter. The Beatles did it all with ease. CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC!"
4,"""A Good Double Album...""","But, it would have been a GREAT single album if they would have gone that way. They didn't however, and that's fine too. The good songs on here are solid, and there's a lot of great stuff hidden amid the lesser ones.With The Beatles, however, as with any group you love, it is the listener that must and will find his or her favs.Mine are: U.S.S.R./Prudence/Onion/Ob-La-Di/Guitar Gently Weeps/Hapiness/Martha/I'm So Tired/Blackbird/Do It In The Road/I Will/Julia/Yer Blue's/Mother Nature's Son/Monkey/Sexy Sadie/Helter Skelter/Revolution 1/Cry Baby Cry.I won't list the ""No's"". It's not that they're all that bad...just not my fav's. ;)"
3,OVERRATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Does anyone agree? Granted the Beatles wrote some great songs but that's just where it all ends. They were not particularly great singers. They were seriuosly over-hyped just like thriller for this album(white album). This album is just pop/rock bunched up together and packaged for your consumption. Great musicianship is embodied by pink floyd in my opinion. Nonetheless this is still a descent album and worth buying.
5,Bound to its time,"This record exploits the strengths of the Beatles like no other record they released. It shows their progression in sophistication and music, stating once and for all that they are, without contest, the greatest band of all time. There has and never been and never will be another White Album. See for yourself to fully experience the world around you."
3,IT could've been much better...,This album has some fine music...but...its simply too long. And that takes away from the strong songs like REVOLUTION AND THE WONDERFUL DEAR PRUDENCE.It would've been better to condense this album down to a single album to showcase the cream of both discs. Why this wasn't done I'll never know. But as it stands I can only give it 3 stars.
3,"This first time use for Level-4,","This first time use for Level-4, I bought the US-600 filter with D-20 cartridge a year ago. It was taste good. This D40 without instruction for installation. The old washer was left in filter when I removed the old one, I am not sure whether I keep it or not. I assumed the side with washer in D-40 is place up to the top. The filed water did not taste good as D-20. It has chlorine taste. I wonder whether I installed it correctly or just the filler has problem."
3,Flow Rate too Slow,My rating is low because of the flow rate. I previously used a D20. It flowed faster but filters less particles. Water trickles with the D40 cartridge.
3,only bought cause school required,it's a helpful book but the information is repetitive to other materials i already had...
5,babyfaith videos are awesome,My daughter is a year old she's been watching baby faith videos since she was about 7mo.She is always getting in to everything and on the move but as soon as I pop in God made music or God made animals she is content.She watches them in amazement.thats how I get my house work done. I can hear her giggling and just plain cracking up.I highly recommend this.
5,What kind of????????????????,This is the type of Bible I use and decided I wanted a new one but the leather smells so bad I can't use it. I've had it for a while and it's still in the box and will stay there until I can find a solution to get rid of the smell.
1,Wouldn't recommend this to anyone,"I purchased this DVD because I heard from a friend that it was good. I liked the play the Maintenance Man, so I assumed this would be just as good...I was totally wrong. This was the longest and most boring play I have ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone---save your money."
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased this book based on my high interest for science and for different forms of religions, and also attracted by the title. After reading it I think that the mere yuxtaposition of some phrases it is not enough. I have the feeling that some opportunity for doing an interesting work has been lost."
4,Good book,"Has a nice theme of comparing eastern and western thoughts or one can also say comparing eastern philosophical thoughts with western scientific utterances. Liked reading it, would like to share this book or recommend this book to those select few who are curious about eastern philosophy but have not ventured into reading it yet, for the want of western scientific approval :)"
2,very poor,the bluetooth does not work properely. It is very noisy on the recieving end but ok when it is in my ear. I would NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. Investicate the product before you buy it. I am going to contact the manufacture (moterola) to see if I can get a replacement....
5,Brim Hat,Love this hat. It covers my babies whole head and neck. It keeps the sun out of her eyes and off her bald head.
4,Super Cute!,"I love the way this hat looks on my baby boy! He is 7 months and the 6-18 month size fits well with the drawstring in the back. He's never laying down when he wears it so I don't have to worry about it being uncomfortable. It covers his shoulders very well and I love that the ties are not velcro so they are not itchy or scratchy on his face. Only small drawback is that the hat can be a bit floppy. I wish there was some way to reinforce the brim to stay when you fold it upwards, however, it is still a nice product and I will probably buy one again whenver the next baby comes along."
5,stays put!,got this for my 9 month old and we love it. the uv protection and adjustable sizing are great. the brim is nice and wide too. just perfect.
4,"Good functional hat, but a little more insulated than I'd like for the summertime","The hat is nice and broad, the brim is floppy but not so much that it impedes her vision and big enough that the sun is kept well off her face and neck at any time of the day. My daughter's 14 months old and I ordered the larger size, which fits her well once the adjustable button in the back is cinched tight. The only thing I'm not pleased with about this hat is that there's terrycloth lining the part that goes on her head. It's only the beginning of May here, so it's fine for now - but I think that she may be overly warm in the summer months due to the insulation. But it's terrycloth, so I suppose it'll sop up her sweat! In all, a good purchase and we'll get a lot of wear out of this for at least two years if not three."
3,Floppy and unusable for a newborn,"I like the idea of this hat but the execution isn't right for a newborn, so don't let the 0 - 6 months thing fool you.It may work in a few months, but now it doesn't. It's way big for a younger baby - mine is 2 months and the hat is just oversized (and her head circumference is standard for her age). I like that it's adjustable, but the adjustable comes from a huge plastic toggle thing that sits right in the back of the head. When does a newborn ever have the back of her head NOT resting on something? Never. So it's virtually useless as a hat because I don't want her to rest her head back on that enormous plastic toggle.Maybe I'll like it better when she's older and sitting up, where I want the back of her neck shaded and she's got head control so the toggle isn't an issue."
2,Disappointing.......,"Not much to say other than this book was a big letdown after Demolition Angel and LA Requiem. I have just started reading Crais's books, and this one is nowhere near the quality of others."
3,The next Bruce Willis Movie,"Although the story did a great job of keeping my interest, I felt the writing and dialogue were taken from an action movie (or written for one); I did not feel like I was reading a book but a screen play. In fact, I would be surprised if this book is not optioned for film, with Bruce Willis playing the leading role of Talley. If you have a passion for provocative story and the written word, you may want to pass this one over. However, if you like traditional Hollywood movies such as ""Die Hard"" you'll love this book and it's characters."
5,A great hostage novel,"This is a wonderful novel of suspense. It is the best hostage novel i have read ever, apart from Jeffery Deaver's A Maiden's Grave, echoes of which can be heard in this work.This is a fast-paced book, with a great plot. Crais takes it a step-up from a nomral hostage thriller, adding extra dimensions to the plot and developing it into much more than just a seige thriller.Jeff Talley is a great character, and one which i would love to read more of. He is slightly flawed, but he is basically just a good man trying to do the right thing in a situation which he himself doesn't really want to be in.Right from the beginning until right to the end this is a great hostage thriller, with some great characters, and a great twist. You shouldn't miss it. It reads at break-neck pace, and is very satisfying."
4,Like Reading A Great Script,"Robert Crais ventures again from the familiar world of Elvis Cole and Joe Pike, and writes a page turning thriller that will soon be in a cineplex near you. Written with rapid fire dialogue and minimal character description, Crais gets right to the heart of the action with a recovering hostage negotiator attempting to put a rather harrowing failure behind him. But soon he's reluctantly drawn back into his old role and with much more at stake than ever before. Crais is quickly becoming a master at the thriller genre, and I found this to be even more nail biting and suspenseful than his previous novel ""Demolition Angel."" But it's definitely a plot driven piece, so don't go in expecting in depth character development. It's a fast fun read and will make a great movie, Bruce Willis having secured the rights before it was even published. Still I can't help but hope that his next book will be find him back to the Elvis Cole mysteries. They're still in my opinion his best work."
3,don't judge a book by its cover,"I was a bit miffed when this book arrived to discover that I had already read it. Got confused by the new cover featuring Bruce Willis.Having said that, I must have passed the first ""Hostage"" I bought on to someone else, because it wasn't on my shelves, and now it is!I remember it as being a fast-paced un-put-downable read, loads of tension to keep you whizzing through the pages to find out what happens next, and then slowing down as you realise there are just a few pages left and you don't want the read to end.I still prefer his Elvis Cole books, but Robert Crais is undoubtedly a terrific writer, all his books are worth buying (at least once!) and his later novels reveal a depth and power I never thought possible."
4,Hostage,"I would have given this novel a 5 star rating because I thought it was Crais at his best. The characters were believable as was the situation, and the suspense kept me reading long into the night.The 4 stars is because I thought the novel was leaning more toward a screen play. Don't get me wrong I think it will make good movie, and I still think Crais is a topnotch crime novelist. It is just that I feel Hostage fell a little short of L A Requim."
5,A novel of tremendous suspense,"I haven't read anything by this author in the past---but I will now. I couldn't put this novel down. In fact, I read it in about 24 hours and got nothing else done while I was reading. To me, it was a sitting on the edge of the seat, exciting, must read. I couldn't even go to bed at night without finishing it---staying up most of the night. What an exciting book! Hope to read another by Crais soon."
3,Crais Can Really Put the Words Together,Hostage is a so-so book from a great crime/thriller writer. This story is extremely well crafted so that each scene is exciting and believable. But Crais got away from his standards and produced a mediocre (for him) book. Many aspects of this plot are common to a huge number of ... TV shows and crummy movies. New hostage ideas are so difficult to come by that I don't understand why prize winning Robert Crais bothered slapping this novel together. Then we get the Mafia involved as the book becomes more and more unbelievable. Characters that are full and complex in the beginning are added to thin and boring ones later. Be sure you read all other Crais books before you bother with this one.
5,Relentlessly Intense,"Robert Crais peels off from his tried and true adventures with Elvis Cole to venture into new territory and he does it with his trademark intensity in Hostage. There are more twists in this book than a rattlesnake with a broken back and the bite of the thing is nearly as deadly. Very few books of late have kept this jaded mystery/horror fan up late at night turning pages. This one did it. Great stuff. Run, don't walk, to your nearest bookstore and get it."
2,Not your best Mr. Crais...,"Fans of Robert Crais will be disappointed in this one. I loved all of Robert's previous books. I consider his work a must read. The ""Hostage"" had too many useless words, I felt like I was riding a yo-yo with all the short character development of the subjects. Hope you do better next time Robert."
5,makes kids feel better about going to the doctor!,"Synopsis: Elmo goes to doctor for a checkup, sees a sick friend in the waiting area, meets Nurse Rhonda who handles a few things (blood pressure, eye chart, etc), then meets Dr. Diane who checks his heart, breathing, etc and gives him a shot to ""keep him healthy"". When my daughter was due for her 18-month well visit, I purchased this to prepare her, along with a doctor kit. We ""played doctor"" every day until the visit. Needless to say, it worked -- no issues at the doc's office (unlike her 12-month, which was torture), and she even willingly accepted a ""shot"". One great thing about this book is how it describes what the nurse and the doctor do separately. So when a friend's daughter was having issues going to the doctor (because having to deal with the nurse surprised her), I immediately made this purchased and gave her the book. And I *heard* that it worked! Another win for Elmo!"
4,Worth the read,My daughter is scared of the Dr's office so I purchased this book to hopefully calm her fears. She loves Elmo and the book managed to keep her attention almost the entire way through.
3,Could Have Been so Much More,"This is definitely a ""could have been"" DVD set. Given Heenan's fabulous and diverse career, there was plenty of material to draw upon to tell his story. However, the documentary portion of disc one is woefully short. Sure, there are some special features that are humorous, but there should have been more detail paid to the documentary of his career. Disc two, the matches, are not exactly the greatest selections. Many have already been part of other sets, particularly the WrestleMania related selections. Realistically, this DVD could have been up there with Jericho's DVD as one of the best of 2010, but falls well short of its true potential."
2,Bobby Heenan DVD,"Another WWE stinker!!!! No comments from the ""Brain"" himself, who was one of the funniest men in the history of wrestling. Barely any snippets of his comedy, just poorly done. I won't be wasting any more of my money on WWE dvds."
2,Not what I expected,"I was really looking forward to getting an interpretation to some of my dreams, mainly just for fun. Unfortunately, much of the book steers you towards what you should do in response to a dream rather than just interpreting where the dream may have come from.When I set out to interpret my first dream, I couldn't find most of the components of the dream, so I gave up. I.e. - the index of symbols is very limited.Also, the author avoids some of the more interesting dream contents, such as sex. Dreams about sex are described as your interest in ""combining forces"" with another person. I don't know about you, but when I dream about Cindy Crawford, it's not because I think she and I could start a business together.I still need a good dream interpretation book."
1,"Too much New Age, no science","I purchased this book based on a recommendation from Jeremy Taylor. As I find Jeremy's take on dreams and dreaming to be insightful and believable from a scientific perspective, I was eager to continue reading on the subject.Whereas Jeremy learned his tools and techniques through studying other authors on the subject, including Carl Jung, Freud, and Perls, Mrs. Bethards got hers from ""channeling."" The definitions of the dream terms are all based on basic New Age concepts such as chakras, reincarnation, and the ubiquitous - ""energy,"" which is never actually defined... ""Like attracts like: Tell that to a magnet!""There's no science here, only New Age goulash; and that's unfortunate."
5,"A ""Positive"" interpretation of your dreams.","Most dream books it seems are often very negative. This book, in my humble opinion, is truly positive and offers a great amount of insight into ones self, providing you are willing to look in. Ms. Bethards has taught me that all my dreams are about me and there are no scarry dreams only some messages from the other side need to be louder than others because we often refuse to look in the mirror and face life from the inside out. This book has truly been a tool for me."
3,Not what I was looking for,The book was ok. The ordering and delivery was fine. I just wasn't too impressed with the contents of the book. It was all very vague in info
5,Love this book,This is a great book to keep on your night stand as a ready reference to dream symbols. It is organized in alphabetical order to make symbol look up quick and easy. I've had my copy for years and purchased this one as a gift.
4,Good Read,"This book deals with more than Sufism per se. It is an distillation of ancient spiritual psychologies as applied to todays world and needs. Helminski draws deeply from the Gurdjieff 4th Way traditon, Zen and Sufism. But mostly the 4th Way - if you've read In Search of the Miraculous, Views from the Real World you'll see the parallels.The insights into the human condition and what needs to be done about it are excellent and is a very good primer into spiritual psychologies. They apply across religous boundries and would be of great use to anyone who is contemplating pursuing an spiritual path. Especially the western religious traditons were the concept of an spiritual psychology is all but lost or not understood.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it is an primer and not an how to book. Though any decent book on Vipassana style meditation will help here - which really forms the foundation for what Helminski is talking about in the book."
4,"Some good, some bad........................","I will admit, this item itself is a bit of a let down. With absoulutly nothing to take from it, it isn't exactly a product for advanced players to get simply to take ideas from it(Stats and such). For that purpose, it gets 2 Stars. But for new players, who might have played the PC StarCraft, this is an excellant Start. Cheap, easy to read, and simple. It gives a player what they need to get started. And if I remember right, I think Guass Rifles are listed in the Alternity Players Handbook. It has what a begining player needs, but I hope, that even though TSR has shut down Alternity, that they release a Campaign Book for StarCraft like they did for Diablo 2(For D&D). The Art does kinda suck though(Not all of it, but the majority). Overall, I liked it. I hope many StarCraft fans buy it, and I hope they learn the joys of RolePlaying from it."
1,DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think they found people off the street to act in this movie. It's just bad. It's not bad in a cheesy, funny kind of way, it's just bad. Don't waste any minute of your life watching this movie."
2,STUPID!!!! TO EXPENSIVE!!,"The pilot shaker is fricken stupid. It's just like any other mechanical pencil except when you need more led you shake it. If you are getting it or have it I recommend not shaking it hard. My six year old daughter is gentle and dainty and when she shook it, it got jammed."
4,Great Gift,"I was dissapointed when I saw the actual size of the box, for some reason I expected the box to be bigger. But overall, it is still great... and all the moives are awesome. My 3 year old son and 36 year old husband both are enjoying the movies."
4,Cheaper @ Best Buy by $60.00,"Just saw this set @ my local Best Buy for $140.00! Get it there or wait for the price to come down, no more than a year ago you could get this for under $100.00 on Amazon..."
5,Exceptional,"This book concerns the battles of 1884 against, first, a band of rival natives, and then against USA soldiers. While the history presented is probably slightly ""re-fantasized"" in the Macava tradition, the names, places, and events are probably correct to a high degree of confidence. Anyone who is interested in the history of the Yuma / Mojave / Mohave / Macava / river tribes, will probably wish to read this book. I recomend it highly!"
3,Exactly what you'd expect.,"I ordered these over a week ago after a long search for inexpensive Gore-Tex boots. They are comfortable, offer no pinch spots for my medium-volume feet, and performed well on a five-mile hike in 20 degree weather.I have two gripes - one, after such a short period, I've already noticed slight separation between the leather upper and the rubberized outer sole. Secondly, my sturdy-looking laces have already begun to fray and weaken in one spot.Both of these issues are minor, though, and easily repairable. I'm pleased with their waterproof qualities so far, and found nothing comparable in their price range."
1,oops,I bought the wrong ones for my child's alto sax and couldn't return them for credit. Totally upsetting. Too bad there wasn't a way to help folks when they accidentally make a mistake.
4,Good starter reeds,"I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing. The reeds are fairly consistent, and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds (teacher, student, school, parent...). The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed, as long as they are not pushed in too far. I usually move students to Rico Royal or Vandoran after their first full year or two."
5,Amazing dartboard,"This is an awesome dart board! I wouldn't get a diff. one, the cricket view is great you can see it from a good distance away.I am really enjoying this product!"
2,Lousy production quality,"Great songs, but too bad this album sounds like recorded in a metal trash can instead of a studio. Thats why I give it 2 stars."
1,F#&^%ing Fiction,"Simple: The film-makers state at the beginning of the movie that it is true.They lied.Then they continue to lie. . .And lie. . .And lie. . .I don't care that it was suspenseful, that the acting was good, that the camera work was professional. I do care that I was being lied to.Not thieves. . .Liars."
5,A Disturbing Document,... a disturbing document which shows ineptitude or mismanagement at a government level ... Wolverhampton Express & Star (England)
3,"Good, but old","Critical views of the aviation industry are very rare, so this counterblast to the peddlers of half-truths about safety is extremely welcome, very well written, and authoritative, coming as it does from a retired airline pilot. Instead of improving the safety of flying, airlines would prefer you to have therapy to overcome fear of flying. That's no way to run a railroad.HOWEVER, and this is a biggie, this book was first written in 1972 and contains NO NEW DATA. To describe this as a 2001 book is very bad practice. I bought this book because this is a field I want to stay up to date in, and I now feel deceived."
4,It still feels great!,"There are songs I liked that I may have heard at sometime or another but, this is a cd I was looking for because the song Another Lover wasn't just any song I've heard before. This song was one that made me remember the summer of '88 the great memories and how this upbeat dance song made me feel when I heard it on the radio. I was still a young kid at the time but even after twenty years I missed this song and wanted nothing more than to hear it once again. It was great when I finally got my hands on a copy of this disc and couldn't wait to play it. Now I can say Another Lover is still just as great or even better than before and, with tracks like Into You which is my new favorite song and, other rythmic beats like Do You Still Care and the title track The Book of Pride I'm amazed they didn't have more airplay hits. In closing, from what Giant Steps has to offer this is an impressive cd through and through and one that is definitely worth taking the time to hear for yourself."
3,Middling Album But...,"The Song ""Another Lover"" is on this which redeems the cd to a degree. IMHO, ""Another Lover"" is one catchy, infectious, and well crafted pop song. Definitely one of the best 80s mainstream pop tunes around. There is the more familiar radio edit of this tune floating around (and I actually prefer that most) but the album version here is decent enough.Other than that, nothing else on the album really stands apart except for the follow up single to ""Another Lover"", ""Into You"" which is also a winner. Since this cd is next to impossible to find, I would advise it on the merits of pop appeal to anyone with a penchant for 80s synth laced top 40. Again - ""Another Lover"" is well worth the find and ""Into You"" is respectable enough as far as pop goes."
1,"Product Life Too Short, Cost Too High","This coffee maker works a great when it works, but sometimes it jams and it's a big mess to un-jam it. And then a couple of days ago it quit entirely after using it only three years. $200 is a lot of money to spend on a coffee grinder only to have it die in three years."
2,Won't work well with oily beans,"After two or three years ownership, this product is a $200 disappointment. Two stars only because of the oily bean problem. Come on, now, for $200 you should get a near-perfect machine. I should have bought an $80 Capresso grinder.Pros:Looks nice; makes an even grind; low static cling; heavy duty motor; replacement parts available from Baratza; polite and responsive service department.Cons:Frequently has trouble with oily beans, the grinder spins but won't grab the beans. You have to shake the grinder to get it to continue grinding. This is after making the factory recommended adjustment to the slowest gear speed.Knob falls off. Baratza sent me a new one, but the new one is still not quite tight enough.The hard plastic ring inside somehow went bad. A $12 replacement part from Baratza."
4,Great cable for outside applications,"I bought this cable to use with an outdoor wifi hub also purchased through Amazon. It worked exactly as advertised, connecting the outdoor wifi hub to the router. It has worked great, even in the rain."
4,A solid comeback album.,"In 1987, the late Barry White signed with A&M Records and released this CD which was a welcome comeback for him. Steamy, sensuous and unabashedly romantic ballads like ""Love Is In Your Eyes"", ""Share"", ""For Your Love (I'll Do Most Anything)"", ""There's A Place Where Love Never Ends"" and ""The Right Night"" are vintage-flavored and (despite the subtle use of programmed drum machines, keyboards and synthesizers) make for a truly enjoyable listening experience. True, this album did not sell as well as 1991's ""Put Me In Your Mix"" or 1994's platinum-plus ""The Icon Is Love"" but I highly recommend it to all fans of romantic Soul."
1,80s hair metal pop crap,"Iggy should have trusted his instinct and not tried to make a 80s hair metal record. Instinct sounds like Poison meets Winger meets crap. Leave this stinker in the bargain bin and go out and find: RAW POWER, BEAT EM UP, FUN HOUSE and SKULL RING..."
2,unreadable,"After the first 20 pages of the book you will already have heard everything the author has to say, it's all about racism and sexism.It's good to see someone exposing on the fact that anti-sexist, anti-classist and anti-racist thinking is shaping the way many things are handled, some good points are made in this book but the truth is that once you have read 20 pages you have read the whole book, all it does is blame the same factors on everything and I found myself skimming thru the 3 later chapters trying to find something new to read about, but it just keeps on going on the same thing.This book may be novel and insightful, but the author lacks the writing skills to put it together into a coherent and readable essay on the subject.not worth buying, not by a long shot"
1,my worst purchase,"It only has one star, only because I have to fill in something, otherwise it would not have any. The DVD arrived with a spanish label, not the English one shown. When I contacted the seller he said it would show in English also. Then I discovered that it doesn't play on a normal DVD player. It only plays on an ""all region"" player, but since I've never heard of an ""all region"" player, I never suspected that it wouldn't play on mine. When I contacted the seller about this he basically said ""too bad, it was listed that way"" and he wouldn't take it back. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase - and am powerless to do anything but write a bad review."
3,Mighty Quinn.,What a classic! Watched 15 minutes years ago finally got to watch uninterrupted.Region 2 sux but it was worth it to me.
3,One of their better albums,"The album, 'Free as a bird' by Supertamp, from 1987 is quite a good mix of light-jazzy pop. I like it's airy, easy-listening feel.The keyboards keep it interesting and generally the songs deviate enough from the norm to remain interesting. The album is quite melodic and is very pleasant, and the lyrics are romantic. The title 'Free as a bird' refers to being out of a relationship. There is a good addition of backing vocals and they are really nice on the beautiful soft-disco 'I'm begging you', one of the highlights along with the dramatic album close, 'An awful thing to waste'.All in all 'Free as a bird' is a good album with good music and enough diversity to make it well worth the listen."
1,Not a gracious as it seems...,"This book RUINED the sorrowful, self-sacrificing story of The Martyr's Song. It centers around a main character that supposedly epotimizes ""God's perfect love"" through deception, lust, jealousy, obsession, violence, anger, and hate. And all the while he sits himself on a high horse, pointing his finger down at the church and christianity in general, accusing ""YOU HYPOCRITES!""All together, I thought this book was two-faced, and made for one of the worst attempts at a sequel I have ever come across."
5,Engaging!!,Another outstanding novel by Ted Dekker. Filled with everything from suspense to romance and faith and love. Emotionally engaging right from the start.
4,A powerful message!,"""When Heaven Weeps"" brought home in a powerful and inspirational way the cost of true discipleship and the ultimate sacrificial love of Jesus Christ and his atoning work for Christians at Calvary. This book deepened my understanding of the importance of our daily, hourly choices and how they affect our relationship with God through Jesus Christ. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in a serious, committed, life-changing and personal walk of faith in Christ."
3,Old Skool...,"I have an old episode of MTV's 120 Minutes on VHS (from back in the 80's when they actually played ""underground"", unknown bands). It featured videos by The Cure, The Swans, and Big Pig. All I remember is a guy with a shaved head in black leather and combat boots doing somersaults across my television. It rocked! I had forgotten about them until I found the tape in a moving box. I have never heard anything like it, and probably never will again! Worth a listen...."
3,Not Really The Misfits...,"Ok here's the deal with ""Legacy"". After Glenn Danzig broke up the Misfits in '83 and formed SAmhain he went back to the studio with a bunch Misfits singles, rarieties, and unreleased songs. He then proceed to rerecord himself playing all the instrumental parts and packaged it as ""Legacy of Brutality"". Jerry Only and the rest do not appear on this disc (which is why only a picture of Glenn is featured in the booklet. This is esentailly a Danzig solo albumn with ""Who Killed Marilyn"" the only song not avalibel elsewhere. Save your money and buy ""Static Age"" fpr the original( and better versions"" of these Punk Rock classics."
3,Not their best by any means,"This album almost turned me off to the old Misfits. This is for the Misfit freaks like me, who have to have all the songs. It has some redeeming qualitites though: Where Eagles Dare, She, and Who Killed Marylin?. If you didn't listen to the Misfits in the 70's, here's what you should do to jump start your collection: Get, in this order, American Psycho, then Collection I (aka Self-titled Album: The Misfits) and Collection II, Walk Among Us, Legacy of Brutality, and Static Age. Then, you should have every song the Misfits did, ever, with the possible exception of Spook City USA, and Dead Kings Rise."
5,Terrific Read,This installment of the Benni Haper series is the best in a long while. The author has found her stride again and Benni is in top form this time around. I loved revisiting the characters and could not put this one down. An awesome read for fans.
5,delectable mountains by earlene fowler,The benni harper series written by Earlene Fowler is definitely a favorite of mine. I love audiobooks and my Kindle. It surprises me that all of the books were not available via Kindle and/or audiobooks format. I was so pleased to find this audiobook to complete my collection. This series is at the top of my favorite list and this book was wonderful. It is so easy to get involved with this series. Earlene Fowler is a terrific author.
2,I couldn't finish it.,"Red-staters may accuse me of something - atheism, maybe - but I could not read this book. In places Fowler's writing is beautiful, but I couldn't sustain any interest in the characters or the plot. (I kept having to remind myself that the characters lived in California -- it seemed way more isolated than any part of California I've read about). There was just plain too much churchiness, too many quotes from psalms, too many religious conversations, topped off by kids putting on a play of Pilgrim's Progress. It made me feel claustrophobic and glad (a rare thing) to be part of the Big Bad City."
4,I GOT RESULTS (and I'm only 23),This book was amazing and I got results. I have two children with two support orders and an ex who had a habit of quitting jobs to avoid paying.Not anymore. This book game me the rules and tips on getting my two children what they were entitled to--without my staying in court and taking lots of time off work.
1,Bungfodder,"This is a silly book, written in a generic and patronizing style, which is devoid of substantive content. A waste of time and money."
1,Don't Click It!,Pray an alien sucks you into a vortex just so you don't have to watch this dense rendition of 'visitors'.
1,This sucks!,"Don't waste your time or money. The Ancient Aliens series was pretty interesting, this is just crap.I wish I could get my money, and more importantly, my time back!"
4,To walk the night...,"Samhains best cd, not as genious as the misfits, but there are definately some classic tracks on this album. Danzig tries to get more sophisticated and instead of just singing about zombies and vampire chicks samhain returns to the pegan origins of halloween, which probably went way over the heads of their punk following. Samhain have an atmosphere about them that has yet to be captured by any other band, but what else would you expect from the great Glenn Danzig."
3,More Dirty Steel Voodoo,"Product. Better than the last one. For Stones fans, there are three good reasons to have this. First, ""Lowdown"",with it's cat-scratching guitars and Mick's spitting vocals, could've been an outtake from the vastly underrated DIRTY WORK. Second, you need to hear a 50+ Mick, in the scorched white blues ""Might As Well Get Juiced"",sing ""I'm gonna give you such a piece of my mind, when I get around to it"".Take your time, Mick. And finally, no matter how many times the Stones put it on auto pilot, Charlie still plays every second like Gene Krupa is grading him."
3,let us compare!,"yes Deep Purple, another contemporary classic heavy rock band from the 70's still surprise everyone until today with their latest Album bananas 2003. But Jagger and Co - Stones?? they're only looking forward to the money, business and fame!!!! nowadays they rarely surprise everyone! Deep Purple still do their best by making anew album! because they are still attempting musically ""how one still makes a good sound in a album for 2003. Stones never think about it!"
3,Pretty good album,"I wish everybody would just stop bad mouthing the Stones because I don't think this album is that bad and I'm not goin to be a disloyal jerk and put it down just because they're getting a bit old. True its not as good as Exile(what could be?) But you don't have to act like they should commit suicide or something. I thought Anybody Seen My Baby was an excellent song. The rest of the songs were also pretty good, especially Keiths. I don't like Bridges quite as much as I like Voodoo Lounge but I don't despise it neither.I think its pretty cool that after all these years they still sound like their in their 20s and they can still get out on the road and tour and that Mick is still so energetic and can dance around like he did when he was younger. So I say, Long Live The Stones!"
1,Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkk!,"The Spice Girls are so bad! Their songs are stupid and meaningless. They are a completely manufactured band and they care more about performing than their singing. (which they consider ""good"") Their listeners are first graders and what they sing isn't what most people would call appropriate. I hope the Spice Girls are gone by the end of the century. (Better yet, before that)"
1,"Stupid Spice, Smelly Spice, Stinky Spice...","I detest the Spice Girls. Who'd want to call this stuff ""music?"" This album has stupid lyrics, bad singing, and the most awful dancing. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT buy this album."
5,IT WAS VERY SPICEY!! GIRL POWER@!!!,THE ALBUM HAS VERY SPICEY SONGS ON IT!!! I HAVE HAD THE ALBUM EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT!THE PEOPLE WHO HATE THE SPICE GIRLS MUST NOT KNOW TALENT WHEN THE SEE IT! I MEAN HELLO!ME AND MY VERY BESTFRIENDS MAKE MUSIC VIDEOS TO THEIR MUSIC ALL THE TIME!THE PEOPLE WHO SAY 'THEY SUCK'NEEDS TO GET A LIFE!BECAUSE GIRL POWER RULES!!!!!4 ETERNITY!!
1,Review from Anti-Spice,"The Spice Girls are awful! They can't sing, write songs, or even play instruments! They'll never make it in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as long as they live. (and after)"
5,CD is in great shape.,What can I say? I'm old school and LOVE Sporty!! Got this album to enjoy with my 10 year old daughter. It's been a hoot :)
1,Death Metal? WTF,"Spice Girls are NOT underground death metal, they're nothing but radio friendly pop garbage, and I'm glad they split. That Henry guy or whatever the hell his name is must be on drugs or something thinking that this is really death metal, but it's NOT. GET A LIFE LOSER! For REAL death metal, listen to Deicide, Nile, Death, Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Mortician, Morbid Angel, Cryptopsy, Children Of Bodom, In Flames, Suffocation, Obituary, Gorguts, Slayer, Sepultura, Brujeria, and Exhumed."
4,It is an Okay cd!,"I think they sound better with the ex spice ginger but now there new cd, featuring Goodbye is NOT that great and I hate to say that because they used to be one of my favorite bands! Ginger, I hate to say isn't that good as a solo singer either.=("
1,A terrible mix of junky songs by five girls who wannabe cool,"I think that Spice is a terrible CD. First of all, the Spice Girls can't sing. Second of all, the songs aren't very catchy, interesting, or GOOD! Don't waste your money on this filth."
5,BRILLIANT,"This has to be one of the most groundshaking releases of the year! These ladies have obviously been studying their instruments and practicing their singing from a very young age. Their bold and serious stage presence combined with their powerful command of the English language, make them a favorite at shows everywhere. This album takes an approach that moves away from all conventional forms of music. They have obviously spent years crafting these songs to perfection. They lyrics are especially noteworthy. The world's most acclaimed writers are in awe of their power and grace. The high sales of this album only needlessly emphasize how great it is. SPICE UP YOUR LIFE BABY!"
1,"I want, I really really want the spice girls to stop singing","This cd is a travesty to the modern music world. It seems in todays society people can sing stupid lyrics over horribly annoying backing music and still call themselves a band. Listing to my little cousin making noises with his armpit is more interesting than listing to the spice girls. Please do a service to all music fans and do not buy this cd. To conclude, I would like to say to the spice girls that there are many careers out there that you could be good at. Perhaps you could go into the fashion industry or some type of real estate. What ever your choice I'm sure you'll do well. Please just do not put out music because sometimes too much of something can be terrible. Thank you and good bye."
1,It Reeked.,"It was terrible. None could be worse. It's like, Hello,1985 called, they want your music back. I mean, what's up with this"
1,No talent in this band,"Spice Girls do not have any talent in them . They can't sing , they can't play any instruments and they're just horrible . Don't listen to the Spice Girls and Hanson , listen to Nirvana !"
1,THROW PIES AT THE SPICE GIRLS!,"I hate the Spice Girls, plain and simple. They are just a T&A version of Menudo, New Edition and New Kids on the Block. They are just a put together package to prove that females can be thrown together harmoniously. Not this pack. These women couldn't carry a tune in a pick up truck and their overly simplistic songs are dismally disappointing. BOO! HISS!"
2,Most of This Album is Annoying,"The songs ""Wannabe"" and ""If You Can't Dance"" are the most annoying songs on this album. I think this is the Spice Girls' worst album because they try to hard to be sexy on most of the songs and it comes out being fake and awful. I only liked ""Two Become One."""
2,UGH!,"I thought ""2 Become 1"" anfd ""Wannabe"" was pretty good,but the rest was a complete BORE.The other somgs had no special something,that make people want to listen. DON'T BUY THIS CD!! It's a waste of money.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
1,If only Amazon had their facts straight,"Well, it looked great, except that it did not fit in my civic, despite amazon's system said otherwise.Could not install, looks nice and shiny tho."
1,contents,There is significant repeat of the same matter.There is too much time wasted in showing the personilities of Mayo clinicLess material on back problem and more general nutrition and genral material is given importanceThe contents does not look like from Mayo clinic --should have been better selection of contentsAlong with back exercise some other yoga activities should have been shown like yoga for other parts of body more important than genral discussionShalbhadra Bafna MD
5,Phonics They Use,"It is a very reliable book that has many strategies to use for the kids that are learning to read, such as to make word walls, sentence strips, games, etc. This book will come in handy to many teachers."
4,Book revue,"I've discovered an author that is new to me. James Doss' work is great. If you like Hillerman, Jance, or the Thurlos, you'll love his work. This book is a prime example."
2,"Wonderful coffee, BUT","I have bought TWO of the 12 cup versions and I have never had better coffee. But,the cheesy aluminum handle has broken off of both pots, and not through abuse, just through normal use, and it is NOT the plastic handle which can be replaced that breaks, it is the aluminum mounting bracket for the handle, and short of finding a tiny little elf that can weld aluminum, there is no fix for the fracture. The coffee is so good that I am tempted to buy a third anyway, but I am going to shop around a bit and see if any other manufacturers offer more sturdy construction. I believe the breakage is caused by a built in design flaw that attaches the handle too high on the pot and in only one point of contact so that the connection point can also be used for attaching the lid. This saves a little bit of materials and complication in the manufacturing process, but it is a real bummer when the handles keep falling off."
5,Fantastic Coffee Maker!!,"Makes better espresso then most of the espresso shops here in Java Town, Seattle. It also costs about ten times less then an espresso machine that probably won't make as good coffee, and eventualy will need repair. Bialetti has been making these things since the dawn of time and have it down to a science.A few tips:1. Grind coffee between medium and fine.2. Don't pack coffee into basket like you do in an espresso machine.3. Heat between medium and high heat.4. Be careful not to have the handle be over the burner of flame.5. NEVER WASH THE POT WITH DETERGENT. JUST RINSE AND DRY. The more you use the pot,the better the coffee becomes.6. Before using for the first time season the pot. Make a pot of weak coffee and discard it."
5,nice coffee maker,"It's well worth the price, this is one that you can pass down to the grand children. I can't wait to make my first brew with it"
3,"Interesting at first, disappointing latter half","I enjoyed reading the first half of the book, relating to the author' childhood & youth in Chennai. However, I found the last few chapters to be insipid & bland compared to the previous half."
2,"Get real, guys! This album is pretty lame.","Ben Folds Five is a super group with so much talent. So why put out an album like this that's basically just repackaged material from other albums? And the song ""Satan is my Master"" is such a pathetic attempt at shock value. Your first two (real) albums were great. Get refocused, guys!"
3,It's great music but has no heart!,"when you think of BFF think naked baby photo's but if you want heart, find someplace else."
3,Finally reissued--but lacking bonus tracks!,"I was anticipating this release, hoping it would have the 12"" single versions of the hits ""Cry for Love"" and ""Real Wild Child"" as bonus tracks. No such luck. BUMMER. Missed opportunity to preserve 2 more 12"" remixes on CD...HOWEVER, get the very limited edition Iggy Pop Complete A&M Recordings boxed set and the first CD is the entire Blah Blah Blah CD WITH the bonus tracks, including the 12"" versions of Cry for Love, Real Wild Child, plus two 12"" versions I didn't know existed: the awesome Fire Girl and Baby it Can't Fall."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Nothing wrong with this book,and a lot right with it, but it is advertised here following title as ""an Abe Lieberman book"". It is not. I bought it expecting another in the Lieberman series. I was disappointed. Wish I could figure how to contact Amazon about this. Still,it was a decent book (more than my 1-star rating),so I didn't kick up a fuss. But don't be confused."
3,Fonesca is no Rostnikov,"After hugely enjoying all of the P. P. Rostnikov novels, this was a great disappointment. I could never muster much interest or empathy toward any of the characters, most of whom seemed to be pasteboard cut-outs. The book never elicited the can't-put-it-down absorbtion of Kaminsky's Russian tales or most of the books of Michael Connelly, Archer Mayor, Peter Robinson, Colin Dexter, or John Harvey.One of the main strengths of the Rostnikov stories was their exotic and convincing Russian setting. Florida culture and the marginal characters in this book were all too familiar to add interest to the tale."
3,By It's Cover,"I'm sure this is perfectly adequate pop industrial noise... but didn't this guy have any friends around to insist that they pick a decent image for the cover? This guy looks like he was interrupted playing Magic: The Gathering, and decided to pose in a way to show off his ""totally bitching"" mane.Gah."
5,The Action Keeps Coming,"A Hunting We Will Go by Hal Friedman reminds me of a great action advenure movie. The chapters are like scenes,short and without extra words. The plot is weird in a good way. A serial killer controlled by a woman so that she can get revenge on people who she believes have harmed her. Friedman writes in short chapters so you can stop and go whenever you get a few minutes. These also help the pacing of the book. The ending is totally unexpected and makes you wonder what kind of imagination it takes to dream up these things. Definately read it."
5,Best Book of All Time,And I mean it literally. This book is so cosmic that Silver Surfer would think it large. Anyone in the universe should get this book. It answers all questions about metaphysics and philosophy.Rage on Kenneth!!
5,Totally worked in my container garden,"I am a container gardener. My apartment patio has north facing light. This is my second year container gardening. Last year most of my tomatoes did not produce at all. This year I was desperate to enjoy ""the fruits of my labor."" About a month ago, I stumbled across this Green Light Organic Tomato Bloom Spray at my local Fred Meyer. I was really sceptical at first but I was desperate so decided to buy it and return it if it didn't work. I applied the product as instructed on the bottle and by the next morning my tomato blossoms had fruited! I waited a couple weeks and sprayed the new blossoms and the next morning, once again, the blossoms that I had sprayed the night before had fruited. I now have over 40 Roma's growing in one pot where as at this time last year I had tons of blossoms but none of my romas ever produced a single fruit. This product works."
5,EXCELENT!!!!!,"THIS CD IS AWESOME, ITS HEAVY AND HAS FAST LYRICS THAT ONLY PEOPLE THAT LIKE HEAVY MUSIC CAN UNDERSTAND. IF YOU LIKE SOUL ASYLUM GET THIS ALBUM(ONLY IF YOU LIKE THE HEAVIER SIDE OF SOUL ASYLUM)"
1,Excruciatingly Dull,"This book is like a motor that never quite starts. In the end, it's just a pretentious self-indulgence by an author who seems more interested in an unwelcome literary experiment that is lost on everyone but him. I can't imagine reading anything more by Doctorow ever again."
3,OK,"I purchased this for a class, and can't remember loving it or hating it. It does get kind of crazy at the end if I remember correctly though."
1,Doctorow's Post-Civil War New York Mystery a Disaster.,"E.L. Doctorow's change-of-pace mystery is a disaster.Lacking in this novel is almost everything that makesBilly Bathgate and World's Fair great: the narrator's attemptsto interpret the universe, the way in which the characters'minds work, and the exceptional prose. This reads likesome long-abandoned idea given a second go in order tocomplete a book contract! Infinitely shorter than Doctorow'sother books, the reader will nevertheless feel as if he orshe has just endured a long walk through deep mud fornothing. Read Billy Bathgate again instead."
5,Water Based Fire Suppression Systems,"The book represents a powerful opportunity to understand those basic concepts that characterize water based fire suppression systems. Chapters are very well written and plenty of examples which represents an helpful tool to gain a deeper understanding.For those whose have deep knowledge in the subject area already, I do advice to get the book anyway. It is essential for a good personal collection."
2,Not as remembered,"Seems as if this movie was redone before being put into DVD format. A lot was left out, but not the obvious spots where there were tv commercial breaks. Many scenes left out. I'd recommend looking for the original version."
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this pump after I read the reviews on this site. It did not perform as well as I thought it would. It is complicated and difficult to put together. It doesn't have extra parts except the storage container. Which means you have to wash it after everytime you use it. So pumping several times a day is a hassle. I have a fast flow and it still takes me like over 10 minutes to pump one ounce! I personaly don't have that much extra time. It is not very comfortable to use either, actually it hurts. Save your money and buy an electric Medella on E-bay or at a consignment shop."
1,Manual Breast Pump,"This is a piece of junk! I bought this when I left the hosiptal with our daughter and ended up getting rid of it and buying and electric one. I try useing this pump twice and did not even end up with an oz of milk. You can find electric ones that are not that much, and they work fine. This pump is cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Ok if you don't mind pooring into the Playtex disposibles,"I like the one handed use because with my first child I had a pump that you had to use both hands to pump milk, but one of the clerks at the Babies ""R"" Us in Albuquerque, NM told me that the pump would fit the Playtex Disposible bottles and since the box has a seal on it I couldn't take it out and see for myself. Well when I got home that is the first thing I did and it DOES NOT FIT THE PLAYTEX DISPOSIBLE BOTTLES it is to big and the Avent is slightly to small so the adapter ring that comes with the Playtex set is useless."
1,Never again!,"I bought this pump just to use at work. I wasn't going to use it that often, so I looked for a cheap inexpensive one. Well, that's what I got was ""cheap"". I hadn't even used it for a month and now it hardly suctions and the handle has become loose. It says that there is a 90 day limited warranty, but from what everyone has said about their customer service, they are rude. Why go through all the hassle. I had thought about calling, but decided not to. I know that I wasted $20 and I got what I paid for. Another bad thing is about this product is that you can't feed from the jars that come with it. You end up having to transfer the milk to a bottle anyway if you're going to feed instead of store that milk that day. I decided to get a Gerber Massaging Manual pump and it work a lot better and is more comfortable. Just like everyone else, I wished I had read the reviews before I bought this. It pays to spend a few more $$ in order to get a better product. Cheap is not always better."
2,Large diameter bits only,"Description incomplete. Think this was designed for wood auger type bits. This is not what I needed or wanted. However, I made it work."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I could have thought this out better, but I expected a drill bit extender would be useful in hard to reach places...wrong. The too large head prohibits getting this into many places, most places I need to extend a drill bit! The only typical use I can imagine is with a drill press to extend the length of the drill-to-table and I do not have the purpose. Sits in the drill drawer."
3,You can get additional states cheaper,"I have not used this year's version of TT State yet, but a few years ago I had to file in two states. I bought the multi-state edition (the purpose is for TT to only have to make one version of the software to sell nationwide, not for customers to be able to use more than one state) and by calling Intuit, I was able to get a registration code for the second state for less than the cost of buying a second copy of the software. Yes, it's inconvenient, but it still beat the cost of hiring an accountant."
1,"Be aware, Intuit does not listen","I have been a loyal customer for Intuit's product. When I found out the short-fall on its State Tax software and e-mail an alert to them. They did not respond, neither did they correct the mistake in order to improve the next year. So every year, I had to manually override it and get it done correctly. The mistake I was talking about is the ""Two-Income Deduction"" for Maryland filers."
5,Good resource to generate ideas!,"Loaded with letterhead styles and logos, I found this book to be a great resource with lots of good inspiration!"
4,Not as good as 'Crush' but still solid,"I finally bought the CD to replace my old vinyl copy from 1986. Amazon was the only place I could find a brand new copy. The album is very melodic and a pure classic from OMD's late releases, but not as strong as the album 'Crush' from 1985. Its to bad Paul left the group after this one. Every song fits neatly into one another. Very well put together songs. Best songs are 'Forever live and Die', 'Shame', 'Goddess of Love', and 'Watch us Fall'. ***Highly recommended***"
5,LOL,"We all know this are kind of dumb movies. But, that does not take the fact that they just make us laugh and that is their whole point: TO MAKE US LAUGH. maybe a little maybe a lot. Parodies like these are just to crack up laughing (in my opinion at least) and they serve its purpose greatly by combining 3 movies in high-definition in a single great-price combo for our satisfaction"
5,"Valencia, CA","Outstanding! Many a night we have gone to the video store in search of the latest releases only to find that they are all checked out. This finally ends our frustration. Tatham opens the eyes of the consumer and shouts at them that there are hidden gems on those dusty shelves marked ""comedy"", ""drama"" and ""action/adventure"". He also makes it almost (and I mean almost) palatable to rent a movie with subtitles. His acidic commentary on not only the plot summaries but also the genre of the films he is recommending is ""laugh out loud"" funny. It makes you wonder why the television networks aren't using this guy to lift their I.Q. demographics. 1001: A Movie Odyssey is a must have for the cinema connoisuer. It's a video bible. This should be handed to you right after they cut your umbilical cord and slap you in the ass."
4,The Misfits,"The ""new"" Misfits, with Michael Graves doing the vocals, have recieved a lot of press lately, and have even appeared on WCW wrestling. If you have never heard there music, its like nothing else, and they really cannot be categorized as punk or anything else. This CD is the ""old"" Misfits, with Glen Danzig singing. (the guy who sang ""Mother"") Most of the Misfits songs are about halloween, skeletons, demons, etc. They are very catchy, and you will not regret buying this CD."
3,Like New?,I was told this album was like new. Put the CD in and it wouldn't play through completely. Kind of disappointed with my order. :(
5,Horror Rock,An essential cd if you are into punk rock or just love good music in general. The Misfits style melds vintage horror film lyrics with Danzig's unique voice and a raw yet simple sound. Every track on this album is a winner and like Operation Ivy or Led Zeppelin you will find that fans of the band vary on what songs are the best; there are just so many quality tracks to be found. The recordings on this album aren't crystal clear but do not let that deter you from checking this album out. A good starting point (perhaps the best choice) if you are new to the misfits.
5,Nice Craftsmanship,"Again, I purchased this zippo for my husband the collector, but this zippo is of much higher quality. It is a nice addition to his collection. It is very nicely done. I know he'll love this one."
3,Give it a try,"This may be a great book for the right person, but halfway through I became overwhelmed with all the detail. It is well written, just too much for me. I do yoga and seek enlightenment and after attempting to finish this book I realized I needed some lighter."
5,"Autobiography of a Yogi, P. Yogananda","This is a spiritual classic. It is a must read for those who wish to learn more about inner wisdom and connection to the divine, regardless of religious or cultural background. Read this and get inspired from witnessing the life journey of a true spiritual master."
5,A life-changing account,"Yogananda was one of the greatest spiritual figures of the 20th century -- we are very fortunate to have his autobiography!This book is full of wisdom. Whether you read it quickly, or decide, like some do, to take the time and try to gain a deep understanding of yoga, you are bound to be inspired.One of the wonderful things about Yogananda's writings is that they are so universal and accessible. Even my grandmother, an Episcopalian, is a big fan of his! This is one of those classics that can be appreciated by anyone who is open to true spiritual teachings, no matter their source.To me, this original, unedited edition is also especially powerful. It seems to more purely express what I like most about Yogananda. I highly recommend it!"
3,Very Van Halen,"This was a band that stupidly played the hair band game and really if they took the high road they might still be around today. Good songwriting, decent hooks, great guitar player.... bad image. Maybe a little too much leaning on Eddie Van Halen sound? That can be forgiven because everyone wanted to be Eddie Van Halen This showed a lot of promise and hairspray... Even the drummer. he had short hair but you could see the amount of hairspray involved in his hair. Image kills no matter what you think."
4,"Where's ""Wonderful Life"" & ""Sweetest Smile""???","This is a great album. I have all his tapes from day one (1987-1988) wanted to buy the CD album...but what happened to the missing tracks ""Wonderful Life-re-recorded version"" and ""Sweetest Smile-re-mix""?The two missing tracks from the ""Comedy"" album originally released by A&M; is different from this newer album. The re-mixed tracks from the older album are both unique in their own way.Four stars for this album, minus 1 star for the missing tracks. Will re-master the original A&M; released cassette (with the missing tracks) to CD instead.Disappointed!!!"
4,"Ozu, Most Japanese of the Japanese directors","Ozu has been called the most Japanese of all Japanese directors, and for good reason, he is. Ohayo (Good Morning) is Ozu at his Japanese best. There is a misunderstanding among the neighborhood ladies. Some club money has turned up missing. The misunderstanding is compounded by two boys, who after an argument with their parents, are told to shut up. The boys want a television set, the parents do not. The boys take their parents admonition to shut up to the extreme, they stop speaking to everybody, even the neighborhood ladies. These ladies find that their customary greetings of ohayo (good morning) to the boys goes unanswered. The ladies feel that the boys mother is angry at them and a neighborhood quarrel ensues. Finally the parents relent, the boys get their television set so life resumes to normality once again, everyone is happy. No action, just everyday life."
2,50 ways of going nowhere with PE2,"I really regret buying this book. It is supposed to be an easy tuorial well suitet to beginners like myself. Most of the examples are easy to understand, but I found the explanations of using the different tools somewhat variable. My main objection however is that only a fraction of the pictures used in the step by step tutorials are available ( and only as a download from the publishers website). Not being able to play around with the examples and follow the the author all the time made the learning process much harder. Why the author/ publisher has not bothered to make all the material used in the examples available I do not understand."
3,Its the Harry Potter of computer books,"This book was amazing it showed me how to make beautiful pictures in a way that even I could do it. The writing is easy to understand and a great sense of humor. This book is the Harry Potter of computer books, you just cant put it down."
5,Excellent collection of the music of the swingin' sixties,"As time goes by, Sammy Davis Jr. might be better known for a few of his top hits that got the radio play - Mr. Bojangles, and The Candy Man. But Davis was at his peak in the mid-sixties, and this is a terrific selection of music of the era.The arrangements display a classic sixties styling, and so do his interpretations. It's a great mix of uptempo songs and ballads. For good songs, sung with style and verve, it's tough to beat this album.Good material, served up right!"
5,As Velvet As It Gets,"Bare none one of the very best indie bands from the genisis of indie bands & Only Life is a perfect example of their greatness.If you were on any East Coast campus in the late 80's, you are well aware of New Jersey's best band (next to Yo La Tengo) Yes....... another one of countless bands inspired by the hallmark Velvet Underground, but the Feelies are surely in a class of their own. Some of the best words & music ever written & If you don't fully love this band I'm sorry you're nuttier than Mr. Peanut."
2,A totally forgettable album,"I bought this album after hearing the Feelies open for REM many years ago. Every year or so, I pull the CD out to try to remember why I bought it. It's all pleasant enough while I'm listening to it, but a moment after the CD has ended, I can't remember a thing I heard. It never leaves any impression.Singer/songwriter Glenn Mercer is trying so hard here to sound like Lou Reed that he crosses the line from disciple to copycat. The playing is solid, but none of the songs are anything special. ""Higher Ground"" and ""Away"" are what pass for highlights here. If you want to hear someone sound like Lou Reed, why not just put on a Lou Reed CD?"
3,Sad goodbye...,"This was as disappointing as might be expected, but I had to check out his last gasp. I loved the whole series."
1,The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey,"This book should never have been sold ,especially for Kindle. Very dissapointing to receive only half a book. There should be a method of refund."
1,3 Chapters? What a lazy author!,"Boy, talk about resting on your laurels! Three chapters and some after-dinner scraps of writing and that's it? O'Brian's got a lot of explaining to do if you ask me.As far as I can tell Aubrey makes admiral but still has to put up with the blow-hard antics of an even higher officer and Maturin, getting soft in his old age, DOESN'T kill some impetuous officer in a duel. And what's with Maturin's homicidal fascination with honor and dueling? Small manly parts, methinks.""Captain, the surgeon and doctor of our ship is about to engage in a duel over some mispronunciation of a word and if he loses, your ship will be without its medical staff, resulting in disease and death during its voyage.""""Duel? Maturin? Well, let him go ahead and fight to the death. Better that than the welfare of my sailors. Ha Ha Ha.""I hope that O'Brian can pull himself away from whatever he's doing to write a longer 22nd novel. Maybe he'll even take the time to give it a real title."
3,Loss of two friends.,"I wasn't sure I wanted to read the last book knowing that it was unfinished, but I'm glad I did. I found Patrick O'Brian's hand writing very hard to read to I didn't read those very far. I do feel the sadness of not knowing how Captain Jack and Dr. Maturin turnout, maybe it's the best. It is a peaceful thought to think that they are still sailing out there some where and maybe I'll see the HMS Surprise on the horizon from my boat some day. I still suggest stopping at book 20 and the good news that it ends with."
2,Deserves a better ending!,"Having recently read all of the Aubrey/Maturin Series, I was glad to have the opportunity to read the unfinished draft. Like many others, I wished that the last number of pages were typed. It was obvious that Mr. O'Brian had plans for many more episodes and I regret that his fans will not see more of Aubrey/Maturin. I will miss Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. I have on occasioned thought that I would not want to die before finishing an exceptionally good book. Now I know what that might be like!"
2,bvadly written attempt to save nothing,"bad attempt to save a badly written series to begin with,one is supposed to read hand written notes?,and then the printed word?,in an attempt to save what little there was that the author left?,don't waste your money"
5,Awesome!,"Just listened to my giant cd that I received from amazon.com. Still awesome after 22 years. Great tunes. Not a hair band. No bs, just great music and lyrics. Love it. Pick up last of the runnaways now! Highly reccommended..."
4,An enduring free jazz landmark,"There probably wasn't much more to be done in free jazz after this disc came out in the late '60s. The fact that Shorter and his band wrung so much expressiveness and even bits of tunefulness out of this chaotic, abrasive genre at that late date is a tribute to their talent. The band included guitarist Sonny Sharrock and future Weather Report bandmates bassist Miroslav Vitous and percussionist Airto Moreira. John McLaughlin also contributes his considerable presence on one track. This is a good disc for someone ready to make the leap from pop music to pure jazz--you'll be in capable hands."
3,Important tracks missing,"Where's ""Hand Held in Black and White"", ""Videotheque"" and ""Give Me Some Kinda Magic""?Where's ""Give Me Back My Heart""?Who put together this collection?"
3,Good singer,"I only bought this CD for Celebration, the other songs are ok, I just didn't really get into her singing that much"
1,worst movie ever,"dont even think about buying this movie. it makes no sense, the graphics/ make up fx are the worst. the ""bats"" are actually plactic toy rats with papers wings glued on. one scene the mayor cuts his finger off, the next scenes he has the finger again. horrible."
4,Good collection but missing a few gems...,"First of all, anything produced/written/performed by David Foster is worth listening to. Now, having said that, this particular collection is missing some of his best work, namely: Paul Anka's ""Hold Me Til The Morning Comes"", Boz Scaggs' ""Love, Look What You've Done To Me"", and El DeBarge's ""Who's Holding Donna Now?"". Also, none of his solo work is reflected here, with the exception of the theme to St.Elmo's Fire. But, despite all of this, the CD is still worth the purchase price for the simple reason that you get the nice digital-quality versions of songs like Air Supply's ""Goodbye"", Chaka Khan's ""Through The Fire"", and Peter Cetera's ""Glory of Love"" that were all released in the analog 80s."
5,Just what I wanted,"They fit well. At first I thought they were snug, but I realized I've been wearing sunglasses that were much too large for too long. I am comfortable in these, there is no distortion to the lens, and they don't fall off. They look pretty good too."
2,Not what I expected,"I really wish I had realized it was a fan only and not a light. It never occurred to me that a product this expensive wouldn't include a light.I think the fan itself is a good, heavy-duty product but the ""plane"" parts are just very lightweight material you adhere to the ceiling. It has been a very expensive and upsetting lesson for me."
4,"Thought provoking, fascinating, a few flaws","The essays, individually, were very strong, and collectivelymake for quite an interesting read.Pro: Funny in places you don't expect; don't miss the""Clitoral Hoods"" response to censorship at CMU, or numerousother great touches.Con: It is a little disorienting to receive (it seemed)6 explanations of Usenet in a row. It seems like carefulediting could have prevented the essays from these tediousredundancies.More importantly, I found all the essays to be worth mytime reading, save one: the sensationalistic piece of tripeabout ""hacker's attitudes towards women."" I can onlyconclude that the author of this piece was hopelessly naive,or else was going out of her(?) way to create a piece offiction doing justice to every adolescent male's fantasiesof hacker eliteness. So cliche riddled it would have mademe laugh if it hadn't been so far removed from the restof the book in quality.In sum: excellent essays, well worth a read, skip theunspeakable hacker essay."
4,Surprised and pleased,"I wear size 13's and I was having a bear of a time finding shoelaces that were long enought to tie comfortably. I was using boot laces in my sneakers, and that was just a bad combination. I found reference to the yankz when I went looking to order longer laces online, and I took a shot. They took a little bit to set up (and having a partner to adjust them while I stood helped immensely) but once that was done, I was very happy with the results. I now slip my sneakers on and off, and they are snug but comfortable. I've already annoyed my family with my enthusiasm for them."
3,Flapper that doesn't Flap,"This is the third summer I have had the Dragonfly ""Flapper"" and it has never really moved as it should. I've tried adjusting it so it's wings are at an angle to the breeze and that doesn't even make a difference. Something with the balance and the weight must be off. It is very pretty, but I got it because I liked the hummingbird flapper I had gotten for my mom (which DOES flap)."
3,Not as Good,"The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Ilse Witch being the first, is not nearly as good as Brooks' previous Shannara books. The characters are one dimensional at best, the story badly plotted, and there is very little about the ""voyage"" that makes one want to invest time and energy into the story. If you're a die-hard Shannara fan, then buy and read them; otherwise, check them out from your local library."
3,"Entertaining, but overall unsatisfying.","Terry Brooks' latest story had me drooling in anticipation. The Shannara series is one of my all-time favorite series, and I bought the book the day it was released. Overall, the story is quite entertaining. It contains very imaginative situations, dynamic characters, and a fantastic plot. However, in the end it fails to be anything more than good. Brooks is planning on this being the first in a three book series, and I believe that is the main reason. It spends nearly the entire book setting the scenarios of the second book up. Anyone who has seen Star Wars: Episode One will know what I mean. It's a good read, and I'd recommend it to anyone, but it is by no means Brook's best (read Elfstones of Shannara for that) nor is it anything special. Perhaps the second and third books will revive the Jerle Shannara series into something spectacular."
3,nice character development... plot development not the best,"I purchased the book and in my usual habit completed it in a day and a half. The characters seem to be the same characters from previous books in the Shannara series with new names and slightly different looks. The problems faced by Walker in Ilse Witch are by the characters own statement ""easily bypassed"". In previous series Terry Brooks has managed to make first books in a series somewhat more interesting with greater conflicts to be solved. The conflicts faced by Walker don't have enough of the ""evil creation"" attitude about them. I see Ilse With as a set-up book for the rest of the series though and hope for much better in the remaining books... unfortunately it seems I'll have to wait a year or so to find out. As a devoted fan of the Shannara books I'm terribly disappointed in Ilse Witch. Had some greater confrontation occured during the book I'd be much more impressed."
2,Something is missing . . . .,"The book is missing an ending. I can appreciate that Brooks writes series and that no one book usually wraps up a complete story. But this is taking the teaser approach a bit too far for a book this long. It is obvious that Brooks is taking his fan base for granted and has done us a disservice. I will read the sequel, but I might not even start the next story line Brooks peddles. I'll take Raymond Feist over this any day."
2,Weak.,I am a fan of Terry Brooks but this was very disappointing. Maybe its because I just finished a Storm of Swords by George R. R. Martin which is 10 stars.
5,Great new tale of Shannara,"This is one of the best Shannara books that I have ever read. This new book starts out 100 years after the last Shannara book left off, and is a great read. The books starts out with Walker, one of the characters from the last book, but also has other new characters, new villians, and a completly new quest as they undertake a search for lost magic. This book is everything that a Shannara novel is, with magic swords and an epic quest and fights against evil, and it completly surpassed all my expectations of it!"
1,It sucketh,"Sorry to all you who grew up reading Shannara, and thinking this is what passes for fantasy. I recommend you look backwards in time [Charles Williams, J R R Tolkien] or forward [George Martin, Robin Hobb, Elizabeth Haydon] if you want to see some talent in the field. Brooks cruises through, making use of other people's ideas as always. This book stinks."
5,A Moving Story,"This book really got under my skin! A coming of age story set in the late 50s, the characters in this YA have so much depth. Definitely a good read."
4,Very Good but dragged a bit toward the end.,"A SF version of My Dinner with Andre. For a book that is basically 2 men talking, I found it very enjoyable. I thought it was one of John Barnes better character novels. I am not sure why but I seem to give all of John Barnes books 4-5 stars for the first 1/2 and less for the end. I guess I do not like the way he leads up to his endings. I can't put my finger on why but I found 30 of the last 40 pages tough to read."
5,Hard Rock Barbie,"My daughter is 20 years old and plays Guitar Hero and is into skulls, so I couldn't resist. She did love it. Super cute. I've always liked barbies and so does my daughter...still."
1,Saddened,I have been a huge fan of The Whispers for about 35 years or more. The songs that I have been searching for were listed on the CD description however when it arrived they are not included on this CD. I am very disappointed because I already have a compilation cd which includes three of the best cuts on this cd.
5,Great seat but not for all cars,"This is the safest infant seat on the market, however, check your car first. I own a 04 Acura TSX (4 door) and after taking the seat and base to Police Department to have it installed by a professsional, the seat could not be put in the middle position in the back. The middle seat was so high compared to the side seats that the base could never be level. The professionals did not feel this was safe for the baby. My husband owns a Dodge Durango and the seat fit perfectly in the middle. I am not going to buy a new seat, I am going to buy a new car. I just wanted to write this review so it was not assummed that this seat would be safe in the middle of all cars."
4,A Beautiful But Troubled Future & A Mysterious Man,"Like most of Terry Dowling's writing, this book is excellent and his representations of a future Australia and of the main character, Tom, are vivid and evoke questions about the directions any society can take.I love reading Dowling's imaginative and powerful creations and come back to them again and again."
1,awful,"I wanted to learn more about chakras. What I got was an overpriced piece of crap. I think you need to be on drugs to like this. Voice and music for mediation or something, and graphics that seem like an acid trip."
5,Great Graphics!,"Great graphics, music, very very well done.I personally would not know if 100% accurate, but really enjoyed it. Interesting and beautiful, moves right along too."
3,Not the best,"Anodea Judith reads prose in a flat toneless voice. The graphics are wonderful, but as for the Kundalini experience or a great colour meditation, I think it lacks. Why? The colour of the chakras is only strong and consistent in two of the chakras (the solar plexus and its yellow graphic images, and the throat with its blue graphics). The rest of the chakras are depicted in a whirl of various colours that take away from the immersion in colour that a good open eyed colour meditation can provide. Shirley Mclaine's (circa 1990) open eyed colour meditation comes to mind as a great example with a mind altering after effect.This DVD seems to be more of a basic introduction to the chakras than a useful tool to use repeatedly."
3,Great artwork but very limited information,"The only reason I gave this video 3 stars is because the artwork in the video is absolutely amazing. With the potential to be an amazing video I feel that the lack of information about the chakras ruined this video. If you are new to chakras and need to know the basics, then I would definately recommend this video to anyone. However it seems the amount of information actually explaining the individual chakras can all be found on a free brochure from you local holistic living center or on the web.In a nutshell if you don't know anything about chakras and/or just want to see some amazing chakra artwork then definately buy this DVD."
4,Covers everything for the Star Wars enthusiast,"I received this book as a Xmas gift from my big brother. Really clearly written - good sized pictures as you would expect from DK.Easy to read and informative. I found out quite a few facts that I didn't know before getting this book. I have many other Star Wars books - the fold out cross-section ones and the large format ones specific to each episode - but this is still a good addition as it covers aspects such as the comic books, George Lucas and spin-offs."
3,Very nice mascara goes on like not waterproof no clumps,"This is one of my all time favorite mascara's so far. I have very thin lashes. It goes on very smoothly w/out thick clumps. Really defines each lash nicely.Down side is some dark smearing under eyes, but I do use some under eye cream that may contribute to that.Wonder if there is a Waterproof mascara out there that can take the heat/humidity down here w/out smearing under eyes."
3,So So,"It does change color, but emits a very strong resin odor when used.There is a seam in the center, and this allows the face to ""fog"", making it difficult to see the bars.I've found that following the bars exactly makes for overcooked eggs.As part of my sports nutrition program, I must eat 4 egg whites per day. I thought this product would make it easier to get more ""perfect"" eggs, but it hasn't really done so. It's a nice gimmick, but didn't change the world for me."
1,JUNK,doesn't work for me- it made my eggs taste funny and not precise i hate it . thats all i have to say.
1,What about Mary Carewe and the Louis Vause Orchestra?,"I loved that song with Sienna Miller 'In the Cool, Cool, Cool in the Evening'. But where the heck is it? I can't find it ANYWHERE?"
3,Good Stuff,"There are like three complete Jagger songs on this CD that are repeated in different versions and turned into six or seven songs, a few one riff instrumentals, a couple songs by other artists, Mick's stab at writing a Christmas song, and a cameo by Sheryl Crow and you have a complete album. Ok, it is not the Stones but it is good. It is Mick as we have come to accept him. But I like it and it is worth a couple of bucks."
4,Alfie 2004 soundtrack,Hi pls let me know the jazz track at the beginning of the movie Alfie 2004 where Jude Law is getting dressed up ... the jazz track starts after a couple of scenes
1,Buy anything else but this,"From a dedicated, longtime Stones fan and collector of everything and anything Stones related, take heed: this one is just horrible. Jagger's collaboration efforts with someone else other than Keith Richards goes horribly awry once again. Save your money for Live Licks due out Nov. 2, 2004, instead."
3,"This soundtrack CD is good, but not at all complete","I agree with the other reviewers that the music on this CD is wonderful.Please be aware however that it only includes the movie songs by Jagger and Stewart.It does not include some songs used in the movie that I consider legendary:- THE BEAT GOES ON drummed by Buddy Rich and sung by his 12year old daughter, accompanying the love scene of Alfie and Liz.- LOVE TKO by Hall & Oates and FOR THE LOVE OF YOU by The Isley Brothers, accompanying the love scene of Alfie and Lonette.- The two pieces that accompany the first scene when Alfie wakes up and dresses, and the scene when Alfie drives and talks to Liz at the same time (""I lost the signal for a second there"")I suppose they has been written exclusively for the movie because it is totally in tune with the plot, fingersnaps, etc. There are also variations of it later in the movie.If anyone know the title and performer of this fabulous jazz track, please post it here as a review."
5,Gorgeous and Easy to Assemble,"This mobile is very nice looking, we have the 5 piece bedding set as well and it goes perfectly with that. We are still 6 weeks away from our daughter's due date, but it seems like she should really enjoy the teddy bears and nice music. Big bonus: the music has an on/off switch! I got it up and on the crib in under 10 minutes I'd say, and that was even with changing my mind on which side I wanted to put it on :D."
5,quality work gloves,"I use many different type of gloves for agricultural, hay, work. These lasted better than any I have used in the past and were soft as well. Hint, after you think you have about worn them out and the insides are no longer comfortable, turn them inside out and rip out the lining. The lining is very nice to start, but soon gets full of hay, dirt, etc. but by then the leather is very soft and the lining is no longer needed. In the winter, just wear a pair of cotton jersey gloves inside for added warmth."
1,Very pretty - mechanical disaster,"I just bought this beautiful watch. Was in love with it for 12(!) hours. Next morning I discovered that the watch stopped. The self-winding feature is not working. In a brand new watch! While manually winding it I noticed something rattling inside and a tiny screw fell out and lodged between the hands under the glass. AMAZING! Now the back of the watch has a special cover that can only be opened by a manufacturer or a jeweler with a proper 'key'. You can't ""accidentally"" get into it - there is no battery to change. So ridiculous! It's a gorgeous piece of totally embarrassing craftsmanship. I am returning it today for refund - this is not worth exchanging."
4,This is a Great Scarf but...,"I own this scarf and love it. However shopper be advised that the colors in the computer image are not true to life. Where the image shows muted sherbet and melon colors, expect vibrant green and hot pink! If you are a person who collects cat scarves you will not care, and certainly the silk is top quality - but as color can be a huge factor in clothing accessory decision making this is something that must be said."
5,Inspiring,"I found Yesterday's Warrior to be inspiring. While, it deals with many difficult topics, the author did a wonderful job of telling her ""truth."" It is a very eye opening account into the worlds of drug addiction and child abuse. It is amazing that hope can come out of something so dark."
5,perfect paradise lost soundtrack,"this album is perfect for everything,and I mean everything,his beautiful invoking sounds are just divine in so many ways,I'm not surprised if angels weep when they hear it..."
5,On my fourth unit,"bought my first dolphin about 6 years back (maybe even longer) and i stick with it. they last well over a year and as another reviewer remarked, they just eventually vibrate themselves out! for the money, you should do yourself a favor and at least give it a try. you see a few others on here that stand by this device and are loyal customers. if it ain't broke, don't fix it. but mine done worn out again...;)"
5,Loved it!,"I bought the glass flapper flamingo as a gift for someone and they loved it. It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be which was wonderful. The packaging of it could have been a little better. The nose was bent after taking it out of the box but luckily it wasn't too bad. Overall very satisfied with my purchase, it was beautiful."
5,Historic Cookery,I thought this old book about traditional New Mexico cooking would be out of print and impossible to get. I was thrilled to get it. Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert spent her adult life trying to preserve New Mexico traditions and to honor the hard working people on the Llano.
4,"Love the Book, HATE the Cover","This book is really smart and compassionate and sensitive. Too bad it has such a cheap cover. Dr. Kerner seems to be speaking to the average woman, and even talks about how magazines and media lead to a constant male gaze following women everywhere, but then he undermines his message with the type of women that magazines use to create anxiety. He probably had no choice, but it puts out mixed messages. I only hope when the book comes out in paperback that they'll use a more realistic women. Then it would be nearly perfect."
2,An Insult to Female Intelligence,"This book does nothing to help women ""Raise Your Standards and Reach for the Love You Deserve"". If anything, it does the same thing the other book about which the author has a ""reply"" about, and that is to continue to widen the divide among men and women, certainly not bringing the opposite sex together in any manner whatsoever. IMHO it is books like this that have women continuing to scratch their heads wondering WHAT to do in a relationship.Try getting real, with yourself. There's no need for the oneupmanship either between the sexes or in the literary genre.There are better books on the market that bring the opposite sex together, without insulting the intelligence of either one. This book is not one of them, and neither is the book written in its namesake."
1,not as good as He's Just Not That Into You,"He's Just Not That Into You is my bible so I was thrilled when I saw this one on the shelf. It is written by a different writer, and it just has a completely different read (tone, mood, feel). I didn't even get through it, don't waste your money and go get He's Just Not That Into You on audiobook (this is NOT the sequel)."
4,At least it's feminist,"He's Just Not That Into You set feminism back a good 30 years, and i guess it speaks to the 50s housewife in all of us. Who doesn't want to be married? Me for one. Not that I'm ruling it out, but not at the cost of totally demeaning myself either at all costs. While this new book isn't exactly brilliant, it's an important response to the first one because it evens things out a little and tries to put the power back in the hands of women. What really bothers me though is that all these book for women are being written by men. Do we really need men to tell us how to date and fall in love? I don't think so, but if we are going to take our advice from a man, I prefer to take it from a feminist. Also, there's a great chapter by Amy Sohn, and the author's wife seems very strong and funny too."
3,"Interesting, Useful and Ridiculously Expensive","First of all don't get your hopes up. This book is a big list of words organized loosely into several thematic chapters: crime, politics, trade, military, health, law, etc. Each chapter is about ten or twenty pages. And the format is sparse. Here is the english term, here is a phonetic transliteration of the Persian, here is the Persian in traditional script. No examples, no text other than the words. It's a giant set of lists, period. Each chapter is organized alphabetically by the Persian. However there is an alphabetic index at the back that lists the page where every English term is found. The book is certainly convenient and it's very nice to have everything for certain topical areas ""right there"". But I'm not sure if it's $135 worth of convenient. For this price one could actually afford to buy three or four specialized dictionaries. I would probably buy it again. Just wanted everyone to know what they were getting into though."
5,Delightful family movie,"This is a surprisingly good little movie. The plot is not too much of a stretch and there are a variety of interesting characters. The acting is decent. All in all, it's pretty well done for a television movie. If you have ever been to Paris, this film will show you sights you have seen and then some. It's a good film for kids and adults alike."
4,A History of Economic Thought,"This was a short and concise introdution to the evolution of economic ideology. It was easy to read and provided sound examples. It is a very good starting point for an absolute novice to get a basic grounding, before going into more detailed texts or even the readings of the economists themsleves."
1,not worth the 99 cents,"Got it SS at 99 cent store. The barking doesn't really sound like dogs. The frog CD is funny, but this sucks."
5,Can't get enough of this CD!!!,I can listen to this CD over and over. Chris Pierce is awesome. I can't wait for the next CD release.
4,leaf blower sound effects,"these hunter humidifiers are ok, but the comments on the loudness are true.on low, it's pretty acceptable---kind of supplies a ""white noise"" effectto mask other sounds in the room. but ON HIGH-----IT SOUNDS LIKE A LEAF BLOWER!!!it does eliminate the whole problem of white dust, though, so that's good.cool air mist does really help sinus problems and allergies, too. it can make a HUGE difference when you're running the heat all winter."
3,Best part is no filter,"We have an older model, without the night light. We like it very much, but it does have its drawbacks. The HIGH level is very loud. That being said, the LOW level is not too loud and does what it is supposed to do. Mine does not shut off automatically, but we live in a dry climate.I think the fact that I don't have to deal with a filter is the best part. It is a decent pick up though."
4,good product,"i bought this humidifier for my daughters room. i like this humidifier, however, it does not have an automatic shut off which i do not like. you cannot just fill it and forget it. it has a nice big thank tho that does last a few days. it claims it is ""care free"" which i do not believe. unless you only use distilled water in it, you will get a nice black puddle of water on the bottom from minerals that must be poured out and cleaned periodicaly. i like that it has a nightlight, how ever my daughter doesnt like the nightlight so we dont use it often. i also wanted this one because it says it has a fan also, but the fan only turns on when the humidifier dial is on high, and cannot work independantly. i was prety disapointed with that. but over all its a good humidifier and keeps the whole room well humidified."
1,I agree - Not durable!,I had a Hunter humidifier and the fan stopped working after I put it in storage over the summer. But Hunter is sending me a replacement (but they said they've discontinued this model).
3,Features not made clear,"I had owned two of the Hunter humidifiers before and was looking to replace them. It was unclear from the descriptions just which humidifier I should get, as all the model numbers had changed. I wanted a model that automatically turned off when the water was gone. That is not what I got. And to make matters worse, their customer service people couldn't figure it out either, and were of no help whatsoever. I kept the new humidifiers, as they work fine and do the job. But I miss the automatic shutoff feature."
2,Doesn't Last - Noisy,"I was disappointed with this product. I had owned a Honeywell prior to buying this and was looking for a unit that did not require a replacement filter.The first thing I noticed was this unit took twice as long to humidify the room as my Honeywell. It was much less efficient at getting the water into the air.Secondly, it was noisy and started to rattle approx. 3 months after purchase. We use it only in the 3 months of winter.The next season I immediately noticed that it was really noisy. Long story short - the cheap little motor is shot.I threw this one in the trash and I'm back to using Honeywell humidifiers. The big difference is, Honeywell uses drum style fans which move air more quietly and much faster.Hope this helps."
2,Very Poor Quality in Recording,"I picked up this CD and was very, very disappointed with the recording quality. The very first song, ""All By Myself"", had background white noise like I was playing a 1940's LP record. The fifth song, ""Si Tu Me Amas"", had random clicks in it. I gave up listening to the CD after that.On a different note, I thought a few of the song selections were a little corny."
1,AND NOW: IL DIVO!,"Has anyone seen the advertisement for these guys. Please stop before I die of laughter. How could anyone take these guys seriously? I'm sure this will be or is a parody on SNL or Mad TV. It's outrageously funny. Thanks for the laughs guys, but seriously, enough with singing."
2,Disappointed,"I loved their first album and the Christmas collection. (I've listened to them over and over.) The mix of works is disappointing. The singing is beautiful and the orchestral back-up is nice, but there just isn't enough singing in English to keep my attention.I listen to CDs for entertainment, inspiration, relaxation. This one just didn't do it for me on any of those dimensions."
1,yikes,"I can only say this. Il Divo SUCKS.Bad singing, bad music, bad arrangements.Josh Groban styled this type of singing, if it can be called that, but FOUR Josh's at the same time. NO No No"
3,Still the Same Concerns as With Debut CD....,"I have always enjoyed the music of this group, but I still haven't figured out why ""Seb"" was chosen to complete this quartet. His voice is weak and reedy, and he should never be allowed to solo. His presence in this group is why I only give the CD three stars. The other three singers have glorious voices, and I grit my teeth whenever the Frenchman attempts to sing. He needs to be replaced by another classically trained singer."
1,"Tripe, pure and simple...","Okay, let me get this straight: If someone translates cheesy power ballads into a foreign language, and then hands it to a group of handsome but plain awful ""classical"" singers to warble, it becomes high art? Sorry, folks, but in reality it just equates to garbage.And yet, people have been scarfing it up and begging for more, while Simon Cowell and his four nameless drones roll around in piles and piles of money. God bless America. Or perhaps I mean God help us all..."
4,INSIGHT INTO KINSHIP CARE,"RELATIVES RAISING CHILDREN: AN OVERVIEW OF KINSHIP CARE provides the reader with excellent descriptions of the many issues found in the growing phenomena of family members raising their grandchildren or other relative children. Although written for the professional, the format is easy to follow and very thorough. The authors present the many possible prespectives of the child, the relative caregiver and the parent in this difficult situation. They also provide intervention techniques for the professional.As a child care specialist, I have been approached by people looking for help and information as they deal with relative care. Since I am not a therapist, this book provides a base of knowledge and has given me some insight on what referrals might be helpful for these individuals. Additionally, I will be recommending it to families interested in further in-depth information."
3,Rarer tracks have been dropped.,"Great to see that Australia still remembers Cyndi. This collection is similar to the 36 All-time Favourites which can only be imported into Australia. However, Track 28 is not ""Heading for the Moon"". Infact, that track is not even on the compilation. And whatmore, ""Right Track, Wrong Train"" is a notable absentee. The rest of the tracks are origional album versions. Recommended for those who do not already possess ""Goonies 'R' Good Enough"" or ""Hole in my Heart (All the way to China"". Budget priced, but not value added."
4,"5% Jung, 95% Practical Profiles of Archetypes","I like Joseph Campbell, but often you just want to yell, ""give me a list of the archetypes already and some modern examples!"" If you've ever felt that way, ""Heroes & Heroines"" is your book. A grand total of 16 archetypes are explored -- eight for men, eight for women. Each one is summarized with a simple four-paragraph character study, followed by a listing of qualities, virtues, flaws, styles, and common vocations. A short, but surprisingly dense section follows, where different permutations of archetypes are put together to explore how they clash, mesh and change. The book is at its best when it references characters from movies you've seen. It was written in 2000, so some of the films named are a bit dated, but if you're a film student, 90% of these would be on your list anyway."
1,"Stinky, sticky and not-warm!","These things stink, literally and figuratively. It actually smells when you open the package, and the patch itself has a sticky goo on one side that you are supposed to stick onto your skin. (You will get a light sticky goo all over your hands from applying the patch--and your hands will smell strongly of bengay.) But worse than that, these patches never actually get hot. They just ""tingle."" I have not found that stinky, sticky tingling provides any pain relief. But if you want your sore area to tingle, stink, and feel slimy for 8 hours, then this is the product for you. Personally, I will go back to buying Thermacare from now on. Thermacare patches are odorless, do not stick to your skin, and provide dry heat for 8+ hours."
1,"Who butchered ""The Promise""???","I only bought this collection for ""The Promise,"" a sentimental and longtime favorite movie of mine. I had streamed it a few times on Netflix and while their widescreen copy was very clear, I figured the DVD must be even better (it wasn't available on Blu-ray), and had been searching for it for several years. Well, the copy of that movie in this package is just awful! While it is spread across my entire 55-inch widescreen, parts have been cut off at the sides (for example, you can't see the pins when Collins knocks them over at the fair), there's some awkward pan and scan, and the picture is far from clear. Which means that I spent $12.49 for something I could have watched with far better quality for free. What a waste! I realize that Universal lists ""The Promise"" as a ""BONUS MOVIE,"" but what about those of us who only buy it for that movie? I think we should be warned about what we're getting! And I don't blame Amazon one bit for this."
3,pretty good,"Nothing special. My hair feels conditioned when I use it, but it doesn't style as nicely as when I use Kenra Volume shampoo and conditioner. Not bad, not great."
1,Missing Wrestlers,"Where is Mil Mascaras? He is one of the Greatest who has ever stepped into the ring. What about Pedro Morales, Don ""The Rock"" Muraco and The Ultimate Warrior. C'mon now."
4,good read!,Another good read from Leona McCourtney---not too intense; just good entertainment with a faith-base. You don't have to read the four books of the series in order to enjoy them.
4,Fun book,Glad to have some books to read that feature older ladies enjoying life! It is refreshing and fun to read..
5,I still wanted more,"If you are looking for a good clean mystery mixed with love, crime, family and friendship this is the series for you. I highly commendably it. You have to love a little old curious lady who is out to save the world. I was so pleased with this last book, I wanted to purchase and continue more!"
3,annoying religious dogma,"whilst this is quite an easy fun read, the constant religious references spoilt it...don't need to be preached to in a light hearted novel.....and her personal opinions on others choices (ie those who meditate or work with crystals) I found insulting..I doubt she would dare to to have those opinions to other 'formal' religions?"
4,"small face, but pretty cute.","The clock stands about 8"" tall, I think, but the clock face is only about 4"" in diameter, and slightly recessed, I cannot read it from a distance at all, but must pick it up to tell the time. It is cute, though, in a sort of cheap retro style. It inspired me to decorate my train-loving son's bedroom with a 1920's era train theme. The case is all plastic, and the second hand is not a hand at all, but is a disc of plastic with a train picture on it near the edge. As it ticks, it looks like the train is moving around the face of the clock. The ticking is a bit loud, FYI."
2,Onmyoji II,i didn't like the dubbed in English. I had seen is in Japanese and the wording in English where not correct.
3,Not the best,"Not the best book for up to date info...especially for girls/women who are into the sport. The advertising would lead you to believe that this book covers all areas, but I found it to be lacking in several areas and definitely missing some key pieces dealing with the female athlete."
5,Yellow Moon,I lent this cd to someone and it was never returned. I loved this album from the first time I heard it. Aaron Neville has the voice of an Angel. Only surpassed by Geoffrey Gurrumul
1,HAL would hate it,"A dreadful, boring (but mercifully short) sequel to Times Eye. What a disappointment. No conclusions to anything (alexandre vs Genghis, MIR, Firstborn, etc. etc.)...basically concur with all the previous reviews that blasted this tripe."
3,Sunstorm just a sun shower...,"I have to agree with the other reviewers in that ""Sunstorm"" does not tie up any of the loose ends left by the first book in the series. Biesa is such a minor character in this novel. The description of how the British Army puts her on psychological leave and gives her meangingless duties pretty much sums up her value to this book. The complex mathematical and quantum discussions do not add to the enjoyment of the book. I expected more from the sequel and suspect the authors may not have had a complete plot for the sequel at the time the first book was written."
4,fuel pump,easy install and works better then stock will tell friends about this unit and will use again thank you for your help
5,Fascinating Experience of African Storytelling,These 86 stories from many different countries of Africa portray the life and spirit of the African peoples and cultures. They truly communicate both wisdom and joy.
5,A Wonderful Singer,"This is one of Joan Armatrading's better recordings, well worth a listen. In particular, note the stark simplicity of ""Dark Truths."" It was used to great effect in one of the later ""Miami Vice"" shows. She has the perfect voice for such a song."
5,Different but great,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. This album hardly sounds like Joan Armatrading. However, that doesn't keep it from being a great album. It's just not what you might expect at first."
2,Beware: There is a low hum throughout the entire album,"Beware! It is seldom mentioned but there is a low hum throughout the entire record. It is deliberate and ruins the songs. Wikipedia says ""The album features a 'tone', a low-level drone that is in the background of every song, which Camille has described as 'her note'.""If I had known, I would not have bought the CD.Also, the final track is 4:51 of music, but is about 30 minutes long total, with a little babble at the end. Self-indulgent and not respectful of her audience. The last time that kind of trick was creative was when she was 10."
2,"Not awful, but not the place to start","If you're reading this, you're quite possibly a Matthew Sweet fan already, so maybe you should buy this album, which contains several reasonably decent songs (though arguably no great ones). If you aren't: please, for the love of the higher power of your choice, start elsewhere (e.g. _Girlfriend_ or _100% Fun_). Otherwise, you run the risk of encountering ""Underground"" and concluding that all Sweet has to offer are your worst memories from the eighties distilled into a very painful three minutes and 38 seconds. Which isn't the case, because the man got significantly better from here."
4,Great show and just-right music,"I grew up in a very trailer-trash and cars-in-the-yard town so I seldom get much entertainment vicariously re-living situations I went through by watching a TV show. But ""Earl"" was an amazingly funny and sometimes poignant program that reminded me that there were people worth knowing and times worth living in my home town. But the thing about this series that really reached me was the wonderful selections of music. The situation of the moment is positively enhanced and brought home when just the right song starts up.The actors carried their characters with skill and panache and made this series so much more than just another sit-com.G.T. Garcia created a gem with ""My Name Is Earl."""
5,fabulous soundtrack too,"I just discovered this show on re-runs. There is NO laugh track, but there ARE at least 4 abrigded rock & roll songs per episode. Great sitcom!"
5,:-),"It's My Name is Earl on DVD, 4 DVD disks with episodes of my Name is Earl, the first season of the show, my Name is Earl. So yeah I bought it. But I like the show. Funny show. 5 star funny. Mostly I brought it to see missed episodes. Episodes I hadn't seen, cause they havn't invented Tivo where I live.It's a feel good comedy, what more do you want."
5,Works great & easy to clean,"Decided to review this as someone was asking for a recommendation so I came here to show her the link. I was shocked to see it only got 2 stars overall as I've been very happy with my unit. I've had it @ 3 yrs. Super easy to use & clean. Not one complaint. Helps me sleep when allergies are bad & I can't stop coughing. I don't even take cough meds, just need this unit. Highly recommended."
1,3 days and gone,I bought this 3 days ago and I was barely getting used to struggling with the fan noise. Then the fan stopped working entirely. I returned it to Linens & Things and am buying a Vornado today. Stay away from this poor quality product.
1,Leaking after first use. DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!1,THIS IS THE BIGGEST LETDOWN I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. LEAKS EVERYWHERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ITEM IS STILL IN EXISTENCE!!!!!!!!!! i HAVE REPOSITIONED IT IN EVERY PART OF MY DAUGHTERS ROOM AND IT STILL LEAKS. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Noisy!,"This unit functions fine as a humidifier, but it is anything but ""whisper quiet"" as the manufacturer claims. Not only is the fan itself rather loud even on the lowest setting, but there is a distinct rattle produced by something in the unit which echos loudly through the house at night. I can easily hear it from any room in my 1000 sq. ft. house, even over light ambient noise like the TV or furnace blower."
3,"Invaluable information, but difficult to read","The story is of tragedy and chaos in the Guatemalan civil war. Whether specifically true or not, all of the events of the book happened to someone at some point in that country. It's more a story of a diminishing race and civilisation being forced to come to grips with a modernized world. The reason it is so difficult to read is the double translation from Quechua to Spanish to English. Menchu also tends to jump around from topic to topic a lot. I think this is an important story, but essential to students of Latin American culture and society. It is also important for the study of human atrocity as well as a great foundation for the culture and practices of Latin American Indian societies."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,"I sympathize with the people this book is about as I do all cultures, but I absolutely despise the embellished novels that supposedly chronicle the pain the people went through. In most if not all cases it is completely unnecessary and its a big let down when you find that one character is an amalgum of five different people or something like that. I found that to be the case with this novel as well as dave eggers' ""What is the what"" and just about every single supposedly true biography I've ever read. The first few chapters were very interesting but afterwards I literally fell asleep. I had a paper on this book due in two days and was so sick of trying to get through the whole thing that I just had to wing it and write around what I did read. It drags on and on and on. I recommend you read something else."
2,Why hasn't this damned book just gone away?,"I was wandering through the stacks of textbooks being read by students at an expensive, west-coast university recently and about passed out when I saw that this obscene waste of trees is STILL required reading.It says volumes about the totally intellectually debased education young people are getting and that their parents are taking out second mortgages to pay for.And then these same ignorant young adults go out and vote in droves for ""change."" Well, this is where that mentality comes from."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book hoping to learn about the Maya people of Guatemala. I discovered halfway through the book, that the author gave false testimony of her life. This was disburbing and made the rest of the read deflating. I'm glad I read it because I learned about her mindset and customs of her community. I realize that horrific atrocities were perpetuated against the Maya by the military and this book helped bring attention to the genocide. I believe that was important, but I'm disappointed that the author chose to create falsehoods. It brings her credibility, in general into question. In addition, the book was a difficult read - redundant and the layout of the narrative was confusing."
3,Not his best work,"I'm being generous when I give it three stars. I'm a huge fan of Bruce Dickinson, both his work with Iron Maiden and his solo work so I felt like I had to give him at least a passing grade.Born in 58 and Tattooed Millionaire are both catchy tunes, though simple ones that sound like they were written in a single evening. Can't say the rest of the stuff is much to speak of, so I won't.I've owned this CD for 3 year and haven't listened to it in probably the last year so I guess I must not think it's too great."
5,Adorable!,"As are all of the Douglas plush toys, this Corgi is just adorable! Very well made and my daughter loves it-she's in college! Great toy for any dog lover!"
3,"Good, but a little too monotonous and formulaic","This is a good album that the Human League put out in 1990. I got to hear it in early 1992. Heart Like A Wheel sounded good with its adventurous rhythms. Rebound is another good song--which brings me up to this. Most of this album is a little too repetitive, monotonous and formulaic, as the male and female lead singers repeat the choruses over and over as if in a rote manner. Such as On the Rebound sung some 50 to 60 times or so in Rebound. They're not feeling the songs as they sing them. It's a pattern and formula that continues in 8 of the 10 songs. Given that they went against some very heavy music competition in 1990, they did what they could on this album. But Dare from '81, the '83 album and the '95 album are far better albums to hear than this one."
4,"Well,...","...I'm married to one of them, a German former journalist, mother of two, whose tales could beat most of these... . Unfortunately, all the stuff she's written in the last 13 years is still in the computer, never sent off."
1,Yours ours and mine,"The movie is excellent, however the quality of the DVD is very poor. Stops and skips. The quality is not what was advertized."
5,"Yours, Mine & Ours","I purchased this for a ""Lucy"" fan. She absolutely loved the movie and would highly recommend it to anyone, even if you are not a huge ""Lucy"" collector. It is funny and makes for an enjoyable evening."
3,"Compared to today's movies, this is a good family movie","The majority of today's so-called family movies are filled with too much suggestive language, ideas and/or images. This is why I wanted a classic movie. I am ultra conservative so this film still contains a few things I am not pleased with. I suppose it was the beginning of the revolution in movies? The biggest disappointment was ""Lucy's"" reaction to her son reading playboy magazine. It was treated as if this is what young men do. I'm sure it was included in this movie to encourage other moms to feel the same. Well, I never will! I couldn't remember all the details from the first time I viewed the movie but if I had remembered that and the other few things I didn't care for in this movie, I would not have purchased it. On the other hand the movie does contain some wise words from the dad in the movie and the movie never showed or suggested this couple went to bed before the proposal. That was refreshing!!!"
5,Becoming a movie addict,My daughter loves the original movies when it comes to movies that have been re-made to update. She purchases the new versions and then asks if there is an older one. She was not disappointed with her choice on this one either. She continues to watch this over and over. You can't go wrong with Lucille Ball.
5,A wonderful family comedy to enjoy watching!,You can watch this film over & over and it's always funny! Despite being filmed in the 1960s the theme of single parents trying to raise their kids & the challenges they face is still a reality today. Actually with the high divorce rate in the US it's really a current theme. They show how lots of love & laughter can bring a family together. I love this film as much today as I did when I first saw it 20+ years ago! Keep this in your video collection and enjoy watching it with your family!
2,JUST PLAIN DISAPPOINTED,"... I WAS PLAIN AS TO WHY I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FILM, SO HERE WE GO AGAIN. CLEARLY FONDA AND BALL ARE 2 OF THE FINEST ACTORS OF THEIR TIME AND THATS WHY I EXPECTED MORE OF THIS FILM AND BASED ON THE OTHER REVIEWS THATS WHY I BOUGHT IT.. HERE ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR MY DISAPPOINTMENT. 1st.. THE CHILDREN DISPLAYED A LOT OF DISRESPECT FOR THEIR PARENTS WHICH TO ME IS NOT COMICAL. 2nd.. THERE WERE SEVERAL SCENES THAT I WOULD CONSIDER ADULT SITUATIONS AND SEXUAL IN NATURE ... 3rd.THERE WAS TALK OF SEX AND IN MY OPINION THIS DOES NOT MAKE FOR FUN FAMILY VIEWING.. FOR PARENTS WHO WANT TO SEE FONDA, BALL AND JOHNSON ACT TOGETHER WATCH IT, THEN YOU DECIDE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU WANT TO SHOW IT TO THE KIDS. ITS YOUR CHOICE!!!!"
4,great,I cant beleive how many children between them i like the part where they expect a child together .
3,Good material - but ...,"I concur with the others that said that this ""sounds"" like being copied from an LP. Actually I lost track of the number that were recorded directly from a vinyl source, but definetly the first two were, and at least two others. And this is too bad, because I REALLY like LSD (first track)."
5,"Spanish language, plus!","Beautiful movie, my daughter loves it and sees it every day. One of the most important things for me is that have Spanish language."
5,Good Backwoods Horror,"Sure its low-budget, and it starts off a little bit lame, but its setting you up for what is going to happen. I like the backwoods hillbilly horror movies. This one is not too over the top like some others; its very feasible. They are not inbred mutated monsters, but just normal people who decided to get away from the city, live off the land, and during though times they developed a taste for human flesh. They now lure unsuspecting outsiders to their land and...well...eat them, but not before spending a couple days chit-chatting and getting to know their ""meat"". Its pretty good. Its kind of nasty, when the guys first arrive at the house they are offered some disgusting looking soup, and little do they know they are eating their friends back meat! hahahaaa"
4,Love K&N Filters,These filters last which is why I use them. I purchased this for my Camaro and used it for several years. When I sold the car it was still working. Costs a little more but saves money by not having to purchase disposable filters every year.
1,Not very useful,"The problem with this item is that it takes up so much space and holds very little. It seems like I'm constantly struggling with powercords and games. The dividers are just arranged poorly. What I found works a lot better is just putting the power cord in my backpack and the PSP in a small generic case I got for $7. All of the accessories are useless, except the UMD cases. I don't need a lot of storage because at most I'm only playing one or two games at any given time."
3,Its not silver,"The one I received was black instead of silver like on the image. Still a good buy though.EDIT: When I ordered, it did not say colors may vary."
3,Sadly a poor quality handle attachment,"The case is great. Everything fits and the PSP is well protected. But, unfortunately, the aluminum piece that holds the handle breaks quite easily.This is not a case for banging around. I broke it by shutting the lid when the handle was sticking out, below the bottom of the case."
4,books,I have had a great experience by ordering used books. The last set of books (9) were sent in record time and was in very good shape.
5,Simply an amazing pop-rock album,"Trip Shakespeare is a band that deserved mainstream popularity, but never got the exposure their music was worthy of, even with the critical acclaim they received. This album is their quintessential recording: pristine harmonies, unique drum and bass work, atmospheric guitars. The songs are alternately funny (The Slacks; Snow Days), hard-rocking (The Nail) and heartbreaking (Late; Gone, Gone, Gone). Don't let the term pop music frighten you...this is great stuff."
2,Near Good,"This has some really good moments - the evil western outlaws as vampires is a great idea. The darker, sordid, violent scenes are the best (particularly the bar scene). It is absurd to criticise a vampire western on grounds of logic but by its own terms the film becomes confused and incoherent. This is mostly due to the clumsy attempt to resolve it in a happy ending. Maybe the film wouldn't have got funded if it had pursued its darker impulses to the end. The problem with endings like this is that it undoes the entire film - realigning all its subversive moments with a conservative, reactionary and frankly dull cause. In the end this apparently dark vampire western reveals itself as Little House on the Prairie dressed up for halloween."
3,I give it 2 and a half stars,It is an ok vampire movie. That creepy vampire kid is awesome. It is more of a dirty and gritty vampire movie if that is what you are looking for.
1,Why?,"Why would this be put on Blu-Ray? Why do people like this movie enough to give it 5 stars? Just, Why?"
4,Horror Flicks,"Purchased this movie for my son. He and his girlfriend love these kind of movies. They watched it and loved it - just that campy kind of movie that you watch and say "" Did I really just watch that""? Reminded me of the B movies from the 50's and 60's."
5,Near Dark,"Near DarkOne of the best vampire movies ever!! Worth watching just for the redneck bar scene.DVD arrived quickly & in great condition, as promised"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I just watched this movie and felt compelled to write a review to save someone from WASTING 1 hour and 1/2 of their time. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I watched it based on some of the positive reviews given here, but I can't understand why anyone in their right mind would give this a good review. WHO ARE THEY KIDDING? It was awful, believe me, AWFUL!! I am a big fan of horror movies and Vampire movies. Watch something like ""Interview with a Vampire"", ""The Lost Boys"", even ""Fright Night"" was way better than this crap!!!! There is a reason why ""Near Dark"" wasn't a popular movie!! Do yourself a favor, otherwise I'll be saying, ""I told you so."""
2,Whatever,"I really didn't think this movie was all that. I prefer something a little more traditional like with fangs and what not and a little more class. If vampires have been around for such a long time I would expect them to have acquired more wealth, stealth and intelligence over the years. A little more subtlety and finesse about there kills... graphic, yes, but as I said, more stealth and subtlety."
2,"Near Dark (DVD) Horror, Vampire","I saw this movie when it was released in the late 1980s. Fantastic movie. I never could find it on VHS many years ago, but I recently saw a blurb about it on cable and decided to hunt it down. Today I received the DVD and what a messed up version it was. Had I known that the director was narrating the entire movie, I'd never bought it. The constant droning narration nearly drove me crazy and totally ruined 'the movie'. I'm returing the DVD and going to try the VHS verison. Hopefully, the VHS won't have the awful narration, just the movie in all it's glory!!"
4,A Classic movie long overdue for a re-release,"I loved this movie when it first came out, it was such a cool version of the Vampire mythos, I thought they kicked serious [butt]! I've been waiting for years to get ahold of another copy ever since my tape bit the dust. I was disappointed to hear it was out of print until I just found out it was being re-realeased on DVD. A warning to Lost Boys fans, this is much darker. For instance Bill Paxton jumps up on the bar and slices open the throat of the bartender with his spurs, then grabs a mug to catch his blood so he could drink. Watch Lance Henriksen give a bullet back to the guy who shot him, after coughing it up!This movie was disturbing and really really cool. The music by Tangerine Dream was so ethereal, it was perfect. I think the only thing that held this movie back from mainstream acceptance was the amount of violence, it was pretty brutal what with all the bloodletting, shooting and general mayhem."
5,You can be part of human evolution!,"This book will give you the vocabulary and fundamentals to understand the world as an evolved result of life's history. I pick it up and read it very often; just opening it up from a random spot and reading about evolutionism. If you feel empty inside and need a way to explain this evolved life, this book will give you purpose to evolve and love life again. We did evolve to get here! And you can be part of the movement to evolve more! Humans have a purpose and Young's book lays out the past, present, and future ideas that we need to bring on the evolutionary change of today."
1,DO NOT BUY it from LG Outdoors,"I really hope that this cover is cool but, DO NOT BUY this item from LG Outdoors. They cancelled my order when I used my internationally issued VISA Card.Sorry to manufacture, this negative feedback is for LG Outdoors and I was going to order your product to use on my Burris Fullfield TAC30 LRS Scope and they cancelled it!"
3,you get what you pay for,"Well, It works (most of the time). But the quality is so so. Sometimes the latch cannot lock into the place. I have to ""shake"" it a couple of times to make it work. I also notice the possible overcooking problem mentioned in another review when you toast multiple bagels in a short duration. So I turn down the temperature gradually."
3,Works... sort of,"This is an inexpensive toaster. And it operates as such. It works. So, I do get toast but it is inconsistent in the darkness of the toast when you put in a second batch immediately after using it. Keeps coming out darker and darker or burnt.Would suggest purchasing a better brand or higher priced toaster. The old saying does apply: ""You get what you pay for."""
1,Complete waste of time!,"I paid $14 at Best Buy just out of curiosity. It was like a pathetic attempt at the Blair Witch Project type of movie. The girls are skinny, trashy, foul-mouthed, tatooed, druggie looking that offer nothing to the human race. I guess there will be enough dumb like me that purchase crap like this on a whim without reading reviews that they will actually make money off of this tripe. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,This is very entertaining!,This is great TV series to watch. It has humor for all ages. I would highly recommend it to anyone!
4,Tree of Heaven,"Wonderful, it's just like the first part of Stairway to Heaven. Lee Wan is the perfect guy for the role, he's so cute...."
5,"Works well for my Digital Camera needs, I would buy more from Sony","I really like this battery and battery charger combo from Sony.I use these for my digital camera...and sometimes for a portable shaver.I haven't timed how long they last, but I can get a whole days worth of pictures on just 2 of these AA batteries.I am happy with my purchase."
3,Charger and batteries are getting really hot,I just want to share what I experienced with this item.I have bought this item from Amazone a week before. All the batteries I got was 2500 mAH which is different as per the product description. I have charged all the batteries which came with the charger together. It took almost 5 hrs and 45 minutes to charge completely. By the time both the charger and batteries were extremely hot. I have not tested with 1 or 2 batteries alone. I am not sure wheather this is a superqucik charger as like mentioned in the title.But the charger is light weight and easy to carry. Design is also good.I have given only 3 stars since I have not used this item much and also since it is getting really very hot.
2,Incorrect product description - can only charge two AA batteries at a time,"I bought this charger for my rechargeable AAA batteries, as the description and technical specifications clearly state:""charger handles 4 AA and 4 AAA batteries simultaneously""and""Charges four AA and AAA batteries at a time""Although this charger can charge four AA batteries at once, it can only charge TWO AAA batteries at the same time; the two center slots accept both AA and AAA but the outside slots accept only AA. And in case anyone thinks I may be a nimrod that doesn't know how to use the device, straight from the product manual itself:""A maximum of 2 AAA batteries can be charged in the center slots only."""
3,Change the product description,"""..The compact, lightweight charger handles 4 AA and 4 AAA batteries simultaneously..."" - that is just NOT true! And that is Amazon.com product description! Forget about charging 4 AAA and 4 AA simultaneously, it can not even charge 4 AAA together - max 2 of them. Only 2 other reviewers have reported this, so thought of making this clear.Also, the user manual mentions about batteries upto 2300mAh only. I have got the ""better together"" Sony batteries and they are 2500mAh. Now if this happens to be a timer based charger - as another reviewer has mentioned - then seems like I won't be able to use it charge them. Gotta call the sony folks."
5,great charger,"This is a review for the batteries - the charger is best I have owned so far and its quick in comparison to others.I take about 700 - 1000 photos a day (640x480)res. with a olympus sp-550uz.These sony batteries charge quicky (I bought the sony quick charger) and they will last you an entire day or more.Buy these batteries if you take a lot of photos, they are worth it.I bought these to replace a set of cheap ""power 2000"" rechargable batteries. (amazon sells these also, I got the ""power 2000"" batteries free and they were not even worth charging or using. They consitently died after about 150 photos.)"
1,Worst NiMH I have ever used,"I own this Sony battery/charger combo. All NiMh batteries self discharge but these are the worst I've ever encountered for self discharge. The storage capacity of these batteries also quickly degraded. The ""refresh"" feature of the charger did nothing to restore capacity. Replaced these batteries with generic NiMH (Powerex branded) and continued to use the Sony charger and the same digital camera - after more than 6 months of use there has been no evidence of the rapid self discharge and diminished storage capacity battery issues that I experienced with the Sony batteries. Do yourself a favor and avoid purchasing these batteries. Note, I gave this product 1 star only because the rating system did not allow me to give the product a zero star rating."
4,yeah they take six hours to charge...,but last a month in my wireless mouse and two weeks in my digital camera so all and all I think they are great for the money and the environment. Abolish alkalines!
1,sent unwanted item,I tried to cancel my order but they sent it instead. Now I have to bring it to the post office and pay to return it...no return labels?there should be.Joseph Xavier Glennon
3,I love her writing but,"While this story was quite good, I got so sick of Carson's character that I fast forwarded through his tirades."
2,Hoping it was better...,"I think this book had a great promise of suspense and romance but, unfortunately fell flat by the middle and died at the end.I think the author simply forgot to tell the story. It felt as though she was building up to bring us through the story and didn't know how to pull in all the pieces. I was disappointed towards the middle because I wanted to READ a GOOD book. The characters were beginning to annoy me through the middle. A little far fetched. I put the book down often which is unlike me. Once I am hooked on a book it doesn't leave my side. I always keep it with me in case I find a few moments to continue reading. I beleive she has talent but this book didn't showcase her well. Could have been so much better if she spent more time developing the plot and creating some mystery and excitement."
4,Excellent!,"As an Andrea Kane fan, I have to say this is one of her best novels of the contemporary, thriller style. I loved the characters of Sabrina and Dylan, her father Carson, her mother Gloria and all the characters who keep you guessing as to their involvement. It kept me turning pages till there were none left. The chemistry between Sabrina and Dylan was hot. And Sabrina is 27 years old in this novel, not 32 as a reviewer incorrectly posted. Since this is fiction, you can believe that she was the president of her own company. There are many women who have achieved early and this is definately feasible. Of course, it doesn't hurt to believe that a young woman could be so successful. I give credit to Kane for creating such well rounded characters with a great plot. If you like Kane's earlier works, you will like this one just as much. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that I found it difficult to believe who the culprit really was, after revealed."
1,Her voice is gone,"This was old, uninspired, derivative stuff, but the most painful thing is that all the life and pizazz has departed from LR's voice. I just sounds like two middle aged women groaning. I have already tossed the CD"
1,It doesn't fit my standard-size crib,"The crib I have bought is the standard size. Another crib set I bought from other place fits well. But the bumper in this crib set is too short in each side and the ruffle can't be put on, either. I have to return it."
3,Brat Pack CD,"The best song in this CD for me is ""Everytime The Rain Starts To Fall"" a simple ballad. I love this song from the first time I heard it years ago. That was the reason I bought this CD as I've lost my old copy.Other songs are basically the typical 90s pop rock. You really have to be a hard-core pop fan to enjoy the album."
2,French Country,"This album seems like the equivalent of an American country one, mixed with some folk music. If you like country music and folk music, and want to listen to something different this is for you. I don't like country music or folk music so, I didn't like the songs."
1,This Product is NO GOOD,"The 1st time using was a drag, one worked and the rest did Not. So I gave them to my 2 year old sister that is what they are good for same with the CDS"
4,A brief good read,"Only 48 pages long (including index), I thought it was clear, concise and objective. Nothing of ""In my opinion"" about it. Although there were no photographs (only drawings), if the other History's Mysteries books are like this one then I can't wait to read them too."
1,"Fan blades cracked, PermWick began to rot","After one season of use, it got very noisy. The plastic fan blades developed several cracks and were rubbing against the fan housing. Then the blades flew apart.I wanted a humidifier like my father has; an old belt type that has run for years. A plastic belt netting rotates through the water and past a large fan. But I cannot find those any more.Wicks rot after a season, requiring replacement. So I was happy to see that this had a wick made of metal, over which water is pumped. However, part of the so called PermaWick rotted away after one season.A permanent wick is a good idea, but inferior materials sabotaged it. Hunter replaced the entire unit free; we'll see if it lasts."
2,works great but for only one season,I've owned 4 hunter humidifiers. All are the same type but 2 different models. This is a newer model so I thought they may have solved the problem I have had but they did not. After a season the motor freezes up and you call Hunter and they send you a new one. I took one apart and found that salt builds up in the motor till it will no longer turn. I have a water softener which is the source of the salt. If you have hard water the result may be the same. If it wasn't for that I'd give it a 5 star because the filters last forever and on the low speed it's fairly quiet. I run it on high when no one is in the room. I run it constantly during the winter.
5,Amazing,"How is it that music so fresh, so inventive, and so complex and simple all at once goes almost unnoticed for so long! If CDs wore out the way LPs did, I would have to be buying this set again to replace my worn out versions! Anyone who appreciates Monk and Powell will treasure this set. Guaranteed."
5,Simply delicious vegan delights!,"I picked this book up about 6 years ago. I am a vegan and enjoy making veggie sushi and other Japanese dishes. This book is really great. I make one recipe from it about twice a month -- it's called tofu and braised leeks, I think. Anyhow, it's great. My wife and son love that one! The best thing about the recipes is that they are really simple and require few ingredients. I highly recommend it!"
2,Absolute Cheese,I have been interested in pole dancing for a number of years and have taken classes sporadically here and there. I really thought this video might be an instructional demonstration on the art of not only pole dancing but embracing sensuality and sexuality as well. What a waste of time. Poorly shot and not at all worth the price. I watched a part of it and threw it away.
2,eh,"if you are already a stripper this is for you. if you are looking for a fun sexy workout then skpit it. i have only mnade it through 1st 2 dvds and idk if its worth my time to finish watching the 3rd. there is a few moves that are explained in the 2nd vid but not anything to workout too or learn any rutine. waste of $27. guess you live and learnalso the 1st dvd is more of a 'watch girls give guys lap dances', doesnt teach anything about doing lapdance for fun or as exercise."
5,Great value,Was going to buy the pole dancing and the carmen single but saw this set and very happy with it thanks.
4,"LIGHTWEIGHT, SILLY AND MARVELOUSLY MOCKING!","If he can make it there, he can make it anywhere. But Alexander Chancellor did not make it in New York, N.Y. -- the British writer was hired in 1995 by then-""New Yorker"" Big Cheese Tina Brown to edit the magazine's mythical ""Talk of the Town"" section, and he failed. Miserably. His book -- the latest to join the rather long list of tomes ""celebrating"" the fabled magazine's 75th anniversary -- dishes as much dirt as Renata Adler's ""Gone: The Last Days of 'The New Yorker'"" (the best of the bunch), but Chancellor's Brit wit keeps them tamer -- with himself often the brunt of the jokes. He admits Brown had ""her blind spots"" and that ""maybe appointing me had been one of them."" Largely lightweight, sometimes silly, marvelously mocking."
4,"This is an intelligent, intimate journey to campuses .","I received this book as a Christmas gift,and the purchaser advised she had some difficulty finding it on shelves in her local bookstores. I am so-o-oglad she did. This guide allowed me tovisit with young women who made the adjustments I anticipate making. Theirchoices will strengthen my resolve whenthe time comes. I feel more prepared now for the college interview procedure,and the decision-making process. Thankyou Ms. Page and contributors."
3,Opposite recommendations for boys or girls-who is right?,Dr. Whelan recommends the opposite course of action (having intercourse before ovulation) for a boy than other experts. Why isn't more research done in this area? How can we tell what the correct theory and practice is to increase the chances of one sex or the other?
4,Boy or Girl?,"My first child was a girl and very happy we were, however, I debated about having another child. A couple of years later the thought of having another child amerged so I purchased this book in 1997 with the thought of potentially increasing my chances of having a boy. This book does just that, supports the potential increase in chance of the preferred sex, while being honest at the same time. Our next child happened to be a boy. I can't say definitively it was the author's information or gods will. I'm currently reading it again."
4,Worked for us!,"While the most of the book is not very useful, her technique worked for us. After two boys, we wanted our third and final child to be a girl. After reading the book, I realized why I have two boys so we used the girl method and it worked."
3,GOOD,The information that you read here is much like other books on this issue and doesn't really give you a reason to buy it over other books dealing with the same issues.
4,Bought for a Gift,"I gave this as a gift, and they loved it. Never had any complaints. Samsumng is a good brand, especially for computer monitors and HDTVs."
4,"Excellent price, good performances, some track labeling issues","For the price, great for those interested in classic flamenco guitar. Sabicas, Nino Ricardo, and the others were true flamenco maestros.Something I noticed, though, (which is not Amazon's fault, I think) but must be the record company's, is that the Sabicas tracks are probably mislabeled. Based on my understanding of the flamenco forms, the 'compases', the tracks are probably shown out of order. Listening to the pieces, the first track is an alegria, the second a buleria, the third a farruca, the fourth a zapateado (and I have a DVD where Sabicas is playing this and it is labeled as being a zapateado), and the fifth a taranta, so actual ordering of the tracks should probably read:Alegrias 'Salero Gaditano' - SabicasBulerias 'Con Un Clavel' - SabicasFarruca 'El Albacin' - SabicasZapateado - SabicasTaranta 'Camino De Linares' - SabicasI think the ordering for the non-Sabicas tracks is okay."
3,A decent knife for the price,This is not a bad knife. My only complaint is that with almost every Buck knife I've ever owned they tend to have really brittle blades. If you pry or twist too much on this blade you will chip it. The extra hard steel (which is what makes them brittle) also makes the hard to sharpen. The only real effective tool I've found for sharpening a Buck knife is a diamond stone. They are pretty sharp out of the box and as long as you don't chip the blade they hold an edge better than many other knifes.
3,Treads too lightly,"Interesting documentary about a truly exceptional man and the deep dissatisfaction and psychological devastation that seemed to go hand-in-hand with his genius. Treads too lightly around the more troubling aspects of his personality, however."
3,Billie for the Interested,"Travelling back in time to focus on a outstanding musician that you like is very different from following a current one as you have a host of albums to dig into alongside another vast collection of best ofs. Billie Holiday is splendid voice and this in an interesting album for those who want to chronicle through her times as a singer. However, I reckon that there are compilations that better serve to introduce Billie more thoroughly. This one is ineed a gem for the avid listener, but not satisfactory for the casualy interested."
3,Gleaming of Billie,"My disk seemed flawed with dead spots, but after listening and reading the printed material I came to realize that this is all that was left of these recordings. I gave it 3 because it reflects on the way it was with Billie, and not the sugar coated versions we are more accustom to be presented. Billie could be quite difficult to work with, according to material printed."
4,fun fun fun,What a fun album. Sounds like early erasure yazoo etc. If you like fun bubbly synth get it.
5,A Great Book!,"Living in the area where Charlie grew up, it is quite obvious that the author did thorough research. The descriptions are quite amazing! My husband and I know exactly where the roads and landmarks are located to this day. A great story for readers of all ages to appreciate relationships and our own journey through life."
2,Jams up my reader,unhappy because my reader wouldn't open up after trying to read one with a sticker on it.I gave up and bought a $99 Canon printer that prints labels. Way cool printer
4,Wonderful,I'm a stay-at-home dad who has a lot to learn when it comes to patience and compassion. This book offers the insight that I've been looking for.
5,"Buddhist or Not! Moms, Dads, Teachers or anyone who has/loves children! MUST READ!","Buddhist, searching, Christian, Catholic..it doesn't matter what you are, this book fits in anywhere, and is amazing for helping one develop the art of being in the present and mindfulness. I love the way she writes, I love her personal stories. I cried and laughed, reread and probably highlighted more of this book than any other book I own She hits home on so many things for me. I feel like I am a better person, wife and mother because of this book. It's almost like a bible.Everyone always says ""They grow up so fast"", and her book inspired how important it is to be in the moment with my son because he is only going to be this small, and this way for such a short while, I don't want to miss a thing. I reflect on her insight when my son is inconsolable, or wakes several times in the night to feed. It brings me back."
4,Very pleased with results,"I purchased this c.d for my mother who is a huge fan of Maurette Brown Clark and I must say that the album is simply fantastic. She has such a soulful, warm-hearted sound and her singing seems so effortless. The songs are very inspirational and I do believe that a few of the songs on the album were written by her. If you're looking for a GREAT gospel album, I highly recommend this one! I'm definately glad I purchased the album through amazon because it was less expensive than a store price. Thanks!"
5,Her music ministry just gets better and better,"I have been a support of Maurette Brown Clark's music ministry since her first album. I've seen her minister live a few times and she was the guest soloist in the Women's Day Choir for my church years ago.This new album is truly annointed. There is a great combination of true praise and true worship music from this anointed psalmist. She is a gifted musician and songwriter. You can hear her passion for the Lord and leading people to him in her songs. My faves are ""I Have Decided to Follow Jesus"" (classic Maurette improvisation on the end), ""I Am What God Says I Am,"" which is led by her daughter Jada Simone Clark. It shows you that God can use young people at any age. The lyrics are simple, but powerful reminders of Who We Are and Whose We Are. Finally, Sovreign God will lead you to a new place of worship! GREAT JOB MAURETTE! Continued blessings on your upcoming tour and your next musical effort!"
1,Knock off,"The product came quickly, but when I first opened it,I notice the lid was white and not the normal Donna Karan lid. I used the product and knew it was not the normal scent.I have used Donna Karan for years. I went to a department store and used their Donna Karan and compared. I had a knock off and was angry! I emailed the Company and received a quick response. My money was returned within a few days, but I would not order from them again..."
3,Only for hardcore Goines fans.,"This is a biography of Donald Goines, who wrote a lot of sleazy ghetto fiction books. The only book of his that I have read is Dopefiend, which is good, but is also one of the most depressing books I have ever read. But anyway about Low Road, its not that its bad but this is very incomplete. I really didn't feel like I knew that much about Goines except he was a junkie, he was a convict, he was a criminal, he was murdered. There is a lot of filler in this book too where the author goes into general history of the times that Goines lived. I'd only recomend this to people who are really into Goines. If you only have a casual interest in Goines this book really isn't worth your time."
5,Essential For Any Fan,"Love the character of The Joker? Want detailed information on his long-lasting career in comic books? Want stories from various era's of his existence, ranging from the oldest to the more recent (oldest being 1940's and more recent being 1980's, by the way)? Well, instead of rushing to this year's Batman convention to chit-chat with a fellow devoted Joker-nerd, and instead of buying dozens of separate comic books, pick up The Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told. It's all you need! With some commentaries by the writers, plus a superb collection of fully illustrated comic book stories (which are the majority of the book), this is the perfect buy. A must-own!"
4,Lanzar Amp,"Works well... be sure to use the correct impedance matching or else it will get hot.. Works better when using in the 2 channel mode... Gets a little hotter when bridged. It has thermal protection, so it will trip if it gets to hot. Haven't reached the max output yet, because I am using one amp for both mids and base and I don't have a crossover. I have noticed that the base boost don't respond too well in that either you have a full base boost or none... good cheap amp overall."
3,Bit of a struggle to like this one,"First of all, I'm a big, big fan of John Hiatt. I have all of his albums. This one gets off to a cracking start - Real Fine Love is one of Hiatt's best ever songs - but failsto live up to that early promise (apart from Rock Back Billy). So what's wrong with it? Well, I think it's a combination of the production and his voice. The production, and the arrangements, are rather ordinary, mostly. And Hiatt's voice on this sounds so tight it's almost painful to listen to. No, I was disappointed from the start with this and I still am. There are plently of other great Hiatt albums to spend your money on."
5,helping to heal,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends WHERE DOES A MOM'S LOVE GO? for those children who have suffered the loss of their Moms. It's touching & dreamy, funny & achingly joyful.For everyone faced with telling their little ones the sad truth, & coping with the fear, & always for remembering.As with all Patti Lynn Bongiorno's books, WHERE DOES A MOM'S LOVE GO? is to be treasured."
2,Would not buy these again...,"I will start of my saying that I LOVE the Playtex sippy cups and those are the only ones that my daughter uses. I am only giving these 2 stars however because they are the cheapest looking sippy cups that I have ever seen from Playtex. The sippy cup itself does what it is supposed to do but I bought these because they were girly and said Disney Princess... The Disney Princesses have almost all washed or scrapped off. Even before that started to happen, the Princesses are nasty. It looks like the image was just slapped on the cup without worrying about the placement of the sticker. The Princesses are printed on the outside sleeve of the sippy cup instead of the inside where perhaps the images would have more protection... I am still using these cups but only in our house."
3,Good Selections Bad CD!,"I bought this CD because of its great song selections,but the bad thing about this CD is the CD itself I returned it twice because of factory defect on the following tracks 6,7,8.The sad thing too, is Track 5...the selection is not the song ""Love Story"" but a different song.This is a risky CD you don't want to keep returning the defective one over and over again."
4,enjoyable,I very much enjoyed all 3 books that I bought for my kindle. They are fun. Maybe you have to be a LOL to enjoy - have to read them to understand what a LOL means.
5,On The Run,"This is the third book in an ""Ivy Malone Mystery"" series. I have also read Books 1,2,and 4 about this LOL, ( Little Old Lady,) and have been highly entertained. In ""On The Run"", Ivy manages to stumble into another murder mystery. The carry over of the characters in the first book and the addition of new characters makes reading about her insatiable curiosity a fun read . All the characters are well developed and lead Ivy into some dangerous situations. How she manages to out run the danger and find the culprit is lively, humorous and brings her to a satisfactory conclusion. I would recommend all four of the books in the series for a light, humorous story about and older lady who's curiosity gets her into a lot of trouble."
3,Drinking album,"They have this album on the jukebox at the Dog House in Washington Township NJ and it sounds really good there. Several of the sonbgs of Pay The Devil make you want to take a seat at the bar and order two Southern Comforts and two Cherry Cokes. Van Morrison proves here that he cam teach Nashville a thing or two about what country music should sound like in this new century. No schmaltz, vocals should be straightfoward and belched out with aplomb. Some people think Van is a little bit of a hermit; this album shows you just how wrong these people are. Van Morrison shows us instead that he is conscious of his mystic canon of work and we may as well live at a truck stop if we really expect him to re-produce the mythos of his 80s albums onstage."
2,Just an odd movie.,"I had seen positive reviews on other websites, and was glad to have finally been able to find the movie for streaming. I was disappointed. Very strange storyline, hard to follow."
1,picture show different brand,"was order this battery was expecting something different , not some chinese products whit no name on,package was cheapCR1620 3V Lithium Cell"
5,great way to handle the topic of prejudice and intrigueing who done it.,"This is the first I read the book but have seen the movie and the series. Mr. Ball did a great job on keeping the suspense going, and dealing with all the feelings. This book is so well put together, not trashy, vengeful just dealing with people. I really enjoyed the quiet on the mark dealings of clues and people."
5,it's a great c.d. of buddy's well known charts,"because i am a buddy homer, i can't recommend this enough! love for sale and greensleeves are two of my more favorite charts on this c.d. channel one and west side story are wonderful. it's a great begginning c.d. for those who are just starting to like buddy."
4,Hallelujah Trail,"This was a good movie which I enjoyed. I am a Native American living in the area where it was filmed, so I have a connection with this movie."
2,Janelso,"A great movie, and a classic comedy. I saw this in the theaters when it was new, enjoyed it then and now. My only complaint is that the the the picture quality is extremely bad, with obvious pixilation. When the camera pans the picture is nearly unwatchable. Diagonal lines turn into stair stepped pixels that remind me of old DOS computer graphics. This is the worst example of DVD movies that I have ever seen."
1,Terrible DVD Transfer,"MGM has made the decision to offer this presentation of Hallelujah Trail on one side (two layers) of a DVD disc, requiring more compression of the video image than we normally see on higher quality DVD's. This has resulted in a DVD that is positively painful to watch due to digital artifacts. MGM should be embarrased about releaseing such an inferior product."
1,Very Unsatisfactory,"After hours upon hours of trying to get this cable and software to work, It eventually allowed me about an hour of connected time, and then never worked again. My opinion is to stick with the OEM cable. The extra money's worth paying to avoid the headache."
1,Nokia DKU-5...it's terrible.,"I bought but it dont work fine. The software its a mess. If you will buy, forget...or cried after."
2,New science not so new,"This book, although copywrited in 2002, is already outdated. Regrettably, it also spends an inordinate number of pages touting commercial jury consulting firms, rather than providing theory, application or even advice on jury selection."
5,This is the place to start.,"Forget all you know about music. Give Shuffletown a listen, and you will restructure your outlook. This album not only builds a mood, but also a community full of Average-Joes (no pun intended), villiage idiots, garden poets, and, of course, the ultimate Southern griot."
2,Wow,"This movie is not at all what I was expecting.I bought it because it stars Michelle Rodriguez, one of my favorite actresses. I didn't expect much of it, but when it ended, I was still pretty irritated. Reason being, the 'action' wasn't over, and the screen faded to black as the credits appeared.It is very likely that I will sell this movie in the near future as I doubt I'll view it again . . ."
2,Wes Craven is toying around,"Really kind of disappointed with Craven's work in the last several years, and this movie is just more proof of that feeling. With ""The Breed"" he does bring out some scary options for the typical characters he has. In this movie they are of course just a bunch of college students on some vacation getaway on an island that formerly housed some secret government test facility that experimented with dogs.It has the usual problem presented which has the youths trying to figure out a plan of escape as well as at times, a plan of attack. In the end I just felt like this movie was sub standard slash that did not have enough staying power to make me feel like it had any value to be viewed again. Craven needs to concentrate on getting more intricate scripts that are followed up by some better actors, but that costs more money so I am not expecting anything spectacular from him anytime soon."
1,returned it as soon as it arrived,"I ordered two of these and returned them the day they arrived. If you are ordering this product make sure you know what you are getting. This is an ""MP3"" player, not an MP3 player. It doesn't play real music. You can organize 100 songs that are preloaded onto the music player to make play lists. I should have known it was too good to be true with the price. Cute for a toddler who isn't yet interested in ""real"" music."
2,returning item,"We ordered one each for our son and daughter. They are not what we were expecting. No lyrics to the songs just music. We are returning them and will shop for items like this in a store so we can have a better idea of what we are getting. I do have to say the shipping was very fast, hopefully the processing on the return will be just as fast."
4,Goin' Up and Away,"Freddie Hubbard's second set as a leader for Blue Note picks up where his first, Open Sesame, left off with lots of fine, supercharged hard bop.Hubbard's cast of foils are refined on this outing, though, with only pianist McCoy Tyner holding over. Tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, a Blue Note stablemate, brings not only a pair of compositions but some superlative blowing. The two horn men definitely bring out the best in each other here.Tyner's finest moment can be found on the balled ""I Wish I Knew"", where he contributes some of the most lyrical playing of the set. The inimitable engine room of Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums round out the quintet.Blue Note's output of this era is so consistently strong it is very easy to take individual titles for granted. This one merits multiple listens."
3,"Slightly disappointing, less power than the regular Airzooka","We own both a regular Airzooka and this Megazooka. I was surprised to find out that the Megazooka doesn't have any more power than the regular Airzooka: the diaphragm is in the same location and the same size for both toys. The additional size of the Megazooka is to accommodate the trigger mechanism. Incidentally, the trigger mechanism does not pull the diaphragm back all of the way, so the full power of the Megazooka cannot be realized with the trigger. However, the back panel can be removed such that the diaphragm can be pulled back all of the way (but then the trigger no longer works; you pull the diaphragm back manually). Bottom line: if you're looking for raw power, get the regular Airzooka. It's lighter, easier to handle, and packs an equal punch to the Megazooka. If you have small (grade school) kids, the trigger mechanism of the Megazooka makes it easier to handle."
2,General information in a poor quality print.,"Having bought the Pontiac Firebird guide a few months earlier, I had high expectations on this book. I got it hoping it wouls help me with my Pathfinder. From the beggining I knew this book was meant for the US and Canada versions of the car. My car version is the Japanese.I tried looking for info on the Limited Slip Differential system, and didn't find anything. I got some info on brakes, but the pictures are so poorly printed, so I rather serviced them all on my own."
4,"Good toaster for the price, and it looks good also...","We've been using this toaster for over a month now, and it has performed very well. It does indeed accept half bagels to thin bread without a problem, and the toasting seems to be uniform. The crumb trays work fine and the finish is very nice. If you want a toaster that will accept slices of bread larger in dimension than a typical square commercial loaf, you might want to look elsewhere because the slots are not sized to accept larger bread slices without some of the slice sticking out the top. But we make do for large slices by flipping the bread upside down and re-toasting, so there is a work-around. If the controls on the front would have been a little better marked, I would have gone 5 stars. But we are very happy with the purchase."
5,Melanie : She is SO FINE!!!,"The price is a real bargain for so many great songs by one of the greatest singer/songwriters that ever came out of Woodstock. This CD showcases a wide range of songs that are from years ago along with brand new songs. The sound quality is superb and while the songs were recorded in the studio, there is a live feeling to most of them that is wonderfully vibrant. Melanie puts her all into these tracks and the results make this album a definite ""must have"". If you are unfamiliar with Melanie, this is an excellent introduction. All of the songs are current recordings and time has not diminished the amazing voice that Melanie has. She can sing a tender ballad and belt out a rock song. She crosses genres with ease. ""Solo Powered"" is a wonderful album. It is most definitely worth having. You will not regret buying this one."
5,Stride Rite quality for boys or girls,"Stride Rite's Austin athletic shoe is a well made and versatile shoe.The quality of the leather is nice, and the stitching is strong throughout the shoe. It has a heavy dute sole that should wear well for quite a while, even for an active child.The shoe itself is heavy, not like an ultra light sneaker (which most kids probably don't wear anyway).Note - there is little padding on the inside of the shoe, which may or may not make a difference depending on your child's foot.This shoe comes in W & XW sizes.Another great thing about this shoe is that it's gender neutral, so a boy or girl could wear it.I love Stride Rite's quality and versatility in the Austin athletic shoe.I won't buy this style again, because honestly, I ordered one in every size. With the sales/discounts it was about $13 per pair, and I can easily sell used pairs for this much at the consignment shop."
5,school shoes,They are a little big but that is o.k. he will use them later on. I like the fact that they are a solid color which is the school requirement. Great quality!
5,"An excellent documentary on Rastafari, A1+++++++++++",I personally loved this documentary. For the first time we get to see a high quality documentary take us inside a Rasta Camp and interview the founder Dermot Fagan who is a great character.A good all round view of Rastafari in the 21st century.This film shows us that not all Rasta's have the same beliefs and not all believe that Haile Selassie is God or that repatriation means moving to Africa but for many it's a place in ones mind. The film helps to dismiss many of the rumours about Rastafari and speaks to important members of different houses of Rastafari.Can reccomend....
5,great seller willing to work with you.,i purchased this ball it has a very durable and great quality ball. I had no problems with mine. Besides the customer service with the ball is wonderful. had no trouble putting mine together.
4,This stove heats!!!,"I bought this stove as a replacement for a cheaper one I use to have. THis stove Heats. I mean heats. It works well, I would, however advise you about a fresh air intake for it from outside. It draws good and have had little problems with it except the glass wont stay clean as advertised. Its not a big thing for me. I just use a razor scraper and its good to go again. Also to . Plan on putting a clean out slip collar on the stove pipe. cause this stove has a smoke void in the top that can build up with creosote. At present, my stove is difficult to clean out because there is not clear access to the smoke exhaust area in the top of the stove so watch your creosote flake crumbs they fall down inside the stove on a flat plate just 4 inches from the pipe flange and could stack up causing a close off of the smoke stack. It heats my 1200 sf pretty well. I think its rated for over 2000 sf space. Happy Heating."
1,Does not work well,"This purifier does not pick up any odors, such as smoke or animal hair as it purports and you are forced to buy the filters on line. I am not satisfied with this product at all."
5,hunter room cleaner,"had one just like it before,so was replacing that one use in my office and does a great job, for the price,you wont find a one"
3,OK but noisy.,So far this air purifier seems to work fine but not as well as one I bought 15 years ago. I also am sure it was not new but a return since the box was all taped together and the plastic cover over the carbon filter was already removed. I expect better from Amazon and the companies they do business with.
1,"As ""scientific"" as astrology","Co-editor and author Michael Behe claims that Intelligent Design is a scientific theory, by his own definition of ""scientific"".However, under oath on the witness stand in Kitzmiller v. Dover (2005), Behe admitted that by his definition, ASTROLOGY is also a ""scientific theory"".So why pay for this book, when you could turn to your newspaper's horoscopes and get something just as ""scientific"" at a much lower price?No-one can serve two masters, and the contributors to this tome chose the side of religion against the side of science."
3,Good to hold the headset,"If making sure that the headset does not pop out of the pouch is your main factor then I would give it 5 stars, however, if looks or worksmanship, quality of finishing is what you are looking at apart from its basic functionality then I would say need to look at other products. The clip on the one I got does not fit straight on the magnet, it is somewhat angular which is because of faulty stiching of the clip at the back."
1,"Condescending, little useful info, and woefully out of date.","The only things that were useful to me in this book were the maps, and even they were out of date. To read this book (written long ago in 1998), you'd think that Bulgaria was a.) boring, b.) dangerous, and c.) miserable. Bulgaria, as I discovered on a trip this summer, is none of the above: it is beautiful, warm, fascinating and an incredible amount of fun. Blue Guide should really go out of its way to update this guide to reflect Bulgaria as it truly is now: much more forward thinking, much more westernized, and very tourist friendly, with a ton of fascinating and (still) affordable things to do and to see. Spend your money on a better, recent guide."
1,Don't consider this product,"Hoping that I'd find a bargain in purchasing this item, I was sensationally disappointed by its performance on both Mac OS X Tiger and Windows Vista. It seems that this thing was made from three separate pieces that were essentially glued together. So when you are writing from the top section to the mid section, your writings or drawings will be choppy when rendered on the screen. Same goes for writing from the mid section to the lower section. I lost patience in trying to figure out what in the world was going on with this device for a day and promptly returned it right in the box. I'll be purchasing that ""other tablet"" which no one seems to have a problem with, though not at the bargain prices. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Good...but not enough solo,"I really wanted to hear more Nat soloing--before he became the star vocalist. He was an extremely good jazz pianist...and that's why he swung in singing. Maybe those soloist track just do not exist. But, what's here is good."
3,Mo Drama Fo Yo Mama!,"Cubicles is a novel that has a great premise: drama in the workplace. The book focuses on three women at the Meridian Southwest phone company: Faulkner, an ambitious young manager; Joyce, her hard-nosed, power hungry boss; and Margaret, the motherly employee who has nurtured both women as she watched them rise to power -- while standing still herself. What I enjoyed about the novel is that as women, Faulkner, Joyce and Margaret each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and strive to accomplish their own goals. Camika Spencer illustrates that these ladies have personal lives outside the workplace, which definitely have an effect on their workplace demeanor. Faulkner appears to be a pushover; Joyce is battling demons from her past; and Margaret has a lazy, self-absorbed daughter. Although the book can be a little tedious at times and the dialogue a little stilted, Cubicles is definitely an excellent take on workplace fiction."
2,Watch the 4 stars,"Barry Callen works for the author. Take his review with a big grain of salt. This book is basic, dry and uninspiring."
3,"Wait five years, maybe ten.","In the age of hyper-intense whiny media coverage, anyone who thinks Task Force 20/121 or similar operations will be written about in a current and informative manner is pretty much deluded.While this is a nice start point for someone who never heard of the concept of special operations in a joint warfighting context, I would wait if you want hard specifics on what the guys in the commercial-purchase LBV's and the hockey helmets were up to."
3,Good for Beginners,"I expected a little more and was mildly disappointed. This book provided the occasional snippet of new info on special ops in Iraq and little new info on special forces in total. There was some exciting new info on the UK's SBS in Iraq as well as US's Gray Fox unit. Also a lot of new detail on Delta Force's selection process. I was very disappointed when the author seems to confuse the US Navy's Special Boat Squadron with the UK's Special Boat Service; specifically, he illustrates the unit crest for the UK unit at the mention of either unit (p.113). Some of his prose was hard to figure out. I've read a lot of these special ops books and I still recommend E. Haney's Delta Force and C. Pfarrer's Warrior Soul as the most entertaining and informative."
2,Where is it???,I ordered this item over 3 or 4 months ago and still have not received it. So much for being warm this winter.
5,Even better than I thought,"I wanted a book that would both help me gain basic insight in Chinese history and entertain me on my daily commute, and Gascoigne's Dynasties of China have more than fulfilled my expectations. It is thoughtfully written, highly readable and full of interesting facts. The book creates a coherent image of the Chinese civilization and explains well all topics it touches.I also highly appreciete all the citations (mostly from primary sources), index (which contains both pinyin and the ""traditional"" transcription of Chinese names) and, a short timetable and a map. These will make the book even more valuable for future reference. Color photos are a nice bonus.I'm a bit careful about writing overly positive reviews, but this may very well be the best book on history I have read."
3,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc sank the rating","A great book but with many, many, and not all corrected in the extensive, yet not definitive, errata list. Make sure you contact the editor for it. I mean, a table of content with page references that don't match, whole chunk of text missing at the very beginning of chapter 14, and then missing words (easy to spot, they left a blank! And I have not read it from cover to cover yet as this turned me off, so who knows what else got missed. And if you are a student, wait until you try to use a formula that has not been printed correctly. Great author, great text, lousy editing and printing. Maybe wait for the fourth edition?"
5,A Great Collaboration,"The highlight of this album for me is Nancy Wilson's duet with pianist Joe Zawinul on The Masquerade is Over. The emotional ending is something I don't think she could recapture if she tried. The instrumental tracks are solid, traditional jazz. The vocal tracks, which are the first 7 tracks on the cd, rate as legitimate jazz collaborations. She shows off her tremendous rhythmic agility, crisp articulation at any tempo and beauteous piercing tone, easily holding her own among some of the most respected jazz musicians of the time. There's none of the operatic flab of Sarah Vaughan, the cornball phrasing of Ella Fitzgerald or obvious vocal limitations of Billie Holiday."
4,Action and affability in the bayous,"It's not hard to see why readers like Crais' work -- his novels have an engaging readability about them, and this is no exception. The private detective with the funny name, Elvis Cole, saunters into the assignment of discovering an adopted TV star's birth parents and soon finds himself knee-deep in the swamps of Louisiana battling people smugglers of a very violent nature.As the action turns darker, Cole makes the transition from a wise-cracking sleuth to a hard-nosed crime fighter as he stands between the innocent or unintentionally guilty and a mass of vicious and greedy gangsters.The whole effect is of James Lee Burke in a sunny mood, a novel which keeps you turning the pages without sinking you completely into the murkiest depths of the human condition. Pacey, fun and very readable indeed."
2,"Oh Well, At Least I Learned What Boudin Is....","Other than being introduced to that Cajun delicacy, this book was pretty much a waste of time. The plot started off okay but just kept getting weaker and weaker and then totally bombed at the end. The ending was just too contrived. The characters, mostly, didn't seem real. The romance seemed unrealistic. Even the setting -- not far from James Lee Burke bayou country -- lacked Burke's superior narration and authentic feel. Crais should have ceded Lousiana to Burke and stayed home in L.A. Crais' books seem to be very good or, well, not so good. Sadly, this one falls into the latter category. He's a much better writer than this."
4,VOODOO RIVER,THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO READ UNTIL YOU FINISH IT. NO SETTING IT DOWNAND COMING BACK TO IT LATER.
2,The Second Half was Tired and Cliched,"I've read most of the Elvis Cole series, and this is by far one of the worst ones. This book has the feel of two different novels pasted together. The first half is very intriguing, where Elvis has to search for a Television star's biological parents. Elvis searches Louisiana and comes up with even more mysteries and secrets, making it interesting and a page turner. I almost felt the anxiety and the hot muggy air when I read the first half.Then, all of a sudden, a horrible travesty of a book breaks out. Suddenly, Elvis somehow becomes involved in multi mob-boss fighting and immigration issues involving government stings, racial tensions from long ago, and horribly over-sentimental goals. The fluidity of the book is lost. The motivations and character involvement's are convoluted at best. Compared to the first half of the book, the second half is pure garbage.Crais took a good book and sabotaged it."
4,Sent quickly. Saves energy. Good product.,Sent quickly. Saves energy. Recycles heat. Good product. Would be better with a finer screen.
2,"Nice, but not portable","The wireless mouse is nice, however I was looking for something more portable. The USB device that plugs into the computer is almost as large as the mouse itself effectively doubling what I have to carry. I would have appreciated it if the advertisement was a little more clear about all of the parts so that I could have purchased a different model."
3,I don't know whether it works,I can't tell whether it works because I consume produce before it goes bad. The strawberries get moldy fairly quickly but they were probably old when I bought them. I am extremely new to the fresh vegetable world and since I bought this disc I started shopping every couple of days rather than buying lots of stuff at the same time.
2,"Love the idea, still not sure it works",I bought these because I am a fan of the produce storage bags which have worked great with bananas and lettuce. I haven't noticed a real difference with this disk. I think I'll stick with the bags.
1,Do not buy,"The pants were comfortable, plenty of room in the seat but suddenly after wearing them a few times the seat just rips horizontally. I could understand if the seam popped but no, just a straight line across your rear explodes open when you sit down."
3,Great pants,"Great quality and comfort. The Navy Blue seems very dark, almost like a midnight blue. Can hardly see the difference between black and ""navy""."
2,Amazon Goofed,"Considering the millions of items Amazon offers its customers, the company can be proud of its extraordinary efficiency and accuracy. However, the Amazon description is not for this DVD, which I purchased some time ago. This is a DVD of an old, non-enhanced kinescope of a show filmed by the USO to be distributed to the troops in the 1950s. As one reviewer commented, Bing sings White Christmas and introduces the show, but it's not a Christmas show. There are film clips of 50 or more stars doing one song or comedy bit each. It's interesting to see them, and some talented newcomers are also featured. Miyoshi Umeki, for instance, sings a beautiful ballad. I would like to get the retrospective Crosby special hosted by Kathryn Crosby and Gene Kelly, which is the DVD described by Amazon, even though, as one reviewer noted, the excerpts are short and too often marred by voice-over narration. Finally, some of these reviews are for ""White Christmas,"" starring Crosby and Danny Kaye."
4,Put this fire out.,"If it was possible to wear a groove into a CD, the spot where ""Put this fire out"" would be visibly worn into the CD. All of Toni's CD's are ""the best"" at the right moment, it just depends on what ""space"" you are in during that moment. I look forward to anything she conceives."
1,Too Tedious of a read,"Couldn't wait for it to end....it was pure drudgery for me...but it was Tolstoy, right? :)All the Russian names were confusing, and they changed what they called each other....my goodness.The love story was good, but all the detail about Russian life in the wheat fields and such was just too much for me.I made my way through it, but it wasn't a pleasurable read...well a few parts weren't bad, but for the most part, I didn't like it."
5,It's a classic for a reason!,"Don't be frightened by the Russian setting, or the fact that it's written by the very famous and well-studied literary great Leo Tolstoy. In fact, this beautiful novel reads like a page-turning historical romance. Go ahead, take it to the beach and enjoy!"
1,Penguin Publishing's contempt for Kindle and libraries,"Having been notified by DigitalLibrary NJ that my copy of Anna Karenina was ready to be checked out, I went through all the clicks and was stopped cold by Amazon's note that the publisher would not permit direct downloads to Kindle and that I would have to download this LONG book onto my computer and then transfer it to my Kindle. WTF? Can anyone shed any light on why publishers such as Penguin are permitted to actively show their contempt for libraries and the millions of people who enjoy borrowing a book using modern electronic methods by making the process so ponderous?"
3,good read if you have a year to kill,"I love to read, but I hate to read books where there is so much unecessary dialogue. The first seven parts of the book were pretty good. I am totally confused about the direction the book took in part eight. This could have been a great book in about 400 pages. It still is a worthy read at 800 pages."
1,boring,"I love classic novels. Some of my favorites: Gone with the wind/The catcher in the rye/Huck Finn/The Iliad..I adore Shakespeare... this book was B-O-R-I-N-G!!! I stopped reading at 400 pages. I am someone that almost never stops reading books. I couldn't stand it any longer. I don't mind the parts the were actually about Anna and human relationships. I could not stand all of the boring Russian politic talk or Levin and his boring farming or hunting talk. AHH! I do not recommend this book. If I truly hated someone, I would them to read this book."
3,I didn't like this book.,"I won't say ""Don't purchase this book,"" because different people have different tastes. This wasn't my taste. I read this right after reading ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and the period and focus on class and society has me fatigued.I appreciate the treatment of important axiological and theoretical issues in the piece by Tolstoy. He discusses social science, philosophy, politics, economics, religion. In that sense, the book was a feast for me. And he treated as many perspectives in which he was versed with great respect. One can't read this book and not walk away more intelligent.But my feeling while reading most of this book was one of, ""Christ, get on with it."" Unfortunately, I was saying this through something I actually appreciated; I appreciated his attention to interpersonal relationships and intrapersonal reasoning about these relationships.In short, there are lots of things I appreciate. I appreciate mechanics, but I wouldn't read an 850 page Chilton's manual."
1,This is a poor translation compared with Rosemary Edmonds ...,"This version of the book is a sad replacement for the Rosemary Edmonds's translation. It simply does not read as well as her translation and, if you look closely, you'll realize that Pevear and Volokhonsky often just reversed sentence order, combined two sentences by making one a phrase (or visa-versa), or chose different, less descriptive adjectives than Ms. Edmonds. It is very likely that these two translators had her translation in front of them as they worked. In the end, it is sad that Penguin Classics chose to replace a nice translation with this pretty mediocre one."
5,From Someone Who Knows,Obviously one of Tolstoys greatest works on the human character. Perfectly drawn parallels between marital infidelity and the political tone among the pre-bolshevic era socialites give us a better understanding of late 19th century Russia. This book is absolutely necessary for anyone even interested in the social climate that led Russia into the Communist era. Look for the 1995 Norton edition for those serious in acedemic study.
2,Not as good as Head On for Headaches/Migraines,This product is very gritty and falls all over you like sand. Don't like and very disappointed because I do like the sister (or brother) product for headaches -- the original HeadOn. Perhaps I got a bad batch but not trying it again.
5,Great product,"This is a nice looking product that seems very durable. The dinner plate and the bowls are very large so that there is plenty of room for those who like larger portions. Overall, we are very satisfied with this product."
1,I read it again and it still is the worst I've read,"Okay, perhaps I was having a bad weekend when I first read Black Dog. I read the reviews, and thought that I had surely missed something. So, I looked for the fast paced, well-written and atmospheric novel, as well as the illusive 'aha' moments I'd missed the first time. When I had finished the second reading, I was surprised that the same shallow characters, flimsy plot, and adolesent wet dreams had not disappeared, nor had it reincarnated into borderline literature, or even pulp fiction fit for the loo. Believing my taste buds had died, I passed-on this book to friends as I do all thrillers and mysteries. I am pleased to report that the book has proved to be of some value, it has become a metaphor: 'a black dog' is anything not worth the space it occupies upon the earth. t"
5,First Book in the Series,"A newspaper and magazine journalist for over 25 years, Stephen Booth was born in the English Pennine town of Burnley. He was brought up on the coast at Blackpool, where he began his career in journalism by editing his school magazine and wrote his first 'novel' at the age of 13.Laura Vernon is an intelligent, vivacious young teenager, but now she is missing in the peak District. The local police mount a full-scale search operation, but it is not them who finally find her. Harry Dickinson, a retired lead miner is the man who finally finds the body and for some reason known only to him he seems bent on obstructing the police investigation.Even her parents are holding something back. What could be more important for them than finding the murderer of their daughter. Ben Cooper, a young Detective constable has the known the villagers all his life, but his feelings on the case are brought into question by the arrival of Diane Fry, an ambitious DC from another division . . ."
5,a fun anime series.,"Love Hina must be one of the funniest anime series I've seen. It's about a desperate semi-nerdy guy named Keitaro, who's trying to get into Tokyo U to meet the girl he made a promise with since he was a little boy. The promise was to get there together when they grow up. The problem is that he doesn't remember her name or what she looks like because it's been a long time. Later he ends up living in an all girls dorm surrounded by girls while trying to get into Tokyo U. Love Hina is funny cause there's always wacky scenes going on like Keitaro getting beat up by the girls all the time. It's not just wacky, cause the story and the characters get emotional sometimes. There's always trouble, crazy situations, adventures, and a lot of new characters are introduced throughout the series. All the characters personalities are solid and the storyline is interesting. If you're looking for some fun anime, you should check this out."
2,Can't think of a title,"Although this anime was funny, a whole lot better than Ai Yori Aoshi, it's still a waste of time and money. Why do I even bother to review when all I watch is shojou? Well, because I can. Never buy an anime with the main character as a male because usually they turn out to be some sick fantasy such as this anime. A guy living with a bunch of attractive females, yeah, okay. Dream on."
5,WOW is the word,"Well I saw this series fansubbed a while back, and instantly needed the DVD's. This series is great - Great Story, Great Characters, and great humor. The series contains enough comedy violence to keep you going for years - I've had the DVD for 3 days and already seen it twice! :) This series is great - It's a refreshing change from the seriousness of Evangelion, and the other big series.If you do buy this series, i really reccomend that you watch it SUBBED and not DUBBED, as most of the character dubs are terrible, and the dubbed script misses out many of the small jokes that makes the series even more funny.All in all, a great quality DVD, with a great quality storage box!"
4,Great Anime All Around,"This is a wonderful show with a great sense of humor. Sure, the panty shots of Naru and the other girls gets repetetive, but they're usually followed by some gret humor or punchline. Kitsune does have a Southern accent in the English dub, but the translators took Kitsune's character, which is apparently from Southern Japan, and tried to keep it close to the original dialect, hence the Southern. I prefer the Japanese, which features the always amazing Megume Hayashibara in a smaller role for once, unusual for her. Overall, this is a great show and will make you laugh with the jokes and animation style, which is very clean and great-looking."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: The good thing is that the DVD does have the option of having english subtitles and Japanese audio. The character designs look flawless. This DVD will give you an idea of how the story is gonna go.Cons: The subtitles are in a small font and in yellow color. It is really obvious that the main character, Keitaro Urashima, will probably end up with Naru Naruseagwa. The plot does not follow that of the manga series, but who in the world would expect that? And unlike the manga series the DVD does not have semi-nudity. Kind of choppy.Put it this way. The only reason I bought wass because I wanted to see the characters animated. And of course I wanted to see how their voices would sound like.(...)"
1,"Full of errors, poorly written, a waste of time and money!",I cannot remember a book that was as poorly written as this one nor as full of errors. The authors were clearly more interested in selling a book than in delivering quality and accurate material. I intend to demand my money back.
5,A timeless classic,"The second offering of the Innocence Mission brings further evidence of the hauntingly beautiful voice of Karen Peris. This early A&M; realease while still somewhat (produced sounding) compared to her latest indie releases possesses that intangible combination of melancholy and hope combined with Ms. Peris' breathtaking vocal quality make umbrella a must have.Largely forgotten and overshadowed by the more commercial ""glow"" CD, newcomers to the Innocence Mission would do well to start with umbrella. Sadly A&M; chose not to add Umbrella to their current catalouge. However, it can still be found at this site and at the Gemm site. A highly recommended and underrated classic."
2,Not a Full-size Keyboard,"This is my 4th foldable keyboard. I've have Palm Universal Keyboards that I use often. After reading the good reviews here and bought the product, I have to say I'm disappointed.This keyboard would have been perfect if it's REAL full-size and has dedicated number keys. Why so small? I've not seen anybody carry keyboard in pockets anyway.I can't do touch-typing due to the cramming of keys. It's only good for for occasional typing when I can pay attention to the keys. I can't take lecture notes with it. I miss the dedicated number keys. For these reasons, I have to give it 2 stars."
3,OK But,"The keyboard works and it is much quicker than typing on the on screen keyboard, but...As one reviewer pointed out, the lack of a number row on the keyboard is very annoying when you are trying to type numbers or special characters.It is a little scary folding it back up because it feels like you are breaking it.The bluetooth sync is inconsistent. Sometimes it syncs right away other times I have to fold and unfold the keyboard a few times.All that being said it did make it much easier to write while I was traveling on Amtrak. I did not have to pack my laptop and I could type with both hands."
2,Blackberry 8130/pearl unsupported,This keyboard feels nice and solid yet there is just no support for my blackberry 8130. It does not seem as though the company has any plans to support it either. I really wish i could of tried it out but my phone remains unsupported.
2,Works... sometimes,"Great when it works, but sometimes there is a long delay before character appears. It works with my Motion Tablet PC, but nothing in the instructions addresses setup for anything but a PDA! New problem: endless repeated characters. It finally stops, but I haven't figured out why."
2,"unreliable, iGo slow to replace","Out of the box it started missing keys until one key (the ""b"" key, on the fold) has failed completely. iGo is being slow to replace it (and of course I had to send the defective unit to them first before they would send the replacement). It's also heavier than others on the market (by twice). There is also a long lag each time I start up typing."
4,Works For Me,"The product works well with my Nokia N95 8GB using the built in wireless keyboard application. Though I dislike having to press a function key to input numbers, I don't use it very often and the keyboard performs well enough for my limited needs. I probably would not recommend it for frequent or lengthy periods of text entry."
1,Do not buy this keyboard for a BlackBerry,"I have a BlackBerry Curve 8320 and got this keyboard to use with the device. It does not work with the new OS 4.5 for BlackBerry. I called tech support for iGo and they said they do not and will not support it. They suggested I search on the web for a hack driver that someone might post. This is not the kind of tech support that a reliable company would give! Also, I have not been able to find any after market software to make it work. Avoid...."
1,Product discontinued - Does not support BlackBerry Curve 8330,"This keyboard has been discontinued, so be sure to check compatibility with your SmartPhone / PDA. Does not work with BB Curve 8330 with OS 4.3 or above. iGo shows no concern for this and says there will be no further updates."
1,Discontinued,"Product has been discontinued. No driver for Palm Centro. Tried using driver for Palm Treo, but it locks up my Centro, requiring a hardware reset. Had to re-install all my Palm apps after the reset."
2,NOT FOR BLACKBERRY !!!!!,Maybe this is a good product.It is NOT for any RIM BLACKBERRY!Buyer BEWARE!
2,To many problems,I had problems with:1. Getting it to sync with my Treo.2. My bluetooth headset has not worked since I installed the keyboard.3. Hitting keys on the end of the keyboard causes it to tilt that direction.
2,Unsupported on Mac.,"IGO claims compatibility on the Stowaway Ultra-Slim with Mac based on the logo on their Data Sheet. However, after repeated attempts to resolve problems with their support, IGO now claims they only support OS X 10.0 , not even 10.4 !!. Of course, this is claim is a joke as OS X 10.0 was discontinued LONG before this keyboard existed. Works fine on my Nokia phone though."
1,IGO STOWAWAY KEYBOARD,I WAS DISAPOINTED IN THIS AS IT DID NOT CLEARLY STATE WHAT IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH. I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO HAD T-MOBLE SIDEKICK PHONE AND IT WOULD NOT WORK ON IT. THANK GOODNESS AMAZON DID REFUND IN FULL. LOOKED LIKE A GOOD IDEA THOUGH.
4,Great BT Keyboard,The iGO bluetooth keyboard works great. The only complaint is the extreme left and right tips a little when typing.
5,It's Worth Every Cent!,"I have had this keyboard now for several weeks and I've really enjoyed the impeccable performance of it. I use it with my 'Sony Ericsson P-910i' (PDA Mobile Phone). I use it to type up e-mails and text messages as well as type out lengthy 'Word' documets whilst I'm at loungy cafe's or on long public train rides ...I use it EVERYWHERE I go. It's slick and small yet sturdy and totally reliable. The battery life is incredibly long lasting (still havn't needed to change the included batteries since I got it!)...and I use this keyboard everyday. If you're thinking about getting this keyboard, Stop thinking about it ...just buy it! I'm certain you will not regret it. It's Worth Every Cent!"
1,Misleading information!,I ordered this on the assumption it would work with all Blackberry devices - wrong! After much frustration and a 1hr 'on-hold' with IGo's tech support they admit it only works with a 'few' Blackberry models and not my 7130. W\
1,"Discontinued item, no driver download to device, scumbags","I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip, and complained about typing on a Blackberry. I thought I better install it before sending it after her, so I could guide her along. No PC where she is, so I tried to download as advertised. Result: Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item (?) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer's description while not the web page to support the claim...You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back...If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page, or click on the one star reviews. A shame"
3,worked great until...,"I've had this for about four months now, it was a gift. worked great until a few weeks ago. At first i had to hit the ""m"" key a couple of times before it registered. It got gradually worse from there until the ""m"" ""k"" and ""u"" keys would just not respond. never took it to the beach or dropped it or anything like that. disappointed because I really liked it. it was really convenient, to the point where, paired with my iphone, they pretty much replaced my laptop when i needed to do light work (surfing, emails, papers, etc. )In other words, it worked exactly the way I expected it to, I just didn't expect it to break in a few months."
4,works with the iPad2!,"I bought this to work with a Palm T3, years ago. They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless. It's been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick, but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card. The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and, if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type, it works fine."
3,PDA Stowaway Bluetooth Keyboard,The Keyboard works well enough for now. I'm looking forward to a newer and better generation.
3,Put it with the Video Glasses,"The screen on a PDA is just too small to act as a real input device. The transient state of the memory on a PDA just isn't well suited to investing time in typing up any real information.The keyboard works well for what it is, but isn't terribly practical. If it's really such an emergency, find a computer to borrow. If you are interested in the novelty, go for a full sized bluetooth keyboard. I felt like this thing was going to break as I typed."
4,IGO KEYBOARD,This is a good product easy to use. I returned it because it was not compatible with my phone. I recommend this product.
5,Great Product,"I recently bought this keyboard. It looks cool and it makes using your phone a lot easier. I travel by train a lot and it is nice to be able to surf the web and type with my Smartphone. I actually use my phone for web browsing a lot more now that I have a keyboard. Also, I can type word documents and edit them later. The only issue I have is that you have to type the function keys to get at the #'s it isn't a huge deal but it does get annoying."
4,Great keyboard,"I bought this item while it was on sale. If it wasn't for the lower price, I wouldn't have bothered buying it.The keyboard works very well with my Sprint Touch unit and connection is flawless. The response to typing lags if I am typing really fast, but that shouldn't be a huge issue for me as I do not use this for any type of document creation. Use it only for text messaging at work or at home if I am charging my unit.It has nice features which allows shortcuts to different features, which is nice for web browsing and making blog replys.packed away, it is very slim, but somewhat large. But its large size is needed to have nice typable sized keyboard. But it does not use button batteries, and usage of AAA batteries is really nice.I only gave this 4 stars as it is fairly expensive unit, but if the price doesn't bother you, buy the unit...it works as advertised."
3,Online Players Read!,"I play online for what Doyle what consider low limits (1/2 2/4 3/6 NL as well as sit and gos. Heres the problem with this is book: The strategys Doyle gives you are solid but hardly ever work because the online population is so... STUPID! People play garbage and because so many do you have to ""get lucky"" or develop a good way to play. Doyle lists hands Like AQ offsuit as ""trouble hands"" personally i agree 100%, but with the half wits online who go all in with A10, A9 and Pocket 9s or anything lower. This book WILL help you in some way. But all the information does not apply (it was written nearly 30 years ago) Its defintley worth a read and worth the price."
2,Keep shopping,"I bought this new camera in Nov 2003 and can not take it on trips unless I carry a 48 pack of high energy digital alkaline batteries with me. Don't even try using regular alkaline batteries in it, they are useless."
4,I like it,"Should have come with cord and especially instructions, but overall, I like it and it is a cool little camera, a go getter and does its job."
2,Tasteless Sex,"Could the sex in this book have been anymore obnoxious? Sexual freedom is not about women performing demeaning sex acts to prove that they are just as liberal and erotic as men in the bed.....I wont be buying anymore titles from this author. (Shame on me for being vexed twice --- I bought two titles from this author). Shared this book with several friends, they feel the same way I do."
3,OOOHHHH ZANE,This was a good erotica read. But at sometimes a little much. Zane is my girl but how many ways can you..........well anyway it would have been better if some of those stories were novels on their own.
3,freak a leak....,this was my seccond Zane book it was more like a bunch of short freaky stories... If you are looking for a book with a solid storyline this isn't it. But if you are feeling kinky or you or your mate needs pointers read this.
2,eh!,"I dunno...I am in the middle of reading this and it doesn't really hit my switch, as far as sensuality goes. Maybe I am looking for more literary finesse to complement the sex in these stories?I haven't really delved into erotica as of yet, so I have nothing to compare it to--although Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), of all people, wrote some fiction that nicely worked sexual fantasy into a story line. I found it beautiful and quite erotic.Zane is treating sex like the average guy does. Just a banal fast f*kk. I am looking for nuance, and a pace that actually feels like lovemaking. Good erotica should feed your senses--I want to see, hear, smell, and taste what is going on in the story.That's what separates erotica from porn, because believe me, honey, there is a difference!Her writing lacks sensuality, in my opinion."
2,Dissapointed,"I could not tell from the description of this book and two others which one was for adults. Thus I ended up purchasing a very elementary sunday school book. The description also failed to include the number of pages,"
3,"okay, but...",I didn't like half of the selection sent. Would have done better just buying what I like.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"for as many product the company makes, it was kind of disappointing to only have three items in the bage."
5,A MUST READ BOOK,"This is the amazing story of Susie and Paul Luchsinger. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those who have endured abuse.They tell their story, holding nothing back, about what went on, and then how the Lord helped save their marriage.A MUST READ! Also check out her official site...."
5,the lost abercrombie album,"I'm a huge Abercrombie fan and this album is one of my favorites. Scofield and Abercrombie dig down deep into some jazzy blues lines that make these two guitar players undeniably some of the most creative to ever play the guitar. Abercrombie is magical as always and Scofield is young, bold, and worthy to share the light with this jazz god. I feel like Abercrombie is passing the torch on to another generation. The album [Timeless] materialized the jazz-rock-fusion era by crossing boundaries and steering music into new directions (an unbeatable accomplishment.) This has been handed off to Scofield who has ever since been attempting to move jazz onto a new canvas."
3,Average with much info repeated,"The author has half a dozen or so books (portrait, family, children, etc.) and they are all essentially the same book with little new or different. The book is tediously basic at some points and there are not enough lighting diagrams or other techniques fully explained. Some of the comments are so obvious as to be funny (like joke and play around with children to put them at ease). I also don't think there are enough photo examples that are easy to recreate.Overall, if you are a very new photog interested in a few ideas this may fit the bill. But you don't need to buy more than one of his books."
2,Group Portrait Photography Handbook - Review,"This book did not live up to my expectations. The reader might reasonably expect a handbook to be just that: a treatise that explicates the method used to achieve the examples shown. This would translate to the listing of f stop, shutter speed, lighting arrangement, etc. for the photographic illustration chosen. Unfortunately this information was missing in most of the photos shown in Group Portrait Photography. Although there is some information that the reader can employ when photographing groups, I believe that other books on portrait lighting offer more usable material than was found in Group Portrait Photography. In fact, additional books I own by Mr. Hurter seem superior to this one."
1,Astoundingly awful,"This is, hands down, the most jaw-droppingly bad CD out of the hundreds I own. It's truly incredible, combining weirdly overwrought vocals, cheese-metal or Stones-ripoff minimalist guitar riffs with a sparse Britpop rhythm section. Imagine if John from Trip Shakespeare (whom I love) deliberately set out write the stupidest songs humanly possible, and you're pretty close - so terrible it's entertaining, actually.I notice the CD on my shelf from time to time and think ""it can't really be THAT bad, can it?"" And to my delight, it is! Well worth the $0.01 six people are currently asking for it..."
3,Durability stinks,"The gun's trigger system went to crap after a day of shooting caps, and I'm going to try and return it. If I can't return it then I am going to get an entirely different cap gun. Otherwise, if the gun wasn't a bit crappy I would like it."
4,Good,"Bud Powell is considered the best bop pianist of all-time. This album is a nice introduction to his work, although personally, I prefer Vol. 2 (not as many alternates). Also, this album succumbs to my pet peeve: placing alternate versions immediately after the released takes. CD programming will remove that little problem."
3,Disappointing first read of Amanda Scott's work,"I wanted to like this book so much but couldn't make myself do it. This is the first book I've read of Ms. Scott's and had heard she wrote a good Scottish tale. Well, I agree that her writing skills are above average and her dialogue flows well but I just couldn't get into the story. I enjoy a strong female character but I couldn't get excited about her relationship with the male lead. I usually can't wait to begin reading the next in a series but I have no desire to read anymore about these characters. I don't like giving bad reviews but I can't recommend this book. I will read more books by Ms. Scott because I don't believe in dismissing someone's work on the basis of one book. I gave this book 3 stars versus 2 stars because I did finish the book. I reserve 1 or 2 stars for unreadable books."
1,A rather disappointing read.......,"This was my First Amanda Scott book, and I was very disappointed. Although I tend to thrive on accurate and detailed historical data within my Highland (romance) novels, these details seemed ""pushed"". They distracted you from the story line rather than enhanced it. Rather than a book I couldn't put down, this book was a ""chore"" I rather disliked forging through. The only reason I finished the book was because I ""wasted"" my money to purchase it, and because I couldn't see how the main character was going to arrive at his ""desired end state"". Still a disappointment and I dare say I will not be purchasing another Amanda Scott book."
4,Very Good! Look at the year!,"Jumpy, Catchy, Dancy!Jazz and HipHop, Blues, Swing, Bossa, Dub - it's all there.Very good beats. Atmospheric and cheering.Have it!"
3,Good Music,"I had a copy of this cd already, but I don't know where it is. So I bought the cd again. All I can say is if you like Herb Alpert and you like a hip groove, this is a nice cd."
4,Working very well,This IR portable keyboard work very well with my HP IPAQ 1940 machine. Now I can use it in class to take notes. The only problem is you can only type on a table top or any flat surface - it won't work if you wanna type on top of your lap.
5,Great Product,"I have a Samsung i700 Pocket PC/Telephone. I was a little leary of this product because I could not find any real data telling me how this keyboard would work with my device. I was delighted that not only did it work with my device but it did so right out of the box. I did not have to do anything but follow the directions and I was up and running. I have used it almost everyday without a problem. My device is a little larger than most so it slides a little when I am aggressive with my typing, but a little nudge and I am back to work. Compared to the tiny touch screen keyboard that is installed on my device this keyboard is a God send. It folds up quickly and easily and drops right into my pocket. Best money I have ever spent."
3,...,"As much as I loved Alex, I didn't really love Yasmine. But I disliked her stupid friend even more. The secondary romance of Cassie and Drew was cute, until Cassie started getting really bitchy and dumb. She refused to be in a relationship with him, she just wanted sex, and even after she apologized for misleading him, she still said she wasn't going to be exclusive with him, just keep having sex. Which is pretty selfish and unfeeling first of all, since Drew was the sweetest character in the whole book. Also, she was a bad influence on Yasmine.This is the last Jamie Sobrato book I'm reading, because in my opinion, this twit can't write. She's inaccurate, can't spell, and doesn't write romance. The pick-up line she gave Yasmine was ""I want to have hot, nasty sex with you.""That's not even hot or sexy. That's just lusty, in a bad way."
5,no problems,I recieved the order quickly and in good condition. No problemsDefinately not for beginners- a good challenge
3,Drum solo Choreography,"I found this DVD good for developing new choreography in drum solo technique as it introduced a strong selection of combinations applicable to many situations. There was no attempt to focus on rhythm training, the context of movements within the music or a more holistic approach to working with rhythms, naming rhythms and appropriate steps to popular rhythm changes found in drum solos or how these can be approached in general. Nevertheless the steps and combinations introduced would add to the repertoire of any dancer and the clarity and methodical nature of the teaching was thorough and effective."
4,This One Delivers,"So many times cookbooks leave you feeling somehow foresaken. You turn to them expecting to find a hand on the shoulder and a step by step help through the labor of all the dishes presented within its pages; but, so many times it never happens. This one stays with you and never leaves your side. A true bonus--if you are covered over with the business of life, and find time to be a premium--is that several dishes can be prepared within the confines of a single crimped-foil-envelope. Simply add the ingredients, cook and cut open the foil. Can it get easier? All of this, and it's a fun read as well. If you enjoy the show, you will LOVE this book!"
4,great sport sunglasses,"a hint of style, comfortable, clear, I always get polarized sunglasses, this is my first pair of Zeal's and I think I'm hooked!"
1,Does not stay elevated on chair,"Very comfortable if only it would stay elevated on the chair to fit the contours of your back. Has a very weak elastic band to keep the heavy cushion up on the chair, always slides to the bottom where the cushion does the least good."
3,Comfortable but not the End All/Be All,"I have had this backrest now for over a year. I sit in a chair most of my day at work and unfortunately do not have the greatest posture. Immediately, I loved the Obus Forme. As time went on, I still had issues with my posture and it did not relieve me of all my previous backpain from sitting so much. I would recommend this cushion if the alternatives are far more expensive. I could not do without it anymore as it is definitely better than just my regular office chair. But, I believe their are better options out there even maybe in the form of a more ergonomic chair. Unfortunately, those run in the hundreds to thousands.Overall, I would recommend this as the more economical alternative to an affordable backrest."
2,not that great,"Was initially impressed with the backrest; however, because the straps are not adjustable, it dosen't stay in place. The one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place."
4,Good Lowback Support,"I was happy to find this backrest support at a ""good price"" and more importantly living up to its' claim of back discomfort relief. It fits easily into a leather executive chair and provides additional back support without substantially diminishing the seating portion of the chair.The only challenge is the fabric covering, it ""attracts"" hair from my cats.Complete information on the product is at [...]"
4,unfluffy,"This cd certainly doesn't go down easy at all times, but contains some of Baerwald's most adventerous and heartfelt songs to date. Baerwald should be congratulated for flexing his sardonic wit and reaching deep inside for some truely moving music. It is my personal opinion of course but I consider everything from the instrumentation to the lyrical content some of the best of his career, making the disc continually challenging and enjoyable with each new listen. Saw David in Austin and he performed at least three of these songs some of the strongest of the set."
4,"Nice brushes, good variety","I bought these brushes at the same time I bought some others here on amazon and these came in second place. These brushes are just ok, the heads on mine were a little loose and the handles are chipping as I use them and wash them. They still work pretty well and I have not had any loose hairs coming off on my canvas. I use these with acrylics and am painting on canvas and wood. I probably will not buy these again but they were not terrible."
1,Hideous Kinky,"Trash is an elevated term for this junk. It plays like a soft-core episode of ""Perry Mason"". In full Razzie form Madonna does her worst Catherine Tramell impression. She was more seductive in the ""Open Your Heart"" video. Julianne Moore had a hotter bod than Madge in her one nude scene. Willem Dafoe seems bored content to do the two-backed beast with the Material Girl. The only person who survives dignity intact is Joe Mantegna. He keeps his clothes on. A must if you absolutely have to see Madonna in the buff."
1,Drama/Murder Mystery or low grade Porn Flick Strike three on both,I rated this a one since there are no lower ratings.What is right about this movie? Nothing.What is wrong?1) Children in a 4th grade play has better acting skills.2) Is it a Murder Mystery or a Low grade Porn flick. It is both and neither. It struck out on both.3) DO NOT let your children watch this movie. If you want to enjoy a good Murder mystery or a Porn flick pick other titles.
1,"RIDDLE ME THIS, RIDDLE ME THAT---","Quick--what stars Madonna and Wilem Defoe, is pornographic trash, a very bad Basic Instinct rip-off, and stinks?"
3,Body of Evidence,It wasn't much of a story but of course that wasn't why I watched the movie. There was enough plot and nudity to keep me interested to finish the movie. Its worth seing once.
2,Trashy and so bad that it's not even much fun,"The Bottom Line:One of those sleazy erotic thrillers that were hastily rushed into production once Basic Instinct became a smash, Body of Evidence has lawyer Willem Dafoe falling for femme fatale Madonna, who's on trial for using her sexy, sexy body as a deadly, deadly weapon; it sounds like it'll be lots of unsophisticated fun but it's actually just incredibly bad, misogynistic, dumb, etc.1.5/4"
3,"Pretty hokey even for a ""madonna"" movie","But, in her defense the whole cast was almost as bad. No pun intended but all the scenes seemed to be played tongue and cheek. I think this movie was just filmed to promote Madge's well kept body, so if for that reason, it has done it's job. Oh, and I really liked her house boat, I wouldn't mind living on one of those. But I imagine I'd have to be as wealthy as her to live on one."
3,A poor mans Basic Instinct,"Firstly, I didn't think this was a bad film at all.Its has an interesting storyline (see above), the acting is acceptable (its a shame we have to mention this when talking about Madonna's movies), and the sex scenes are definately raunchy (actually, more explicit than I would have expected - however this was during Madonna's SEX / rebellious period).The problem is that it came AFTER Basic Instinct which is a far superior film, more stylish, more dramatic and more enjoyable. The script let the film down at times too, giving Madonna some silly one-liners ""Have you ever seen animals make love Frank? Its brutal"".Enjoyable and definately worth a viewing."
5,Simple Minds' best,"Real Life could be easily cataloged as one of the best albums of the Scottish band and one of the best albums of the 1990s. After Street Fighting Years, Real Life is one of the most mature creations of this emblematic rock band. The album has an impressive and refined sound and with the re mastered edition it highlights its quality. Many of the songs not included in other compilation albums, really worth this album."
1,Avid fan of ms Hill,This copy was xerox end and very faint. Would give anyone over 50 a headache to read. Terrible excuse for publishing!!!!
2,Couldn't finish it,I tried to read this book but it is so long and drawn out - thought it would never get anywhere with the story.
2,Blah,"I read a lot of old-fashioned books, so I'm not easily put off by a slow pace, descriptive paragraphs, and morals from an earlier era, when men were gentlemen and women were virtuous in novels. But this one just about activated my gag reflex. The kids from California were just too good to be believable (Aunt Cloudy Jewel doesn't want us to do that, so we won't do that, even though we've always liked doing that). Come on, Kids, show a little spark! And Cloudy Jewel was just insipid. She'd been taught to think and see in black and white, and it never occured to her to try and see a different point of view (Dancing is wicked, so the kids must give up dancing). No problem the little family faced was very important, and the kids obeyed her in everything. The few times they did try to rebel ended badly--but not too badly--Auntie was disappointed in them, and the kids felt guilty, repented and never did it again. Bleah.I have crossed Grace Livingston Hill's books off my list of must reads."
4,"A Good, Clean, Christian Read","Julia Cloud reared her siblings and has nursed her invalid mother for years. The book opens just after her mother's death, and Julia is depressed, as she considers her future. Her sister expects her to go live with her family, but Julia knows she will be treated as a servant there. When her niece and nephew show up and want her to come be their mother as they move into a house together for college, it seems to be a Godsent. She soon realizes, however, they have never been exposed to Christian faith, and she begans to try to show them what they've missed out on.There are some long explanations of Biblical truths, but I found these to be discussed in an interesting way. The story was overly sweet and simplistic in places, but, overall, I found it to be enjoyable. If you're looking for a good, clean read, the price is right for free."
5,Cloudy Jewel,"This was a ""Jewel"" of a find. I am new to ereaders and had no experience using them when I purchased this book. It is beautifully written and easy to read. As a christian woman today, I was surprized to find a leading character who was an older single christian woman. What a delightful surprize!! I connected with ""Cloudy Jewel"" immediately and even brought ""her"" into my real life, asking her advice on ""What would she do in this situation?"". I was sorry to say goodbye when the story ended. I would definetly be interested in a second story featuring Cloudy Jewel."
5,An admirable woman,"To those who still call her ""Hanoi Jane"": have you never made a mistake in your life? The woman has admitted she made a mistake and apologized for it, what more can we ask? To continue to make her a pariah is to ignore all of the good she has done--still does, and will do: this is a courageous, extraordinary woman, and a remarkable actress, who has led an fascinating life. She, and her book, should be valued."
3,Boy Band Sound...,Some of the songs are a little of old school boy band sound. I really like his more recent stuff. But this isn't bad!!!! He has developed a worship style that is amazing. Listen to his new tunes!!!
4,Classic Conan,"This is my favorite Conan story. I have read it twice myself, and now I'm reading it to my two sons. The language is clear and simple. The strength, courage, kindness, and wisdom of Conan are brought across by detailed descriptions of his actions. Nothing that he does is beyond possibility. We see that Conan is always prepared to die, but also always determined to take as many of his enemies with him as possible, and it is this that sees him through so many adventures. The female interest in this story is strong and capable in her own right, and the way Conan slowly wins her affection through his actions sets a good example that I would be delighted to see my sons follow, although perhaps with less physical suffering and chance of dismemberment by demons. The author's description of an amazonian female warrior culture is thought-provoking. If you want a relaxing adventure novel with a swashbuckling hero and some engaging characters, you'll enjoy this book."
3,Action Packed but LONG,"I read this book a little while ago and thought that it was overall a pretty good book, but during the middle/beggining of it I thought that it was a bit LONG. But if you like a good story that is interesting, than I recomend this to you, but if your itching for action than I don't recomend this to you."
5,Turkey Platter,"This is just what we needed for Thanksgiving. It was big enough for the large turkey that we bought to feed 25 people. In addition, it can be used for any type of large roast. Well worth the cost."
5,IP Video 9100a Plus,Device does what was needed. I loaded the Yoics firmware on it and solved a problem I had with gathering video from analog cameras.
3,"FORGET THE BOOK, BUY HIS NEW DVD","THE BOOK MOST CERTAINLY LOOSES SOMETHING IN THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION. WHY MERCADO WROTE A BOOK, I DO NOT KNOW. MERCADO IS A VISUAL MEDIUM, SKIP THE BOOK, SKIP ANYTHING EXCEPT THE DVD."
1,Use this book only in extreme emergency!,"Fortunately there are a lot of good books on the market. Personally, I don't see how this one got published. There is, in my opinion, a lot of wrong information contained in this book, and I would strongly advise anyone except the most decorating challenged to stay away from this publication. I am not a novice, but a professional with more than 20 years in the design field. I'm sorry to see that books like this get to market. For anyone wanting to decorate on their own try one of these books. Laurie Ward's ""Use What You Have Decorating"", Waverly's ""Inspirations"", ""The Domain Book of Intuitive Home Design"" or Jennifer Raffo's ""Fabrique Technique."" These are books in my professional opinion that will truly help the do-it-yourself decorator."
1,A disappointment,"I guess it's because there are so many good decorating books on the market that this one stands out for its lack of quality, both in ideas and in execution of those ideas."
2,Very Basic,If you are looking for an instruction manual on how to sew certain window treatments or how to cut/install molding then this book may be for you. As far as inspiring designs or color schemes this book comes up lacking.
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this concert because of the reviews. They had to be made by diehard fans because these songs are embarassing to regular rock and roll fans. Horribly lame lead vocals, long, drawn-out solos induced by cocaine and tediously long songs create a feeling of ""I've been had!"". I was hoping Frampton would carry the load but he can only do so much. In this case it was a lost cause.... D:"
4,I'm spoiled too death,"I was just hoping that the sound quaility would have been a little better. Okay, maybe 4.99 stars would have been closer. Its so hard to imagine that that music was so good that people would turn to disco in just a few short years. ""I don't need no doctor"" has been one of my favorite songs since I could grow peach fuzz. I'm always singing it."
3,Great performance by the Band - sack the production guy!,"I had this album years ago and played it into destruction!It was a good live sounding album.The CD sound is as limp as it can get. I have made better sounding CD's on my Linux computer than this.Whoever mastered this CD needs to change jobs, I'm even considering re-mastering my copy it's that poor.So buy it for the bands sake and play it on something cheap and cheerful.CheersFrank"
5,FABULOUS RESOURCE,"Wheather you are in the scene or just curious what all this stuff called ""techno"" is, this book is an indespensible resource. It reads not only as a ""biography"" of modern dance culture but in a way a manifesto or an epic history of the life of ""dance music"". Learn about our forefathers and treat yourself to stories of their genius. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,A Wonderful Recording from One of the Greatest Trumpeters,This recording is truly one of the best records I own. Morgan's flawless solo on Ceora as well and the hard driving solos on ther other tracks are truly amazing. A sure buy for any jazz lover.
1,user,Have not been able to get the program to load properly. Get an error message 1606 and have not been able to correct. Just wasted my money.
3,camerwork blows,"The technology of the era really hurts this dvd. Great concert, but alas, it only rises to the technology of the era. Get it for historical reasons but not for concert viewing excellence. Some will like, some will not. We watched it once and not twice, a sure indication that something wasn't quite right."
2,Alas a tad tedious...,"Always have been curious about this gig, a curious mixture of characters on stage from Klaus Voorman, Billy Preston, Ringo, and of course Dylan. What stands out is how frankly mediocre a songwriter George Harrison was, the sentiments are in the right place but apart from Badfinger this give a good sniff of why Punk had to happen a few years later... Nice Dylan though."
4,JT's gift,"Unable to give honest review as this was purchased as a Christmas gift. I saw the original movie in the theater when first released. I loved it then and am sure since George Harrison is my grandson's favorite Beatle, he will enjoy it too."
5,magnificent: a door for benefit aids,"this film represents more than a single appearance of rock stars and indian music genius Ravi Shankar: is the open door to all new support aids, from Live Aid to Concert for Unicef and We are the World.the help that george harrison, with a little help from his friends, was the most generous act of Love that world meet in the XXth century, almost a Jesus act...greetings...JOnAS Gould as a paquito's guest..."
1,too fragile,"It costs a few cents but delivery is around 5 or 6 dollars each one, so if u buy 3 is $15, 4 is $20, etc. I have bought several of them, and the front cover is the first thing that breaks, it is too fragile, it breaks easily, the last one I bought only last 4 days. I didn't mind at the beginning the breaking part because I was planning to buy many of them, but as i said before the delivery increases too much for that.I like the design. The piece that cover the rest of the phone is hard, that one has not broken in none of my previous purchases, but I just threw them away cause you want to protect the whole phone."
2,"Broke right away, under no stress",I bought it for protection against minor bumps and scratches. within 24 hours it had already cracked while just sitting in my pocket.
5,An enjoyable lesson!,"This is a far cry from the dry business ""How to"" book. Mr. Nemeth opens a new dimension of understanding time management and how to apply it to every business. He doesn't tell you how to get there, he brings you there. This book helped me to step back and take a refreshing look at our workflow. It is a light-hearted read addressing a serious subject, lost time means lost customers equals lost profits. Take the time to read this book and then gain the time back by applying its MARKET EFFICIENCY methods."
1,"Shame on you ""musicians"" !!!","First of all, I want to state that I am a Black metal musician as well as a fan. Bands like Emperor,Dissection,Enslaved brought glory and majesty to black metal. However, bands like Marduk gave it a name of Drunked Evil ""wannabees"". First two marduk albums were not so horrid, but still mostly boring. This sounds like noise, this album is crap. If you really need some brutality, listen to Zyklon,Gorgoroth or Gehenah. I can imagine who would even buy such crappy album. I bought this CD, and that was a great mistake. Now it's a shelf-material (and it'll be shelfed for eternity)..."
2,not the best marduk,"I have all the marduk cds and i love them all. This one is unfortunately boring and repetitive. Don't get me wrong it sounds like marduk but is lacking the ""it"" factor. Go with early marduk or later marduk but you can pass on this one. I am giving it two stars only cause i love the band."
1,Do NOT shop at gemaffair,"My husband bought me a lovely ring from gemaffair for Christmas. It was the ring I always dreamed of. I got dressed for Christmas. When I arrived at my mother's house, one of the stones had fallen out. I did nothing unusual except get dressed.I returned the ring to gemaffair (at my own expense). They say that since I ""damaged the ring"" they would not accept the return, wanted over $50 for a repair (the ring cost $140) or they would return it to me, but I had to pay the 6.95 shipping. Do they think I intentionally broke the ring? I didn't feel any catching or pulling of any sort. Frankly if I had, I would have just taken it to my own jeweler for repair since I would have recognized that I broke the ring. I have dozens of rings, in many settings and styles. I have never broken a prong, nor have I ever been so dissatisfied with a vendor. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT shop here. Their service stinks....and the merchandise quality is lousy."
1,Nice Songs But Poorly Recorded,"While it is nice to hear early Joan, audiophiles will not be pleased with this release. Volume is erratic and on many cuts her voice audibly distorts. The label Emus is not well known. They should have spent more time and effort properly recording Baez's beautiful voice."
1,"""Hero"" crossed the line","I have enjoyed Coulter's books very much. But I, too, am not keeping this one. Our ""hero"" does cross the line with the out-and-out... scene which was not necessary to the story. After that, he does not redeem himself (could anyone??) nor deserve her forgiveness and love. Her ""transgressions"" that he perceived are nowhere near that serious; this goes beyond the typical ""misunderstanding"" angle usually involved in a good story.Probably [this] occurred more often than we'd like to believe in that time period, but that doesn't mean I want to read about it or that I will like the character(s).I am now starting the ""Bride"" Trilogy with ""The Sherbrooke Bride""...I am happy to say so far, so good!"
3,It was okay,".... However, it is a romance novel and we must suspend disbelief. on that account, I enjoyed Kate's character. she was strong basically throughout the novel and although she capitulated in the end, I still liked her. characters who should be followed up are Julian's bachelor pals. I really liked Percy adn Hugh. they are good friends to julian and Kate. They were willing to defend her honor when julian behave like a cad. (You start talking like this after a couple of novels)Julian is persistently annoying. ...."
1,I did not like this book!,"This book left me depressed. I have bought many books based on the comments listed and I think this one was off target. This is only the second book I read by this author. After reading books by Amanda Quick, I don't want to wait till the end of the book for our couple to get together. This book was not as cruel as Rosemary Rogers' books, but close. I do not recommend it."
2,I WAITED FOR THIS!,"After a week and a half to finally get this from amazon I must say how disappointed in the sound on this was. Don't the people who produce this disc listen to the end result on how it sounds? Out of the more than 70 concert videos I own, this really is one of the worst! Having a really good system; dvds either sound great, or pretty bad, this was the latter! I actually gave this two stars instead of one because the picture was real good. With so many good dvds out there I was really surprised they didn't do a better job on the way the sound was done, this really takes the enjoyment out of watching this concert. Unfortunatly I'll be returning this back to amazon as defective."
1,No talent boring losers...,"If you want a real eye popping, ear bleeding rock and roll orgasm...buy the nine inch nails bluray. I couldn't even finish this foo fighter disc, sold it on fleabay."
5,Late to the game,"I found the music of the Foo Fighters a little late. I never thought of going to one of their shows, and since it would appear that they are no longer touring I am glad I bought this Blu-Ray. For others out there that love the FOO but missed out on ALL of their tours you will not be disappointed.ETA: saw them in Atlanta in Nov., OMG best concert ever."
5,Awesome concert,Great concert!! Audio is pretty good. Sounds better than being there being hooked up to a Pioneer VSX-1018 biwired to Eosone RSF-600's. You can these guys enjoy playing together.
4,Entertaining,"I found Speidel's book to be an entertaining view of Seattle's early days and people. His geographic comparison of then and now provided me with more depth of understanding about why things are as they are, including recent events with mass transportation as well as obsessive popular referenda."
1,Only Worthwhile If You Live In The States,"This book was a waste of money for me because it's made for people who live in North America. As an Australian, there are recipes in this book I am unable to make because some of the ingredients required do not exist here. I realised my mistake in buying this book when I opened it to see ounces instead of grams and kilograms. Can you imagine converting all those weights for every recipe? I can't."
5,Superb Book,I highly recommend this book to one and all. I bought it for my pregnant daughter-in-law who was so impressed she ordered one for me. The recipes are healthy and wonderful. Nancy Ely-Raphel
2,THIS IS SEXY?,"The popularity of this series eludes me. If this is sex in NYC, I'll pass thank you. To me, Sarah Jessica Parker is the epitomy of thr pseudo sophisticated New Yorker. She is about as captivating as a wet noodle. This series makes ""Red Shoes Diaries"" look like hard core porn.I'll take Cinemax any day."
5,A Gift for my wife,"I bought this series as a gift for my wife in mother's say and I gotta day she ended up loving It and me too, is a pretty good show the quality of the package was excellent and the dvds were in mint condition I already got the second season which I bought through Amazon as well and the way I see it I going to end up getting the complete series...I recommend this seller for any DVD you wanna get and I recommend Sex and the City for some good advises.Enjoy.-"
3,"fast shipping, damaged case","fast shipping, but packaging came slightly damaged, when it was supposed to be shipped 'new.'"
5,The BEST!,"I have watched my DVD over and over again. This is the season that made this show a hit. The episodes are funny and never get old. This is a DVD you can curl up with for hours! It's also great for a girls night in, a bottle of wine, and bonding. I highly recommend!"
3,"Good, but sound quality on DVD edition is lacking","The sound quality on this DVD was lacking. My television has mono, and not stereo, sound, and so I get either left or right sound. Every other DVD I've played has balanced left and right sound, but when playing this one the sound quality is terrible and very hard to hear. When played on a new stereo system though, no problems! This is a warning for anyone with a mono television that buys this particular DVD."
3,DVD Edition,"The series is fun and provocative, not for the faint at heart! The complete first season is on the dvd set including the first episode which seems to be more of a pilot (?). You can really see how the series got better, as they fazed out the awkwardness of Carrie talking directly into the camera during her reflection moments instead of voice over.The keepsake box is very attractive. But if you are buying this on dvd for higher quality with the picture, save your money. There is still a lot of grain. I was very dissapointed with the quality of the dvd.As for the special features, there really isn't much. Apparently there is an interactive section, but you have to be running Windows 95 + to use it, which I am not. Another dissapointment.Still the series is definitely highly enjoyable and you can easily find yourself watching all 12 episodes in a row. The series itself, wonderful! The DVD, a little bit of a let down."
2,review is for the dvd...,The shoe is great. My review is for the Dvd. The only advantage in buying the dvd is to skip shows. The transfer is awful!! I can not stress this enough. I have vcr tapes that have been taped over multiple times that look better!!!! beware on this one if you expect to get at least a decent xfer!
4,Sex and New York,Having seen this program a few times on HBO I looked forward to the DVD. This is a show that is geared towards women more than men although I enjoyed the program as much as my wife. Since the show is now in its 4th season I can't wait until the 2nd and 3rd searson are released. I hope that next DVDs are more consistent as many of the episodes are grainy.
1,Absolute garbage,HBO is trying to push the envelope with this trash. It is very sad that these women seek to find love through casual sex as opposed to true meaningful relationships.
5,Brilliant!,"The appeal of this show seems to me, in part, by the fact that there is a little bit of Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte in all of us. When Im feeling self-indulgent... or just up for a laugh - this does the trick everytime!!!"
4,"Excellent series, poor dvd","This is the best series on television right now. Hands down! I would love to see Seinfeld with a DVD collection of its own! Sure, the content can be quite disturbing to some viewers, but I am not one of those. I am a guy in his 20s who loves sex....and the city!My only complaint is the video quality. A friend of mine has teh VHS version and sometimes it produces better images than my dvd copy. And its not my machine, this is a complaint I have heard of many times before. At times the images are very grainy, and make it difficult to view some objects in the backround.You might be saying who cares! Well, they shouldn't bother with the DVD version if they can't get the video quality straighted out. Hopefully for the second season HBO will realize this."
4,Works but 1 Time use?,I used this to remove a stripped exhaust stud on my Harley Road King. The tool worked great but it appears to be a 1x use as I don't see how to remove the stud from the tool? It appears I will have to use a Dremel and try to cut the stud out of the tool.
2,Home School Mom,"This book was not at all what I expected. I thought It was a work book, It is simply a manual, explaining the rules of punctuation. There are no work sheets for the student to work with. This is not something that my homeschooler would benefit from."
4,Great Skin,"This is a great, protective skin for the Zen V, exactly as advertised. Only one problem that is very minor, after being in you pocket it collects lint that sticks to it and cripples the appearence, easy to get of as long as your thub is slightly wet."
3,Holiday Gift,This was a gift so I can't review the item per se.I can say the gift was ordered the week of Xmas and arrived to the gift recipient before the holiday.Thanks.
5,Cool Struttin' first,"This album is ranked among the top half-dozen Blue Note albums, and so it is well worth getting. If you are wondering which Sonny Clark album to buy, this is a good start for sure, but I like Cool Struttin' a bit better. Of the three albums I have, I find Sonny's Crib least interesting. Crib was recorded in '57, Struttin' in '58, and Leapin' and Lopin' in 61."
4,Pushing the blues,"What comes to mind when listening to the music here, is that it is the opposite of the way Hank Mobely and his group played on Soul Station.Mclean and his group are playing a whole album based on the 12 bar (or 16 bar) blues form, but they approach the blues from a whole different place. There is no softness or gentleness here. The blues is attacked with full force by all participents. Even the second track, which is at a slow tempo, is played double and triple time by Mclean and Hubbard.I feel that for the overall sound of the CD, some balance is missing, some relaxed, layed back moments that would ease the tension. This is why I would not recommend as a blues album, but as a hard edged hard bop album based on the blues form."
4,70s classics plus one,"I haven't seen these, but I was curious to see which movies were included. For those of you who didn't see all the titles on the cover, here they are with their IMDB ratings (1-10 scale):Wild Riders, 1971, 5.6The Young Graduates, 1971, 4.6 (Bruno Kirby)Chain Gang Women, 1971, 3.4The Specialist, 1975, 3.6 (Adam West)Death Machines, 1976, 2.8The Van, 1977, 3.9 (Danny DeVito)Don't Answer the Phone!, 1980, 4.1Brain Twisters, 1991, 3.3I doubt that many drive-ins ever showed Brain Twisters, but there it is. Enjoy!"
2,Lasted 18 months,"So, the lid started opening and closing. I put in new batteries (the old ones were still fine, I checked with a volt meter). I followed their advice to reset it by taking out the batteries for 24 hours, and to clean the IR sensor.I called ninestar today to see what they say. The man almost laughed when he said it was ""basically kaput"". I said it was lightly used, he said one year warranty, sometimes trash humidity messes up the circuit board. I said I would think they would put some epoxy resin on the board to protect it. He said he guessed they could, but they don't.Very dismissive and rude. Sorry, [...], your customer relationship department truly stinks."
4,Really great trashcan,"We bought this probably 5 years ago now and it finally quit working this year so we will be getting another. Others are right that it's a little glitchy. I find that if you turn it off for a few minutes, then turn it back on again, it resets. The battery compartment doesn't like getting wet so it's sort of hard to keep the inside of the lid clean. And the ring isn't perfect about keeping the bag up, you drop or push something in the bag and you could lose the top of the bag in your trash.But all of these things are pretty expected and the product is worth the hassle. I have not had to deal with customer service."
1,sensor not working after one day,"I have this product for one day!!!! And the motions sensor stops working, despite one day old batteries. I have contacted the company and left a message. I was not able to talk to a real person. Lets see if the customer service works at least works.Just now, before I wrote a bad reveiw I thought of contacting them via their website [...], but it'snot working either - just like their trashcan!"
4,Touchless motion sensor trash can,"I bought this can in an attempt to limit the buffet my dog was having in our trash can. I had a limited space where a can could fit, this one fits nicely. The sensor works fine, my only thing is lining the trash bag with the plastic inner part and not having it slip down."
2,Died after about a year - lid kept open/closing on its own,"I have owned this trash can and have had 2 of this canNine Stars Touchless Automatic Motion Sensor Trash Can, Set of 2. I don't think I would buy this one again as it started open/closing like it was demon possessed after about 9mon-1year.Pros:- Good infrared response and is fairly quiet (quieter than the other one)- Nice lid orientation to take up less spaceCons:- Lid malfunction after about a year- Plastic ring on the inside keeps slipping inside- Super sensitive infrared to things walking by"
1,Damaged BOTH times,"I am so disappointed with this product. I received my trashcan a week late (I paid for 2 day shipping), luckily was refunded by Amazon for the shipping (thank you Amazon). Not only was the trash can dented in multiple spots but the lid did not fit. I returned the first trashcan and received a new one very quickly (again, Thank You Amazon).Not to my surprise....the second trashcan was coming apart at the rim. And, AGAIN the lid did not fit. I am done dealing with this....what a waste. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT. BUYER BEWARE! $70 down the drain!!!"
5,Touchless Trash Can,Every home should have one! Opens every time. Cleaner then those flip tops. Compact size for the space you have.
2,Problems with battery compartment lid,"We really like this can, it's a good size, the touchless sensor works fine. But we're on the second lid now, and once again, the plastic battery compartment lid is broken. The kids knocked the lid off tonight and in the process broke off the tiny plastic bits that hold the battery compartment lid on. We know from experience that duct tape won't hold the weight of the batteries for very long, and while you can buy just the cover if that breaks, the pieces that broke off are attached to the lid itself. I'm facing the $35 lid replacement or just giving up & buying a new product. Which is what I'm going to do this round after being in this position less than 6 months ago."
2,easily broken,When I got this trash can I was so impressed.... the smell doesn't leak... But after 2 weeks the sensor feature was broken..... I accidentally got wet while cleaning the top part and now it's not working anymore even after I let it dry :(
5,The Gift of Fire,"I found this book to be a very enjoyable read. Yes, it is a short book, and the author promises that as the series develops the length of the books increase. I already have book two and look forward to reading it. As an elderly adult (62) I am not the target audience of the author, but do not let age be the determining factor on a decision to read it or not. I recommend this book for reading by any age."
5,Brilliance!,Keaton was in top form here. Brilliant from the first frame to the last and this film alone cements Buster's rep in the comedy hall of fame. BUY IT.
1,awful,no words can describe how i rate this...it is so old and weird and just plain cheesy...bad bad choice lol
2,broken bag,I received these seeds and the bag was split and the seeds were everywhere. I don't know how many of the seeds were saved but I'm sure a lot were lost. The bags are not strong enough to survive in transit.
3,Fun premise,"I liked the idea of reversing the stereotype of ""the butler did it"" and having the butler be the victim, but I found this one kinda dull. I realize it was one of her first mysteries so I guess she just hadn't hit her stride yet."
4,If you watched them movie this is a book you will like.,"I read this book for my 8th grade english and reading class. I never really heard of the book, but of course like ever one else in the United States have seen then the musical State Fair. The book was a lot like the book. The reading goes really fast. If you want a book that you can read in a day or two this is the book you should pick."
3,Crescent Mechanics Tool Set - 148 Piece,"The kit works well for our application (large system electronics repair). We have only noticed one problem. When you pull the socket bits out of the driver, the magnet breaks off and can be lost. Out of the 9 kits that we purchased 4 of them have broken. Over all we are happy with the product, but have sent back the bit driver for exchange."
5,great buy for the money,"I can get a cheaper set of tools for sure, but not this quality for the price.So if you dont want a socket to bust or a ratchet to let lose and in both casesyou end up losing a pound of flesh because the tool broke under stress. Then youbetter stick to quality. These tools are of GREAT QUALITY FOR THE PRICE !Not as good as Snap On but as good as SEARS craftsman."
2,What happened?,"Fortunately, I read Vanished Child first. I'm not sure what happened in between these two books but The Knowledge of Water was very dissapointing. The thought behind the book was good. But the book itself was hard to read and easy to put down. As an example, I have waited through two books for Reisden and Perdita to get married, their wedding was in one paragraph written in third person. Sarah Smith seems to lose you during the important parts and tries to get you into the parts of no relevance."
5,Meet the Care Bears,"I could not have asked for a better transaction. Quick, efficient, and the product was exactly as described. Good job!!"
5,A GREAT GIFT,This book was actually purchased by my wife for a friend. My wife already has a copy and LOVES it and whenever she talks to someone who has back pain she tells them to read this book. She swears by it. This book offers ways you can heal your back pain through simple exercises and practices; which for people who don't have an eagerness to have surgery and loss the most important part of their bodies is VERY important.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Some rave about this one. I don't mind it, but I much prefer the Hard Travelling Heroes, and Quiver, among others, and even the Archer's Quest. I always liked my Green Arrow the other way, hero as opposed to roo shooter."
4,"Great product, but misleading Ad","This is a great storage solution, very easy to setup, and offers plenty of storage. I actually had about 4 more shelves than I needed once I set everything up. Setup was a breeze, and only took about 20 minutes, and the instructions were too simple for you to make any mistakes! Every piece was CLEARLY labeled, and went together without ANY problems. The only problem with this item is the ad is misleading. It's advertised as Oak, when actually it's wood composit (a*k*a Beaver Puke) with an Oak Veneer. Overall I'm pleased with the product, I just wish it would have been honest about being Oak Veneered beaver puke."
1,Piece of junk!,"An absolutely infuriating piece of junk - a waste of money and time spent trying to put this thing together. The ""wood"" splintered and broke when I tried to put the screws in - now I still have no storage plus I have to find room to throw out all the pieces to this junky thing. AVOID at all costs! I would give this ZERO stars if possible."
1,Worst Car Wash!!!,"I used this only once about a year ago and my car's finish has not been the same. It stripped all of the wax from my car and appears to have damaged the clear coat as well. I was shocked to find that I was left with a dull finish as soon as I rinsed it off!! My car looked worse than before I'd washed it! Ever since, I've tried various other washes and waxes (other brands) and the finish on my car was damaged so badly by Meguiars Deep Crystal Car Wash that I'm now looking into possibly having my car's clear coat re-done! What an expensive mistake!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Animal Cruelty for Entertainment!,"The American Humane Association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer ""No animals were harmed..."" (the registered trademark of the AHA) began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but I can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken!"
4,the man's an artist.,"If you're looking this far to find Mr. De La Rocha's material, you can't be too lazy.I have two words for you: GOOGLE and WIKIPEDIAAre these the end all be all of information? No. but it going to get you a lot closer than repeatedly typing ""what is it"" ""has anybody heard it"" ""why aren't you spoon feeding me?""So shut up, seaarch (you don't ever have to get up) and then you come back here (Amazon) and spend $$$."
5,The time is now zach,"I am sure that this album will continue to help add momentum to the currect neo-patriot movement. This corporate fascist wasteland of post-intellectual fallout is no longer acceptable. We cannot continue to float our lives away of the corporate slaveship. We need you zack....WAKE UP! the twin towers were a ""inside"" job I mean joke...I mean the voiceless need to speak in order for the world to hear the Truth.PAXCMAC"
5,Divinely Inspired,I enjoyed this book so much that I am purchasing several as gifts for loved ones. It touched me and resonated with my spirit as divinely inspired truth.
5,Children of Sanchez,"I remember seeing the Children first performed at Saratoga Springs, NY, in its entirety for the first time. It was magnificent. I had the recording on cassette and wanted to relive the memory on CD, since I threw the cassette away. The CD memory was just as good as the time I saw it. Loved it"
2,From mediocre to downright annoying!,"There were many classic records released by Blue Note in 1964. This, unfortunately, is not one of them. The ugly cover should have been a tip-off, but I was persuaded to part with my hard-earned paper to get this. The opening track is clever, but is extremely irritating. Hubbard's playing is fine throughout, but the compositions (with the exception of the final beautiful track by Joe Chambers) are abysmal. I concur with the assesment below - a big disappointment. This is a far cry from adventurous Blue Note classics like Wayne Shorter's 'All Seeing Eye (to which Hubbard contributes some fantastic playing), Andrew Hill's sadly underappreciated and out of print 'Compulsion' and Cecil Taylor's essential 'Conquistador!' and 'Unit Structures' (among others). In a word, on sale, it's a buy. Otherwise, avoid."
5,addicting,I tried this over a year ago when a foreign exchange student from Germany sent me a care package. I can no longer eat Kit-Kats because they taste like ashes compared to Duplo.Highly Recommend!
3,"Good Murnau film in parts, creaky in others","The great 1920's German film industry turned out fantastic productions with world class directors such as F.W. Murnau at the helm. This one has a great beginning that features still impressive special effects. The story, however, is a a morality tale steeped in medieval thinking (angels, devils, etc.). The middle part is quite dull and slow moving. I fast forwarded through this one."
4,I like this record!,"I know this album came out a long time ago, but it still get dismissed too much by the critics. I like it. I listen mostly to rock/hard rock, but there are times when I want to listen to melodic songs without power chords. Call it mood music if you wish, but as I once emailed Jeanette, I think female pop/rock songs sooth better at times and are fun to listen to. I am still exploring her music, and it has been fun watching her grow, especially the way she records music, all by herself, love it."
5,Great product!,"This product is a must have for anyone with a newborn! This would always help calm my baby down if she was fussy due to gas or upset tummy. Plus, it's easy to use and small enough to travel with. Great product."
3,It Just Didn't...,"live up to all its hype in my opinion. I mean, I had heard about this book for years before I read it, and once I did, it was just okay. I think the hot sex is what got this book over with so many folks, because the storyline is weak outside of that. Hell, I'm still trying to understand how, Zoe's father dying and her getting attacked on the way home from school as a little girl lead to her becoming a sex addict! I dunno, something in that just didn't flow for me."
2,"read it twice, by accident","It can't be a good thing that I was halfway through the book before I realized that I had already read the darn thing! I know a lot of mass market fiction can be interchangeable, but for the characters and plot to be so forgettable that it took me 100 pages before I realized it was all too familiar...that's crazy. Also, why couldn't the main character have a lot of sex simply because she loved it, not because she was molested as a child. It plays into the old stereotypes that the only women who have a voracious appetite for sex (aldultery, or not)must have been molested as children. When will women be allowed to love sex, simply because it feels good and it's wonderful?"
2,Addicted? Not exactly...,"I opened ""Addicted"" with high expectations and closed it high-and-dry, so to speak. I must say, Zane is terrific at creating atmosphere, for example the way Zoe and Jason met, their childhood escapades, etc. But Zoe's childish 'nuccas' and other curses (in front of her passive, middle class Black parents? puh-leese, i would have caught a beat-down!) and tantrums simply turn into adult tirades (I hate you! I just hate you!) when things don't go her way. Yet she's supposed to be an independent, successful business woman? Zoe is neither believable, nor likable, nor dispicable--just annoying. It takes more than erotic scenes to make a book engaging. Less cursing and exclamation marks and more meaningful moments between characters would have made this book more intense and powerful. This fiction squandered an opportunity to address --or even relate-- sexual addiction to real black women facing the issue. I recommend ""The Coldest Winter Ever"" by Sistah Souljah instead."
5,This is real!,This book was the truth and I could fully relate. I would never do the things that were listed but I understood the characters dilema entirely. Zane is a great writer and the twist and turns that she sent her character through proved how good she is. I really enjoyed this book and I couldn't put it down once I got started. I especially loved how she took you through the sex scenes as if you were actually living it. This was a romance as well as a thriller and it kept my attention throughout.
4,Awesome,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was another one of those books you just couldn't put down I finished it at 5:30a.m. For me it was relateable as far as searching outside your relationship for what it's lacking I know so many people who do that.
2,"THANK YOU, ally1queen2!!!!","For being one of the few people with an appreciation for WRITING!This book was pretty close to the bottom. I gave it 2 stars because the beginning story was OK. The rest was contrived, unrealistic (people don't speak this way in real life), and unbelievable. It's impossible to feel any sympathy for Zoe unless you yourself have no respect for anyone you love. All she thought about was herself,nothing else unless it threatened her selfish world. And truth be told, I think if some readers were really honest with themselves, they would have wanted to see a whole different ending... one without her. What is happening to literacy in this country???"
1,Too bad there is no 0 stars option...,"The story is the most predictable, the language is at fifth grade level, and an 'average customer rating' is four and a half stars?!! Something is wrong here... Anyway, don't waste your time on this book, pick something else."
5,what I expected,"I loved this book!! everyone let me know how many twists and turns, but I did not expect such a great layout. It's a page turner and doesn't end to the very last pages!!"
5,I was addicted to this book!,"This book was great! Zane is a wonderful writter, he really knows how to get a reader hooked! I managed to read this book in a couple of hours. The book had a great plot and was wonderfully written! I can't wait to read more by Zane!"
3,Unrealistic,"First of all, the reason why I'm giving this book 3 stars is because it was very interesting. However, the book was so unrealistic! (...) I'm sorry but as interesting as the storyline is, I just kept thinking I was watching a bad soap opera."
2,Amarteurish,"I've heard that Zane has written better books, so I guess I picked the wrong one to read first. This book was so amarteurish. It was as if Zane started dreaming up all kinds of criminal drama during the second half of the book to make up for the boring first half. Many of the criminal characters are not believable because Zane skims over them, and asks us to accept their actions without much character development. The book starts as a love story and suddenly turns into a crime novel. She also could have done better research on the use of hypnosis. Her description as really silly (a swinging watch)."
5,Attention grabber!,"This book definitely kept my attention. I finished it in 2 days and I loved it! It was so unpredictable. Everytime I thought I knew what was going to happen next, it surprised me. I will definitely be reading more books by Zane!"
3,It was just O.K....,"I was disappointed that this book was just ok, after reading such good reviews. I didn't think that she developed the characters as good as I would have liked. Some of the plot twists at the end made it interesting, but not very believable. There were quite a few violent scenes as well that I didn't think were necessary. I would give this book to someone if they wanted to read it, but I wouldn't recommend buying this book. Save your money for other good books out there..."
3,"Corny...Always has been, Always will be","This book would have been considered good if they fixed a few things. I can't stand the slang used in the book. Especially when she was an adult, the way she spoke made her sound like a kid instead of a professional businesswoman. I was told that it was going to be kinky. But the only kinkiness is her getting tied up in bed. The book was way too melodramatic. All of her lovers have intentions of murdering her. Another thing that bothered me is Zane's definition of a sexual addict. Having three lovers doesn't make you ""addicted"". If Zoe were a man with three lovers she would just be a plain old cheater. Seems Zane follows the sexist stereotypes that a woman is a deviant if she loves sex. A disappointment. Not worth all the raves I heard about."
4,Zero to 60!,"It was a very, very, very slow start. Took me longer than normal to get through the first few chapters....but once I got to the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down! I finished it up in one day. I was told there was a movie to this, but I couldn't find any information on that. (no release date)"
2,OK But have read better,"I give this book only 2 stars because it was an easy read. If the plot was around the addiction to sex, why were the sex descriptions so vague and boring. I wanted more depth from the charcters, but had to realize that this is a fiction based novel to say the least. The characters were really weak. A better read would be ""Anything Goes"" by Jessica Tilles. Zane should have taken some notes on how to give more juice to the sex scenes from Jessica. And for all of the ""Stop Hating"" crew, it's not hating it's called constructive critisism."
1,Worst book I've ever read,This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I was looking for a good read for my Thanksgiving break when I came across this title in Essence Magazine's top ten Fictional paperbacks.I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. The writing was very poor and the plot line was predictable. I could not connect with any of the characters and did not care what happend to them. Save your (...)4 dollars and pass (...)
5,I am Captured!!,"I just began my journey through african american litureture and I can tell you that most of the books people have told me are the ""bomb"" have turned out to be duds next to this book. Since I'm just getting into reading works by black authors I didn't know what type of book I liked but now not only have I found my favorite type of book but I've found my favorite author. This book has everything you'd need to keep your interest. Perfect beginning, twists that catch you off gaurd and make you dizzy, and a story that comes full circle and make perfect sense from beginning to end. It's also a storyline that I'm sure many of us, male or female, can identify with. This is a book I'd recommend to anyone who is into this type of reading, even my mother!"
3,Only okay,"I didn't care for this as a soup, as I found it too salty. But it works fine as a base for sauce if you experiment with adding other ingredients."
4,"really good, worth watching","On its own, this is a really good movie. If you compare it to Jet Li's best however, subtract one star. But is that really fair? All I know is that I enjoyed this movie from the lion dances, the introduction of Clubfoot, the fight on the oil-stained floor, and the cool opening credit sequence-featuring the Wong Fei-Hung theme. Technically, it is good as well. Nice performances, direction, camera angles, choreography, set design, two-way storyline, and just enough humor. I would've preferred more actual one-on-one kung fu in the finale, but the ending was still entertaining. Add this to your collection."
1,"Great for the eyes, a pain for the mind and ears.","Trying to describe the waste of time this film was would be more a waste of time than the film actually was. Another reviewer summed it up perfectly, it would be pointless for me to do the same. The worst offence? Violence is NEVER poetic."
1,hasnt worked for me so far !,i hv been using this product for over a month. no help rather hair loss has increased considerably. not sure if i shud continue using it . very disappointed.
4,Psychic Healing,"Not my favorite in this area, but still very good information for everyone interested in developing their intuition and self-healing skills. It's great not having to depend on barbaric Western medicine and surgeries, but to take more of an active part in healing oneself. I'd sure enjoy Diane's writing more if she would use more sections, sub-titles, etc. to make finding information easier."
5,long time user of excellent product,"Dona is the best. This is the only glucosamine product my Dr recommends because of the amount of research behind it. The pills are large but not humongous. I know it works because twice when I've had to postpone purchasing for a couple of weeks my osteoarthritis pain and stiffness noticeably increased. Shelf price is $40.I save about $10 (including shipping) when I buy on Amazon, sometimes more."
4,High level history review,"Heading to Europe this summer and decided I wanted a refresher on European history without digging out the old college text books. This is a good high level review that touches on the key time periods of European history. If you want something in depth, look elsewhere, if you have never read one of Rick Steves' books be forewarned, he does lace the book with his personal comments on everything from politics to society. There really isn't anything wrong with that but if you're expecting a text book style history book, this isn't it. For the casual traveler and those that just want a refresher, this is it."
5,added dimension to your european vacation,"If you forget your european history from college (or just wasn't paying attention in class), this book really helps bring your european destination to life. I think the difference between reading this book and then going on vacation versus going on vacation without the book is like looking at someone's photo album filled with people you've heard stories about or shared experiences with or looking at an album full of people you don't know and don't care about. I highly recommend reading it."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered two sets of these frames. One set is so poorly put together that the frames constantly slide out. The other one is slightly better but not much. I would not recommend this. It's cheap and poorly constructed, and I spend more time picking my pictures up off the floor than enjoying them."
4,Flying in the blind.,"Very technical story of Amelia's last flight. A lot of good information of communications technology of the day which required some research on my part to understand some of those aspects in the book. I came away believing Amelia had no business making this type of flight and now have doubts she was anything but a very average pilot for the day. This flight required a bunch more preparation then it appeared she had taken. Did she have life preservers or a life boat, we still don't know. I would have like to know if she or her navigator could swim. If the plane went down in sight of some land with no life preserver or raft and they couldn't swim it was certain death."
3,Unnecessarily heavy approach to dissecting Earhart case...,"It's without question that the author's exhaustive, well documented research makes for a ""case closed"" summation when it comes to the disappearance of the famed aviatrix. However, this extensive detail actually tends to get in the way of the compelling story. I found myself begin to skip over large passages of data in attempts to get back to the narrative of the Story. Perhaps because I don't have a head for figures/mathematics, but I kept wishing more of the information included had been, instead, relegated to the Appendix/Notes.Still, if you're interested in Earhart's biography, you will want to give this a read."
4,Wish this was written 8 years ago...,This book helps you get your perspective right. Illustrates how to shift gears from life's distractions to focus on what your kids really need from their dad. A great gift for a new dad.
2,Jack Lalanne'd diet book,The book was Okay but so simple I already knew the stuff in it.But We love his juicer and use it all the time.And we read his stuff on line.
4,$10.99 for 2 mats,The color is as pictured. I was surprised and delighted to find two in the package.
2,"Introductory, but no more.","For teenagers who know nothing of the Reagan years, this is a good introductory account from a second-tier Republican. For those of us who lived through them, it is a banal rehash on the level of the prose one finds in _Newsweek_ or _Time_. The insights are few, too. This reader's view is that the area in which Miss Noonan was involved, the drafting of speeches for the president, is at once trivial and overrated in importance, so I lament that this book will be many people's introduction to Reaganite (as distinguished from Reagoon or Reaganinnie) political thinking and activity; still, it's better than nothing."
4,A Pleasant Collection!,"This post-humous collection of Gram Parsons recordings was originally released in 1976 - 3 years after his death. 9 tracks are Flying Burrito Brothers recordings from early 1970 and 3 tracks were recorded during the ""Grievous Angel"" sessions. The 3 later tracks are duets with Emmylou Harris.There are no Parsons originals included. The Burritos were planning to record a whole album of ""pure and honest"" country music. Most tracks are pleasant, but nothing extraordinary.Parsons had a good voice for country music, but this collection does not give the answer to how he could become a legend in country-rock. There are some fine vocal harmonies with Chris Hilmann and with Emmylou Harris things rarely go completely wrong.Of the Burrito songs ""Sing Me Back Home"", ""Your Angel Steps Out of Heaven"" and ""Dim Lights"" are really good, and ""The Angels Rejoiced Last Night"" with Harris is the highlight of the album."
2,Don't buy for the external speakers,"I bought this for a friend. Based on the reviews on this site I expected that the sound would be OK. Sadly, it is about as good as an old transistor radio.Not surprising, given the size of the speakers, but I can't imagine why no one else commented on it. I'm returning it and getting a $65 portable and a set of external speakers."
3,Poor operating instructions,"I have has previous cd players (various brands) with programability, however that feature either never worked right or the operating insructions were impossible to figure out. This unit has excellant sound and antiskip but I gave up trying to figure out how to use the programming feature. An e-mail to the manufacturer for help was never responded to."
3,Good keyboard/remote but has some drawbacks,"The good:1)Works great with Media Center and as keyboard in general. IR receiver doesn't seem to have problems with the LCD screen or Wifi (Unlike Logitech\'s keyboards and mice)2)The remote functions are well placed. I find I use this more than the actual remote.The Bad:1) As others have noted the ""eraser"" mouse is almost unusable. I loved this style of mouse on Thinkpads but this one is awkward, requires too much downward pressure to activate and impossible to control even after adjusting speed etc...2) The keyboard is not recognized by the BIOS so it isn't usable for controlling the system at power on.I've kept the unit because as a keyboard it works. However I'm looking for a version with a trackball for the long term."
1,MISREPRESENTED KEYBOARD,"I am under the impression that I have been swindled: Microsoft on its packaging, and Amazon in its web writeup, announce this as a ""REMOTE KEYBOARD FOR WINDOWS XP MEDIA CENTER EDITION"".I have both a VAIO Laptop with XP Media Center Edition, and a PC with MS Media Center Edition, but neither will work with this Keyboard.The small print inside the box says I have to buy a 'MEDIA CENTER PC EQUIPPED WITH THE PROPER MS RECEIVER...!"" for this to connect to. Absolutely preposterous. Nowhere outside the box, nor in Amazon's desciption, is there a warning that this SEVERE limitation exists.So what do I do with this keyboard now?Can somebody supply me with a receiver I can connect to my PC?Or have I really been swindled?"
2,not good,"The mouse button is not very easy to use and my keyboard stopped working after 2 years(yes, i check the batteries)"
1,Sorry purchaser,"I searched for a home use product, this requires an adapter which I searched and searched for, no luck. It went out in the trash"
5,"An amusing, surprising account of writers as rockers.","When Stephen King, Dave Barry, Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Marsh and other famous authors formed an ad hoc rock band for a booksellers' convention, everyone--including them--saw it as a one-time lark. Their motto: ""We play music as well as Metallica writes novels."" But energized by the experience, and the fantasies and camaraderie it sparked, they decided to mount an East-Coast tour as The Rock-Bottom Remainders. In this book, each writer/musician? relates a chapter of the adventure from his or her own perspective. A lot of it is hilarious: most of Dave Barry's and Roy Blount, Jr.'s, contributions, for instance, as well as--surprise--much of Amy Tan's. But the book is also reflective, revealing, and at times surprisingly moving. This is a book for fans of any of the authors represented, for those curious about intersections of American pop culture, and for anyone who has ever dreamed of breaking out of the mold"
5,Very emotional.,SOme of the best guitar work ever laid down on vinyl. This CD features the late great Tommy Bolin (RIP). I first heard tracks from this LP years ago when two tracks appeared on a retrospective of Tommy Bolin. I was hooked and went and bought the CD. Just superb. Recommended for those people who loves guitars that speak without talking.
3,good and a half,"There is nothing wrong with Free Form--a solid album by the usually phonomonal Donald Byrd.Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter back Byrd here, and a lot of the music is not far from the inventive hard bop both were doing with Miles Davis. Hancock uses an electric panio, a move even far more conservative players made in 1969, as rock began to truely permiate jazz. There is also some freedom in the soloing.But Free Form does not contain the invention ofA New PerspectiveorBlack Byrd. It is good hard bop, not the leap forward the name of the album implies."
4,Second of Jane Roberts' trilogy,"If you have read Mary Marecek's previous book, ""Jane Roberts' A View From The Other Side"", this is the second installment of her planned trilogy. It is unfortunate that the editing was poorly done and many typographical and spelling errors went unchecked; however, if you can pass over that, the book is a true gem, especially for Jane Roberts' old fans. As we expand our awareness, we become multi-dimensional. This view confirms other statements made by Dr. Stanislav Grof, for example. We, the plants, the animals, the atoms and molecules, all share this living energy. As Castaneda said, we are all equal."
5,****Museum of all Museums****,"Even though this older book does not include the new addition to the Louvre, doesn't mean it's useless. If you've ever walked for almost miles without a guide perhaps you will agree with me when I say, you need this book. Dated a little but less expensive than a new one and it's just as informative."
4,Composers Never Fade Away,I already knew of this artist and title back when I was 18 years old. The album had already been released and was shopping at a local Radio Shack and heard Mangione Live at the Hollywood Bowl on a reel to reel tape deck. The CD even sounds better
3,Good book until the weak ending,"I find that many contemporary novelists have problems with character development. Greenwood does not have this problem and created an interesting (and realistic) mix of characters for this novel. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and conflict development. Anyone who cannot follow with the time changes in the novel should not read anything above the junior high level (this is not an issue and is certainly not as involved to follow as something like ""The Sound and the Fury"" or ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"". However, while the sexual tension between the characters is well developed, it is not adequately resolved. As a result, the ending is a let down."
3,"skip-free cd, but radio not so great","I bought this player and was satisfied with the cd portion. Jogging produced no skips, this impressed me. The radio was not so great, with this device I could not get stations I got on my recently deceased walkman. This was disappointing, because there are so few players with radios at all. This was not worth the extra money.The other point worth mentioning is that the headphones that came with it were designed by a torture expert and had horrible sound. Don't give up on this cd player until you try it with decent headphones."
2,CD quality sound????,"I purchased this CD player and was highly disappointed. I have an old minidisc player that I purchased 4 years ago and it was getting old. It was one of the MD players that didn't have 40 second anti skip protection. Thus, the reason why I was looking for a CD with 40 s protection. Anyway, when I listened to the quality of the CD player, I was very disappointed. I compared it to my old minidisc player and the MD player blew it away. My wife also agrees with me. I just found out that Amazon.com also sells MD portable players. Boy did I feel like an idiot. As a result, I am returning this poor quality player, and upgrading to a 40 s protection MD player. For those of you thinking about getting a portable CD player, the MD players blow them away.... big time! For those picky people that get chills whenever they hear high quality sounding music, Go for the portable MD players.Peace out!ej"
5,BLAKEY'S BEST,"THIS IS ONE TRULY GREAT RECORDING, WITH A GREAT BAND. CURTIS FULLER, WAYNE SHORTER, FREDDIE HUBBARD, CEDAR WALTON, REGGIE WORKMAN. WOW! AND ART BLAKEY IS ON FIRE. IF YOU ENJOY LISTENING TO THE HARD BOP SOUND, THEN THIS ALBUM IS A MUST-HAVE FOR YOU. ANOTHER GREAT BLUE NOTE RECORDING FROM THE EARLY 60'S............."
4,Everything works together for the good...,"This is a really great album. I highly recommend it. It's not flashy or overdone; it's just mellow rock with honest and heartfelt lyrics, the kind of music you can listen to at any time, however you are feeling. If you are sad, this music will help lift your spirits up and remind you of what's important, to always be ""living for the Lord."" He has visited my church several times as a guest artist, and he is great live, too!"
1,Stopped Reading at Chapter Nine,"When reading a book, I always make sure I have enough time in the day/evening to finish it (otherwise it's constantly on my mind the next day or until I finish it). However, this book was an exception. I stopped reading at chapter nine...and forced myself to finish it a few days later. Linda Howard has been a favorite of mine and I am slowly collecting her books. This one won't be staying in my collection. The flap review made it sound decent and entertaining.""Smart-talking"" Nikita - wouldn't really be the way I would describe her. Sure she had a few cute lines...but ""Smart-talking"" indicates quick wit and sarcasm. Didn't see much of that. Knox - I could have connected with Knox if he had been placed in a different book with a different plot and with a different female. Otherwise, without the support of a good herione, he kinda fell flat which was disappointing because I could have liked him...."
2,NOT UP TO PAR!,"Usually, Linda Howard does great work; her last 2 have been really great disappointments, however; first with one written in 1st person was really a downer; however, did manage to follow the audio bk. This last one was really hard to get into for me; the audio was even unappealing. The very best she has done in a long time has been, KISS ME WHILE I SLEEP; oh, for more on these lines!"
1,killing time,"i never thought i would ever say this, but this book sucks. Don't waste ur money and time as i did mine. if this is ur first time reading one of her books get mr. perfect or something else but not this one."
2,Not the best but still entertaining,"OK people, I wont go through the whole review thing with youyou already have an idea what is going on with this book. I didnt think this was Linda's best book, it couldnt hold my attention. But I love Linda, and will allow this error, the lady hasnt ever let me down before.But I dont understand why some readers believe Knox is an obnoxious alpha male, I thought he was rather tame. Honey if you think he is jerkish then you need to read the male characters in Shannon McKennas books, all those male characters have issues. Knox is a kitten compared to them.This book was luke warm but Ill still continue reading Linda."
2,Something Is Missing,"Linda Howard has deviated from her normal Romantic Suspense to try a Sci-Fi/Time Travel/Romantic Suspense. Knox Davis is a police investigator for the Pekesville, KY. in 2005. A time capsule is mysteriously unearthed at the court house and no clues are left. At the same time Nikita Stover comes to town, she is an FBI agent from 2207. The two join forces to stop rogue agents from stealing the information left in the capsule.Too much is occurring in this story. Trying to cover the social and technological changes in 200 years, plus the mystery and romance, means that plot and characters are not fully developed. I have enjoyed Howard's Open Season, Mr. Perfect, & Dream Man but this one left me cold. If you want to read a great time travel romance by Ms. Howard try Son of Morning. You will become involved with the characters and the plot is exacting."
3,Lukewarm but entertaining,"I'm a Linda Howard fan, but this book was bad because he writing was off, the story started slowly and the ""love"" between Knox and Nikita comes out of nowhere. On the other hand, I really dig the concept, futuristic gadgets and the future Ms. Howard envisions, plus the ending was perfect and -maybe I'm a mush, I don't care- the book made me happy. As far as I'm concerned, that's all I need from this author."
1,Wow....,"I was so disappointed in this book. I was so excited and just waiting for the release date and as much as I love Linda Howard it was such a waste of time and money. So, dont waste your money...just go to the library and check it out. :)"
1,"I love Linda Howard, but this was boring!","I basically could not get through this book, even listening to it on tape. Howard is one of my favorite authors, but this book just didn't do it for me. I personally would suggest by-passing it and waiting for her next one to come out."
5,"Excellent, as usual","Linda never fails to deliver excellence and ""Killing Time"" is another winner. Thank you Linda. You never let us down."
2,Disappointed.,"I love Linda Howard when she's good and I usually like time travel romance. This book left me cold. The hero, a police detective, was dull, --meticulous and somewhat clinical. The heroine was an FBI agent from the future who repressed her feelings. The fireworks didn't fly between them. At one point, she punches him and really whacks his chin, which didn't seem any more attractive than when a man punches a woman. The hero is amused by her misunderstandings of today's idioms, but these weren't very clever for the most part. I liked some of the technology, but it wasn't that amazing. The heroine's fascination with cotton clothing was kind of a yawner. I look forward to a better book from this author next time out."
2,Not as good as the original Nikon one,"It doesn't last as long. Maybe half as long if that. But after over 3 years, it still works."
2,Kate Millet Flying,"Kate, you need an editor for your book. I do not enjoy ""stream of consciousness"" style of writing but more than this, the book is disorganized and lacks simple punctuation, needs lots of organization. I get the idea about your pace of life and the workings of your mind in daily life. The book gives the reader a real feel in this regard.Your political leanings are clearly stated as is your emotional and sexual life albeit scattered throughout the book. Kudoos for holding nothing back. You are an honest author.Flying"
5,Great for both beginners and pros!,"I'm in 11th grade and have played the piano for 10 years. I've performed at the Lincoln Center in New York City and have accompanied many musicals. Having said that, I realized that I knew everything about music - except the theory behind it. I began looking on the internet for a music theory book and this is the one I found. I was a little hesitant about buying it because some reviews stated that it was for beginners only. I bought this book anyways and yes, the first third of this book is the basics - tempo, dynamics, time and key signature, ect. But this book has so much more (and the beginning section serves as a great reference when you need to know how to count 9/4 time and stuff like that). This book has everything I wanted and more in it from building chords, writing music, following a lead sheet, and directing music. It is a great resource that I think every musician should have sitting on there bookshelf.Bravo Mr. Miller"
5,Really Easy to Understand Book,My husband has been playing guitar at a pretty beginner level off and on for years. He really wanted to get more knowledge on music theory. A friend recommended this book to him. It has been wonderful. It has really improved his guitar playing and song writing. It explains everything very clearly and in depth. He would definitely recommend this to all beginners.
2,poorly written introduction to music,"While the content of this book is appropriate, the text is sometimes misleading, confusing and vague.I do not recommend this book. Edly's is much better."
4,Great Theory Basics Book!,"Mr. Miller has done a great job presenting music theory in a way that many people who are not college music students may enjoy and understand the concepts better. There are a few incorrect explanations in atleast one area: rhythms. On p. 59 a commmon mistake of ""four quarter note rests"" is mentioned. Either you can have four quarter notes OR four quarter rests; not both. The other is on p. 68 where the ""Eighth-Note Time Signatures"" show 'beats per measure' incorrectly. EX: In 6/8 time, there are 2 beats per bar, not 6. This is a common misconception among some students due to the fact that compound meter is more difficult to grasp, being subdivision of 3 instead of 2. Overall, I feel this is a good book and presented in a friendly and not ""so dry"" a manner as many texts on the subject are presented. Miller's use of musical examples in popular music and classical are quite nice as well. Great job!"
4,educativo,"ameno y sencillo en sus explicaciones y ejemplos, de grandes consejos y sugerencias, requiere dedicación y empeño para sacarle provecho"
3,It could be much better,"The book is good but if you don't read music or have an understanding of what the notes on staff sound like it is hard to understand what the author is trying to teach. The Everything Music Theory book, on the other hand, has sound clip examples with the CD that follows the book, teaching you what a major or minor chord/scale sounds like. In my opinion, this book really misses that opportunity...because if you have at least a basic understanding of music you would not be picking up a book with the term ""complete idiot"" in the title."
2,Severely Lacking,"In the 2008 installment, EA blew it. For PS3 there is no 2 player mode. Certainly the racing is semi realistict, but w/o 2 player, how can you have fun with your friends. Honestly, I returned my to FYE and convinced them to sell me the PS2 make so I can at least do 2 Player with my friend. EA needs to get back to basics like that of Nascar 04."
2,HugeDdisappointment,I agree with many of the other negative reviews and won't bore you with repeating them. The main reason I'm going to resell this game is that it's 1 player unless you are playing online! Absolutely no use for a game configured this way.
1,don't bother!,"I wish I would have taken heed of the reviews written here & not purchased this. But I gave in to my son, who REALLY wanted it. He doesn't want it anymore though, because the thing doesn't work! Oh sure, little Thomas huffs & puffs away at first - but after a minute or two of play, game's over. And Thomas doesn't really ""join"" with Annie & Clarabel - it's a magnet. It's cute but it doesn't work the way it claims it does and therefore it is definitely a complete and total rip off!"
4,Good storyline....Bad Camara Footage,"This movie is quite tight. this sh** keeps it real for most part but just exagarates about how ""bad"" Master P was/is. But is basicly acurate. Every seen in this movie is tight its more than good enough to rent this is a ""classic"" that needs to be owned on your ""Hall of Fame"" movie collection shelf. The only bad part is it looks like they filmed it with a home video camara with the poor film quality and some bad camara angles. (NEEDS TO BE REMASTERED ON DVD!)"
2,Bout It was okay for a person like Master P to make it!,It was ok cuz my dawg Mia X was in it! And my baby Silkk the Shocker!!! But over all it was ok.
2,Not Really,This movie was okay. Not much of it was real because of all that killing he did in the movie. If that was true he would be doing some hard time in jail. It was okay but a little boring like the rest of his movies I just have to give it a two because it was not all that.
4,only 4 stars because of the price,great walkman but why 200 i just simply cant afford that right now i wish i could but the sellers here want to much money
4,Used for parts,On its own this figure isn't great. The head is too pale and the hair doesn't look like it parts right.I used this figure for parts for a custom Carth Onasi figure I made. It actually makes a great Carth if you repaint the jacket orange. I recommend using the Kyle Katarn for the head.
5,Great product!,"I've been using this for over a year now, and I love it. It protects hair nicely from a straightening iron and gives it a beautiful shine without being heavy or leaving a yucky residue."
3,Tinny Speaker,"A decent starter tv at a good price. Speaker is below par and picture isn't as good as the RCA Colortrac which it replaced. Still, I bought mine on line at Sears during a one day sale for 69.99 so I can't complain too much as the RCA cost twice as much."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I have read the reviews about how well this works, RIDICULOUS. When I bought the first Kindle, early on, I was surprised how NOT functional the cover was, so sure I am of Amazon and the owner, I wrote and asked for a replacement cover because this was obviously a flawed design. I got no answer, no new cover and NEVER use this one except when i am storing the Kindle for travel. It is worthless as a holder....WORTHLESS."
1,Worthless item,"I wish I could say that I like this cover, but I don't. My Kindle will not stay in it. I am really not even sure what it is suppose to do, other than protect it while it is closed."
1,not good,I bought this thinking that it doesn't come with the purchase of Kindle. now I have 2 and absolutely useless. Kindle keeps on coming out from it as it doesn't have corners on all four sides. I have dropped it once already but now I have purchased another case by M.Edge.
1,"This is junk, not worth purchasing, Your Kindle will not fit correctly and you will find that it is easier not to use the cover.","Junk, do not purchase. Poor fit that allows the Kindle to fall out of the cover. You will find that it is better NOT to use the cover. This is the second cover that I have purchased for this Kindle; the first one had the metal clips that would NOT hold the Kindle to the cover. Why do they market JUNK? Do not purchase and I would recommend not to purchase covers or other products online-you want to inspect the quality and fit."
2,"Adequate, not more","The cover barely contains the Kindle.. the inner corners are at odd angles and a tiny bit too small to house the device. The elastic strap partialy covers the screen, I have to constantly move it to see the letters on the right side of the screen.It is nice looking and the quality of the materials is quite good.. it just does not fit as well as it should.. but what can you expect for the low price."
1,book cover,"I returned this book cover because it was totally inadequate-the kindle just DOES NOT stay attached securely. Unfortunately, they charged me a restocking fee which I feel was unjust since the product did not do what it was supposed to (i.e. hold the kindle securely)"
4,Used this since 2008 and have no problems,"I've had this since I got my Kindle. It works great, no problems. It's like anything else, use it the way it's intended."
4,Good cover,"The kindle cover is a fine cover and worthy of far better reviews than most are giving it. It works as prescribed for me and I have needed no tricks like velcro, etc. My kindle is secure and has never fallen out. The back cover also has never been caused to come off from this cover. After about two weeks of use it actually got better and better as it sort of melded to my kindle. I love it. The design could be improved upon yes, but I hear there are flaws with those other, more expensive covers as well."
3,Replacement Book Cover,"It woud appear that the cover of the kidle ( which I LOVE) just has it's quirks. The replacement that you sent was no different, and in fact I am looking for the original as it doesn't fall out as often as the new one.If that were my only problem then I would consider myself lucky.I am sorry that you had to take the time to send my a new one but I do appreciate the willingness and speed with which you replaced it. If I do find my original, I will be more than happy to send you back the replacement."
1,Please discover a new cover!,There has to be a better design for a cover! The cover that came w/ my Kindle is in no way a match for the great product it cradles. It slips loose with nearly every tilt and access to the on/off switches on the back requires an awkward juggling of the unit. Can anyone from the Apple product design group help????
1,WRONGO,"It doesn't matter how good it is, it's listed as fitting 1st generation and it doesn't. My guess would be that it fits the newest one. We have to return it and go through that hassle. There don't seem to be many, if any, for the older models which is very frustrating."
1,MISLEADING INFO,"I purchased this item as a cover for the Kindle2 that I ordered at the same time. The cover was listed as an accessory, but does not fit yhe Kindle2. I am disappointed in either your lack of clarity or product evaluation."
1,Very Disapointed,"I agree with what all the negative reviews say. I love my kindle, hate the cover.Overall: You'd be nuts to spend money on this cover but for the price (included with the kindle) how much can I complain... oh look quite a lot ;-)Negatives:1. If you are trying to read the kindle falls out of the cover2. To turn the kindle on and off you have to take it out of the case3. The small corners don't seem to fit the kindle correctly4. The quality of the materials is poor... feels very cheap to hold a $400 product.Positives:1. When not reading the kindle, it's not bad.2. Once closed the kindle does feel protected.3. The elastic band, though cheap looking, does stay nice and tight.Hopefully someone will come out with something much nicer that this in the future."
3,Sherlock Holmes goes to war,"Universal Studios enlisted Sherlock Holmes's aid against the Nazis when it made the unfortunate decision to update him to contemporary times rather than leave him in the Victorian era. Instead of the classic deerstalker, he sports greasy hair and a men's jacket of the time, which detracts from the iconic image with which so many viewers are familiar. The result is a middling propaganda piece about a Nazi saboteur that has a nice visual flair, yet suffers from the change of era. Somehow, fog-bound 1940s London is just not as romantic as fog-bound 1880s London. As always, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are wonderful in the lead roles, although it remains difficult to understand why Holmes would burden himself with such a dim-witted Watson. The theme of a shadowy terrorist causing death and havoc in the homeland resonates eerily with the concerns of today."
5,"What do you get when you take the ""V"" out of lives?","Zach's Lie is one of my favorite books because it teaches you that lies can get you into big trouble and even life threatening truble like Zach's did. This books reading level is about for fourth graders through eighth graders. It has about 240 pages in it. If you like adventurouse and mysterious books, you will like Zach's Lie. If you have a reletive who likes to read, you should get Zach's Lie for them. They'll love it."
5,Great Book,Zachs lie was the book ive been searching for. It was a great book and kept me reading from start to finish. Roland Smith did a great job writing the book and it was a great read. I definitely recommend this book to people of all ages.
5,The THRILLING Zachs Lie,"Jack Osbourne has almost found himself in a dream, although he wishes it all were one. As soon as he finds out that his father is an illegal drug seller and there is a group of men trying to kill his father, as well as him, his mother, and sister everything changes. While their father is in a prison , also for safety from these murderous men, Jack , and the rest of his family have to leave their hometown, change identities , and start a whole new life without ever telling anybody who they really are. They just have to Lie. Them being under the witness protection program, they have certain boundry's and are under cover. Join the chase to see if Alonzo and his henchmen find the real Jack Osbourne and family. And all the thrilling, suspenseful things that happen."
2,wanted to like it more,"I read all the reviews and I wanted it to be better, more enjoyable. I really forced myself to finish it. If I had checked it out of the library, I may have not even gotten past the first 50 pages. But I bought it since it was so critically praised and sounded like a book I would like. Sorry, I wanted to care about these people. I wanted to be shocked about what was really going on. But I just never really cared about any of the characters. I never really cared how the relationships worked out. I'd have to give it a C minus, but, hey - what do I know!"
3,Fantastic...until the end,"I absolutely loved the character development, the contrasting personalities, the incomplete narrator's viewpoint, with other information slipping into place from other sources. I really enjoyed the main character and all the others. The definitions and diagrams are quirky, highlighting the partiality of each person's viewpoint. But I was so desperately disappointed by the ending. I felt it had nothing at all to do with the rest of the book, either in style or quality. I felt as if something drastic happened in the author's life and she took it out on the book. I loved the first three-quarters so much I felt like writing to the author to ask her to write a second ending, it was such a shock. I wasn't looking for a happy ending, just something with the same mastery and heart as the rest of the book. Please write more books though Ms Cadwalladr!"
4,This is the same album as the other...,"This collection is best mixed with other music, as other reviewers have mentioned. To listen to this straight through would be rather monotonous -- not to dissuade a fan of Rose Melberg from buying this album, but it's all thematic. Still essential for anyone who enjoys The Softies or Rose's other work.I took the plunge, really wanting the one listed as sold out on Amazon's site, since there's no indication how many tracks this CD has... this IS the same CD, a compilation of all of Go Sailor's EPs... You're welcome!"
