3,Not what I expected,"Not really what I was expecting.Based on the length and the sketches, it appears to have been written for a youth audience, and yet it is written in a very formal style and language that I can see appealing to the youth reader.I felt like the books spent so much time describing scenery and details of the main character's travels that it did not invest enough time in building the chill of the ghost story.I did think that the few actual encounter scenes were well written. I just wish there had been more. I also felt the ending was a bit abrupt.I am looking forward to seeing the movie. The previews already seem way creepier than the actual book."
3,More could have been made...,"This is a typical ghost story. It has one little plot twist that's unexpected. I won't give this twist away, but I wish the author would have made the twist far more of a plot point and introduced it earlier in the story. The book would have more intreguing. That said, the story is good. The book is short and easily readable in an afternoon. The story is not particuarly ""scary"" meaning even young adolescents could read it and not be kept awake due to nightmares. This is one of those extremely rare instances, when a film of the story would most probably be more frightening, more sinister than the book. There's not enough description of what terrrorizes Mr Kidd or why he's still frightened later in life."
2,Mildly disappointing ...,"This is more of a novella than a novel. It has wonderfully whimsical illustrations which add to the sense of the book as a reproduction of an older tale & maybe that's the problem.I really love a good ghost story, but this just didn't do it for me. I found the writing to be mannered to the point of distraction & the story to be a cliched set piece with nothing new to add to the genre.I wanted to be scared by this book, but the ghostly happenings are just so predictable - the woman in black with the wasted face that pops up all over, the deserted house in the marsh that no one will visit, the ghostly sounds of pony trap & chair, the callow narrator's journey from youth to experience, etc., etc., etc.I really like this author, but this isn't one of her better outings. I'd like her to write as herself & not in imitation of others."
2,Confusing Ghost Story,"Our book club read this book as a Halloween ""Treat"". However, we all agreed that it was more of a ""Trick"". The ending was telegraphed from the beginning and speaking of telegraphs we were all confused as to the time period. Originally we thought it was being told from a Victorian perspective looking back 20+ years. Imagine our surprise when an automobile was introduced into the story."
2,Where's the color?,"Upon finding this book on Amazon, I was estatic!...having been a child of the 70's, but when I went ""inside"" the book was in black & white!. What a disappointment. I hope the author will consider re-releasing it in color, he would sell more copies."
3,Were the Sears catalogs in color?,thought for sure that the catalogs were almost all black and white.not sure if all the bad non color reviews are correct..
2,he gives alot,i've liked some of his songs but i never thought he was the second coming of anybody.he writes well and has a good group but in no way is he the next dylan.in fact the hits only goes for the highest chart positions as opposed for his best songs.that alone smells of $.
3,So-So...,I must say that I was hoping for more of his popular songs. It's not bad if you get it cheap.
3,What about the first two albums?!!?,"I'll never understand the logic of putting new songs--FOUR new ones on this disc!!!--on a greatest hits collection. Shouldn't greatest hits be, by definition, songs that we know? Plus, the exclusion of songs like ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""Incident on 57th Street"" is a crime. Otherwise, it's good."
3,Revised Greatest Hits,"I have an idea for this album in lieu of WalMart's. Keep the first eleven cuts as is and add Tunnel of Love and the following songs from the new century- The Rising, Radio Nowhere, Last to Die, Working on a Dream and Kingdom of Days. If you want to make it eighteen cuts as it is now you could add Prove It All Night early on. That leaves an eighteen song set that never lets up and does justice to his new music. Jon Landau are you out there?"
3,"Good introduction, but...","...there are too many hits missing, and the sound quality isn't always so good (the early tracks have not been remastered). It would be great if Columbia Records made ""The Essential Bruce Springsteen"" as a doubleCD set, featuring all the missing tracks (""I'm on fire"", ""Nebraska"", ""Darkness on the edge of town"", ""Jungleland"" etc.) plus ""The ghost of Tom Joad"", ""I wanna be with you"", ""Sad eyes"" and something from ""The Rising""."
3,Could Have Been Better,"There is nothing wrong with the material on here. It's good but there is so much missing. I know with a single disc it is hard to hit all the high points of an artist like The Boss. My complaint is there is too much ""Born In The USA"" (which I consider one of Bruces weakest records even though it was his commercial high point). There is only one track from ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" which is arguably his greatest album ever. Also only one track from his masterpiece ""Nebraska"". But 5 tracks from ""BITUSA! Plus 3 previously unreleased songs to close out the album. Nothing wrong with these three songs but why not include ""Promised Land"", ""Cadillac Ranch"" and ""One Step Up"" instead. As I said there is nothing really wrong with the music on here it is just a little post 1984 heavy."
2,You know how it goes,"It is true. You'd be much more pleased buying a Boss album than this. Imagine a video of the greatest scenes from the greatest movies. It'd be a mere novelty because everything would be out of context. Like it or not, Bruce always makes concept albums. There is little to link the songs on this effort except their recognizability. I happen to like ""Secret Garden"", but please do yourself a favor, beyond everything else, and buy ANY of his normal albums. Have a couple beers and ""prove it all night"". You will find so many gems left off this collection, as the above reviews are quick to point out (Racing in the Streets, Downbound Train, etc.)"
3,"Eh, not good enough","For the most important songwriter to emerge since the days of Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, one would think a 70 minute ""Greatest Hits"" would be in order, including some of his more varied material. The songs are strong, for the most part, though some lose their power outside the thematic contexts of his albums. I would quibble with some of the selction--dump most of the stuff at the end (there's a reason he didn't put it on ""Born in the USA"" in the first place) in favor of the likes of ""Spirit in the Night,"" ""Rosalita,"" or ""Darkness on the Edge of Town."" Like any greatest hits album of an artist of his stature and longevity, it is unsatisfactory--can you imagine trying to summarize Bob Dylan or the Beatles in a single disc? It can't be done--and neither can it be done with Springsteen."
2,A horror book that fails to break new ground,This was a bargain-bin book and it met my expectations. I did finish it but I had initially given up towards the end. Although this story was written in 1989 it could easily have been written decades before that. There were no new ideas within the covers and it felt like it was set in a 60s/B-Movie sort of film. The characters seemed very thin and based on stereotypes. The storyline based around the passing down of the Book of the Dead was pretty bland - it would probably make an OK film because the director could add flesh to the story that isn't really here. The author's descriptive ability didn't bring this tome to life! This is very average fare.
3,Story,"I really love the kindle app on my iPod touch. I've read Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm many times, and liked the idea of a continuation of the story, especially because it's free! I wasn't really thrilled with the story, it seemed more ""choppy"" than the first book. But it was free, so I can't really complain."
2,It stinks!,"I just received this yesterday and used it for the first time last night. Oh, it smells. It is heavily scented, and I can't for the life of me - in a time when everyone is going back to natural, organic and unscented - figure out why they loaded up a product for use on your face with so much fragrance. And it's floral. Ick. If it were lemon or peach... maybe. But old lady floral? I kept getting whiffs of it as I was trying to fall asleep. I'm not sure that I can use this product long enough to give my honest opinion of whether it works.I will try it again tonight, using less than last night, and applying with a tissue (I could not wash the flower smell from my hands). The things we do for beauty! :)"
4,Not as good as the Micro-sculpting cream,"Good product. Feels good on skin, not oily at all. Have been using it for years now and am happy with it."
2,not for sensitive skin,"I had a very bad reaction to this cream. I never considered my skin to be sensitive until after I used this product. I was really excited after reading reviews on night creams. This product seemed to have really good reviews and not bad for the price. After my first application my skin seemed softer and very moisturized. I was really happy. However after the second application the next morning my skin began to look a little red around the cheek bone area. After the third application it was nightmare. My skin was bright red in multiple places and my I had a full acne break out. (normally i get a pimple here and there, nothing major) It was horrible. My face hurt. It's been 2 weeks and my skin still is not back to normal. If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product."
1,overwhelming fragrance,"The flowery odor was so strong, I had to wash it off immediately. I find that Olay fragrances vary from product to product. This one will be thrown out."
3,Too much fragrance.,This product has a very strong perfumey fragrance that I don't like at all. The color is also a little off-putting (grayish/purple) but I can live with that. I have very senstive skin and can't use something with so much fragrance. I switched to Loreal Deep Set Wrinkle Night Cream and am much happier with it.
4,"I like it, but I'm waiting for better wrinkle improvement on neck","I've been using the product for 4 weeks. I really like what my skin looks and feels like now. I got the day and night cream and haven't been consistent about using the night cream on my neck especially, but I will say I like it and will buy again. I have very sensitive skin and have had no rashes or breakouts."
3,"For modelers, rather than for historians","In the usual Campaign series format, highlights from the book are the topological maps in 3D and the uniforms and equipment sketches. (These drawings actually come from other Osprey series, such as WARRIORS, MEN AT ARMS, or ELITE.)The historical treatment is not too deep (the book isn't that long!) but gives a nice overview of the whole lightning campaign.There is some extra material for wargamers at the end, but, as said, the main users of this book will be modelers (as I am!)."
3,Hard to read display.,"I purchased this for my 9 year old son as a Christmas gift. Although, he says that he loves the watch, it is very hard to read the display in normal conditions. Otherwise, it's is a nice watch with good functionality. The water resistance of 50M is good, too."
4,Instructions need help,It is a great watch- but the instructions included on how to set it were difficult to understand. I hate to admit it but I had to ask for help from my husband.
3,Pay attention buying,"For a person that really like an sportive watch, its a cool item, but the picture that shows it is not the really design of the watch...I just thought that would be a bigger one but no.."
3,Good but ....,I had been hoping for more color pictures rather than many being black and white. Still good artwork!
5,"""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" is more than a kid movie","One of my teacher's boyfriend works for Dreamworks, so on the last day of school they handed out soundtracks from Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron! Anyway, the songs on this CD really represent the characters, especially, ""Get Off My Back"". This is definately a kid's movie, but it can mean alot to an adult, especially with the entire ""punk"" theme in Spirit as he fights for his freedom."
5,Wonderful!,This was a great purchase for me. My daughter wanted it for Christmas and I went to several different stores and was unable to find it. It came quickly also.
2,Spirit: Stallion of the Cimerron,Would have much preferred just the music. Bryan Adams should have left the gravel voice to Rod McKewin. No doubt the lyrics aided in the telling of the movie but they just do not stand alone. Don't waste your money on this one if it is only attractive because of Hans Zimmer reputation
4,John Cusack: A showcase of his talent and range,"Don't miss this great performance by John Cusack because you've heard this is an anti-war film. It isn't.I had expected a storyline along the same lines ofIn the Valley of Elah. This isn't the case. This movie is about a husband's grief and loss. The relationship between Cusack's character and his two daughters is painful and riveting.Fans of John Cusack will appreciate his subtle work here. I also recommend his other recent drama,Martian Child.And Clint Eastwood fans should take note that he composed the musical score and title song for ""Grace is Gone.""Be ready to dry your eyes."
4,It's really great,"I am a Dawson's creek fan from Israel. I think this CD (which I had to buy in Germany) is pretty good. It has good songs like ""superman"" (06), ""just another"" (12) and of caurse ""daydream believer"" (14). As a DC fan I was disappointed when they didn't put songs like ""that I would be good"" by alanis and ""papercup"" by heather nova, but they picked good unknown songs that can make your day very happy - and it's great to be heard during a long trip. I recomend you buy it even if you don't watch the show - because it has nice tunes from all varietys of music."
4,"That ""say goodbye say goodnight"" song is...","...entitled ""Don't Say Goodbye, Say Good Night"" by Binocular...excellent song no?Gotta love this cd...especially Spledor's ""I Think God Can Explain""....the PERFECT heartbreak song! :)"
2,Overused chiq bubblegum,I bought thic CD without listening to it(big mistake) it's sappy chick music with a few dance-ish songs. Dawson's could find a much better collection of songs.
4,The Australian version rocks!,"I have the Australian version of this CD at home. The Australian version contains 4 extra tracks (by Australian artists). Now, I have to be honest here, the 4 extra tracks are the best tracks on the whole album. It's a little sad that the USA customers were deprived of these excellent songs.Anyway.. I give the Australian version 5 stars, and the USA version 4 stars."
4,A must for any DC fan!!!!!,"This is all the best songs from Dawsons Creek in Season 4. Any DC fan will appreciate it. If you own Songs from Dawsons Creek Vol. 1 then it'll seem familiar to you. There are 14 tracks all pure dawsons creek, by various artists, some popular some unheard of. It's a good chance to explore some great artists who you would otherwise probably not hear. It is definately worth listening to and even non dawsons creek lovers will enjoy the good mix of brilliant music. Give it a try!"
2,Not engaging,"I have read several of the series of books. They are O.K., but not as inspired, and not the least bit as engaing as the Harry Potter series. This movie however, doesn't do the books justice. The ambiance is darkly contrived, Carey is WAY over the top, the children don't seem as likable or as capable as the books characters, and all in all, not one I would see again. The very best part of the books is the vocabulary definition comedic touch, and the movie takes a whack at introducing that, but it is half-hearted and soon abandoned."
4,Good but the books are better!!,When I got this I thought I would like the books better and well I was right. Don't get me wrong it was good but it was hard to follow if you didn't read the books. Defintely read the books before watching.
2,A Pointless and ridiculous story!,"After ""Me, Myself & Irene"" this was the worst Jim Carey movie I've ever seen. although this is not completely a Jim Carey movie, but they sold it under the name of Jim Carey! the story was pointless and specially ridiclulous at the end. only two good scenes were in the movie, first the train scene and second, the storm scene! these scene were really worth to be watched on the big screen. Children may love this movie cause it's based on one of their favorite books, I've never read that book but some said it's much better than the movie. Let me suggest you something, if you've liked this movie, so enjoy it, buy this really good collector's edition pack, but if you only want to buy it for your beloved children, there is a cheaper single disc edition! cause this movie does not worth to pay 25 dollars even for a such brilliant 2 disc collector's edition DVD!"
3,The Movie is Always Worse,"This is an o.k. movie. Some of the parts are really touching and make you think, but they were just better as books! Being my favorite book series, the only complaint I have about Unfortunate Events is how depressing it is. Of course, you can tell it's not going to be cheerful just by the title, but the movie makes it even more depressing with the wonderful score. I didn't like how they crammed three books into one movie. It's okay, but it's just not the same as the books."
4,Looks good,"I was just watching Kids Choice Awards 2004,and then....BAM!!! I saw the preview.It looked great.I beat the other people[only 2] in a race we were doing with the books.They were great.I have a complaint that Klaus is taller than Violet.I think Jim Carrey will make a great Count Olaf.Jim is my favorite actor.I am waitless."
1,"The Mask, Meets Lemony Snicket","Horrible movie because of Jim Carey. Over rated as a comedian he hams his way to an easy paycheck while the children, paying subtle roles as the MOST important characters are almost chased from the scene by Carey. They are constantly upstaged by a manic Carey waving his hands, grimicing and acting like a spoiled child who cannot bear anyone else getting any attention. The bad parts were anywhere Carey is present; the other actors performed very well. But it was like any other movie Jim Carey has been in: a person in need of psychotropic medicine. I doubt that Mr. Carey even read ANY of the books. Avoid the movie and buy the books."
1,not true to the book AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I saw this movie I was really disapointed. I mean I was waiting for this movie ever since the first trailer came out! It wasn't book one book, two book, book three, it was 1/4 of book 1,half of book 2, 1/3 of book 3, and the ending of book 1!!!!! Still, if I hadn't read the books I would have liked it better."
2,I disliked It,"I disliked this film and regret that I bought it. It failed to hold my interest. It has many great actors, but the storyline leaves much to be desired. It is too dark to be endearing or fun, and far too predictable throughout. It seemed to me like a poor imitation of a Harry Potter-like film but fell far short of pulling it off. Rent it first...if you must see it."
1,Waste of Time,"I feel that this movie is nothing more than a waste of time. It is a horrible display of such wonderful books. I never thought such a good book could possibly make such a sickening movie. But then again the movie isn't really much like the book at all, it ventures out on it's own, far far to much. I found this movie a complete waste of time and feel that if you want to learn about Lemony Snickets works the I suggest you read the book. It might take a little more time but it would be very much so better spent."
4,My nieces and nephews were capivated,"More like 4.5 stars!Listen, dont rate the movie in relation to the book. Overall I think it did a decent job relating to the books main points. Imagination and Perseverance. I watched this movie with 4 nieces and newphews. Ranging from 6 to 14 years old. They all enjoyed it. The storytelling and visuals were top notch. So even if the youngest squirled away and came back to a scene, he still enjoyed it.Watchit as a kid who never read the books, did you enjoy it? Yes...enough so that the 9 and 11 year old made me take them to the library. Who else could have pulled off the role of count olaf? And if the movie was any darker (or count olaf more evil) it would not be a childrens movie at all. If you want that , then go see City of Lost Children (which by the way, is in the same vain theaterically, but a more adult transation)."
1,The only Unfortunate event is me watching it!,"If you have read all thirteen of these books, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! You will be sadly dissappointed with the brief review of only three books of the WHOLE series. I have now learned not to get my hopes up with a series with many books like this. Terrible with a capatal T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E."
3,ITS AN OK MOVIE,"I watched it once and now its collecting dust. Although it is a good movie, I could have waited for it to play on cable. I would have been just a happy."
3,Very different to the books,"I loved the books, they are amazing, the writing, and everything about them. Sadly, i dont believe this movie has cut it, it is nothing at all like the books. I admit it is still a good film with great acting by everyone, but i still think the storyline is so off the books it makes it not as easy to watch, because there is 2 versions of the same event contradicting themselves."
4,"Wake up, Enablers!","If you ready to make a difference in your family AND help the one who is chemically dependent, read this book. Whether you are the one who is chemically dependent or a family member who has participated in this life-style with the addict, this book tells you exactly what it is going to take to get the addict and the family back to functioning as normal as possible. The author includes Christianity as a helping tool but understands that the church is not exclusive to this healing process. Sometimes your pastor and church family doesn't understand enough about the addiction disease to help families and that's okay too as long as you seek professional help AND look to your Christian support. If you want honesty and are committed to becoming a healthy person/family again, this is the book that can make the difference."
5,love these,"I spotted this shoes on about a week prior to buying them, by the time I actually paid for them the price had dropped about $10.00. When I recived them I just loved them. They are so comfy, they go with shorts or jeans. Great product for under 20.00"
3,Comfy but hot,"These shoes are super cute and comfy, but the fact that they are made of rubber means that your feet get pretty sweaty and sticky, even though the shoes are well-ventilated. I ended up returning them and purchasing some similar but made of leather (and, of course, more expensive)."
5,Loved the shoes,"Great shoes for $25....made out of some kind of plastic, but really comfortable and well made....I would them again in another color."
3,dissapointing,"After seeing his video on emerging viruses and vaccines, which is an edge of your seat scientific lecture, this one drifts from the title material into some off topic off the wall areas. Wished the editors would have kept it on topic."
5,One of his best,"I read a lot of mystery and thriller novels, and Stephen Hunter is one of my favorites. Why? Because his stories are driven by the plot. His books move. That's one plus. The second: Hunter, as a journalist by trade, doesn't fall back on eye-glazing cliches to convey mood or action: No ""pulse-racing"" here. So, in addition to fast-moving plots, you know you'll be seeing action in a new light, written in a new way. By avoiding cliches and digging up new metaphors and similes, Hunter gives the reader new images for their heads.""Pale Horse Coming"" is much better than ""Hot Springs."" The latter was good, but ""Pale Horse"" keeps the pages turning with a tightly focused plot and some really interesting characters.I know there's got to be at least one more Earl Swagger book out there."
5,Great Action,First off I must say this is the first Stephen Hunter book i have read and it won't be the last. Mon this guy can really write! The characters are well written and the action is non-stop. Check this book out!
4,A Tale of Evil and Retribution,"Mr. Hunter has provided an intriguing glimpse into the dark side of man and of the cancerous nature of political and personal corruption. Though Earl Swagger is the hero of the story, even he is not without faults. He is also a hero presented with realistic capabilities, not as a 1950s Rambo.The novel has a few inconsistencies and forced explanations that prevents me from giving a five star rating, but overall, it was a good read."
4,"exciting story, loose with the facts","Hunter has an engaging writing style and can spin a good tale for sure. He is loose with his his history. Swagger states (referring to Blacks in ww2) ""They bled at Tarawa like everyone else."" Im pretty sure there were no blacks in the assault troops at Tarawa. Internet histories of the Marine Corps support this. Any Documentation on this would be welcome.RegardsDoc"
3,"Turn your mind off, it is fun!",Audie = Audie MurphyElmer = Elmer KeithJack = Jack O'ConnorCharlie = Charlie AskinsEd = Ed McGivernBill = Bill Jordan
3,grand old men,when the old men become the story. the story roars. the rest of the time the story lacks the Hunter smoothness.
5,Pale Horse Coming,Another excellent book by the Author Stephen Hunter. I could not put it down and plan to read it again soon. An excellent book about Earl Swagger. You will be surprised at the ending of the book. Great job Mr. Hunter.
5,Great Historical Sword and Sorcery,"Much like David Gemmell, Stover is at his best when his fantastic fiction has an historical backdrop. I wish he would write more in this series and give his straight fantasy a rest. This is much better."
4,A Better Western,"This is one of Audie Murphy's Best. A real adult western. Audie Murphy, out to avenge the killing of his father by the gang who jumped their claim, gains a rep as a real fast gun. He rides into a town where the sheriff/gunfighter (McNally) uses his rep to keep the local gunmen in line. When the sheriff is crippled he covers his injury with bravado and hiring the ""kid"" as his deputy. It's cross and double cross as the sheriff chases the kid away because he thinks the kid betrayed the secret of his injury to his enemies. It's up to the kid to save the sheriff, get the gang and his revenge, and save the day. Great performances by a perfectly selected cast make this a must watch for classic western fans."
2,Not want i expected,"Not what i expected, I thought that you coud ring it like a bell. I would not purchase this product again if I had the choice."
5,Grease CD,This original cast album CD of Grease is great. It is a classic. I highly recommend it to any collector of Broadway albums.
5,Funakoshi Sensei Life in Karate Guide,"Awesome read and instructional guide for those who may be considering embracing Karate as a way of living, not just for sport karate or to live like a karetaka, but actually internalizing the survival and philosophical applications of karate on our daily doings. A guide to discover the esoteric meaning of self control, loyalty, honor and etiquette encompassed in karate, beyond the mere exoteric physical functions of punching and kicking. Highly recommended for the martial way enthusiast. A great timeless window into the concept of interpratation of Karate by a true Karate Grand Master. Osu!Adames Sensei,Manila, Philippines"
3,The plot line is good...,The plot line is good but if your looking for more than just jiggly girly parts then this is not the movie for you.
4,Interesting,This book is very interesting to mw because the girl is very different. She does not seem to care what people think of her. I liked the fact that she met Blane but I don't like how his friends pressured him. If they were his friends they did not have to accept his girlfriend becaue she was not their girlfriend.
3,"Good book, Unlikeable protagonist","I really must preface this review by saying I have an aversion to organised religion, even fictional religions get up my nose. This I believe has coloured my enjoyment of the novel. That is not to say this novel is not executed well. The description of the alien society is well thought out, original and believable. The fanatical nature of the cult trying to overthrow this galactic religious empire is also well thought out and very believable.I would have liked to have seen how the protagonist morphed from the great unbeliever in MolitorAb to the prophet of her. Because I didn't see this transition (and I have a hard time believing that the initial 'miracle' just flipped a switch in his head) I had a hard time believing this change in character, so that by the end of the book I had a very hard time trying to like him. If you don't mind religion mixed with your sci-fi then you might very well love this book."
1,A waste of money,I purchased this for my granddaughter thinking it would be similar to the Lite Brite my children had. The disappointment started when you could not push the pins thru. We had two grown men trying as well and we all found it was way to difficult especially for a toddler.I would not recommend this at all.
3,DID NOT RECEIVE MY SHIPMENT,"I AM DISAPPOINTED, I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM OR THE REFILLS TO IT. I ORDERED THIS ITEM AND THE REFILL ON JAN 30TH 2011."
4,"Good product, poor listing details","I bought these because I was hanging a big canvas wrap picture but needed something about 1/2"" deep. They work great for that, but the labeling on the listing is pretty poor. What you're actually buying is a complete set to hang a mirror (this includes the 2 weight supports that you see in the picture and then 2 top side holders to keep the top against the wall). I bought qty 2 of these, and in reality only needed 1. Chalk that up as a win for the seller! Good product at a great price though!"
2,"Oh, would that Mickey could stop wooing me","No. Just no. Don't rent this. OK. A little something. It makes a lot of noise that adds nothing to the plot. Sheryl Lee (probably spelled that wrong) apparently has been scrabbling for a paycheck ever since Twin Peaks and it depresses me to see her act at all since that effort. There's a few other ""never rans"" in this that seem to really be trying but all for nought. I think Mickey Rourke is usually interesting, even in bad movies and he was in this one, too. But that's about all the good I can say about it. Honestly, I knew better than to rent this but I did. Shame on me."
1,This is really misguided.,"I have seldom seen such a bad movie with so much talent. (David Arquette, Stephen Baldwin, Mickey Rourke, etc.) One wonders what they saw in potential for this script or why they made choices to be involved.This horribly misguided film centers around a juvenile prank gone awry that ends up involving two bank-robbers who freak and there is enough gratuitous violence and mindless killing (and torture) to last me for the rest of my life. The film starts out terribly boring and gets more mindless and boring as it concludes, perhaps expecting the violence to make up for the total lack of story.This is a disaster not worth enduring. Save the actors and film-makers the embarrassment of seeing this film and see something else."
3,Rule missed the truth,"Ann Rule missed the facts on this one. Mike and Debbie are wellknown to me for many years. Though Debbie has severe psychiatric problems, Mike was not brilliant nor attractive. He was very smart, but incredibly immature. He was never a ladies man. Debbie showed obvious signs of mental instability years before she had children, but it was overlooked by the medical establishment. ( ala Dr. Michael Swango) Mike and Debbie were codependent. Mike has always been a jerk. Debbie is sick. How sad, but don't make Mike look like a victim. Why the heck did he leave his kids with Debbie when she was deteriorating in front of him? He is to blame in this tragedy, too."
4,"Interesting, but ...","""Bitter Harvest"" was extremely interesting but alsovery opinionated. Mike Farrar obviously had his problems, and Debora Green had hers, yet Ann Rule's points were nearly all in Farrar's favor. Nevertheless, it was a good read."
4,An interesting page-turner without a conclusion.,"This book was an interesting page-turner, but I was frustratedthat Rule could never bring herself to state the obvious conclusion --- Deborah Green is an evil person. Sometimes evil cannot be explained, but our society must be willing to admit that it exists."
2,Not one of your best Ann...,I have to agree with others on this one.A wee bit repetitive and downright boring in some parts.Ann Rule is one of my favourite authors but I was disappointed in this book.This is one of the rare times that I have not finished a book.Better luck next time.
1,Ann Rule is the Master but she missed BIGTIME with this one!,"I love Ann Rule. I've read everything, but this was the worst true crime account I've seen in a long time. Divorcing couples rarely have two innocent parties, and this one was no exception. Yet, Ms Rule showed no compassion for Deborah Green, who despite mental issues, AT LEAST HAD CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN, while Mike was running around discovering himself sexually? (Somehow, Ms Rule wants us to believe he is a tragic victim, HA!!). The real victims, the children, were not given fair representation either, it was just a mess. Deborah Green was portrayed as a monster, while the husband was a ""total"" victim, it was obviously biased. Unbelievably so, coming from a single mother? Ann what's happening?"
2,"Story interesting, delivery repetitive.","The characters were very interesting. Ann told the same information when she set the story up, when she covered the series of events and again through the investigation and during the court trial. This made the book very boring."
2,Lacking in Intensity,"I love Ann Rule. I've read several of her books. This, however, was not one of her best. It was interesting, but analytical as I'm sure it had to be to explain the effects of the Castor Oil bean and techniques used to detect arson. I prefer books that focus more on the characters. This story was a tragedy but I didn't find myself getting ""into"" the story like I did ""The Stranger Beside Me."" It wasn't one of my favorites."
3,Definitely A One Sided Story,"Where was Mike Farrar's responsibilty in this??!! He isportrayed as such a victim through the whole story. The only thing I think he was victimized of was the ricin poisoning. He should have been busy getting custody of those kids instead of tending to his sex life. Debora was/is obviously a lunatic.That was clear from the beginning of their marriage. Why they proceeded to have three children in an already bad situation, is typical of Modern American Family Destruction. It seemed as if he married Debora for her prestige and income, not for the ""good person she was"". Thank God Lissa has survived and a father who is now involved. Although he's ALREADY remarried...what a surprise....hopefully he has made better choices. But they always seem to be self serving."
2,not up to the 'Ann Rule' standard of excellence,"Ann Rule has set an exacting standard of excellence in true crime writing...one that few authors can emulate. However, her recent book,""Bitter Harvest"" was a disappointment. The story choice was intriguing (as are all her choices) but it seemed like she spent most of the story rehashing and repeating the same information that was explained in the first hundred pages. Her stories are usually overflowing with descriptions and evaluations and character analysis but not this time. We still love you Ann but please...bring back the old ""Ann Rule Standards for Excellence"" for your next book."
4,another great ann rule book!!!,Ms. Rule did a brillant job on this book and following the story of diane and her family. Had a hard time putting it down...
2,Brendan Kelly...again,"Lawrence Arms is like the Broadways part II as a trio that seems to pick up where the Broadways left off. One thing I enjoy is that this is album is not as ""political"" as the Broadways and seems to talk more about life's problems. The guitar part is overpowered by Brendan's high annoying screams, and it gets old really fast. To be honest, it sounds like a half-assed recording. You would be better off seeing them live for that's when they sound their best and it would be cheaper."
3,You will not receive a Honeywell filter,"The item I received was not a honeywell filter as advertised. I put this info in my review to amazon and recived an e-mail from the seller telling me it was better than the honeywell. If I wanted to order a generic I would have. This has never happened with any of my amazon purchases in the past. I have always received what I ordered.The e-mail from the seller said this ""In order to sell on Amazon we have to piggy back off the listing of other companies. We are not happy about this and are forced to use their descriptions and pictures which are not what we would use if we listed our own products.""I think it is just an excuse they use to falsly advertise. Order at your own RISK!"
4,"This is a good book, but hard to summarize.","Mama's Bank Account is a good book, but when it comes to writting a summary, it's hard. This is a really touching story and it teaches family values."
2,dissapointing,"I expected with everything that I have read from Meldrum that this would be a really good bigfoot dvd to own. Sadly this is not the case. It literally is two discs, both are just someone in the crowd at hotel presentations with video cameras."
3,SHORTEST ALBUM EVER?,"This Alice In Chains Album has my favorite Alice In Chains' song ""Got Me Wrong"". But, other than that the rest of the songs are average by AIC standards. There is only three other songs by the way one of which, Chris Cornell lends his vocals to. Well, there is actually 5 songs total if you count the ridiculous bonus track complete with fart noises and, other silly sound effects. If, you are a serious Fan of Alice In Chains you should buy this Album. If, you are looking to purchase your first Alice In Chains CD, buy either Jar Of Flies or, Dirt. But, if your looking to buy Sap chances are you already own those two albums."
4,Good but not Great,"Make no word about it, this is a very good disc. Extremely short, but still a good disc. However, the only songs that really ever appealed to me on it were Brother and Got Me Wrong, Am I Inside and Right Turn both sound rather similar to each other."
1,masterwork? Hell NO!,"What would you need to be on to think this is a good album, or that AIC has a good album in the first place!!! You would have to be stoned! This album and the rest of AIC's catalog sound like the same exact song repeated 6-10 times an album. Wake up people, you own one AIC album you've heard em all."
4,One for the fans,"As a previous reviewer noted (albeit nastily), this album doesn't work well for those who are not into Regina's music: one person's nuance and allusion is another person's pretension.""Sparse"" is probably the best word to characterize the songs on ""Songs"", as I think none of them has any more than her voice and piano. The post-production is pretty much non-existent, and there are some songs where the emotion trumped perfection in the recording.Altogether though, I really like this album. I would view it as more of a way of completing your Regina Spektor collection rather than starting in on it.(PS: there are places around the 'Net where this album can be found new. Think of the fact that Regina was Indie before Soviet Kitsch; where would an indie artist sell her CDs?)"
5,Great Korean Movie,"A 'Must Have' if you are a Jo In-sung (Jo In-Seong, Zo In Sung) fan.This movie is fantasic!the english subtitles are excellent."
5,Fantastic Korean Gangster film,I picked this DVD up from one of Amazon's marketplace sellers for around two dollars.What a great deal. This is a dark and gritty gangster flick. It started a little slowbut turned out to be a great film with some great action and very good acting. Thisfilm would stand up well next to any American gangster film from the last ten to twentyyears.
1,A disappointed yawn...,"I bought this CD because I'm quite a fan of AIC and Layne Staley. Well, ""disappointed"" would be an understatement. Almost every single song is devoid of a really good hook. With the exception of ""River Of Deceit,"" this explains why you've probably not heard any part of this CD on the radio. Take a listen to ""I Don't Know Anything,"" for example. The title constitutes 95% of the lyrics of the song. All in all, pretty vapid stuff."
5,One of the greatest albums of the 90s,"For those of you who buy this album expecting to hear all the heavy guitar work and anger that makes up most alice in chains albums and some Pearl Jam albums, you may be in for a suprise. Before listening to this album, understand that it is completely different than anything both of these bands have ever made. And by saying that, it is a killer album. Maybe not quite as good as ten or dirt, but still, listening to Above is total bliss. Layne Staley's vocals have never sounded better. He has to be the greatest vocalist of the 90s. Mike Mc Creedy's guitar work is excellent, and the songs just plain rule. buy this album if you like any of these bands. You won't be dissapointed. Don't buy this album however if what you want is a hard and heavy album with lots of distortions, cuz you won't find much of that here."
1,sucks sucks sucks,"upon further reflection, this album really stinks. I dont care how many alice in chains fans dis my review, the truth is what i preach. This album is boring. I just find laynes attempt at the softer gentler side as phoney as a 3 dollar bill. It all seemed so much more real with 'jar of flies' and even 'sap'. Here, its contrived and banal. If you want to listen to a seattle offshoot that is half decent, go check out one of the albums by 'brad'. The bright spot on this wreck is mark lanegan. But even he can only help so much on uninspired drivel such as this. The heroin killed laynes talent long before it snuffed out his life."
5,The correct Master Cylinder Repair Kit for Trans Am with 4 wheel disc brakes,I've earlier bought another but that's for an after market replacement universal master brake cylinder but this is the correct master cyl repair kit for Trans Am with 4 wheel disc brakes if you still have the original and it works well
3,Problems!,"Doesn't cover the 1987 Somerset well when covering the Body, mostly the door windows and regulators."
3,Could've been better,"This is Kenny Werner's first jazz album to feature electronic ""sounds"". While there are some good tunes on here, it just doesn't have that spark to send it over the edge. The talent is amazing on this album, but the tunes don't really allow for one showcase it. This album just didn't do it for me...at least not how I expected."
2,Two stars for two good songs,"On the whole, this album is pretty unlistenable except for the opening track and the instrumental ""High Falls."" It would have been nice to see these two outstanding tracks featured somewhere else, like a compilation (""Dreams"" manages a version of ""Can't Lose""). Stick with the earlier and/or later work of the Allman Brothers."
5,Great summer reading!,TV Weddings is a hilarious look back at the tv weddings of the past few decades; I really enjoyed it. I have given the book to many of my popular culture obsessed family & friends. It's a great gift & a great read.
1,Bizarre,"I equate this book to a car wreck...you don't want to look, but you have to. I got this book because of the premise...Santa steps out on Mrs. Claus..there's bound to be some interesting results. Interesting is not a word strong enough! I love the strange, the morbid, the sick and demented, but this was extreme. I couldn't help but think the book was written for shock-value in hopes of getting the curios to buy. I guess it works in that respect. The story involves Santa's affair with the Tooth Fairy and snowballs into a sex-fest. There is very graphic sex involving everyone and their grandmother, to the sexual assult of a mortal woman by the Easter Bunny, who just happens to be a voyer. Ummmm...can I just say...Ewwww. I think the humor in the book is way off the mark and borders on sick. I can't even imagine what goes on in the head of the author to dream up such grim circumstances these characters create. Highly disappointed with this novel and never, ever want to read it, or see it, again."
2,Saccharine stargazing,"So sad that a label as promising as ""neo-prog"" seems capable of simply conjuring just about thirty shades of Genesis derivations instead of, I don't know, progressing structurally. Of course the only warmth I'm finding here lies in about 1/5 of a typically overlong runtime found via instrumental interludes, surrounded by a sea of progressive pop exuding that tired British geezer-martyr energy."
1,garbage,"This book is garbage, and quite a disappointment coming from Berlitz, who used to have a good reputation.This book neglects the pinyin, and uses some lame attempt at getting an english speaker to pronounce chinese words while ignoring tonality. Go ahead and use this book if you want to be a complete tool.I will not buy any more Berlitz Mandarin products, period."
5,Better than the first....,"I just finished this book and I cannot believe how much I enjoyed it! I love this series and I do hope that Kathleen Givens comes out w/ more to this or a different story. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am in love with Alex and Mary. This was a great love story, great action, great everything! Please take my advice and read her two books! This one fabulously picks up where the other left off! Way to go Kathleen!"
5,These brownie pans rock!,"I love these brownie pans, I have been using them commercially for over 12 years and they are still going strong. They are not sold in many places, Amazon is one of the only sources I have for them. Once in a while I see them at Target but the pans are bundled with a lid and another baking sheet which I don't need. It took about a month to get them from Amazon but it's worth the wait. They are professional grade without the price."
3,"If spongebob squarepants ate eggs they'd look like this, lol","Am i the only person who looked at the pic and thought ""whoa my god, jesusarus, jurassicpark, its dinosaur eggs!?"", Well anyways, lets take a retrospective analysis of these Synthetic Spa Sea Sponges. Dont be fooled by the alliteration in the title, these sponges arent all that great. In fact, theyre sub-par. There, i said it. Maybe if you collect sponges they might be good, but neither me nor my late wife do so i couldnt really care. Ive forgotten how much they cost, but im sure its way too much, unless you need them to soak up the blood from a dying mans shirt or something important like that. Ehm... thats all!!"
3,Review,"Update: June 18, 2010. Belkin does not support this card in any Windows 7 system. NONE. NADA. Avoid this product.While this device does provide a huge improvement in bandwidth over USB, there is a problem with the design of the card.When Windows 7 64-bit (I haven't tried it on other versions) mounts an eSata drive, the driver classifies this as a ""hard disk drive"", and not as a ""removable disk drive."" This misclassification causes NovaStor's NovaBack program to keep files open and makes the removal of the drive impossible without diddling within the Control Panel, Administration, Services, or doing a Shutdown and remove.So far, no call back from either Belkin or Novastor as to how to fix the problem.But I am able to transfer ~64 megabytes (not bits) per second from my laptop to the eSata drive, compared with just 19MB via USB."
1,So glad I finally finished this,"This book was a huge dissappointment. If I hadn't paid full price to buy the hard back copy I would have tossed it. I had high hopes for this book, it sounded like a nostalgic trip to a family cabin full of fun memories (I had a similar cabin in my life). Instead, this book dragged on and on with none of the characters being particularly appealing or compelling. And none of them were willing to step up and really make a change in their lives, they simply wallowed in their own disfunctionalism. I am so glad to finally finish this book so I can move on to something worth spending my valuable time and money on."
2,Not worth your hours.,What happens when a skilled writer describes an uneventful week in the life of a typical family?You get an accurate depiction of an uneventful week in the life of a typical family--and it's not particularly engaging.
1,Glad I WASN'T There!,"The title and back cover reviews of the book inspired me to buy it while on vacation. I anticipated a great book to read at the beach, but I was sadly mistaken. There wasn't much of a story line to follow and no real climax. The story was so painfully mundane I quit reading it, and left it behind in the hotel lobby when I came home."
1,No Plot and Unlikeable Characters,"A friend recommended Stewart O'Nan as a writer she enjoys. I decided to start with this one. Half-way through it I gave up and returned it to the library. Not one member of this family is likeable and, if you read all of the 500+ pages, you get to spend a lot of really boring time with them. Nothing happens. O'Nan gets rave reviews from professional reviewers - his other books must be a whole lot better. Not sure if I'll try reading him again."
3,Glad I'm not there,"I'm enjoying Wish You Were Here after hearing a running commentary on the book while my husband read it. It is long; it is detailed; the characters are annoyingly unable to change. The children are very well drawn. The descriptions of the place are excellent.Now, tell me why Ken's wife is sometimes Lise and sometimes Lisa. Is this just one more indication of poor editing and attention to detail? I find it the most annoying feature of the book. Come on, folks, let's do some editing. Maybe if there were a better editor, the book would be tighter and less boring to many readers.I'm going to finish it. Overall I like the book."
5,a book to own,"Having read the novel several times, I now return to it mostly to reread Mr. Fairlie's account of the events he witnessed. It's an invariably uplifting experience. His common sense and beautiful hypochondria dwarf even Count Fosco, the arch villain of the novel. For those who haven't yet read the book, its intricate plot and other colorful personages no doubt will also be of interest. A true masterpiece."
4,Plot twists and turns make for a great story,"I enjoyed reading this book. The characters held my attention. There were parts when the story dragged but for the most part I enjoyed the plot and the story line. I liked that this book was ""G"" rated book. You know the characters love each other but lusty love scenes weren't needed for the story to have value."
1,Boring,"Boring, way too much description. Too long to get to any plot. Not worth the read. Who could possibly rate this as a good read. Are these reviews phony??"
4,Very good read,"If you like jane austen, whithering hieghts, Jane eyre and a good mystery you will ove this great book!"
3,Stephen king Skeleton Crew,"I thought this book was very interesting, and enjoyable. It has a collection of all different stories, there is about 15 of them altogether.All the stories were not far apart from one another, some of the stories are for elders, yet some of them are for youngsters. Stephen King was only eighteen when he wrote this story caled ""The Reapers Image"", the most recent was "" The ballad of the flexible bullet"" which was finished in the November of 1983. The book was published in 1984 and was Stephen's latest best seller. The three stories which i enjoyed the most were, ""The Monkey"", "" The Gramma"" and ""The raft"". I think these were the best stories that were more suited for my age. So this shows that i enjoyed the book, and would quite happily read it again. I CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!"
3,Camp Fear,"This book is a scary book and full of adventure but the question is,do you dare read this book?This book is about a class that goes on a 3-day camping adventure and they get more of an adventure than they really can handle. The camp they go to has not been used for a number of years and it was an old estate.To this day you can still hear the screaming of people all around.All was going well and everyone was having a good time.A girl and her best friend went exploring and they found an old mine.They told all there friend and then they all went out one night and they had a scare they won't forget in a hurry!!!"
4,a longtime favorite,"""the woman in white"" is one of my comfort books--something i like to re-read every few years, especially when i'm feeling low. i love the fact that i can have it at my fingertips (i downloaded the ebook edition).it's a great novel. i first read it in school and it still thrills after so many re-readings."
4,TURN ON THE BLACK LIGHT AND PUT ON THE LAVA LAMP,"THIS IS A COLLECTION OF OBSCURE GARAGE BAND SINGLES FROM THE 1960'S. EVEN THO' YOU NEVER HEARD ANY OF THESE SONGS BEFORE, THEY HAVE THE 60'S ""SOUND"", AND ARE QUITE ENJOYABLE. A LOT OF IT IS VERY ""PSYCHEDELIC"" SOUNDING, AS YOU MAY EXPECT. A GOOD CD."
1,Billboards- The secrets of Money for nothing and the coming,When I purchased this very interesting title I thought that I might actually learn something.It is apparent this author is quite disturbed and has dedicated a great deal of time and energy to a meaningless dribble about what I don't know.Please do not let this title fool you.Save you money...What a rip off...
2,"<yawn> Very Dry, Very Boring.","The subject matter is utterly fascinating yet the author has achieved something that is usually hard to do: take a rich and fascinating history of a strange and amazing cult, then bog its story down in tedious and annoying narrative. In otherwords, he may be a good researcher, but as a writer he's piss-poor. WE, the layman public, want to read an account of the Assassin Order, not petty details interlaced with utterly droll wordsmithing.Goes to show you that whomever published this had their head up their ass. I'm very disappointed. Bypass this one!"
2,Anachronistic History,An anachronistic history of the Nizari Isma'ilis of Alamut. Read Farhad Daftary and Marshall G. S. Hodgson's studies instead.
5,Perfect!,"An amazing double boiler, I love it! Quality is good, easy to clean, easy to use. Bought it for my boyfriend after he left his last double boiler on the stove too long and the bottom separated from the bottom pot completely! So far so good with this one!"
5,A scientific introduction to Astrological Astrophysics/ Metaphysics,"Absolutely amazing information. Very, very educational. For the sceptical, scientifically minded - this DVD is absolutely perfect. Bottom line is that you either UNDERSTAND the science/ mathematics/ physics/ metaphysics of astrology, or you dont - no faith or belief system needed or required; The science of astrology is not of religion, superstition, faith or belief - anymore than the forces of the moon phases controlling the ebb and flow of Earth's ocean tides would be.This DVD explains things from a scientific electromagnetic perspective, that allows you to UNDERSTAND astrological astrophysics. Highly recommended.P.S The DVD format is basic, has no wiz bang graphics, no fancy lighting or music, no remarkable locations or backdrops, no sound effects, its not hollywooded, no ability to skip to different chapters etc etc - its simple but superb."
3,step off,nothing new and creative just another girl talking about well female issues the usual stuff you find in essence.
2,What is this mess???????,Man I was so disappointed in this CD.... I bought it the day it came out and I kept thinking I was missing something off the CD because what I did hear was garbage. Man she can not sing at all. Her CD has no type of flow at all.... Better luck on her sophmore CD...if there is one.
5,A fascinating journey through Virginia...,"Recently, I had an aunt pass on from Cancer. Living in New Jersey, I had to travel to my birthplace, Suffolk, Va. several weekends in a row in the final stages and upon her passing. My co-author travelled with me, and we picked up a copy of this book at Shirley Plantation on our way on the first trip down. As I drove, my Co-author, Diana Sinclair, read each story aloud as we drove. I was so engrossed in the tale that I missed several turns along the way. We simply could not stop reading it. The book is well written, concise, complete with locations (We actually visited some of the sites) and informative in historical and geographical detail. An excellant read. In fact, we are going to Williamsburg this weekend, and we have volume two to keep us company...."
2,Purchase mistake,"This is NOT the standard magenta cartridge for a Canon MX7600 printer, as described. I'm going to be returning this one."
3,Wires are too short,"This is a 2' extension which means the door is 2' taller, and the motor is 2' further from the wall. This means each wire needs to be 4' longer, however a longer wire is not included, and the instructions say to use the original wires. On my installation both sensor wires and the switch wire were too short. You can make it work by running the wire directly on a diagonal, but this looks bad. If you want a professional looking installation buy wire before you start and try to hide the splices."
5,Good Stuff,"This is an amazing album. It starts of with ""White Room"" which is a stunningly great song, then goes into the bluesy ""On top of the world"". ""Passing the Time"" is sort of drawn out, but still is pretty good (I'm not sure if they actually had a cellist recording with them, or if that's a synth cello, but it's still pretty cool. The bizzare-ness of the album peaks out at ""Pressed Rat and Warthog"" which has rather interesting lyrics.I strongly suggest this album."
3,Interesting but Unbalanced,"This book is an interesting look into the life of Ace Frehley and his KISS bandmates. The book is written by Frehley's self-proclaimed best friends over a period spanning thirty years, 1965-1995. The stories of excess are great; however, the book is written with an outright purpose to slander Ace, and the offered opinions are often biased. Ace is portrayed as a terrible person by these so-called friends. No one is perfect; and a person who has made such beautiful music can be forgiven for any shortcomings."
1,Poor quality,A disapointing poorly written and edited book. The photos are low quality and uninteresting. Gordon had contempt for the band before hitching a ride with Ace. When he found out that it wasn't his ticket to stardom he trashes Ace and calls himself a friend. Bob seems to think he alone is the reason Ace became a star. They say they wrote this book because they got tired of having to tell the stories again. It seems to me that they just want to get paid for it.
5,a great read for any open minded kiss fan.,"Great stories about Ace. A look at the human sides of one of the most flashy bands of all time. If you are a Kiss fan, you need to take it with a grain of salt. Met the author at a Kiss convention. Real nice guy. This book is worth a look."
2,How Much truth to this?,"I am a loyal Kiss fan, and I find that these two are vindictive ex-friends. I'm sure some of the stuff is true, but a lot of this is just vindictive stories that does not really need to be written about just to get back at Ace because things did not work out between you guys. The story about one trip to Atlantic City where you lost your job and Ace did not pay you to go. Who's fault is that you lost your job? Ace took you as a buddy, not an employee. Its too bad this is how you sell your book, by bad mouthing members of the greatest band in the world and their lead guitarist. I wont give a nickel for Kiss and tell more!"
1,I have NO plans to read this book-- NO STARS,"Gordie Gebert spammed me about this book and his next few several dozen times on KISSOnline. I have since warned him about unsolicited spam and harrassment.That being said, I don't want to read about how he and Ace Frehley got drunk together and messed up each other's lives. I'm an Ace fan; he's treated me well on the one time I met him in 1987. Yes, I've heard some rather ungood stories about Ace from various sources, and I believe some of them, but I refuse to let Ace be slandered by anyone, no matter how long that person claims ""friendship"" with Ace.The truth is, Ace is a faulted man, but that's not why I like him. I respect his talent, his style, and his wacky sense of humor. And NO greasebag with a chip on his shoulder will change that for me."
4,The truth behind the scenes,"At least the authors of this book admit their sins through out the various stories narrated. They fully aknowledge the fact that were two of Ace Frehley's Party buddies. The stories told here are somewhat funny (If almost shooting one's toe and being high all day could be considered funny) but especially instructing. Except for the co author's constat statement that Ace always had a way of making him do things he didn't want to (like he had no mind of his own) the book is a lesson on what excessive fame and money can do to a person. Is a must read for fans and non fans of Kiss, and goes to show you that the Kiss reunion HAD to be for the money, for there's no other way some one like Paul And Gene can tolerate guys like Ace or Peter; and if this is what comes with fame and fortune, thank God i've neve made it with my band."
1,Christian Ministry,"If I had known the author was a Christian minister who believes faith and positive thinking solve everything, I would never have bought (and returned)this book.There's nothing new here. The book was first published in 1966 and ""updated"" in the 1980s. The information is old and repetitive.If you are a devout Christian and want to hear ""good news"" from a minister, you might like this book. If you want real-life, updated information, you won't find it here."
5,As good as always!!!,"As any motorola product, this device is really something. It has an excellent reception, the sound is flawless and it fits your ear perfectly without the annoying sensation of having someting stuck inside your ear. I recomend this product to anyone who's tired of being attached by a wire to their cell phone, besides, it works with any other device that features bluetooth, even if it is not motorola."
2,Bluetooth h500,"It worked for two weeks and than sto working . I think they sent me a bad one , don't think it was Motorola because I love the product . Now I'm on the search for another white Motorola Bluetooth h500"
3,Man it's like this...,"Ok, Im an A-town chick so fa sho Imma prolly have da cd in da stack 'specially since these some down south rappers (y'all know how we do ;))But you know we only get it for the beats anyway. Save ya money and get the bootleg."
1,Please Save Your Money,"all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started. We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STOP"
1,I wish i could give their career 0 stars,"Theese guys are the most lamest untalented southern rap groupsaganst D4L.I meen the beats are gay,their dancing routinesare retarted and their lyric quality is wack,they say the same stuff over again,yeah they shine so brightly,yeah you wear awhite tee,And yeah you think they like me,that's all they say.I hate that new remix single of that song all my peep's like it, but i don't.I already knew about it before it came out.Hey if itwasn't for that remix they wouldn't be hot at all.DON'T BUY THIS,Buy the Chamillionaire record insted."
2,works BUT! sensitivity is crap,works.. but sensitivity makes the light stay always on clap your hands and BAM! done.. always on...no flicker.. its ok. as a normal light but sound activation crap.. well IS CRAP.(yes i tried lowering and raising the sensitivity) i didn't produce the flicker effect seen in many videos...
5,Very best of all times,"I dont know how it sounds for american culture but for me as a Turk, the book is a must-read. Are you sick of all that surrounds your life (ok, most of what you're unaware of) ? Then let the book takes you to another world where you live (as the pages go) a life the way you could have imagined (sure even more).I dont know the american versions but in the turkish version the text is printed in two colors. If you are in the real world the color is green but if you are there (namely fantasia) the color changes to be pinky.I love pinky since then !"
5,Touches your soul deeply,"This is one of the books everyone should read once in a life. however I strongly disagree with the 'age: 9-12' thing. Made up as a tale it's full of serious stuff, not likely understood by small children. I'd suggest reading it after 14 years. (Btw my 10 year old daughter asked for this book just yesterday, I told her to wait some years.)For those who have seen the movie I must say it was spoiled in many ways comparing to the book. (Yes, I liked the movie very well, and read the book only years after...)"
3,Great imaginings spread a little thin,"Michael Ende clearly had a wonderful imagination. His book is rich in images and imaginary beings. This book gave me a buffet of possible characters for stories to tell my daughters. However, Ende never really does much with his characters. Even the protagonist, a young boy who undergoes a tranformation from his journeys, seems a little one dimensional. This may be a problem of the translation, but since I don't read German, I will never know. I would suggest reading Ende's ""Momo"" instead."
5,Amazing!,"I was uncertain about buying this book since the movie had disappointed me, but now I am SO GLAD that I did so. This story is much better than the snippet portrayed inthe film and it reminded me of Narnia and the Phantom tollbooth combined. This is the kind of faerie tale that we need, for children and adults alike."
4,I'm reading it again!,"This was the first every fantasy book I read and I loved it. Much more than i did the movies. It allows the readers' imagination to build their own Fantasia ( that's what the neverending story is all about anyway)and places them in the shoes of Bastian. I didn't watch the movie until I was 14 and I only read the book three years later. I bet the original (German) version of it would be much nicer (but i can't read German). I'm reading it again, definitely. I just got myself a copy ( after searching high and low for it ) eventhough the book cost a bomb."
4,Essence of metafictional writing,"This book by Michael Ende, although thought to be no more that a piece of children's literature, explores the realm of metafiction through self reflection and recursive features. The story of Bastian, a boy who enters the world of Fantastica, itself is an amazing and interesting tale but when you truly understand the metafictional qualities, it will blow your mind."
5,My favorite book!!!!!,"This is one of my all time favorite books. in truth, the book really is neverending. i had seen the movie/s and i didn't really like them. but still i read the book. i will never regret it. i got confused while reading it though because that was where the movie ended. yet i was not quite half through the book yet.it went on and some of the things bastian encounters are so wonderfully imaginative i swelled up inside w/ joy. i hope they remake the movie because it is not true to the book. w/ all the new technology they could do a really good one. so if you like fantasy, this is just about as good as it gets."
5,Give it a try,"I can scarcely remember when I first heard about this book, but it was an experience that I won't soon forget.You probably already know that The Orphan's Tales: In the Night Garden is a fairy tale for adult readers, but you can't imagine how rich, colorful, and engaging this book is.Like all of the best works of fantasy, the reader can positively lose themselves as they turn the pages. The pages, I might add are somewhat annoying; deckle edges are too difficult to flip through accurately when you want, and you will want to, return to that special part. They don't detract from the stories though.Read this book, that is all there is to it."
3,Over Rated,I gave the book three stars. I found it just OK. I purchased the book due to the excellent reviews on this site. It was not as if I didn't enjoy the book but I found it far from the five star reviews that it is getting here. It didn't make me want to buy the sequel and I did find all the different stories a little confusing but I'm not sorry that I purchased it.
2,Not impressed.,"A friend of mine, who likes the same type of books that I do, raved and raved about how amazing this book was. Honestly, I could barely make it past the first 25 pages. I'll probably give it another try, but so far, I have not been impressed at all."
4,An Outrageous Musical Comedy,"The Roger Korman film is one of the least likely subjects to be made into a musical, but ""Little Shop"" succeeds because of its catchy score and ability to make the audience feel that they're allowed to laugh at people getting eaten by a giant plant. This musical, which thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously, is a good by. I actually like this CD better than the film's, though Levi Stubbs was a little better than Ron Taylor. I recommend it."
2,I really didn't enjoy the soundtrack.,"I'm sorry to those people who really loved the soundtrack but I did the show with some really great people and we could have wiped the floor with the Broadway people. The music is still great and I love the storyline but jeez, couldn't they have cast the show better? Kim"
1,"No, no and no! Don't ever buy this!","This is a ""solenne fiasco"". The music is absolutely great, and the performance not. There's not a single competent singer in the whole production except a somewhat characteristic Marinella Pennicchi. The heroics of Hubert Zingerle as Richard in a great heroic aria ""Si l'univers entier"" are something beyond description (a totally wrong voice type with no technique), and the duetto between the shaking door-bell-like Comtesse and belling Richard is off-the-pitch shrieking. Even for a student productions this is a total flop.By the way the recording with a break after each track makes you mad. What might be the reason for splitting the whole into irritating short cuts?When is William Christie or Mark Minkowski taking this extremely gorgeous work in their schedule?"
1,Why Destany isn't worth the time to stay awake!,"The plot, while having potential, floats endlessly around the ominous Drake Scott. It is a fluttering story line lacking depth and is unable to sustain itself. There are too many elements bringing the lovers together. Perhaps had the characters had more depth, and that be explained to the reader it would be more successful to it's predictable conclusion. The 'direction' of the story line is too shallow and the content is more like that of a children's book. It is clear that the author is a novice and unsure themselves where the book is taking them. There is nothing in this book that warrants a read. Time is better spent consciously asleep, or read this book to get you there!"
5,One of the best,One of the greatest movies ever. All around good cast of famous African American comedians. I would reccommend this movie for anyone wanting a good laugh with a good plot.
3,Ummm.. This album isnt deserving to be called Club Mix 2000,"I think that this album could've had MORE and BETTER club hits, and dance mixes...The slower songs on here should have been thrown away and replaced by more actual dance or club music...Save your money for United State of Dance or MTV Part to Go 2000"
3,interesting play,"i found this play to be very interesting. i don't know if i'd call it a comedy, other than the absurdity of the characters. it's one i'd be interested in seeing performed."
4,A way to discover Hemingway,"I had not read much of Hemingway before this book. He is definitely unique.I'm glad I bought the book, even though some of his stories are basic, hard to understand, and lack ""polish.""I still enjoyed the stories. They are quite different in presentation."
5,A Powerful Collection,"A wonderful introduction to Hemingway, these short stories are subtle and intense. Hemingway's gift of understatement and irony is perfect here. Among the highlights are ""Indian Camp"" which is disturbing in its connotations, and ""Big Two-Hearted River"" which should serve as an example of effective short fiction."
5,the best POG album,"This is POG's best album. It is very uplifting. It encourged me through a difficult time in my life, and I am sure it will uplift you too."
1,Series seems to be getting a bit long,"I have read the other four books in this series and I generally liked them, but this book is horrible. The back story with custer is very booring and I have skipped entire sections of it. Fortunatly this book is not very long. I hope bok six is better."
1,Disappointed,"I like Knex in general, but I was very disappointed that this set only contains one battery operated motor. The description says three motors, but two of them are spring motors. For the price I expected a lot more. This set is over 4 times as expensive as the 425 pice value tub, but has less than 2 times as many pieces."
1,TOTAL TRASH!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY TRUST ME!!!,"i'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT OVER TEN YEARS & HAVE BEEN WEARING SHIRT STAYS JUST AS LONG. I'VE WORN THESE SAME TYPES OF STAYS MY WHOLE CAREER & HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL THE LAST 2 SETS I'VE PURCHASED INSIDE OF 1 YEAR. I'M GUESSING THAT THEY'RE MAKING THEM WITH CHEAPER MATERIAL & OR MAKING THEM SHORTER. I'M 6'4"" & I'VE TRIED THEM EVEN WITH PENNIES AS ANCORS & THEY STILL SNAP LOOSE. I'M ACTUALLY THINKING OF HAVING MY OWN MADE BECAUSE I HATE LOOKING SLOPPY. AGAIN, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOUR WELL UNDER 6' TALL. GOOD LUCK!"
3,Too Short,"The product was as described and the company (The Military Trail) was a pleasure to work with. However, they were too short for my husband who is 6'2"". The shirt stays would not stay attatched to his uniform and I had to return the product."
1,too short,"the quality is ok, but they are too short; and i have worn shirt stays for 20+ years. if you are over 5' tall, order somthing else. even with the adjustment as long as they could go, they are too short."
3,"Like Father, Not Like Daughter","There are 2 versions on here and both are just OK. Her voice is good, but nothing unique. At least if there were better arraingements, she would come shinning through. Her father David has the best version, even if his version sounds dated!"
1,Her mom and manager share the blame.,"I also saw the VH1 clips, and I just felt sorry for Katie. She is not meant to be a singer, yet her mother and manager are blinded by their own goals and don't seem to notice or care. Katie appears to be a sweet, sincere girl. I checked out her website, and I felt somewhat reassured to see that the focus of the content is on her recent work as a model. No link to a music page like most musicians provide, just a link to Amazon. I think Katie's found a more appropriate career at which she can succeed. I wish her the best."
5,Katie Cassidy,I think this song is great! She has a wonderful voice! I hope she comes out with more in the future! Great job Katie Cassidy!
1,Not impressed,"A friend passed her CD on to me. Zzzzzzzzzz. She's pretty. Yeah. So what? Maybe she should be a model then. You need to sing well to be a pop star. There are no real instruments on this recording. Her voice is like totaly processed. Kaci's version of this song has been out like forever, so what do we need with another version of the same song? I don't get why they did this. To me it seems like she just decided on Tuesday to be a pop star by Saturday. I read that some producer met her in a drug store and thought she was pretty so asked her to record this song since her dad is David Cassidy. Pretty goofy thing to do if you ask me.Maybe I'll be impressed with her voice if she like takes some singing lessons and records some new stuff instead of some old pop song nobody wants to hear anymore. Her dad can sing so maybe she can too. She should use real instruments and her real voice next time."
3,Good Toy!,"My autistic 12 year old is obsessed with Pokemon, so she loves this toy. The ball pops open all the time without her knowing it and she lost the Pikachu, so that is a problem."
3,A good distraction,"Solidly readable. Pretty heavy on the chit chat though. Lots of reminiscing and politics. A few fight scenes, but not enough for my liking."
5,Dan Abnett is the master,"I have been involved in the Warhammer 40,000 universe for 20 years now, and have been an avid military sci-fi reader for almost 30 years. For 20 years, fans of Warhammer 40,000 have known the basics of the story that serves as the ""foundation"" of the entire franchise - the betrayal of the god-like human Emperor by his beloved son, the Warmaster Horus, who becomes the ""Satan"" figure throughout the rest of the game. Abnett's novel at last puts a human face and details to the story, and has done so with breathtaking, moving brilliance. All of the characters are wonderfully depicted and very engaging, which makes the story all the more bittersweet since we know that despite the nobility and virtue of these characters, they ultimately become villains. The ""fall from grace"" that this book chronicles is a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions - this is now my favorite fiction book of all time."
4,Excellent Sci-Fi,"I was not familiar with the Warhammer or Warmhammer 40000 Universe when I picked this book up. I got it when I stopped over in London, because it was signed by the author and it looked interesting.That has not kept me from thoroughly enjoying this book! It is very well written and well paced. Judging from the other reviews everyone seems to know how this story is supposed to go. I suppose it's as if I am that person who didn't know that Anakin becomes Darth Vader. The characters seem to have a well known destiny, but that was not a problem for me. The character development is very nice. Abnett somehow manages to infuse the Astartes - a genetic creation of mankind bred for war - with layers of depth which are belied by their introduction.If you like gritty-military sci-fi with an Ancient Rome twist, get this book."
2,"Maybe not the best, but has some basics...","After finishing the book, I have to downgrade my rating. Like others, I agree the title is promising, but the content is not ""top."" And I also agree with two other readers about the fact that all those basics can be found in any good cinematography book. As for the digital part, now we have other books that deal with the subject better (see Digital Lighting, J. Birn)."
5,SIMPLY AWESOME,"This is the best collection of Pink Floyd songs ever.The music is amazing and even though the songs are a little different from their studio recording conterparts,they are wonderful.The atmosphere in a live album like this one(their best live album)can never be replicated in a studio.A must buy for all Pink Floyd fans.Those who have never heard of Pink Floyd,will not be disappointed."
2,Enough of these live shows!,"I am tired of listening 2 live shows where the post-Waters group play old Pink Floyd songs... Why they don't make a new album instead? First the 2 CD live show, then this one and then Anybody out there... boring, very boring. Fans R waiting 4 new songs, it is not the way 2 keep alive a team with only old songs (with many of Waters'). The two stars R 4 the pressure with these live shows, of course, they play well as usual."
1,this was a bad experience,"I bought this double cd set and my surprise was that it wasn't brand new and the disc 1 was missing, instead of this, I found a cd of Susanna hoffs, whose name and music are for me completely unknown. this is the first time amazon makes me feels mad about a product they sell!"
5,Great Live Album,This was Pink Floyd in their final major tour and they went out with a bang. This is one of the best concerts I've ever listened to and seen (get the DVD too). The band is backed up by some great players and David Gilmour's voice and playing is superb. This concert reminds us why he's one of the greatest guitar players of all time.
4,A Thrilling Adventure,"I thought this was an exciting book with excellent morals. Most parts of this amazingly exciting book left me wanting to keep reading the book. I liked this book becasue there was a mystery character and I wanted to keep reading to find out more about him. I also liked this book becasue it is a realistic event that could happen. I loved how through the book there was always an event that made me want to continue reading to find out what happens. A character that got my attention was Scout. She was a strong-willed and courageous girl who knew when to stand up for what is right. After all that she went through inb her life, she stood tall and proud and didn't let much get her down. Any type of audience should enjoy this book. It deals with many aspects on life and I recommend this book for everyone to read."
4,John Dewey,"The book was in relatively good condition, quite a bit of markings in the book though, which i wasnt so happy about. Luckily the person i bought it from clearly spent time with the book, so all of the highlights and comments were pretty accurate"
2,Skip this product,"First Accounting is lacking a search function. As a result, you can't look up a transaction by check number or any other criterion. You can only create a report for a specific time period and then hope to find your transaction there. Leaving out the search function seriously diminishes the usefulness of the product.My second complaint regards the sales journal. Sales accounts are defined by customer, and each customer can be linked to only one kind of sale. I run a construction company that sells and services equipment in one transaction. Peachtree only allows me to record a sale for one of the two types of revenue that I receive. Therefore, I am forced to record service income as equipment sales, or vice-versa. What a limitation!"
4,worth the price for the size?,"well i purchased this item unaware that it said 7"" inches, when i received it i was a little upset but, my sister who i got it for, actually loved it. so just make sure if your going to buy this, know its only 7 inches tall! the good thing is that it actually stands. overall it was worth the money."
2,I Miss the old Blindside...,"Lets face it: Blindside just isn't what it used to be.On this new album, they once again show how they have completely changed their style, conforming to a new more popular style of hard rock, one that I find to be more annoying then enjoyable. Sure, they'll be played by all the big networks and your every day joe will know who they are, but really, they've lost thier roots. The new sound they produce just isn't as original, and more importantly, its sound is much worse. Listen to any hard rock station and you will get this sound.I guess this is goodbye to Blindside, as I knew them.I reccomend A Thought Crushed my Mind, or self-titled."
2,A Proper Tribute To The Divas Of Hip Hop Would Be....,"....A CD That Includes:1. Push It (Remix 1987)2. My Mic Sounds Nice (1987)3. Tramp (1987)4. I'll Take Your Man (1987)5.

3,A little too simple,"I thought this book contained information that is common-sense and basic. Not bad if you are not familiar with the subject at all, but otherwise not the most useful book out there."
5,The best,"This book remains the best book on gay male sexuality that has been written. It views sex in a holistic manner as part of an individuals whole self rather than as merely a mechanical activity to be approached like plumbing. The chapters are concise and get right to the point without making sex appear to be rocket science. The cute drawings from the original edition remain but as a previous reviewer suspected, the photos have all been redone to fit the current popular gay media image (ie: early twentysomething twinks). ...Mitch Walkers book is brilliant."
4,"Post-modern, complex, beautiful, worth the effort.","An affair. Two women. A man. Love disrobed and exposed to its multiplicitous passions, pains, and controlled recklessness. ""What kind of woman goes to bed with another woman's husband? Answer: a worm? That might explain my invertebrate state."" Reading Jeannette Winterson is like picking up a broken mirror, looking in it, cutting your hands, then marvelling at how beautifully red our blood can be. Gut Symmetries is a complex work. At times you may become disoriented. You may be uncertain who's speaking. It's worth staying with it until the pieces come back together. Even when disoriented you will find a character's self-reflection cutting beautiful and deep. ""I am not afraid of feeling but I am afraid of feeling unthinkingly. I don't want to drown. My head is my heart's lifebelt."" Handle it as a broken mirror -- piece by piece. Savor it one sentence at a time."
3,Disappointing,"I looked forward to this enormously, but was left with a ""so what?"" feeling at the end. Thomas Hardyesque coincidence about 2/3 of the way through (the previous generation) left me slightly exasperated, though of course I understand where it fitted in the contemporary story context, it irritated me.A previous reviewer mentioned Sue Woolfe's 'Leaning Towards Infinity', which combines mathematics and love / life. A far more satisfying read than Winterson's, which I found too smarty-pants. (The astrological signs attached to each character were also teeth-clenching for me. Was she serious, or was it an attempt to bring THAT into GUT as well?)"
3,Perhaps I expect too much....,"Perhaps reading this novel just after losing my son, and believing that Winterson as a writer of magical rescue from the human condition could do it for me now is expecting too much. But Stella, Jove and Alice are so cynically constructed that their drama is merely an examination of trivial love by a heartless author. I don't need to study physics to confidently assert that these characters are two-dimensional and their author need not busy her brain in finding a way to reunite them in the end. Nonetheless, it is the wordsmith Winterson herself who puts in the mouth of a character what I expect from her as a writer: ""Walk with me, walk it off, the excess fat of misery and fear. Too much to carry around the heart. Walk free."" Gut Symmetries, unfortunately, did not help me walk it off."
3,Poor Instructions,"I like the pictures of most of the hats and gloves, etc. However, I've knit one hattwo times - I don't know how the author came up with the numbers to make the hat I chose,but I don't think she knit it the same as the directions! Buy this book with caution orkeep it as an idea book."
5,"Clear, Simple and Readable!","I easily get bored when i read english grammar books, but with this book grammar become more enjoying and easy to understand. Before going through grammar lessons you can test your grammar by questions and know your weak points. You can use it as starter book for english grammar and as reference. It is very clear, simple, readable and contains some colorful cartoons. With each topic there is tasks and excercises. I highly recommend it for intermediate students."
5,Draw Into the Web,"Bit by bit David Goodis draws you into Eddie's bleak world. Sometimes it is floating, semiconsciousness, sometimes it's the pain of the past, sometimes it's the cold, hard reality. The dialogue is spot on. Nothing frivolous. You don't want to miss a bit. I'm new to Goodis and looking forward to more."
1,Not Graphical!,"I wanted a dictionary that contained graphical representations of symbols, not just a textual reference. I was very disappointed when I received it."
5,the Interpretation of Financial Statement; By Benjamin Graham.,"It Provided me with the relevant information I was seeking.An easy read, the content was self explanatory.I have not read the other books which share the same material, but will do so in due course, then I will submit my comparison.I will gladly recommend it to any one who does not understand the relevance of a Financial Statement. A most read for Students studying Accounting and Financial Management, also anyone interested in the Stock Market."
3,Not necessary,Kinda of boring and old fashioned. Too much already bankrupt railroads examples.I prefer Security Analysis or Inteligent Investor.
5,Good product,This pump work so much better than the old pump I had and the hand pump I have also tried to use.
2,Lasted 1 year and 2 months,"Pump was great while it worked. Bought in May '09, the valve broke yesterday (won't seal, plus pin fell out). Was only used on Presta valves, was used about 3 times a week."
4,Great pump,"I bought this pump because of all the possitive reviews it got. The reviews were right. This pump generates a lot of air volume with little effort. It easily adapts to either valve type. If there is any draw back it is a very large pump and not easily stored. If the pump wasn't big enough, you'd have thought they were delivering a piano in the carton it came in. Then again it is a floor pump. Not like you're going to strap it to your bike. This pump is well worth the purchase."
4,excellent product,I was astounded as to how quickly I could inflate a high pressure bike tire although its been 25 years since I bought my last pump! The dial is easy to read and I did not have to stoop much. The lever at the inflator is a bit big so its not easy to inflate in tight places like a push golf cart tire. I highly recommend this product and should have bought a new pump years ago.
5,Love this product!,"This bike pump is super easy to use. I use it several times a week, and it has never let me down. I would recommend this to friends."
5,awesome product,"I just needed a floor pump for my road bike and wasn't sure how much to spend. I went out on a limb with this one, since it received other good reviews online, even though it was a little more than I wanted to spend.This is a great product, feels sturdy, like it will last a long time, and was very easy to connect/pump. The locking system, when you connect it to your bike is awesome. With some pumps you have to hold that on, while pumping which is awkward, with this pump, you really can just pump it up on your own without anyone else's help. Great product!"
4,Topeak JoeBlow Pro Floor Bike Pump,"In general, I like this product - was able to pump 7 out of 8 car's tires in a very short time(the last one just refused to fill in).But it's a task to get the valve on and off the stem. After couple of times the valve rubber seal top partially came off and this is really bothersome.I didn't use this one a lot, so I can't tell how long it's gonna last."
2,Both the CD & Dvd are previous releases,"As big of a B.J. Thomas fan that I am, I was disappointed to find out that the cd waspreviously released in 2001Greatest and Latestas was the DVD portion from his 2004 ""That Christmas Feeling"". Though both projects are very good, it would have been nice to know before hand (since I already had them both). If you don't already have the cd, I would not hesitate to buy this project, but don't buy it for the DVD, because it only has a few minutes of the original released DVD. B.J. Thomas is still one of the great singers of our time."
4,"Maybe Nichole's Best, But Her Regular Releases Are Better","Often, I'll get a greatest hit collection first to introduce myself to an artist. This was not the case with Nichole Nordeman. I've listened to three of her other projects, including ""This Mystery"", ""Brave"", and ""Live At The Door"". This would be my least favorite project.There are plenty of good songs on this project. I enjoyed ""Holy"", ""Brave"", ""Legacy"", ""Is It Any Wonder?"", ""What If"", ""Fool For You"", and ""Who You Are"". One omission is her great cover of the Cyndi Lauper classic ""Time After Time"".However, there are collections that show a limited picture of an artist. This is an example. I would recommend getting her individual projects rather than this one."
2,Never again will I buy a Nike watch,"This is my second Nike Triax watch. The first watch the band broke in half after 3 years of use. I bought this watch because I liked the functionality and the look of the watch. Now, a couple of years later the band on the watch has broken and the rubber on the body is coming unglued.The band itself costs $18 and it must be sent out to be repaired which will add at least another $10. Repairing the watch will end up costing half as much as the entire watch itself.Also, my watch had a tendency to reset sporadically from static. I would remove my jacket and the watch would beep and reset."
2,Good Functionality but Poor Quality,"I liked all the functions on this watch, especially the large display, which is why I bought it. It broke after about 2 years, and like most small electronic devices, isn't cost-effective to fix. I have a Timex sports watch that's 12 years old and still going strong. Never again...Also hated the instructions - this huge foldout sheet with all the directions in tiny text in a whole bunch of languages. Clumsy and hard to follow.Just stupid. Nike should know better."
4,Good book for the pesimists,"As a pesimists, I really enjoy this book. Julie Norem's description about defensive pessimism really fits my experience in dealing in various issues. This book is a consolation for those who are often misunderstood due to their pessimism."
2,Not what I expected.,"I expected more theory and practical application. This book is LOADED with formulas (which is okay) but I purchased this book to enhance my knowledge base with regard to Interest Rate Risk, Credit Risk managmenet in the banking industry with regards to the most recent activities in the economy and practical application. This book is highly geared for Math & Quant enthusiasts....not for everyday practictioners.I am sure it is useful to a particular targeted audience, like Financial Engineers/Quantative & Statistical Analysts. Not very practical for everyday Risk Managers. This was an expensive lesson!"
5,A helluva fun read,I just finished Skull Full of Spurs and I thought it was great. My favorite was the story by Edward Lee. It's a real departure for him. The Brian Hodge story is also quite good. I haven't enjoyed a book this much since Razored Saddles. I'd like to see more of these weird western type stories hit the shelves.Highly recommended.
3,You'd be better off with the two-disc set,"The two-disc set BARBRA: THE CONCERT is one of my favorite albums. This is the ""HIGHLIGHT"" version and has been edited down to fit on a single disc. The music, of course is great, but I personly suggest that to really get your money's worth, you buy the whole thing.True, they give you most of the hits (""Evergreen,"" ""The Way We Were,"" ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"") and we get tho here the ""Yentl Melody"" in it's full length (which in my opinion was the highlight among highlights) but they cut out almost all of the talk (which helped set mood and was at times every bit as entertaining as the music) and have the nerve to leave off ""On A Clear Day (You Can See Forever"" and ""For All We Know.""If you are on a limited budget, or are just started to listen to Streisand, then this may do. But I advise everyone else to buy the two-disc set which rates five stars!"
4,Last book of the series,"This was the fourth and last of the Buchanan books from ""Buckles and Broncos. A great read and fun to see the characters from the previous 3 books."
3,Too much shedding!!!!,"I really like the texture of the hair however, before I even tried it on, it began shedding. Good Price, I may not use it more than a few times due to anticipated thinning."
1,Rough icky feeling!,"Yes, this is a basic clipboard. However, it is so rough and uncomfortable to hold that it is like fingernails on a chalkboard. I am returning this item, icky!"
1,Politically correct fairy tales,"Many things make this a ""do not recommend"" - which is tragic when so much time and talent seems to be poured into it.a) The constant backbeat is distracting and based on the assumption that kids need continual noise and ""background music"" to anything they are listening to. This scatters kids attention.b) Denzel does a great actor's job of a Jamaican accent, which is full of terrible English. I don't want my kids talking this way.c) Political correct nonsense. One story is about a Tiger and a Spider. Denzel says it is an African story brought when slaves were taken here. Well, there are no tigers in Africa, so I guess you took it from somewhere else, mon.I don't want my kids told lies about their African heritage, there is enough truth. I don't want them speaking like an unschooled huckster, and we don't need six layers of jazz to listen to a story!"
1,Maybe got a lemon,"Purchased new, but was unused for over a year. Has less than two hours of use now. It turns on and starts fine, connects to a laptop fine, but about 10 minutes later one of two things happen:1. The screen will go blank. A black and white checkerboard/line/strange shapes appear and the unit will not shut down/power off, and none of the menu or other buttons will work. The lamp is still lit during all of this. The unit need to be unplugged.Or2. The lamp shuts down and the orange LAMP signal blinks on and off. Same issue with the power button not working and the unit needing to be unplugged.All of the troubleshooting guides have been followed. Lamp has been put on ECO, and brightness dimmed in order to keep the lamp cooler. Factory reset has been done. Dell support simply suggested doing all of the things that have already been done. Since is no longer in warranty, even though hardly used, Dell will not even look at it for less than $250."
3,Like it very much,"I bought a bigger skydancer Jade two years ago, it's still going strong withstanding handling of a 7 and a 3yr old. On that strength, I have bought this to give as a birthday present. It's a little smaller than I expected but I think it's a good value."
1,Terrible service,the Candian shipped an empty DVD case. no help from anybody and so I have reordered from an alternate companyjac
1,Skunk (the kind you find run over in the road),"I had associated Woody Allen with witty and funny movies. This movie was just plain stupid. I have no idea what he was aiming at with this movie. No complaints about the acting or technicals, it was just a poorly thought out script. I kept thinking how could two guys be so stupid. They can't. It's just some guy's idea of what two brothers would be like.Evidently Woody Allen can still get a job based on his name alone. I had a feeling through the whole film of why am I watching this crap but I kept hanging on thinking there must be something, some kind of payoff for having sat through all the boredom.There wasn't. I probably should have given it another star because the actors did a fine job with what they had to work with but I'm afraid that might encourage someone to waste and hour and a half of their life on this thing.I was really glad when the movie was over. I'll know to avoid Woody Allen in the future."
2,NOT THE HARLEM GOSPEL CHOIR I KNOW!!,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM HOPING FOR THE QUALITY OF GOSPEL I HAVE HEARD ON THE ANDRE RIEU RADIO CITY DVD. NOT EVEN CLOSE! VERY DISAPPOINTING!
1,Do Not Buy!,"Piece of junk. The ""glass"" (plastic) crystals warped and fell off both sides. Very difficult to re-zero. If you want a tool like this, go with one of the electronic ones, which cost no more than this one (like the Scalex mapwheel)."
4,Great for Beginners and Marketing/Industry People!,"Every non-clinician in my medical device company has borrowed my now dog-eared copy of this book! Beginning with a very straightforward discussion of cardiac anatomy and physiology, the editor then takes us through the components of electrocardiograms and how to recognize rhythms both normal and not. I was especially grateful for the thorough treatment of different types and levels of patient ECG monitoring and the sections on ventricular dysrhythmias. Easy to read, good mneumonic devices throughout--and frequent quizzes to self-test your understanding. Found one typo that was distressing, but easy enough to figure out when thought through."
5,Breathtaking,"This collection goes straight to your heart. It's their voices, their song selections, and most of all their enthusiasm and heart that makes this albumn shine. I listen to it over and over and it still is fresh each time. The best Xmas singing ever as far as I am concerned!"
3,Very small,"A lot smaller than I thought it would be, but it is very soft to the touch and feels like leather."
5,Newer cartoonist w/ potential greatness,"A funny collection of comic strips that threaten you to think about social issues in this country without the all the anger. I really love the main characters Lemont, C-Dog, and Susan who seem to evolve w/ each page. I am already inpatiently awaiting the next book of adventures. The romantic tension between Lemont and Susan is obvious, however, I find their tolerence of C-Dog more than a little interesting. Anyway this is an intelligent social issue comic strip that doesn't quite jump in your face like Boondocks, but will try to speak to you just the same."
5,Salt'N'Pepa is an insperation on me,Hey word up I just want to say that salt'n'pepa's songs has inspired me to stand up and face the truth of it.I want to say I hope you all have a verysuccesful life expierince. Peace out
1,Whining Main Characters,"If I had not read the third book in the series and had started with this one then I would NOT have read anything else. The main characters had more drama than a stage play. Melissa was constantly making racist remarks and complaining that nobody liked her because she was black. Sharon spent her life making everyone's life miserable because she had been in an accident and wasn't riding like she used to. Jenna spent so much time whining about the horse, Turbo, that she wasn't able to buy and mentally hating her mentally-disabled sister that it was enough to drive a person half crazy.The only people that were nice were Katie and the assorted supporting characters. For that reason I think that this book was more frustration than it was worth. If you're looking for a happy Saddle-Club type of book then this is NOT the one for you. If you do want to try the series then please read #3: Winning instead."
3,Very thin,"I bought this on sale for my 6 year old son's pillow. It is very, very thin and not very soft. It looks ""Cool"" on the bed, but don't buy it if you want a soft, thick pillow case.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I purchased it for less than $5."
4,Two for the Road,There is good chemistry between Hepburn and Finney. How they work through their doubts and fears about their relationship is interesting to watch unfold. To me they are at their best form in this picture. The way the film goes from present to past to present keeps you interested. I love the movie.
5,"Great price, fast shipping, mint condition","The DVD arrived in days, still in the plastic wrap with all original casings. Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but everything looks perfect. Great price; quality buy. Could Audrey Hepburn be any more beautiful and endearing?"
5,Classic,"This is a classic movie of the time period. If you love romance, this movie is for you. Well done Al and Audrey."
3,Scenes From a Marriage,"""Two for the Road"" is a film that I admire but I can't say I like particularly. It's certainly well crafted and the scenes of the French countryside are gorgeous. The chemistry between Albert Finney and a luminous Audrey Hepburn is palpable. What was a little offputting to me was the structure of the film where they crosscut moments from the marriage of Finney and Hepburn in non-linear fashion. The makers of the film may have thought this clever but I found it headache inducing. Also a little offputting was the constant bickering between the two. For sure there was some profound insights about the disintegration of this relationship but the verbal sparring became numbing after a while."
3,Not as advertised,"The toy is durble enough, but we did not get a twenty piece set. As others have mentioned, we only received 3 teacups and saucers not four as advertised and as shown in the pictures. I bought this for a Christmas present and unfortunately it has been over 30 days so now it cannot be returned."
2,"The first book was fine, but...","A better title for this book should be ""Kiss and Tell - the Feedback"". Although there are a few new stories (most of them contributed by guest writers), the bulk of the book is comprised of e-mail that the author got about the first book and descriptions of radio interviews he gave. If you liked the first book and you're a diehard Kiss fan, you'll find the sequel(?)rather enjoyable. But don't even think of buying it without reading the original ""Kiss and Tell"" first."
3,space madness,"whoa!gordon,gordon,gordon. With the ""ace/peter incident"" you just drove well into the more than I needed to know country.But, as you say,it is your book. However,acefans,none the less,even if you are angry at gordon for this,you must read the part about ace having ""to go"" at the boxing match.I about died laughing.I'm sorry,but for those of us who have withstood long lines at concerts/events,somebody should give Ace a medal and a few ""attaboy""s for that one."
3,Yesterday with today's vision,"Ozzmosis represents the ""new"" stage of Ozzy's existence in a more ""socially"" conscious era. While it lacks the general hard core sound of his previous albums it tends to reveal the true diversity of the madman. No longer is the music the focal point of recording but rather his vocal prowess for which the album deserves kudos. It is the 90's Ozzy and reaches into the past to guide the future."
2,Very Bad,The music on these songs had potential but Ozzy had to screw it up by writing poor lyrics. He is not a lyricist whatsoever. Geezer Butler was. Don't buy this rubbish. Early Ozzy albums are a must though.
2,Very mixed.,"The older albums sounded very much like the 80's, This album came out 95' and the sound is total opposite. Heavy drumms and heavy bass are allways good but the bassdrums on this album sounds very plastic. The guitars are also badley mixed. Way to screamy and to discant registered. But if you look to the songs on this cd it isn't that bad. Most of the songs are pretty dull with much heavy midtempo, unengaging choruses and phsychadelic echoing guitars. But on the other hand some songs are just sooo good! Like the bombastic album opener Perry Mason, Ultra cool I just wan't you, The calm and beatiful See you on the other side and finally Old LA Tonight. Well I can't really recomend this cd because you'll have to skip most of the songs each time you listen to it. Download the songs I recomended instead."
4,A Huge Leap Ahead for Ozzy,"Ozzy finally came up with the solution for his stalled writing partnership with Zakk Wylde. Instead of firing Wylde, as Ozzy has done in the past, he hired other writers to help out. A wise move on Ozzy's part, as Zakk's instantly identifiable and astounding chops are now an integral part of Ozzy's sound.As Ozzy describes in the new liner notes, he tried a lot of new song ideas on this record. Some of them work, some of them don't - but the percentage of winners is much higher than on his last two releases. Songs like Perry Mason and Thunder Underground feature chunky guitar grooves that will have you headbanging in no time.Production on this recording is finally professional, if a bit slick."
3,A solid release as usual,"I'm not too crazy about Zakk Wylde's fat guitar sound since it tend to be too much after a while, but it sure is a contributor to the overall heavy sound on this album. ""Perry mason"" is this release's highlight together with the attractive ""See you on the other side"" and the closing ballad ""Old L.A. tonight"". Like most of Osbourne's albums, this one includes great material as well as a couple of non good songs, but all in all it's a solid rock album worth having in your collection."
2,"This is not his best, I assure you that!!!","THis is not Ozzy's best album, no way, pal!!! THe sound here is flat and industrial, very strange. Below, the list of Ozzy's best studio albuns, in my opinion:1) BLIZZARD OF OZZ (the ultimate masterpiece)2) DIARY OF A MADMAN3) NO MORE TEARS (best album with Zakk Wylde)4) BARK AT THE MOON5) DOWN TO EARTH6) NO REST FOR THE WICKED7) OZZMOSIS8) THE ULTIMATE SIN"
5,Ozzy's Sgt.Pepper,"Man the first listen to this cd and I was blown away. AMAZING!! Probably my favorite ozz cd. Saw him on this tour also on the No More Tears tour,but this is just a masterpiece. Favs include Ghost behind my eyes,and Ol'L.A.Tonight. You can tell that Ozzy is a Beatles fan by some of the music on this cd. A more mature Ozzy. Awesome!!!!"
5,Great Movie - Close to BBM.,"This movie was almost as good as, if not better than Brokeback Mountain.My girlfriend and I watched it together (yes, I'm semi-straight and still enoyed the movie), and she agrees that the movie was a sweet love story.We both laughed. She cried. 5 stars."
3,Young Lads Story,A story of a school graduate finding a way out and to the higher social level by coming out with an elder brother of his mate and leaving family issues behind.
5,An amazing story!,"I found out this movie by accident and I loved it. It is not just about a specific subject. For me, it was about developing a relationship and about personal improvement. I think it is one of the best stories I have ever watched."
5,Great Movie,This is a great love story that I am pretty sure everyone dreams of. This is something I wanted as part of my collection and glad that Amazon had it in stock.
5,Best gay movie ever,"Most gay movies are low budget and cheesy. This movie has great actors, gream film technique, a good screen play, a compelling plot, interesting characters, beautiful scenery, and leaves you feeling moved and challenged at the end. I'm glad I live in one of the cities where it is showing in theaters because I plan to go watch it again in a few days. I'm a bartender at a gay bar and asked many of my customers if they have ever seen a better gay movie. Everyone who has seen it said that nothing they have seen in the gay genre is as good. Highly recommended!"
4,Great Film,I loved Shelter. It was a beautiful film that I can watch over and over again and it was so close to life. Thank you Amazon for delivering me the DVD well before time and in good condition. I will keep ordering more stuff from you in the days to come.
3,cute but cheap,"I received this item, and couldn't wait to try it on (for my husband's b-day). This item was super cute, but very cheap (given, it's not meant for anything but to pulled right off). Anyway, one ribbon (on the bra part) was off and two more were loose. Also, the cups weren't exactly in the right place (I ordered a large that fit in the bra area like a small to say the least). So, if you're handy with a needle, and are a C or below go for it, if not I don't recommend."
1,"""Beauty Tips for Christian Girls""","This book was a missed opportunity to truly educate young women as to their true beauty. Rather than focus on healthy, deep ways to improve Christian girls' self-esteem, this book emphasizes outer beauty and leaves almost completely unaddressed inner strength. In avoiding the ""hard questions,"" this book really missed out on a chance to empower young Christian women. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who seeks to make a positive, lasting impact in a teen's life."
5,This is their best album,"Every song on this CD is awesome. People that are Dokken fans that don't like it are stuck in the 80's. This album is very melodic but keeps the hard rocking style that they are known for. I agree with the L.A. Weekly article, if it was released from a seattle band it would have been huge. Some of the best tracks on here are Lesser of Two Evils, The Maze, What Price and Too High to Fly."
1,DYSFUNCTIONAL INDEED...,"What apiece of ... This return from DOKKEN adds nothing to their discography. It's the same old formula of copying the others, heartless commercial pop-metal. I must give some credit to Don Dokken, he really has a great voice, but it's serving the wrong purpose: that of glam-metal."
3,Different style from earlier albums.,"This album's not so much a disappointment song-wise, than it is style-wise. Being a listener of Dokken since 1986, this isn't what I expected when I bought it as far as I remember. But for what it's worth, it's an ok album. Too High to Fly is a good song, but the album is not really my style of music. If your lookin' for songs in the Under Lock and Key vein, don't bother buying this."
1,Must-not see,"If you rent (or even worse, buy) this video, you will regret it. I know I did.Acting is terrible and the version I bought (argh!) had a horrible transfer, both visually and audibly.That's what I get for not reading reviews first..."
1,Menu screen issues,"I bought this tv February 10, 2008. At first, I loved it. But yesterday the menu screen started popping up randomly and frequently. I did some troubleshooting but it's still there. I tried contacting Haier but ended up leaving a message because I didn't want to wait on hold all day. A tv is pretty worthless if you can't watch anything because the menu screen is up half the time."
5,Terrific Suspenseful Read,"While one does become suspicious early in the book regarding ""who"" done it.....the mix of characters and their ultimate fates is an engrossing read. Ferrigno continues to excel !"
1,They are nice but not worth $79.97,This item was $39.95; I have no idea why they raised the price so much.It is not worth it.
5,Great Comedy!,I really love guys as a duo. The second movie is the funniest. The Whole family can enjoy these good old clean and funny comedies.
2,Below-average offering (2.5 stars),"The Meat Puppets where one of the best bands of the 80s, but once they got signed off SST to a major label they seemed to have lost something. They didn't sell out, but a certain amount of soul present on ""II"" and ""Up On the Sun"" just wasn't there. The problem is they seemed to get swept up in the grunge explosion that happened. That isn't to say this is a terrible record. There are a few good songs, notibly their big hit ""Backwater"" amoung a few others. However, something just wasn't there. The lyrics weren't as funny or as emotional as before, and it leaves no lasting affect. I know there are many who disagree with me. If you like grunge such as Soundgarden and Mudhoney, you'll probably like this. If you like classic Puppets however, you'll not like this too much. Not bad by all means, just not that great either."
5,One of the best albums ever,"It starts off kind of weak, but quickly becomes stellar. Some of these i can listen to over and over. Sort of a mix of Joan Baez, Nirvana, Sparklehorse, and Rusted Root, except completely different."
4,Great Talent,"Terrence Trent D'Arby is one of the Baddest Artists over the Last 20 Years that Has Been Forgotten About.His Words as a Writter are out of this World Great.as a Musician He can Play Many Instruments very Well&the Production is Amazing.His Voice is Full of Soul.Undeniably is a Great Song.We Don't Have that much Time Together is Fantastic.He Covers SO Many Styles with Such Ease.A VERY,VERY UNDERRATED GENIUS.He's The Best 90's Artist Folks Slept ON."
2,Rated E for Especially Harsh,"The Zelda games are mostly rated E for everyone... Not this guide! Sure it's got lots of characters, like King Dodongo, and Saria, but drawing them is a different story. The instructions are very undetailed and I bet, even if you think your patience is supream, you'll agree, this is nothing short of not very usefull. If you're like me, and want to draw or at least get a few tips on how to draw Link, I still suggest, think before you buy."
2,poorly made!,"I'm so disappointed that Disney would put their name to this product. First, there is no reason why there should be so many pieces that we have to put together. The base of this kitchen should really be in two or three pieces,not 20. The quality is soooo poor and shotty. I would rather spend a little more on a Pottery Barn Kids Kitchen, that will at least hold up and look nicer. Little girls will love it no matter what but it is so cheap it will fall apart in the first month or so....not worth it!"
3,small and not very sturdy but cute.,This toy is really small and not very durable. The oven door is always coming off and so is the sink spout. Also the interior brackets for the rack in the oven just slide in and do not stay in place. But it is cute to look at and is a nice edition to a room already decorated in a princess theme.
1,Web designwe,"Just wanna tell you that ""ActionScript 2.0 garage"" author, Mr Dan Livingston, is cheating the customers or users of his book, as open codes for this book can not be downloaded from www.wire-man.com/garage as he informed or suggested. When you click on above site, it will show you some silly stupid site, which has nothing to do with ActionScript/garage.Amazon.com, please contact the author and try to verify it. Could you reply me then. I couldn't find by any means to write dierctly to the author of this book. I'm totally unsatisfied with this garag book and therefor this book can let rotton in garage foreever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks lot in advance.Sincerely,Ramesh"
5,"Excitement, excitement, excitement.","If you want action, you've got it here. From the beginning through the very end the pace never lets up. I don't know who Dalton is, but he obviously has an insider's view of the military and writes about the various services with authority. This is a Fail-Safe for the 90s-- one has to wonder with machines taking over more and more functions, where the line needs to be drawn."
4,Another good adventure.,"Though I do not at all like the way novels are being published (many chapters, with few pages leaves far too much white space), I enjoyed another adventure with Reecher. It is most always an entertaining read, but is also filled with material that is not at all decent for young people."
4,Fantastic Desert Rock,"This is a fantastic album, and definitely not what you'd expect from the former Kyuss drummer. It's such a laid back, groove-filled, chill-out album. Definitely pick this one up."
4,"Entertaining, but a little thin","The illustrations are good, but occasionally a little distracting and unecessary. The story is true Discworld, with satire and references. When you remove all the illustrations, the book would only be about 70 pages (a novelette?) I liked the story, but I hope this isn't the future of Terry Pratchett's output. I'd rather wait 18 months for a novel that 9 months for an illustrated short story."
5,Wow!,"I, like the multitude of reveiwers before me, was absolutely floored by Kidby's illustrations. I particularly liked his portrayl of Rincewind and Vetinari, Ankh-Morpork, Death (of course!), and the fabulous space views of the Disc. However, the most enjoyable part of this book for me was actually the writing :-p ! Pratchett uses some of his best one liners in recent memory here! The plot harks back to the early days of the Disc, but this only serves to highlight the author's development. It seems that the Discworld is finally on the road to recovery after ""The Truth"", in my opinion the only genuinely bad novel yet. Vetinari in particular seems back to his old self.What more can I say? This is classic Prachett writing, matched with unparalleled arkwork, and though it is definitely on the expensive side, I thought it was well worth it."
5,More then expected,"I was expecting one of the excellent satirical/fantasy Discworld books by Terry Pratchett- the last one I was missing. ""The Last Hero"" is certainly that. I was not aware it was a beautifully illustrated edition of the book- you would have to see it to believe it. I was very pleased, and of course, it arrived on time and in perfect condition."
3,He hurried through this one...,"Artwork is terrific, except Paul did not recall (as I do) that the Lady has GREEN eyes. The story is too SHORT and feels very rushed. Carrot is wooden, the Patrician just isn't his ole slithery self. Rincewind is more than ever a self-effacing heroic worm, though.After THE TRUTH, I thought Terry ought to take a break. Now I'm not sure that he didn't."
2,Less is not more.,"Bare in mind that most folks reviewing this book are die-hard Pratchett fanatics, the types who will pay a lot of money for a 167 page coffee-table book. If you witlessly love anything Discworldian then you do not need reviews; you will adore this book. If you like, rather than worship, the excellent writing that Terry Pratchett is capable of then you will be seriously disappointed with The Last Hero. This is the sort of substandard (compared to the usually high standards of Discworld novels) work that inspires conspiracy theories. Perhaps the pod-people have taken over Pratchett's body and are trying to pass as him. Or an obsessive fan has written a Discworld book and palmed it off as the real thing. Terry Pratchett is indeed one of the best satirists currently in print; it is a shame that he now seems to be writing fake versions of his oun style."
4,great overview...just enough science,Reading this book has given me insight into our upcoming trip and a more 'personal' relationship with the animals we will see.
3,SACD version,"I'm glad that I purchased this SACD surround. But, given that, it's not the best example of Multichannel. I think you'd have to get a studio album to really get the full multichannel ""wow factor"". They could've done a lot better on the bottom end on the remastering. The bass sounds a bit muddy. There appears to be more seperation on the guitars (which is a good thing), and the voices are clear, and of course the album is a classic. Probably very difficult to get these early albums to really shine, but it's still fun to listen to."
3,Not for the ignorant.,My vinyl version of this album is long worn beyond the playable. I thought this would be a great replacement. But this format will not function on the typical cd players of today. I think it belongs with the Sony betamax movie recordings.
1,Attention Insomniacs!,"Figure skating fans! Are you having trouble getting a good night's rest because of insomnia? Have I got the cure-all for you! Read Heart and Soul by Elvis Stojko. It's a guaranteed yawner--except for the unintentionally funny stuff. I have never seen a more boring, predictable, cliched book on figure skating in my life, and I've read many."
2,He's SOOO macho!,"This book gets a 3 for unintentional humorous content. This young man is so involved with making himself look macho that he comes off looking foolish. I hope that someday he'll grow up and realize that leather, motorcycles and ""macho-talk"" do not make you a man."
4,An interesting review of an exceptional man,"An interesting angle on this athlete's highly controversial career. Nice to hear things from his point of view. The pictures are stunning and the story of his struggle for the recognition he deserves, truly touching."
1,Very Disappointed....NOT The 1970 Release,"I, too, am a member of the Johnny Cash forum at www.johnnycash.com and was very disappointed when I received this reissue of a CD that has been available for quite some time now. When I first heard of this release, I called Amazon to confirm the track listing was correct and was reassured that it was. But, when I received the CD today, it was not the release of Johnny's 1970 ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" LP. I am sure that this is a HUGE disappointment to all Johnny Cash fans :("
2,Stick with the original,"The much beloved characters of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic are recycled in what is basically a script for a made-for-TV horror movie. Stick with the original. If you can't get enough of Long John Silver you'd do better to read Bjorn Larsson's Long John Silver, which does a much better job at staying true to the original."
5,Inimitable!,"A marvellous story, made into an equally marvellous espionage thiller for the small screen starring the late and great, and I mean GREAT, David Hemmings. I salute you, Sir! Freemantle is a master of plot and storytellimg. I wish all his stories had been made into films with David Hemmings in the starring role."
5,stanley road,"I had written Paul Weller off after subpar outings with the Style Council. After the urging of a friend, he persuaded me to pick up this title. After listening to this, I realized Paul Weller going back to his roots with The Jam. Although it is much more mature than his old school days, I enjoyed this outing very much. His writing style has come back with some middle aged anger which made me very pleased. Fans will not be disappointed."
2,Stanley Rd,"This one seems to get great reviews elsewhere, but to me it typified Paul's 1990s fear to recreate any diversity of sound. The montonous accoustic style of music here didn't please me nearly as much as his Style Council days.Having said that, it's just a matter of personal preference.I still think there are some great songs on this album, named after Paul's childhood neighbourhood."
3,Not all discs worked.,This was an awesome set for my son and he was excited to get it but one of the discs wouldn't work. Other than that it was fine but he was disappointed he couldn't watch the very first disc to the season.
4,Super Psycho,This Perfect Husband is truly a Super Psychopath. Lisa Gardner has gone out of her way to create a monster of the first order. The usual authorities are no match for him and his methods and madness put him in the tops ranks of the (fictional) serial-killer hall of fame.
4,The Perfect Husband,"This book that I read was a real good book. I'm not into reading books, but this book I defidently recommend. I give it 4 stars. The book was about this woman who wanted to get married. She meets Jim Beckett, they fell in love and got married. she thought he was everything she wanted him to be, or so she thought. As the years go on she finds out that he is not so perfect after all. She finds out that he is really a cold blooded killer that murdered a dozen woman. She puts him behind bars, but he escapes from prison and tries everything to find her. The only person that can save her is an ex-marine. When Jim escapes that's when the terror begins."
2,Not as impressive as The Other Daughter,"My first Lisa Gardner novel was The Other Daughter. I absolutely loved it and couldn't wait to read another. I was a bit disappointed in The Perfect Husband. I didn't find it to be that suspenseful. THe first half of the book focused on Tess and JT and there was little excitement. The ending was okay, but again, not that suspenseful. There were many details that were not expanded on to satisfy the reader. I am not giving up on Gardner, however. I am currently reading The Third Victim, and can't put it down."
5,So good it's scary. So scary its magnificent!,"This is a must read for suspense lovers, or book lovers anywhere. Perfect Husband is so well done it makes my skin crawly, makes thunder in my chest, and makes my heart ache for her characters. A superb read! Lisa outdid herself with this one."
3,The Perfect Husband,"I won't review the plot since it has been done already. I did enjoy this book and finised quickly because I wanted to see what happened at the end. Howeve, I only gave it three stars because I felt it dragged a bit through the middle and I felt too much time was spent on JT & Marion's problems when the book was about Tess. I know it was important to deal with their issues to get their character but I felt it overshadowed Tess's problems which were alot worse at that moment in time. I would have liked to see the relationship between JT & Tess developed better. I also thought him in bed with the prostitue the night before he had Tess was a little off. I know it wasn't necessarily a romance novel but I just felt a bit put off by their relationship. I also didn't understand Tess leaving her daughter with the police when she didn't trust them for herself. It was a dark book and not for a light read by any means but good nevertheless."
3,The middle of the road...,"I would have to say that this book was about average. The novel got my interest then lost it, and then got it back toward the end.I enjoyed the beginning of this book. The characters and story were introduced very well. Little bit of back story while going into the meat of the theme was a lot of fun. Then it takes a weird turn involving a love story and doesn't really go into a whole lot of detail involving the serial killer and his past. I was really expecting to go into a lot of depth involving the character, ""a little cause and effect"" thing didn't happen. However, as the end approaches the novel gets interesting again with a lot of thrills and chills.All and all I can't recommend this book to mystery/suspense fans. The book just didn't keep my attention throughout the whole thing.Grade: C+"
2,"Skip this one, read ""The Other Daughter"" instead.","After reading Lisa Gardner's novel ""The Other Daughter"" (which I found very interesting), I was anxious to read ""The Perfect Husband"". Unfortunately I found this first novel to be weak, with a disappointing and very unbelievable plot. The second novel is a strech too, to be quite honest, but nothing like this first one. We are honestly expected to believe that this serial killer, while constantly on the move, changing his appearance, makeup, clothes, is able to murder someone and then drag another dead body to the top of a building in a short span of time. Additionally, I found the addition of JT's sister rather odd and didn't add to the plot. Read the second book and skip this one."
1,SKIP THIS BOOK!,"Really terrible first novel, trying to continue reading it gave me a headache.I recommend you read ""ALONE"" followed by ""HIDE"" and not waste your time on this.By the way, there is no such time as ""oh seven hundred thirty"". The correct terminology would be ""zero seven thirty hours"". This mistake is repeated and very annoying"
1,does not compare with a few of her others.....waste of time,"I've read several books by Lisa Gardner. This one I will not finish. It is not in the same caliber with her other books. Umfortunately, I do not recommend this one."
5,Entertaining even on the 100th reading,"The theme is simple: a backhoe driver, accompanied by his dog, have five digging jobs to complete in one day. The story line, however, has a great combination of repetition and flavor. And the ending helps toddlers/preschoolers see the worker at home doing in a small way what he does at work (note the title!). The illustrations are just as important to the story, and offer a secondary plot line, involving the dog, not included in the text. There's plenty here to read but, more importantly, talk about with children. After at least 50 readings (maybe twice that many), I greatly appreciate how much there is in this little book."
4,cute construction story,My kids and I heard this read at the library story time. This is a great book to share with kids who love big construction equipment. Mr Rally is a construction worker and he has a dog who loves to dig!Mr Rally has five jobs to do. As you and your kids follow Mr Rally about through his day you can use this story to ask how many jobs does he have left to do.Great for preschool story times and even makes a great bedtime story!
3,Excellent summary of Hungarian grammar,"Excellent concise guide into some of the ""why's"" of the eccentricities of Hungarian Grammar, presented in such a way as to make memorization easy and fun. It's a pocket book that you can take anywhere, pick out on a train, and get a lot of Hungarian assimilation in as much or as little time as you have."
3,Fair Collection of Biggest Hits,"His three biggest hits are here in their original forms, but aside from that, the rest is pretty much non-charting filler."
5,the ever experimenting Deep Forest,"Music Detected was my first CD by Deep Forest, and I loved it. I was really suprised to see all the negative reviews for that album. I decided to check out Boheme, to see what all the fuss was about. Without a doubt, Boheme is a fantastic album. I still adore Music Detected, though. They are both wonderful in very different ways so it's hard to compare them. I am planning on checking out more by Deep Forest ASAP so that I can truly experience all the overflowing brilliant experimentations of the French duo."
5,hunter,I enjoyed the television series when it was on in the 1980's and enjoy it at the present time because it was a well told and well acted program. The characters and storyline were entertaining as well the actors believable.
1,Beware of substitute music,"Hunter was one of the first shows besides Miami Vice to feature popular rock songs playing in the background of many scenes. Unfortunately, many of the songs have been edited out and replaced with subsitute music, no doubt due to an unwillingness to pay high royalties. Anyone who's seen the reruns in syndication will instantly spot the changes in the DVD version. The new music ruins the enjoyment of many episodes. Also, the packaging is very poor, with only the vaguest of episode descriptions provided and the biographies of the shows stars presented in a format that is so ridiculous it can hardly be described."
5,"Nice, but I need the tape version of this too.","I got this (CD) album and enjoy it, and want to get another for my elderly French mom, but she's confused by the use of CD's. Therefore, where can I get this on tape instead? Amazon doesn't seem to have it on tape. Merci."
5,"Amazing Career, Amazing Person","My first introduction to Joe Pantoliano was in the classic film La Bamba in 1987 when he played the real life character of Bob Kean (Kuhn). My next introduction to Joe Pantoliano was the even more classic film of Midnight Run with Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin and here we are 15 years later and I see Mr. Pantoliano in just about every decent movie worth watching and to top it off we see him join the ONLY TV SHOW worth watching,(The Soprano's). The bottom line is Mr. Pantoliano is a well gifted man who comes from an amazing background and his story is well told with David Evanier who wrote Making the Wiseguys Weep (The Jimmy Rosselli Story). Thank you Mr. Pantoliano for your career, it is well worth following."
1,Most boring autobiography EVER.,"I'm part-way through chapter 2 and I'M DONE. There isn't a single interesting anecdote or story from his childhood yet, and I am not going to waste more time to see if there is one left in the rest of the book.Don't bother buying, downloading, or borrowing this book.Boring. And he's a HORRID storyteller. I'd give this book zero stars, but they require at least one."
5,Works great on the stock of my carbine.,I use this on the end of my stock for my Kel-Tec Sub 2000. It works great and was easy to install.
4,Another costumer using this for other purposes,I purchased a sheet of this to add grip to my firearms as some other reviewers have done and it works great. I have discovered that the sticky side does not grip well to certain serfaces but over all it is holding up fairly well. I also put a few strips on the steps of my deck to add traction. I would imagine this stuff has a plethora of uses besides skateboard (and firearms grip) usage.
3,great cd,Good CD Please get this one asap. Great vocals great songs. This cd will lift you up and put you in the mood to get crazy.
1,Three Penny Opera - Not What You Think,"First of all this head banger CD is packaged with the Brecht/Weill musical Three Penny Opera, which is misleading. Beyond that, the packaging of the CD itself makes it look like a new age, zen-type of music. In fact, it's not anything like either of those. Instead, it's a really poor recording (technically, the sound quality is just bad) of head banger percussion. The lyrics are written on the insert, which is a good thing, because they are incomprehensible on the recording. On the other hand, they're not very interesting to read either. Too bad this CD had to be opened to discover that it's not what you think it is."
2,Ferryokee,"I have every Roxy Music album. They should be in the Rock Hall of Fame. I have every Bryan Ferry solo release. For Your Pleasure, Siren, Avalon, These Foolish Things, Let's Stick Together, Boys & Girls are all phenomenal. I even found things to like on Taxi.This one is not so hot, in fact, it's quite disappointing. I always expect a little musical adventurousness from Bryan Ferry. These versions of Dylan's songs are sort of light-weight covers rather than the kind of interesting re-interpretations he's done in the past. Rod Stewart could have made this album. Sting could have done it. Yes, Sting, it's that bad. All he did was sing over a bunch of boring stock arrangements like Andy Williams would have back in the day.Instead of Dylanesque they should have called it Ferryokee."
2,The Most Underrated Artist Meets the Most Overrated,"And for all his taste and restraint, Ferry can't make much of this overwritten stuff. Sorry, but Dylan's work lacks any sense of melody; his lyrics vastly overrated. If Ferry really wanted to cover the work of the best songwriter of thje last 30-40 years, just imagine what he could have done with Leonard Cohen's work. Ferry singing ""I'm Your Man""? What brilliance that would have been. Ferry does manage to bring some beauty to ""Make You Feel My Love."" And what he does with that song makes you again wonder what good the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is without Ferry or Roxy."
1,the hookers blow,ONE OF THE WORST BANDS EVER. NOTHING PUNK OR DEATH METAL ABOUT THEM WHAT SO EVER.THE PEOPLE THAT THINK THEY ARE GOOD NEED TO GET OUT OF THEIR HOUSE MORE.
3,great resource,I found this book to be of excellant value. My life has been changed with the practical counsel it gives. It gave me the encouragement I needed to go on to the next level of training.
5,Real talent,"I saw this on PBS in 2005 when they were somehow using it to grub for money, and I could record it there on dvd; however, this work done by Proenneke is magical and pure so I will buy it here. Watching this, we see a truly great man. He must have used one of the old 8mm cameras. I think in those days a person had to actually wind the camera like an alarm clock and the spring would turn and move the film."
4,Great music to mellow out to...,"Anyone looking for pop greatness on this album should look elsewhere. All About Chemistry is by far one of the best albums I own. Although the writing is lacking at some (very few) points, El Matador, Who's Stopping You, and I Wish make up for it. Don't try to find another Closing Time here. You'll be very disappointed."
3,Sunshine & Chocolate -- -- -- Tasty Treat,"Pundits might trash the band Semisonic for any number of faults, still one can gleam tasty treats from their new release 'All About Chemistry.' Who can resist track 6 'Sunshine & Chocolate' a fun chewy romp full of verve & bounce. Warning, ya need to crank this one up to get the best effect, it would really sound good in a club full of people high of whatever takes them there. In the mood for retro feel fun, slip this tune into the mix, why resist chocolate?"
3,"Bit of a snoozefest, really","All the reviews I've read so far compare this album to other Semisonic albums, which (at least as far as I'm concerned) is not really the point. This is the only Semisonic album I've ever heard and quite frankly, it's a bit dull.In buying it, I broke one of my own rules, ie: never buy an album where the featured single is the 1st track. The quality is sure to go downhill from there. I thought ""Chemistry"" was a fantastic pop song and bought the beast regardless.Well, some songs are good and I still like ""Chemistry"" but there aren't enough good songs to really make the whole experience worthwhile. The lyrics are somewhat vapid and the melodies aren't all that catchy. This record doesn't ever really take off and GO places or lift me up the way a good power pop CD should. It's just not FUN.I won't relegate this CD to the nether reaches of my collection, but I can't see myself playing it all that often either."
3,Still Needs More,"This book despite its size is a book that seems that it needs more. I mean in historical events. The book is for a local history buff, especialy those here in the Charlotte area. It is fun to read about the history of where you live."
4,Caleb@ AsleyRiver Creative Arts Elementary,Ralph's drawings were are fantstic. He is extremly creative when hiding pictures. I found many cool pictures. He is my favorite illustrater. My favorite page was Z. It was an amazing animal. Zygorhiza is a weired and scary animal!
1,Totally What You'd Expect,"When I heard these two clowns (Sixx, Gunns) were getting together to record an album, this is totally what I expected, bad music that's so ridiculous, I can't believe any record company was stupid enough to sign them.These two haven't progressed musically at all. They took samples of the cheesy eighties music they used to record back then (which was really, really bad in it's prime!!) rehashed them for this album and what you get is this poor excuse for music.Four grown men in their late thirties coming up with a name like Brides Of Destruction!! Can you really get more ridiculous than that???!!!"
2,Atrocious Writing,I remain fascinated by the Borgia family despite the atrocious writing. A high school student could have written a more engaging dialogue with a more elevated vocabulary and syntax. (I taught writing at the high school level for 22 years.)
5,Headless Pin gun,This is the best tool I've owned. The headless pins enter the hardest of wood with little show from exterior making putting crown molding or base boards a breeze.
3,His hits for Epic label,"This collection is valuable because it contains Johnny Rodriguez's last 3 top 10 records. ""Down on the Rio Grande,"" ""Foolin"" and ""How Could I Love Her So Much,"" were all top 10 hits in the late 70's and early 80's.All songs here are original recordings. The packaging is budget line."
2,Kids = Folk Implosion Promo-CD ???,"The Music isn't bad, but I can't remember the songs ""wet stuff"" and ""nothing gonna stop"", ""good morning captain"" and ""Natural one"" from the movie itself? Where are all the cool rap songs??? Just one short song from Lo-Down... It seems that this soundtrack was used just as a Promo-CD for the Folk implosion and slint... If you search a CD of the ""REAL"" kids soundtrach, then don't buy this one. I am searching for the names of the artists and the song titles of all the rap songs! please write me if you know them!"
5,"Even in 2004, this album is still wonderful!!!!","I just bought this album not too long ago and man, why did I sleep on it for so long. This is one of those few albums where you can listen to it all the way through toooo many times and not get tired of it. All the songs are just that good! And, you will never get tired of Kenny's smooth voice. But, what makes this album truly great is the fact that although the album was released about 8 years ago, it's still contemporary and very refreshing when compared to a lot of today's music. To anybody reading this review and are curious about buying this album, it's a worthy cop. Buy it!!!!"
4,VERY NICE,"THIS WAS A VERY GOOD CD. I COULD LISTEN TO IT FROM BEGINNING TO END, ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. AS A MATTER OF FACT I WILL BE WALKING DOWN THE ISLE OF MY WEDDING THIS SUMMER TO THE SONG FOR YOU."
5,one of the most emotional music I've ever heard!,the first time I've listened to her music was two years ago and she rocked my world from the note. I think I just listen to her beatifull spirit when I play her songs and they're giving me a lot for my own spirit - again and again! she's gorgeous and everyone who has never listened to her music missed something in life. rock'n roll baby!!
1,Poor quality and wig hair was creased from packaging,I had high hopes for this wig after reading some of the reviews but mine arrived with creases in the wig from being folded in the package. I couldn't straighted the hair out so that it was wearable. Also the length was much shorter than the picture shows. I ended up returning it because the wig wasn't wearable unless you were going for the creased lop-sided hair look.
3,Decent wig,"It also worked well for my V costume. Y'know. V for Vendetta.I don't know wigs, so I don't know if it's good or not."
1,Garbage,"If anyone wishes to know how bad electronic music can get, purchase this cd. Most deride contemporary electronic music for its simplicity and lack of emotion; this music exemplifies that very criticism. Many of the ""remixes"" are little more than cheap ripoffs of great remixes by delerium, sasha, and others. The remixing is little more than the regular song accompanied by a house beat. This should be copyright infringement."
5,great scooby doo dvd!,"this is a great dvd! it had all the scooby doo episodes that i remembered watching when i was younger, but couldn't find on dvd before. definitely worth buying if you love scooby doo!"
4,1 tool please!,"OK, I thought that I was going to get several size brake tools... like a kit, based on what I saw in the picture. Silly me, the text clearly states ""Lisle 25080 1 1/2"" Rear Disc Brake Caliper Adapter"". It doesn't list any other part except for the 1-1/2"" adapter. Fortunately this one fit my needs.Choose wisely my friends."
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"It would have been easy for Weller to simply rehash his debut solo release and keep exploring the acid groove territory. But, instead he decided to dig a little deeper, and the end result is nothing but perfection. At first listen, you may not get it. Be patient, it takes a while to grow on you; but, boy does it grow on you. At certain times, Weller isn't afraid to just rock and let it all hang out (""Sunflower"" or ""The Weaver""). Then, he pulls back into a shell of uneasiness and mysterious imagery (""Wild Wood"" or ""Foot of the Mountain"")that is way out in the deep end. This comination works well for him, and (dare I say it) the album is as solid and memorable as albums like ""The Joshua Tree"" and ""Check Your Head""; every song fitting together like a part of a puzzle, forming the perfect picture."
3,Good hooks inside worse ones,Solid example at overcoming bland songwriting by a few wise embellishments.
4,Buy it for song 1,This CD is all about the first song. I bought the CD because I could not find that exact version online to download. The songs by Hasselhoff are terrible! I was surprised by how bad his voice is. Some of the other songs are ok. This is a fine CD to play in the background and tune out.
5,Huzzah for Powderfinger,"This album is amazing. It's what I like to call ""car music"". Melodic enough to use as background music, yet it rocks out enough to be able to get excited to. Great lyrics don't hurt either. It's not the regular, ""angry man with horrible life"" stuff that saturates the American rock scene today. If you like Foo Fighters, Coldplay, or Neve, I suggest you pick up this keeper right away."
4,These guys rock,"As a new listener I love this album. I have since hearing this , gone in sarch of all things PF. Finding the common older releases is easy but keep an eye out for the more obscure tracks and releases from the early days."
5,A Difficult Subject,Henri Blocher takes on the most difficult topic in theology and philosophy. He is economical with words as he develops his arguments.
4,Enchanting BUT annoying (no track numbers!). Not much music.,"Note: Ladysmith Black Mambazo only sings a bit in the background; if you want more songs get their ""Gift of The Tortoise"" which is EXCELLENT even for adults to hear the music ;-)Anyway, my 4-year-old loves this, and even I don't mind hearing it repeatedly. Danny Glover is very good and very animated.BUT THERE ARE NO TRACK NUMBERS!!!! Yes, OK, it's just one long ""track"" because it is a continous story. But when you drop off your kid, eject the disc to hear something else :-D and then put this in again to continue the story...you can't very well. You have to try and fast forward all the way to where you left off, and it's annoying as hell.Buyer beware!"
5,Empire of Cupid,"Peter Fried cautiously, almost gently, but firmly approaching the cantatas.Not raced down the fine pieces, he doesn't want to attack them neck and crop,but only tasted a piece of long sonorous lines.Exercising a bit of a recurring verse, the swing sound of some of the da capo section.Style and expressive power of knowledge can not bereason to complain, Fried wonderful suited to ease the operation,but due to the dramatic power sounds the cantatas."
2,full of mistakes,I am disappointed with this book!! Full of mistakes!Example lab 1: Advertising a route into RIP ver 1 does not work if the major net on the interface has a different subnet mask then the subnet he tries to advertise to R5. What he is trying to accomplish is nonsense! You cant advertise a route if it is in the rip database by just creating a loopback interface on router R1!Then further on OSPF why would he configure authentication on a loopback interface which is printed out on the CD under configuration examples? Quite frankly this book is not a 5* for sure. I bough it to prepare myself for the lab but I am looking forward what else I discover. So perhaps the author should publish some corrections or updates to this book!Thanks!
3,fair for the price,"not very explicit, extremely basic but ok as a reference for starting oxyacetylene welding (I got quite good at it at A&P school and just bought a rig for home use)."
1,"Wobbly fiction, wiley ego","A disappointing read that lacks insight, verve, or style but overflows with bitterness, cliche, and predictability. Any television ""movie of the week"" offers more depth, any ""Yo Mamma"" joke offers more wit, and any newspaper's classified ads section offers a more deft choice of vocabulary. Fiction at its most mercenary, editing at its most lax. Take it off the shelves before someone else has to suffer through it!"
1,"Terrible Author, Terrible Book","This is quite possibly the worst book ever written. There is ZERO depth of character development, not to mention plot. This book jumps around more than a child on a trampoline. Toward the end it seemed like the author (if you can call her that) got tired and decided to just throw things together haphazardly and wash her hands of it. And speaking of the author, what's with that ridiculously immature bio on her website? Is she 12-years-old? No serious writer would ever pen such an ignorant phony bio. Did Appollo have a relative at the publishing company? I cannot fathom how this book ever got published otherwise. Grow up, get a life and hire a ghost writer in the future...you know, someone who can actually WRITE."
3,"Average in content, average in style","Having had this book recommended to me by a friend, I find that one cannot account for taste. I found the characters wooden, the main character too much of a stretch, and the movement of the story herky-jerky. Forced emotional moments made me nearly give up several times. The ending disappionted me, very lackluster."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Famous ship recovery.Before it became cool, or even achievable Clarke came up with this. The story is basically what you would expect, except that rather than the story of a mission to do just that, it is the story of competing missions to salvage the wreck, to see who can be ready and get it done first.Clarke fans should still like it, but if the Titanic holds no interest, pretty avoidable."
5,Shows the everlasting desire of humanity to leave a mark.,"A dramatic showcase of the everlasting desire of humanity to leave a 'footprint' - on Earth and beyond -.Clarke blends here science and thechnology with an epic fight for prevailing, resembling human ventures to the Nature's process of evolution"
1,Should have read a book!,This movie is truly awful! To be fare I haven't seen the last 30 minutes. I used it to redeem myself for the hour of my life I had already forefeited to this corny ass movie!
3,String Theory,"Ben Webster loved strings as accompaniment, but he's mellow enough on ballads already. ""Music For Loving"" is a better mix of strings & Ben, with great arrangements by Billy Strayhorn & others, plus you get to hear Harry Carney's session with his lush baritone sax. Still there are some moments on this CD, & Ben's playing is primo. Notes: ""Time After Time"" sounds weak compared to the version on ""Ben Webster & Associates"", the one cut on that CD that features Ben solo & ranks as one of his best ballads on record, so unlike the ""jam-session"" feel of the rest of the cuts there. Warm Moods works best on ""shuffle"" mode mixed with other CD's."
1,A portrait of melodrama,"This movie is pretty boring, nothing happens. It lacks a plot, and the directing isn't artistic enough to compensate for the fact that they really didn't have anything to fill this movie with. Basically it's about some people living in Israel who for no particular reason are depressed and jaded. What ensues is scenes of angst, emotional distance, and corny existential ramblings. All of this happens behind a forcefully bleak atmosphere imposed by the director. Great.You could buy or rent this movie, but you're better off throwing your money in the trash or burning it."
1,It stinks!!!,"This album stinks. This is by far their worst album. I'm a huge fan and have seen the band live five times. I listened to this album over and over again, truly trying to give it a chance... to no avail. Sorry. Go out and buy ""Up on the Sun,"" ""Mirage,"" or even ""Huevos."" They are all head and shoulders above this disaster!"
3,Pleasant but not really authentic French music,"It's my first CD of L.Voulzy. The music is pleasant; the melodies tend to stay in your memory. When you listen to this music you realize that it reminds you of something else. Very soon you understand that this something else is the British pop music. That is what I did not appreciate in the CD. Perhaps I am too picky in this world of globalization, but too many English words are used in the French texts without any reason. The CD's too international and commercial, too generic and not French enough to my taste."
3,For the serious exploration/travel readeer,"It's my kind of book--a first hand account of a foot safari in Africa before it became so crowded with people, but I can't say it's a must read. I am against hunting in Africa, and I caution that there are frequent hunts and kills described--I try to overlook those for the day-to-day experiences and difficulties of life in the bush in Africa. The author is no wordsmith, but perceptive and honest in his telling, that of course, includes occasional violations of what we now consider PC correctness. If you've read other travel books about Africa, and want another perspective--read this one."
2,Same problem- Switch fails....,"Same problem with me. This is my fourth Zoeller M53 and I just always replace them religiously at five years. My last one just went out at four years with the same problem: the pump won't shut off because of the switch. While four years ain't bad, its less than the past. I'll be researching alternatives and purchase a different brand. My coworker recommends a switchless model: Stevens SS57A Submersible Sump Pump."
2,Switch failed on year 7,"Exceptionally high quality cast iron pump but the switch hung up after seven years and flooded our finished basement. In a bind on Sunday afternoon, I had limited options and ended up running to Men**ds and replacing this one with a 1/2 hp Coleman for 180 clams. Ouch...and I'm not all that confident in the build quality of the Coleman. I'll likely repair the switch and keep the M53 around for an emergency situation or use it in the pit as a dual pump system."
4,Zoeller M53,"Purchased this pump to replace the original sump which was 18 years old.Pump works as designed. Only issue is that the switch has a very short throw, meaning depending on the size of your sump, the pump cycles quite frequently to empty sump.One can always change switch styles, but not really worth the effort in my opinion."
1,Switch failure after 14 months,Zoeller has gone down hill. Had prior pump for 12 years - not one issue. Replaced with M53 and switch failed in 14 months. Finished basement ruined. Too bad their slogan isn't something you can rely on.
4,Liked it.,"I enjoyed reading this. I thought it had the melodrama and twists that makes Dumas fun to read. The title may be a little misleading if you don't read the description of the book closely, since it is a romance during the time of the reign of Louis IV, but not of the reign itself. I knew this, so it was fine with me."
3,fair,"there are some really great tunes on here with great melodies. there was of course some problems. this may sound stupid but the thing that i had the most problem with was, on the second track there is a melody line that just doen't fit with the song. it is not hard to hear at all. also the greatness of the material is not consistant. anyone can just listen to 5 tracks and be happy, therefore 3 stars. and those stars are mostly for those 4 or 5 songs. the best track on the entire album by far is the 3rd track."
3,Overhyped -- And A Question About Ego,"Big choruses, walls of guitars, a stylistic history lesson in rock'n'roll -- all the tried-and-true Boss ingredients are here. Only this time, once you strip away the topicality, the end result doesn't add up to the avalanche of pop smarts and rock heart that characterized Springsteen's best earlier work. Nonetheless, the critics are going berserk with praise. Fair warning: they're wrong.Now a question -- how is it that Bruce left the name of the E Street Band off the album cover? Certainly he's played the reunion card hard for publicity reasons. He knows that's what has jazzed the public. Yet the band doesn't warrant a cover mention? Why is it that when Diana Ross or Barbra Streisand pull a seemingly ego-inflated stunt like that, they get demolished, but Bruce doesn't even have to field the question?"
5,10 stars if I could,"Been listening and rockin' to the Boss for near 30 years and this one is right up there. Very, very solid. And to see him and the band doing these live is even more so. He did all the 15 songs plus 10 others! Highly recommend. Get the CD, see Bruce in a town near you."
1,"Yuck, rockabilly?",This album is a waste of money. With its soppy sentimental country and western like ballads it seems a far cry from the Bruce that I expected. This style is assuredly not rock and roll--even cranking up the volume did not make it more palatable. It sounds like a cross between Neil Diamond and the Oak Ridge Boys. I want a refund!
5,The E street band is back!,"I love this cd. I love all of Bruce's work.... this disc is even sweeter since the E street band is back. The only problems I have with ""The Rising"" is the rerecording of ""my city of ruins"" I think there was more emotion in the 1st version. I wish he would have put the other version on this disc. I believe (I'll be corrected if I'm wrong) ""You're missing"" is a revamped version of a song Bruce did for the Sean Penn movie ""The Crossing Guard"" which was titled ""Missing"". If ""You're Missing"" is a revamped version of ""missing""...... He should have put ""Missing"" on this disc. For me it's an emotion thing why mess with perfection? But other than those to complaints the disc is solid. My favorite tracks are: Lonesome Day, Waiting on a Sunny Day, and Lets be friends(skin to skin)."
4,Not normally a Springsteen Fan,"I haven't owned a Springsteen album since ""Born in the USA,"" which it seemed that everyone listened to in the '80's. So I'm not exactly a big fan. But I like real music, as opposed to the vanilla teeny-pop, rap-metal, and cookie-cutter-country that gets pumped out of studios like so many McNuggets these days. Springsteen has reassembled the E Street band for this album and together they really make music. It's a great full sound with complex harmonies and multiple layers. My main complaint is that the songs tend to sound somewhat the same after a while, especially the lyrics. All in all, however, this is one of the best albums of the year and worth adding to your collection."
2,Sort of a Jovi [copy],"Ever get the feeling this guy is trying to completely [copy] Bon Jovi? Cuz I do. The way Springsteen tries to play up his Jersey roots reeks of emulation of what Jovi was doing fifteen years ago, in the '80s. Also, this guy's singing style is exactly like Jovi's, as is his pub-rock sound. Little advice, Bruce: Leave the making of true Jersey hard rock to Metal Masters like Jovi.On a fair note, though, this guy has a John Cougar Mellencamp aura in his music that does resonate. He writes good tunes for the workin' man, and that's something to be admired!! Still, it's best to stick with more sincere rock that works: Jovi, Matchbox 20, and Sugar Ray.See ya!"
1,musically boring,"I love Bruce, have just about all of his albums. Even like some of the albums many others don't, like Tom Joad, Human Touch, Devils & Dust, etc. I'd never give any of his other albums fewer than 3 stars, and some are of course astounding 5-star classics (my fave is The Wild, the Innocent...).But I REALLY dislike The Rising, I just find it extremely boring musically. Basic hooks, repeated over and over. I'm all for lyrics, but first the music has to be interesting. There are a few good songs here, most notably Worlds Apart, but mostly they are just boring. Even the basic poppy songs on Born in the USA were much more advanced than this."
5,Wow,"All you need is to hear the first two tracks, lonesome day and Into the fire to understand how good this album is. Lonesome day in my mind combines all that was great about his best albums. I feel the drumming of born in the usa, the powerful repetition of born to run, the lyrics of darkness, the emotion of Nebraska, just awesome. And Into the Fire is the single best, inspirational, patriotic, 9.11 song written. I love McCartney's and Youngs songs, but Paul's is a bit cheesy and Neil's is not nearly as powerful. Into the Fire will if nothing less give you goosebumps. It made my eyes teary. - Thanks Boss"
5,"Thank You, Once, Future & Forever Boss","I haven't bought a CD the minute it went on sale in years. After reading the various interviews with Bruce, I knew I had to get out and get this new and wondrous work. Hearing it, I feel as if it is Sept 11th all over again. I feel the pain, the confusion and I feel the haunting loss. My heart breaks again for the 3,000 human beings no longer walking this earth. And for their loved ones . . .And yet there is so much joy and healing on this CD. Bruce takes us to the sorrow and shows us his version, and then he takes us to the healing that is one block down the road.God Bless this wonderful artist.It is so good to have his artistry and humanity back."
5,No Brainer,"It's interesting...and amusing....to see such a wide variety of reviews and opinions on this album....from 5 star reviews all the way down to one star reviews. It just goes to show that everyone is different, i guess. Some of the one star reviews seem to be more political ramblings than actual musical reviews....due to the fact that some of the songs are related to 9/11....but, oh well. As for me.....while i am not traditionally a big Springsteen fan... i have to say that i think this is one of the best pop/rock albums of the last 20 years or so. There is not a bad song on this entire album. I HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Five years later,"When I bought this CD, I had to wrestle with my sense that the sorrow of 9/11 ought not to be commercialized. But then I listened to the songs. I am not a Springsteen fan, but I wanted to thank him for this record. This is a decent and appropriate response to the grief and tragedy of 9/11. And I found a new appreciation for Springsteen as an artist in these songs.I attended a Springsteen concert at Giant Stadium, not far from my home, after this CD was issued. On 9/11, people parked on the highway outside the stadium and watched the smoke from lower Manhattan as it drifted northward across the skyline. But as Bruce sang these songs, the mindless mass of indifferent concert-goers tossed beach balls and drank beer.I tell the story because it points to something essential about this CD - that Springsteen here has achieved something fine with his art that most of his fans cannot appreciate. It is that good."
5,Revelant,"The songs in this album have more depth than most ""rock"" songs, but then, Mr. Springsteen usually does have depth in his songs. The title song is powerful, and the rest are quite relevant to our time. There is nothing like classic rock and roll, and this album is a classic while relevant to the present."
5,The Album is Great! The Tour is even better,"To see the full effect of the new Springsteen sound in the hands of producer Brendan O'Brien, one needs to see The Boss live. It has been said that life is full of two groups of people. Those who have seen Bruce in concert and those that haven't. To truly love this album, undergo a conversion and haul yourself to the stadium rock venue.His new tour supporting this album brings the intensity of the E Street band to full force and brings this slick, touching, poignant album to life. Bruce tells a story in concert of loss, grief, rebirth, revelation and celebration and at the end it is a party. If no video comes of this tour (and history shows that perhaps none will) then make a point to pony up the bucks ($86 !!!that is $8.60 per bandmember - an easier pill to swallow) to see the show!."
4,The rising - a very special song,"When I heared the song the first time I didn't really realized that this was a song about the 11th September 2001. But then I heared it again and then I know that the song gives hope for the people who had lost beloved people. I think the song is so successful in the USA because it shows the view of a fireman who had lost his life in the WTC. If you hear exactly to the text you could have the same feelings as the fireman. Until his dead he had hope and he thought only about his ""Mary"". For everybody who had lost a beloved person could this song be a good help to get over the pain of the 11th September because the melody isn't sad . I never heared a song before which was so emotional. It's a very wonderful song."
3,Good for Those who Like Same-Old Springsteen,"A pretty good album that will please the die-hard fans who won't let Springsteen evolve and explore. ""Empty Sky"" and ""Nothing Man"" are great tracks -- but ""Mary's Place"" and ""Waiting on a Sunny Day"" will be the crowd pleasers, since they're the type of songs people are used to from Springsteen. Listening to this, you realize how much more he's capable of as a musician and a songwriter, and he hints at it. But you also sense a restraint -- he won't let himself do another ""Nebraska."" Too bad. Let him at least try something new."
5,Jesus loves Bruce Springsteen,"Bruce, America thanks you from the bottom of our heart!Words really cannot express the magnitude of emotions that you feel when listening to this album. I have never, ever, ever heard a CD that is so rivoting!! You find yourself singing, crying, praying, and dancing.This music fills all the voids that people might be experiencing in terms of their response to Sept 11, 2001. The music & lyrics bring hope and revival to your heart. Bruce gently takes you into the depths of human loss; but then wonderfully lifts you up into the heights of heaven!You better buy a few copies 'cause you'll either 1) wear out your CD by playing it so much or; 2) want to give copies to all your friends, family, and even your attorney!"
2,Not my New York City.,"First off, I must say I am a Springsteen fan. I have all of Bruce's albums/CD's except one. I also live in New York City. So I was enthusiastic when I learned of the inspiration behind Mr. Springsteen's new album. I have to say that after listening to it twice, I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this is Bruce's tribute to NYC and the recent tragic events, but it cetainly wouldn't be my tribute to NYC. I found this album stagnant, noisy, heavy, and (within each track), repetitious. Only tracks 7 and 8, which are lighter, seem to avoid the heavy repetition. Several years ago, Billy Joel, another performer who I greatly admire, released ""The Nylon Curtain"". Like ""The Rising"", it was heavy and depressing. Billy Joel's next album, after he met Kristy Brinkly, was, in my opinion, his best. I can only hope that Bruce Springsteen can follow in these shoes."
2,Less than expected,"After hearing all the hype and media push I was expecting a ton more from this album. Being a Bruce fan from the early days, I was hoping for a return to the bigger, ""movie-like"" songs of the past. This album has Bruce again in ""simple"" mode...simple nursery-rhyme type melodies, a few boring standard chords. It all sounds so obvious. Why can't Bruce say the same message with some more interesting chord changes or a little musical flare? I'm sure the band could handle it. In some cases less is really less, Bruce. Don't believe the media...listen to your friends copy before buying this one."
2,Not so classy !,"I am not an expert on perfumes but my love for them has enabled me to distinguish between great and not so great fragrances. Dune falls in the latter category. It is NOT meant for day wear or for young/younger women. I'd call it more like an evening fragrance for more mature women. The top notes are strong enough to give someone a headache ! All of Dior's fragrances are on the musky/heavy on the senses side , so if you are someone who likes light , breezy scents - stay away."
2,like an LP record in more ways than one,"The deliberate scratches on some of the tracks are not the only similarities to old LP records. yes, like vinyl Dummy wears very thin with repeated playings. What can be fascinating over three tracks pretty soon becomes formulaic. Just like the Ramones or Status Quo in that respect. It's remarkable how some acts can stretch a good idea out over a whole album or even a whole career."
3,massively overrated,"The Portishead sound is one of barebones electronica and fragile female vocals. Nothing here is particularly original, but the album has it's virtues. It's fairly solid, with few real weak points, and the melodies are memorable. Probably as a result of this, the record has enjoyed tremendous critical aclaim. The problem is that the lyrics, which are dark but somewhat forced, give a certain contrived vibe everything. Many men won't like it either, given that it was hard (for this male, anyway) to relate to the broken, feminine persona. I confess that there were moments on this album where I just wanted to shake Beth Gibbons until she stopped whining. What's more, there are bits of surprising simplicity where there doesn't seem to be much of anything going on. For fans used to busy electronica, this may seem to be a virtue. For those of us familiar with what AC/DC is able to do with a barebones rock song, it's third rate. This album is not that great, and not for everyone."
2,--- not the best in the genre ---,Portishead might be better if Beth's vocals weren't so irritating. Listening to the shrill vocals on this CD makes you want to reach over to the stereo and throw the CD out of the window.Massive Attack is infinitely better than their Kmart imitators Portishead.
5,My favorite album of all time,This is my favorite album ever. It's one of those CD's that you can listen to over and over and not get tired of. Portishead is the best!
4,Dummy - Portishead,This is an eclectic sound. It sets the mood for romance and sitting in a place with big sofas and pillows. The vocals are very effective and leave you feeling that you've that you've heard something here that's very different. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,The mother of Trip - Hop,"This album was the soundtrack of my teenage years, and i still listen to it. Beth Gibbons sings with her soul... this is the best portishead album, and the best trip hop album ever. Love it."
5,Sour Times?,"As a whole Dummy is an amazing debut album from Portishead. Along with Massive Attack this band helped to inspire a similar sound in many other bands. Still there is something unique about Portisheads music that still makes it stand out from everything else out there. Many of the samples and instruments they use are seemingly odd picks yet help to enhance the music all the more. Beth Gibbons has an amazing voice, and the sound of the music is what makes it so great. It is on the downbeat side, probably comparable to Radiohead in the fact that some people will enjoy the music while others will think it depressing. Still I enjoy this album, and listen to it constantly and find more to love every time I play it.Mysterons, Strangers, and Roads are my favorite tracks.Their next album is also excellent, though if you found the first one to depressing you might not want to look into the second."

5,"File Under ""Everything Wrong with the US Music Industry""","Why isn't this recording available in the US now? Why is it that impossibly talented, remarkably prolific, and wholly magical artists like Ed have such an impossible time of it in the US? It can't just be American Idol and the drug-addled dinosaurs that pull the levers in the anorexic, decaying, cadaverous halls of the once powerful music industry. Or can it? If you are here, you know you are going to shell-out hard-earned money for this priceless treasure. But you must have friends, you must know people, share this music with them (in whichever way best suits your own conscience). If you are new to Ed, you are in luck! There are three deserving masterpieces (and an early glimpse at genius) available to you (and they can be had at bargain prices in the used bins)! Maybe it is just us, you, me, and Ed. If that's the situation, then we (you and me) are very fortunate souls indeed... Ed deserves more."
5,Spiritual without being religious,"This is wisdom that applies to each of us, no matter our background or beliefs. Rabbi Rami makes it clear and -- wisely -- allows us to see ourselves in this practical and pragmatic collection. I return to it often."
2,"Great bones, not enough flesh","Shapiro's ""interpretation"" of Pirke Avot is really a translation -- a lovely one, perhaps, but unadorned with analysis or commentary beyond the poetry of the words. And truly, these words are meant to be more useful than poetic, so unless you're simply looking for a modern translation of this ancient text, you'd do best to find another edition."
5,All Good,"All the songs on this album are either good or great, so if you're looking for a hiphopgood album look no further...Maybe too many skits but you can always skip them...best songs: daddy gotta get that cash, lick a shot and that track dedicated to his dead brother... but really most songs are great..."
2,Ok...It's another L.O.X. cd!,"Not for nothing I really don't want to waste too much time on this review. It's your classic case of nothing new or special. ""Styles"" continues to tell street story as he does with ""The Lox""(boring). I was truly jaded with the lyrics and was disappointed with the overall production of the CD. I would have gave this CD a one rating but I love ""The Life"" and I love the beat to ""Good Time"". ""Get Paid"" made me nauseous having little children singing a hook containing lyrics: ""Can I get paid, I'm just trying to make some cash, I'm just trying to make some cash."" It was a slap to my ears to even hear children deliver such a poisonous message. Then ""Styles"" attempts to offer his listener a song for thought named ""Listen"". Damage was done with ""Get Paid"", make up your mind either be ""A Gangster OR A Gentleman."""
5,Styles The True Gangsta,"Ruff Ryders are coming out bangin. Jada's solo Lp wasn't all i thought it was going to be, but this styles p is off the hook!! I love that east coast gangsta rap and they do it the best. Also watch out for the young J-Hood he can ""flow"". From the song ""Lick Shots"" he says "" Lick a shot for all my...in the slums blowin spliffs with razor blades under they tounge"" All-in-all if you like that gangsta rap check Styles P ,Jadakiss, Sheek, and J-Hood. Oh Yeah... ROCAFELLA, YOU CAN""T TOUCH 'EM !"
2,"Short, outdated, and dry, but get past it and it's okay.","As I stepped into the worlds of well-to-do leather jacket wearing Marie, and the abusive home of ""whitetrash"" Lena, I realized that this book wasn't exactly ""up to par"" by the standards of young reader books today.In order to relate to the reader, the author must know the world of teenagers, not just guess as it is evident Woodson did. The leather boots and jackets, the cupcakes in class are all outdated, and ruined a perfectly good book.It seemed Woodson tried to condense the book into a shorter version than it originally had been planned. Overall, the book was not as insightful or intersting as I had expected, just basically the life of two confused pubescents, which, to the supposed reader, is nothing new"
3,I was bothered,"As an adult, I enjoyed this book for its full development of character and the bond shared between the girls. But also, I was extremely bothered that Marie didn't decide to tell an adult about Lena's abusive father. This, to me, seems like the kind of secret that one must tell in order to really be a friend. Running away just doesn't solve it. Lena and her sister needed professional help (as did Marie, in my opinion) and I would hate for a young adult to follow in Marie's footsteps and keep a secret such as this private."
5,A great CD for singer-songwriter fans,"I picked up this CD because I am a Sarah McLachlan fan, and this was recommended to me. I didn't regret it. Shawn's music is tuneful, upbeat and invariably catchy, and her lyrics are thoughtful and memorable. On top of all this, her voice is soulful and moving. Recommended to all fans of intelligent music."
5,A match was lit!,"Colvin's first track, ""Sunny Came Home,"" is pure brilliance in its complexity and symbolism, but I just noticed something upon listening to this song just moments ago: at the very end of the song, you can hear a real match being lit, and being blown out, completely relevant to the lyrics. It's very subtle, but it adds to the song's significance.Artists like Colvin are great in that new things and new meanings can be found within their songs upon repeated listenings."
5,Shawn Colvin Is great!,Shawn Colvin has a style that can't really be classified. Her music almost has a haunting quality about it. This is my favorite of hers. I have listened to so many times that I know it by heart. I am always excited when at my age (no longer young) I can still find music that can pull me in to another world.
2,Colvin's Worst Album Still OK by Everyone Else's Standards,"What are you guys talking about? ""Sunny Came Home"" is not a great song, no matter how many times it gets played on the radio. Interestingly, the better songs on this CD are the ones without a co-writer (John Leventhal). Did Leventhal purposely make this album worse in production that it already was? I'm glad Shawn Colvin won a Grammy, because I thought she deserved one for ""Steady On"", but not for this CD. It's weak compositionally and performance-wise. (Perhaps the cigarette in her hand on the back cover has something to do with it?) Then again, I'm judging Colvin by the high standard that she set for herself early on. It's just too bad she hasn't been able to meet that standard again."
4,38 Killer Jungle Beats,"If you are into fast paced music this are the tracks for you. I've used them in my SPINNING classes and their great tracks, worth-it!"
4,Fascinating idea...,"Robert Hanson, a researcher who heads up a team monitoring a space probe, gets strange data and even a video of an extra-terrestrial ship which stuns the team. But, his company wants it kept quiet. Why?This near-future novel gets more and more involved as Hansen is drummed out of work and suspects a conspiracy. He's right, but he has no idea HOW high the conspiracy goes. Ed Lerner, a research engineer, has woven a Crichton-like story with intelligence and science that keeps you reading chapter after chapter..IF you like this kind of stuff.Lerner certainly know HIS stuff..the tech is spot-on and readers may quibble with some things, but generally it's a good bedtime/airplane/vacation read."
4,Great for little readers!,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday. She loves to be read to and this was the perfect gift for her. It is very easy for her to change the cartridges and books. I wish the books weren't $20 a 3 pack, but we just got the Dora 3 pack at Target on clearance ($5). The books are durable and the Story Reader is easy to carry for little ones. This is great for all the long car rides we go on, headphones can be plugged into it.There are instances when our daughter turns the page, and it doesn't register so we have to flip to the previous page, and back again. I rated the educational value a 2 only because it's not interactive, but anything that entices a child to read it a plus for me!All in all it is a great gift for any kid who loves to read or be read to."
5,High Praise For Come Joy!,"This work is definitely a book you must read over and over. I have several favorites, including, ""Meditation"", ""My Love is a Song"", and all the ones describing the author's great love for family and special frienships. The title piece in the final chapter on the spiritual relationship with the Creator, is also a favorite, and Ms. Wynn's earnest invocation of the Spirit throughout is evidence of the connection she desires to make and maintain in sharing the gift she's been blessed with. The poems in the collection minister to the soul in different ways, encouraging and instructing, edifying and uplifting and especially in the soft of my own nights, these poem confirm what the heart has always known. There is joy in the morning. A must read for people who enjoy good literature that speaks to the heart."
5,one of the top 10 books on Monroe--Cunningham really does it,"The book market is flooded with Monroe works, as everyone knows. However, there are several ""must have"" volumes, and Ernest Cunningham's work is definitely on that list. The book provides the reader with a wealth of information, divided into easily understood sections which, in turn, will lead the reader to virtually every book ever printed dealing with this screen goddess. Cunningham's research is both broad and impeccable, not duplicated anywhere else on the market. His writing is clean and clear with a tongue-in-cheek touch that is entertaining while also being informative. This book is truly ""essential"" for any Monroe fan or collector and would also be of high interest for the less devoted who simly want to know a bit more about the ""why"" and ""how"" of the Monroe legend."
5,"Sugarfree, Quick & Easy! is so much more than just recipes","I would recommend the book Sugarfree, Quick & Easy! to anybody who loves to eat but wants to be healthy. I was at Edgewater Mall here (in Biloxi, Miss.) and caught a free seminar that was given by the author, Deanie Comeaux Bahan. She has written several books about maintaining a sugar free lifestyle. Her cookbook Sugarfree, Quick & Easy! is so much more than just recipes. It is helping me already with terrific time saving tips for shopping and cooking. Thanks to this book, I have learned how to start and keep up a no sugar life, which is perfect for me, since sugar is something I am not supposed to eat! Deanie answered questions from the audience and explained the glycemic index so even I can understand it now! And the index is printed in this book. Since using Sugarfree, Quick & Easy! recipes, I am making great meals that don't show up on my waistline."
2,amazing,"this is, without a boudt, the best and heaviest record ever. my favorite song is 'fishing for haggis' this is a really bad record though, there arent even any pictures on it. i do however, recommend this to anyone over 21, but i DO NOT recommend that ANYOEN get this overall its still my favorite cd"
5,Inspiring,"We in the western world really have no clue what it is like to suffer for our faith. These women are testimonies to a faith and trust in Jesus that stretches beyond ""earthly reason"" For they not only suffered persecution themselves, but in some instances have been witnesses to the torcher and murder of loved ones, because they refused to reject their faith. I have never known such anguish as they have experienced, and yet, remain faithful. This is an inspiring read. May it change your life as it has mine."
4,The Tsunami is Here...,"Leonard Sweet is more than qualified to write such a book. His experience as professor and dean of the theological school at Drew University ,as well as his various graduate and seminary degrees, have prepared him for this study. He is writing primarily to pastors and church leaders. His mission is to encourage us to look beyond the present status of the church to the future. He pushes us to move past the buildings, programs, and traditions of the church. The overarching theme of the book is that pastors and churches will have to take a new approach to ministry in this new age in which we live. There will have to be a radical transformation in our thinking, preaching, outreach, and overall philosophy of ministry if we are to be effective.Paul Heier, author of Leading Out of Love"
2,One New Englander's opinion...,"Having lived my whole life in Massachusetts between Nashoba, Groton and Chelmsford, I was quite dissapointed with the book's lack of details about actual events of the war.Lepore generates some excellent insights into early Colonial society in NE and its attitudes towards Native Americans, but the lack of any timeline for the events of the war makes the book very difficult to follow. The book is really more of an essay about perceptions of war rather than what actually took place.The reader receives bits of information about important conflicts only sparingly. The majority of the book contains detailed perceptions and quotes about the war from significant people of the time. I was left craving for more details about the actual events of the war that never materialized.A positive aspect of the book is that it is very thought provoking overall and really makes the reader question the perceptions of war from many historical accounts."
2,And this mess won a Bancroft?,"The Bancroft is the history profession's Pulitzer, so I was looking forward to being edified. What I got instead was an impenetrable tome consisting mainly of fashionable deconstructionist babble about how war is defined among different cultures. I read and read and never found a coherent narrative about what this war was supposed to be about or what it had to do with American identity.Perhaps this ""language of academe"" impressed the Bancroft committee, itself made up of pedants, but to the common reader, whom the academy putatively serves, this thing is worthless. I have the feeling that these guys began reading, and when their eyes started to glaze over they said, ""My kind of history!"""
1,Negative views and filled with gore,"I recently read this book for a Colonial American History class and unfortunately had to write a paper on it. I would never have read it otherwise. Lepore's thesis argued that the language and words of war are used to create the identity of a group of people.It is possible for an historian to analyze and interpret primary documents and form an arguement without exposing an apparent bias against a group or groups of people. Lepore failed in this aspect. As her arguement unfolded, the negative views against the Puritans were clearly present from her remarks concerning the Mathers to the stripping of the Puritan's cultural background.While this book is not necessarily about King Philip's War, it is filled with gore. So if you would like a literary treatment of bloody massacres or if revisionist history is your preference, read this book. If not, find something else."
1,Pseudo-Scholarly Treatment,"I started this book, thinking that it would give me a background in understanding this important episode in English/Indian history. However, I got so disgusted by the author's seeming attribution of every possible event in this period to one particular individual (Sassamon) that I quit reading it. Example: On pg. 33f, Eliot wrote of three Natick Indians who got drunk. The author implies (with no evidence) that one of them was Sassamon (""If he committed these shameful ... then Sassamon would have sorely disappointed Eliot""). I practically never stop reading a book, but in this case I made an exception."
5,A Keeper,"I was introduced to this band after seeing some of their videos on VH-1 during a recent trip to England, and their songs immediately caught my attention. After reading some of the reviews of this CD on this website I was persuaded to buy it, and I certainly haven't regretted my decision. The songwriters have a gift for melody that is nothing short of amazing, and with several talented band members sharing lead vocals the variation is refreshing. I find myself playing this CD over and over..."
4,Disgraced hero seeking redemption,"Disgraced CIA agent Charlie McKenzie had waited years for his former employer to call him and when it happened, Charlie made his employer pay big to bring him out of his mundane existence. Charles is ordered to find a young inexperience Russian female agent and to bring her back with the secrets she has stolen.Accepting the assignment, Charles real motives are to clear his name and to receive the recongnition he truly deserves. If it meant aiding the Russian agent, then so be it.I first noticed Joseph R. Garber through his novel Vertical Run and wondered if Whirl Wind would even come close to the excitement and entertainment of Vertical Run. It has. Whirl Wind is far different, but the story, characters and writing is just as thrilling.The Friday HouseXiiiLost Hours"
2,Too Much Foul Language for me,"I was very excited to find this book because I loved Vertical Run (have read it 3 times at least) but quit half way through because it had too much foul language. I understand people swear in the real world and I think sometimes it can be forceful, but for me I chose to stop reading."
2,"Brazilian soft-pop; late-era ""brega"" music","Joanna""Joanna""(RCA-Brasil, 1991)------------------------------Dreadful soft pop from Brazil; includes a Portuguese-language cover of ""Killing Me Softly With His Song.""

4,"Love it, but have some questions....","First, my question: I have downloaded quite a few songs from Walmart, and they won't play on my player. I think it has something to do with the licensing of the songs from Walmart, or something. Even when I play them on my computer, it takes a little while for them to load as they check for a license or something. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong, or how to fix it?Other than that, the player is great. It's small, stylish, and has pretty good sound. The earbud wires are a little short for the arm band I use it with, but other than that, I like it. Battery life is excellent, and there are plenty of features packed into such a small player. I use it at the track and gym, and it has gotten plenty sweaty and worked just fine. It's also easy to read at night when I'm out walking. I'd recommend it. I had an Ipod, which I also liked, but it broke. This has been a more than adequate replacement."
3,sponge bob trading cards,"I used this product to potty train my younger brother. It worked very well he is now potty trained. The cards didn't last too long, but u can't expect them to in a two year oles hands."
2,not worth it,"This book is not good at the following things: 1. analyzing Kurt Vonnegut (as literature) 2. understanding and analyzing chaos theory 3. analyzing chaos theory in Kurt Vonnegut 4. living up to its titleIt is worth a look for the die-hard Vonnegut fans, but if you are interested in chaos theory, this is not the book for you."
2,Fair - cheap imitation,"Product very cheaply made. No comparison to other brands. The filter has no structure, unlike other filters, which allows it to collapse upoon installation."
4,Great introduction to an author,"Never heard of David Hunt, but was intrigued by reader ratings.A bold approach to subjects usually treated marginally, if at all, in the mystery genre (commercial homosexuality, androgeny, incest, butchery). Fascinating characters, developed with rare empathy. Complex plot, well-executed. Wrapping up the loose ends (the search for Ariane)was a slow-down & a let-down, but a small price to pay for a narrative I found nearly impossible to put down, even while Tiger Woods was on my TV screen performing his form of magic.I will pursue the Kay Farrow series with the expectation of continued enjoyment. I hope Hunt drops Sasha, who seems present only to show Kay's heterosexuality."
3,Knob is so Childish,"After finishing the whole book in a day I still wonder why on earth the villian, Knob is so snobbish and easy. He should be tough and street wise but at the end the guy seemed to be so effiminate and easy"
5,V just has it!,"You'll love reading her honest,real and sexy diary. Her story is all about her secret crush, how her husband stray into the arms of other woman and more exciting... secrets she'll revel!"
3,Not as good as the other two in the trilogy,"I had been waiting patiently (sometimes unpatiently) for the third book of this trilogy. I absolutly loved My Steadfast Heart and My Reckless Heart, but this one just wasn't as good. I didn't like Berkey and Grey like I ABSOLUTLY LOVED Colin and Mercedes and LOVED Decker and Jonna almost as much. The book didn't have much depth and a few times I didn't understand where the story was going. Although, if you are a fan of this series, it is a MUST READ!"
5,This is my FAVORITE JT album... and I have many!,"This album consist of about five or six tracks that you just can't stop listening to. From the insightful ""Secret O' Life"" to the ever-so enchanting ""If I Keep My Heart Out Of Sight,"" JT delivers an always emotional, honest performance. It's not very often that you find an album that you can let play through its entirety. The majority of the album is so good, I can even forgive him for ""Honey Don't You Leave L.A."""
4,Memoirs from the Maestro.,"Barry White's life wasn't all love and togetherness as his many hits have prescribed to any lovers out there, but still, having fought his way out of poverty by binding his love of life with his true love of music paved the way to him becoming the icon he will always be. Yeah, there may be a little ego, but he deserves it. Barry's struggle from Compton to being swindled as an employee of a toy store to the dissolution of his first marriage may have broken his spirit, but made him a better man. The most interesting part of his life was the business aspect, especially the parts that dealt with the record company dismissing him and not wanting to acknoledge his gifts, yet reaping the millions of dollars he was making them. Filled with highs and lows, this autobiography wasn't the best I ever read, but made the closer look at Barry's life intriquing."
1,NONONONONO!!!!,"horrible horrible quality... cant adjust wire tension, and it arrived quite loose...just a bother all over, ended up throwing away that same week they came in the mail..."
1,Norpro Cheese Slicer Review,"This product is useless and worthless. Is very difficult to replace the wire, and the wire is very fragile, break easily."
3,Cheese cutter,"Cut beautiflly when new, but after much use the wire stretched out and we were unable to tighten it back up"
1,Already broken,"My son was trying to adjust this tool after we had owned it for about a week. The roller wouldn't tighten properly. He used a little more force and it broke. Before it broke, the size of the roller was an issue. The block of cheese being sliced would chill the roller. Moisture would condense on it. Thin slices would stick to the roller and get wrapped around it. Our old slicer with a smaller diameter roller didn't have this problem.Not recommended."
2,Clumsy,This cheese slicer is too heavy and clumsy to use. Its hard to maintain even slices of cheese.
2,Lasted less than a year--wire broke,Fairly good slicer but nowhere near as good as some of these reviews said. Hard to make thin slices. Then it broke.
3,Sturdy but Flawed,This slicer is very sturdily built and I expect to get years of use out of it. My complaints are that the wire is a bit to thick and the roller too sticky.I am sure the wire will last much longer than a thinner one would but it tends to tear the cheese as it exits the block. I would have made the compromise between functional and durable a little farther to the functional end of the scale.The adjustment range on this slicer is huge but it cannot cut slices as thin as the depth adjustment allows. The aluminum roller is so sticky that thin slices roll up around it. With extreme care reasonably thin slices can be cut but the process is fussier than it should be.Even with it's shortcomings this is a very good slicer. I have an Oxo as well (that only cuts slabs) but I almost always reach for this one first. Now that I have given up on super thin slices we are at peace.
1,Disappointed,The first time I used this product to produce a slice of cheese the wire loosened. I thought I could just tighten the screw that held the wire in place but the nut it was attached to was stripped. Useless at this point.
3,Slow Going,"This is a haunting and sad book...the writing is skilled and evocative, the characters are interesting. But it is SO evocative that I found myself depressed every time I entered the stark and dreary world that Buchan so skillfully creates. Even the gardening bits failed to offset the general miasma of gloom that permeates this book, at least for me. Buchan is a fine writer, but this book is hard going, albeit beautifully written. It has a Bronte-like feel, but without the passion. And the ghostly elements left me unmoved, which is unusual for me. Read it for the fine writing, but don't expect a quick or lighthearted experience."
4,gggeah 2,This album is a must have. West coast gansta Rap at it's finest. In my opinion this is his best album.
4,Define the other side?,"Some real good Moody magic on three or four songs here. A couple of others are good, and The Spirit was NOT!"
1,Kids under construction,I was highly dissatisfied. I thought I was getting a song book with piano accompaniement. and I don't know what you call the book they sent me. It is nothing I can use.....
1,waste of time!!!,"This movie was absolutely horrible, I am a big fan of horror movies and i saw this in the theaters and have never been so close to walking out, I probably would have if my mom wasnt in another movie at the time. I can't beleive this movie has 3 1/2 stars it was so unoriginal, Every person he killed was like one shot and they are dead. Not to mention the horrible acting and the cheesy attempt to use 3d just made it worse."
1,My Bloody Valentine 2009 remake.,"My Bloody Valentine 1981- the original and the best, the remake is awful. I hate remakes, that being said, I watched the remake of the movie and didn't care much for it, I like the original, It's way better. I don't care if the remake is 3D OR 4D.Enough With the Remakes!"
3,"Good movie, disappointing 3D","I bought this DVD because I saw My Bloody Valentine in 2D in theaters and I really liked it. The film itself is a pretty good horror/chase flick, especially these days when most horror movies are 100% predictable and have very little plot behind them. So this movie was a breath of fresh air. I didn't get to see the movie in 3D but was excited when I saw that I could purchase teh DVD in 3D with the accompanying 3D glasses. However, the 3D is hardly notable and you might as well just purchase a 2D version, unless you can get this one for less money then by all means get this one."
1,Do not waste your money,"Do not waste your money. They shouldn't advertise this as a 3D movie, it is not! Its like watching. Bad copy of a rated B movie. Wish I could get a refund...."
4,Awesome movie!,My Bloody Valentine 3D/2D FlipAwesome movie. 3D effects are great! Movie comes with 4 pairs of glasses!
4,My Bloody Valentine 3-D,"Not a bad movie, but it was a little long for a slasher flick. The 3-D parts were good but could've been better. The 3-d glasses with the movie are a nice feature so you don't have to get some."
4,Very surprised,"I must have missed this when it hit the theaters, I just bought it because I had seen the original when I was a kid and thought that they just released it on blu-ray in 3d.Well, I was very surprised that it was actually a remake.. and actually a very good remake. I jumped straight to watching it in 3d on my samsung 55 inch LED and after watching coraline in red/blue 3d this was so much better. The 3d was a lot better than I would have expected with a red/blue filter.As for the film, I actually liked it better than the first. Most of the movie was redone, but they kept a lot of key elements in the movie (including a version of the dryer scene). This is one of those horror flicks that I'll watch again and again"
4,Not worth the 3-D without an LCD tv,"The movie was great, but don't bother watching the 3-D version unless you have an LCD tv. I tried it on 2 different tv's and the 3-D technology sucked. It was blurry and all red and green. I watched it on my computer with my LCD monitor and it was almost perfect. I don't know what the deal with that is, but they might want to fix that in the future if they want to release movies in 3-D."
2,Too Bloody Valentine,"Good move, but could've been better with different actors playing the sheriff and Hannigan Jr. Neither has the screen presence to play lead roles like they did in this movie. The movie was also strained and stretched. Unlike the original, this move revolved too much around the killing as opposed to a story with a motivated serial killer. Had the producers redid the original, but only modernized it with cell phones and such, this one would've been better. The original is a classic. As usual , in most modern slasher flicks, the producers substitute blood and guts for a good story. This is one I wish I had rented before I bought, but is not a wasted purchase. Not a sleeper, a keeper, but could've been better."
4,THE SCORE,"EXCELLENT MUSIC, BUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE RAP. THE LYRICS ARE A LITTLE GRAPHIC BUT NOT BAD. PARENTAL DISGRESSION IS ADVISED. BUT FOR THE MOST PART IS A GOOD CD."
1,"Oh Doctor, the irony!! (No Stars)","I believe this country has a problem with what it considers racism to be, and this album shows that the musical industry is no exception. The Lead-singing lady of this band made the comment that she doesn't want white people to buy her records, going so far as saying that she would rather have her children starve than have their food bought with the dirty money of the white people of this country. Of course no one made the attempt of calling her racist, because that's the way this country's media has been controlled lately.Musically, the album is not that bad. I'm going off what I heard on the radio a few years back. But there are tons of albums out there that aren't ""bad."" It's what you say in your music, what you do with it, the message you try to convey that makes the album. And if this woman is trying to show that color can still segregate us, does the album deserve more than one star? Too bad not all music can be for everyone..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST !,"The Fugees are definitely the most complete group of all times. TLC, WuTang, etc all are real good groups, however The Fugees integrated every form of music into rap and made hiphop globally respected. Their themes and videos were the best of all times. The Score is really a street classic. From "" Ready or not"", cowboys, ""the beast"". Everything is tight. Lauryn is fascinating though. She really makes fugees what it all is. their breakup is a great loss to the enrichment of hiphop."
5,Their Burstin on the scene album,"The fugees (w Lauryn Hill) bursted on the scene with this album. Killing me softly with his song, Ready or Not and Fu gee la are the tracks that make this a all star album. Buy It!"
4,FUGEES A Wonderful Start,"I am giving this albums a 4 stars. I was torn. This albums flows very well. My Favorite songs are Killing Me Softly, with the Exceptionally Talented Lauren Hill. Fugeela, The Score. There allot of messages on this album. A great assemble with Wyclef and Pras. You can feel there flow. There is a song for every one. But, I would recommend this album for young adult the mature individual. The language just takes away from the pure magic that flows with the music.I just wish there wasn't so much explict language but you cannot deny this Group Wonderful Talent.I look forward to there next album. Hopefully, soon.Anything Lauren and Wyclef touches turns to magic. Pras holds his own.If you are a Fugee fanatic. This is a must buy. If you want to delve deep into the minds of some talented artist this is a good start for a music lover collection."
5,The best Wagner excerpts program since Karajan,"Can it really be that Wagner orchestral concerts, once a staple of the catalog, are now so rare? James Levine has a good one from the Met on DG that replicaates the usual ovetures an preludes. This collection from Abbado is graced with a rarity--a compilation of orchestral music from Parsifal Act III, the summation of the hero's spiritual journey.For that music alone, which Abbado conducts gorgeously, with smooth, flowing line and an almost impressoinistic veil of shimmering sound, I am grateful. His style of Wagner is the antithesis of Klemperer's--no granite here, only a seamless river of melody. The Berlin Phil. is, as usual, splendid in Wagner, which Karajan recorded often. This CD is a great contribution to their legacy."
3,kind of hit and miss,"I love Ryman's style, but way too much of this book is dedicated to NOT beautiful creatures; various monsters and undead critters and the like. The women that ARE in here, though, are beautifully drawn, and very good for art reference and (ahem) other reference."
3,For hard core fans only,"Until I found it in a discount CD store I never knew this CD existed. I didn't see a review for it in any of the local media and it was never mentioned in any articles about Susanna which is telling.It is an interesting departure from ""when you're a boy"" but for me none of the songs have the spark of her first CD. The arrangements also don't highlight her voice (which is Susanna's best asset as a performer) as strongly.Worth buying for hard core Hoff fans to complete their collection"
4,"mmmm, candy","This pop confection is tasty stuff. Plus, queers must rock! How long I have waited for a male voice to sing something like ""you kiss me like a man, boy"" and then turn dark with ""you take it like a man, boy."" Sinister and wry. Plus you can dance to it. Roddy Bottum is the man and so am I."
4,"Bow down to me, bow down, yeah, baby baby!","The debut of ""Imperial Teen"" was one of my favorite albums on 1996. It's sly and subversive, aggressive and funny, and most importantly, smart. Ranging from a punk blast worthy of The Ramones (""Waterboy"") to psychedelic pop (""Balloon""), these four San Franciscans make very gay friendly music. Lyrics like ""Kiss me like a man, boy"" or ""the prince wants to be a queen"" (which seemingly was about Kurt Cobain, who was a friend of keyboardist Roddy Bottum) sneak by before you realize exactly what you're singing along to. There's literally nothing to compare this to..which makes me recommend it all the more. Long Live ""Imperial Teen!"""
1,No Go,"Downloaded fine. But when I tried to play, the screen blacked out and then I window popped up saying 'DIRECTX ERROR'. So I don't know. I've played the game before and its a great game! But its only a great game when you can play it."
2,"May have been an ok game for then, but doesnt compare now","Total Annihilation is not that great. Sure there are millions of men your army can consist of, but many are very weak and useless. There is really no depth to the game, its just one of those games where whoever can build the best man first wins no contest. Compared to games of today like Starcraft and Homeworld this game stands no chance. I think I was being very generous giving it 2 stars. I wouldnt waste my money."
3,Not an engaging book,"I started off reading Georgette Heyer's historical romances and am a big fan, and have in the past few years started reading her mystery books, which are more contemporary (early to mid 20th century). Most of them are quite entertaining, and you see some of the same characters pop up (especially Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant/Inspector Hemingway). However, I felt that this book was a letdown. The first two-thirds of the book was somewhat interesting but I found the last part of the book when the murderer and the motive was revealed very dry and boring. None of the characters were memorable. I'd recommend reading Death in the Stocks, They Found Him Dead and Behold, Here's Poison instead."
3,Rear pockets rip on every pair I've owned!,"The outside top of the rear pockets have ripped on EVERY pair I've purchased fairly quickly. And I'm not talking a small little tear, I'm talking you're hanging out there! Funny thing is I'm not using them for construction, I'm using them for regular day to day use and I don't put anything in the back pockets! The fit is fantastic but something needs to be done about the construction of the back pockets (or get some REALLY long sweatshirts)."
4,"James, the brother of Jesus","There is much controversy about much of these books as all the names used are very familiar to all of Israel. Most of what has been collected is bone boxes with inscription on all and some authenicated and some not. James was one of four brothers of Jesus. Jesus also had two half sisters as well, but the Catholic Church only says they are cousins and none of that is authenicated either. Iampresently reading several books of this nature."
3,Um... We Didn't Get Anywhere...,"I picked this up, expecting something dramatic and impressive. Instead I found it was a book of conjecture. I certainly learned a lot about the world of antiquities and about James, but that was about it.No one actually knows anything about the box one way or the other and given that everything they think they know is just one person's opinion, I felt like I didn't get anywhere.It's a decent read, but I certainly wouldn't buy it or recommend it."
1,Homework wasn't done.,"The problems with Witherington's explanation of the central point of this book are so numerous, the Catholic Answers website devoted a whole article to it called ""Bad Aramaic Made Easy."" Witherington claims that there is an Aramaic word for cousin, much to the amazement of Aramaic scholars, and he makes this baseless assertion without ever telling us of the Aramaic word he has in mind!The only redeeming quality of this book is that the co-author, Shanks, undercuts Witherington's claims. The authors should have consulted experts and each other."
4,Nicely constructed wire with speaker pins to avoid oxidation.,"The Belkin PureAV 16-gauge speaker wire is a good gauge speaker wire comparable to Monster for moderate lengths. Unfortunately there are no instructions on the packaging demonstrating how to install supplied pins--none are available at website either.You will need a very small Hex-wrench to undo the screws under the red and black covers. Twist the speaker wire and insert into pins, then retighten the screws. The pins will stay on tight."
3,Don't get too attached to the night light~!,I thought this monitor was the greatest invention - with the night light next to the bed for night time diaper changes and the automatic 15 minute shut off - but my baby is only 5 weeks old and the light has burned out already! Apparently it is some special light that cannot be replaced unless you buy another receiver. I rarely use the monitor so I guess I should have just bought a night light!
2,Started out OK - then just became worse,"I registered for this monitor and received as a gift. It started out with a little static in the beginning and I just thought that was ""normal"". It just became worse. Our daughter is now 15 mths and it finally gave out about 2 months ago. We're expecting another and won't waste our money on another one like this."
1,"CAN""T HEAR BABY OVER STATIC!",We received this monitor as a shower gift. I can hear my son crying myself before I can hear him on the monitor! There is SO MUCH static we don't even bother with it any more. We just leave the door open a little and keep an ear out. Don't waste your money or some one elses!
3,Light didn't last 2 weeks,"The reception is great on this monitor, but one reason we bought this was for the light and it was officially dead as of week 2. We also had the strobe-light problem that another reviewer mentioned for the 2 weeks that the light did actually work. However we had thrown out the box so it was un-returnable."
1,If there was a zero star I would have used that,"It doesn't work. I played with it plugging it into 4 different plugs trying to get it to work and all it is, is loud and FUZZY!! I will be bringing it back. What a waste of time and money!"
2,Buy another monitor,"This wasn't the monitor we registered for, but the one we wanted wasn't in stock. We thought this might be of similar quality but we were sorely mistaken. All we usually get is static. Second, it has a loud buzz sound it makes when it isn't picking up static. It does have a night light effect that lasts for a few minutes when you turn it on or just touch the button. It also picks up sound good, you just have to listen over the static or look at the red light indicator to tell if the baby is stirring. We are looking for another monitor because that annoying buzz keeps me up at night."
5,Great monitor,"I registered for this monitor because a friend of mine uses it and likes it. My son was born premature and came home on oxygen, and the fact that he was hooked up to heart rate and apnea monitors was somewhat comforting, because I would know right away if something was wrong with him. Now that he's off the oxygen, I have the comfort of this monitor when I'm not near the him. I've gotten NO static whatsoever, and I can actually hear him breathing. I also like that there are two receivers, so I can keep one in the basement plugged in all the time for when I'm doing something down there.This is the only monitor I've tried, so I can't compare it to others out there, but I'm happy with it so far. And the price is right, too!"
2,IT's alright,"This montior does work well. I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. It works outside, upstairs and down. The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive."
1,Static City,"IF you are looking to hear static this is the monitor for you!!! Otherwise, don't waste your money. I received this as a shower gift and didn't use until several months later. Now it is too late to return. I definately have to go out and purchase another monitor in hopes that I can actually hear my child!!!"
1,"Horrible monitor, poor distance, tons of static",I literally could not take the monitor 10 feet away from the base without getting tons of nasty static making it impossible to hear anything.I isolated the cause to the base station. It does not put out a powerful enough signal. I have an older Playskool base station that operates on the same channel. The receivers from this set pick it up FINE. However they will NOT work at all with the base station that comes with the set.Someone poorly designed this set. Use only if you have no electronic devices in your house and live in the middle of nowhere.
1,Don't Buy This Monitor,"Our monitor worked for only three weeks! Unfortunately we threw the box and receipt out so we couldn't return it. The first week we used it we were picking up random people on telephones and their conversations. Then we got it to work better (a bit clearer) for a week or two, and then after that it was very staticky until it finally just burnt out. The only positive feature was the glow light that turned off after 10 minutes or so on the main receiver that we kept in the baby's room. Otherwise - stay clear of this product unless you want a neat night light."
2,Pure Garbage!,"This monitor has alot of static and you pick- up other monitors in the neighborhood! It has only 2 channels( not much privacy!) i wish i had bought one of the 900 mgh monitors instead! In fact i am looking for new monitors now to replace these ones! Please, don't waste your money here!"
2,Not very pleased!!,"Our Sony monitor died and we had to purchase a new one. I was really happy with the Sony monitor, but decided to try another brand. Big mistake! There is so much static with this monitor that it drives me crazy. We get woken up in the middle of the night with loud static! It is convenient that their are two receivers, however the static does not justify the convenience. I'm taking mine back and getting the Sony."
3,"Great, unless you get interference","When this moniter doesn't pick up interference with our own and the neighbors' cordless phones and other things, it is great - extrememly sensitive and clear. We have had to go shopping for another model with a higher frequency because most days there is so much interference all you hear is static or a high-pitched screaching sound. It was a lesson to us...shop for one that uses the highest frequency you can find. May not be an issue for those who live far away from others, I'm not sure."
2,All Static,"While the reviews for this monitor seemed mostly positive, the monitor was all static (on both channels) even with the receiver in the same room. We returned it an bought the Sony - a much better product."
1,Cheap and short lived,"Do not buy this monitor if you are looking for something to last. Our first receiver stopped working after a month of use. We have had this for 6 months now and the connection comes loose all the time to to receiver so it just turns off. ALthough it has a battery compartment, it does not work on the battery alone. It is just static. Spend a little more and buy better quality than this brand."
1,Didn't last long,"I checked reviews for monitors on every website I could find. This one seemed to have high ratings everywhere I looked, so it's what we got. We have a 2 story, so it seemed necessary to have two receivers. After 1 month, one of them stopped working. We did figure out that we could put a tiny nail in beside the volume dial and turn it up almost all the way, and it would sometimes work.Now, our baby is 5 months old and the other one is doing the very same thing. We are going to have to buy a new one because it goes out too much. I'll wake up in the middle of the night, and it's not working at all. We are extremely disappointed in it."
1,Worthless Monitor!,"After reading many reviews on many different monitors we chose this monitor because it had mostly great reviews... We are so sorry we purchased this monitor now!Half the time all we can hear is a high pitch noise or static and nothing from our baby.. It works when it wants to.. We have tried moving the base and nothing helps. It is worthless. We are now debating on buying a new, more expensive monitor system.If you decide to purchase this monitor-save the box and paperwork so you can return it for a different one. You will be glad you did. We didn't and are regretting it!"
2,I've had better,"These were not impressive 400-thread count sheets. I was expecting a much softer feel, but it is more like sandpaper! I washed several times to see if it softens up, but not. They are pretty, but I doubt the validity of the 400-thread count claim. I wish I would have used the same amount of money to buy just one set of better quality sheets!"
5,Great game,"This is simply the best game that I have ever played. Two sides, and more units total than all of starcraft combined. Very, very easy to mod. The sheer bulk of... stuff that can be downloaded for it... There are more total conversions than I can count one one hand(A total conversion removes all old units and replaces them.) The bulk of individual units that can be downloaded for it is ridiculous. The biggest problem with the modding is that there is a limit of 512 different units that can be added to each side. Maps can be pulled as well. They are huge. Up and past 40X40 screens. Don't buy it here, hit ebay. 99$ for an eight year old game?"
2,How do you rate it if it is never in stock?,"The lamp shade looks like it would be nice, but we have been looking for it for months in the Babies R Us store to no avail. They say they have no idea when it will come in since the distribution center doesn't even have them. I just saw that there were only two left in stock on-line, but it is a bit frustrating to have to pay shipping and tax when ordering it on-line. We ran into the same thing with the Valence."
3,Probability and Statistics for Grad Students,"We have been using this text in my Probability Theory class this semester, and it is very difficult to follow the book at all. In the introduction the authors state this book is intended for graduate students and I believe they are correct. They assume that you really know your calculus, from integration to derivatives to series and sequences. Their examples are not very clear."
2,Exam P,"I bought this book for my BYU STAT470 class. The class is designed to prepare you for SOA Exam P, but I found the book hard to navigate and really doesn't offer much in the form of exam practice. I feel that the ACTEX manuals are a much better resource for learning Exam P material."
3,Super Reader,"Gees is a bored adventurer. When his administration person tells him he has a possible case, involving sheep, he is a bit sceptical, but isn't doing anything else, so goes to investigate.Not quite as mundane as he thought, with a bet, some Norse mythology, and a shapeshifter or two to be sorted out."
5,Neat!,"A great read. It's got a bit of everything for PBNers. Not exactly a collectors book, but a fun, well writen account. Probably the only book written on PBNs. And from the (Craft) master himself!"
2,Not priced right,"This mobile is adorable but $40 is really way too much to spend on it. I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck, infact my son loves to watch it go around and around. However, like the other reviewers say, you have to wind it up and it doesn't last long enough to even be worth it! It's ridiculous to spend so much money on something that just looks cute and isn't useful."
3,disappointed,After reading all the great reviews. I was expecting a challenging good hard workout. But after completing the first workout I didn't even break a sweat. So I decided to do the other workout too. It was better then the first. This a a good workout for beginners or if you want a light workout. Not for the intermediate or advance exerciser.
4,Good workout for days when you are tired,"I love Violet and I own a couple of her dvds. This is a fun and easy workout for days when you don't have that much anergy but still want to exercise. It is not really demanding, if you had been working out regularly for more than a month I doubt that you will find the separated sections challenging at all, however if you do both of them (it takes less than an hour) it feels like you a nice workout. It is definitely great for beginners as she really breaks things up and gives you periodic times to recover (which I truly believe are not necessary for the cardio sections are not that demanding). But as I said, when I don't have that much energy, this is the workout I turn to, you have to diversify."
2,disappointed,"1st, unrelated to content: my dvd stalls constantly (I should have exchanged it, but didn't get around to it).2nd, what I can see on the video wasn't challenging. I consider myself to be in moderately good shape - I can run 4-5 miles at an 8:30 pace consistently, play soccer, work out to Jillian & Jackie videos,etc... But my heart rate was not elevated anywhere near the ""cardio"" zone and I was bored. I think I'm used to more aggressive instructors. Her accent is cute though."
4,For Better or Worse--Just Keeps Getting Better...,"I don't buy Lynn Johnston's books expecting just a comic strip...just one woman's view of what love, life and family are all about! I have EVERY one of these books and I hope to continue to enjoy the ups and downs of the Patterson clan as long as Lynn keeps coming up with these wonderful, heartwarming books!"
4,Great..but did not like ending,"I really liked this book alot..it was hard to put down. I kept figuring out the mysteries, but knew at the end I would be proven wrong and would have a great surprise..well..all my guesses were right. I would have given this book 5 stars, but because of the ending, I gave it 4. It ended to fast and everything was wrapped up quickly with a nice little bow. With all the drama and suspense in the book, the ending was a disappointment."
2,"Very long, slow start.","I could have done without most of the first half of the book. Then, as another reviewer stated I would have liked more of the ending. It just didn't tie up the loose ends. I didn't figure out the ending ahead of time, but I don't try. This is not one of those books that you go to bed thinking about the characters or that stays with you after you have finished it. Mariana was one of my all time favorite books which is why I got this one. This was a horrible disappointment, but I am going to give the author another try."
5,"Loved, the ""Shadowy Horses!""","""The Shadowy Horses"" is the first book I have ever read by Susanna Kearsley. I have to say that it is not going to be the last. She writes like the style of Barbara Michaels and I have been want to read at least one of her books for a long time, now I know I will like the way she writes. This book is set in Scotland on an archaeological dig. The little boy, Robbie, has the second site, and it's haunting, especially to the main character, Miss Verity Grey. While Verity begins her job in Scotland she falls in love, but is still scared because it is with someone she shouldn't fall in love with. This book was absolutely great and is one of my favorites. Don't miss this great thriller!"
5,Another Fabulous Susanna Kearsley Novel,I fell in love with Susanna Kearsley novels when I read Winter Sea about a year ago. These days I can't wait for each new novel to appear. Shadowy Horses did not disappoint me. I finished it in two days.
4,The Shadowy Horses,"An historical novel with a twist. I really enjoy Susanna Kearsley's writing - the mix of historical fact,spirit world and romance."
2,Big let down!! :(,"I was sadly disappointed with the latest book from Susanna Kearsley. It was so slow - and rather boring! They ghost story dragged...the romantic story dragged....I did like the characters and thought they were somewhat interesting. But this book just was no where near as good as The Winter Sea or Marianna. It's almost as if, this was the one of the earlier books she wrote and just now got around to publishing it - surely this book couldn't have been written after her other more successful books??!! I am a huge fan of this author, but sorry to say this book was not good in my opinion. I kept putting it down and going back to it - did not devour it like I did some of her other ones."
3,Pretty good...,"This book was pretty good. I'm really interested in archaeology, so that aspect of it was fascinating, as was the ghost. I also really liked the characters and the feel/mood of this book. My only real complaint was that it never seemed to really get of the ground. There doesn't seem to be any real conflict for the majority of the book, then at the end it's sort of rushed and very, almost too, easily resolved. Other than that, though, it was really very good."
2,Had great potential but needed more substance,"I had moderate expectations beginning this book. I love Susanna Kearsly but I feel like this book doesn't do her talent justice. It is long, drawn out, and although it had potential I could not find myself caring about the characters."
5,Favorite Author,I started reading Susanna Kearsley about a year ago and now I wait for her new releases. Her writing style is vivid and easy to read. I love the fact that her books mix the past with the present and throw in a little but not too much romance. Shadowy Horses is a little different from her other books because the main character is not the one who sees the past. I have noticed that she tries to change up how her books slip back and forth through time and this one is no different. It stays much more in the present this time and only nods to the past.
2,Disappointig,"Yoda Stories comes with all the Star Wars (1st trilogy) universe. But controlling the charachter is difficult, expecially during combat, and missions are few but quite long, and you can save only between them. I've found this game very frustating."
2,I was expecting more,"The box advertized it as ""thrilling"" but I don't consider this lousy game even worth spending time with. The graphics are horrible and most of the time you can't tell what you're doing"
2,Fun while it lasted,"This toy was great fun for about a week, at which time Bozo inexplicably began a slow deflation towards the ultimate end. Not sure what happened."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the Bozo Bop bag for my 3 year old grandson; I thought it would be great fun as my kids had one when they were young. We blew it up and played with it for a few minutes and then opened other gifts. It immediately began losing air and by the next morning, Bozo was flat on the ground. I have a return form, but according to the directions, I need to pay postage to return it. Since it is pretty heavy, and the fact that I paid only $16 for it, I'm not going to return it. I emailed the company to express my disappointment in having to pay postage to return a defective item, but have heard nothing from them. If this item kept it's air - even for only a few weeks - I would've been satisfied. However, just a few minutes of play by a 3 year old doesn't cut it!"
2,Fun but doesn't last,"I bought this toy for my very active three-year-old. He loves it and plays with it frequently, often pretending it's one of the ""bad guys"" such as a Joker goon from Batman. Unfortunately, the first Bozo bag had a slow leak somewhere which was impossible to find, making the included patch useless. Then someone else got him the same Bozo bag for Christmas and this one seems to have lasted for now but I do have to fill 'er up every week or so just to keep it sturdy.It often doesn't bounce back, either on carpet or hardwood floors. The weight on the bottom seems to be a bit loose and itself moves when the Bozo is punched hard into a horizontal position. Overall, it's good for active kids but not very sturdy."
1,Very Unhappy,I was very disappointed with this toy. It would not inflate due to a leak in the value area. Either the quality control of the manufacturer is nonexistent or the product was defective. I returned it and indicated that I would like another one sent (my grandchildren loved it but were quickly disappointed when it wouldn't inflate). Todate none has arrived. I'm lost!! I don't know what to do except maybe not do business with Amazon since there is no one to talk to or contact.
2,fun but not durable,"I got this for my boys, 1 and 3 at the time, and they loved it, unfortunately it didn't last long. It got a leak within a day of having it. Since then we blow it up occasionally and they still really enjoy it. I may get just a plain bag with no ""appendages"", like hair, arms, or noses. Less seams to pop open, because that's where the holes tend to appear."
2,Not sufficiently bouncy,we had this toy for our children years ago and it seemed more resilient to punches. we remember bozo being a very active part of playtime. this bozo goes down and stays down pretty easily. his nose beeps but only when mashed on when he is down. our grandson is 17 months old and gives bozo a salutory punch and then a hug when he comes to our house but ignores him the rest of the time. possibly our grandson is just too young or lacks pugilistic fervor.
2,Deflated,"Bought this for my kids for xmas and blew it up at 11 pm, but 6 in the morning, it was deflated. Tried reairing several times and didn't hold the air. The kids were very disappointed."
2,BOZO BLEEDS,Not to happy with purchase...have to add air every couple hours as it slowly deflates...will not stand upright and sometimes will not pop back up....
4,Fun!,My 7 year old loves this - although I bought it for myself...it's not as tall as I would have hoped but it still works. We blew it right up with a little hand held pump and it's pretty durable and works well - nice and heavy on the bottom. And the best thing is the nose squeeks when you punch it - it's too cute!!!
4,what I expected,"Despite some reviews making me nervous about this product, I ordered it for my nephews. They love it and although sometimes it gets a little deflated, the boys are still elated to play with it."
2,NEEDS BETTER REBOUND,"I bought this for my son for Xmas. He's only 7 and he's small for his age, but when he hits this thing, it just lays on the floor and he (or someone else) has to knock if back up to him. He lost interest in about 5 minutes and hasn't played with it since. I was really disappointed because this product got good reviews. The quality of the plastic is fine, but I think they need to put more weight at the bottom."
5,A sensitive portrayal of the southwest.,"Since there are several synopsis already listed, I'll just say, Laura Baker gives a true feeling of the southwest, and I compare her favorably with Tony Hillerman. Her descriptions are eloquent and I look forward to reading more of her books. Having recently moved from New Mexico to the midwest, reading Legend made me homesick."
5,As The Ship Goes Sliding By,Free is where it's at on this show. Mike is Sick. Someone get that man a garbage can
5,Unexpectedly Great and Funny,"I was dragged to this film and LOVED IT! The film depicts college life in a completely realisic way, what floor lacked geeks and Pickles types? The parties were realistic and fun. Much as I tried to resist, I found myself laughing hysterically at the antics of our two heros......The movie is fun and amusing, a must have."
2,Good thing I waiting til it came out on video.,"Well, ""Dead Man On Campus"" wasn't one of the best dark comedies that are out there but it's ok to see at least once. If it hadn't been for the main wakko guy in there, can't even remember the characters name, I don't think I would have lasted through the whole movie. The whole idea of finding a roomie to kill themselves so the two main roomies could get easy A's was funny but other than that, that was about it. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for this paticular movie when I rented it but I seriously doubt it. You're gonna have to rent it yourself to come up with your own conclusions."
2,I really thought this movie was pretty bad.,"When I first saw this movie I thought it would be worth renting you know. Because I really like Zack, and the other guy is alright. It looked like a really funny movie, but after seeing it, it was more realistic than it should have been, it didn't have too many funny scenes. It just wasn't worth watching."
2,Knowledge about Islam,I think it's essential that sister Irshad Manji to view videos about misconception about Islam by Dr Zakir Naik.
1,Jumping on the band wagon,"I find this book absolutely repulsive. It is actually hate propaganda. Just imagine from the title. This lady was actually paid by the hate group [...]. Just the envy of other religion is the fact that islams book hasnt had 1 word changed in it since according to islamic text it was given to man. There are actually quranic verses from Muhammads time in major unversities around the western world verify that. Whereas in christianity and judaism you have to keep on digging for ""dead sea scrolls"" Quran has been promised to muslims to not have one word changed till the end of time and if there is a GOD there is 1 proof He has kept his promise so far. On the other hands all other major textsof other religions have been modified to fit the fashions of the current era which as history tells will not go on for ever."
1,glossy cover and words don't make scholarship,"I couldn't even give this a star, but had to since 0 stars is not an option. Manji is typical of the counterfeit type of scholarship so common in our age that tries to integrate observations in a slanted and maligning way. After productions such as this, I can understand how in ages before, educated classes were against allowing the written word to be learned by those who had no intellectual skills; To those who read this book, please do not be fooled. Ms. Manji is not at all considered learned in any branch of Islamic study, and the half-baked information and slanted conclusions she makes any fourth grader can make. This book is mostly a sophisticated and literate deployment of shallowness and disintelligence."
1,revenge personal diary,"The book was indeed funny and entertaining, but it's more of a rage of a woman who only looked at one piece of the puzzle instead of the whole picture. If Irshad's goal was to call for reform then she dialed the wrong number. Her style is not scholary by any means. I recommend the readers to read the following book ""Beyond veil and holy war"" by Ahmed Saleem. It gives a more accurate understanding of Islam and its image. It is a shame that Irshad wrote such a book about such a great religion that is such misunderstood in such a critical time!"
5,Book is a nice but usless attempt......,"How do you reason with people who kill, burn, and destroy over a few cartoons printed in a newspaper? How do you ""reform"" a religion that advocates hate, violence, and death to all ""unbelievers""? This book does not deal with the fundemental flaws of Islamic doctrine and culture. Now the Muslims hate Denmark because of the mohomed cartoons...who is next on thier ""hate list""? The Koran is a book of death and no feel good self help books like this will do anything to stop muslims killing and slaughtering people."
2,Confusing Islam and Muslim,"My title says it all. I do understand how she ended up having the particular view point of...whatever we might call her subject matter. I do concur on some of the issues she discusses (though for some only generlly). However, throughout the book, she should've been a little more careful in choosing or in the labeling of her subject matter.I would agree, again in general terms, that MUSLIMS need to reform, or rethink how they apply, adopt, etc. Islam. But reforming ISLAM does not make much sense.I can't emphasize this point enough. The confusion of the two terminologies blurrs all the arguments, both good and bad, and makes this book a non-worthwhile diary to read. Without the proper separation in Ms. Manji's mind, at least, of what this book is talking about and the proper labeling of it, this book would make no sense at all, except for the Islam-haters."
3,Shouting Against the Wind,"Manji's book offers a Muslim voice not often heard. While the book could sometimes benefit from more academic scholarship, Manji's quest is authentic and honest. ""The Trouble With Islam"" should not be read as a primer on the world's second largest religion but is a nice companion to introductions like those by Diana Eck, Bernard Lewis, Ahmed Akbar, or Charles Kimball.What is horrifying to me, however, is the flood of hateful responses from Muslims that can be found on this and other web sites all over the internet. The very ignorance and hate Manji writes of and against is being proven by her critics. I am appalled by the constant anti-semitic and violent words that are thrown her way. I've read that she's had bullet proof windows installed in her home. Ignorance is powerful.Consequently, I recommend Kimball's ""When Religion Becomes Evil."""
2,The Right Message Badly Delivered,"Although I believe most of what she writes is fundamentally correct, the delivery is poor. In general it was a bad mix of a casual coversational writing style, too many personal stories, cherry picked anecdotes and a lack of serious scholarship. It tries to stradle being both a personal memoir and an overall analysis of Islam but fails on both accounts. I would suggest reading ""Infidel"" instead - a similar message but simply a better book."
1,One more to add to the list!,"Here's one more anti-Islam book to add to the list. Short on research and long on rhetoric, it reads like a complaint letter about her dad and all the things she does not like!If you were thinking about reading this book to learn about Islam, DON'T! I recommend Jerald Dirks' Understanding Islam or John Esposito's What Everyone Should Know About Islam. Dirks is a graduate of Harvard Divinity School and an ordained minister who is a Muslim now. Esposito teaches at Georgetown University. You can also visit Islam101.com or whyislam.org for more info."
1,Inaccurate and sophmoric,"This book is only interesting insofar as it stands as a clear example of how opportunistic writers can bait stereotypes to sell books. The authors is clearly out of her depth in discussing history and theology, and has a tendency to present herself as the sole voice of dissent. Her suggestions about ijtihad and interpretation are old news. They have for long been debated by scholars of Islamic studies."
2,She Tried but not enough!,I personaly agree with must of thing that she's saying in the book but but it seems like she didn't have enough information (lack of source ) in this book.another good book in this subject : Shadow's of the 3rd century ( read this and then decide for your self)
1,What a bunch of B.S.,"All the greatest teachers were great because they could grasp high concepts and speak about them in plain everyday terms. Mr. Wilbur can do neither, and he has so many quotes, the book borders on plagarism. This book can only serve to hinder your ability to speak in English (see the other review)."
3,Hmmmm....,"Fudging things a bit, Brown released this set of ten old hits, re-recorded with a '50s rock gloss. Bubbly and good-natured, yet also a little over the top, and definitely not the '80s originals."
2,"Overrated, glorified TV-movie of the week","To be sure, the performances are all high-caliber (although Judi Dench was ROBBED of an Oscar). But really, who cares about this? I really hoped this would have been a deeper character study of the life of ""The Queen"", but instead all you get is a sliver as it relates to the death of Diana. I sat in a theater thinking, ""Is this IT?"". This is nothing but an A&E-type channel docudrama with higher production values. How it ascended to the level of ""respectability"" it has boggles the mind."
3,It's good to be Queen.,"The Queen starring Helen Mirren is a good film about Queen Elizabeth II but I was somewhat disappointed by the storytelling. Thank goodness for Mirren, her delicate performance saved this film from sinking, her Oscar was much deserved. Most of the film surrounds the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth wasn't a fan of hers by any means. I was expecting more of a dramatic film, the Brits really are stuffy. This a mixed bag for me."
3,This is really a pseudo-documentary,"Mostly about the ""Diana-demise"" era. While not intending to be a comedy, such is its best feature. ""Blair"" plays a British ""Howdy Doody"" with panache. ""Liz"" is largely boring and her occasional dry wit is SO dry that one needs hydrating before the unwarrantedly-abrupt (but welcome) ending. An Academy Award? Just what ""academy"" might that be?"
4,Helen Mirren.,What else do I need? She's very good at what she does and portrays the Queen as I perceive her to be. This movie covers the time of Princess Di's death and how the royal family reacted.
4,Good Perspective,Found this story very interesting. It's perspective of the Royal Family was believable as was the hidden emotions of the Queen that struggled to surface. Good movie.
2,The Queen,I guess I expected something else from this movie. I didn't enjoy it for one second. And how do we know what really happened in that palace anyway?
2,Interesting yet boring,"While the movie certainly has it's interesting points, the majority of the movie is slow and dragged out well beyond the ammount of content in the movie.While there are some interesting things in the movie it is scattered and they seemed to pull in random facts or points of interest in to the movie to fill the 2 hours."
5,"Mrs. Parker-Bowles ""THE QUEEN""","I was only an child in the 3rd grade when Princess Diana Died.. I later grew up to find out how much of an wonderful spirit and beautiful person she was.. In the news, I would hear how the tabloids and the royal family would speak about Diana. When I saw ""THE QUEEN"", it opened my eyes even more for me to realize how much the royal family would degrade her in such a disrespectful way but, it also shows the tenderness of HER MAJESTY has for the boys. This is a really good movie but also a short movie..."
3,Story falls flat at the end,Good acting but this is not a good story movie. There is no climax and resolution. The film just sort of......ends.
3,Interesting movie,"Interesting movie which depicted the story as anticipted. Sad, moving, seems like a factual account of the activities of the time."
4,Behind the scenes versus the public eye,"This movie did a good job of showing how the public eye sees reality and how that reality could be seen from the eyes of those in the public. This gives a dramatic review of how the events around the Death of Diana could have unfolded. The acting was done quite well and it was easy to move into this reality for a bit. You even felt compassion for the Royal family and for the difficult situation that the Prime Minister was in. In the end, it was a good movie for expanding the understanding of what happened from another perspective."
2,The Queen,"It was a good acting by Helen Mirren, but the flash back scenes of Diana's death was not justifiable for purchasing it in the high quality blu-ray format."
3,Unsatisfied,"Even though the bluray was described as used, description did not specify that the movie was missing it's original case, and instead it had a case from a video store. I would have NOT bought it if i had known that. Besides, the packaging was far from acceptable; they cut a yellow folder in half, and taped the bottom. Not very secure. I have pushased many used items before, but i had never received such a bad service. Im rating it 3 stars because the bluray itself was in great condition, and the shipping was really fast."
2,Boring - not what I expected,"Everyone seems to truly love this movie - I was bored to tears. Although it gave a nice overview of the events of the week of Diana's death and was very informative, I found the acting to be dreadfully boring and the direction was lacking. James Cromwell is one of my favorite actors and even his performance was abrupt and overall did not flow well. This movie could have been a million times better if it had a better director."
5,Helen Mirren is Superb,"My housekeeper asked me to buy the DVD as she knows I buy a lot of items from Amazon. Upon arrival I wanted to watch the ""Queen"" also. Frankly, I have never followed the tabloid trash regarding the ""royals"" and the only reason I bothered viewing the Queen was because of Ms. Mirren's reputation as a superb actress. I cannot speak honestly to the historical accuracy that was presented. However, Ms. Mirren took this role and the quality of her acting as well as the other characters in the story make this film most entertaining. Interestingly, not one word of profanity was used in the dialog and a 5 star movie was produced. Maybe other film makers could profit from my own observation."
4,Great vocals and songs,I was late getting this CD and was greatly impressed with Gregg's vocals and his songs here.There isn't a bad track and the horns used really push the songs.I hope we can see more of Gregg Allmans great singing on future releases soon.
3,LOW QUALITY SOUND & MIX,"I bought a copy of this in the uncut format off the internet awhile ago, called The Ducktape Mixes. It states on the notes that it was recorded in 1995 at Ducktape Studios in Decatur Alabama, and later sent to L. A. for production where it was butchered. And later released as Searching For Simplicity, after hearing the quality of the Ducktape Mixes it makes this sound horrible. So if ever find a copy grab it, this is the only copy I have ever seen."
4,Music that grows on you,"Nothing can top the last 2 CDs of O'Hearn's: Beautiful World & So Flows the Current. Hard to follow a dancing bear!""Slow Time"" the CD is just that, quite mellow, but it grows on you the more you listen to it. My favorite songs are 'Where We Once Stood,' and 'Slow Time.'"
2,Madden 2000 for Game Boy Color,"I thought this game was pretty bad. This is because I played soccer for the old Attari, which is at least 15 years old, and the graphics were just as good, only the gameplay was more realistic. this game is simple. One guy gets the ball, another guy runs into him, he falls down, end of play. Without lighting it's impissible to see anything. Also, Some things aren't realistic like 80 yard punts. Worst of all, there are no levels. I've played games and even with the worst rated teams, which by the way all of the teams are just as good, all of the games I creamed the other team by over 50 points. Madden for the N64 was very good, but for game boy it was bad."
5,Great gift for my 1 & 4 yr.old,"My 1yr. old & 4yr. old received the flip out sofas as Birthday gifts. They love them & so do I. My daughter loves to drink her milk while watching TV so this was great for her since she doesn't have to sit on the couch any longer. It eliminates alot of milk stains!!! She loves hiding behind it & under it & is actually pretty comfortable. It also works well if we have a sleep over. Another plus is the fact that the cover comes off so you can wash it. This is a great buy for the price, especially after seeing how much other sleep out sofas and/chairs cost. This works as both and I highly recommend it."
2,"Basically, a designer tarp.","I have a generic pool like an Intex. The cover that came with the original was form fit that was a soft ""cap"" that came down over the lip and tied with a strong nylon draw-string. After three years of use, (chemicals will destroy plastic over time,get a salt chlorinater), the cover fell apart.I ordered the Intex cover, for the name, and got a designer tarp that ties at four corners with thin (cheap) nylon string. It works, but I expected better from Intex."
1,STOP!!!!!,"This game is very easy and BORING!! I don't recommend this game for anyone!! Don't waist your money on this, you might as well just sell it at a yard-sale for all it's worth!! Save your money for a better game! Trust me it stinks horribly!!!(BOO HISS)"
1,boring,the title covers it. used this for a girls bible study and it was very repeatative. i would not recommend
5,Great Show,"I really like watching Mike Holmes. He is very knowledgeable when it comes to constuction. I like how he gets when he finds poorly done work. He make funny remarks, even though it is a serious matter. His work is outstanding at the end. I am going to get all of his seasons. Looking forward to the Hi-def widescreen seasons."
4,"Not bad, but not great, either...","I have several years experience on NT system administration, but I know lots of guys who don't pass the Microsoft exams by experience. So I did the prudent thing: I bought the Dummies book and also bought the O'Reilly ""MCSE: The Core Exams in a Nutshell"" book. The O-Reilly book is a no-nonsense book meant for experienced people and fills in the gaps left by the Dummies book. Between the two books and a rash of practice tests available for free online, I passed the test with a 866. Could have been better, but I'm glad to have passed. The CD that came with the book had terrible exam questions! Ignore the CD. But the book is good if you want to learn. What matters is if you have experience or not. If not, get the Dummies and the Sybex MCSE books. If you think you're experienced, follow my path. If you think you're a wizard, go take the test without studying and then come back humbled.... Buy the book, it will help you!"
5,Helped Me Pass The Test.,"This was a really great study guide for the Networking Essential exam. After buying the MS self-study guide for the course, I was left somewhat confused by their immense explanations of subjects that this book made seem so simple. To further aid the retaining of the material, there is a chart in the front of the book, which contains definitions, maximum distances for cables, brief explanation of the OSI model and other facts that are sure to be on test. If you only get 1 book to study for this exam, make sure it is this one."
2,Thrown together!,"This book seems to be thrown together in a hurry. In a sense, this book is written more for a person that is looking to get a certification instead of really understanding the material.The game which comes with the CD is worthless.I would stick to some of the more reputable guides. If the rest of the books in this series are anything like this one, I sure will not purchase any of them."
3,Only as a first read for a Novice...Net Ess 2+ books 2 pass,This will be good for a first Introductory read which will give you a span of whats coming...You need to get another In depth book and some practice exams. I dont think the Author's intention was to make this a comprehensive review of the subject matter...since it is really an extensive field. Typos and some BAD answers...watch out..the CD is trash! Good Luck
2,Not from Amazon.,"I love this CD, but somehow it disappeared from my itunes and I couldn't find it anywhere on my computer, plus when I purchased it from Amazon, it did not state anywhere it was the edited version, and if you know this CD, then you know that was very annoying, and the downloading for adding it to a device from Amazon is way to complicated, so mp3s is one of the things I will not be purchasing from Amazon, I'm staying with itunes."
1,Are you kidding?,"I have taught creative writing for more than 20 years at the university level and for all I know, Bishop has written a helpful book. But a writing text book that costs $77.00 is simply outrageous. I wouldn't buy this for my own use nor would I assign it to students."
1,Trial by Ice by Richard Parry,"Four stars for the research and the history, one star for the author's attempt to describe their environement. This is an interesting account of the Hall North Pole attempt. For me, the major problem is the flowery descriptions of the weather and landscape he throws in: ""The icy breath of the iceberg chilled their lungs.."" ""The only signs of light consisted of scattered ribbons of violet and purple fluttering briefly behind the sable mountains.""Come on, this is history. The descriptions the author has chosen to add to spice up the book were very hard for me to wade through. I almost gave up because of them, but instead, decided to skip-over and ignore the flowery descriptions and concentrate on what the crew went through and survived!"
2,Startrek Classic Phaser Review,"The phaser looks great but I would not recommend for smaller kids because it is not durable. The main problem i've found is the batteries. If you take them out you will have trouble getting the phaser to work after you put them back in. You may have to GENTLY adjust the prongs that touch the batteries or on the Communictor from ""Enterprise"" you may have to add a piece of cardboard between the battery cover and the batteries. All in all I was a little disappointed."
4,Star Trek Phaser,It's pretty cool to handle something that I watched them use on tv when I was young.
5,Sonic Calgon...,"Take me away. This is quite a relaxing and breathtakingwash of sound. Lay back and say ahhhhhhh.......These are not your standard Verse - Chorus - Verse structure.They are long, blissful, but not ambient.Think Kirsty Hawkshaw meets a surrealistic Portishead witha bit of Massive Attack poured in for good measure. No,these guys are not at all like Delerium to me, although I lovethe rotating canvas of artists that make up Delerium.The TB303 is put to unique usage on ""Both Oceans""... yeah, possiblya sample, but it doesn't matter the way it is used. Rather thanthe tweaked out squeals in the club, it's used as an ambient,hypnotic drone for a mellow journey. Other favorites of mine are""Flooded"" with it's atmospheric textures and drum n bass filteringin and out, and ""Warm Sun Fingers"" weaves it's delayed drums echoingout a dreamlike tapestry with Jane's vocals."
4,Natural Healing in No Time,"I got a nasty cut on my arm one week prior to knee surgery, and I was worried about the risk of infection. I remembered the Burt's Bee's Res-Q ointment I'd purchased recently, and began applying it several times a day to the cut and applying a Band-Aid. Five or six days later when it came time for my surgery, the cut was fully closed and healing well. I'm not sure the cut healed any faster than if I'd put a topical neosporin/bacitracin ointment on it, but it was reasaurring to know the Burt's Bees ointment was more natural and probably more gentle. My only complaint (and thus the 4 star rating) is the ointment tends to leave a green residue on clothing, so I find I have to wear a Band-Aid if I use it in a location (such as upper arm or knee) that will have clothing brushing up against it."
1,A big dissapointment,"To tell you the truth, Yoot Tower was a big disspointment to me. I loved SimTower to death, and I was excited for months that followed the release of Yoot Tower. I've build many many SimTowers, and just recently achieved the Tower rating in SimTower.The box for Yoot Tower excited me even more. I loved the idea of being able to build in different locations. But, what I could build was my problem.I don't have a lot of very picky reaons why I don't like this game (like how the regular elevators are limited to 15 floors...) but the problem is with the game as a whole. Ovbiously, when it went from Maxis to Sega, it changed a lot. It changed the entire SimTower theme that I really loved. And unfortuniently, that was for the worse."
4,An old standby that continues to work,"Most earbuds are junk in my opinion. The Jabra C100 is one of the exceptions to that rule. Although its not the last great earbud, its definitely a step above most. I get better clarity than most earbuds (on both ends of the conversation). These seem to last longer than most other earbuds I've tried. Most other brands seem to break within months if they ever worked at all. At least I can count on about a full year before this Jabra model starts to wear out. This is not the answer to my earbud prayers (I dont think that exists), but its the next best thing and most reliable alternative that I have found."
5,Great DVD,"Luther is one of the best series I have seen on TV in ages! Idris Elba is in his element, back in London, acting with a top, talented ensemble. The series was suspenseful and beautifully filmed. There isn't anything like it on TV. I am waiting with great anticipation for the next part of this series to be aired. You need to purchase this DVD so that you can join the fans who are counting down the time until the next series is aired. I bought it for a birthday gift for my son.I'm waiting for him to see it so I can borrow it. LOL!"
3,No women inventors?,"I bought this book because my daughter's fifth grade class was studying inventors. I was quite disappointed to find that there were no women inventors in this entire volume! There is a chapter on the serendipitous discovery of Teflon at DuPont (and Goretex), as well of nylon -- but not of Kevlar, developed at DuPont in 1965 by Stephanie Kwolek, nor of Scotchgard, discovered by Patsy Sherman and Samuel Smith at 3M in 1952. There is a long section on computers, but no mention of Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper who developed COBOL and apparently popularized the term ""debugging"" (even though there are sections titled ""The Entomology of Computer Bugs"" and ""The First Actual Bug""). I'm afraid I expected more from Ira Flatow, a respected science reporter for NPR."
5,Holocaust Industry gone berserk?,"I highly recommend reading the book ""The Holocaust Industry"". Its Jewish author N. Finkelstein deserves praise for his courage to write it and for his persistence to publish it.The book is devided into three chapters: 1) Capitalizing the Holocaust; 2) Hoaxers, Huxters, and History; 3) Double Shakedown.The book concludes with this statement: ""The Holocaust Industry has clearly gone berserk""--- There is little doubt that growing anti-Semitism has its roots in the excesses of the Holocaust Industry. ----An important book. - It shines the spotlight on a forbidden subject."
3,Controversial book,"Finkelstein is quite a convincing writer and offers a new and interesting point of view that isn't traditionally followed by other Jewish scholars. I found his points on reparations from Swiss banks and the dealing of reparations as quite revealing. Unfortunately the book is quite short, and at times can be a bit boring. Aside from that, the book was generally interesting. Recommended."
2,They deffinitely don't dissolve!,"These are sold as sublingual lozenges, however even after 15 minutes they don't dissolve. You can chew them, but they taste very bitter (like chewing on an aspirin). I have tried other sublingual vitamins before and they are nothing like this. They are meant to dissolve under your tongue. I will definitely be going back to my old brand."
5,gross point blank sound track,Lov it !! be better if i actually had it but Band of gypsies is still trying to get it here since aug 12 th:0
2,"blames and criticizes parents, not very helpful","This book present arguments for co-sleeping, breastfeeding, and homeschooling and against the use of punishments. I already agree with those ideas. However, I found the book had only limited and overly simplistic advice on how to implement those principles. It also contained a lot of alarming assertions about the permanant damage you will cause your children if you make any parenting mistakes. Maybe this book has more value for an academic or social worker. As a parent i found it unhelpful and full of negativity."
5,The perfect gift for parents with a child of any age.,"Jan Hunt's book is a collection of valuable clips that read quickly and say a lot. Each ""lesson"" leaves you wanting to read one more. She touches all the little questions around parenting, discipline, educating, and communicating, with ideas that show us how really important such issues are, and how much we may want to evaluate our choices.Reading this book early in your baby's life will help you to formulate your responses and be ready before issues come up. The Natural Child is just as important to have on hand with growing children, as most topics covered are ageless, and continue to reapply as the child goes through the schooling years.Dr. Linda Folden Palmer, Author of ""BABY MATTERS, WHAT YOUR DOCTOR MAY NOT TELL YOU ABOUT CARING FOR YOUR BABY"" (Lucky Press, 2001)"
5,Every parent should read this book,"As a new mother, this book was the most important I have read in a long time. Both my daughter and I have and will benefit so greatly from the wisdom of peaceful and respectful parenting. If you are a parent, new or with older kids, please read this book!"
4,Very good - get them from Costco,Very good sound. In the end buying them from Costco. Cost exactly the same without delivery and you have Costco's warrantee as well
2,Is this even the same set?,"Description doesn't match the product... pictures don't match the product. I actually like the look of the chips a little better than the ones pictured. The aluminum case has an aluminum frame with cheap plastic panels. I've seen way cheaper sets with better cases than this one. Also, the case has a nice deep scratch in the ""alum-plastic"" panel right out of the styrofoam packaging. I knew I was getting a deal with the price so low, so I expected it to be kind of a cheesy set. The chips are mediocre and about what I expected. I haven't played with them yet, but they appear to be usable. But it's a lot cheaper than expected... especially since it seems to have so many great reviews. That and the non-matching item to the pics leads me to wonder if they ran out of the set everyone is raving about, and sent me a cheaper set as a replacement."
2,Stickers peel off and cause chips to stick together,"The denomination stickers are a pain - they peel off too easily and often cause chips to stick together. Not sure what constitutes ""clay composite"", but nowhere near as nice or heavy as clay chips."
4,Delightful book with one minor flaw...,"This book is beautiful. The illustrations are gorgeous. I love the old-timey magical kingdom that is the setting and I love how each picture has so many round things, not mentioned by the text, for the reader to discover. However I was disappointed reading the book to find that a perfect rhyme scheme becomes very awkward in the last pages, ending the book on a sour note. If you can overlook the awkwardness, then you'll probably find the book thoroughly enjoyable."
1,P-Funk funkin sucks,"Well, let's see. I really wished that i could have rated this with a zero star rating. I could have trained a monkey to make this cd. ""I'm George Clinton, blah, blah, blah! I can use the word 'Funk' in new and interesting ways in each line of my songs, blah, blah, blah!"" Suck it P- funk. No, excuse me... ""Funk"" it"
3,Useful but short,"Thus far, it has been a useful companion, and it has the basics down fairly well. It covers all major subjects and their subsections, from engine to body. It has basic fault diagnostics, and service recommendations. I've yet to find false information or bad advice. Note however, there are illustrations that do not represent the whole range of cars this manual covers. They're correct for some, wrong for others.That being said, it is a little short, and is missing information on certain parts. I've been restoring and fixing classic cars for years, so I like to think I know what I'm doing (don't we all). What I need is more detailed information on this particular car, and less of the general information. This book provides a good balance of both, but along with its length, it does tend to fall a bit short on the details. That's when you turn to the factory issued shop manuals."
5,Very Underrated Clapton Album,"There's One in Every Crowd is an essential Clapton album. Clapton was in his prime in the 70's, cutting albums like Slowhand and 461 Ocean Blvd. This album often gets overlooked. As usual on a Clapton album, all the songs are great. Buy it."
2,THE SMOKING ANNOYED ME,This film would have been much better if we didn't have to endure a chain smoker in the leading role.One could almost smell the stench of the cigarettes as the leading character is continually lighting cigarettes -in fact eleven during the course of the film. Whatever possessed the makers of this film to allow this in this day and age.I was nausiated everytime a cigarette was lit. Completely ruined the film for me.
1,Boring.,"I really wanted to watch this film, it sounded good but it was horrible. The whole movie is just stupid, bad acting and just plain boring."
2,Pass,"I love a low budget experiment as much as the next gay, but I thought Judas Kiss was a disaster. The acting is horrible, the characters and plot quite cliched, and, well, it just sucks."
1,Blu-ray disc is a BD-R (copy),"The Blu-ray of Judas Kiss is a BD-R copy.I got it directly from amazon.com and not from the marketplace.I don't know if the distributor decided to make copies on demandor if I have a illegal copy. Amazon has been notified of this.As for a review of the movie itself well lets just say that itbored me to tears. Why can't Independant American Filmmakers ofgay movies make them more like the Europeans and other regionsof the world with good stories, scripts and actors that can actually act?"
5,wonderful cd...Watch out for Levellers and Manics!,Serach lights is my favorite Levellers song. The raindrops version of the Manics is the first recording they did after Richey disappeared. The whole album is great. Trust me you will listen to it for years!
4,Captures the Essence of the Valley,"I loved this movie not for the plot or the familiar landmarks, but for nailing the essence of the valley - a place where people from all walks of life come together, all of them strange. The scene in the park where the failed movie producer runs into an old colleague happens all the time. The SFV tried to secede from LA not too long ago, but in fact it left the planet long before that. It's a place of has-beens and never-was's, of second chances and not quite getting there. For example, in the movie, the big score was $30,000 plus life insurance, not the millions in jewels people normally kill for. The only cop who tries to do it by the book is later kicked off the force for being deranged. I happen to like it here, I guess that says something about me, and I think the movie captures the campy quirkiness of the place perfectly, right down to the air conditioner breaking on the hottest day of the year."
4,"Exciting, weird, fun","Not a great movie, but not a bad one, either. A rather convoluted plot, but followable. The characters were well done. If you are into catfights, the fight between Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron is good, too. These are two really lovely women. One shot of Charlize nude, too. A fun movie for a guy, and women would not find it too upsetting."
4,48 hours killing game...,"When I watched this film, I thought that this film is similar to Quentin Tarantino¡s ¡Pulp Fiction¡. The plot of this film is similar, because of the director of the film. The director, John Herzfeld usually made TV series. This film is the second work for him as a full-length film. It has a style of TV drama, there are no main characters and at last the cases, which link each other, are solved like a TV drama. In this film, twelve characters meet each other through the different routes, but finally it connects with one case. The interesting point is the characters of this film. They are related to one another quite complicatedly. However, they all are involved in one homicide accident. It is funny and interesting."
2,Convoluted and haphazard,"Too many characters, not enough depth in any of them, and not enough time spent bringing them together in a believable manner.This movie was too dumb to be realistic, and too convoluted to be classified as mindless entertainment.When it ends, you're asking ""Is that it??"""
1,pulp fiction wanna be,sorry this movie just does not do it for me the only decent part is when james spader (i think thats him i couldedn't tell with the glasses)goes around taking people out
4,An awesome movie--- James Spader was GREAT,"""2 days in the Valley"" really made an ensemble cast work! The characters were great and we could follow each one of them really well. Besides the really unique, gripping, twistedly funny and smart plot, James Spader gave an awesome performance from the beginning to the end."
2,Don't buy this version!!!,"This is a good movie, however this version with the sun glasses on the cover that was released by HBO is NOT IN WIDESCREEN. It's just a letterbox 4.3 (640x480). Once you ""zoom it in"" to fit your screen the picture is of poor quality. I had to learn the hard way. Buy the other version that was released by Paramount in 2007, or you'll regret it.:("
5,Queen of Folk,"This is an excellent compilation of Odetta's best stuff. The collection covers her years with Tradition Records to Vanguard Records. This will satisfy both the soulful, gospel fan, as well as as some folk legends such as Bob Dylan."
1,How Awful Can it Get?,"I got this game and rued it ever since. after seeing the graphics I first thought it was made before total annihilatoin (original), but later found out it was newer. The tech tree is dumb, and its hard to tell what the units are, i mean it's quite bad when you can't tell a difference between a horse and a rat."
4,GREAT CATCHY MUSIC,"THE MY SWEET ANGEL SONG REALLY GETS YOUR HEART! GREAT MUSIC FROM A BAND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE. IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY WITH A TWANG OF GOOD OLE SOUTHERN ROCK, YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD."
3,One great track; others so-so,"I heard the song, ""Winter,"" on the Eklektikos radio program on KUT, the public-radio station here in Austin. It's a really great song; that's why I bought the album. The other songs on the album or okay, I guess."
5,SWIM CAP PERFECT SOLUTION,These white caps with strap are hard to find but perfect for recreational swimming. This is my third purchase. I'll be back for more as they are worm out from use and enjoyment.
4,Really big.,Very well made but I should have purchased a medium. Large size is very large. I wish they had a head size chart to select the proper size before ordering.
5,Eclectic Classic from Cake,"""Fashion Nugget"" is one of the most eclectic and diverse albums of this decade. It smoothly ranges from Doris Day (Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps) to Willie Nelson (Sad Songs and Waltzes) to even some glimpses of rap (The Distance). Greg Brown, with his single-note solos and guitar lines, adds a punk influence to the whole record, while John McCrea's deadpan delivery only increases the cynicism of the lyrics. Plus, the songs are all tuneful, have good hooks, and some of the best bass lines ever offered on record."
5,"Cake: Fashion Nugget, GREAT BUY","This cd has it all, rythm cool guitar and drum solos and even an occasional extremely moving lyric or twobuy it"
5,These group is the absolut best in the world!,"The first time i heard them play I thougt i would die! Their music really makes you feel good! ""I will survive"" is one of their best songs, but it does not beat ""Italian Leather Sofa""l."
4,Grows on You,"I think everyone liked The Distance, but the rest of the tracks grow on you the more you listen. ""Frank Sinatra"" was featured on The Sopranos back in the day, it's a good one."
1,"perhaps it's Abba, it's Abba, it's Abba..","The song ""Perhaps"", which sounds like a collage of songs is actually half (gasp) Abba's Fernando! I'm wondering what other 70's treasures are hidding in this Cake.."
5,Adorable!,"Cute, sturdy, and fabulous! Washes up nicely in case of an accident, trust me! Holds tons of diapers securely, complements the decor wonderfully!"
1,Content of the item,"This is the notorious 21-page obituary notice published in The American Journal of Science, where Asa Gray tried to destroy the reputation of the naturalist C. S. Rafinesque."
5,Excellent watch - Good value!,"Great watch - great price! Looks snazzy - a little ""jazzy"" and dressy at the same time. Arrived in perfect condition and made a wonderful gift."
2,Promise not met,"I gotta say I was disappointed. Haley of Part One was an interesting character; I was hoping to discover more of her in Part Two. Instead, the story goes in another direction entirely. Now that I've finished the book (and at the risk of giving away the plot too badly), it started going downhill after the grandmother was written out. Moreover, some loose ends are leftover at the conclusion (for example: in Part One, Miss Powell's personal life seems to be loaded with innuendo; in Part Two, she's just sort of ""there"" as a secondary character).The last 25% of the book seemed predictable. I went from ""She seems kinda neat"" at the end of Part One to ""Who cares!"" at the end of Part Two."
1,The adventures of a totally fictional girl,"I had thought this was going to be a funny book about a girl growing up, but it is actually a weird story of what a man thinks it would be like to be a girl growing up. The plot is completely unbelieveable, even by magical standards. The use of profanity, which is supposed to show how Haley is a tomboy, is outdated and badly timed. The sex scene could have only been written by a man, because a 17 year old girl would have never found that first experience anything but miserable. I was really sorry the book wasn't better as it started out with promise."
1,HP No.45 Black Ink Cartridge Twin Pack 51645A,I do not recommend this product. The ink was practically dry and useless. The package didn't protect the cartridge from drying. I had to change my printer because of expensive cartridges.
1,Have only heard half the cd,"Right now I only heard about half the cd and i probably won't hear the other half cause i just threw this garbage out the window on I-85. J-kwon...hmmm as the Great Guru once said REAL mcs are a minority, and u r not one. Not only are you frontin like crazy, u are a huge rip off. I can remeber back ahh maybe 2 and half years ago there was a little song called Grindin, I have no more to say."
4,hood hop,i was pretty satisfied that i got this album. since i liked his single of tipsy and hood hop which is very good.
3,lets get Typsy with some good beats,At first I thought that J-Kwon was a member of Da Hol 9 a local group who had a huge hit about some club in East St.Louis well then I heard Tipsy it was a massive hit on the 2 rap stations(100.3 the beat and Q95.5)here in the STL but personally Im not a fan of him.His video was okay and if you did not here someone got shot at his second video wich he shot just short of the Arch.He tries extremely hard to rap but ultimately fails but the beats on this album are cool.Its a half and Half attempt.Lyrics 4/10 Production 8/10 X Factor 6/10 Classic 5/10 Me 7/10Overall=30/50 This album gets enough for 3 stars
1,This CD is aight theres only two songs i like on it actually,This Cd aight like i said befo but its nuttin new he sounds worse then P-Didy's dumb ass. He also sounds like a dyin cat in some of his songs so i gave it a 1 star.
3,Not the best but not crap,"Ok I see two types of reviews here. The people who love and praise this guy and the one who hate him. I'm in the middle he has a few hot tracks like You and Me,Tipsy,and Hood Hop but its just not consistant. For a 17 year old there is alot of talent and I'm sure he'll continue to improve. Also to you who think Kanye West isn't as good as him no offense but compared to Kanye almost all the hip hop out there is garbage if you want true hip hop go pick up a copy of Kanye West The College Dropout."
2,garbage,bottom line dis nicca iz sum strate KUT! only reason i even gave dis cd a 2 iz cuz of tha beatz. If tha beats wuznt hot den dis cd wuldnt even been put out. cuz gurlz wuldnt lyke em cuz dat nicca ugly so its a wrap 4 hiz a**. he needa jus put tha mic down nd walk away nd thank jd 4 givin hiz 15 min of fame.
1,NO NOT BUY THIS CD!!! DON'T SUPPORT COPY PROTECTION!,"OK... I liked the Song TIPSY... I wanted to put it on one of my Party Mixes (F&*K NO!) THis dumb ass CD has copy right protection (scrables it when you try to put it on a mix CD). OK so I thought let me give the rest of the album a try. THIS CD SUCKS, where are ZERO STARS (kid is 17 and the album sounds it) and Its a CRIME that ARISTA used copy right protection on such a S**T album (Its hilarious that USHERS actually great album didn't have it). THANKS D**KHEADS now my MIX is F'd. OH by the way I have a utility that Bypasses the copyright protection. Its called ""Easy CDDA Extractor"" you can get it from www.afterdawn.com for FREE(thanks for saving my mix). DO NOT SUPPORT ALBUMS THAT HAVE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. I Buy albums to support the artist but when I can't make a Mix with the CD i paid 14 bucks for that's F'd up!"
1,OH no...,"When I first saw the video for 'Tipsy' I actually thought the album would be quality. He had da man Daz Dillinger in the video and was on the So So Def label. I thought Daz would get some production in, but I was mistaken. The trackboyz produce the entire album and by track 5 you are already tired of their style. But that's not the worst. JKwon completely sucks as a rapper. He has next to no skills. His flow isn't that great and his voice is extremely annoying. The album only has 3 good songs; Hood Hop, Tipsy, My Enemies are the only good songs. JD hasn't found the next it with this guy. He's definitely a one hit wonder. 1 star."
1,This CD is a piece of s&*%,I've listened to the whole CD and I'm glad I burned a copy of this from somebody. This CD only have maybe 2 songs that are good. Tipsy and Hood Hop. Thats it.
4,It's Cool,i might have to give this 3.5 or 4 stars.the best songs on there is:-Tipsy-Hood Hop-ICIC-Show Your A$$-Welcome To Tha Hood-My Enemies-Parking Lot-They Ask MeSo Overall it's a pretty solid CD I'd recommend it
4,It's not Ocean Rain but it's a good album,"First of all, Ocean Rain is a great album and this is not the same. It is not as dark and moody. It is mellow pop.That said, one of my favorites is Just A Touch Away, which was haunting (and yes, mellow.) It had the same romantic touch to the lyrics, though not as edgy. Forgiven was a beautiful live song and the album version is still a great listen.The bottom line is this -- if you want Echo and the Bunnymen in their witty, edgy and yet romantic Ocean Rain era, this album is not going to deliver it to you. But on its own, I think the album stands up."
1,Montavius from Richview Middle School,"My book report was about this girl named Alison who hated her mother and had a gay dad and a okay stepdad . She also had a sister who had a friend who had an idea that could make things a disaster . Her horrible idea was if they signed up for the school play maybe they could end up with dates for the freshman dance,but things had been a disaster for her since her big sister Alison had left .Susan thought that doing this would make her look cool or as kids say ""popular"",and that is exactly what Susan wanted to be . Susan thinks that everything she tries to do leads to a big problem ."
4,Amazingly comprehensive guide to model rocket design,"If you want to design and build your own model rockets, whether for sport, research, or competition, you can't go wrong with this book.It has chapter after densely-packed chapter on every facet of model rocket design and construction, including basics of stability, materials, finishing, cluster and glider design, repair and recovery systems.Weak points: This isn't a book for beginners or the faint of heart. It won't lead you by the hand through your first rocket design. The reading level is on the high side . . . probably best for High School students on up."
2,BLAST OFF!!,"I bought this book, hoping that I could learn how to build a massive rocket (possibly capable of carrying a human or human-sized cargo). Actually, I knew a bit about rocket building anyway, as my brother is quite keen on it.Anyway, I was disappointed when my first 'creation' didn't really work, especially as I had burned myself quite badly during its construction.Since then, I feel I have improved somewhat, though I am still a long way from building the kind of rockets I would like.Overall, this book is adequate for the hobbyist, but for the dedicated amateur rocket scientist, it simply doesn't provide enough room for adaption."
3,Different tunes and melodies,"This cd is ok, many of the songs have very different sounds to them than I am used to. The cathedral singers do a very nice job, but if you are looking for classic Marian hymns that you grew up with, this might not be for you. Although the last song, Ave Maria, is very beautiful."
3,Something made to make money.,Low bugdet and the actors wasn't that good. The camera would be off at times and the story line was not good.
1,"Worked for a while, then it didn't - replaced it",This item stopped working after 5 months. Had to order another one to replace it. Paid more for the replacement. This inexpensive one is costing me more over the long run. Lesson learned.
1,"Failure, but satisfaction","I order a computer conversion cable (printer to USB). Unfortunately, after complete testing, it did not work. However, the company made the deal right. That is a lot more than I can say about many other firms. I will return!"
1,Did not work on either of two PCs,"Tried using this cable to connect HP LaserJet 5MP to an HP Pavilion laptop and an HP notebook, both running Windows XP. Neither computer recognized the device."
2,Worked about half the time,"Not sure if it's the software driver or the cable design, but we constantly had to ""reset"" it by replugging in the USB (regardless of the port). We ended up buying a USB laser printer and gifting our old printer to someone who still had a system with a parallel port."
2,not a great conditioner,This conditioner smells great but I felt like it left my hair dry and very difficult to comb through.
1,Horrible,"If I could, I'd give this absolutely no stars. Horrible. Absolutely horrible. I have very long color treated hair. This is literally THE only shampoo/conditioner line that has EVER made my hair feel like STRAW. Never purchasing this again. Thankfully I bought the trial sized bottles before wasting my money on the full sized ones."
2,Not a conditioner that I expected,"I usually think a conditioner should make your hair soft and bouncy . This product made my hair rough and dull . Although , the smell is awesome . Next time , I would just buy the shampoo and use a different conditioner."
4,"Thick, Creamy, and Oh So Dreamy~......to a point","This stuff smells great, it's divine, really. The conditioner works well with my hair, I can match it up with almost any shampoo and have shiny, smooth hair. Great results! I don't always use it with the matching shampoo because the shampoo is much too harsh for my hair, but it still works well with the Coconut Milk shampoo. I docked a star because although this conditioner has a great, thick consistency, it's impossibly hard to get out of the bottle!! I've tried shaking it upside down, beating the bottom of it upside down, letting it sit upside down...I can only do so much. Right now I can manage to get some out one-handed in the shower, but I fear that it'll take both hands and Thor's almighty strength to get any of the conditioner out later on. It's a shame, it has a great feel, but it's much too thick..lovely conditioner, though."
2,TOO THICK!!,"I didn't like Organix Coconut Conditioner because it was so thick that I couldn't squeeze it out of the lid. So I took off the lid, and still had a hard time getting the stuff out. I banged the opening on my hand and bathtub trying to get some out, and the conditioner wouldn't budge!!! The only way for me to get some out was to squeeze the bottle with both hands hard. It was too much trouble, and took too much strength to use this product, so I threw it away. The shampoo was good, and not great. The coconut smell was o.k.; I've smelled better coconut fragrances."
1,Useless,One of the worst conditioners I've ever used. Left my hair dry and tangled. Dried out my scalp to the point that it was red and flaky. Don't bother with this product.
4,good,"It is a good one and good price.. the reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is not fabulous, it is just good.I tried different kinds of these Keratin products.. this one is not the best ever but it is good, it is the best you can get with this price. I also like its coconut scent, it is really nice"
3,Needs More Moisturizing,"This conditioner smells good, a bit heavier on the blossom than the cherry part of cherry blossom, but it lacked the kind of moisturizing I look for in a conditioner. I had to use quite a bit just to cover my hair (which falls just below my shoulders) and when I rinsed it out my hair felt like wet straw. It was a bit better once my hair had dried, but it still lacked moisture. I've had better luck with other conditioners, and I'll stick to those."
1,Dont buy. ever.,"This has to be one of the worse things I have ever purchased. I thought since it was organic it would be better for my hair. but all it did was strip it of all its oils and make it feel like straw. My hair felt softer after using shampoo than it did after the conditioner. This Product is so bad I wouldn't even give it to someone else. I'd rather just throw it away. Dont buy. and if you do decide to buy it... then just remember, i told you so (:how this product is getting anything more than one star is beyond me though. I despise this product. They have to be paying people to write good reviews or something. idk."
2,Nothing Special,"I bought this for what it promised. While it wasn't terrible, it was not spectacular. I have thick, dry unamangeable hair that I flat iron daily. I felt this conditioner was too light and not nurishing enough. It does smell great but the scent does not last. Still looking for that amazing life-changing product!"
1,You get what you pay for,I really wanted to find a coconut scented shampoo so I decided to try this one. It was a fairly inexpensie shampoo and I can see why. While it certainly smells like coconut it left my hair feeling very dry and flat and I have pretty easy hair to manage.
1,Beware!,"First the pros. Big bottle, smells good, very thick. Now the cons. For a product called Organix, I expected organic contents. Not so much. My hair fell out after using this conditioner. The product contains ""cones"" (dimethicone I think) which I am allergic to. The ""cones"" leave your hair shiny, but smother your hair if used regularly. It does leave my hair (what's left of it) very soft when wet. There is no moisture when dry. All in all I'd give this conditioner a negative star if it wasn't for the pros. By the way I am an african american woman wearing her natural hair 4a/4b."
3,Fun outfit,"As short as it looks in the picture... Fits those with smaller chest sizes... the top has very small cups but will look fine when you wear it out, the skirt is very short. Fairly thin material"
3,got it for my grandma,Grandma wanted a book on diabetes so this was the purchase. she said it seems old and the pages were yellowed. We thought this was a newer book.
3,weird,"I bought this book because I saw the title of it in the feature film ""The Matrix."" The book is very weird, but absolutely spellbinding and thought-provoking. If you've got time on your hands, get the book."
3,This is a tough read,"As other reviews have mentioned this is a very tough read. I became interested in this book after learning that it was one of the books that inspired the Wachowski brothers when developing the Matrix movies. After trying to make my way through portions of it I can see how it ties into the Matrix universe, but frankly the terminology is very technical. I've read a fair bit of philosophy at both the undergraduate and graduate level, so I have some basic understanding, but I still struggled. I made three attempts, but ultimately I gave up, as the effort involved in reading the book was more than my interest in it would warrant at the time. I may try again in the future.Note: My three star rating is based on my ability to get something out of this and not an assessment based on any academic understanding of the material."
5,A Classy Groove,"I have only listened to the first 6 songs - including the fine No Problem from this outstanding TDR offering and I want to state that R. Ahmadi's critique on this album is probably borne out of a musical tunnel vision. The album GROOVES with great traditional Funk and I thought the vocals are quite talented, actually."
5,Rocks,"This dvd is great and worth every penny! My aunt and I saw HIM live and it her now second favorite concert and she's seen Iron Maiden, Metallica, and other metal's greatest bands."
5,One of the best,"I'm a big fan of HIM and everything on this dvd is great. Their are two interviews and it goes from love songs to and love said no. It has videos and live clips on every album. The only thing I did't like that much was the Bam Margera Heartache every moment clip. Don't get me wrong I'm one of Bams biggest fans, but I don't want to see clips of his girlfriend having sex with another girl. GRoss!!! The only untasteful thing about it. Buy it if you love HIM its worth it!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Looks really nice but its really cheap plastic, and it broke within a couple weeks of my husband using it. Cheap junk."
3,Average,"I genearlly don't like things that are ""average.""I bought the unit for its design, and to match the small Toshiba TV/VCR that sits on top of it.The complaints I have are as follows:1) It turns itself off unexpectedly, this seems to happen usually when the TV is off. What this means is that if you want to listen to music CDs with this unit, you have to turn on the TV first.2) It responds slowly to input from the remote and the buttons on the unit.On the positive side:1) It has all the buttons you need to play DVDs, and to access special features, menus, etc without using the remote. The is an advantage over many other DVD players which require the use of the remote even for basic DVD operation.2) The remote is well designed and fairly compact.Overall: I got what I paid for."
1,Small......Small....Small!,Please please....only buy this if you have cups/bottles 16oz or smaller...because that's the only size cups/bottles that can fit. A can of soda can fit easy in there but if you got a Powerade bottle or something of that size..it won't work out too well.
3,Now a review from someone other than a Hidden Beach employee,"It's ok, but nothing fantastic. I waited for a year for this album, but frankly, the City High CD I bought at the same time as this one is much better. I love Hootie, and I love Darius' voice, but the main problem is the same one that plagues the Blowfish albums: the songwriting is just not all that great. I notice he gets a LOT of help in the songwriting department (none of the songs are written soley by Rucker), yet it doesn't seem to help. I've played the album over a dozen times, and there are still several songs that I couldn't hum to you if my life depended on it. Maybe he should have recorded more Al Green songs. In short, he shouldn't quit his day job."
5,LAUGHS AND SHIVERS ABOUND,"Philip Pullman has a string of popular stories to his credit and well knows of what he writes. This time out he offers middle readers just what he knows they'll enjoy - frights (rattling chains, howling hounds, and thundering hooves of invisible horses abound) plus liberal doses of laughter.A creepy tale of a greedy count and his evil scheme is presented. The question is: what will prevail good or evil?On All Soul's Eve two innocents are pursued by the Demon Huntsman. Will they escape?"
5,"Awesome book, buy an awesome author","This book is awesome! I love the twists and turns. Then the ending is excellently crafted. I also love the characters, like Herr WoodenKopt and Sinelwurst! This book is funny, scary, dark, and awesome~"
1,Don't Bother!,"Spending your money on swamp land in Florida is a better way to gain information about our environment than purchasing this CD.If you are in desperate need of the information found on this CD, I'd go with the out of date WRI's 1994 Information Please Environmental Almanac, look up the pertinant information and double check the source to update the figures.The problems with the CD are as follows:1) There is no program on the CD, in other words the information is held within the CD as unorganized text files. Just click and read and read and read and read and read-and what was I looking for in the first place? It's easier to find the proverbial needle.2) It's not Macintosh friendly Don't spend the money if you are planning on viewing this CD on a MAC.Sincerely,"
2,Not good,"Too many Galic , Scottish terms used and not explained. The story dragged with no reason to. Maybe the rest of the series is better!"
1,Huh?,"I suppose I should of kept reading it. But I couldn't get past all the old time/Irish/Scot/whateverdiscription of everyday things. The title should of given me a clue....Quine?!?Also, the story was...to me..disjointed.Anyway not for me...I want to understand the Language used or at least 90%....Sorry."
4,Great Album - some serious stuff,"First off, I've bought ALL of Tonis other albums. This one took me three listenings to really get to like it. When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind. If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT. And I'm not a female by the way.Nice ALbum. If you like Tonis other works,.....GET IT."
5,Great quality for a low price,Buying these bubble envelopes are costly in stores especially if you're buying them one by one. Buying this variety pack is definitely worth it and will save you money in the long run. The only downside with these envelopes are no lines to write the addresses. But I can deal with that and it doesn't really bother me.
3,Weak but nice,"The flag is poorly made but looks very nice. The ringlets on the side were falling off before I even opened the package but I don't intend to fly it outside so it isn't a big deal. If you're just hanging it up inside like I did, this flag is the best deal."
4,An Excellent Game,"The only faults that I could find with this game are those directly related to the Game Boy platform itself. There is a limited number of wrestlers involved, omitting some of my personal favorites. There is also a lack of a tag team mission mode, which would have been welcome. My biggest problem with the game, however, is the total lack of realism involved. All of the wrestlers behave the same. For instance, there is no way that the 200 pound X-Pac could powerslam the 500 pound Big Show. Another problem is that there are no real ""Title defenses"", so winning a title is meaningless. Even with these flaws, the game is still a very good one for the Game Boy"
1,Poor,"What the heck is this? First let me say that I have King of the Ring and Raw is War for gameboy. I had more fun playing them two games than Wrestlemania. First off, the gameplay is a mess. It was a mission to even punch my opponite at times. Secondly, I know this is only gameboy, but what is up with those graphics? Wrestlers aren't supposed to look like mush. The titontron is decent but you can only view it in Championship mode. And you only see the guy your fighting entrance and not yours. I took the game back within 10 hours of when I bought it. Wait for a better game for your gameboy."
2,no sparks on this weak soundtrack,"it's missing ""sparks"" by coldplay... in one of the most emotionally pivotal parts in the movie, this song is played for a good 3 minutes... and that is very long as far as songs in movies go. not only that but ""sparks"" is probably better then any of the songs on the actual soundtrack."
2,ballpoint pen,not comfortable at all to use did not like this pen. Thought I would get use to using it after a bit but no.
5,Works perfectly,This item comes with all the parts needed and if you have a Joe Blow pump less than a 5 minute install.Highly recommend.
1,AVOID THIS SELLER!,"Ordered weeks ago and order was canceled today as it was suppose to be shipped. How do they not know what their inventory is, cancel an order after weeks and then continue to have this item on the website as available! Check out their history as a seller in general-AVOID at all costs. Could have ordered from another vendor and had weeks ago. Too many places to spend your dollars to tie them up with these folks."
3,Short mystery stories,"This book is okay, though not really my cup of tea - I'm not a huge fan of mysteries. However, if you are a lover of cats and mysteries, you may find the book quite good. It's a collection of 100 short stories by many different authors, all mysteries of one sort or another, and all involving cats who either save the day, or are the villian. It's ideal when you have little time to read because each story can be finished in only minutes."
5,Very Helpful!,"I started studying this form of Ki shortly before I found this book. Having the book clarified what I was doing in class. Better, it allows me to practice on my own and helps, as the title suggests, with the application of Ki principles to everyday life--since in everyday life aikido throws can't usually be used to deal with problems. For example, how to maintain energized relaxation in difficult situations, how to sleep better, etc. I recommend it highly."
5,So Cute!!!,I used this toy on my sister in law's diaper cake! It looked PERFECT and my niece loves it! Thank you so much!
4,alright cd made by the mobb,"okso its not as good as their old stuff but hey you can say that about any rapper i dont care who it is, but its a good cd go pick it up"
3,MD,"Signed newly by Jive, Mobb Deep comes back strong as usual. First single off the bat was ""Got It Twisted"" and it brought the ""realness"" back to hip-hop. The 16 track CD has the most craziest beats and not too many guest appearances, thankfully that include Nate Dogg, Lil John, Twista, and Jadakiss. Good album overall, BUT the second single and video though is too clubbish which is NOT there style hopefully should include a better selective for the third single. Definetely worth the buy~"
4,really 4/5 stars,"yooo any one who says this cd sux is just stupid. THis cd is blazin every song on here is just fire. theres no skip songs. whit production from kanye, lil jon, alchemist, its just on fire. go and cop it this ish is not no waste o\f money go get it.Top 5 songsThrow your hands(in the air)real Ni**asreal gangstasgot it twistedwin or lose"
3,Average Offering,"This latest from Mobb Deep isnt awful, but it isnt really great either. The beats are great, (reminds me of the beats of hip-hop of the nineties)it's what hardcore beats are supposed to sound like. Where the CD loses out is the flow on the beats are just winding down. I just dont think they have it anymore. Now here are the standout tracks, Amerikaz Nightmare, Win or Lose, Neva Change, and Got it Twisted (Dont listen to the remix, Twista's wack, his style is just not for me, that fast jack rabbit way of spitting is not a style.) I've enjoyed previous offerings by Mobb Deep, but this one is not their best, thatz it.I'm Out!"
2,"Reference: OK, Study Guide: Not even","I rate this book as being average as a reference, and poor as a certification study guide. It's a good starting point for those who have very little knowledge of routing protocols. It's extremely lacking on depths, scenarios and configuration examples to even be considered as an exam study guide or as job-aid reference point.The only reason why I bought, and spent time reading it, is its coverage on IS-IS and MPLS, which is not easy to come by."
3,The gauge was inaccurate.,Generally I love Topeak Joe Blow pumps. This one does a good job inflating the tire but the gauge read about half the actual pressure and that wasn't good enough for the type of riding I do.
1,Hard to inflate above 60 lbs pressure,I used this pump for 2 years and hated it. It was very hard to inflate my tires above 60 lbs with it. I had to use my entire body weight to get the handle to go down sometimes.I replaced it with a Serfas pump a year ago.
1,Returned it day I got it!,"Disappointing! I couldn't get it to clamp onto the valve stem, and after 20 min of frustration and having all the air released from the tire, I sent it back! It's a shame, I've heard they're good, but I surely couldn't get mine to work, and there's no way I'm going to deal with it everytime I need air!"
4,Gets the job done,"We bought this pump previously, but my husband accidentally dropped it and in trying to catch it pulled the top off. It's a good basic pump, so I ordered the same one."
4,THE AFTERLIFE,"THE AFTERLIFEThe Afterlife is about a kid that gets killed at a night club when he is with his girl friend. After he died, he walks around as a ghost.He can't talk to people or pick any thing up but he can go through walls and other things. When he dies he rises up from his body and thinks about why he got killed. He does all of the things he ever wanted but he never was allowed to do like make fun of cops or ride in a cop car and not even be in trouble.This book is really fun to read. It's fun to read because it is funny and very exciting. I would recommend this book to people if they like adventurous stories."
4,Good Performer,"I was suprised when I brought these speakers home, they sound crisp and clean. However, sometimes bass is exaggerated and there is no adjustment for it, but it is real easy to fix with Windows Media Player's mixer. Would recomend them to everyone, you cant find a cheaper 4.1 surround out there."
1,These speakers are not worth the asking price!!!,"I purchased these speakers today and hooked them up. I clicked on my iTunes, and then Van Halen's ""Hot For Teacher"". The sound quality was crap! All of the treble came from the satellite speakers while all of the bass came out of the woofer. Cymbals sound like one long sssssssssssssssssssssssssss. David Lee Roth had no bass in his voice.Next I tested the speakers with a little Placebo. It was aweful!!! These speakers are going back to ""place of purchase""."
1,Where are the vocals?!?!,Let's make this clear. The reviews that say that the vocals are a little buried are making a grand understatement. I can't believe this was released like this! I wanna hear Oderus!! You can barely hear him in the mix at all! VERY DISAPPOINTING!
5,Rugged and useful!,I use this product every day. When I'm done with it I slide the plastic clip to close for flat storage.
3,Liked the first book much better,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in the series. This one was ok but it will be the last one I probably read. I felt the author changed the style of writing in this second book, maybe to appeal more to teens. I also noticed that the covers of the books have gone to rather titillating illustrations of Jacky Faber in ""Halloween' type pirate wench garb."
5,Bloody Jack Adventures,"It was amazing! The perfect blend of comedy, adventure, suspense, and romance. Jacky is a lovable but imperfect main character full of charm and bubbly humor. The book is easy to read and is interesting throughout the entire book. I encourage everyone to read this entire series."
3,A Helpful Book,This book was very much helpful when I was preparing for my I-Net+ Exam.Hope that it wiil help others too.
4,"Good, even for the newer exam IK0-002","Good exam prep for a pretty easy exam. Even tho its a bit outdated, it does the trick."
5,"Works fine, then forget it","I was selling some computer equipment. Had a Dell computer and an ergonomic keyboard with PS/2 plugs--one for the keyboard, the other for the finger pad. Bought this little adapter and sold my ensemble as a complete set. Dell, I believe, was the first computer company to go all USB, although I'm not sure. But I ordered two more of these."
1,Don't waste your money,"Many reviews said this did not work, and they were right. Since it was so cheap I thought I would give it a shot anyway. Well, it did work with my keyboard, but not with my mouse. I know my mouse is not the problem because it works with another manufacturer's adapter."
4,Interesting Reading,"I'll never look at ancient Egyptian buildings the same. It's pretty great thinking that these are the answers behind the mysteries. I only wish that the book also took you step by step to make the different symbols. I skipped the first book and jumped right into this one, so maybe it was it that one. Overall, a fascinating way to look at things if your of an open mind."
1,Not accurate!,Drunvalo states he is a walk-in. Please. He would not need teachers in the 3rd dimension. If he is from the 13th dimension then he would have direct access to ANY and ALL information. I believe he is misleading people. The information in the book is ALL hearsay. I suggest looking at the melchizedekmethod.com. Better bet.
5,Rock on!!!,"25 years of Cinderella Rock and Roll and this is the lead ""album"". Night Songs, Push, Push and Shake Me are rock classics. I have Shake Me as the ringtone on my phone. Rock On!!!"
3,good for kids,"we got this because my son wanted a camera for his 10th birthday. rather than deal with film and the hassle of developing we bought this. our only complaints are that it is difficult to view the pictures on the tv or on the computer, there is no real manual on how to do it. other than that, the pictures are fine the flash is large enough and it's already been dropped off the roof and into the pool and still works fine. tough construction. a good beginning camera for children."
5,"Relevant to children not to mention, entertaining!","When all the characters in the imaginary world of Winnie the Pooh go on their day to day mischiefs, forgetting a friends special day, it makes one see how cartoon characters really portray real life situations. The full page of colors allows one to sit back and get the satisfaction of a children's book. Yet this book not only addresses a child's awareness nor is it an entertainment instrument but as well as a joyful piece of literature for any age group to admire"
2,Good sound quality but couldn't stand the buzz,"These speakers truly have phenomenal sound quality for the price you pay. However, I could not get them to stop buzzing and picking up static. No matter where I put them or how low the volume on the speakers was, I always seemed to get very loud static, and often the speakers would pick up fuzzy radio signals. Eventually I couldn't stand it any more and I just gave up and bought a more expensive set of speakers. No more buzz."
2,cheap speakers,"These speakers sound good for the price. However, they aren't worth it. Invest in better quality speakers. Here's why:1. mine broke. the left speaker no longer works unless I jiggle the cord for five minutes - granted i've had these for two years, but the cords are not detachable, so there is little hope of fixing this problem. I suspect I could have spent twice as much to get better speakers that would have lasted four years instead of two.2. interference. from the first day I got these they made horrid crackling noises (while not in use). using a cell phone near them sends them into paroxysms. just terrible. i often have to turn them off to stop the noise.If these speakers didn't sound so good for the price they would be one star. As it is I wish I had spent more two years ago. Save yourself the trouble."
1,Ridiculous,"I just bought this item, and it is broken!!!!I was so mad and really disappointed.I didn't do anyting wrong.Can anyone help me?The sub is working, both of the speakers are not workingIt is brand new."
4,Great for the money,"Great for the money, bought the CA-3000 speakers for $15 Canadian. I hook them up to a portable DVD player & they greatly improve the sound. No problems with humming or buzzing unless they are hooked up in the input jack instead of the headphone jack. If in the wrong jack, then the one speaker will just buzz.Only concern from reading the papers inside is that it says these speakers are not magnetically shielded. Aren't you supposed to keep magnets away from electronic equipment?? Even the el-cheapo CA-2012's ($9) say they are magnetically shielded."
3,Can't Decide,"I'm in the middle on these speakers. I like them, but at the same time, I wished I had bought some which are a little better. The sound is good or can be good if you have equilizer with your sound card. The bass is there, and so is the treble. Distortion takes over, as another review said, when you go outside the sane listening volume. I think most of us like a little heavy volume every now and then.If you like low levels of sound, then these speakers are for you. If you like to turn up the volume just a tad more, then go with a better set. And, oh yeah, don't be fooled by the size of the picture. The speakers are rather small. Sort of reminds me of that minature radio in the shape of a PC."
5,Dynamite comes in small packages,"I was kinda upset when they arrived in the mail, because of the size. When I got them hooked up and turned them on man I was impressed. These speakers are a great deal."
5,Perfect for engineering,"Considering its price, it has a lot of features that more expensive calculators have. It has everything I needed, linear algebra, symbolics, graphs. The only con that I have found so far is that is not so easy to use it, you basically have to read part of the manual before you get it started, but once you have read it and know how to use it, it is a pretty good deal."
1,Piece of junk,"Purchased this product for programming capabilities However, despite the fact that it came with an usb link, the software only search for COM3. If you have only a laptop this is useless. Tried to find an updated version of the software, but it still only will search com3 even though it says it's for usb port. Best thing for you to do is buy a TI calculator and save yourself the headache of even dealing with worthless engineering."
2,Dont Buy,"VERE complicated to use, if you just want a graphing calc for your math class save yourself time and monay and buy a used TI!"
4,oldies,"I am so glad that I found old music for my father, so he can listen to his music. He was surprised that we can get it on cd."
4,A Nice Tool,"I got this video product after I had been given a practical intro to drums by a friend. While I already knew much of what was on this video, I did appreciate watching it. There were some fine tips to getting a good start on the drums that my friend had not mentioned to me.I think this product helps you lay a good foundation for drumming. You could have absolutely no knowledge of music, and this will get you started."
4,"Colorful, Simple, and Easy To Read","This book is a must for people who are new to a Mac or new to an iBook. Even experienced users can quickly thumb through and find out quickly how to do something. Each page is in full vibrant color, with step-by-step instructions on how to perform different tasks on your iBook. It even shows you the instuctions in pictures. The pictures show exactly where to type or click! It features these instuctions on everything from installing memory, to writing an email message, to installing your airport card, and copy and pasting etc. It even features more advanced tasks like connecting to a network and performing a clean install of the OS.I recommend this book to anyone who is starting out in Macs and needs an easy way to learn all the common tasks in owning a mac. Just a warning, this book is not really for Mac experts or anyone who already knows Mac OS really well."
1,Celtic crossroads,No he recibido el libro aún. Yo necesito una respuesta: el número de envío y la empresa de correo. Muchas gracias.
3,a nice book to begin with,"presents some interesting techniques to evaluate companies (his 12 criteria) but simplifies these criteria too much. for someone looking to develop his/her own stock-picking philosophy, this is a nice book to begin with.the author mentions many other books which the reader can refer to for more detailed discussions.the last 100 pages (1/3 of the book) are basically useless.maybe best to make this a library book."
1,product came damaged,"I had this chair for about six months, the product came slightly damaged with cheap plastic parts. After about six months of use the bottom portion fell apart."
4,"a good collection of 12"" versions","I appreciate some of the previous reviewers' comments. I never owned the vinyl edition of this collection, and I had no idea that ""With Your Love"" was longer. As to the omission of ""Bad Girls"" after ""Hot Stuff"" -- well, that does seem stupid. As is pointed out, ""No More Tears"" is available in its long version elsewhere and would be a more logical deletion since the segue from ""Hot Stuff"" to ""Bad Girls"" is classic, not to mention that both sides were, obviously back to back on the same side of the 12"" single.As to some of these other songs being easily found on used cd's, I'm not sure what that means. I know of no other cd's that contain the longer versions of ""I Feel Love"", ""Walk Away"", or ""Dim All The Lights"", and I have nearly every Donna Summer cd released as well as hundreds of various artists compilations of disco songs."
4,classic donna summer,good stuff. this is great background party music for a bunch of old schoolers. cant go wrong with these classics.
1,Not even worth one star,"Are you kidding me? Who wrote these 5-star reviews? I'm guessing the answer to my question is: ""her friends."" This book has lines like: ""Tom was upset, and I was upset. We had a great time."" How anyone could sit down and read this entire book is beyond me. Reading about this self-absorbed woman and her husband were almost more than I could take - ugh! Will her next book be about their messy divorce? Please publishers, spare me the details. I do not want to be punished again. Save your money for real writers."
3,Just Ok,"Not Salsa-ee enough, too much 70's funk, but not good funk. Stick with Hector Lavoe's greatest hits or the El Cantante soundtrack."
5,Awesome stories,"I love this book! It's a book of math story problems. Raymond Weeks put the story in story problems. Who cares about math, the stories of wonderful. These stories don't have pristeen simple answers (neither does ""life""). Weeks provides a really nice view of simpler nostalgic times."
1,Should be recalled - HO3 Error Message,"Months after I purchased the player I recieved the dreaded HO3 error code. I fixed it per Panasonics specifications but got it again after the next play. However, even with the directions I have it won't work at all now. Upon researching this error code; I found that this error is so common - this model should have been recalled - save your money!"
1,One good song,"There is only one song on the CD that I really like, but I am still glad I purchased it. Deadman are good, but not particularly my type of music."
1,Why So Cheap,"I purchased this cartridge thinking that I was going to save some money. At first it worked great and I felt that I had found a good source for my toner at an exceptional price. Needless to say that less than 100 copies of usage I started to get black lines on my copies. After removing the cartridge I noticed a build up of toner on the photo drum. No amount of adjustment, light/dark, made a difference. Lesson learned, ""a penny wise and pound foolish."""
1,Cartridge does NOT fit Canon PC3,"Contrary to product description, the cartridge which we received will not work in our Canon PC3 copier.Waste of time and money."
3,Little Kids Game,"For the younger kids, this is a great game. It reminds me of the ""Hide and Go Seek"" game Barney had for Sega Genesis. This definately a game for the little ones that really can't play other games becaise they are too gorey or too hard. It has cute graphics, too!"
1,Cochinada de Juego,"Este juego es una cochinada mejor ni lo compren, yo creo que es el juego más malo que he visto, no tiene objetivo, todo nada que ver, uno no gana nada. Es como un juego de mesa todo purete. Unos gráficos malísimos.En conclusión es un asco de juego."
1,Doesn't live up to your expectations,"First, the positive aspects: The controller is easy to hold, the buttons work, the games look similar to the originals, there are 25 games included.Ok, now the negatives: Speed is too fast compared to the original (Intellivision games had a flow that this system seems to ignore), sounds are missing or different (some games play silent), some games it's hard to control the character (in basketball, I couldn't move diagonally).I appreciate attempting to create a Intellivison portable, but this attempt falls short. The Atari and Activision portables play much better than this."
4,It's great entertainment for a kid!,It may not fit the specifications to the original Intellivision but it's a great system for a kid. I don't think it is marketed to be compared to the original. The whole 'several games in one controller' is a great idea and it will probably be a matter of time before there is one 'good enough' aimed to satisfy a time warped adult.
2,"Great comforter, ok sheets and pillow cases","I ordered this 5 piece full comforter set for my son. He loves it. The comforter seems to be of good quality. However, the sheets seem to have a very low thread count. I think they should have atleast been 250 thread count. The seets and pillow cases are so thin, you can see through them."
5,The next big thing? Maybe,"I heard this CD playing in a record store and had to have it. My prediction: this album will be re-released in a year or two with a couple of English language tracks on it, and it will cross over to a wide pop/rock audience. (Don't get accordian fright - on this record the instrument is not obtrusive. Venegas plays piano as much or more, and that coupled with her songwriting makes me think she'll appeal to the pretty sizeable Fiona Apple audience.) If there's any justice, Venegas will get some attention from U.S. mainstream listeners."
2,bad disc,I KNOW this is a great movie - I've seen it and wanted it for myself.....this disc wouldn't play in any of my blue ray players.....very bummed.
1,Umm...wow,"I'm not sure what movie these other people were watching but THIS movie was neither inspirational nor uplifting. It was rambling, grotesquely sentimental and aggressively painful to watch.Thirty minutes into it, I felt sick that I was actually laughing at times during the telling of such a tragic, true story. Unfortunately, the film is just that horrible. The heavy-handed melodrama, constant sappy ballads, hammy overacting (except for Andie McDowell who was actually pretty good) and an endless flood of overwrought sobbing and breast-beating just made it unwatchable. It was as if the director felt he needed to constantly pound the viewer over the head with the suffering of the family and he was going to use every syrupy cliche in the book to do it with. Subtlety really is an art.Bad, bad movie."
3,Alice still Rocks!!!,"This is a good CD definitely worth buying if you are new to the world of Alice. However, I am not a big fan of best of/greatest hits album if you are like me and already have all of his studio albums anyway. There is some live tracks on this album which is pretty cool plus a cover of the Jimi Hendrix tune Fire but not much you haven't heard before making this a good album but I'd spend my money buying other Alice first."
1,Bad Book,"Boring, monotonous narrator contributes nothing to this snooze-fest of a book.Good points: Formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors. The read aloud function works great!"
3,Good Story but I hate the Ole English,"Great literature reveals itself in a great story, which this is. My problem was wading through the Old English to reveal the story. It really makes you think what if I were marooned on an island by myself. I really got to like his character, because he was so strong and resourceful, but what especially appealed to me was his self-searching and introspection. I know that sounds stupid what else could he do. Well he could of let the isolation eat away at him, until he did make contact then to find he could no longer have the ablity to interact with people. Another annoyance was (viz), yes the editor could of left those out for all I cared. Because of the Old English I would avoid young people reading this even though it sounds (and is) good."
2,LIfe in the slow lane,"If imitation is the highest form of praise, then this book must be one of the most praised books in the English canon. A man from a middle-class upbringing leaves it and ends up stuck on a tropical island. This story would inspire Swiss Family Robinson, Castaway, and probably Lord of the Flies. Mr. Crusoe is a white, Englishman with a wife and kids. After the wife dies, he leaves the kids to go on his own and to serve God. He ends up stuck on an island by himself. There he encounters cannibalistic natives, and one of their intended victims. The former scares him, and he essentially enslaves the latter, teaching him to call him Master.The book is not that interesting, as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common."
4,Classic Defoe,Remains readable for good reason. Finding God in a hopeless situation is a bonus. I highly recommend this book for anyone still interested in the classics.
2,not very good,i didn't like the book because of the vocab and the style. It is in old English and not very easy to read.
2,WARNING: This is NOT the original text,"Defoe helped to define the modern fictional novel when he wrote about the tales of Robinson Crusoe. The book has a strong religious theme, as was Defoe's intention. However, this version of the text censors out some of the language against what Defoe called the Papist Church (or the Roman Catholic Church) as well as some items which would be considered racially insensitive today (but leaving in much of it as well). I don't understand why this version leaves out some of those parts, as they completely change the story that Defoe intended. I'm not sure that Amazon knows these texts are censored (not the original) as there is no allusion to it in the book's description.The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1808)"
3,Classic adventure story,"I loved Swiss Family Robinson and Mysterious Island, so I thought I would give this a try. I enjoyed reading the story, but I found it drags somewhat. I appreciated the spiritual development experienced by Crusoe as he lived alone, but, for me, castaway stories with more than one main character are just more exciting."
2,Thyromine-Does Not Work,"I read several reviews and figured it would be a miracle wonder if I gave it the three months to work. I am on my fourth bottle, I even took a double dose for a month.I do not look yellow and some of the swelling has gone from my face I will finish the product but I will not order anymore."
5,Informative and Entertaining,"This title is one of the few that I have been able to find that actually helps the Alzheimer's patient, as well as the caretaker. My husband is in early-moderate stage and has found many incidents in the book that he can relate to. He keeps the book at his chair and re-reads parts of it everyday....and underlines frequently. I have found it very informative, and the author writes entertainingly as well. If you know some one that has been diagnosed with ""dementia problems of the Alzheimer's kind"" this would be a wonderful addition to their personal library, and to yours. I am thinking of buying additional copies for each of our children."
1,Pure Poo.,"I'm only giving this one star because ""Selling Jesus"" is a great tune. However, the rest of the album is unoriginal, boring, and actually hurts to listen."
1,Waste of money.,Even experienced PC builders couldn't get this to work.I had to go with ASUS instead.
4,Brilliant Concept - less than perfect execution,"This wonderful full-orchestra rendition of Durufle's requiem is one of the finest examples of his lush and complex sound. With the brilliance of Dukas and the panache of Ravel, Durufle takes full advantage of the orchestral range to breathe magical life into the requiem. Unfortunately, though, the choir is not always equal to this admittedly fiendishly difficult score. That said, I don't wish to discourage anyone from acquiring this wonderful recording. It has quickly become one of my favorite Requiems - right up there with Robert Shaw's almost-perfect recording of the Brahms ""A German Requiem."" A must-have."
2,DEFECTIVE UNIT,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW FOR THEIR BIRTHDAY. THEY PLUGGED IT IN AND IT WORKED FINE BUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO PLACE THE BATTERIES IN THEY DID NOT STAY IN. THE SPRINGS ARE MISSING TO HOLD THE BATTERIES. I HAVE REQUESTED A RETURN AUTHORIZATION AND WILL REPLACE IT. I WILL AGAIN RESPOND WHEN I SEE HOW THE RETURN GOES.
1,Why did I try Proctor-Silex again??,"After me first coffeemaker began leaking- and it was a realtively new proctor-silex 12 cup maker- I decided to try one of these ""cute"" single serve ones. Why, oh why did I purchase this brand?? First, it does take around 3-4 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee or tea. This seems like a longer time than most. And now, after 2 or 3 frustrating weeks, it's leaking just like the old one did. Not user error, as the water comes from underneath the coffeemaker. Also, the coffee is not coming out as hot either, which causes me to wonder if it's the heating element... Even though this one can use loose grounds or pods, it is not worth the frustration! Try a different brand. My sister-in-law has really enjoyed her Sensao!"
3,Facinating story of the history of the city of Magnitogorsk,"Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism as A Civilization is a fascinating history of the Soviet (now Russian) city of Magnitogorsk. Despite the comments of other reviewers (and the sub-title), the book mostly concerns itself with the building and earliest history of the city and not at all with the glorification of Stalin or Stalinism. The book simply details what life was like in what was supposed to be the protypical Soviet city under Stalin. The depth of research Kotkin has attained is just amazing and his writing is simply superb."
1,serious incompatibilities,"If you own a Toshiba notebook, DO NOT buy this product. It will crash every time you try to use it. I phoned the C-PEN support line and there is an incompatibility with the Toshiba drivers and C-PEN seems to be in no hurry to solve the problem."
1,Hope the 600C is better than the 600,"The CPen 600 is a piece of junk, and I hope that the 600C is better. The 600 makes many errors when scanning. And, while it's easy to edit the errors once you've beamed it over to your PC, it's incredibly time consuming. Before buying it online, I would test one out at a store (if I had the opportunity to do it over again)... scan something - see if it scans it accurately."
4,we need the equivalent computer for a boy,"My 2 year old granddaughter has fun with this as does my 3 year old grandson. Not to be sexist, but it would be nice to have one for him that deals with construction and cars and things that he likes."
4,"terrifing, don't play alone in the dark",this game will have you on the edge of your seat. there is nothing like being scared and feeling as if you are the one inside the game. great. loved it!
2,It's not Resident Evil that's for sure!,"I read all the reviews and it is a cheap take off of Resident Evil. I did like the settings however in the fog and snow and using the flashlight, I think that added to the suspense but resident evil 2 and the nememsis does scare the hell out of you at times where silent hill never did. Once you play resident evil its hard to surpass that quality in graphics and gameplay."
4,"Not a RE killer, but still very good","This game is the first true threat to Capcom and it's RE series. The atmosphere has to be the best part of Silent Hill. It's just phenomenal. It plays like a Stephen King book. And it stays with you even after you turn it off. All I can say is,this could make a terrific movie. The puzzles in the game start off mind numbingly stupid, but get tough, real tough, as the game goes on. I finished the game without a walkthrough, but I had to think. Neanderthals need not apply. The story really draws you in, and it's neat that your charecter isn't some gun toting commando who never misses. On the other hand, this game never made me jump out of my chair, or gasp, like RE, and that is somewhat disappointing. The also just lacks that something that RE seems to have. You don't know what it is but it just feels like somethings missing. Still, it's an excellent game, and though i still prefer RE to it, this game runs a very close second."
5,How Scary can a game get?,There is a diffrence between fear and surprise.Resident Evil{My favorite gaming seris}surprised you.This game put me on the brinkof [wetting] my pants.The sound is the scariest thing of thegame.Espically the air raid siren.Everything about this game isgood.{It has 5 Endings!}I reccomend this game once Amazon gets somecopies.
3,This is an incredibly scary game.,"Konami dove into the world or survival horror with this offering, stepping on the toes of Capcom who pioneered the genre with the Resident Evil series.Konami clearly tried to push the envelope in terms of providing a terrifying experience, and in that, they've succeeded. While it's certainly eerie to be chased by zombies, Konami took it to a new level with incredibly dark settings and sounds.Unfortunately, Konami didn't quite have the gameplay quite right. The controls were a bit awkward, and the main character just didn't move as smoothly as I would have liked. The graphics were only so-so, and the lack of snappy FMV was a big minus. Another problem was that the plot was a bit anemic -- overall, the game just could have used a lot more work.Nonetheless, it's a fair offering, because the sheer terror value of the game in many ways surpasses the RE series. If Konami works on the controls, improves animation, and adds more eye candy, they could have a hit series."
4,very good,"Silent Hill doesn't jump out at you from all sides, or leave you in boredom. Instead, Silent Hill is a slow leaning curve into gaming hell.Harry Mason is off on vacation with his daughter, Cheryl. Everything is going smoothly, and his destination, Silent Hill, is drawing closer, when a someone walks in front of Mason's car. Turning frantically, his car is thrown into a ditch. When he awakes Cheryl is gone. His search for her will lead him through Silent Hill's diserted streets into a hellish world, where the town's secret is found.Silent Hill is a good, disturbing game who's puzzles may be the best part of it. They aren't all the search and find type. Most of Silent Hill's puzzle actually take brains *gasp* to figure out.With a good replay value, Silent Hill is a definate buy for the sirvival horror game fan."
2,the ending sucks!,i think this game itself was ok but i have to say that i was very dissapointed about the ending though. i hated it! it...
1,What is this?,"I wish that I could ask Konami, ""Why did you waste so much time to make a game that is not scary at all?"" The graphics in this game don't even look scary and make the game look terrible. I think that Konami was just trying to beat Capcom's magnificent Resident Evil series, but did a terrible job of it."
4,Concise overview of Plato,"This concise overview is an easy introduction to Plato, highlighting his Theory of Forms and political ideals. The mini-book does it in the context of the times, explaining Greek history along the way. While many claim, ""All of philosophy is a footnote to Plato"", the book does justice to post-Greek philosophy, highlighting where Plato's logic lead him wrong.The book isn't in depth, but it never was intended to be. It's a great 1-2 hour read for those (like this reader) who want an introduction to the great thinker."
1,Utter Dissapointment,"This is total false advertising. The dvd contains a lot of information about the 49ers 1988 season, but almost nothing about the actual Super Bowl. The Bengals are barely even acknowledged, while only a few minutes of the game are actually shown. It hardly mentions anything that happends before the final drive.This should have included informatin about both teams and shown the entire Super Bowl from start to finish. Instead it makes it seem like Super Bowl XXIII only had one team and the game only lasted a few minutes. What a joke."
3,RAI Video Quality,"Please keep in mind that back in the 1950s, most television broadcasts were live to black-and-white TVs only. A common method to get live TV to 16 or 35 millimeter optical film was to point a camera toward a TV screen and film the over-the-air broadcast. Frame rates of television and motion picture cameras do not match. A kinescope would be needed to better match the frame rates. This video, however, looks like an amateur videographer somehow recorded the live TV broadcast to tape, but had only one-hour-length tapes on hand, so we lose part of Liu's aria during the tape swap. Keep in mind also that European PAL and American NTSC video formats differ. So, it is indeed unfortunate that a better source of this television production doesn't exist on the market, but I'm happy to have the videotape anyway. In my opinion, Franco Corelli is the definitive Calaf."
4,Young Justice Season Two,"Once again intelligent writing, great pacing, slick and polished animation. The production team of Young Justice deserves kudos. Except for maybe the Avengers, they are far and away the best animated series product to come down the pike since maybe the Avatar series."
2,The Abridged version is confusing,"I bought this book as an audio book, abridged.It was confusing. Stick to the unabridged."
2,Thirteen Moons,"I also loved Cold Mountain, one of my favorite books, and could hardly wait to read Charles Frazier's new novel. However, I was very disappointed. Yes, he writes beautifully, but I agree with other reviewers that the story was dull and uninteresting. I wasn't convinced that Will truly loved Claire, because their relationship was so shallow. I'm sorry I can't recommend that anyone spend time reading this book."
1,Sickening Sweet,"I agree with every word from the Washington Post review above.There was something sickening about this book. It was as though the author, previously praised for his writing, blatantly attempted to top it, but instead went too far over the top. Narrative description is filled with sickening sweet similes and metaphors, like a cup of coffee with ten spoons of sugar. With every line, instead of telling the story, we have to traverse all these similes, images, and metaphors. There can be too much of this. It slows the pace to a slither. Few books turn me off enough to the point that I'd say I'd never re-read it, but this is one of them. Not to mention a plot that made watching that paint dry a real joy. It bored me to sleep.If anyone doubts what publisher marketing can do, look at this one. There are thousands of books light-years better than this that never get recognition due to marketing and exposure. I think I've had my fill of this author for one lifetime."
3,"It's no ""Cold Mountain"" nor is it close.","I enjoyed Cold Mountain immensely and have re-read it several times. Sadly, Thirteen Moons is not in the same caliber at all. A pleasant read, but nothing to write home about. I finished it out of habit and am giving it to the library this afternoon.I will try again on Mr. Frazier's next book, as he obviously has fine writing in him, but can't recommend this one."
3,Not sure Frazier can match his first,"Some authors are destined to write a single classic. Harper Lee and her ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a perfect example. Having read ""Thirteen Moons"" (and generally enjoyed it), I regret to say the same might be said for Mr. Frazier.""Thirteen Moons"" is a nice book, but unlike his classic I wasn't drawn in from the first moment, and as I have discovered over this many years of reading, if I need to page back a bit to recall the story between reading sessions, the general impact of the book is lost.A friend commented that ""Cold Mountain"" was a disappointment for being a series of improbable events happening to an unremarkable person. I do not agree, but had that assessment been made about ""Thirteen Moons"" it would have been far more difficult for me to take issue."
3,An Historical Snapshot,"If you loved Cold Mountain, you'll probably be somewhat disappointed in the book - a unanimous opinion of my book club members. Although the book is, at times, painfully slow, it is a snapshot of this interesting phase of our country's history. Like many novels based on history, it puts a human face on ""facts"" and is worth reading from that perspective, alone."
2,Expected Much Better,"Since Cold Mountain is one of my favorite books in recent memory, I was expecting the same long, descriptive and provacative passages in Thirteen Moons. I was sadly disappointed to the point I almost didn't finish the book. It did not hold my interest. The story jumped around a lot and I thought the character development was weak. I did not get the feeling of time and place when reading this novel. Maybe it's not fair to compare his sophomore effort with Cold Mountain, but it seemed like some one other than Frazier wrote Thirteen Moons."
2,Yawn,I absolutely loved Cold Mountain and found it hard to put down. I found it difficult to pick this book up. Charles Frazier is so vivid in his descriptions you truly feel as if you are standing beside the main character. The only problem is the book doesn't take me anywhere. It just seems to drone on and on and I found myself getting bored reading it. Sorry but for me this book lacks the excitement of his first novel.
4,Keep them coming!,"Mr, Frazier's second novel is as good as Cold Mountain. I look forward to his third.He paints such vivid pictures of places and people."
2,"I loved Cold Mountain, but this book was a crashing bore","Every negative thing you've heard about this book is true - unfortunately. While Cold Mountain easily ranks among my Top 10 Favorite novels, this definitely ranks among my least favorite. What a disappointment. Yes, the book has it moments where the writing genius prevalent throughout Cold Mountain shines through, but those moments are few and far between. Call it the sophomore jinx, or attribute it to the fact that the $8 million Frazer received as advance quenched his creative fire. Call it what you want. This book just doesn't add up and is a waste of your time. The story line and Native American history is fascinating, but the novel meanders and plods, and just never gains any sense of rhythm or momentum. There is little evidence of the writing chops that earned Frazier the critical acclaim he so richly deserved for Cold Mountain. A shame."
2,Did I miss something too?,"Like an earlier reviewer, I wonder what I missed that others did not. Though the author writes beautiful prose, I think his story (or the lack of one) makes for one of the most boring and uninteresting novels I have ever read. I recommend that you not waste your valuable time reading this novel."
3,"Fun, but.....","It is really fun and challenging the first time you play, but once you beat it, it doesn't change. It becomes non challenging and boring, because it's too easy. If you like playing a game over and over again, and still be challenged, don't buy this game."
2,I Liked the Dogs...,"This story was slow to begin with, then excruciatingly slow with the rescue and Matt Star's agony in the wilderness. Lily Harper is NOT charming; she's boring, silly, and screams a lot like a teenager with PMS. The dialog goes too far explaining things to the reader as if they're too slow to understand this formula read without longwinded explanations and, in the end, the one character I truly did have interest in, Betsy Collins, turned into another Lily. Just what we need.I will give Michaels kudos for making the dogs Buzz and Gracie so smart, loyal, and likeable. She proves by her treatment of those two characters that she is a dog lover, and that scores big points in my book. Still, sorry Fern, you've written a few good books; unfortunately, this just isn't one of them."
4,THE LAST GREAT MALMSTEEN ALBUM PERHAPS ...?????,"This is perhaps, depending on your point of view, the last worthwhile Malmsteen album. After this release, Malmsteen was plagued by personal problems, worst of them his terrible car crash who almost claimed his life. After TRILOGY, Malmsteen hired pop singer Joe Lynn Turner and released the pop ODYSSEY, with totally AOR lyrical themes. Malmsteen went on to concentrate apparently only in his mind-numbing ""shredding"" technique, when vibe and emotion never more returned to his music. TRILOGY is already more pop oriented than his two previous releases, but still manages to have something special surrounding its songs."
3,good,"Singer Mark Goals tried hard, and the result was a very good album. It is a shame the singer lasted so short.."

1,Wrong ITEM by AMAZON,"I bought this rings by doing a search through Amazon's site. Parameter of the search were: ""leupold 3/8 rings"" on the result I got ""Leupold Rifleman Rimfire 3/8"""" Ringmount Matte 56533"" with the picture of them as well.Leupold Rifleman Rimfire 3/8"""" Ringmount Matte 56533However when I received these rings they are NOT intended for 3/8 rails they are weaver instead!!!Now I tried to returned them, although I could not since these are sold by LG and I did open the package to try to install them only to figure out amazon is responsable for the mistake...."
3,Few good songs,"The Allman Brothers Band obviously weren't The Allman Brothers Band when this album came out. But Dickey Betts really steps up writing some great tunes. I think ""Pegasus"" is just as good an instrumental as they've ever done. The ending is crazy! Also, ""Try It One More Time"" is an extremely underated song and should be heard by anyone who thinks after Duane died the band died."
3,Good for new Miller fans; skippable for old hands,"This is a very well done album featuring basic Miller. I would recommend it for someone who wants to know a little bit about Miller or who simply wants to engage in nostalgia. If you wnat to hear what Miller actually sounded like in all his richness, I suggest some of the live albums. Skip the Andrews Sister album--it features too little Miller to really appreciate the vast store of sounds and moods which the live programs afford. Similarly there are some broader collections that will give you a more rounded appreciation of Miller in the studio--even though Miller tended not to record his more spectacular arrangements--such as the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto, April in Paris, V for Victory Hop, the Red Calvary March and so forth. So, if you want something to listen to on your veranda, this will do well--if you want something that will stick to your ribs, you must go further afield.Tim H. BlessingAssociate Professor of HistoryAlvernia College"
4,missing two good ones!,"Miller is always latent with people that appreciates good american popular music; Miller today sounds as good as 59 years ago when our musical world lost him for ever. It has beenproclaimed that actually the conception of the Miller sound(a clarinet on the lead of the sax section) it was actually created by the british composer and band leader Ray Noble, undoubtedly it was Miller who brought the conception to the spot light of big band music and when every listener around the world hears the combination of clarinet in the lead, automatically thinks of Miller. It results interesting that clarinetists band leaders like Shaw and Goodman, it never ocurred to them to use(or create) such nice sound combination. But there are two excellent Miller performances that are missed from this collection; the instrumental ""Sunrise Serenade"" and ""A Handful of Stars"" with a vocal refrain by Ray Eberle."
4,"Hit or miss, second time was the charm for me","I bought two of these, only the second one worked for the long term. The first one charged and seemed to work for a while. When I first charged it, it topped off at approx 67% charge. Then it slowly (over 2 weeks) would top off at lower and lower percentages. Finally, it wouldn't charge anymore.The second one started at 100% and charges back to 100%.Bottom line: the quality is hit or miss, but if you're lucky, it will work fine."
4,Cute but you'll need to eat something else with it!,"I haven't opened the package as this is a Xmas gift for my son, so I guessed about the durability, ed. value, and fun based on my experience as a preschool teacher and with felt products. These are VERY cute but the quantity you get is much less than the product image leads you to believe. Perhaps I should have read the description more closely? In any case, I'm sure my son will enjoy cooking them up in his new play kitchen!"
2,"""You Won't See Me"" listening to this cd","this is basically a kidz bop bashing of old beatles' songs.i personally don't like it,almost hate it, but you very well might. most of the songs i find a little irritating, but not the songs themselves, just the cover of them. if you're a beatles fan, you might not like these songs so DON'T buy it unless you're sure, but if you have kids and are willing to compromise(or just like them this way) go ahead,it's your money, not mine. besides, it's better than some of the other kids albums out there. oh yeah, it's more of a 2 1/2, if you care."
4,Great shoe - seems to run alittle small,"I love this shoe! Perfect for the spring. The shoe feels very comfortable with the exception of the toe box, it seems to run a little small. I normally wear a size 7M ... but I am returning my 7s for a pair of 7.5s. I can't wait to wear these out and about!"
2,An old and uneven selection,"There are a few quite good letters here, but many of them appear to have been selected either because the writer was famous or the editor was just desperate to fill the book. Nearly all of them are from before WW2 and most are from before the 20th century. As a result, most of the letters have language that would seem very stilted if used today. But even old age doesn't excuse the writing that in some cases made me cringe."
4,Better Performance,"I installed on two 2003 GMC Envoys and both have had an increase in mileage (2-3 mpg) and slightly better acceleration. These filters did not turn my SUV's into race cars, but I did notice better performace than with stock paper filter."
5,Garfield DVD,Received the DVD in a timely manner and in excellent condition. It was reasonably priced and was given as a Christmas gift.
3,Not as good as the First,"While Garfield 2 was semi-entertaining, it lacked the neatly-timed humor and sight gags that made the first one so well worth the time and money. It also lacked the cute cuddliness that made Garfield a big star in the first place. I'm not upset that I bought it, but it will not get that much playtime at our house."
4,Very helpful,"Pros: Easy to use, just get to the UK and pop the mini SD in and your running. We didn't even buy a map of the UK.Cons: It does not have the little stuff, if you get off the main roads onto the little fun roads many will not be on the GPS. One township had been in the same spot from before the birth of Jesus Christ, no where on the Garmin system.Bottom line: I would use it again, dollars well spent, just know the limitations before you use it. It would have been helpful if we would have bought a map to support it, but we made it without one."
4,Europe Maps,"We just used our Garmin Streetpilot C340 with the Europe maps fortwo weeks. Our tour included the cities of Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Geneva. I would have been lost without our GPS. The major roadsand highways are generally well marked from city to city. Once yougo into the cities or looking for specific address this is the way to go.I would never travel without a GPS. The maps were about as accurate asthe US maps and POI was good. The real joy is not to worry about lookingfor street names or where to turn. Our only issue was in the city with narrow streets and loss of signal, but this happens in anywhere. Cost vs. peace of mind -- It's not cheap driving in Europe. Just program your locations and have fun touring Europe."
1,What a disappointment,"We ordered this product so my husband could use it when he goes into Canada to go fishing. The description said it was for all of Canada, but it only gives us two prov. I have contacted the seller to try and return it, but they are ignoring me. I have never had such lousy service from an Amazon vendor before."
3,Just returned from Europe,"We just returned form travel in Hungary, Croatia and Slovania for 3 weeks. The main roads were programed and major cities with populations of over 50,000 (just guessing) Most secondary roads to small cities and villages were not on the card. Cities like Budapest were well maped but limited info entertainment - probably 20% of the major hotels were maped. Opera houses and airports were targets Croatia had less roads programed and Slovania even less. we didnt get into western europe. I assume it is better their.Garmin City Navigator NT SD Data Card for Garmin GPS Units, Europe (010-10680-00)"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"After losing his road train and being captured by th e Mutes, Stevereturns to the Amtrak federation. They, however, don't trust him, andbanish him to be a lowly garbo.The First Family overlords, characters in the book, have their ownagenda, which Brickman is part of. He has his own, as well, and theAmtrak Federation is right to be watching him, as Mr. Snow has plansfor him, too."
2,So So,I have quite a few of this authors books and this is not Lashner's best book. I was disappointed in the storyline and the characters in the book.
2,Be careful of the Kindle version,"This is a review NOT of the book but of the Kindle version of the book. The book itself is excellent. BUT, the Kindle version omits the maps and the character list at the beginning. These are essentials for reading a Dorothy Dunnett novel. This was my first Dorothy Dunnett novel, AND my first Kindle book. Dorothy get five stars, Kindle gets two. This was not prepared well for the Kindle format. Had I not had a copy of the book itself, I would have been unaware of these omissions. I trust that future Dorothy Dunnett novels will prove as wonderful as this one. Kindle is a great technology, and the preparation of materials needs to be undertaken with the same care that has gone into developing the reader itself."
5,The Best of Lymond,"I've now read five of the six books in the Lymond series and Pawn is the best. It is filled with action (Lymond's knife fights in the surf of North Africa with his arch-enemy), changes of scene (from Europe to Tripoli to Greece to Constantinople), double crosses, danger (Philippa in the harem), and one of the most compelling scenes in historical fiction (the live chess game).These books are hard--there's nothing easy about them, but they are the best of historical fiction--true to the history, but plotted to make you anxious to keep going. Beneath the surface are some interrelatiohships (e.g., Lymond and Marthe) that are enigmatic, to say the least. All of these give reason to keep reading to the end.While I'm no historian of the middle ages, I have the impression which others confirm that Dunnett is giving us as accurate a picture of a long past era as we're likely to get from modern writers.This is a real triumph in the art of historical fiction."
3,so so yoga,"this is mostly breathing and tapping. (i think tapping is ridiculous) very few yoga exercises in here. i did like the instructor and it's a gentle, relaxing dvd, but if you want to get stronger, this is not the dvd for you."
3,Cool album.,"I've always liked Bark at the Moon. There's some cool material throughout. It's a solid hard rock album. Ozzy's vocals are energetic. He's got a unique and cool voice. All nine of the tracks are listenable. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. This re-mastered version sounds much better than the previous version. ""Spiders in the Night"" is also a cool bonus track. Jake ""E"" Lee does well with the guitar playing. I also like the album's keyboard playing. My favorite songs are ""You're No Different"" and ""Waiting for Darkness."" The lyrics to ""You're No Different"" are really good. ""Waiting for Darkness"" is one of Ozzy's best songs. The photos in the CD booklet are also interesting. Bark at the Moon is a good album. Worth a listen."
1,Bruce Dickinson RUINED this remastered version,"Do not buy this 2002 version of Bark at the Moon. Only buy the 1995 remastered version. I'm not sure what possessed Bruce Dickinson to do what he did to this album as the producer, but he ruined an Ozzy masterpiece. Dickinson, you are incompetent! RUIN your own crappy albums and leave Ozzy's stuff alone. Although I wouldn't recommend the Bark at the Moon album for a first time Ozzy listener or buyer, it is still a great album. The title track is one of my favorite Ozzy songs, plus Rock and Roll Rebel and Waiting for Darkness. You have to listen deeply to get what Ozzy's about on this album. I consider this Ozzy's real first solo album because after Randy Rhoads died, Ozzy became the boss."
2,FAKE,"I used to enjoy Ozzy a lot but, since I've learned some weird things about his business practices, I must admit it became harder and harder for me to distinguish between his persona and his work.Of course I still love BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN (the ones featuring the ORIGINAL bass player and drummer, not the re-recorded trash Ozzy released in 2002. Even BARK AT THE MOON is very good. But to learn that Ozzy , for a great part of his career, did no write EVEN THE LYRICS for his albums is something shocking.In BARK AT THE MOON, free from Kerslake and using Bob Daisley as a last moment replacement, he credited himself as the sole composer for all the songs, that were, in truth, written by Daisley and Jake E. Lee....Amazing."
2,asdf,"if you like Jake E Lee's playing, then you might as well grab this album, otherwise, its a throw-away release with one or two standout tracks"
5,Screams break the Silence,"This album rocks. Now You See It is one of the best Ozzy songs ever! If you like Ozzy you'll love this album, buy it or Your'e No Different then a rock critic."
2,A major setback after 2 brilliant albums,"This one is not that bad. However, it lames so much when compared to Ozzy's two previous albums. Jake E Lee does a decent job, but he fell way short in trying to recapture the magic that Ozzy had with the late great Randy Rhoads. ""Bark at the Moon"" is a great song but the majority of the other songs in the album are simply not in the same league of Blizzard's and Diary's. There was a lot of expectation before the album came out back in '83; unfortunately, it certainly did not lived up to it."
5,Ozzys 2nd best Album !,"While not as good as Diary in my mind its better than Blizzard because its a more rounded album with the best songs being the title track , Im so Tired , Rock and Roll Rebel and Journey to the center of Eternity ! Blizzard has its moments but Bark is his second best solo album ! A earlier reviewer said Bark was a failer but it went platinum which in todays terms is Gold ! Great cd to own if ur a Ozzy fan!"
3,beegee review,"I have to admit, I was disappointed initially because I thought the ""best of"" the Bee Gees would include Saturday Night Fever, but no, songs were earlier. However once I listed to the CD, I found it very good, quality, songs, voices, so overall I do like it. But I still wish it included SNF."
1,4 minutes possibly interesting,"If, and I do mean if, you advance to one hour and ten minutes, for a few minutes, this movie is almost interesting but that is it."
3,A question for the author,"I have a question for the author of this book. And that is,"" What is the purpose of revealing this information?"" As far as I can understand all that it will do is give information to US enemies, and upset ongoing intelligence operations.Every author wants recognition and publicity. But there are certain things which should not be published even if we know them. The loyalty to one's country and its purposes should transcend one's own ambition."
5,How do you review a piece of pipe?,Very nice piece of pipe. This rod matches the fan color and is quite sturdy. Exactly what was expected. The length is correct.
3,A mystery film to collect,"for people who like to collect films like this, I recommend it, is not bad or good, but its content is something that draws attention, to see it everywhere I had to buy it I do not regret any, for my taste of hundred mysterious is good, because it was very mysterious success on the big screen"
3,fun,"Bought this a couple of years ago for someone. Watched the whole movie and it was fairly tolerable to sit through. It was a gift for a young person used to living out in the sticks pretty much. It is probably extremely entertaining for those living the life of the movie, ""The Deliverance""."
4,gas powered stink,My freind had gotten a gas powered pocket rocket for christmas and a electric one. He got his from the same site as said in one of the reviews on this page. and he has had not one problem out of his electric one. but has had many problems with his gas powered one . And right now he has not been able to get his gas one to run for a month.He also paid 400 dollars on his w/the electic start and all.My freind told me if he could go back he would have gotten 2 electric ones instead.Im going to go buy one of my own.
5,Speak of the Ozz,"I love this album. However, this cd remaster is missing a song.... and it's not SweatLeaf. The cassette version that I have has the song that's missing, but I lost the cassette insert... I have yet to find the song. But in either case, I love the cd."
3,An energetic live album.,"This is quite an impressive live performance from Ozzy Osbourne. All of the tunes are Black Sabbath songs. It's easy to get into Speak of the Devil. Ozzy's banter with the audience is really cool and adds a spark to the album. I prefer the live versions of these Black Sabbath tunes to the studio ones. Ozzy does an energetic and satisfying job with the vocals. Brad Gillis also does an impressive job with the guitar playing. The other members of the band perform well, also. This re-mastered version sounds really nice. All of the tunes on Speak of the Devil are good. The guitar playing on the intro of ""Symptom of the Universe"" is cool. That's a heavy track. I don't have any favorite tracks. They're all good. Speak of the Devil is a better-than-good live album. I actually give it 3.5 stars. It's well worth a listen."
5,LETS HAVE A RIOT!,"All you have to do for a good old fasioned rock'n'roll riot is slip ""Speak of the Devil"" in your loudest sound system. The king of metal is sensational in concert as well as in the studio. We already knew that but he had added pressure that he overcame on this concert album. His lead guitarist and best freind at that time died in a bizaar accident not long be fore that particular concert. Which explains why it's all Sabbath Material. Ozzy felt like it wouldn't be right morally to do Randy's songs. Not only that he wouldn't be oble to go through with it emotionally. So the Sabbath covers make up the album. The best covers in the opinion of many people. Listen to ""WAR PIGS"" it's great. It all is."
2,I didn't *want* to be disappointed...,"I was really looking forward to anything else by Braun that dealt with Moose County inhabitants, et al., but although it does indeed live up to its title, this small book has little of the charm of the longer ""Cat Who..."" novels. Jim Qwilleran is the collector and faithful scribe of these tales; there is (appropriately although sadly) no sign of either KoKo or Yum Yum to brighten the pages. The tales are for the most part VERY short as is the book itself (see previous review re: white space and value for $$) and didn't last me an hour altogether. I was disappointed as the tales themselves didn't seem to have the color of Braun's other novels and short as they were, seemed to drag. I *love* the actual ""Cat Who"" series and even though the series has deteriorated somewhat (there have been almost 30 of them, after all), I look forward to the next installment!"
1,"Really, A Waste Of Time","One has to wonder if the author simply cannot come up with any more mysteries for Qwill to solve; these were too short, too abrupt, too ""re-runnish""--we have read some of these elsewhere in her work--and simply too flat. No substance, and the terseness makes them one-dimensional. Why does Qwill sound like a pompous ass in the few interjections he makes herein? The author cannot be so strapped for money she is simply trying to cash in on the past, can she? One hopes not indeed, because of the many past hours of reading pleasure she has afforded us."
5,Excellent CD from a very talented singer/songwriter,"This CD is excellent! It's one of those albums that you can listen to from start to finish without skipping a track. John Mayer is an extremely talented musician, and his lyrics come straight from the heart. I'm about the same age as John Mayer, and I find myself relating to every song, and as a guitar player, I am very inspired by his musicianship. Rickey Wright's editorial review of ""Room For Squares"" could not be more absurd -don't listen to this nonsense! Take a chance like I did and buy the CD - you won't be dissappointed."
2,oh no,I cant believe how much this guy copies Dave Mathews. I was hoping to listen to something different but I got nothing but crap. He even copies Dave Mathews dance when he is playing in concert. What a total loser.
2,Mayer Shmayer get your own style dammit!,"I hope that the people who are writing these reviews understand that the only reason this guy has gotten any hype is because the only people who listen to him are highschoolers whose taste in music doesn't go beyond brittany and NSYNC. I bought this CD at the recommendation of a friend and personally he couldn't have been more wrong. Out of all the tracks there are only 2 that are noteworthy the rest are trash-if only this CD had a erase option on it. There are moments on this CD where you can swear that he is trying to be like Dave Matthews which coincidentally he enjoys ripping on at his concerts-so much for respect. If I were you I would avoid this CD-check out some other noteworthy artists such as Norah Jones, Howie Day, and Jack Johnson. Sure they may not be as popular as Mayer but at least they have their own style and don't need to ride another persons coat tails to stardom...."
1,Tripe,"I can't believe people buy this tripe! In fact, I'd rather consume pounds of tripe rather than listen to John Mayer, if in fact that is his real name.I didn't think there could be anyone duller than Dave Matthews, but WE HAVE A WINNER! His name is John Mayer!"
2,Room for originality.,"The music's fine, some would say good. Points off for cheating. There are too many similarities to Dave Matthews to be coincidental. Watch tapes of the two performing, reminds me of Belushi and Cocker on SNL. Add some brass, a fiddle, and it'd be a good tribute band. the Mave Datthews band."
3,It's like this:,"I agree John Mayer is a killer musician. His songs aren't easy to play by any means. And I'd also agree he's a great songwriter.. One of those album's lyrics that stick with you and you can really relate to. (My stupid mouth, Love song for no one, ect.) But, I hated the cd. I have all of the songs downloaded off the internet, and the majority of them are acoustic and live. When I heard the CD tracks, or when I hear it in somebody's car it makes me want to turn it off. Yet the cd I burnt of his live acoustic stuff doesn't leave my cd player. You can really feel this album and John hearing the acoustic and I definately think he should put out an album of his live stuff. Room for Squares seriously doesn't compare."
1,Crap,"Bland... This album represents everything that is wrong with popular music today. When you're trying to emulate Dave Matthews, you know you're in trouble."
5,Johnny is the best!,"John Mayer is awesome! he sings, plays guitar and writes his own songs- what more could you want? one reviewer said that they thought his lyrics were immature and simplistic, but thats part of whats good, he just puts it out there, theres nothing cryptic about his songs. One of the best CDs in my collection. everybody should definately have it"
2,Snoozer +2,"I do not understand all the hype this guy has received. The big problem with this CD is not, as the Amazon.com reviewer quite correctly (and humorously) point out, the pretentious, ""look at my deep thoughts"" coffehouse lyrics. With John, it's as another reviewer pointed out, the same ""look at me ma"" jazzy chords. Unfortunately, they're not some of the cool jazzy chords that most rock's peppered with, but the entire CD is one terrible smooth jazz chord after another. This isn't musical complexity, it's pseudo-jazzy blandness. The only people we have to thank for this kind of nonsense is John Tesh and Steely Dan (although Dan actually tried something new from time to time)."
5,Great Cd,This cd is great!! I had never heard of him until like 3 days ago and when I heard the first song I was instantly hooked. His style is similar to that of Dave Matthews band but his own originality shines through. I just saw him in concert and he is awesome! Buy this cd today. You wont be dissapointed.
4,"Dave Matthews meets David Gray, with a twist","I have been listening to this album for a couple of days now. Up until I got it, I had only heard (ad nauseam) the very popular opening track, ""No Such Thing"". Now, taking a few hard listens to the album, I can see where all buzz comes from. Indeed, John Mayer's voice sounds A LOT like Dave Matthews' and his music does resemble in more than one way David Gray's (remember ""Babylon""), but Mayer does show that he's got something that needs to be respected.His singing (though similar to DM) is very good, and his guitar-playing can be very heartfelt and intimate. However, I find him particularly interesting as a composer (both lyrics and music): like another reviewer, I loved ""Great Indoors"" (as an example). In sum, this is an album well worth paying attention to, as well as to his career. I am honestly glad that he didn't get stuck on this one album like so many one-album wonders in the past (Martin Page would be a good example)."
4,Don't overlook this emerging artist!!!,"This is a great CD! Though not mainstream, Mayer is a young talented artist, coming to the music scene. He has been compared to the greats (i.e. DMB and David Gray) but he has his own original sound and endearing lyrics (if not always profound). I really appreciate the lighthearted sound and attitude. Everyone needs to hear an optimistic view every once in a while. Mayer supplies this with pleasure! Songs like Why Georgia and 3x5 are catchy and satisfying. At the end of the day, he is a great guitarist with a gorgeous voice (not hard on the eyes either!) and at the top of my list."
3,Ashley's review,"I listened to the whole album and even some of his ""older stuff"" and find his music relaxing. It's not the best written music you will hear or the best guitar riffs but its definitly better than the stuff they play on the top 40 radio stations. Some ""hard hitting"" music review people will bash it and say it has no substance but I totally disagree. John Mayer said it best ""Even if I music connects with just one person I have truely accomplished something."" I think Mayer has touched many with mellow lyrics. My favorite song is ""citylove"" it sounds different from the rest of the album. While his music is touching the lyrics seem like they need more work. But all in all John Mayer has something. I reccomend it to anyone wanting to hear something a little different."
2,It works if you're 18-22,"Don't get me wrong - ""No Such Thing"" is a good pop song. In fact, my kids and I enjoy the song a lot and hence we bought the CD. ""Why Georgia"" also is fairly catchy. I also like the liner notes and the Periodic Table of the Elements graphic on the CD. But, the remainder of the album is all about looking back on the good ol' high school days - something John Mayer has been out of for, what, three years?The album has a very monotone sound with the same tempo and feel and same chord structure song after song. I imagine that the lyrics have some relevance to those in the teen/ early twenty set - probably the group that he is aimed at - but I don't get it. As an example, having John dream about what it will be like to go back to his 10 year high school reunion just does not resonate.Maybe John Mayer will be worth listening to when he actually lives life for a while. In the mean time, buy his CD single and forget the album"
2,No Heart,"OK, John, im sorry but a 2 was reluctantly given by me. I know of several of my friends that greatly enjoy Mayer's music, but personally, I find it rather bland. Yes, he does have a unique and talented voice, however, his lyrics lack on the inspring side. Without true inspiration, all you have is a good voice with no heart. That is what John Mayer is. Perhaps inspiration will be found by him in the future, but I doubt it. So if you enjoy mindless uninspiring music then buy this CD and listen to it. But I enjoy musicians that offer something in their music."
4,Good Listener,"Critics, critics. So many like ""Mr Wright"" are often too judgemental of new artists. Certainly these critics that are so eager to bash a new artist also realize just how difficult it must be to produce such quality music. That is, of course, if they actually tried. So what if he sounds similar to Dave Mathews? So what if he's young and expresses himself in a way that shows his age? Do you think John Mayer contemplated even once..""Maybe I should keep my music to myself since I sound similar to someone else"". I'm glad he didnt. How many of us ""older"" fans have truly enjoyed seeing the development of greats like Eric Clapton? More power to ya John Mayer! For a debut album, John Mayer, you must be very proud of your accomplishment and I'm eager to see how your talents develop."
4,Flashback,"I really like this CD...but am I the only one who thinks John Mayer must be related to Michael Franks, soft Jazz singer popular in the late 70's, early 80's? Similar voices...same rhythms."
4,Back To Musics Roots,"I love John Mayer! His music is really sensual and sweet. A lot of people compare him to Dave Matthews and there is a simmilarity in style, but they are both amazing on their own. I am frustrated that he is never on the radio or anything, well not the stations I listen to. He goes back to the roots of music where you write and play and preform your own songs, but he doesnt go crazy like a lot of other pop artists. He has the smoothness of country with the catchiness of pop. If you like DMB or country music I reccomend this. It's the best."
1,Dave Matthews + Dave Matthews + Dave Mattews,Is this Dave Play or Cold Mayer or John Matthews? I can't keep track anymore. Dave had a couple good tunes. I don't understand why anyone cares anymore or even wants to copy him so much.
5,John's more than a good lyricist,"What is up with this Ricky guy? Was he listening to this cd or did he get mixed up because I don't know that you can complain about anything on it. There is way more to his music than his lyrics. He's one of the best guitarists I have heard. This is the coolest cd I have heard in a while. It's got a great range of songs, most of them sounding pretty mellow. My favorites, well I love thme all. If you like DMB or Ben Folds, get this CD. If you don't but you are looking for something new get this cd. Everyone just buy this CD."
5,John Mayer,"John Mayer's Room for Squares CD is absolutely one of the best CDs that I have purchased in several years. Lyrically and musically, this young talent has recorded a near-perfect album. It is one of the few CDs that I can listen to from beginning to end without skipping through several tracks. There is an honesty present in his songs that is difficult to describe, but still refreshing. After becoming hooked on RFS, I then downloaded some of his live performances off of morpheus. His live performances truly show his talent and forecast his promising future. I wholeheartedly endorse this album."
4,great hooks,"I couldn't disagree more with the first review of this wellcrafted and down right fun cd. First of all,"" No Such Thing"" is such a breath of fresh air, compared to most of the mindless drivel on pop radio today. And while I am a fan of Dave MatthewsI think comparisons are unfair. I think Mayer's sound is Uniqueand stands on its own merit. The songs are pop for sure but thereis great guitar work and his lyrics are more insightful and certainly more understandable than some. Great guitar riffs andhooks and just plain good songs. Certainly a welcome sound in Todays era of Technopop and Boy Bands."
1,Room for squares,John fits right in. More of the same watered down pop princess guitar work from this overrated loser.
5,The Best CD,"This CD has been in my Car for 3 months straight. I've seen John in concert 3 times and he is the best artist out there. Every song on this CD is awesome! There is not one song that I don't love...which is really rare. He is an extremely talented guitar player and his lyrics are not over the top; they're perfect. I love his lyrics, they're extremely creative and unique. His music, infiltrated with his jazz roots, is indescribeable. I gave this CD as a Christmas present to several people and would HIGHLY recommend it!"
4,Awesome cd,I love John Mayer at certain times. He's kalm and has a certain whit to his music. It's the perfect easy listening cd for dining with my girlfriend or reading a book on the train.I actually prefer this album over his newer album but that's a personal choice.
2,Not worth listening to,"but ohh man will you get a buzz off of putting it in a microwave for 10 seconds and opening the door real fast and taking a big wiff! That's about all this generic CD is worth for, the mind-altering chemicals that are used to physically compose the CD. Now, I'm off to try to use the CD booklet as a means of rolling up a fatty."
3,Excellent Mood,"I discovered John Mayer through the song ""83"" -- his track on the Serendipity soundtrack. Like that song, this album is defined by an appealingly mellow folk/rock sound, and fits nicely on my shelf next to other male pop/folk/rock artists like Duncan Sheik and David Gray. The lyrics may not be anything particularly meaningful, but they're basically harmless. This is an excellent album for servicing romantically angsty moods."
5,a lyrical wonderland,"john mayer combines great funky acoustics with lyrics ranging from provocative to amusing. it's great fun to listen to in any mood. it reminds me of a boy a used to know, bob cantoni, a lyrical genious himself. memories are always better with a soundtrack. this one definitely delivers. enjoy."
3,Worth buying..,"I'm a new to John Mayer, but i do now consider myself a fan. this album is worth buying in my eyes. it gives you a very good sense of what john mayer is all about. his music is unique and beautiful in both lyrics and music. i would recommend this album in a heart beat as well as his live album. john mayer rocks and i will def. be getting his future albums. Props to john!"
5,5 Stars for a CD I'll never play again,"There's no question that John Mayer is going to be around for a long time.I've been hearing so much about this New Artist that I had to buy ""Room For Squares."" I love the first single,""No Such Thing,""also,""Why Georgia,City Love"" and ""Neon,"" but after awhile,all of the 14cuts sound alike.Maybe one of these days I'll Cherish this CD,but not TODAY."
2,He's young and having fun...,"I think Louis Armstrong was the person that said that there are two kinds of music- 'good music and bad music'. Well, John Mayer seems to have created a new kind of music- 'hollow'. This guy needs to sit at the feet of real musicians if he wants to have a career in music. I hope John does not end up on the ever growing scrap heap of pop stars because he does have potential. However, this album is premature. Hopefully, John Mayer will someday look back on this album and be able to say ""Oh God, what was I thinking""."
3,Toys,"I bought this toy for my grandson when he was four. Sounds kind of young for this type of toy I know, but he is a very intelligent child and was learning about money and was even schooled in ATM machines, My daughter has told me this is a wonderful tool,but shortly after he received it the coin mechanism became jammed and my son-in-law had to keep un-jamming it. She says that to this day it is still jammed and a hassle to work on all the time. My son-in-law was unsuccessful the last time he tried to un-jam it so it sits in Lian's closet, unused."

3,Stiff keys...,"I've found lots of people complaining about this calculator loosing the keys. They float and pops out.Then I bought mine and HP had already fixed this problem (you find out from the serial number). But the keys were way stiffer to press. You are used to 48, forget this and buy a 50g. They fixed the keys again and made them softer."
4,"Good, but the TI is better","If you're looking at this calculator because it has RPN, buy the TI-89. There is a free 3rd party program to make the ti-89 as good an RPN calculator as any HP (and I've had a lot of HPs).If you're looking at this calculator because it has a graphic equation editor, buy the ti-89 because there is a free (or much better but a little money) third party program to do graphic equation editing on the ti-89 (it's actually better than the app in the hp).Also, the TI does not have graphing issues, is simpler to use, has a huge user base, and is well documented."
3,Hersch's strongest playing yet.,"Pianist Fred Hersch is mostly known for his sensitive piano trio work. Duets with guitarist Bill Frisell and numerous albums of standards are the backbone of his available catalog. This album finds the keyboardist expanding his ensemble to a quintet and raising the energy level quite a bit as a result.Adding tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby and trumpeter Ralph Alessi to the trio raises the stakes on this recording session. Their presence pushes Hersch into a more energetic role and the group benefits. Where other Hersch recordings have seemed tame and perhaps overly safe in comparison, Trio + 2 is a fine example of the sort of swinging straight ahead modern jazz Hersch is capable of. It's the underlying subtlety and nuance that these five musicians have together that establishes this variation on Hersch's basic trio as his strongest and most diverse ensemble yet."
3,Looked Like Poison IVY 2 On My Player,My DVD copy was really Poison IVY 2 - Not at all what I expected! Newline should really take more care making sure the artwork / labels match the data on the disk.
4,Better than the first Austin Powers,Much better than the first austin powers. Much more funny. You get to know doctor evil a lot more. Also he seems less evil. funnier more relaxed than in the first one. This movie is more fun to watch than the first.
2,Lacking,"This movie lacks any basis that could remotely pass as a plot. The only thing that makes this funny is Mini-Me, and he isn't in all that much of the show. The one place this would be good for is a group gathering when everyone is looking for a laugh, even if the laugh is focused at what a poor showing it has."
2,"A recast of the first Austin Powers, less the originality","Liking the first Austin Powers, I gave this a try. Unfortunately, I found little new from the first. The same basic jokes. It had a couple of good one liners, and the character of Mini-Me saved the show from bombing completely, but all in all hardly worth seeing. The only new jokes were so far ""over the top"" that they didn't add, just detracted because of the lengths they had to go to get there. All in all, this makes a poor followup to a great original movie."
1,The spy who put me to sleep(1 star is too much),"I would call this the worse film ever made, but some of my favorite films have been described as the worse film ever made so I cannot put this film in that category because even the title of worse film ever made gives this film too much recognition, got it? First of all, what was the point of MINI ME? The only gag was that he is short..OH a handicap joke, I'm laughing so hard!! How Funny!! Putting a handicapped man in the film for everyone to laugh at, gee Mike Meyers your fabulous..and the guy is a terrible actor anyway..2nd thing is, the scene where Austin, in a split screen, is talking to himself from 10 minutes in the future is so badly put together that it makes The Patty Duke show seem like cutting edge technology..Oh and gee Austin Power's assistant takes on a lesbian lover with a uni-brow, will the pure genius comedy ever stop? Mr. Meyers your 15 minutes of fame is over,please, please, go away, far, far away from my dvd player as possible..."
1,A major letdown,"I saw this film hoping to see another great spy parody, but I was very very disapointed. The first movie was very funny and it had a lot of great spoofs and jokes, but this one just recycled some of the old jokes and tryed to parody pop culture. I sat through this whole movie and the only funny part was when they were in the tent. The rest was just a very bad ""comedy"". If you want a funny spy parody I suggest that you see the first one skip this one."
2,I dunno what I was thinking...,"Acually I hated this movie. I saw it 3 times and I just don't like it. These kinda movies are very stupid, no plot no satisfaction! But all I gotta say is:THIS MOVIE IS TERORABLE!!"
2,Very Disappointing,"When I've seen this movie at cinema everybody was laughing but me; I felt very bad! Probably I wasn't in the right mood. I mean, I love slapstick comedies, and I've liked the first Austin Power, but this is nothing compared. The storyline is nonsense, there is no clue beetween scenes and a lack of originality. However I'm looking forward for the next Mike Myer's movie."
1,Highly disappointing.,"Highly disappointing. Seemed like the move was one big commercial (either for a Beer or a Car or a certain British Airline), got to love that product placement revenue! Jokes must have been the out takes from the original move. Skip this move and see the first one."
2,Boring and pointless.,"No other movie in history has been destroyed nearly as much as this one has by it's own fans. Through irritating repetition of such phrases as ""Yeah, baby, yeah"" and ""shagadelic,"" many AP fans have turned the original movie into a breeding ground for irritating stand-up comedian wannabes.The problem, then, with the sequel to Austin Powers is that it does very little except re-hash those same catch phrases and pair them up with needless gross-out scenes. The end result is a movie that is disgusting, annoying, and ultimately very dull.To be fair, there are one or two funny scenes in this movie. Myers does a pretty good job of handling his characters, but he only has enough material for about half of a script--and so, the other half of the movie is comprised of saying the first half over again and hoping that you won't notice.It's a sad day when you see a movie that has so little inspiration running for it when it has to repeat itself--...!Still, it's better than ""Goldmember""...."
3,Okay if you don't watch it more than 6 times,I watched this movie numerous times and I thought it was okay the first 3 times. But when you watch it more and more it gets old. Kind of when you watch the Saved By The Bell episod more then once. I did like the first one though. I would like to watch both of them one after another and it would give it a real kick. Well I guess that is it... Thanks
5,PURE GENIUS!,"Oh, please do over analyze this masterpiece! Each time you watch this mooovie, you will find it more and more hilarious. Mike Meyer's transformation of language (as well as physical humor) is awesome. ""It has a certain, as the French say, I don't know what!"". The margarine of evil...Right...Zip it...Ivana Humpalot...We don't knaw on the kitty...You complete me...Baby Back Ribs...Testicles, specticles, wallet & watch...it just goes on and on and on. Almost everyday, no, EVERYDAY, something reminds me of this movie. Yes, I do have a life but I am totally obsessed with the Spy who shagged me. Signed, Hopelessly Laughing"
1,"predictable story line full of used, well worn cliches","I could not wait to see this movie based on word of mouth hype. What a shocking disappointment. It was singularly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The dialogue was diabolically bad. Even in its basest form, a total waste of money. If you must see this out of curiosity, rent, don't buy."
2,Uh... what IS this crud?,"This game just doesn't feel good. (Quake II for the N64 feels good. Turok 2 and Turok Rage Wars feel good.) But everything about the interface and gameplay is just plain awkward.Aside from gameplay, the game's interfaces are all very poorly done. Want to change your controller options? You have a choice between Regular, and Alt1, Alt2 and Alt3 -- but there are no diagrams to explain what those different options even mean!And even if the feel of the game was good, and the menus weren't confusing -- the missions are poor. In my last game (and I mean my *last* game) I spent the last 5 minutes running around thinking ""what am I supposed to be doing now"", until my character became accidentally lodged in a wall and couldn't break free. Boy, that's good fun.There's not even a demo or opening animation to watch at the beginning of the game.How the venerable Iguana studios (creators of the Turok games) let this half finished crock out the door is beyond me."
5,For the Mecano lover at heart.,"If you consider yourself a Mecano fan, that this is the CD to own. In it you will find some of the more popular hits from this infamous Spaniard trio, LIVE! ! ! Experience the thrill of hearing ""Japon"", ""Hoy no me puedo levanter"" and one of there most representative songs ""Aire"". Enjoy every note, every cord, every scream as well as the applauses; for ""Mecano en Concierto"" is a MUST."
3,thought-provoking,"Is this for real? I have read much from this author and to be honest I am not sure if he is being literal or metaphorical at times. Nor am I sure he really means some of what he is saying. The concept of the extreme individual is appealing to some extent, but quite lonely as well. At points, it seems that self-interest is secondary to just plain destruction for its own sake. Not his best book."
2,What is the big deal?,I had always heard and read about this great book. I read it and it was very very hard to get through it. I could barely read it. It was basically a stream of consciousness rambling. I just don't get all the glowing reviews. Maybe because of the style I did not get it. Maybe because it was the beat generation which I was not a part of. If you want a good travel book--read Steinbeck Adventures with Charlie.
2,Ehhh,"I hate reading the long reviews... If I want to know what a books about I can find it ABOVE all the reviews... Sooo... This book was alright. Not very exciting. Mostly plotless, in my opinion. They drive to the west where they attempt to seduce women, drink, and smoke. Then they drive to the east where they do the same thing. Then they head on down to Mexico where they do the same thing yet again. I don't understand all the hype...? The book is a bit pretentious. I prefer The Catcher in the Rye or Into the Wild to this."
3,book,I only bought this book that I have not recieved yet because an actor I like will be in the film...I wanted to read the characters parts...
2,"Tisk, tisk, tisk....","I am truly disappointed in this work. The book is a clumsy read at best. The first third of the book is especially gruelling and un-interesting. I can understand the ""live for the moment"" attitude and the need to experience life, but this is all really a tired act. Kerouac's characters do not grow from their experiences nor do they offer anything more than pseudo-intellectual insight into their world. It is even more painful that so many people term this ""the greatest book I have ever read"" or ""the greatest novel of the 20th century"". I would venture to say that not only is it neither, it is not even the best American novel of the 20th century. Steinbeck wrote with much more passion and color and Salinger captured the purity and innocence of youth more capably. I have given this book two stars, one for being definitive product of a misguided philosophy and one out of pity."
3,"It's a little out there, man.","Growing up in the 60's & coming of age in the 70's, I was curious about what spawned the hippie movement. Having heard controversial reviews about this book, I bought it in the hope that it could shed some light on the so-called ""Beat Generation."" I suppose it did that to a degree. Kerouac's writing is very colorful and allows one to paint a picture in one's mind. Maybe I'm just too young to fully appreciate this work. I found the story line to be a bit tragic and quite abstract. It left me with more questions about the ""Beat Generation"" than before I read the book."
1,On the Road by Jack Kerouac,"I swear this book was so dumb. I couldn't bear reading it any more after the first two chapters. The whole thing is written as what seems to me as an unfinished thought. I've heard that this was supposed to be a documentary item of an adventure but to me it was more like the ramblings of a doped up poet wannabe.Jack Kerouac wrote this book, or so I've heard, on one continuous roll of paper. It seems to me that there may be some truth in that because there is no end, just run-ons. I forced myself to read the rest of it, hoping that maybe it would get better. But alas, it (was ver bad). What is worse is the ending let me down even more.The whole story is about Sal Paradise, yes that is really his name, and how Sal hitchhikes back and forth the continental U.S. meeting up with his poet friends. See Sal. See Sal run. Run Sal, run. This is the basic jist of the whole book.I hope I make you think about reading this book. It's not for everyone. So, later."
4,Read This,This is an epic novel dipicting the negative aspects of a life on the road. Kerouac does a great job showing the hardships the main character Sal Paradise has to endure while trying to discover his identity while on the road with the careless Dean Moriarty. A story for intellectual minds.
1,nothing worse than naked hippie?,"Got this book for 1 buck in a 2nd hand - still regreting it. To be fair, I havn't finished it since 2 years as it just bored me - so maybe there are great parts at the end of the book. as far as I made it it sucked. Maybe it was nice in the old times but its lame now. Better off with Naked Lunch or Fear and Loathing if it comes to Beat literature."
4,Worth a second look after life's made you beat,"Bought my copy at City Lights bookstore in San Francisco during a cross-country road trip in 1997. Couldn't get into the novel. Very scattershot, I felt then, and while far more readable than Burroughs found myself wondering if this had any point.Cut to 2002, summer. I pick up my yellowing copy which I've for some reason kept. I begin again, reading in the morning while guzzling coffee and waiting for caffeine/inspiration to come and lift me up. I am so taken by Kerouac's journey I underline phrases.And I realize On The Road is not a novel so much as a long-form poem in the style of Walt Whitman. Read it as such. It speaks to anyone who's lost the first blush of youth, feels everyday 9-to-5 Life is not just a drag but Purgatory, loves the America to be found between here and there, insanity, gone little ladies, and who fights the Beat fight to be childlike and pure when cynicism is the new Hip."
1,Paragraph 4,"Chip had left on a whim, found himself coasting down big new highways in stolen cars with large, fully erect ideas about freedom and the open road and the infinite wisdom that is gained through the headlong assault of life. Mildly poetic standards that so worn and distant can only sustain a short trajectory in the modern era before ending their inheritors in a lost wagon talking nonsense to nobodies.infinitykid[dot]com"
1,I don't get it...,"I absolutely hated this book and virtually every character in it. My whole book club, made up of women in their 50's, hated it. I can't imagine how it's become a classic; my only thought is that it's gotten that reputation after being read and reviewed by drunken, drug-crazed fraternity boys. There isn't a likeable character in the whole bunch. Dean, the one everyone seems so drawn to, is clearly manic, possibly even psychotic. Even though I skipped whole sections, what I did read was a horrible waste of my time; I never would have read as much as I did had it not been for the book club."
3,"Great book, mediocre reading","On The Road is a masterpiece, but this reading is disappointing, particularly in the rendering of Dean (who sounds like Howlin' Wolf on Valium.) Comparison of this recording with Kerouac's own reading of sections of On The Road highlights Matt Dillon's shortcomings and makes you wonder if he did any homework (i.e., listened to any of Kerouac's recordings) before stepping up to the microphone."
2,not for me,"I have never liked this book. I've read it three times, two of which were for class, and I think I actually like it less every time I read it. I find the content interesting, but the writing style just does not appeal to me. I certainly appreciate Kerouac's originality in terms of style, but I don't personally enjoy it. It annoys me the way that it rambles on and on. The beginning of the novel rambles and moves slow, but by the end the story just abruptly finishes. I just don't find it enjoyable to read."
1,most overated book ever??,"I just don't understand it. How is this book a classic? I can sum the whole story up in a couple of sentences...Drove fast to a new town,drank and chased women,drove fast to a new town,drank and chased women...over and over and over again. This is one of the most shallow, hollow books that I have ever read. If You want to read a real classic try The fountainhead by Ayn Rand or The Godfile by an underated ,talented new writer Frank Turner Hollon but please, for your own good, stay away from this."
4,"Exciting, yet... Oddly Boring.","This book has come into my hands twice now, and I still had difficulty finishing it. It tells of the ""Beat"" generation (I think ""Beat"" is short for ""Beatific"", which makes sense since Kerouac described the movement as essentially religious and himself as a ""strange sort of Catholic mystic""). Despite the exciting story, I found it to be oddly boring. Kerouac just kept going and going and going.... Regardless, there are many sublime points in his prose. The book is a great peace of ""Americana"". Enjoy."
2,Beat Style Tedious and Without Purpose,"This novel is interesting, but I found the style to be tedious and unsophisticated to no real end. While many may enjoy the romanticism of the life of these vagabond writers, I find the beat philosophy--both literary and personal--amazingly misguided. Rebellion against society, especially one as oppressive as 1950s America, is noble, but it must be marked by some true insight. The Beat rebellion, I believe, is summed up by the anecdote that Keruoac refused to wear a tie and jacket to his readings. Clothes do not a movement make, and this is certainly no real rebellion."
5,Art lives beyond its creator,"Okay, so the Beats were jerks. I know I wouldn`t have gotten along with them. I find their parasitic lifestyles disgusting. They are spiritual godfathers to all the droves of pasty-faced teens lounging and panhandling in places like Boulder and Seattle. I lead a rootless life myself and I don`t enjoy having to deal with the negative image of travellers that people like Kerouac have created.But that doesn`t matter.Because whatever I think of Kerouac personally, he created a novel of such energy and wild honesty that I always emerge from it with a freshness of spirit and passion. I have read no one, NO ONE, who better communicates the pain and joy of being a modern American nomad. Reading ""On the Road"" is like injecting Kerouac`s mind straight into my veins. And what an intense, confused, powerful, repugnant, wonderful mind it was. May he (finally) rest in peace."
2,Not all that its cracked up to be,The story is an impressive one of a man crossing the country many times. And not only crossing the country but really exploring it. It is inspiring but lacks any substantive emotion. You never develop a true connection with the characters possibly Dean at the best. The book is really a hundred page story stretched into a 300 page novel.
3,should come with bowl of popcorn,I feel the book Shiloh was a captivating portrayal of a dog who was beaten severely by a guy with big boots. The dog then fell in love with some kid.
1,Overrated and overhyped,"After reading this book twice, I still have no clue as to why it is still being hailed as the ""beatnik"" generation bible. I mean, puh-leaze..... if I want to read about a bunch of idiotic, hormonal men driving around in a primitive attempt to get laid, I'll just stop by the fraternity house. This is proof that men who dream of getting laid read about other men who dream about getting laid, and then praise them for being so gosh darn smart. What a waste of money... it does however make good toilet paper."
1,Drivel driven by more drivel,"This book was almost impossible to read. Not really sure how this is such a classic. Did not get through this book (gave up after 50 or 75 pages with nothing go on that was worth my time). So many good books to read, but this is not one of them. Drivel, drivel, and more drivel. Not really literature. But guess what, my opinion won't do anything to change people's minds, so whatever!"
2,Suffers from its own reputation,"Before you read this book you have heard about it. You know that Kerouac wrote it all in one sitting, that he used a typewriter with one long sheet so he didn't have to change pages, that Kerouac was a hip cat and a tragic figure all in once, that the guy he's writing about later traveled with Ken Kesey. You know that this book changed lives. You know that this book epitomized the beat movement along with Howl and (with qualifications) Naked Lunch.That's the problem. It's not a horrible book. In fact there are some great passages, but after all that hype it can't live up to its reputation. Mostly it's Kerouac trying to follow Cassidy around country and getting lost. Much of it is forgettable when you are reading it. While the book doesn't drag, it doesn't seem to go anywhere either.Try to read it with an open mind. You might enjoy it or you might hate it, but try to ignore the hype."
5,You oughta be ashamed!,"You oughta be ashamed if you're a blues guitar fan and don't have this in your collection. Simply put, one of the greatest live blues CDs I've ever heard. Roy's guitar is mesmerizing, with great backing from his band, and the wonderful ooze from the Hammond organ adds great soul and depth. The highlight is Roy's Bluz followed by the R&B flavored Can I Change My Mind & I'm A Ram. A winning trifecta! Hell, it's all good! Good vocals too, even the 2 by Roy himself."
1,One town is just like another.,"From the description of this book I thought it would tell historical incidents of Arkansas' small towns. Wrong. In this book, each town has a version of the same stereotypical characters: farmer and his wife in their kitchy style house, owner of the general store/gas station, etc. Dull. Dull. Dull."
5,Great movie !,It's a happy feeling Movie ! I have seen it a few times am so happy to own it. Love the old musicals.
2,Slow,"I like the old George Thorogood. Although this is not bad, it's not great. Love Doctor is my favorite song on the CD. It has the pazzaz of the George Thorogood of yesteryear."
1,Not a good thing,"This was the Bloodhound Gang's first CD. It was not very good. Actaully, I did'nt like one track on it. The only good part was the track where they made fun of Axel Rose who is one of my favorite rockers, but it was funny. That is what the one star is for. Otherwise the rest of the album is weak. If you want to hear a great Bloodhound Gang CD, get ""One Fierce Beer Coaster"", it is great. It shows how a group can improve from a lousy album"
3,decent quality for the price but could be better.,"its an over all good lock box for the price but it could be a lot better ill list the pros and cons,Pros: cheap price,lots of room for plenty of screwdrivers and prybars, very sturdy.Cons: locking mechacnism could be better seems cheap, holes not wide enough for larger prybars i had to widen one for my 36"" prybar, not completely universal unless your willing to drill holes in your box to mount, there is no hanger lip on top to actualy just hang off box you must be willing to drill holes and bolt holder on to your box."
5,Prothane 7-511-BL Black Lower Engine Torque Strut Chevy Cavalier,"Part arrived on time, and is of very high quality. This part was an exact fit, although it looks physically different from original. This part was installed in less than 20 minutes with only a 15mm socket."
2,I took it back.,"Timothy B. Smith has two excellent books in ""Champion Hill"" and ""This Great Battlefield of Shiloh"". I have both, learned from and enjoyed reading them. One is a tactical study and the other is a history of the development of a National Military Park. This book is a collection of essays on a central theme but hardly belong together. One essay is excerpts from the dedication speeches; another is about the Shiloh myths. The myths one is so basic that it would be fair paper for a Jr. High School student. At $34, this book is over priced and you would do well to buy something else."
3,not a picture book,"You are probably not purchasing this book unless you have read Desert Queen, the biography of Gertrude Bell. Because she was a photographer, in addition to her many other talents, I mistakenly assumed this was a photographic book. Instead, it is her fascinating first hand account of her love affair with Persia. An educated woman and a keen observer; read this book if you are looking for an in depth, personal understanding of the Middle east in the early 1900's."
5,Voice like an angel.,"Absolutely beautiful voice. Very accomplished artist who sings in multiple languages. Sounds great. Many varied songs, some favorites (amazing grace), some not heard often.I heard this woman sing on the internet and had to get a CD to listen to that voice on an audiophile system. Amazing!"
4,Everyone has a voice.,"I am the adopted mother of a 6 year old girl adopted at birth. I have always enjoyed reading books about adoption from everyones perspective. And this has everyones story. All ages, birthparents, adoptees, grandparents and adoptive parents.I like to read about adoption because it is our families reality. Unless you have been thru it and up close it is hard to understand. I feel like I am reading a foreign language for my family. Very positive and real stories. People not afraid to pointout the negative or the challenging aspects of adoption. All told with love. I gave it 4 stars because it is VERY religous. I am not against this but I was not necessarily looking for it. Those who do not have the religous beliefs of the authors may be put off."
5,LOVERBOY ON DVD!!!,"This movie is an halirious comedy of the 80s. Its about a guy(Patrick Dempsey, who has a girlfriend and he gets a job as a pizza delivery guy, the only thing is that the deliveries he makes arent just a pizza its a little fun with the opposite sex. The movie is halirious, he ends up even making a delivery to his mom(ALMOST). Colombia/Tristar pictures needs to bring this back on DVD!!! We should beg Colombia/Tristar pictures to bring this back, private resort, and just one of the guys, all on DVD. They need to be put on DVD, for us 80's fans."
2,meh.,"it's a shame.but, hey, it's the 'logical progession' theory in affect.ToD's been getting better every release, this is the first where they don't. sadly, the lack of Neil Busch seems to have made the band think that they're some sort of prog-rawk band...it's sad that this band, esp. after ST&C;'s would release something so...bland and seemingly uninspired."
5,BEST CD BY OZZY - RANDY RHOADS WAS A1,"INSTEAD OF HIS ""GREATEST HITS"" GET THIS LIVE RECORDING JUST FOR RANDY RHOADS GREAT PERFORMANCE. INCLUDES EVERY GREAT SONG EXCEPT ""OVER THE MOUNTAIN"" WHICH IS NOT ON THE GREATEST HITS CD EITHER!? STILL 5 STARS."
5,Where's the Revelation?,"First off this is a great CD. Anybody who loves great guitar playing, especially great LIVE guitar playing, will love this album. Randy Rhoads was a really great guitar player that had a big impact on 80's guitar playing and that whole shredder attitude. The soloing on all the songs are exceptional, highlights including:Crazy Train, Mr.Crowley, and Suicide Solution with one of the most memorable unaccompanied guitar solos ever. But after scanning the other reviews, I saw very little comments about Revelation Mother Earth. This is one of the best songs on the album and the solo is damn great! The only downer is the Dee outtakes which are just boring until he really gets to some playing. But this is a great CD for some great Randy Rhoads, some great Ozzy vocals, and early 80's hard rock at its best."
5,the greatest at his best,"Recently Rolling Stone rated the top 100 guitar players in history. In the 2 slot, behind Hendrix was Duane Allman with a comment buried in the text to the effect that even if he had not formed the ABB he would still be one of the greatest players just on the strength of his work at Muscle Shoals. This volume benefits from making much of that session work available in one place. Songs like Hey Jude, The Road of Love, Livin' on the Open Road and Down Along the Cove show Brother Duane redefining the role of slide guitar in rock music. Add classics like Loan Me A Dime, Please Be With Me, Going Down Slow, and the B.B. King Medley and you have a real treat.While a box set is long overdue, especially to focus on the work as a sideman, this will have to do till then"
3,Damage with a CD-box,"The product (double CD) was good, but the package left room for damaging the plastic cover of the CD-box. Another firm did it better and made the package full of paper, so there was no damage possible."
4,Next in the superb Ojibwe saga & it's mighty fine reading,"Oh boy, oh boy, Erdrich is out with a new one: Four Souls and it's a mighty fine read. This one focusses on Fleur Pillager and it's sly, witty and graceful as well as a bit of a thriller. I wonder about that surname, Pillager. Fluer isn't particularly easy to like and don't think Erdrich meant her to be -- which makes her AND the novel all the more interesting. Interesting trivia bit: it's shorter than usual for Erdrich; I haven't decided yet if that's good or not. Fortunately I don't have to as there will be another along soon, thank goodness."
1,Worst product ever,[...] It is terrible. The clock is always wrong (runs fast). Reception and sound is horrible. Jensen should issue all of us a new and better model instead of pushing these with rebates and sales. [...]
4,Small and easy to operate,"The directions are clear and easy to follow. I've never used a digital camera before, the memory card plugs right into my computer with no need for cables, its great."
2,Worked beautifully for 2 years,"Bought my camera in November 2005. For 2 years, it took great pictures indoors (and outdoors in good light) Evreyone loved its sleek construction. Last month...the zoom lever completely jammed, and the mode selector is also nearly jammed...completely disappointing, and what was worse was the price quote from Canon to repair (good customer service in calling to report the problem...emailed the link to me immediately and got back to me with the price quote quickly after I shipped it to them) but the price quote - 130$! I can get the new sd1000 for 166 (today, hopefully less on black friday) not sure if this is a flaw that others experienced, but the camera worked very well during the 2 years I had it. Looking at the SD1000 now, only because it was reviewed very well...but I hope it doesnt die in 2 years as well!"
5,Unbelievable,The picture quality is astounding for how tiny it is. Everything about it is amazing. The only thing I'm worried about is losing it or sliding out of my pocket because its so small. I had an much older Digital ELPH with 2.1 Megapixels and this thing blows it out of the water. I don't see how they could improve on it.I definitely reccomend buying a big memory card. I got a 1GB (for $85) and you can take long movies and 500+ 7.1MP pics on it.
5,Excellent Speakers,"I bought these primarily for watching DVDs on my PC and they haven't dissapointed me. These are excellent speakers, and the subwoofer is great. They provide an excellent 3-D effect. The subwoofer has a separate volume control---- perfect for when you want to adjust how much the room will shake as you watch a movie. The only problem this set has is that it doesn't have a jack where you can plug in your headphones. Oh well. I solved that by buying a small extension cable, so I don't have to reach behind my desk to plug the headphones directly.Bottom line: these are great for movies, games, music--- and they won't ruin your budget."
5,These books arfe the best books I've ever read,These books are the most powerful books that I have ever read. I would recomend this ste of books to anyone who enjoys reading about the south and slavory. The storys are about the Logan family and how they survived in those hard times.
4,Lovely book and well written,I loved to read this book. It was well written and tells a heartbreaking story. The innocents of a black young girl who doesn't understand why she is treated so different then the white kids. I almost felt sorry it had to be explainded to her. I wish we didn't have to tell our chideren that there is a difference between black and white.
4,"Disincarnate : ""Dreams Of The Carrion Kind""","This is excellent old-school Death Metal. Nothing really groundbreaking, but if you enjoy bands like Obituary / Death / Malevolent Creation / Massacre / Cancer / Carnage / or any old-school Death Metal for that matter, you will enjoy this....J. Murphy has become one of Death Metal's pioneers, and his message here on ""Dreams Of The Carrion Kind"" is clear. Death Metal is here to stay..."
1,not good service,"This item was ordered for my son for Christmas, which we had away from home at my son's grandmother's house. When wrist communicators came, we tried to charge the batteries. One of them charged just fine, and the other did not charge at all. We switched communicators, and found that the good battery worked in both and the bad battery worked in neither. Since we were away for Christmas, we called the company, were on hold for 20 minutes, then told them the problem and that we needed a new battery sent to our home address. They took down the address and said they would send it. When we returned home from our trip, no battery had arrived. The company then left a number on my mother's voice mail (where we were for Christmas,) and said they needed info on where to send the battery. She called and told me about the message, and I called the company again, and after a half hour on hold, I hung up. I have decided to return the item to Amazon, and buy my son something else to replace it."
1,OLD VERSION - DO NOT BUY,I bought this program during summer of 2012 and could not load it on my Macbook Pro due to compatibility issues. Amazon.com should not advertise MAC compatibility for this old software.DO NOT BUY.
2,poor sound,"We've been very pleased with the original JumpStart products. My 4 year old has a fascination with learning Spanish so we purchased this program. We both find the words extremely difficult to understand. It's like the sound is being muffled somehow. Our hardware is top rate so it is definitely a problem in the software's sound quality. The format is good, you just can't understand what they're saying clearly enough to repeat the words."
2,Too much background music,"I am not impressed with Jumpstart Spanish. My biggest concern is that there is constant loud background music in almost all features of the game that apparently cannot be turned off. The music is inoffensive, but it makes it very hard to hear the Spanish. Turning up the volume only turns all of it up, so the whole game ends up being too loud for our small house, and still my daughters can't quite make out what they are saying.My other concern is more a matter of personal taste - the whole scenario is surreal. A rabbit goes into a tree and then enters rooms in a dollhouse. I guess this wouldn't bother most young children but somehow the animation seems just slightly off to me - a little dark, or strange, or something. Not bad or spooky, just odd. I have never seen other Jumpstart products, so I cannot compare it in that respect."
1,Don't Buy if you're using 64-Bit Windows,No product support whatsoever. I looked and looked online to find a solution to my problem. This program uses Quicktime 32-bit and will not recognize 64-bit versions. There is no patch available to make this work either. I found tech support non-existent and online support lacking. I'll not buy from this maker again.
1,False Advertising,You get a different version then the one in the picture and it is old. It would not run on either our mac or our PC. The application it said was no longer supported. Do not buy. We need to complain to amazon that this person is switching out the product with an older version. This is outrageous!
3,Major Design Flaw,"The product works great, it even looks great. I really like that it allows me store the controllers in one compact location. However, there is the major design flaw that everyone mentions: It is Very difficult to seat the controllers USB recactacle port onto the chrgers USB plug!!! I am very patient and gentle with the thing, but it takes me at least a good 1-2 minutes to get it to seat properly. I have already damaged the port on one controller. I design electronic products for a living, they could have easily made this product better with very little added expense."
2,2 Stars for Peter Gabriel and Deep Forest!,"Listen, I am not really pumped up about the entire CD, but there are only two reasons to purchase it and that's - PETER GABRIEL/DEEP FOREST - While the Earth Sleeps! What ever Peter Gabriel blesses with his voice, magic happens......."
2,Clapton at his most tired.,"I bought this album in the cut-out bin of my local record store way back. Although I am not sure, I don't think Eric played that much guitar. Most of the work was done by George Terry. I recall that Clapton's lack of interest in playing the guitar was a frequent complaint from concert goers at the time."
5,Clapton's Best Live Album,"I have had this album since it came out in 1975. Not only is this his best live album, but also so my favorite Clapton album ever. Definitive Blues-Rock."
1,Pretty sad,"Dont be fooled by the Osbourne money making machine, this half-assed reissue has nothing to do with giving fans a better version of a classic album, it has to do with screwing Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake out of royalties that are rightfully theirs. I honestly dont know what the hell is happening to Ozzy these days. Ever since ""The Osbournes"" he's been gaining legions of fairweather fans, alienating true fans and now screwing musicians over too! Its sad and pathetic. These people are rich as hell, but they're still so damn greedy that their own money isnt enough, they want Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake's money too?? I wont help $haron or O$$y with their cynical schemes, and I ask that you dont either. Dont let The Osbournes make a sucker out of you with this disgraceful CD. Stick with the original, it sounds better anyway."
1,BEWARE!!! THIS RECORD IS A FRAUD...,"This is a ""remastered"" version of the original in which they (Ozzy and Sharon) have removed the work of bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake, whose playing was (and remains) so instrumental to the success of these records. This was done out of spite and is so sick as to be almost beyond belief. If these records ever meant anything to you - and if they still do - DO NOT BUY THESE REMASTERS!!!!!"
1,How to ruin a classic? Just add greed!,I would hate to ever be so petty as to ruin a classic album just to avoid paying someone. Nice job Sharon!
1,Ozzy & Sharon Prove Their Lack of Integrity.,"Seriously.... This is a cheap re-issue without Bob Daisley & Lee Kerslake. Even worse, Daisley wrote almost all of the lyrics on Blizzard and Diary. I have pledged, never again will I spend so much as a penny on anything Osbourne related. Boycott the re-issues. If I want any of the non-fake Ozzy albums, I will buy them used. This reissue is about as cool as an AOL CD.Ozzy, while having a bit of talent back in the day, is now as commercial as Britney Spears. Most anything he has done lately is written by hired songwriters, his band is basically a bunch of hired goons. This is coming from a guy who used to talk about how great Ozzy is, as with the other 50 or so ""boycott this garbage"" reviews here. These re-issues are the nails in Ozzy coffin, and effectively demonstrate his (and Sharon's) lack of respect for his/their own legacy. I'm disgusted.Shame on you Ozzy.Shame on you Sharon."
4,"Classic Ozzy, but not his best composium.","I would give this record a 5 star review, other than the fact that the songs just don't fit together. They are all good songs, some of his best, but the way they were compiled could have been a lot better. Say, by putting on another 1 or 2 faster songs and not ending with the song ""Diary of a Madman""."
2,"I am sorry, but I had to see for myself","I bought it even though you all warned me. Let me be brief.I can forgive the missed drumbeat during Randys solo in ""Over the Mountain"". I can forgive the off-time bass and drums in ""Flying High Again"". But I cannot forgive Mr. Trujillo for adding his own bass lines to the beginning of ""You Can't Kill Rock and Roll"", how dare he think he can improve the playing on that song. Bob Daisley never overplayed anything unless it fit the song well. I cringe when I hear those bass notes he decided to add to that song. ...The cd does sound great. Let's just put it back with the ORIGINAL musicians. HELLO???"
2,Half-Assed follow-up to a Classic,"I can't believe all the Reviewers who enjoy this album, cuz Personally I find this album to be Dull Sounding compared to Ozzy's legendary debut.""Diary of a madman"" sounds VERY rushed. The band was trying so hard to meet that deadline before the tour kicked off. And from listening it Becomes painfully obvious.I pull ""Diary of a Madman"" off the shelf for only 3 songs: ""Flying High Again' and ""Over the Mountain"", which is a BLATANT Re-Hash of ""I Don't know"". The title track is good, Randy played a fine intro. The Rest of the songs are Un-Interesting Filler.Don't get me wrong y'all, I love Ozzy, but I wasn't feeling ""Diary of a madman"".Sadly, This was Randy Rhoads last recording before his untimely death, A mediocre set of songs to end a Brief and Amazing life.Fortunately enough Ozzy redeemed himself with Guitar whiz Jake E. Lee (who in my humble opinion is better than Rhoads.) and returned to form with albums like ""Bark at the moon"" and ""The Ultimate Sin""."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,I saw Ozzy on both his Blizzard of Oz tour and his Diary of a Madman tour. I bought both albums when they were brand new. The biggest mistake Ozzy made in his solo career was getting ride of Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake. That was until Sharon and he made these awful remasters. Go to a record store and buy used copies of the originals. It is amazing what greed can do to rich people. Ozzy should be ashamed of this. It was bad enough when he (and Sharon) put pictures of his new band on the original album sleve but to not even put the real music on the cd reisue is a bad joke. This is a 5 star ripoff of a great album. And I mean 5 star in a very bad way.
5,"yes,....this is much better than Blizzard of Ozz.......period.","i know many of you rockers, as with most of my own buddies, think Blizz' is a better release than Diary, but your only kidding yourself. first off, the engineering and recording of this one is superior to that of Blizz'. second, the musicianship far exceeds that of Blizz'. thirdly, listen to the solos in these tunes. Rhoads outdoes himself on this album (over the mtn., believer are a couple of examples). still not convinced? ok, listen to the lyrics. much more polished and refined than what Blizz' offers up. and, of course, Ozzy himself. his singing is much smoother and balanced on Diary, maybe due to the better engineering, but still an upgrade from Blizz'. in my opinion, a much better listen. i have all of the Ozz man's offerings, and yes, i love Blizzard as well, but i feel Diary has always been the ugly step sister to Blizz'. are you convinced now? i didn't think so. neither are my buddies. peace."
5,Excellent heavy metal record,"You will not be disappointed with this album. Ozzy does his usual excellent job vocally and the guitar riffs are out of this world. Just listen to any song and you will be blown away by the guitar work here, it simply just doesn't get any better. So just do yourself a favor and enjoy the pure heavy metal bliss, keep rocking metal heads!!"
4,An Outline of the History of Neighborhood Organizing,"Fisher provides a detailed outline of the major trends in neighborhood organizing in the United States from the early 20th century to the present. He does a good job in linking social conditions to organizing strategies and tactics. The book gives the reader a sense of the progression of ideological movements in the United States over time. It is very inclusive as it covers organizing among the white working and middle classes and African Americans. It also touches on gender issues and issues of sexual orientation. It is inclusive in another way in that it covers different organizing approaches such conflict organizing as opposed to consensus-building; and locality development, social planning and social action. Fisher concludes with ""lessons"" learned from history to strengthen community practice in the present and the future."
1,Funny? I missed something.,"I had this book on my shelf for the longest time, meaning to read it, because I like a lot of Steinbeck's books and because when I was a child my family used to go to a campground in Arizona called ""Tortilla Flat."" So I finally sat down with the book and started reading it. Not only was I more and more annoyed the more I read it, but I realized I had actually read it before and hadn't found it one bit memorable. Irresponsibility, constant drinking, and skirt-chasing just don't seem funny to me. I didn't bother to finish it, nor did I give it to someone who might like it better--it went out with the trash.Steinbeck was probably good and drunk when he wrote this pointless book, but you're far better off reading East of Eden, The Pearl, or even Grapes of Wrath (which must be one of the most depressing books ever written)."
4,"Steinbeck, Like Wine, Gets Better with Age","I enjoyed returning to Steinbeck after a hiatus starting in early high school. I forgot how easily his prose is consumed, and ""Tortilla Flat"" is a book to gorge on--to guzzle down the way Danny takes his wine. In ""Tortilla Flat,"" too, is a wit I don't remember in school requirements like ""The Pearl."" Here, Steinbeck's ironic tone and character-building dialect reminds of Mark Twain, with Twain's cynicism to boot.See my full-length reviews on my book blog LitBeetle.com"
5,So engrossing that I have always felt drawn into the life and times of Danny and the Boys of Tortilla Flat,Tortilla Flat is a bedside book that I can pick up and read passages over and over while forming verbal visions of the characters and scenes. It makes me feel comfortable.
1,they made me put at least 1 star--it should be 0,"i just finished the book. after i write this two sentence review, i plan on committing suicide."
5,...as opposed to a tortilla that's not flat?!?!,"This book is just great, silly title notwithstanding.Compelling characters that drink and smoke and swear and fight and womanize (sounds like some guys I know!)! Does it get any better.If you liked this book and are looking for similar things to read, don't get suckered into reading The Tortilla Curtain. It is VERY different. It is a sad tale of America's oppression of the Spaniards."
4,"Brilliant, but slow","Steinbeck's novel is extreemly clever. It is very funny, with a sharp satirical edge. However the plot is very slow moveing. It is, however, enjoyable simply to follow the adventures of the colourful characters and apreciate the rich language."
3,I think Twenty and Ten is Realistic,"Twenty adn Ten is a very detailed story with many interesting facts. I belive many of these facts happened in the time period of World War II. I think it is detailed because the author takes alot of time to explain the main events. I have read several facts that have made me contemplate that the novel is realistic. The fist example of the author's factual style is when Sister Gabriel was sent to prison. She was sent to jail because the Nazis thought she was hiding Jewish children, which she was. I belive that people would have done this during World War II. Secondly, the townspeople hid Jews in a cave from the Nazis. It seem to me honest people would have protected jews during this historical period. Lastly the author writes about the children's ration card. I know that children during the Holocaust had ration cards."
2,Poorly produced.,"With the exception of the last track (Dry), I'm dissappointed with this. It sounds as though it was thrown together in a couple of days. Tracks 5 and 6 even have their titles switched. Even if you are a hardcore PJ Harvey fan, I recommend giving this one a miss."
3,Alright,"This album is not that bad but certainly not Ozzy's best, with more of an ""80's metal"" feel. ""miracle man,"" which is about Jimmy Swaggart and ""tattoed dancer"" are the best songs on this album in my opinion. ""Demon alcohol"" and ""bloodbath in paradise' are also good. Some songs get repitive though. Get this if you are a fan."
2,Suddenly lost,"Ozzy lost a little here. The drums are much flat, Zakk's guitar is sometimes unhearable (very low). the sound is murky and emotionless. Of course, we have here the Ozzy's quality in compositions. The bottom line: the material is good, but the production flawed."
2,Nothing here I would record,"Ozzie is one of the best, but this album does not show him at his best. No More Tears was much better."
4,Ozzy's Most Underrated.,"No Rest For the Wicked has to be one of the most underrated albums in metal. After Randy Rhoades death, he was replaced by Jake E Lee but he left the band also. Zack Wylde was the new guitarist and Ozzy took a new direction, however this was before his comeback with No More Tears that put him back into the limelight. No Rest For the Wicked is the heaviest of his '80s discography. It's also very fast paced and upbeat, in my opinion Zack Wylde's a lot better guitarist than Jake E Lee or even Randy Rhoades. No Rest For The Wicked was almost forgotten and it only had one minor hit, ""Miracle Man"". ""Demon Alcohol"" and ""Tattooed Dancer"" are my personal favorites. It's not my absolute favorite or probably not even in my top 5 but it's a step up from his last 2 albums and a good underrated gem, it's only a sign of things to come."
3,Are we done yet?,"I think this series has plodded along for too long already. I snatched this book right away, because I wanted to know what happened, but the story line just keeps dragging on. Now that someone else has come to take care of Belle Terre I think the Enterprise should be able to leave more easily.The best part of this book was not the plot, but the writing. It sounded like reading an old Western novel. Worth a try, but don't get too excited."
2,Bad Proofreading,"I would NOT recommend this version of the book. The actual story is excellent Christie, but this version has a lot of errors and most of the book ended up italicised-- very hard on the eyes. Definitely buy the book-- just not this version."
4,Day of the Dead,"I didn't think it came up to the quality of Jance's other books, particularly the Joanne Brady books, of which I'm very fond."
2,Please go back to Joanna Brady,"I have read all of Jance's Joanna Brady books and love them so I was admittedly a bit bummed to discover her new book was not of that series. However, I was still excited but this book just dragged on and on with way too much contrived sex crime stuff as well. What a downer compared to Jance's normal good work."
4,Low item price but high shipping price,"I'm very satisfied with the holster,it will last forever but I'm a bit put off with the shipping charge which was almost the same as the price of the item!"
3,Easy standard holster,Simple holster. Nothing much to it. Uncle Mike has other products that are better. I was looking for something that I could wear inside my waistband. Oh well.
2,Doesn't work for an N-frame Smith,"I bought this as just a place to put my S&W 629 3.5 inch when plinking in the woods, so I didn't have to set the gun on the ground (no fast draw or combat practice) when checking targets. This holster is just too tight to be practical for even a limited carry or storage, and it doesn't seem to be stretching after a month with the revolver holstered and snapped. It fits 4 inch K-frame Smiths, okay, but I think I'm going to have to spring for a custom leather holster for the 629. My fault for cheaping out. This might also work better for an automatic like a Glock or 1911, as it's the cylinder on the revolver that makes the holster too snug."
4,Very Good...For A Computer Sport Game,This game is a very good game. Its lots of fun and its realistic. The only problem is the AI is very difficult to beat!
4,Enjoyable,"Simply marvelously done. Love it! Songs with meaning and with love, able to reflect and embrace the words. Too bad he didn't have a song on there I heard him on youtube sing but nevertheless it;s a great CD."
5,Love This Soundtrack!,"I love this soundtrack. I blast it loud in the house and it rumbles. It's music, very subjective to review..."
3,Doesn't hold a candle to the Canadian recording,"Michael Crawford unfortunately originated the role of the Phantom, so his mold has come to be the accepted one. Crawford plays the Phantom without the ""bite"" of a Wilkinson or a Groenendaal. The Phantom isn't a sweet nice guy, and Crawford's lack of genuine emotion is glaringly obvious when listening to Colm Wilkinson's portrayal of the Phantom. Brightman does not due her role justice - she lacks the power in her range that a Rebecca Caine does not. Simply put, this is an OK recording, but the Canadian recording is head and shoulders above it."
5,My favorite CD,"I have almost 400 CDs of all types of music and I can easily say this is my favorite. Michael Crawford is awesome - his voice is haunting - the perfect phantom. It's a fantastic CD because it's one of those you can easily listen to from beginning to end - a true album. With this CD you just want to sit on your couch in a dark room and feel the music and emotion.I heard this CD and then went to the broadway show in NY and was unfortunately disappointed - after hearing Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, even though the show is still amazing, the performers in their place were a letdown.If you even suspect that you like contemporary opera, you will love this CD."
3,Thumbsucker,"This story takes place in Minnesota, during the Reagan era in the 1980's. It is the story of 16 year old Justin Cobb and his journey to find his place in this world, and in his family. Justin has an addictive personality and moves from thumbsucking through alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, speech team, Ritalin, fly-fishing, and Mormonism, all with great gusto. he quickly gives 100% to a particular addiction, only to find his satisfaction wane after awhile.Because this book is written in first-person, we are privy to Justin's thoughts on himself and other people in his life. This is an entertaining book, although there are graphic drug experiences and crude language (not the usual bad language used). There are several instances in this book where I just don't understand why Walter Kirn wrote what he wrote, (i.e. what happened when Justin and his friend went to get drugs). I would recommend it for a mature high school audience."
2,A big disappointment,"To echo some of the earlier reviews, this is a disappointingly slight novel from the author who created the captivating world of ""She Needed Me"". Kirn writes well, but this novel is surpisingly devoid of meaning. Vignette after vignette depict a depressingly stale Midwestern adolescence, with a broadly drawn protagonist and his vaguely drawn family. Justin Cobb has any number of adventures - his mother works at a Hazelton-like rehab clinic,where she may or may not be having an affair with a tv star in-patient, his speech coach has casual gay sex (point please?), his seldom seen grandparents appear and briefly, if unintentionally, kidnap Justin, and Justin has his first sexual experiences with a fellow Mormon convert. Some of these tales are well told, and keep the pages turning. But what's the point?I had to laugh at earlier reviews listing the novel's strength as it being a quick read. You know you're in trouble when that saves you from a bad review."
1,couldn't play it,after i ordered it I tried to cancel on your web-site.I could not find where to cancel the order...
1,Last of the dog men,The item I bought will not load into any DVD player. This is a great movie to bad I can't have it in my collectionFrank
1,a waste of my money,i do not believe that it was made clear that this could only be played i=on a DVD in Europe-it should have been stated this way. region 2 meant nothing to me-and there was no way to return it.
4,"I like the move, but never received the movie",I wrote several emails to the seller and amazon stating that I never received the product. I bought it in mid November as a Xmas present and now I dare to say it will never be received. The only answer I get is that it is lost in the mail. If someone could look into it and let me know I would appreciate it. T
3,Last of the Dogmen,"This is one of my favorite movies. Had to give $42. for it since it is no longer available. Seller for Amazon did not wrap it properly for mailing, jacket was somewhat damaged when received. Normally would not have cared but after giving that much money for a DVD I would have thought they could have secured it better to mail."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"WHEN I RECEIVED THIS CD, IT WOULD NOT PLAY ON MY CD PLAYER. THERE WAS A MESSAGE ON THE SCREEN THAT SAID I COULD NOT PLAY IT BECAUSE I HAD CHOSEN THE WRONG REGION. I WAS NEVER AWARE THAT YOU HAD TO CHOOSE A REGION. I THOUGHT THAT IF YOU WERE ORDERING FROM THE US THAT YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GET THE CD FOR THE CORRECT REGION."
2,"I was very disappointed with the VHS, I'm just glad I didn't pay anymore for it.","As I already said, I was very disappointed with the quality of the VHS. I realize you get just what you pay for something. Next time I will think twice before I order something that is used. The VHS did a lot of rolling in places, but we did manage to watch it. I found a DVD and it works fine."
5,Last of the Dogmen,"I'm not one to watch many movies, let alone watch them more than once. This is an exception. The scenery is awesome and the story line always intrigues me."
1,Region 2 ??,"I ordered this DVD thinking it was a movie. I wish I would of noticed that it said ""Region 2."" I don't know what that means but I put the DVD in my DVD player and it said that I didn't have access to play it. I will be sending it back. I wanted the movie, not sure what I got. I now know it has something to do with the ""Region 2"" indication on it, but I don't know what that means. Could someone tell me? Thanks."
1,wasnot able to receive,"for some reason it was cancelled by amazon,,, and didnot receive,, was looking forward to watching it as i heard it was a good movie"
5,Miracle Product,I've been using this product for many months. My IBS-C is so much better! Taking Tummy Fiber doesn't make me nauseated like the medication my G.I. doctor prescribed for constipation. All my other symptoms of IBS are also better. I can't say enough great things about this product!
1,"Made me feel sluggish, dizzy and upset my colon","After just one day on this fiber my IBS was worse, I suffer from IBS-D and this made me go more, not less. It caused my BM's to worsen and burn. I do not recommend this product. I stopped for a few days and felt better and than I tried this product again and the problems came back."
1,People Coming to Jesus!,"You know if this revival were of the devil, he is doing a bad job because people are getting saved. At the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, people are getting saved every night and this has been the case every night for 6 years. Obviously the author was deceived if he thinks this is of the devil.This is a false impression of a true move of God. Then again they did the same thing to Jesus. Having been in Toronto and experienced the ""Fathers Blessing,"" I know the love of God as a Father. This was very disapointing as it was written to hurt and written without love. God loves you and his love isn't found in this book ."
2,"he is on the offensive against the ""pseudo-christian cults""","His material is helpful at times though he is a bit heavy handed in some of his critique. His predecessor, Dr. Walter Martin, seemed far more open to charismatic movements like the Toronto blessing, Zoo Annointing, Clicking, and other manifestations of the Charismatic renewal movement. I can't agree with Hank on everything but who can? This man is enlightened by 1st hand experience of Christian pentecostalism. His voice is one of authority."
3,Still relevant today,"Having experienced a local version of the Brownsville/Toronto experience many years ago I found this book to put into words what I had been feeling back then. After about 3 years of laughter, people falling down, and plenty of 'words of knowledge' not only was my community unaffected but all my church gained was an extra meeting full of emotional people.Hanegraff did a great job of exposing these types of 'awakenings' for what they are but a poor job of letting us know about his background or beliefs. What you end up with in this book is a lot of stories about other people and very little understanding of his own personal beliefs or theology about how the Holy Spirit operates today."
1,yellow journalism reigns,"This book is simply a personal diatribe against magnificent moves of God. It is poorly researched and the author is a dishonest writer. The Bible tells us (Isaiah 55) that God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts, that His ways are higher than our ways. The entire Bible is filled with events that most people would consider BOGUS and stupid and silly, and that is because HIS ways are higher than ours. We have no right to judge HIS ways! Please see Naaman--2 Kings 5. Jesus DYING on the cross in order to obtain victory for mankind is on the face of it preposterous! No one dies to win, after all....I am quite sure that Hank would have been in the crowd around Jesus telling him, ""IF you're so great, show us! Come down from that cross and really be a man like we expect you to be."" No, Hank is fearful of the mighty moves of God. And who is the author of fear?Please see this book for a truly biblical investigation into God's ways for us today:Surprised by the Power of the Spirit."
5,Finally - The best television series of all time out on DVD,"Glorious, glamourous, intriguing, touching and melodramatic - that's Dynasty for you. No television series was ever better or more beatifully set than Dynasty..."
5,Are we gonna wait forever ???,"Dynasty season 1 was release on DVD not too long after Dallas season 1. Dallas is up to season 4 now, and we are still waiting for Dynasty season 2 to be release. Come on FOX studios awake and gives us what we're waiting for !!!"
1,Do not buy this DVD!,"Get the boxset of seasons one and 2, its about $3 cheaper. Strange, but true...."
4,Can't wait!,"God, I'm hooked!!! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 2 SOON!!!! I can't bear to wait a moment longer!"
1,cannot rate didnot receive,Unfortuniatly the items that were deliverd I never received and I would like to know how to order from amazon with a signature required or hold at the post office.
2,Not Impressed,"This product is a great idea, but suffers in its execution. Perhaps these are all design problems that had to be addressed in the way they were, but I don't like the curvature of the tines, I find the fork too heavy and unbalanced (it has a tendency to slip off your plate if you leave it there), and I feel it's too thick at the neck, making it difficult to hold normally. It does cut better than a regular fork, but rarely gets used due to the above issues."
2,Hair band goes awry in Seattle,"Cryptic song titles, sludgey riffs, pained singing from thinly stretched vocals...it must be an Alice in Chains CD. Yep, that's the one.AIC don't bring their A-game to the table on this self-titled disaster, except for a few key tracks: ""Heaven Beside You"" and ""Again"" are true keepers, the rest of the record is deplorable. Sadly, the only good record these guys ever made was 1993's stellar ""Jar of Flies,"" an acoustic gem that broke AIC through to the big leagues of the music industry, where they always longed to be.Rumor has it these guys used to be a hair-band from the '80s. That's abundantly clear from this mess of a record album CD. For true rock, check out Creed 'n' Bush.THANKS A LOT FOR LISTENIN'!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Alice In Chains - self-titled (Columbia),"This was the band's third full-length release,as it may not be any better than 'Facelift' or 'Dirt'.But,at least the guys didn't wimp out.I remember hearing SO many negative replies about this disc because it appeared that vocalist Layne Staley(R.I.P.) had somewhat straightened out.Don't think the band toured right after the release of the CD,but I do recall seeing them open for Kiss a bit later,which for a opener,I thought they were decent.I liked the tunes ""Grind"",their 2nd single off the disc ""Heaven Inside You"",the ass-kicking ""Shame In You"" and ""So Close"" the best.Not a bad effort."
3,what happened?,"After listening to this album, I thought what happened to these guys. Facelift and dirt proved that they could make good hard rock albums and jar of flies proved that they could change to more of an acoustic album and still sound good. However, the songs on this album seem to lack the same emotional intensity that helped to make their first 3 albums good such as bleed the freak, we die you, rooster, i stay away and no excuses. There songs seem largely bland. There really is noting that keeps you want to listen to songs like grind, heaven beside you and brush away. Away is the only good songs on this album and even that is would be an average song on one of their previous albums. Save your money and don't buy this album."
3,"Good,but not great.","I like this cd,but for me it was too scattered is the only word I can think of.Heaven beside you is a beautiful song.I guess I just feel like the band really wasn't into this cd,as far as the song-writing goes.Grind is also one that stands out as a winner.Lotsa filler??Don't haterade me,but I think this is a weaker effort by AIC.That being said,heaven beside you,grind and again are classic AIC.But this cd is definitely worth buying!"
4,The need to be closer to Stanley,"I just did a review for ""Jar of Flies"" because this weekend I broke out the ""Singles"" CD to listen to ""Would"" and this morning I listened to the ""Jar of Flies"" tape, but over the weekend I cranked this CD up and had about a hour of good ole head banging... This one didn't have as many hits as some of the other CD's by this band but if you are a true ""AIC"" die-hard fan it is a MUST this was definately ""Stanley's"" CD IMO.I agree with what someone mentioned in a earlier review here, this CD is more to the first ""AIC"" CD's harder, angry tones there was something going on with the Band for sure. All in all get this CD it's good for head banging but if you really want to appreciate the ""whole"" of the Band get the earlier works as well.Peace and I'm out"
