4,Good Reliable Shoe,"I have ordered this style before i different colors. This is about my third pair. Is roomy, comfortable without being loose. I wouldn't wear it to walk in all day on concrete but perfect for the office and some standing/walking."
2,SPUTTERING TO A HALT,"The best track? Love Is A Mystery. They should have included that song in the previous CD, Carolina Dreams and called it quits. This CD is terrible! I can't begin to describe my disappointment on this CD after shelling out 7 bucks.What a waste! They should have stayed with the same forumula from their debut album to Carolina Dreams."
1,horrible shipping and old edition,"Despite expedite shipping being purchased, the book did not arrive for more than TWO weeks. Since it was a present, had to go to Barnes and Noble and buy another copy. Book was not edition shown in picture."
4,Good sound advice,Dr. Brazelton is so down to earth and really reminds you how important it is to be patient and understanding with your child. I think he has such a good grasp of what little ones need. This book is definitely great to have. It didn't have too much in it that I didn't already know but alot of good advice about how to handle everyday problems.
1,"Sorry, I cannot recommend this movie","Very unfortunately I found the St Rita movie to be quite a departure from my taste. It took me three days to watch because, in my opinion, it just wasn't believable. In my DVD the audio track often did not match the mouth movements of the actors. The script took such artistic license that I'm sorry to say it wasn't credible, and therefor often made the acting seem wooden. As another person's testimonial indicated, the actions of the St Rita character just don't seem realistic (ie from honourable to deranged and back). More than being a matter of only personal taste, I would like to have seen more of the saintly behaviour I've read about plus a little more historical accuracy, perhaps exploring the stigmata phenomena a little."
2,"Not a saint's life, but a fantasy of one","As a homage to one of the most beloved saints of the Augustinian order, this is a truly compelling and well-intentioned film. However, viewers who are new to Rita's story and those whose lives have been blessed by her favor should explore the information available at the National Shrine of Saint Rita in Philadelphia. Here, one can learn of latter-day research that not only rehabilitates the character of her husband but also makes a convincing case for her implausibly ""miraculous"" entry into the convent, to say nothing of its various depictions of her astonishing devotion to Christ's passion. Indeed, Rita's receipt of the stigmata from the crown of thorns--which takes up mere moments in the film--was the indisputable center of her many years in the convent and the origin of her progress to deserved sainthood. Instead of the wildly inflated and romantic tale offered by the film, Rita's real story is one marked by austerity, Good Suffering, and holy mystery."
1,Fiction with a dab of fact thrown in.,"I saw this movie on EWTN and was tempted to purchase it; however, I checked St. Rita's life story first. The REAL story would have been more encompassing. Imagine a twelve year-old girl being forced into a marriage, then overcoming death and mayhem, while keeping her faith, and finally being rewarded with Heaven's imprimatur. Now there is a story worth telling. What a noble soul! Smaltz is a poor way to portray her noble life.Frankly, when it comes to the lives of the Saints I am tired of being presented with seriously misleading drama. Shame on the so-called Catholic press who market the deceptions as they play fast and loose with the facts. No more DVD's on the lives of the Saints. I'll stick to reliable books. Thanks Amazon for giving us a choice. Save your money, unless you like to be deceived."
1,Twin Swords,"The film, ""Saint Rita"", was so far removed from her actual life story that to entitle a movie by her name is fraudulent. I won't reiterate the biographical data of Saint Rita's life, since other reviewers have adequately covered those facts. However, any half-educated person and knowledgeable Christian would give two thumbs down on this depiction of her life.May I suggest the title ""Twin Swords"" or something similar to denote the bloody nature of the film? Although the costumes/story line might be interesting to some, I could not finish watching the movie after the first hour because of the unauthentic following of her life story."
5,ok but we made it better,"We bought this easel for our son instead of the little tikes mission style easel which is [alot] more. It is ok but we made it better. The dry erase board is not a very good surface, when my son writes on it and then tries to erase, it won't erase. The only way the marker will come off is to use the spray, and I am not real eager to give my 4 year old something to spray himself in the eye with. Also it would be nice if it had another tray for the other side. I bought it anyway and had my brother-in-law make an additional tray and had him cut a new piece of dry erase board and glued it on top of the one that doesn't erase well. Now, it is perfect, and the supplies for the repairs/modifications, only [a few dollars], which is still way under what we would have paid for the little tikes mission stlye easel. You do need someone who can do small carpentry jobs, if not I would think twice about this easel."
5,classic fun,"My kids use this toy more than any other. This is all you need in an easel. The tray for chalk or paints switches from side to side, depending on what you need. It is foldable and classic looking. Timeless."
2,Try Sullivan instead,"This book is poor. Try Michael Sullivan's books instead. This book doesn't show you how to do the majority of the problems. I'm mostly flipping through the pages, trying to find the techniques, formulas, etc... but they are not there. I need this book for class (homework), but I'm using Sullivan's books to actually learn the material. If you have to use this book (like me), don't get discouraged. The material isn't difficult (and it's actually enjoyable) if you learn it step by step. This book, unfortunately, is another representation of mathematicians trying to explain easy material in a needlessly complicated way. Get another book before thinking you're not a math person."
1,Complete Trash,It's sad that so many schools have bought in to this book. It's so frightfully bad in so many ways that it staggers the imagination. Does anyone review these things?
2,"The typical ""tips and tricks"" approach to Windows","This book is not (really) worthless. It's just another set of tips on how to make better use of windows. Athough it claims to be aimed at experimented users, I would only advise it to beginners who wish to go a bit further than the default settings.What is dramatically missing in this book, as in many others, is an ARCHITECTURAL view of software. I consider this a disappointing move from O'Reilly: their other books are usually of much higher quality."
1,Be wary of this book as it may cause rather than solve probl,"WINDOWS ANNOYANCES has had a pretty good run, for the obvious reason that a book promising to clear up the myrid WIN 95 hassles will find an avid audience. But my experiences indicate caveat emptor: For example I followed the recommendations (pages 71-72) on using a batch file to clear the Documents menu: Result was the dreaded Blue Screen (fatal exception error)and a re-start in safe mode. Further the index is often inaccurate. My view-don't spend money on a book which may be more creative fiction that practical advice which works on your computer."
4,"Dense and useful, but a touch over the edge","The author cuts to the chase, confronting an annoying ""feature"" of Windows and handing out specific information about tweaking it for the better. This isn't one of those fluffy ""Tips for Using Windows that You'd Know if You'd Just Read the Online Help"" books. The difference is refreshing.On the down side, there's too much reliance on editing the registry. Unlike other fixes, registry hacks fall into the ""don't try to understand it, just do it"" category. But I've resisted such modifications, and I still find the book to be greatly useful. Too bad such a book was needed in the first place!"
5,Love this Clipper,I absolutely love this clipper. Loved it so much that I convinced a friend to buy one for herself! I totally recommend. I've had the clippers for about 7 months.
3,Does what we need it to do,"This tote bag works good for storage, but I wouldn't depend upon it for toting around a dutch oven. It is pretty thin and doesn't seem like it would withstand the weight of the oven when carried over time. If your oven has the legs on it you will definitely want something in the bottom of the bag to protect the legs from wearing through. I was disappointed to find that the bag was made in CHINA. There is nowhere that I found that this was stated on description page. The oven was made right here in the USA by LODGE in Tennessee, so I was expecting the bag, which also carries the LODGE brand name to be made there also. Unfortunately, the lid lifter which I also purchased was made in CHINA also but carries the LODGE name. I do what I can to purchase USA products. MADE IN should be posted on all pages!!!! But, all in all, this bag does what I want it to do, which is to store and protect our dutch oven on our camping trips."
5,Just great,"Nice strong bottom for legs, fits great, would be nice if there was a place for the lid lifter, still a great bag for your oven"
5,Lawrence,"I was greatly surprised how good the production of [[ASIN:B008L1VZS6 Un Giorno Di Regno]was. I did not have high expectations, but I saw a good review of it. The reason for low expectations was that this opera was considered a failure at the time it was presented at La Scala. There are possible explanations, such as this comic opera followed the deaths of his two small children and wife in a two year period. Perhaps, it was the production or the fact that this opera has much of Rossini in the style. It is a combination of Verdi and Rosini styles. Out of 26 operas, this one was only one of two comic operas by Verdi, the other the last of his, Falstaff - a tremendous success.Having set the foundation why I had low expectations, I was greatly surprised by the production. It had a good story, great music, great singing and acting. It was a great surprise and I would recommend this opera to anyone who enjoys Italian opera."
2,Be Careful With This Table,Our baby is six months old now and since she was born every couple weeks we have to rescrew in the bolts that hold the table together. The table really wobbles and sways with every movement our daughter makes. The lower shelves have warped now with the weight of wipes and extra baby bath on them. Try to find a model that is sturdier.
5,I love this table!,I would like for everyone to know that I absolutely love this changing table. It was super easy for me to put together and looks wonderful! Very sturdy. Price is also great! I'm able to put plenty of things underneath in baskets.I would recommended this table to anyone.
4,a necessity on a tight budget,"This changing table is great for the price. It's very sturdy and was easy to put together. I love the fact that it came with a changing pad and strap feature. I had to return the other pad I had gotten, and saved 20 dollars! The only complaint I had was that the top back rail I had to put in was not measured properly. The hole part was either too small or the part it was supposed to be attached to was too big. Anyways it cracked a little when I tried to attach it. I ended up grinding the part that goes in the hole to make it fit and the crack is not too noticeable. Again be careful when you put it together, since it seems to want to crack easily when you have to put the screws in for the metal bars that add the support for each shelf. Other than that, I love it. Very cute and economical."
2,Zero depth,"For something that advertises itself as the complete guide, it's completely lacking. Almost no information on tuning, way too general overview of cars w/ no discussion of various differences between the cars, pretty much nothing in the book that you can't figure out on your own.When I reserved my copy soon after the game was released it was advertised to me by the dude at the game store as being delayed because they were spending lots of time adding lots of information to the book, so it was going to be a truly complete, extremely informative book... instead, I find out later that it was only delayed due to licensing problems and has actually been finished for months, before the game was even officially released.It's not too poorly priced, but I wouldn't buy it if I had it to do over again. Last time I reserve a strategy guide ;)"
1,Unneccesary Book,"How can you sell a book of tips for a game that has already had it release date pushed back for at least 1 year so far and it is begining to appear that it will be pushed off for another year, maybe on some other plane of excistence that the game does one day hit the stores so the poor saps like myself that has had this game preordered for so long I should be charging intrest on the money I wasted waiting I might actually buy it but do like me and wait to see which comes first GT4 or Armageddon"
5,"One Good store, should be made into a movie","It is GOOD. Love, Hate, Relationships. All of it is in there. And come to think of it. This book is much more than just a SCI FI. You can see human nature in it as well."
2,A bad soap opera with a political agenda...,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I was very disappointed with the second half of this book, the award-winning Barrayar. Shards of Honor was good, although sometimes my suspension of disbelief was challenged, and there were some pretty glaringly amateur areas--the question/answer chapters.But Barrayar was full of cliched characters and plot. Predictable, nauseating. Cordelia is not the same woman she was in Shards of Honor. She is now a self-righteous foreigner who belittles the existing society of Barrayar, and Aral is reduced to a cardboard ""Yes Dear"" cutout. That really saddened me--he was the best part of Shards. Bujold seems to have expanded her overly-zealous mad-feminist and mommy-hood theme (which made me gag), reveling in pregnancy and birth (I've been there, done that, and can't say I find her story believable). Was it just the milleu of the '80s? It felt anachronistic to me."
2,Days of our Lives in space.,"This isn't a science-fiction novel- this is a Harlequin romance! If you like ornate costumes and Grand Royal in space then you'll love this book- everyone is so dashing and suave. Bujold seems obsessed with vain trivialities. Does Cordelia have bags under her eyes this morning?...What is the lordly lord wearing today? Oh, what a lovely ball, too bad there are assassins everywhere...No wonder Cordelia spends the entire book worrying and complaining. As for real science fiction? Forget it. Nothing of interest here. Her make-believe world is silly, shallow and implausible. It's all in the characters, and they'd make Barbara Cartland blush."
2,Tech support won't return calls,"Pros: Easy to use, nice displayCons: Does not accommodate heat pumps with auxiliary heating (""emergency heat""). When I called their tech support line, I reached an answering machine--and they did not ever return my call."
3,Not Exactly What I Thought,"Based on the title, I was hoping this book would talk about the nuts and bolts of starting a house church. It's really more of a treatise on why every house church should have a church planter involved with it to remain healthy. I share the author's opinion that a bible study is not a house church and that there is more than going through the forms of church to become one."
3,b-,No Queen of Heartsthe other reviewer was right/ a hodge podgeBetter to buy some original albums.The first is a classic.
5,A five star play about the state of medical care,"I was in the cast of this play with fellow nurses (and even a doc or two). I will never forget the tragedy of losing our precious friends. I was supposed to have been in that car and my then young son, Nathan, begged me to stay home.After the tragedy, we cancelled all plays and went on the perform the next year in honor of our castmates. They forever remain in our hearts. The CD hs many emotional songs and ones which many nurses and docs will relate.Barb Tracy"
2,Not What I Expected,"This book is not what I expected. I thought it was going to go more in depth to what the title suggested. I wasn't thinking Backyard wrestling, but I was hoping for at least some lines of text that wouldn't insult my intelligence. This book would be better suited for the first time wrestling viewer who wanted to take it a whole different level."
5,"tamagotchis, the best toy ever",Tamagotchis are the absolout best toy ever. They are so fun I love the store its awsome! The best thing about it is you never know what your going to get for charicters. Collecting gotchi points and shopping for cool stuff. The only bad thing is that you have to be an adult to use most of the stuff. Tamas are totally genius. There amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,borinng,its a rip off.guess what mine always sleep.you get tired of it it sucks.you should have sims 2
5,passion,lots of steamy scenes in this book and i liked that there was a good story too. this was a good passionate quick read. i enjoyed it. and i would recommend it if you want a quick and easy summer read.
5,Best game ever!,"We had both the Nintendo and the Prima guide for this game. According to my son, this is the better book if you just want the hints and don't want the guide to spoil the game for you. Also, he said that this guide has better pictures."
5,Banned from school,My kids loved these things for months until their school banned them. Now each kid (8 and 10) had acquired about 10 each and now they sit in their draws. Well worth the money for the amount of fun and use they got out of them in the beginning.
5,"Just Read Frank's Books, OK","I've read Prophet & the 2 ""Darkness"" books and I know these were great books just because of the fact that I couldnt put them down. No other books were as gripping and mind captivating. I believe in the spiritual world and I think Frank gives a great perspective on the ever present Battle between Gods Angels and satan and his demons. Im just sorry the books had to end. hey Frank, if you ever read this--my message to you is KEEP ON WRITING!!! and Fight the Good Fight!!!"
4,Fantastic book,This book is a great addition to any Christian reader looking for a fiction book that both encourages and strengthens your spirit. Both books give a realistic look into satan's attacks on our minds and lives yet leaves you encouraged to continue the fight. Hope this book blesses you as much as it has me.
1,Not readable.,"Mr. Peretti does now how to excite, but not how to write. Iread his book Prophet, but the characters in that book were socliche... It was like reading some harlequin book. Besides, I don't think that the word theology is apropiately used in this genre. Books like this tend to be superficial and not profound, which theology should be."
5,Life Changing,"I was introduced to Frank Peretti in ""Piercing the Darkness"" and then to ""This Present Darkness"". He has a way of showing the world in two ways. The spiritual fight we go thru and the worldly fight. He has opened my eyes to a lot of things: the way we are to fight and the importance of a prayer covering. Both are excellent books and I would recommend them to anyone. In fact I have bought more and given them away to friends."
5,Gripping account of everpresent spiritual warfare,Fantasic books. The story is fictional or is it? The reader is kept in the story so much that you are looking behind trees for the demons that are there and depending on the angel warriors there to protect.
4,Joyce Meyer's book's,I have read many of Joyce Meyer's books and enjoy all of them. This is no exception. Since so small you can carry it in a pocket and keep it in the car to read when waiting for someone.The verses are so inspirational.
5,Jesus is the High Priest of your confession!,"As believers, we overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of our confession. Let the Word of God dwell in you richly by speaking it out of your mouth!"
5,Wonderful Spiritual tool!,The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word by Joyce Meyer is a wonderful help for dealing with life from God's prospective. So many times we become negative when faced with problems. This book gives us the assurance that through the power of Scripture we can bring positive results out of negative. Each subject outlined in the book has Scripture references given to speak to the issue at hand. Jesus addressed each lie Satan tempted Him with by quoting Scripture. This book is a powerful tool in the hands of a believer!
1,Stopped Working On 3rd DVD,"I received this DVD player last week and was so excited! We plugged it in and played a DVD and it was great! We played another one - great! Then, on the third DVD, it just stopped working. We checked the power source, tried different discs - nothing. It completely stopped working. Based I my experience, I can not recommend this product."
2,DISAPPOINTED,Works great but battery life is so short it's not worth buying unless you don't mind plugging it into an electric outlet.
5,wonderful and gripping,"the latest novel from susanna kearsley is just wonderful. i have read everything that she has written , and i found the narration to be tight, smooth and extremely enjoyable. her mix of the paranormal, mystery, romance and suspense in other hands might come across as ""cheesy"", but ms. kearsley deftly weaves a spell that enchanted me from beginning to end. it is easy to see the amount of research she does for a novel, and the end result is a story that will make you stay up until all hours finishing it, as i did last night!"
2,drought,"pages and pages that hint of a depth that is never realized. one of those plow-thru novels that concludes suddenly in a two-page rush,a predictable two-page rush."
1,A -WASTE -OF MONEY & TIME,"I purchased this DVD expecting alot of good info,what I got was a big ripoff some guy running his gums saying nothing.I purchased 2 D70s cameras and found the instruction book to be the best help.Plzz save your money buying this DVD,get the real deal Read!!!! the instruction info book."
1,terrible controlls,"I like the game, but it is very hard to play on the PS3. The graphics are a bit choppy and jump around..and there are some points of the game where you have to do some silly things with the motion sensing PS3 controller (you can't get by that part of the game unless you use that motion sensing feature.)We had this game for the PS3, but ended up selling it used and getting it for the Xbox 360. The game itself can be fun....but do yourself a favor, if you have BOTH the Xbox 360 and PS3...make sure you choose the Xbox 360 version for this game."
1,God Awful,The game sucks. I cant believe i bought this at 25 then went and sold it for 15. The camera angle is the problem. U are unable to control your view as well as the awkward controls and the story.... what story.
3,"Fun at first, but way too repetitive!","BOTTOM LINE:It's great for most kids under 10yrs old. As a fan of Marvel comics, I loved to see some favorite characters on screen. Once I got past the initial moment of watching different characters do their moves - it was DOWNHILL FROM THERE.You mash buttons over, and over, and over, and over....and thats pretty much it! Hit, Jump, Block, Dogde, Run, Rinse, Repeat, until the game finally ends.And the ending couldn't have come quick enough.PROS: Great selection of charactersstoryline reads like a good comic book.CONS: Graphic are top of the line PS2 at bestso repetitive it gets boringbigger sprites for Arcade co-op, okay?Uhhhh...Incredible Hulk????make the ENTIRE environment destructible.all levels are similar mazes."
4,All-encompassing tome for collectors,"This book is the definitive source for comic book prices for the hobbyist to the professional dealer. You will be able to find a price for every comic in your collection, from the Platinum Age (1900-1938) on up through the Modern Age (1980 to present).My only wish is that Overstreet would present more examples (photos especially) of what to look for when grading a comic. That would go a long way in helping collectors accurately grade their comics."
4,Memory in death ex,Very good and love J.D Robb love eve and Rorake there relationship all characters especially Peabody. All in death books are great
3,An okay read but not the best,"I was very much looking forward to ""Memory in Death"" by J.D. Robb, but after finishing it I could have waited for the paperback. Eve and Peabody are in the middle of investigating the death of a santa who fell thirty-seven stories when Trudy Lombard, Eve's first foster mother show up. It quickly becomes clear that Trudy looking for money. So when Roarke and Eve go to tell Trudy to get out of town they find her dead. So beings the investigation into Trudy's to see who else she backmailed and who wanted her dead.This just wasn't one of Ms.Robbs best book. The ending was just to neat and the characters were not that interesting this time around. I am hoping that ""Born in Death"" will be better."
3,Cheaply made but looks ok...,"Interesting to watch, and looks nice as the backdrop to my kitchen bar (just above the stove). The taped line holding the NYC scenery together is clearly visible in one area, highlighting the low quality of this motion lamp. Note it does not have any holes for wall mounting - I used stick on velcro to mount it to the wall, which works well since the unit is very light. Not sure how long it will last, but I plan on turning it on for only a few hours a week - time will tell!"
1,"A Few, Minor Mistakes?","This is a book about Gettysburg that identifies a photograph of Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Stoughton, who was noteven at Gettysburg, as Joshua L. Chamberlain of the 20th Maine Regiment, hero of the novel ""The Killer Angels"" andfamously portrayed in the movie ""Gettysburg"". There is a lot of information between the covers of this creation; it's just not reliable. Wake up and smell the coffee ...."
2,When Design Overtakes Content,"I was drawn to this book on the shelf, and optimistic upon leafing through it. There's a great use of typography and white space not often seen in historical publications of this nature. But perhaps there's a reason for that...This is a great example of a book's design taking precedence over its subject matter. While the grid use and minimalist photo treatment is stylish and contemporary, it's not conducive to this particular audience--an audience expecting to enjoy larger, more detailed photographs and content.I don't entirely blame the designer for the book's failure, either--it was a mistake for the publisher to call it ""Definitive"", when it truly isn't. This only makes the design flaw more glaring.Students of design may find the book more interesting than Civil War buffs. It's a beautifully designed book--it's just that in this instance, the design is very wrong for the subject matter."
1,Nothing new here!,"You can sure tell that this year is the 140th anniversary of the battle...everyone has come out from under their rock with a new book...but with little new to say...this is definately no exception! My money, my time, and some printers paper could have definately been put to better use elsewhere."
2,Samsung SGH phone,"This phone was obviously reconditioned. I believe it originated from overseas, Asia area because all graphics were in Asian symbols, and when set in English, words were spelled differently than we do in the US. Did not like the phone at all and soon bought a new one from my service provider."
4,Awesome,I bought these for my dad for my wedding. They're the kind of style that a young or older guy could wear. Classic yet unique. Love the purple color too.
3,Disappointed,"I expected a book that gave me tips on eating better when I'm out on the road. Like all the popular places, choose this item for less calories, less fat, etc. So....for all of Oklahoma City (my hometown), it showed the Healthfood Store. If I'm traveling, I won't be going to a grocery store to eat. Just not what I expected!"
2,nothing but driving directions!,"This book was a real disappointment: each listing has from 0 to 10 words about each establishment, and then LENGTHY driving directions. I can read a map - I'd rather have some detail about the restaurants / cafes / stores. As much info as in this book I could get from a phone book and save the cost of the book."
1,Really bad.,"Nothing less than the worst Hollywood film of the 1980's. A tale of bloody horror, explicit violence, misogyny, xenophobia, racism, sexism, and religious prejudice. But it's Spielberg, so take the whole family!!!!!!"
1,Worst Sequel of All Time!!!!,Spend your money on the classic RAIDERS and excellent LAST CRUSADE. Please don't subsidize bad film-making. Thank you.
2,The worst Jones movie.,"The best parts of this movie was the beggining and the end, all the stuff in between was weird and I hate the human sacrifice part and all the crud with the voodoo doll.The end was pretty good though with the mine chase and the bridge and everything.Raiders was way better."
1,I only have it for the collection,"Raiders was awsome, and Empire strikes Back had just come out. Lucas even admitted that when he wrote both Empire and Temple, he was going through a divorce. And so both movies are dark, I have to say this movie doesn't even feel like an Indiana Jones movie. Kate Capshaw screams all the way through this movie, Short Round adds nothing to the movie. And the Nostalgia Critic is right, Indy says he doesn't believe in the power of the stones, but yet all of a sudden does at the end. There really is no reason for him to go after the stones, not a good Indiana Jones movie. The only reason I have it, is to complete the collection."
3,"Barely worthy of the name Jones, but not horrible","This is without a doubt the worst jones movie in the series. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible movie, but i recommend seing raiders and last crusade first. The plot line is ok, nothing special...while trying to find magic stones indy discovers a thugee cult. some very good action scenes, but also some very lousy scenes. If willie screamed in that movie one more time, i would have destroyed my tv set. If you are a jones fan, then you will probably like it, but not to much."
4,"Not the best of the original trilogy, but still good","Out of the original trilogy, this movie is the weakest of the three, but the other two movies were SO good that 'weak' in comparison really isn't a bad thing. I gave this film 4 out of 5 stars because it is still a good movie that I enjoyed a lot - it's just not QUITE as good as the other films, but don't hold it against this! It is a bit more cheesy than the other films, such as eyeball soup at the banquet or ripping out people's hearts or such, but this movie is still a very fun romp and if you liked the first movie, then watch this!"
2,"Temple of Doom: A Trip to ""Bad Dreams""...","I saw INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM at the theater when it first came out in 1984. The ""Test"" for me was going with an old boyfriend, but the sequences and DARKNESS in those ""certain"" gross scenes are still ""uneasy fare for the gut"", 27 years later. Im married since '85, and now, having now sat thru it a second time with my 21 year old son, it is ME hiding my eyes asking HIM ""Is it over yet?"" Its no wonder they needed a brighter,exciting, REAL adventure for #3 and they came thru adding Sean Connery as Indy's Dad..THAT one Ive seen many time, but Ladies? Why suffer ""gastric distress"" if you don't have to? AVOID #2... at least for a GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP!"
2,Temple of Dumb,"In the great chain of Indiana Jones movies, this is the regretful weak link.Too much emphasis was placed on razzle-dazzle special effects, not enough on character development.The scenes of graphic and sadistic violence so alarmed the film industry that the PG-13 rating was brought into being.Fortunately, the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade movie put the series back on track, which was good.Regretfully, though, this move was NOT good."
5,Great deal!,"This tea is delicious-flavorful, aromatic. It was a wonderful bargain and I would recommend it to anyone who likes oolong tea."
2,Moderately useful. Don't recommend,"Competitive Karting presents useful information on trackside preparation and basic kart maintenance. The information is clouded, though, by poor editing and unclear graphics. Famous racecar driver names are misspelled, 'kevlar' has become 'kevar,' and a spell check program was obviously not considered. It's tough to accept precision driving and setup information from someone who has taken such little care in crafting his message."
5,Great Gate for Pets,"Perfect for small dogs (ours: 1- 29 lbs and 1- 23 lbs.) Easy to move around and expand. Lightweight, easly to climb over and the dogs really don't try to push themselves out. I have 2 gates."
5,Highly Recommended,This gate does the job handsomely. Whodathunk you can get function and beauty? Don't waste your money buying something cheaper that doesn't quite fit your needs-you'll end up paying the same or more when you despair and have to try something different.
5,Even better than I thought,These gates are so pretty! Much better than the suitcases we had been using!)They actually look nice for such a utilitarian purpose.Our gates are in a prominent place in the house- so we see them all the time.I did not want something cheap looking in my place- although I did not want to spend a lot. For my purposes they work well as we have two 5 lb senior chi wow wows. No worries on them pushing through. It is not flimsy nor super light so seem like it would work for dogs larger and younger than ours. They have a Stickley or Mission furniture appearance.Now I need to figure a way to have a set mounted into the wall at the top of my staircase- so they can swing open and shut.
3,This was almost the perfect gate.,"This gate is attractive, easy to assemble, very portable and would be perfect if my puppy weren't quite so athletic. At 7 pounds, my ""pocket puggle"" figured out how to jump over this gate within 3 days. I would still recommend it for anyone with old dogs or smaller dogs than mine. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find one that is just a few inches taller."
4,Stand Alone,"The best thing about this gate is that it is free standing and can be used in spaces where a normal ""doorframe-held"" gate can't be put. Also it's attractive wood, and not a metal eyesore. The downside of this is that the holes and screws for adjusting it to size, are not smartly planned. Once it's put together, it stays that way unless you undo the whole thing. No quick way to make it larger or smaller (and I have need of that). Also the pre-cut holes for screws aren't numerous enough. I was missing a screw too, so it's held together by only one on top. I think it's poorly designed in that respect. The screws are 'special' and not something you have in your tool box. But I give it high marks for eye appeal and stand alone ability."
5,Perfect for Our Needs,"We need to keep our dog out of the lower level of our house when we're not home. He's not very curious, so won't push it aside. Some dogs I've had would, so it's not for everybody. It's easy for us to move out of the way so we don't have to step over it to go down the stairs with a basket of laundry. Our 5 year old can move it easily when he wants to go down to play. Easy to assemble. A good product."
5,"Funk, Faith and Fun","Smart and hilarious, this future cult-classic will make you laugh, think, and laugh again. Really great stuff..."
4,QUARTET SESSION,"The correct title is - The Hank Jones Trio Plus The Flute Of Bobby Jaspar, if you read the small print. Bobby plays flute on all tracks."
2,grrr,i was a fan since their album silence came . i did'nt bother to get this one yet and then about a burning fire came out . i did not enjoy this album . its stupid .when christian is singing he is actually rapping . when hes screaming his voice is really downtuned it doesnt sound like he is screaming . so it's an awkward album but not every band has a great beginning
5,I love these guys,"They have a great blend of wizard guitars and rad vocals. They're a great mix b/w hardcore, funk and punk."
1,Worst,This is by far the WORST movie ever made. Be aware that Brain Damage truly makes awlful movies.What a waste!
3,A GrabBag Book,"2 1/2 stars, really. The Combat Handbook is really just a collection of rules & examples from other 5th edition Hero Systems books. I would recommend this to gamers who have bought SIDEKICK and are just getting into the Hero System. If you have 5th Edition and any of the other books, then you don't need this book.Recycled contents for the newbie, the completist or Hero Games maniac."
5,Very Helpful Math Book for ESOL Students!,This book is very helpful to ESOL students. It has lower reading ability than most Algebra books so the students aren't overstressed while learning to read and write in English and learning Algebra at the same time.
4,Barry White,"Hey, good soundtrack, but i'd like to know the name of the Barry White song in the movie."
2,Not The Same,This is just not the same as the movie sound track. Some movie songs were just not included and other songs used as auburn fill. In all a nice Jazz mix.
1,Not representative of Catholicism.,"Not recommended. Why bother with this tosh when you can read the doctors of the Church, the saints, the Holy See, and other goodies?"
2,Why was this filmed?,"I fell under the spell of Jim Thompson's great short novel ""This World, Then the Fireworks"" about ten years ago. The story was absolutely unforgettable pulp fiction--mysterious and multilayered. Why, oh, why, did somebody attempt to translate it to film? One may as well try to literalize a poem. Horrible. Comes across as a joke, a pantomime, some kind of weird Hollywood B-actor salute to noir: Billy Zane and Gina Gershon? Gawd. Read the story. Skip the movie."
3,AN IN-ZANE MOVIE !,"This is a kinky and twisted movie with a dash of black humor. Only Zane can pull off such a character with his ""pushing the envelope"" and zany ( zaney ? ) acting ability. As for Gershon (those lips) she plays her character as the wanton sister very well. I guess it's that underlying hint at incest between Zane's and Gershon's characters as well as the dysfunctional family atmosphere exuded by Rue McClannahan as their ailing mother that may disturb some viewers. Otherwise, this is a great art house flick if you like films out of the ordinary with bizarre characters and a peculiar story !"
4,Nice Thompson ambiance,"Well, I liked it, folks. The nastiness of the original is nicely captured. I ain't gonna analyze it because analyzing is all about rationalizing what you can't deal with. Like Gummo, this is the world as others pretend not to see it. But it's in all of our heads all the time. It's just that most of us have it so deeply hidden & buried that we live for shrink & therapist. This would make a nice double bill with Woman Chaser. Long live Thompson & Willeford & David Goodis."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Vague references, unsatisfying conclusions. It was kind of fun and then got silly. Seems to have a lot of padding."
1,"Not an ""encyclopedia"" on the unsolved","I expected the book to be like a reference on everything from ufo's to missing person cases. Instead it is a book that appears to be hastily put together with a handful of stories thrown out there. There is also no referencing of sources -- so again two people, wanting to just sell a book, read a bunch of ufo, creature sighting, etc stories on the internet and re-tell it in their own paraphrasing. Most of the stories are the usual popular ones that are circulated, nothing new here. A perfect example of ""be careful what you buy online"""
5,Amazing!,"How has this toy NOT been reviewed yet?OMG My 18 month old adores it! Very open ended play. The rubber bits are a tad small for her so I put those away for now!Great way to teach feelings, colors, action/reaction, sequence, and more!It comes with a book to read along with to make it more of a game and to get parents involved!BUY THIS!Aside from the education aspects....you are getting 6 high quality WOOD eggs! They are true to life and work well in play kitchens! BONUS!"
5,Hilarious!,"I absolutely love the books in this series. There isn't a funnier series! I wish my pranks on my friends would turn out to be this good...The Hatford boys wanted and were expecting some boys to move into their friends' house. But they were surprised that three girls moved into the house. So the boys play tricks on the girls to make them move away, finally the girls get sick of the stupid pranks, and draw the battleline, and that is when The Girls Get Even!"
4,Great book that will help you understand the product,"If you are tasked with setting up SMS 2.0, this book is a must. It explains all the terms ina clear manner and make it easy to understand. However, as with all Microsoft Press books, it doesn't go into every little detail and that can lead to frustration. A good example with that is the SMS Installer section. My advice, skip it and wait for the book by Rod Trent."
3,Enjoyed Her Husbands More,"After reading the glowing reviews, and absolutely loving 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' which this has been so often compared, I couldn't wait to read this. As I started the book, I read over a hundred pages in one sitting and was drawn immediately in with characters that are wonderfully drawn and specific. Unfortunately, it ultimately didn't resonate the way I was hoping. Frankly the fault could be mine, because as I began to put the book down and leave it for a day or two,the shifting narratives started to become confusing.I would recommend to anyone for maximum enjoyment, read this in as few sittings as possible. There's no denying she's a great writer,for me it just lost it's momentum along the way."
3,Kindle version,Good story and well written but with three different narrators jumping around timeframes I found it rather difficult to follow on my Kindle. Picked up a paperback copy from the library and was much better able to follow the storyline and enjoyed finishing the book
3,Confusing,I had high hopes for this book after reading such rave reviews. I found the plot confusing to follow and agree with the advice to read the book in fewer settings to help keep track of the change in narrators. The only character that motivated me to keep reading was Leo Gursky but alas I found the ending disappointing.
1,BORING,"I could not get into the characters at all, so ended up not finishing the book. It was selected for our book club. Too esoteric for me - a complete waste of time"
5,I am hard to please,"And this book pleases me. It is written with great compassion and insight, it breaks your heart the language is sensitive and stirring, the images evocative.... a wonderful new book to be cherished by many."
1,"Loved Leo, didn't get the point","I loved the beginning of this book. Leo's story seemed to have so much substance ahead. I kept reading so that I could learn what The History of Love was. I didn't learn a thing! After the initial Leo segment, I was confused, bored and disappointed in the next few chapters. Once the mystery was solved, I guess the book got better but by then, the story was over. I thought it was a depressing look at life and love and I didn't get what the History of Love was at all from this book."
2,Couldn't Even Finish!,"Ugh - this book was so slow that I couldn't even finish it (which vary rarely happens to me). I guess if you like the unique writing style (multiple narrators, stream-of-conciousness style), the book may appeal to you, but it just didn't work for me. Aside from the slow plot, I also found it difficult to relate to the characters."
3,Too confusing for my taste,"I couldn't really figure out who all the characters were and why telling their stories was important until about 3/4 of the way through. That is a long time to be confused. Granted, I read late at night in bed when I'm probably too tired to be 100% aware of what is going on. But this book was one of the most confusing I'd read in a while. I liked the idea of the story generally, and each character's story was interesting and well-written. But I kept getting distracted by what was, to me, a lack of continuity and cohesiveness. I would recommend being a little more awake when reading this book than I was."
4,More please...,This is the kind of book you don't want to end quite yet... I will readsome more of Krauss!
2,"I WANTED to love this book, just didn't!","I started this book with such high hopes. I feel in love with Leo right away and was so excited to ""enter"" his life. The story for me, however, got confusing FAST. I couldn't follow what was what and who was who... I think that was supposed to be part of the charm but for me, wasn't. I read the whole story hoping there would be some redemption in the end, but was sorely disappointed. Good luck!"
2,Not for me...,"Some people really loved this book. I wish I was able to connect with the characters. Alas, I could not & stopped reading. All is not lost. I gave it to my sister who loved it; therefore, I'm not sorry to have purchased this."
1,Everything is still not illuminated,"I won't finish this book. It strikes me as another version of Everything Is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Froer and really, once was more enough for me."
1,Steamed,"If this wasn't a mandatory read for school, then I wouldn't have read this piece of junk in the first place. The plot was disjointed, jumping around character POV and writing styles. If a better plot was used then maybe the author may have been able to pull this off but in the scope of boring OLD john everyman this book was boring. Understanding without something like sparknotes is also a colossal challenge. When a read is mandatory I expect a well written piece of literature, not some half baked mockery of a book. I don't know why but instead of love, this book gave me intense hatred."
4,A Lifetime Of Betrayal And Hope,"This is a story about a man, Leopold Gursky, who lost everything because of the Holocaust. His love for his childhood sweetheart, and their child, who was adopted by another man, gave him something to live for. The resolution of many betrayals in this book would not be satisfying in life, but within the context of this novel, played themselves out wonderfully.There has recently been a spate of books using the Holocaust as background. Unless there are unused, insightful ways to use the Holocaust, this can be tedious. The betrayals in ""The History Of Love"" are differently portrayed than others I've read and unfortunately show novel ways people could have been victimized.Krauss is a skillful writer who lets each character play himself out without sentimentality, and perfectly within the parameters of her story. I strongly recommend this book."
2,Dazed and Confused,"A friend from work gave me this book with the highest recommendation! If a book is good, we pass it around to our little group. I found it very difficult to follow along and without giving anything away, I want to say that I really liked the characters BUT at the end of the book I had no idea what happened. I could make no sense out of the book and i had to go around asking other people that read the book to explain it to me. Since i'm not the only one this happened to (quite a few other people had the same experience)I just wanted to make the average reader be aware that you may have to read it twice to figure it out."
3,This could have been great,Ms. Krauss is a talented writer. Her prose is absolutely georgeous. I found the book funny and brave and moving. My only problem with the book was the editing. Why did they make it so difficult for the reader to follow the action? There were so many times when I was confused. Who is talking? Where are we now? Who said what? AHHHH!! I kept reading because the good outweighed the bad but felt so horrible that this book would never be what it could have been...GREAT!
3,The History of Love,"The author is talented....however the book was delibrately confusing. Some times though, the author has given us some beautiful words. I have mixed feelings about this book"
3,Bizarre,So it was a very interesting tale. I got fairly involoved in the first few chapters. It got kinda hard to follow. And some of the story just didnt make sense. And the ending was very bizarre. I enjoyed reading and would recommend reading it once.
3,Ok for stainless not great does streak,This product is just ok. I wanted streak free shine for my stainless and to use this for spot cleaning. So far I can't use it on my fridge it streaks way to much and so I end up using it for spot cleaning on my stainless garbage can and mircowave. Not a great product at all.
5,Absolutely engrossing!,"How I, after reading scifi for more than 25 years, have missed out on the Hyperion series - is beyond me. The story and the universe Simmons describes is just that slightly ""off"" compared to other novels Ive read - that I was completely engrossed reading both these and the other Hyperion novels - wanting to find out what was really happening with the Shrike and all.This is a classic!"
3,"Good book, hundreds of typos.","I like Hyperion, it's a good book 4.5/5 stars. But the Kindle edition has so many typos that I have to write a review about it.Literally every 3-4 sentences. ""Tne(The)"", ""Those ate(are)magnificent"", ""Thejre were none"", ""Time Tpmbs"". Hundreds of these typos, there were even a couple missing periods It's as if there was no QA or editing done at all. Like some dude just typed this up in one sitting and said ""That'll do, ship it"". I can't imagine the original paper version would have this many errors."
5,Imaginative and engrossing,"I am an avid sf/fantasy reader, and I have to say that this and its sequel (actually, second half) ""Fall of Hyperion"" are among the best books I have ever read. The plot concept is wildly imaginative, and the execution is wonderful. It's one fascinating surprise after another, science fiction with a strong fantasy element. I loved it. Just be sure to buy BOTH books, as the first stops suddenly, leaving a craving for the second."
4,Great Read,"Loved the book. Suggestion: Buy the whole series in one go, and read them all (at the very least Hyperion and The fall of Hyperion). Otherwise, after reading the final sentence in the first book, you'll catch yourself staring into space with a blank look on your face, thinking ""What the heck...?"""
4,Loved it despite the ending,"I really liked the frame story structure, though some of the stories were hard to get through. I found the Poet's Tale particularly annoying, though I suspect it was the author's intent for you to dislike Martin Silenus. The story of Sol and Rachel was very moving and for me was the highlight of the book.One complaint I have is the book does not stand on its own. Make sure you have a copy of The Fall of Hyperion on hand when you finish this one.Some other minor complaints are the use of colloquialisms from the present era. The Ousters could have used a more thorough introduction."
2,Not a sci-fi fan,"(Due to computer error, this is the third time I had to write a review for this book. So my review will be very short, because I'm very frustrated)Boring and Confusing"
1,"Profane, Vulgar, and Indecent","What a disappointment Hyperion was. After reading all the hype about the book, I was excited to read it. I only wish someone had written something about the muck one has to wade through to get to the story. This book is profane, vulgar, and indecent. It reminded me of third grade when certain kids learned crude words and tried to use them as often as possible. I threw the book into the trash can with the rest of the garbage before I could finish it. I will not recommend Hyperion to anyone, young or old."
4,Decent,"Not a bad novel, not a great one either. This book only begins the story, it doesn't have an ending. The story just begins with this novel. The timing of the stories seem awfully convenient. Nonetheless, the tales were intriguing, and I look forward to reading the second book."
4,Highly entertaining,"I found Dan Simmon's Hyperion to be an entertaining, thought-provoking and compelling novel. The stories of each of the pilgrims were masterpieces of short fiction in their own right. Although I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan, I give it 4, rather than 5, stars as I found Simmons' writing to be at times over-descriptive and somehow lacking the true can-put-it-down momentum of a master storyteller. Although I am one to appreciate some ambiguity at the end of a novel, I felt like after all the build-up, Simmons owed us more at the end of the story than the obvious compulsion to turn to the next book in the series. With the right ending, I would have been left thinking about the many great themes in the work. Instead, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed. Nonetheless, I certainly look forward to continuing this series."
3,decent read - although it was difficult to suspend reality,"Its a decent book, its just way too far fetched in a few instances. A giant tree with a force field around it is a space ship that flies around in space faster than light speed. A tree!! This book would have been a lot better if it would have left out the few really rediculous parts, because most of it was otherwise believable - there were just a few parts where I was shaking my head. I guess I'm just more into hard scifi - Asimov's Foundation series is still my favorite scifi of all time."
5,What a find!,I have been reading science fiction for over 40 years and I follow the genre closely. I was very surprised to find that I had not only missed Hyperion when it came out but the succeeding 3 books. I have seen the title in many bookstores and passed it out of sheer ignorance. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed two books as wonderful as Hyperion and the Fall of Hyperion. The best part of the books is how those groups that seem to be good and evil reverse themselves to climax in a moving ending. Thank you Mr. Simmons
1,Hyperion Cantos,"I am an inveterate Sci-Fi reader and usually wade through even a poorly written book to see if there aren't some redeeming qualities. I didn't finish this one. The plot and characters could have been written by a computer program. Always take a book review as from someone who doesn't necessarily share your tastes, however, if you were a friend, I would advise you to spend your reading dollar elsewhere."
1,I'd rather be sailing,"A lesson really, that all the fancy awards and 5-star ratings simply do not mean much in some cases. Hyperion is one of these cases, while its universe is described adequately and it has some ok ideas. Other (ideas) are not so original, such as guys in body hugging skin suits, running around, making inhuman leaps and decapitating people (hello Paul!) ..or the poor AI seeking freedom for itself. It is quite thick though, so hey, you can use it as a monitor stand or something."
2,Post-modern science fiction,"Maybe I'm just not the right demographic for this novel, but I hated the beginning, tolerated the middle and put it down permanently near the end. The model is the Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, but I don't think it works. I just never got interested in the characters enough to care what happened to them and for me, the story--stories, really--never came into focus. I guess the New York Times Book Review should have tipped me off because they compare it to Frank Herbert's Dune and the Foundation series of Asimov, both of which, in my opinion have aged really badly. I never realized how bad Dune was until I saw the awful movie of it.The fundamental metaphors operating in Hyperion seem to be backwards living. Well, ok, but I just don't see what it is a metaphor for. Nor, by page 473 where I finally gave up, did I care."
1,This book is unreadable,"I have read science fiction for more than 40 years, I am a scientist by training and profession, and I found this book completely unreadable back in the 90's. How it has survived to be more than a doorstop (and managed sequels at that) is more puzzling than the 16 dimensions of quantum mechanics."
2,Horribly over-rated,"It seems that I'm the only person in the world who has read Hyperion and not loved it. I found the independent stories mostly unbelievable and stupid - let's take Rachel's story, for example; isn't it classic scifi in the negative sense of the term? A simple idea, looks brilliant on paper but turns out to be impossible to do well enough? The same can be said of the whole epic. Simmons just rushed head over heels into something he couldn't handle. And the basic plot drags on without awaking a spark of interest in me. I'm just glad it stopped before the climax; now I only have to avoid the rest of the series so that I'll never have to know what sorry idiocies our beloved author made up for the ending."
2,Just a note on the Kindle version,Not commenting on the tale here... it's a good story. But the Kindle version is so riddled with typos and errors that it is incredibly distracting.Very disappointing.
4,Great Read But Be Warned,"This is a great book, and while I do not think it is the greatest SF book ever written, I will say I agree with many of the reviews I've read. The only thing I think worth adding is this warning: This is the beginning of a series of books and while the various sub-stories which make up the book are more or less complete, the novel does not actually end. It leaves you with a lot of What about this? and what about that? I have yet to read anymore in the series, but I really hate when I'm forced to because I want to know how a story turns-out and the author wants to sell more books by putting the answer in part 2. I much prefer a novel that is complete within itself even if it is part of a greater series of works. Regardless of all that, I still recommend the book."
2,I can't see what everyone else is raving about!,"I was suprised to see this on the list of ""raves"" here at Amazon.com. I found it especially odd to find some reviews comparing it with Ender's Game (one of my favorites). I can hardly think of two sci-fi books more different.I will say that the writing was quite good. That is why I decided to complete the book, but I was looking forward to getting to the end. Then when I reached the end and realized that this was only the first of a series I felt cheated. I knew I wouldn't read the second, but had absolutely no sense of resolution."
1,Enough already with season 1,"Okay, like, enough already with the season one DVD. The season one DVD has been out, like what, a couple of years or so, right? And, I realize, the money makers are milking it as long as they can because they know no one will buy season one once the remaining episodes go to DVD.But, enough already! Release the rest of the episodes to DVD! Stop making fans such as myself, who can no longer afford cable, wait."
5,Truly satisfying,"The early episodes on this DVD collection show awkward strain. But when this series hits its stride (particularly on the 2nd DVD), there is nothing quite like it. Lisa Bonet begins to play her part less like the awkward stressed little girl and starts to give off a cool, collected, above-it-all princess vibe who is in full control and that is truly something to see.The writing also comes together and a world is created that gives so much pleasant comfort, though there is some decline on the latter episodes on disc 3.If you need to experience a world that can give pleasant comfort in a understated way (the latter first era shows on the 1st DVD, the golden period of the 2nd DVD and the few golden era episodes on the 3rd DVD), you should get this."
3,"A fun, easy read that captures much of the BVI","I found ""Sunfun Calypso"" on my fourth trip to the British Virgin Islands and read it as I was flying home. The book is a fun, easy read that captures much of the moods and dramas of the islands. If you've ever had the urge to move to the BVI, you should definitely read this first."
5,Very Happy Reading,"I had a book of A Child's Garden of Verses when I was a young girl. Recently I remembered some of the poems and wanted to read them again. When I found this book on Amazon I ordered it right away, and it arrived in just a week. It was beautiful. Much prettier than my original book, and in excellent condition, although it was listed as ""used"". It came from Goodwill of Southwest Florida. I am far from a child now, but I am enjoying reading these poems even more now that I did years ago. I will always trust this Goodwill to send a good book to me."
2,In the Shadow of the Law,"This is a great book if you are looking for case details, but it is a difficult read if you want to whiz through it like a Grisham novel. It was somewhat entertaining, but painted a very bleak view of life in a law firm and unethical practices which don't necessarily exist everywhere. I would not recommend it."
2,Demasiado,"Nada que objetar a este album. Ballads es fantástico de principio a fin, pero, ya está bien de reediciones con el único fin de lucrarse un poquito más. Hace 3 años teníamos la versión en CD. Después sacan la versión remasterizada. Ahora la que contiene tomas alternativas. Mañana será una nueva mezcla, pasado la que contiene la versión hip hop y dentro de cinco años la que incluye el autógrafo de la madre de John Coltrane. Ya está bien. 7 tomas alternativas son demasiadas tomas alternativas. ¿Tan mal está el mercado para tener que hacer ésto?."
1,wrong one,"ordered for 2003 F-250, according to Direct Auto there is a light duty F-250 Super Duty, so did not fit. I'm out around $25.00 on a part that didn't fit."
4,"Will, yes....","Now don't get me wrong: Downing fans don't come much bigger than this one here. And so when I heard overseas that Sensual Journey was on the market I couldn't wait till I got a hold of it. So many glowing reviews....And yes, I liked it.He plays the full range of his extraordinary vocals, he is a talented songwriter, and when he covers songs he often does a better job than the original artist.But that's where the excitement ended for me. Something was missing... maybe originality, or maybe just his heart - he sounds almost too perfect.... whatever it was, I played the cd up and down again hoping to really, really bond, but much as I'd like to, it just doesn't strike the same nerve that ""Moods"", one of his previous releases, did.I hesitated between giving him 3 and 4 stars - I gave him 4 because after all he still is the incredibly talented, the smooth and sensual, the one and only Mr. Downing."
2,Read Your Way Through This Short Film,St. Anthony of Padua is my favorite saint so I was hoping to enjoy the story of his life. I was sadly disappointed. A the few books I have read on his life the beginning of this movie does not relate to the books. The people in the movie are speaking Italian so you have to read the English translation that scroll across the bottom of the whole movie very quickly. I believe they got some parts of the movie wrong for instance a young monk calls Antonio a nightingale but actually it was St. Francis who was the nightingale. St. Francis in the movie is called Francesco. The movie was very short and Antonio seemed to be angry the whole time that he could not be a martyr. They showed very little of his preaching and little of his miracles. They never showed that the Christ Child appeared to him. They left out so much of his story. The dvd is not worth buying. Buy a book about it him to get the full scope of the wonderful saint.
3,yours truly pair by Waterford,"Judging by the previous reviews, I thought this would be a lovely pair to gift. I was a little disapointed with the quality though. It doesn't stand out in any way nor is instantly recognizable as the famed Waterford quality. Priced at 24.99 its not a bad buy, but I wouldn't strongly recommend either."
2,A Guidebook To Giving Up,"My one and only problem with The Awakening is Edna's suicide. It seemed as though she had everything in her reach, and instead of staying strong, she ""wussed out."" I know that this is as close to literary blasphemy as one can come without being burned at the stake, but it's true. This didn't seem so much like a feminist handbook as a rant explaining why women shouldn't strike out on their own: they can't handle it, so they might as well just kill themselves before they make themselves look like idiots. I love the character of Edna."
2,THIS IS A REPRINT - POORLY PRINTED,"I am reviewing the edition of the book: CLASSIC REPRINT. The text is large, and appears to be photocopied. Some of the letters are actually not complete. It reminds me of the old manual typewriters when the letter did not completely strike the paper. I am not reviewing the actual manuscript, as the book was bought for my son's high school class, so I am waiting for him to finish before I read it. But I wanted everyone to know that this particular edition is a bit off as far as the print. My son's teacher and classmates got a good laugh about his book."
2,Good Riddance,"In my opinion, the only redeeming value of this book is the ending (no spoilers...I promise), and I can't imagine why anyone would consider this a proto-feminist work. The heroine is self-absorbed, lacks any sort of marital or parental virtue, and projects her problems onto other people rather than accepting responsibility for her life situation. The only reason I gave the book two stars is that Chopin is an excellent writer, even as the theme is subversive to society and detrimental to sensible feminism."
4,The lost,"The story was beautifully written. The author did not provide any solution to the problem Edna was struggling with. Although I like the writing, the heroine is completely the opposite of independent female. I have to confess that i could not sacrifice myself for my two wonderful boys either. however, so far, I don't have to sacrifice anything. I can understand her abandoning the husband, but how could she leave her children? To me, she is completely lost in her lust."
1,sick. just sick.,"i dont have problems with books that have female heroines. but why is it that in literature, women have to commit adultery to be considered heroines? and why iis she (or hester Prinn from scarlet letter) considered models? why is adultery considered a good thing? what next?"
3,The Awakening,"Edna Pontellier meets this guy named Robert Lubron. Edna adn Robert start going out, and Edna eventually falls in love with him. A while into the relationship Edna tells Robert that she wants to have a baby and that she wants Robert to be the father. Robert doesn't like the idea as much as Edna and he leaves her. Adele Ratignolle gets pregnant and that makes Edna a little sad that Adele gets to have a baby and she doesn't. Adele tells Edna that carrying and having a baby is horrible and that Edna is lucky that she isn't having a baby. Edna is still upset that she isn't having a baby. The next day when Edna gets home from the store she realizes that Robert is back. When she asked him why he was there he told her that he wanted her back and that he was sorry that he ever left her in the first place."
3,too easy,"The Awakening certainly deserves the respect it has gotten for its ground-breaking theme and the skill with which it was written. It's deplorable that a talent like Kate Chopin's was silenced because of the prejudices of her time. That said, upon this my initial reading of this classic, I'm left with the thought, ""what a waste and how unnecessary."" It is true that Edna did not have m uch experience of life/love, but it appears that after her exploration of Edna's gradual discovery of her self, Chopin ran out of ideas and ended Edna's anguish by taking the expected and easy way out. This book could have been so much more had Edna been granted more time to work through her confusion and draw upon her own not insubstantial inner resources. It's difficult to judge something out of its own time and place, but the ending is rather trite and predictable."
2,Pretty craptacular,"I may be at a decided disadvantage in fully appreciating this book, being a man, but I really found this book unenjoyable. The main character, while taking tremendous chances in her ""awakening"", seems to me to be selfish and whiny. I also found the pace of this book to be largely inadequate, as it plods along and never really kept my interest for extended periods of time. All in all, this book fell far below my expectations, judging from the accolades it has received in more recent times."
4,"Ahead of its time, ahead of the pack","A century after the publication of Kate Chopin's novel, its themes -- a woman's awakening to the full potential of her sexual passion and her sense of being smothered by marriage and motherhood -- have become the staple ingredients of 'chick lit'. It is thus easy to overlook how revolutionary and shocking the events and ideas of this story must have seemed at the time. Then, the book was banned from public libraries; now, it is required reading in public schools.In many ways, both in theme and treatment, it resembles ""Madame Bovary"". Although Chopin lacks Flaubert's scope and breadth of vision, she reaches deeper into the soul of her heroine. Her style is restrained and elegant and some modern readers, accustomed to a pacier and more explicit treatment, may grow impatient at times. But there is beautiful writing here, embodying rich characterizations, strong evocations of time and place and thought-provoking moral ambiguity. An undoubted masterpiece."
4,JOSE COLON,"The Awakening by Kate Chopin is a very interesting book to read, with a surprising ending! This book tells me a whole lots of information of how women were in the past. Edna had different responsibilities to do, and that hold her back to become a great wife that she wanted to be. The Awakening is an easy book to read with a lot of details in it, I recommend this book to everyone, especially to do young ladies!"
1,A Very Racist Book,"This book was required for one of my English literature classes (but this is a newer version) in addition to several others when I was in college, and I found it to be very racist. People of African descent have names!! Chopin called the 'black' character The Black Girl, and she made her a maid. All the 'white' characters had names. It is not right to dehumanize people. I didn't care for any of the 'white' characters. My focus was on The Black Girl since I, too, would be seen as 'black' in that society. I destroyed my copy as soon as the class was over. I blew off my teacher who, by the way, was a caucasian male, just for assigning this book as well some other Eurocentric books in addition to a book by Booker T. Washington, a book that I hated (Up from Slavery)."
3,it's okay,"this book is just very bland and boring and has no purpose. only read it for school, deffinately won't read it again."
4,The Awakening,The story is good but why all the typos? I am assuming that this volume is not put out by a reputable publisher but is one of these free of copyright electronic books. Takes away from the enjoyment of the book that it isn't properly designed and typeset.
5,Successfully reaches the depths of a woman's complexity,"Of all the books I've read in my lifetime, this is one in which the cover has worn most thin. Interestingly, I have a male friend who has read it an equal number of times and we revisit this story quite often as if it were an anchor to our awareness (awakening?) of female sensuality in a restrictive role-oriented society. I highly recommend locating the critics' edition as it comes with sketches of turn-of-the-century etiquette, courtship rules and fashion worn by women of Edna's social class. Despite the cultural changes between 1899 and 1999, today's female is still faced to some degree or other the challenge of maintaining a singular identity while filling the role of mother, daughter, sister, lover."
4,THE AWAKENING FOR THE SOUL,THE AWAKENING WAS VERY INTERESTING. THIS BOOK INSPIRES MANY PEOPLE TO TAKE CHANCES AND DO WHAT THEY FEEL IS RIGHT. EDNA PONTELLIER AWAKENS AND BECOMES A NEW WOMAN IN THIS BOOK WHICH MEANS SHE IS THINKING FOR HERSELF AND SHE WANTS TO BE HER OWN WOMAN. SHE FEELS THAT SHE IS FREE AND HER OWN PERSON. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT STORY FOR PEOPLE TO READ IF THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR OWN IDENTITY AND NEED ALITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.
3,Classic,The Awakening is a novella about a young married woman in New Orleans during the late 1800s who suddenly develops a taste for freedom - to make her own decisions and live with the consequences. An exciting concept only because of the setting. The storyline is really very mild for today's readers.The only thing that makes this underdeveloped novella worth reading today is knowing what era the author was from and the impact it made with her peers when this story was released. Were it published today it would quickly disappear into oblivion.
1,Not a feminist book; Spoiler alert,"Although this book is known as one of the first great feminist pieces of literary merit it actually is in no way a feminist book. The main character, Edna is supposed to be realizing her independence as a person but in fact she is incredibly selfish and self obsessed. She is whimsical and uncapable of forming meaningful relationships. She is trying to escape life and all her responsibilities. She leaves her husband and her children for selfish reasons and seeks only to only talk to people who will entertain her. Edna is a selfish and dim witted character whos inevitable end is fitting. She goes out in the only way that is possible for someone as melodramatical and pointless as herself, suicide."
4,A Statement on Non-Traditional Sensibilities,An interesting portrayal of how non-traditionalwomen seem to have no options. Awaiting themodern day version. Who's going to write it????
5,Great lamp shade,"We bought the lamp shade to go with the nursery decor in our son's room. We love it, and have had no problems with the shade. It looks great on the matching lamp that we purchased. Definitely a good buy."
3,Nice Sunday Read....,"Dear Impostor by Nicole Byrd was nice historical romance. She hires a actor to play her fiancee but there is mix up. This book has adventure, romance and great cast of characters."
1,Not worth your time,"I bought this item after reading other reviews. I own a Acura TL-S with DVD-A system which have received very good reviews on its sound quality. This ""Surreal"" music experience disc plain just sucks. All it is is 5 different poor quality MIDI tracks playing from its unique speaker. The idea is good, but execution is poor. It's not worth owning for any amount of money unless free. All the other reviews are way off and probably friend of friends."
3,the cable isnt durable,"the headphones are ok, they looks cool,they get un comfortable after about 30 mins and the cable isnt very durable"
5,Delicious easy dinner,"A long time favorite at our house. Despite the zesty flavor, even enjoyed by our preschooler! I haven't been able to find this at local stores recently, so I'm thrilled that Amazon carries it. We cut up and brown Opa's Jalapeno sausage before adding to the pasta mix."
5,Beautiful Hair!!,Follow the directions!!! and if you do you will get exceptional hair To get the best result use the shampoo and the conditioner and the gel FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! you will not believe how glamerous your hair looks after styling.Leslie
4,love the color,"I love my changing pad covers. I got 2 of them in pink, and the color is so pretty and matches my daughter's room perfectly. They are a snug fit to my contour pad. I would recommend."
3,"Its just ""OK""","Well, although my sister-in-law who had a baby 1 year before I did told me not to buy these, I didn't listen to her. Like everyone else, I thought these would decorate up the room and provide warmth/comfort to my daughter while changing her. Well, like another reviewer said, it spent more time in the wash then it did on the changing pad. I had bought 2 and there were days when I went through 2 of them by the end of the day because she would have another bowel movement as I was changing her from the first one. And everyone's washer must be different because some say they shrink and some say they don't...mine shrunk to the point where they wouldn't fit anymore. So, these got cut up and are being used as dust rags. Save yourself some time and just use the pad and a wipe to clean up the mess.It got 3 stars because it is not the manufacturers fault that I couldn't wash them fast enough....the 2 star deduction was because of the shrinkage."
1,Shrinks in the wash and doesn't fit!,"Don't bother with this cover because once you wash it, it will not fit the changing pad. Quite a dissapointment because I like the idea of it and the pink color for my baby girl. My advice is to find another brand or don't wash it, which is impossible."
3,I think this works well......,"I have this product and think that it works just fine. I have washed them several times, and although they did shrink slightly, I do not feel it interfered at all with the fit onto the pad. True, the slits are not cut out for the safety straps, but you can still use the safety straps, it just folds up the cover slightly on the end. All in all, not a bad product for the price."
2,Confusion,I agree with others revieuwers about this cd.But there's areason:the songs of the copy are not those indicated on the Amazon reference.I've got this record on vynil with the songs listed by Amazon and...that sure is a five stars record! Be very careful about the material.
4,overlooked but amazing,"this cd kicks serious butt. the first 5 songs are the true keepers but the last songs still have a-ha quality. In my opinion, the one cd other than Hunting High and Low that is a must have."
3,Has Some Good Moments.,"I find Scoundrel Days not to be as good as A-ha's debut album Hunting High and Low. The second album's in the same musical vein of course, it's just that the quality of the songs don't match the first album really. The standout tracks are ""Scoundrel Days"" and ""Cry Wolf."" The rest of them are okay, but don't seem to leave a mark. This is still a good album, but leaves a little something to be desired. Worth a listen though."
5,Do not miss this!,"Yesterday, I found this at the Amoeba, a used record shop in San francsico but didn't pick it up. But today, I had to visit the place again(*_*). It was still there and I couldn't help paying 10 bucks. Their Debut album was really amusing. And then this sophomore effort is even better than that. It seems like they chose the direction of 'train of thought(darker mood!)' rather than 'take on me'. There were some typical 80s' songs and too much of 'dry electric' sound of that time(1985) in 1st album but they improved greatly after that. My only complaint is still about the dry drum sound but rest of it...simply the best of 80's music, isn't it? Among my favorite bands like UK, Camel and Colosseum II, I naturally put early Duran Duran, Kajagoogoo and A-ha. Ok, pop can be art, too. If you can find this, do not hesitate!"
5,Well written and well researched!,"I only read the preview online, but from what I have seen of this book is it both well written and well researched.The 1960s (and postmodernism) was essentially a reaction to the previous decade (when modernism dominated) and Marianne DeKoven puts this well in context.I would like to read the book more fully sometime and review it on my blog Feminist Truths. If you read this Marianne DeKoven please get in touch with me. :)NOTE: I also recommend IGNORING David Williams review of this book because he is clearly just trying to sell his book. (If Amazon was moderating the reviews they would remove his for being a flagrant advertisement for his own book, but sadly they don't moderate very much.)"
5,A Teacher's Survival Guide,"As a teacher of language arts for 30 years I could not have survived without this book, which is periodically updated. It has been my bible for teaching language arts and given me not just techniques, but enthusiasm and energy for teaching. My students have certainly profited due to this volume. My most academically-talented students (based on standardized tests), who can be the most critical of a teacher, and who are now in senior high school and even college have chosen me FOUR times--an accolade as rare as hen's teeth--as THE ""teacher who made a difference,"" to be placed in WHO'S WHO AMONG AMERICA'S TEACHERS. I certainly owe much to co-authors James Moffett and Betty Jane Wagner, the latter who has written many other books for teachers.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"
5,One of the most productive investment books written,"Regardless of an investor's time frame, day trader to occasional, the wisdom will make them more profitable. Rarely does an investment book make one both a better person and more profitable at the same time. R E McMaster reminds us that the whole person, skill and soul, must be in synchronization to be successful at trading and investing and life. He has written one of the best investment books of the 1990's."
3,Inventory of Emotions,Valuable for covering a very wide range of emotional challenges one faces when attacking the markets. Plenty of advice on how to begin to make the character changes that'll help you cope with all those storms. Vailliant reconciliation of seemingly opposing principles by means of a not- inconsiderable amount of new age energy flow ideas.
5,A simple Man!,"A simple man coming to your town! Amazing how many lives he can touch, and disturb! How people are drawn to him! Incredible! A modern Jesus, accepted and rejected, again.Love to all and may God bless you and keep you..."
5,SUPERB OFFERING FROM A CLASSY LEGEND!!,"After one listen, this project, which won two grammys is on my list of all time favorites. Loretta holds no equal when it comes to being innovative and instinctive as an artist. Hers is a true talent backed with unpretentiousness!! From the haunting ""Van Lear Rose"" and ""Miss Being Mrs Tonight"" to ""Portland Oregon"" and all the rest of the fine tunes on this exceptional collection, this CD is worth every penny!! Loretta is the real thing!!"
5,A Real Gem,"I'm just going to echo everyone else's sentiment. I'm not a Country music fan by any stretch of the imagination, but this album is amazing! Honestly, I cannot understand why anyone wouldn't love this record. It's going to be an instant classic, and hopefully it will appear on jukeboxes everywhere!"
5,Good ole Home time music,"Jack White does some of the best stuff when he's not crashing around with his electric guitar. On Van Lear Rose he is in the background. These songs are amazing, yet simple tales drenched in the homestyle fixin's of the purest roots rock. Lynn's voice lends very well to the genre of music that White helped bring to the table. Aiding in the roots feel to this album is the fact that everything was recorded very fast and seldomly recorded more than once. It's rough without being sloppy. a la the White stripes. Incredible!!!"
3,And the award for most overrated cd of 2004 goes to...,"First off, let me just say that KLF and Tammy Wynette pulled off a similar experimental foray a lot better than Jack White and Loretta Lynn. Critics are gushing over this collabaration, but I find it mediocre at best. ""Family Tree"" and ""High on a Mountain Top"" are quite good. ""Story of my Life"" , ""Mrs. Leroy Brown"" , and ""Have Mercy"" are worth a second listen. But the disc as a whole is an ultimately forgettable experiment."
1,Van Lear Rose Wilts,"I have been a Loretta Lynn fan for years so imagine my surprise when I purchased her new album ""Van Lear Rose"" after hearing all the rave reviews and couldn't believe what I heard! The album is a totally ill-produced mess, with Lynn seeming so out of place in nearly every tune. The sound is just awful, despite Lynn's usually competent vocals, and the backup band fights her at every turn. I wish these songs could have been produced by someone who could hear! Owen Bradley would have just laughed or cried. I'm not sure which. No comparison to White. And I can't beleive Loretta could have heard the final result without screaming ""NO! This jus' don't work!)"". Sorry,kids, but for me it really sucked the big one and I got totally got taken in by my faith in her integrity as an artist.The rose has wilted and died."
1,Disappointed in this purchase,"This DVD was very disappointing for several reasons. The main character (a boy) was contentious toward his father on several occasions, yet received no real correction for it and showed no sign of repentance. Several children meet up at night without any parental supervision on different occasions, and at one point two of the boys get into a brawl. I honestly could only handle watching about 30 minutes of this and had to turn it off. I would not show this DVD to my children because of the ill fruit it might produce in their character. The portrayal of Jesus and his disciples seemed much more on track with what I was looking for. Again, I did not watch the entire DVD, so it's possible that things improve with the children, but I wouldn't waste my time waiting to see."
5,Wonderful movie,This movie tells in a simple but moving way the story of Jesus. It's told through children's eyes but not in the corny way some stories are. The movie is very sincere and touching. GREAT!!
5,My 2 year old LOVES this DVD!!!,"Our 2 year old LOVES this DVD so much, that I had to order another Yo Gabba Gabba DVD, just so I didn't have to keep hearing the songs from the first one!! ;) My son watches it over, and over, and over again. Great songs, that he has learned, and sings along with. Highly recommend, to children that love music, and being entertained by DVD's (good for parents that need to get a chore done, while they watch, too ;)"
1,rating,There were scratches & it was difficult on it so we can't watch it. :(There were also damages on the DVD case. I wish it was in better condition.
5,A terrific read,"A terrific read, when I reached the last page I felt that I had been throughly entertained. Remarkable plot twists, a true mystery and puzzle where things really are not what they appear to be. As a man I can say that the author certainly created some unforgettable scenes. This is destined to become a film. Sharon Stone where are you?"
1,Just terrible.,"Okay, let's get something clear, for starters, I bought this pen because I had a dollar or two to waste. So, that said, It should be pretty clear how my expectations for this product were. However, I assumed this would be a pen that was semi-functional at least. I didn't even get that. What I got was junk shaped like a pen. Worthless, not even worth a penny."
3,"So much fun, I couldn't hang onto it.",I had a lot of fun w/this and so did everyone who tried it. Soon it had passed through so many hands I lost track of it.
2,I didn't Like it.,This pen doesn't shock at all and the battery weres out. Also it is very low quality. I do not recommend this.
1,French Communists?,"French Communists and the Nazis ???? It's just a cheap propaganda movie for Capitalist believers, 15 languages :), just send a mail and the producers will send you the movie..."
3,gets it partially right; therefore suspect,"Finally an outright condemnation of that awful quartet - Marx Engels Lenin and Stalin - along with those other admirers of genocide in the service of creating a monstrous utopia - Hitler and his gang of killers. But why stop there? Why even begin with these characters? Why do we leave out the originators of concentration camps meant for wholesale slaughter - ethnicide, genocide, etc? Who are they? The Turks! They ethically cleansed over 4 MILLION Christians between 1915-1923 - 4 million in such an awful haste! Lenin was present and supportive--Hitler was awed...in fact why is NOTHING mentioned in this documentary about the Turkish-German-Soviet alliance to utterly destroy any remnant of Christianity in Asia Minor and in the Soviet Union? We know about the Jews, we know about kulaks in Ukarine, but the word Christian does not come up once! And it was first and foremost Christians that the Nazis, the Communists and the Muslims were wiping out."
4,A little thicker than 1 inch,"The depth of this thing is slightly deeper than 1 inch I believe. When I was trying to put this thing in, it was a very tight fit. I literally had to do several karate chops to get it in."
4,Great piece of history,This book is written by a Harvard lawyer about his experiences as a young man aboard a sailing ship in the 1830's. It is a fascinating piece of California history as well as a firsthand look at the life of a sailor in the early 1800's. It is extremely well written and includes a final dissertation about the powers of the captain and the rights of the common sailor.
4,Great historical book,Great piece of history. Changed my perspective on California and who held it before the United States.
3,Beautiful Story - disappointing illustrations,"It's only been 8 years since Estonia and the Baltics as a whole have been mapped for Americans.Therefore I find it unfortunate that the drawings, especially of Elinda, do not resemble the ethnic types found in the Baltic region. The illustrator seemed to have had little or no knowege of Estonian history, traditions, folk art, costumes, and Baltic types, important, if we want to use this lovely story as a teaching tool, bringing geography and culture together."
2,"Halfbaked ""joke book""","So of course reading some of the English-mangling examples is damn hilarious. Also, I do believe that some of them are real. Unfortunately, no real source is ever given - which is very strange, considering that the authors usually say they personally ""saw"" or ""encountered"" those linguistic catastrophes. A shame, as some graphical proof would have greatly enhanced the reading. Thus, the overall effect is like reading one of those horrible ""joke books"" which collect everything your most hated uncle though funny to say at family dinners. No real value for linguistic fans."
5,Permanent Member of Your Cook Book Collection,"I purchased this book on the advice of a friend. I am glad I took her advice. I love the way the book is laid out by ingredient and then one section titled ""Holidays"". Every recipe we've made so far has been a hit...black and white cookies, banana bread, Mother's Day passion fruit pound cake. Not only are the desserts all delicious thus far, but the directions are easy to follow. My only complaint is that there are photos of a select number of desserts in the middle. There is not a picture for each recipe.This book is a staple for any cookbook collection. It has such a good selection of desserts that if you were going to own just one dessert book, I would definitley choose this one. I think it makes a great gift for anyone who likes to bake too."
4,an intriguing family saga,"The story of how John Stevenson and Nora Feller meet, fall in love, and build both a business and a life together, running parallel with the tale of newlyweds Walter and Arabella Thornton and their more troubled marriage. A fascinating look at the lives of both the rich and the poor in Victorian England."
3,small office,"For a small office, this copier is a grear value at this price. The replacement cartrige and toner are pretty reasonable, we print about 100 pages / month and it has been working for about 1 year now. Only have to change the 2 in 1 toner once."
3,printer = good ; cartridge cost = bad,"I bought this copier for a song, and I was very excited about it. I teach, and my school limits the number of copies I can make on the copier in my building. I often meet the limit very early in a semester. So adding the Canon d340 to my office has been a great help.Everything went well until the toner ran out. It was only then that I discovered that an official Canon replacement cartridge costs almost as much as I paid for the copier!I resorted to the ""compatible"" market, buying two toner cartridges that, together, cost less than 40% of what one Canon cartridge cost. Alas, when I tried to install those so-called ""compatibles,"" they didn't work in the copier.I'm not finished trying out the compatible cartridges, but I'm bummed. What had seemed like a pretty low cost for ""academic freedom"" is now turning out to be, at least, a hassle and, at worse, a very expensive hassle.Beware."
4,A GREAT PRINTER AND COPIER.,A GREAT MACHINE. WORKS GREAT EVERYTIME. TOO BAD IT DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF SCANNING A DOCOMENT AND SAVING IT ON YOUR COMPUTER.
5,Review,"The process of ordering the book, of getting the book on time, and the book being in great condition is awesome. I personally did not have any problems."
2,Not enough coverage,"The pluses - it was comfortable, reasonably priced. The minus was that it did not cover enough of my thumb to be of use to keep my ""trigger thumb"" from bending - which hurts a lot. I have a small hand, I ordered the small size, but the thumb part didn't extend high enough to immobilize my thumb. I did not return it because after just one day's wear, the stitching was coming loose at the top of the thumb sleeve so I just skipped it. For anyone with this problem, just wrap your thumb with about two turns of that self-sticking bandage wrap stuff that's available in different widths - I use 1"" - and is flesh tone which frankly looks better than a bright blue thing that everyone feels compelled to ask you about. Unless you like that sort of thing!"
4,About using this dictionary for learning Turkish,"Pretty good for a beginner like me. Unfortunately, it is both for speakers of Turkish that learn English, and for speakers of English that learn Turkish. It includes a lot of useless information about English and, consequently, it includes less useful information about Turkish than a dictionary of this size could possibly do. That is why I give it 4 and not 5. Otherwise, the organization and the presentation are excellent."
1,French Poetry for French Students,"This book is irritatingly vague. It may be an excellent book for those who are widely familiar with French and French history, but for anyone who has never studied it before I would not at all recommend it. The explanations of the movements were not often very informative and very hard to understand due to the references they make but never explain. I learned very little from reading this book. It would have been better as a book of poems alone, so that the person compiling them did not have to do any extra work than to copy what other authors had already written."
3,Too expensive,"Nothing special. I got the printer and I need this ink. Nothing special. Very small, does not print many pages. Expensive."
3,fun brass sounds,"I enjoy the CD, but not as much as I thought I might based on the first song from it (the only one that got radio airplay around here). That one is very funky and a lot of fun. I often get tired of the Cd and switch to another style of music half-way through the recording. But it is fun, and provides some interesting combinations of styles."
4,Great Energy...Great Band,"I first was introduced to Cat Empire when they performed ""Sly"" on the Late Show with Letterman. What a fun, energetic band..Lots of great vocals, amazing keyboard play, particularly electric piano, and that horn player adds a great topping to the band..The songs are fresh, with lots of jazz, blues, rock influence. Can't wait for their next CD. A standout group, with a great future."
2,Meh,"Jazz Callendar is an ex-cop with nothing really going for her until James Borden, lawyer, offers her a deal of a lifetime. James offers her a ton of money to start her own PI firm with woman she doesn't know. Jazz is skeptical, of course, because the only catch in the offer is she must go on investigations for obscure, elite society that come is red envelopes.I was not impressed by this book. I think there is great potential for this series but this first book is lacking. I think it could have been a much better story if some things were fleshed out better. The relationships and who or what the Cross Society is could have had more detail.I would like to read the next book in the series to see if the development gets any better but it will not be at the top of my reading list."
5,Uno de los favoritos en casa!,"Este libro se ha convertido en uno de los favoritos de mi hija (2 años) y de nosotros (sus padres) también! Las ilustraciones son muy bonitas, la rima y facilidad con que fluyen los versos te mantiene interesado, les enseña una muy buena lección (compartir), y aprendes colores y frutas de una vez. SUPER recomendado!"
5,go loro go,Ditto what everyone else said. Really nice children's book that my 2 yr old son loves. Surprisingly good message at the end.
4,clearing up misconceptions about user picture,"I didn't buy this set yet, but I have to try to clear up some misconceptions that other users have posted; specifically in the picture gallery. In the photos with notes, the poster says the rings should be all the way ""up"" when they are disconnected. That is false, these are not designed like compressed air fittings where you retract the ring, press on, then release ring to lock. These are designed to be firmly pressed on and lock automatically, without bothering the ring. You only retract the ring to remove it. Its actually a very effective design that I wish I had on my compressed air hoses. It allows for one-handed operation for installing and removing with minimal pressure loss (or refrigerant in this case)."
1,Note: buy either a CK-51 or an LK-51,"LB-51 cannot be used directly with the i70 or i80 printer. It needs the housing that is only available within the CK-51 or LK-51 (of which, the LB-51 is part of those packages)"
5,awsome belt,I bought this belt several years ago and have worn it almost everyday. It was a great buy!!!!! I would buy it again.
5,Just Ducky!,"We checked this one out of the library so many times I finally had to buy a copy. Excellent cut-paper illustrations, a great story, humorous text -- this is one book you won't mind reading over and over to the kiddos."
5,Glade Holiday Apple Cinnamon Value Pack is Yummy!,"I bought the Glade Holiday Apple Cinnamon Value Pack in a lightning deal. Once I got it, it smelled so great and I liked the package so much I ordered more for holiday presents. The three products are good quality and the cinnamon essence makes your house (or office) smell marvelous. I purchased for home, work and friends.This was a great deal & the shipping was fantastic as usual."
2,a litlte flimsy,"I found these socks a little thin and flimsy for good work out socks, had wanted some with a little more stretch and ones that fit more snugly."
5,brilliant,"this is a brilliant book for a young adult AND if you're that bit more ""grown"" & wanna remember your childhood, like me! This was always one of my favourites."
2,"joan didion, no she is not!","This is not a great book and it's barely a good book. The first chapter is captivating: a widow re-emerging from the shock and just trying to live day to day. Then it degenerates into a Desperate Older Housewives using terrorism as a convenient sideplot. If she'd stuck with the first chapter and gone from there, it would have been decent. Don't waste your time on this one. I want to smack everyone but the old lady upside the head. And then even she goes idiotic. UGH!"
1,dont trust seller,"I dont know whos idea of good shape is a defective product. First of all the box had more then a few scratches,it's falling apart. And second of all 2 of the disc are super scratched. I used to be a manager at a used video store so let me give you some advice, when a scratch goes in a complete circle that is considered a defective disc, there is nothing you can do to repair those. My biggest mistake is I didn't start watching the box set until yesterday so its probably to late to return."
4,who doesn't love Seinfeld?,"The only problem I have with this set is I want more features, more inane trivia on Jerry, like clues to the Superman references and its origin."
5,"Best Sitcom There Was, There Is, and There Will Ever Be !!!","I don't know what the delay is but I think it's more about politics than worrying about people buying. What stand out about Seinfeld is that he keeps his jokes clean with a high level of creativity. I think Seinfeld's audiences are higher class (and I'm not speaking of money term) than let's say Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, and Chris Rock type. Really, I don't see the humour in farting at the family dinner table like in the movie ""The Nutty Professor"". I love DVDs, and so far I have all five seasons box set of The X-Files. I'm waiting for the Seinfeld box sets. Let's face it, people like Seinfeld more than Friends, and they all ready have their 1st season out. I think people watch Friends because they want to see Jennifer Aniston, not because they find it outrageously funny."
1,Enough Already!!!!,"This is without a doubt one of the dumbest most overrated shows in the history of television. All the characters do is repeat the same lines over+over again. Larry David needs massive amounts of serious therapy. Michael Richards is 20th rate Robin Williams+the rest of the cast is just as bad. Basically the 4 main characters are narcissistic,self absorbed whiners who the planet would be better without. I would give this 0 stars if I could"
1,Disappointed ...,"Dear Sir or Madam,Have been very disappointed to have to pay 24,15 of customs taxes at my post office when I did pick up your package.Plus, I can view the cds on my dvd reader, neither on my computer ...What should I do?Yours FaithfullyRichard Palumbo"
5,Seinfeld on DVD,"I've been waiting so long for Seinfeld to come out on DVD surely we won't have to wait much longer? the best sitcom by far a superb cast with hilarious inter weaving storylines that kept us hooked week in week out, althoguh I have every episode on tape the quality on DVD would be a mouth watering experience."
1,Skip the early seasons,"Skip the first couple of seasons, they're terrible. The jokes aren't that funny and neither are the actors. Kramer is barely the Kramer we recognize him as later. Seinfeld is a show about nothing, and nothing is exactly how much money you should spend on these dvds."
3,"Old Seinfeld episodes, still funny",The set arrived promptly and was all that it had been advertised to be. The DVD's were clean and the case in very good condition. I have not yet watched them all but everything appears good. I'm happy.
5,Seinfeld on DVD-It's been too long,"For all of the Seinfeld lovers out there, our day has finally come. I have 9 VHS tapes of Seinfeld, that I taped while it aired, that are wearing thin. So, Seinfeld on DVD would be great! Plus there have to be hours of out-takes that we haven't seen. Please vote to release the series on DVD."
5,why isnt this on dvd yet?,"lets just face the facts--seinfeld is the best comedy of the 90s, one of the best television comedies ever. period. castle rock, nbc, jerry s, whoever owns the damn rights to this show--please, what are you sitting on your hands for? release it on dvd!"
3,Seasons 1 & 2 Are Not the Best of Seinfeld,"Seinfeld grew to be one of the best comedy shows on TV, but it isn't hard to understand why it originally struggled. During the first two seasons the actors were still trying to define their roles and many of the episodes were slow paced, tended to mope, and the actors often had a whiny dialogue delivery. By the end of season two, and the Chinese Restaurant episode, the characters were getting better and the show was starting to take shape. Probably the best part of this DVD collection is the ""Making of Seinfeld"" extra. Don't get me wrong, I think Seinfeld is great, but seasons 1 & 2 pale in comparison to the middle and later years of its stay on TV."
1,dont purchase,this product dont work with verizon phone as advertised makes no sense to return the item it cost more to return than to purchase so you can call this one a domation of your hard earn cash.
3,"Good price, didn't work very well for me","The price of the product was great, however.... I used it on indoor/outdoor carpet in our basement that had been peed on several times by our cat (new stains, not old). I used an entire bottle and followed the directions and although the pungent cat pee smell isn't as strong, there is still a really funky smell from the cat pee/product - nearly 3 weeks later. Our basement is dry, so it isn't due to moisture. We had friends over and asked them if they could smell it and they immediately said yes - it was a pretty strong smell and the product itself smells like ""cat"". So, now my next step is to spend $$$ to have the carpet professionally cleaned. I might use this product on a very small pee spot in the future, but I think I'll spend more $ on a professional veterinary strength product next time I have a larger spot since trying this cheaper product is costing me more in the long run and it still smells offensive."
2,The French Revolution Obscured,"I'm quite surprised at the uniformly favorable reviews of this book. If a history is even mildly engaging, it keeps my interest. But here the author assumes too much and gets side-tracked in banalities and superfluous detail instead of succinctly telling the big story in a ""very short introduction."" I didn't finish it or pass it on, which is rare for this lay historian.Another example of the futility of trying to find a short-cut to an understanding of historical events. Your better off reading fiction (Tale of Two Cities) than this muddle."
4,Short but Detailed Overview,"Doyle provides a very compact and dense summary of the French Revolution. He summarizes the causes which started the revolution, the events which happened during the revolution, and the effects it caused, some of which have reverberated down to the modern day. The short chapters make the book easy to read in a few sittings, and the chapter titles give the reader the direction for the chapter (Why it happened, how it happened, what it ended, what it started). Doyle mentions all the key players, political parties, and the international incidents the revolution impacted.Also included is a very detailed timeline, a note on the Revolutionary calendar, and a nice selection of suggestions for further reading. As always the Very Short Introductions pack a heavy punch in spite of their small size (this one is just 100 pages). This book was loaded with good content and included a scattering of images throughout the book."
5,The French Revolution: A very Short Introduction,The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction. The book delivered in good time. A very scholarly book and I recommend it for all who love history
1,Initial DVD players suck. Broken with in days or weeks. very bad manifactor. mde in china stinks. sub standard parts. dead ones,"I have this item from a local dealer on Dec 29,2008 and it dies with in weeks. the DVD's spins out of control. also it scratches DVD""s. Its made in China and I hate it. any high tech stuff made in China and Taiwan. I refuse to buy it. I got two HP Compters Dead.c One hell of expensive top of the line 939 ASUS motherboard SLI 32 Deluse. Dead. and then Fed Ex killed it buy througing it over the appartment bulding to safe time. Gees make a appointment! PSP also dead with in 2 days, ther is no service plan for SCEA any more. I am sick and tired of made in China and made in Taiwan. my X-mas bonus was spent on this. initial DVD player.! where is the service on Initial? I tryed calling. No answer"
3,Great unit- some features need explaining,"Bought unit yesterdayImpressed w/ screen quality. Plays my DVD's -R, +R, -RW. AV in/out is wonderful (not found in many units)Has many buttons on unit, not remote.At first USB port froze when connecting an outside source (I tried 3 types). Went back to CompUSA: Same Freeze problem! Initial was no help. Since I don't give up easily I tried again w/ Compusa geek: found out that large files (3MB pictures from a Canon 20D)freeze unit but if you reduce size of pix to 100-300KB the player works beautifully. I now use it at home as a Digital picture frame, showing 100's of pics flawlessly and in continuous mode!!Except for Initial's support I would change rating to 5/5 on my edited review on the basis of quality of unit."
5,::Action Script:: The next step,"Through years of practice and even training from the man himself Robert Reinhardt, I have to say this book is extremely under priced for the amount of information I have learned from it. Bravo to Rob & Joey for putting together one of the most informative books on ActionScript. With this book and lots of trial and error I was able to ace my Flash Developers exam and again, thanks to the authors. If you are considering taking the next step into Flash and really looking to learn just how far you can take this program, this is the book for you!"
3,Not too bad!,"I got this one expecting it to be a little more complete. Definitely had some very worthwhile chapters and helpful information and guidance. However there were consistent and nagging errata. It would have been nice to see this book get slightly more advanced (considering it's concentration just on actionscript and it's huge length), and thorough in widely practiced areas such as PHP."
5,How Did We Get Here ?,"If you'd like to gain an appreciation for a female perspective of the civil rights movement, this is a book for you. I was born in 1957 and came of age during a time when the equal rights struggle for all Americans came to the fore---people of color, gays & lesbians, female--were trying to gain a voice in society. Ms. Height speaks plainly of her involvement in projects that brought about fundamental changes in society. She relates her stories about change as it really happens: one person at a time, one family at a time, one small community at a time. Read and learn !"
4,Hard to find? Not really.,"The material on this cd is available at a ridiculously low price on a 4 cd Tal Farlow set from Germany. Search Amazon for Tal Farlow Quadromania. The first cd of the set is these sessions. The other 3 cds are tracks which are also on the earlier cds of the Tal Farlow Mosaic box set. If you are interested in Tal Farlow and you don't have either the Mosaic set or this material, check out Quadromania. Even if you do have the Mosaic set, check it out, because these sessions used to be difficult and expensive to obtain.There are many other 4 cd sets of jazz and classical material. Search for Quadromania and see what gems are available."
4,good up until the end,"This was a good book, something i really hadn't got to read about too much. And it was really good, but some things just can't be ignored. Like, why Papa didn't send for mama, or the terrible rushed ending. But it is a good read if you are willing to overlook some things and make up your own ending. It really does have good intentions."
3,Bigger Please!!!,I had read in some reviews not put in dryer on high so I took precaution when washing and drying this item. It isn't big enough to begin with for average changing table pads but when you wash this cover it becomes even smaller. I have to stretch it over the pad and it's so tight that it forces the pad to buckle. Eventually after using it like this the pad will start to flatten out. Why I gave this item 3 stars instead of 2 was that my baby really loves hanging out on the baby changer and I assume it is because of this comfortable fabric. We have 2 changers one with this cover and one without in which we use a blanket and the baby loves the one with the pad cover. If they just made this pad cover slightly bigger it would be perfect but otherwise it could be useless if you shrink it.
2,The Mysteries of The Black Middens,"Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates. They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine. This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's. They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens. They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpaThe dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said. He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything. I didn't really like the end of the book that much. I thought the book was a little pointless. The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere. Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life."
3,Cheap sound quality,"Please be aware that this ""import"" CDCatching the Sunis actually out of Canada and is on Unidisc Music Inc's label!!!While Unidisc has some hard to find CD's, notably 70's & 80's dance music artists, sound quality isn't One of their strong points. If you're ever listened to a Unidisc CD you'd very quickly ""hear"" what I'm talking about. Their CD's tend to sound flat, thin, and lacks range & space. This CD is no different. I've a few Unidiscs titles myself - Musique's Keep on Jumping, Gino Soccio's Outline, the Best Of Voyage to name a few so It's not like I don't have a clue.If you're looking for the Import versions of these CD's, look Japan or Europe.... not Unidisc of Canada. And this CD does not sound any better than the ""American"" release.SorryBTW this review also applies to the Unidisc version ofMorning Danceas well.3 stars for sound quality5 for the Music itself."
5,flora da reserva ducke,"for the longest time in tropical biology there was the disctinction between botanists who nneded flowers to id a plant and the locl natibe woodsman who could do so by smelling the bark or looking at the way sap ozed from a small bark cut. This extraordinary compilation by 13 ultra-experienced authors allows anyone with a modicom of botanical grounding to work the forest like a woodsman - no flowers required (a real boon when so many plants flower very seasonally).Superbly illustrated, with sensible keys and pointings out of the kind of fine but useful disticntions onlt the true expert would know, this ground-breaking guide can be used throughout the Amazon basin. A must for anybody comtemplating any kind of biological fieldwork in Amazonia that involves any plant component"
1,You wont learn much just by reading,You wont get rich by reading this book. It takes real world experience to start making money. Be prepared to fail many times and possibly lose money before making a successfull sale. Talking people into something takes practice. Get a communication book first. Then you can achieve in any businness not just real estate
5,I disagree with the above review!,"As a physician who is interested in real estate investing, I have found this book to be enlightening and enjoyable. It teaches you to ""think outside the box"". There may be a ""win-win"" deal that you can put together by simply using these concepts, which would have eluded you using traditional thinking. For the price of a movie, I have found it much more useful and entertaining. I consider it a ""must read"" for those who are taking their money out of the stock market and putting it into real estate."
4,Good introduction to creative real estate investing,"This book was one of about a dozen books I have read to research creative real estate investing, and it was definitely the most straightforward and practical. It provides a good overview as well as enough details to explain the processes without overloading you with information. It does focus on the purchase-option strategy, so if you are not interested in using that particular strategy in your investing, then this is probably not the right book for you. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone just getting started in creative real estate investing."
5,great book,This is the best real estate book I have ever read.I have a lot of books on real estate and none ever as informative as this one. I have been telling all my friends and associates about this book. All the info you need to start your creative investing with little or no money is right there.Wish I had this book before I spent all that money on the others.With this book you can start your real estate investing now.I am so excited. Thank you for this book.
4,Innovative,This book gives you good practical ideas on how to get started in investing in Real Estate. There are some key items left out that you cannot get unless you sign up for their mentor program. For a beginner in Real Estate investing using Lease option purchase agreements it is a lot to chew. An experienced Real Estate investor will be able to apply these concepts immediately. This book is not for the lazy or faint of heart. If your are a first time investor this book will only take you half way to your goal of getting started. The rest is left up to you.
4,Old Soggy No. 1,I just read Old Soggy No.1 and want to have my own copy. I have a portrait of Slats Rodgers. Reading the book makes the man very real to me. As I read the book I felt that Slats was sitting in my living room telling me all of his tales of early flying. I have read many books on aviation and this has to be one of the best. Very enjoyable reading.
5,Easy Slicing with Zyliss,I bought the slicer for our 90 year old near blind grandma to slice her tomatoes thin and even without cutting herself. My husband tested it out & loves it. We had so much fun we sliced a lot at first. It slices both large tomatoes and plum tomatoes without squishing them and you can adjust it for thick or thin. Orange slices look great and you can eat them without squirting juice all over. I sliced apples & made cinnamon apple bake. It cleans quickly & easily & folds away conveniently - and you don't have to change the blade. We kept the slicer for ourselves and ordered another one for Grandma. She loves it too!
3,"Well, it could have been better...","The strategy guide is outdated, and should be revised for the current issue of city of heroes, the book still refers to the villains ""council"" as Fifth Column, and there are other things that are clearly outdated, it would be nice if Prima would take the time to give us a quality product, all in all, I would say, if there is a marketplace seller with a cheap price on this, go for it, it's been useful, but don't pay full price for an outdated strategy guide."
4,"Edukative, interresting","I did not read the whole book yet, but it is very interresting. It describes the diseases from a unusual, different point of view."
5,Read it to believe it!,"If you are already knowledgeable about homeopathy, this book will give you a clearer understanding of the human body, health and disease, which is essential before you get into the details of Materia Medica.And if you are not, and are just curious to know what homeopathy is all about, and how it works wonders in areas where traditional medicine has miserably failed, then you should hear from the master himself, George Vithoulkas. Let me warn you, you might just get converted!"
3,Mistral's Daughter,"This book is fairly predictable, but it's an enjoyable read. I've read it a couple times. I think I appreciate the glimpse into the world of high fashion, as well as Europe in a long glimpse of the 1900's."
4,"Nice border, really cute","This border is so cute and it makes the nursery look complete. It is sturdy (does not tear easily) however, the directions indicate you should wet it for 15 seconds, however, I would recommend wetting it for 30 to 45 seconds because when we waited 15 seconds it was not wet enough and would not stick."
5,Its what you need to know.....,"I liked this book because it was what you needed to know - nothing more. It had practical examples and ""how-to's"" to get you from the development/coding to deployment. The most useful part (to me anyways) was the gotcha's that I normally spend hours trying to figure out - particularly with IBM products ;) Good book if you want to know the entire lifecycle if WebSphere."
5,"Entertaining, Uplifting Reading","Even though it has been slightly difficult to read this divergent version of the Arthurian legend, the Pendragon series has been an exciting, as well as, uplifting read.Grail is no exception to the premise set up by Lawhead: truth and justice is upheld, while evil is overcome; even though ""Evil"" is like the proverbial Hydra, sprouting two heads each time one was defeated.For those who enjoy a good story w/no bad language or gratuitous, explicit sex Grail is a very good book. I give it 5 stars."
3,Overkill,"Taliesin / Merlin / Arthur. Excellent trilogy, with Atlantis thrown in as a bonus. Pendragon and Grail were written to expand the trilogy, but cover much of the same ground -- overlapping overkill -- with too much religion for my taste, very irritating in fact: much more 'Good News' than I can stomach. The author would have done better to go back and revise the original trilogy, which was self-contained, and shoehorned in the grail elements that are the theme of the sequels.But the political nastiness of kinglets, lords, and bishops is well handled, and the wicked ladies are fun. And Grail has some nice spooky witchcraft in a grim forest in Lyonesse -- in fact one of the eeriest scenes in Arthurian fiction."
4,"Neato, indeed.","This is the perfect thing to keep your daughter's random little toys together. This works for any little dolls or animals, fits nicely on a bookshelf, and is a great portable playmat. It also makes a neat carry-case for a tea-set picnic."
1,Hated It,"I didn't even finish reading this book. It is completely full of things your police loved one COULD POSSIBLY do that is BAD. If you don't have any problems, and just thought this would be a good book to read, don't bother. It'll just give you a million things to 'watch out for.'"
4,Typical Bertrice Small,"Bertrice Small is one of my all time favorite writers. Somepeople complain about the similarity about the story lines. (Boy meetsgirl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl to handsome stranger, boy gets girl again.) I like Mrs. Small's writing because it is different from the typical romances. She is also very detailed and historically accurate. Her characters are very deep and her descriptions are so vibrant. I lose myself in Bertrice Small books every time without exception. This book was your typical Bertice Small book...."
2,Poor transcription,"I am disappointed in the Kindle version of this book. Throughout the first two chapters letters in words are missing, added on or substituted with other letter ie. widi = with, diat - that. With each page I am forced out of the story and into detective mode to decipher some of the text. Very disappointing!"
3,Its really not necessary.,I bought this when I was 8 months pregnant with my now 5 month old son. We used this for a week(if that!) and decided we didnt need it. We just used the bare changing pad and because its kinda cold we just layed a cloth diaper under the baby. Worked fine. This is a quality product though. Like I said I just dont think you should waste the money!
2,These don't fit!,"Great concept, love how they're terry cloth, and you couldn't ask for more color choices... but, after washing them, they don't fit! The corners of my changing pad (and yes, it is the once that's made to go with these covers) are all smashed from forcing it into these covers. Mine are also covered with little lint balls after repeated washings, and obviously a changing pad cover necessitates repeated washings!"
2,Serviceable but not the best pad cover I've seen,"This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it. The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric. The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel. I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though. Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad. You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one. I never used covers with DD and never had a problem."
3,Its ok but for the Simmons name....,"This changing pad cover is ok but am fairly disappointed on the softness, or the lack thereof. For the Simmons name you would think that they would have made it softer. I washed it and also used fabric softner and it still feels like a cheap towel. I ended up getting another changing pad from Pottery Barn Kids for a couple dollars more and its super soft. I now just use this one as a back up in case my son has an accident on the one I prefer."
2,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!,"I really disliked this product. First, once it was washed it shrunk and would not fit properly on the pad. I bought a standard contoured pad from Babies 'R Us and so it should have been compatible. Second, it's too much of a pain to keep taking it off, washing it and putting it back on. I have three of these and now don't use any. If your baby remotely spits up or goes to the bathroom while on the changing table (before you get a new diaper on) I've found it's easier to buy some nice inexpensive matching towels and lay them over the pad. They're cheaper and you don't have to worry about fit."
2,Bought & Returned.,"This cover is soft terry cloth, but we bought the safety changing table pad deluxe by Dex Baby Products and you do not need this item (we returned ours). If your baby ever has an accident while you are changing them, you will end up washing more then you should have to. We just use the pad which is vinyl & easy to wipe down after changing."
1,Terrible product!,"The quality of this changing pad cover is very, very low. After only one washing, I had loose threads all over and the terry had already snagged. Now, after months of continued use and turning a blind eye to all it's imperfections, the terry material is pulling away from the elastic edging. The Especially for Baby brand changing pad cover is so much better: MUCH softer, better made, comes out of the wash perfectly, doesn't get snagged by bibs with velcro closures that are also in the wash. I had two Simmons covers and both are terrible. I'm buying another Especially for Baby one immediately."
1,"Before washing, okay. After washing, terrible.","I tried this cover on before I washed it and it fit perfectly fine. After I washed it and tried to use it, it had shrunk at least 1.5 inches in length. Terrible product..."
2,i'm afraid to wash it anymore!,"This is an attractive cover, but oddly, it's way too hard to get on the pad it's designed for. The first time it was difficult to put on, but looked ok. After repeated washings, it's getting worse and is bending my changing pad. the ends are all smushed down. What a bummer."
1,Very Dissapointed,I received the aluminum pitcher and it was dented and smashed when it arrived. I do not know if it was how it was packaged or that the delivery company handled it improperly.I will send it back for a refund.
1,Warning,"I've given this a low rating simply to catch attention to the misleading description Amazon gives to this book.The description of the author and the book describes this as a ""novel"" written by a woman who chose to be anonymous.In fact Mourt's Relation is not a novel and is the first description of the 1620 settlement in Plymouth by the Pilgrims. It was written by one of the first settlers in Plymouth.Read it for history, not for romance fiction."
5,fun gift,"I ordered this for my nephew's birthday since his Dad is a disc golf player. My nephew was turning one but I figured with appropriate supervision he could play safely with this toy. As soon as we set it up he got a disc and went over and dropped it in the basket. It is the perfect size for a toddler, be aware the package says for older children and adults. This was the exact size I expected but could see that someone wanting to use this as a family activity might be disappointed. That said my brother-in-law thinks the gift was for him and uses it in the house even though he has a full size basket in the backyard. It is not built to last forever, but should last long enough to get my moneys worth."
3,Looked Great,"I bought this for my wife and she wasn't very happy with it. It was very easy to use and the display using the IPod is a great idea, but... The FM signal was very weak and the size wasn't as convient as I thought it was going to be. She went back to using the ""Griffin Technology 9781-TRP30BK iTrip FM Transmitter with LCD and Dock Connector for iPod"". I think this was a great idea that missed the target for us."
3,Does it's job with a few problems.,"For the price this was the best FM transmiter I could find. The connection between the iPod and the iTrip sometimes comes loose resulting in lose of sound quality. Also, the click wheel on the iTrip is sometimes very touchy and sometimes the hardest click wheel I've ever used. Over all it's a good buy for anybody who doesn't have the luxury of hooking up your iPod directly to your stereo."
3,its ok for the price,For under 20 dollars this is one of the cheaper fm transmitters for ipod nano from griffin. The sound quality is fair. Its difficult to find a free fm channel in the bay area but that problem is with all fm transmitters. The fm transmitter is very easy to use.On the down side the ipod and the fm transmitter do not couple together very well. there is some lateral movement. Battery consumption is on the higher side. If you play and charge the transmitter with a 12 volt car charger there is a constant humming noise.Outside the bay area the results are much better.
1,Low Quality Rip Off,"I purchased this for my Acura TL since I wanted to listen to podcasts and music for the short term ... while for the long-term, i debate spending hundreds of dollars on a real ipod to car link.To my dismay, the quality of sound of even audio lectures are crappy! There's tons of static and you have to crank up the volume high.Now imagine what it sounds with music. Man it's horrible, it's like hearing hold music over the phone. It's WORSE than radio station music.I wish i could return it, but i exceeded Griffin's strict 30 day return policy. Woe is me. I'd resell it on ebay or craigslist, but i'd feel guilty to sell such a crummy product."
2,"Does not fit, but would be a great product if it did.","It states in the review that it is for the 1G nano, but in the product manual it states it should fit the 2G Nano. It does not. It would be a great product if it did, I think, because I am quite satisfied with Griffin products, and it is a very slim design.I also think it would have been great at preventing the transmitter from breaking off, which, has been a concern with those that simply insert into the bottom or top of the iPod.They were really great about returning it, though, so no harm done, I suppose. Loss of shipping costs to return it."
2,works everywhere EXCEPT in my car!,"amazing product. easy to use and sounds great. too bad i can get these results everywhere EXCEPT in my car which is where i bought this item for!Obviously the problem is my car stereo, but its the principle.otherwise this is a great product with no real drawbacks other than it seems to really drain the nano's battery power fast. another no-no for a product whos main features are for use in car without external power.2/5 stars."
4,Very Good Cookies,These cookies are very good ... brought back a lot of good memories as a kid when I ate these on a regular basis.
1,Totally Disappointed for a Second Time,"This Goblet is advertised as a 10-1/4 oz Goblet. IT IS ONLY 8oz IF YOU FILLED TO THE TOP! I can forgive for sending wrong item the first time and they were good about crediting my account but never gave me an explaination. I still wanted the OVERSIZED GOBLETS so I reordered. Guess what happened next... What gets my goat is they are still advertising them as 10-1/4 oz! Glassware is Beautiful but I WANT THE OVERSIZED 10-1/4oz GOBLET, PLEASE!!!!!!!!"
1,Excellent Video but Sloppy Audio Work on DVD,"It was my first time to watch the Disney-rendition of this movie. Overall, it was fun and exciting to watch; especially recommended for kids...just don't encourage them to go near a gorilla, though. The video technicals were as awesome as I expect them to be (two thumbs up!). Somebody in the recording studio made a sloppy sound recording on the DVD, though: (a) No sub-woofer recording (WATCHOUT, it's only 5.0 and NOT 5.1) (b) Some left and right sounds were mixed-up. I'd recommend this only for the curious and not for the serious DVD collectors. Otherwise, just rent it."
3,It's an okay movie.,"Though a little sad in places and funny in others, I just felt annoyed Disney is remaking every single movie from the past and making them ""G"" Rated. But hey what can you say when there is a grown man walking around in a small lion cloth and grunting and groaning all the time? lol no one can!"
5,Fab movie,"Grand kids love Tarzan, and so do my adult kids. Great Friday night movie at home. And music is awesome."
4,"A ""should have"" for your DVD collection","In my view, this movie borders the Disney ""Masterpiece"" category. Tarzan has a good story line backed up by a good cast of voices. However, the automated computer animation becomes almost too apparent at times if you are a fan of the more ""hand crafted"" Disney classics. The DVD version has fantastic picture and sound. This movie was definately made to be enjoyed on DVD."
3,The kids liked it more,The kids would give it 4 and 1/2 stars - it had some cute moments but I prefer finding Nemo
1,No Way!,"I rented this DVD for my kids but would NEVER buy any DVD the forces my kids to watch commercials. Greed, Greed, Greed, the Rat strikes again. Oh ya the movie was beautiful...too bad."
3,Not Disneys best,"I was really looking forward to watching this with my son, but I was really dissappointed. The story is somewhat lacking and this is a very violent film, even if it was realistic. Make sure you watch this before your child so you can explain about all the death and guns. I could see where Disney wanted to go with this film but the message never quite becomes clear, especially to children. On a brighter note, the soundtrack is FANTASTIC!"
1,"Disney says it's only 1 disc. A ""Not So Special Edition""","Even though the trailer on the brand new Toy Story 10AE dvd says that Tarzan SE is 2 disc you'll notice only one disc sticking out of the package in the enclosed flyer. There have been many rumors about this & I emailed Disney. The response says that it will be ONE disc (& if you've seen the fact sheet ALL of the great features of the Collector's Edition are omitted). You'll be getting the movie & some short fluffy bonus materials. I don't know why Disney didn't just rerelease the CE with a new cover & some new previews like the A Bug's Life CE but they apparently are not. The only reason I'll be buying this is for the movie since I lost my CE in Hurricane Charley but it is blasphemous to call it a ""Special Edition""."
3,"The best animation yet, but a typical Disney formula ...","The Disney animators beat themselves with each new film: they are the apex of animators throughout history. Technologically adept scenes of CGI trees overlaid with artwork textures give brilliant sequences of Tarzan 'surfing' through the trees. Unfortunately, Disney can't break away from the tired old convention of using pop songs and musical interludes since they make money. The products coming from Disney no longer shape tomorrow, but follow yesterday. The film work was very pedestrian, the storyboards were flat and centered giving a bland side to the cinematography. One star off for the lack of film smarts, one star off for the DVD commercials forced on the unsuspecting viewer (it felt like 30 minutes of previews). Great for kids, adults, anyone, I recommend this excellent animation for all art students, film buffs, and anyone wanting a good 90 minutes of escapism."
4,Grandson loved it,Rented this for our grandkids and it was a hit. It was a good video although an older one. They sat and watched the whole movie. Good buy
1,Tarzan,I found this on line for 18.00 -- thought i would look here and see if I could find it and you have it for 29.99 not a good thing
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"After publicizing this release as a 2 disc set, disney finally changed its mind and released it as a barebones single disc. Those who were waiting to get all those great behind the scenes stuff available previously on ""tarzan 2 disc collector's edition"" will be thoroughly disappointed with this release.However, those who missed out on previous 2 disc collector's edition and want to own tarzan on a two disc set, still have the option of buying it from amazon.co.uk, where it has been released as a 2-disc special edition with all those behind the scenes stuff from previous collector's edition. Just make sure you have a multi-region dvd player which plays discs from all regions.Do not buy this unless you just want to own the film. Better still search for the old collector's edition. It will be worth all the money spent."
5,Disney movie,My 3 yr. old grandson LOVES the Tarzan movies. The movie is fun to watch and I enjoy it as much as he does.
3,Tarzan DVD USED,love this movie so cute for young children as well as families!! My grandson sat there calm peaceful and quiet!! he laughed the whole time over tarzan and jane was adorable packageing shipping and customer service was excellent!! and it came on time although the middle piece broke but thats ok I fixed it no matter what this movie was worth every penny u pay for it!! yes I would reccomend this tarzan movie any day take care kristen
3,Not bad,"it's just one of those Disney movies. Nothing bad, nothing really good.Pluspoints are in the music and the animation, which is Disney's best so far."
5,Loved it!,"The best Disney Movie since the Lion King! Rates right up there with the best, an instant favorite."
1,Awful!,I was extremely dissapointed with this seller. It took almost 2 wks for my item to ship. Then I never got it! It stated it was delivered on Sept 17. I never received it. I also couldnt track down who had signed for it. I had the worse time and then when I tried to contact seller I kept getting automated emails. I paid for a product I never received. I will never do business with this seller again.
4,The man is great,"I heard about this guy and have a friend in LA that swears by him. He's like a low-impact, high-results guy to the hollywood stars. Looking forward to the DVD."
5,PKI Implementation and Design,nicely written and very thorough. i highly recommend this who wants to learn PKI
4,Maryland Book,Excellent purchase. Well pleased. The book was in excellent condition as the buyer said. Very please with the price and the delivery.
2,Too Much about options: an easy way to get confused,"Far too many investment books devote their time and effort to theory, especially for beginners looking to get some help when they make their first moves. This book is no exception. By comparison, Wade Cook's Wall St. Money Machine is full of the hype that makes for easy and enjoyable reading. The reader walks away with some risky but useable tools for trading options - but not the collegiate level comprehension that this book can give.If you want to be entertained, check out Cook, with a grain of salt.If you want to go to options trading college, check out Natenberg or Gallacher's The Option Edge."
5,I know why it is the #1 best selling non-fiction book!,"Marcia Clark did a wonderful job writing this book. Like somebody else said she answered almost all of my questions about the ""defendants"" trial. I couldn't put this book down. She gave reason on why the prosecution team couldn't submit some of the evidence. That was really what I wanted to know and now I do. She also describes growing up! The trial was the biggest of the century and this book is the best of the centur"
4,Very enlightening to hear the real story.,I listened to the audio version of her book. I put on headphones with tape #1 and headed out for my walking exercise. 2 hours later I'm still intently listening (and walking). She puts a lot of emotion into her reading. The events and real story behind the OJ trial is unbelievable. The presentation of evidence and witnesses make it truly amazing that OJ was ever found not guilty. GREAT LISTENING !!
5,Cross-tuning made easy,"I love Marion Thede's 'The Fiddle Book. One of the most useful aspects of this book is that tunes are notated both 'as they sound' and as they are written, if the fiddle was tuned in standard tuning. In other words, you cross tune your fiddle, and then play from the music as if you were in GDAE tuning. Fantastic."
5,Great Relief for Owner and Allergy Suffering Dog,"This Shampoo has been a LIFE SAVER!!! I have a white german shepherd that is allergic to EVERYTHING. He has several food allergies, environmental allergies, and to top it all off he's allergic to humans. We've spent tons at the vet on allergy tests, allergy therapy, special food and pills pills pills. We even bought the vets hypoallerginic shampoo, and he broke out after using it.Immediately after a bath his skin is less red and irritated, and unlike other shampoos he doesn't get itchy from being washed. Its not a cure all for allergy suffering pups. But it definitly helps our dog and gives some much needed relief."
3,Quiet hero scores again,"Glenn Ford does his patented understated hero again, this time as a Texas cowboy delivering prize Brahma bulls in Brazil where he runs afoul of bad guy Frank Lovejoy. But it is Cesar Romero, an actor who once played the Cisco Kid, who steals the show as an aging and comical bandit -- much as we might believe the real Cisco would have become in his later years. Cult director William Castle, of all people, helmed this RKO film and did an OK job."
3,the inner circle,"This was not my favorite Boyle but I am reading everything he wrote so that tells you something. Very interesting and eye opening.It's so enjoyable to read his stories about real people because you can't be too sure how much is true and how much is ""Boyle""."
4,Solid but ultimately disappointing,"""The Inner Circle"" provides a fascinating fictionalized inside look at Alfred Kinsey and the creation of the infamous Kinsey Report, soon also to be documented in a feature film starring Liam Neeson. The story is told through the perspective of young John Milk, a student at Indiana University who goes on to become one of Kinsey's research assistants.The narrative voice is strong, often compelling, particularly in its depiction of the ambivalent sexuality of its central characters, propelled by Kinsey himself, but the long-expected, somewhat inevitable denouement (which should pack an emotional punch) somehow manages to fall short and the story wraps up a little too tidily.Still, this is an entertaining read and a worthy introduction to TC Boyle, whose works I had never read. ""Drop City,"" which I imagine to be a superior book to this, is next on my list."
2,Disappointing,"While Boyle creates interesting characters and the premise of this story has great potential, I was largely disappointed by this novel. I love TC Boyle's short stories, and I've come to expect great things from him, so when this novel dragged on and on, giving the reader no real new tugs to pique our interest, I wondered where Boyle's editor was. Perhaps the writing style and repetitiveness were meant to give the reader a sense of the boredom and monotony that even group sex could come to have for a sex researcher, but I understood that after 200 pages, and this novel could have been half as long. I love TC Boyle, but this would be the last novel of his that I'd recommend."
5,A Classic,I really like this book. Its full of photo's and the recipes are easy to follow. A great treat.
2,What a disapointment...,The metal clips on this product are too thin and they slip through each other. This causes the belts to fall off very easily. The other disappointment is that there was no Browns logo on the flag as the picture shows. I would not recommend this product.
4,Great DVID,I have seen all of the other seasons of this series and this season is just as good as all the others. If you like Canadian humor in an odd setting you'll enjoy Red Green.
3,Not your typical Zane Grey novel,"This novel is set after the end of WW1, with returning veterans. A departure from his westerns,it sheds a different light on what returnees dealt with when back at home. A fresh perspective."
5,Great step choreography & workout,"This is a really good tape for an intermediate stepper. Just a few complex moves, but since Rob's build-up is excellent, there are good alternate moves for less experienced steppers. I never get tired of this DVD and consider it my ""plan B"" when I can't decide what to play."
3,no noticable change,I took these for a year and a half with no noticable change.It may work for some ...just not for me.
5,Great Book,"Best guide book. Written in real language. I didn't agree with everything, but these are real honest opinions, not bogus tourist plugs."
5,Best Oahu book!!!!,"We purchased three books as we planned our honeymoon on Oahu. We found all of them to be dry reading and not very helpful. A friend loaned us this book and we loved it! It has great maps, very useful info written in a humorous style, lots of ""back stories"" on places, sites, restaurants, tourist attractions, etc. We are returning to Oahu next year, so I ordered our own copy. I highly recommend it!!!!"
3,Good but needs updating,Just returned from Oahu. I thought the book good was very nice. It is 2 years old now and needs to be updated if you want specifics. It's a good over view book at the moment. And nature doesn't change much unless there is a disaster (I made this mistake with Louisiana books). Biggest changes have been to the Polynesian Cultural Center. Make sure to get current information. I liked the Atlantis submarine but my wife didn't. I've dived in Belize and can say it doesn't compare. It didn't help the tour person saying that the sand you are looking at one time was beautiful coral with lots of fish. They go on to tell you that it was worse until they started to quit dumping in the ocean. Maybe we just had a candid guide.
5,The BEST Hawaii guidebook,"We were going to spend a few days on Oahu before embarking on a cruise, so I already knew that the book we needed to guide us was ""Oahu Revealed."" We had previously used the Kauai and Maui 'Revealed' books and knew the Oahu book wouldn't disappoint. The authors don't get any kind of kickback or royalties from their suggestions, so one gets a forthright overview of what to do and not do on the island. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Love the book!,I used the Hawaii Revealed book when I visited there several years ago. It was the perfect travel guide because I like the less touristy areas and this book explains all those little secret areas that only locals know about.
5,Oahu Revealed,We have the other Andrew Doughty Hawaii travel books and this one did not dissapoint us.
5,Must have,We had previously gotten the Kuai Revealed and loved it. When I went to Oahu I had to get the book for it too and was not disappointed. This is the most accurate and honest of all the 'travel guides' I have read for any location. The author will tell you 'when the baby is ugly'. It's like a Consumer Reports of travel.
5,Oahu Revealed was a great vacation help.,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about Oahu and found it very helpful in selecting sites and events to visit even though I used an older edition for my July 2010 trip. Hopefully the newer editions are better about including addresses for GPS devices. I didn't agree with every recommendation I followed, but I still think the book was a big help in making the vacation the absolute blast it was."
4,Very useful!,"I loved the book. I got Frommer's and Fodor's and liked this book better. Tip for Wakiki dining... I wish we had gone to eat at Duke's Canoe Club (in the Outrigger Waikiki) the first day. The prices and quality of drinks and food were the best we experienced. Try the Opah (fish) if they have it available and get it made Duke's style. DELICIOUS! Oh and for appetizer, try the crab mac wontons. We compared every place to Duke's after that and no one stacked up."
4,A good tool,Book came quickly. It's good if you like to learn... otherwise it would work better to beat yourself in the face with.
2,Please try again Mr.Rozenweig,"This book is a course textbook for my course, but to be honest I find it badly set out, espacially in the index where it's impossible to find anything. I know the guy's an expert in his field but the relevent information is hard to extract from the very dry tone. I've been tempted on more than one occasion to simply use it as a computer stand. This may sound like any other textbook but when you compare this to Kalat's book of the same name, the difference is unbelievable. As a student I'll take this rare opportunity to say 'good try Mr.Rozenweig, but I think you should take it back and work on it a little more'"
2,I Hated It!!!,"I may be the only person that hated this book and I am fine with that. The message was horrible!!! Really??? This must be a message for athiest or something but I thought the book had the potential to a create a good storyline but failed esp at the end. When I was done with the book, I tucked it under my bed FOREVER. It may be a good for some but not for me."
2,Changes,"This is my 3rd baby. We used playtex bottles with liners for our first 2 kids and loved them! I guess Playtex decided to change their bottle sometime between our last baby and this baby. The liners no longer match up and it's hard to see the numbers. We decided to scrap it all and go with another brand completely, unfortunately."
2,Air goes back in,"I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles). Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price. Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing still"
1,Leaky liners,Playtex makes leaky liners and have caused me to waste more than 10 bottles of breastmilk- sometimes 2 leaky liners in a row. Buy target or other generic brand to save yourself the heartache.
3,Playtex Drop-Ins,"Good idea as I used them before with my son, however, the quality has changed since buying them for my grandson. The drop-ins won't secure as well to the top of the bottle frame and after the cap is on they start to leak. We purchased generic at Wal-Mart and they worked much better. At the reduced price offered at Amazon, I don't feel they were worth the money and the generic ones cost less."
3,"Not bad, but expensive","I bought these for a cheap price on Amazon, but when I ran out I purchased the ""generic brand"" at Wal-Mart for a few dollars cheaper than the Playtex brand, they work just as well, and do the same thing."
5,Kick ass,"Me again, if you've been following the Spirit reviews. These guys (and gal) are amazing and highly underrated. This CD is raw, very live sounding and very traditional. Great if you like the traditional Canadian east coast sound or sort of rootsy scottish music."
3,Disappointing,"I'd read a lot about how prescient Stone was about the drug trade and American involvement abroad, so I picked this book up, excited about a literary author who actually seemed interested in getting the reader's blood pumping. In any case, I was disappointed: I'm not sure how novel this was when it appeared in the 70s, but many of its scenes have become standard cliches of the movies - the torture scene, the bags of drugs, the shootouts in precarious and picturesque locations.Perhaps it isn't fair to criticize a book for how much it's been imititated, but a genuine work of art shouldn't lose much of its lustre just because of mediocre followers, and I found myself genuinely bored by a great deal of Dog Soldiers. The only scene that showed the talent of the author was the surreal conversation between the central character and his slightly crazy mother. I haven't read A Flag For Sunrise or any of Stone's other books, but I'd certainly try those before this one."
3,"Memorable Sci-fi thriller, with good performances","""The Hidden"" is an underrated science fiction/thriller that is actually better than the usual fare. Director Jack Sholder gives the film a kinetic pace, while his camerawork style is equally energetic and eye-catching. Although the film has some dated aspects to it, the performances help compensate for that flaw. As Kyle Maclachlan gives a subdued and endearing performance as the FBI agent with a secret, while Michael Nouri's portrayal of the worn out cop is also enjoyable. Helped by good characterisation and a directorial flair by Jack Sholder, this is a pleasing thriller."
5,Slam Bang!,"A rip roaring scifi/action flick that moves along at a relentless pace and is one of the best of its type. Sure, it's the old 'alien body snatcher' thing, but it is presented with such verve and accompanied by a terrific rock soundtrack (at least for the 80's!), that it really is irresistable fun. A fine job has been done with the dvd presentation and I'm still at a loss as to why this cult classic never got a cinema release, especially compared to alot of the drivel that does. Highly recommended."
2,Just OK,"This is a very beautiful set. When I tried to use it for the first time, I was not able to write even one letter! It did not come with instructions, so I didn't know if it was something I was doing wrong. I looked on the internet to find out how to use the pen. It said to simply dip the pen into the ink and that the pen will write at least a couple of lines before having to be redipped. I have not been able to write even a full word without having to dip it about 3 times."
4,Helps,"Got this for my nearly 10 year old laptop which I thought was not just obsolete, but on its last leg. Low and behold what a little extra memory will do:)"
3,Not All RAMs Are Created Equal,"I confess, I was looking for the lowest price RAM for my Sony Vaio 670 N/C, but failed to do my research. After I installed the RAM to my laptop, the Windows (Vista) Experience Index rated the Crucial RAM a score of 4.8. It's probably not a bad score, but certainly not the greatest either. If you are really looking for a performance boost for your laptop, you may want to consider a faster RAM just for a few bucks more. Otherwise the Crucial RAM works well. Easy to install and worked as promised."
5,Varooooooom,Put this in my again MacBook and it seems like a new computer. this is a good product and at a great price.
5,Muuuuch cheaper than buying Apple's RAM,"I'm a recovering pc person -- I've been an IMac owner for all of four days. This RAM was very easy to install and no problems so far. But best of all -- it was a lot less expensive than buying the upgrade from Apple. There were no instructions in the box on how to install it in the IMac, so make sure you have a printout or a book that shows you how to do it correctly.Crucial's packaging worked well. Don't forget to touch something metal that touches the ground before you open the antistatic packaging."
5,"excellent upgrade, money well spent","Upgraded my 17"" MacBook Pro from 2gig to 4gig. Noticeable performance boost when running multiple applications. Only downfall is slightly less battery life; about 30 minutes less / full charge. However, to me, the increased performance is worth the decrease in battery life. Highly recommended."
2,"Does not work with 2008 MacBook 4,1","2008 MacBook 4,12.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo1 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAMDid not recognize the RAM. I removed it and reinstalled it several times and MacBook would not boot. I put the original RAM back in and MacBook booted as normal.Amazon.com was fair, giving me a full refund."
4,QUOTES ARE GREAT,I love this book. It arrived as promised and packaging was excellent. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the print is VERY small. I have vision problems and even with my glasses and a magnifying glass I have trouble reading this book. The quotes themselves are wonderful. I just wish I didn't have to strain my eyes to see them.
5,Quotable quotes,I love this book! I love all the quotes and sayings. Reader's Digest did a great job with all the different quotes.
4,Works to keep cat from peeing!,"My cat was peeing in several areas for some reason instead of his litter box for months, despite trying everything. We sprayed this and now he uses his box and stays away from the sprayed areas. I will definitely get this again."
5,Terrific AM / FM Head Phone Set,"So glad I ordered this. Have used them all summer doing outdoor projects. In the 20+ years I've mowed the lawn on my little tractor & used headphones, this was the first time I could actually hear the music playing. And it was not because I turned the volume way up high. They are truly wonderful."
4,Nice Headset,Very comfortable and effective. 5 stars if it had a 3.5 mm connector instead of the special one for external audio.
1,DO not buy this piece of crap,This set of radio headphones are total junk. Avoid and do not purchase this product they're not worth $40.00 much less $128.00. There is no radio dial or reference for frequency and they are cheap and poorly made with poor reception to boot.Total crap DO NOT EVEN THINK OF WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK.
3,Lovers And Other Lunatics,"Will not be dull. Enjoy when you need a laugh and love angle. I get all my books from Amazon for they even carry very hard books to find, which are some of the best you would want to read."
3,Daniel's book Review,I want to recommend this book because ti is Non-Fiction.Also its a relly cool book.In the beginning nobody wanted to play with him because he was black.The white people started throwing rocks at Jackie Robinson just because he was black.In the middle people burned crosses for a threat.Then he was picked by his teacher.If you want to know the rest of the story you just have to read the book Jackie Robinson.
2,Ehhh.,"I expected it to be bigger than the picture posted. In fact, I'm pretty sure that the photo is bigger than the item."
5,Classic,"I just wanted to counter the previous reviewer. This book isn't intended as something for beginners, and certainly could only be well taught as a graduate level math course. Still if you're able to take in bits at a time, there's lots of beautiful theory and history of higher dimensional polytopes. A book that takes a lifetime to write can take a lifetime to appreciate, and this is such a book."
3,for the truly dedicated,"i had the good fortune of hearing coxeter speak before he died.he shed some tears and told some fun stories about the good old days with escher.i once owned this book, but not anymore. i don't know where it ended up.not the easy read i was hoping for.i'm sure you'll be able to handle it, though...read cromwell's book if you haven't yet, and also get ""shapes, space, and symmetry."" start small (dimensional)."
3,Press Conference/Store Signings,"I kinda liked this DVD as it shows Michael on a one-on-one basis with his fans. answering questions, giving hugs, touching hands, I found it to be very personal the way he treated his fans. It was interesting to watch him interact with the public. If you personally asked him for something, like a hug, or shaking his hand or asking a question, he was eager to respond to everyboyd's request."
1,"Does not work with ""all brands"" as ""guaranteed","I was impressed by the reviews here and while it seems to work for MOST brands as per the reviews, it would be helpful to know that it definitely does not work with ALL brands as it says on its package/description. Moreover, the customer service is pathetic. Only takes on-line emails, five of which, since December 2008 when I bought the product, have been unanswered. Do make sure before buying this product that it will work with your equipment. Important to know: the model (4110-B00) is not even listed amongst the remotes on its webpage to retrieve codes (http://www.oneforall-na.com/advanced_search.php)"
4,Great replacement,"I use this for my bedroom TV and DVD/VHS combo machine.The codes worked well for the two brands, and the functions work well, although some take a while to get used too. Both the TV and the DVD/VHS players are several years old and the TV remote had died years ago.Very inexpensive and the basic functions are easy to use. Almost five stars."
1,Device does not work,The Universal Remote Control does not recognize Sharpe T/V or Presidion Combo. The codes don't work. Upon calling for assistance I was told that the device I purchased does not receive Tecnical Support.
1,Waste of time,"I tried this remote on a VHS/DVD player,and two TVs.I followed directions for programming the codes. None of them worked.The consumer service web site does not admit there is such a model number."
4,"A Wonderfully ""Bewitching"" Tale...","Although Hoffman's ""Practical Magic"" is most likely her most famous novel, it was ""The Probable Future"" that is easily my favorite novel by this skillful author. In this book, we find a young and rebellious teenager trying to discover her own identity by learning about the generations of ""Sparrow"" women that came before her. Rebecca Sparrow was considered a witch, Eleanor Sparrow can spot liars, Jenny Sparrow is harrowed by the dreams of others, and Stella Sparrow views people dying before it occurs - each women burdened with her ""special gift"" at the tender age of thirteen. In this tiny town of Unity, Massachusetts you see the lives of Eleanor, Jenny and Stella bloom magically, and entwine with the history of their ancestor Rebecca. This book will keep you on the edge, for its not just a thrilling read but also a heartwarming one!"
4,no title,"This is great funk jazz, which says nothing about this music. When people think of funk jazz, that can range from Jimmy Smith to some of the better Rollands band albums of the 90s.The empahsis with Amnesty is funk, but it is funk with complex charts, long, sequatious introductions and many parts through a song. The title track is a great example, and one of the best tracks on the album. This is definately funk, but with an advanced jazz asthetic.\Most of the other tracks on this are as gripping; the playing is just outragious and the singer is among the most soulful I have heard. (If these guys had been more streamlined, they would have been top 40, but I am glad they stuck to their creative impulses.) Not every piece hits a home run, and the album does tend to lose momentum in the middle, but even the lesser tracks are great, and the better ones make this a must have."
1,"WARNING: This is not the official BMG release, but a counterfeit product!","A word of a caution for anybody remotely interested in this material. It was just confirmed that BMG will officially release ""The Complete Million Dollar Quartet"" on Sep.19, 2006. This will feature for the first time ever, the COMPLETE RECORDED SESSION in the ORIGINAL SEQUENCE with 12 more minutes than any other previous release! Stay away from the cheap rehash labels (such as this Charly release), do yourself a favor and seek out the original BMG release when it comes out. The sound quality alone will be superior to anything out there as they've used tapes from Elvis' own archives."
2,well made but...,"This is a well-made Korean horror movie that had lots of potential but it doesn't know when to quit. The idea behind it isn't bad, the setting is great. But it loses all its punch because of an ending that seemingly goes on forever."
5,"Lovely, light fragrance","I ordered this online for a small fraction of department store costs. The perfume arrived very well packaged. Inside the outer packaging, the perfume was in its own orignal box which was wrapped in cellephane. The bottle came with its top on just as pictured here on Amazon; it's exactly what one would get in the department store. This is a fragrance I've worn for several years and I like it very much. I was sorry to see that it has become difficult to find now. I don't care for fragrances that are heavy, too sweet smelling, or linger too long. This one is light, pretty, feminine, not too flowery or strong in scent. I would say it may not last as long as other perfumes do, but I can smell it lightly all day and my husband can smell it hours later when he hugs me."
2,"Good smell, but does not last much",I liked the smell very much and that's why I bought it. But the scent goes away within less than an hour. Not worth the price...
3,"Good, but unclear","Product is great, and delivered in a timely manner. I didn't expect it to be used, even though it said ""TESTER"" on the title. Never the less, great seller!"
5,You won't leave home without it,"I originally purchased the GPS to use with my jet ski with the option to use it for navigtion around town as a secondary function. Seadoo designed special glove boxes to flush mount one of these units due to their superior waterproof ability to handle the wet environment experienced in skiing. However the City Navigator software coupled with the portable GPSMAP series provides an even more incredible combo worth far more then the dedicated units in my opinion. Overall it is very easy to transfer tracks from the unit to record fishing drifts and plot waypoints and routes on your computer for download into the GPS handheld. Instead of printing google maps, I use the mapping software to create waypoints and routes to all my destinations."
4,Great purchase,I waited several months for this to available at the right price. The condition was good. I am pleased.
3,nice song but it's just cookie cutter,"it's the kind of r&b; song that sounds like everyone else's r&b; music and the kind you'd hear in a commercial for burger king or somethingThis song reminds me of something mya has done before, janet jackson has done before, destiny's child has done before and usher has done before. For someone who writes all her songs and has sold so many albums, she is far from original though she has a nice voice. I was hoping she would release a ballad from the album instead and not this generic r&b; song."
2,"Dinky&Corny,but Catchy",i find myself doing the Shake it off dance like if I'm eating french fries&I got the Salt Shaker I be shaking the salt on them fries or something. this song is so Dinky&Corny but you find yourself doing the Shake it Off dance.the video cracks me up even more.I give Mariah her due this has been Her year as the comeback kid.
5,great stuff,Supermint is a mix of raw fun and great hooks.I haven't taken it out of my disc player yet ! It's hard to describe them......like that feeling you get when the roller coaster comes over the top and drops real fast.....you just can't wait to do it again. I just CAN'T GET ENOUGH ! They will definately be a household name soon. A must have for sure.
1,Don't wast your time,Please save your time and money and don't purchase this book. All it is a catalogue for other books that are sold by this company with a bunch of useless filler.
2,I didnt like it,"To be honest, this movie is really depressing. At the end you feel dejected and sad because of the constant ""bashing"" of the main character, Yuko.I appreciate what this movie is about, but i would have rather not seen it. The movie did not follow a conventional movie structure.I wish they actually showed Yuko in Iraq being kidnapped or serving as an aid worker. I felt like I was waiting for flashbacks throughout the entire movie but there were none. The movie is intentionally filmed in dim, dull lighting where all of the colors are sapped out. This most likely reflects Yuko's disposition and the emotions she is feeling.If you are interested in what this movie is about (volunteering, dejection from society, war kidnapping) then I suggest you see the movie. I strongly caution that this movie is depressing and extremely sad."
2,Might turn you on to Lorca.,"Poor script and weak work from the usually strong Morales pretty much tank the film, but it's beautiful to look at and Garcia jubilantly recites Lorca's poetry. The good thing about this film is that it really made me aware of Lorca, an artist whose name I had known but whose work I had never read before seeing this movie. That alone is worth a star or two. I've discovered in my reading that Lorca was not as politically involved as this film intimates. See it, do some reading, make up your own mind."
5,needed for school,i saved money compared to buying new! every penney helps for a student. school is expensive enough for this lady!
2,Older version was better!,"The 11th edition is easy to read helpful for tests and full of information.Definitely a lot cheaper! I would chose quality over quantity, and just becauseit has some pictures does not mean it is a great value!"
5,excellent product,"Companies with good names usually produce a decent product and Bahco is one of them.Easy cutting action,with a sharp blade and a longer length on the handles makes it a very competent pruner.Way better than the lower priced ones which tend to cut roughly and damage the stalks of plants and also tend to rust and gum up easily.These pruners are well suited for everyday use and I have found them to maintain their sharpness and ease of use."
3,Literary Review of Lord of the Flies,"This piece is one the literary staples of young adolescent literature. As a result, many of America's youth get the opportunity to witness how even the most civilized can be broken down and resort to savage behavior. The various themes of leadership, organization, and law and order are present as this book progresses. The author's portrayal of the events and how they develop display the very essence of man and how we thrive."
3,I didn't like it but I had a hard time putting it down.,"When I started to read Lord of the Flies, I knew it wouldn't be my type of book. But as I read, I found it hard not to continue reading. Some parts were too deep for me and I needed someone to explain them to me but the theme and moral was clear to me. I most likely never would have read the book if I hadn't needed to for school. But I am glad (if that is the right word) that I did read it; it's a classic even if it is barbareic and crude."
4,Well worth seeing,"This is not The French Connection, but Hackman is, as always, rock solid, and the supporting cast (particularly Tommy Lee Jones) is superb. The plot is improbable, with Russian and U.S. officers conspiring to continue the cold war and the case broken by a sergeant formerly married to a lieutenant colonel, who are basically operating independently against all of the forces that be. Their success (guaranteed in a quintessentially American movie) reaffirms American beliefs concerning independence and integrity while it provides some action/adventure in the process. The canvas is a little large and there are some gaffes and shaky production values, but this is a reliable way to spend a slow evening. It's also nice to see Hackman doing a credible high crawl through rough terrain in snow. He's the man."
4,Great escape read during Christmas holiday break!,"Had not read any Margolin before and, although I had suspected the twist involving the reporter before it was fully developed,it did not in any way spoil the tortuous plot. Clever use of regional USA differences, namely New York state and Pacific northwest. Psychopath well and frighteningly developed. Strong female heroine."
3,gone but not forgotten by philip margolin,"This is a book which is drama/horror/thriller, filled with suspense and lots of investigation. Its like watching a law and order type pf thing. Its a good book but it does not beat the first book I read from this author, ""sleeping beauty"" which I thought was a really great book and very well written."
5,BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME,"I love this book. it was the first, but not last book, I have read by Philip Margolin. The characters are brought to life right in front of you. The scenes are real and heart pounding. If you don't or do like to read, please, read this book. I have never, in my entire life, read such a good book. Keep up the good work, Mr. Margolin!"
4,Hard to Forget,This book is difficult to put down and holds your attention in every chapter. A great read for the summer or anytime. Mystery and suspense at its best.
2,I don't like reality shows.,"To be honest, for a so-called ""reality show"" I guess it passes technical marks, but I simply don't like the genre, and I'm not really attracted to New York women. Superficial of me? Well, it is a TV program, and image is what's being sold. I like California girls; country, surfer, suburb (""Valley"") and all that goes with them. I simply don't connect with the housewife genre, nor the east coast in general.But, if you're into looking at the private lives of the privaledge married types, then have a look. You might like it. I didn't. Or rather, I did, but in a rubber-necker road-wreck kind of way."
4,Amusing fun story,"This Vonnegut novel is about a futuristic world that is controlled by machines and engineers. The main character of the book, Paul Proteus, is an engineer himself, and in the course of the novel he starts to question his job and the society his peers have created. It is a very funny and entertaining critique of modernization and the ever increasing role of machines in our lives. The only problem i had with the book was the ending, which seemed rushed and too short. It seemed as if Vonnegut was not sure where to take the story anymore and therefore decided to end it quickly. Other than that, the book is excellent; it is definitly worth reading."
5,A stellar debut for Vonnegut,"The great Kurt Vonnegut's first novel is, well, great.This was nothing short of excellent; a strong cast of characters and a vividly imagined world, yes, but where Player Piano really shines is in its rich social commentary. In this world, America has established a sort of minor utopia of ease within which regular, everyday people don't have to do much of anything. Everything is done for them.And boy does that make people miserable.At times funny, at times heavy with satire, and at times straight and serious, Vonnegut manages to keep all the plates spinning at once. Dr. Paul Proteus is a near perfect protagonist, even though he doesn't DO much of anything really. He's just along for the ride, observing the modern world in which he lives and realizing that a life of ease and convenience has a down side. And what an ending!Player Piano makes it clear that Vonnegut was mining gold from the very start."
4,Interesting enough,"I enjoy all of Vonnegut's book. I'd recommend this book to anyone who appreciates his writing style and humor. Don't expect a mind bending adventure or sci-fi thriller, it's thought provoking and worth a read."
2,"if you do not like this book, don't stop reading Vonnegut","This book did not appeal to me. I have read many Vonnegut books and this one was just boring. Unlike other Vonnegut Books, this did not hook me. It was not interesting or weird, thus boring me to death. To tell you the truth, I skipped many pages just to get done with this book.Like I said, if you hated this book or are about to read it, do not judge Vonnegut by just reading this book. I would rather suggest reading Cat's Cradle, Galapagos, or Breakfast of Champions. This book does not include any of vonegut's black humor, or sheer bizzarity (I have no clue if that is a word) well anyway, The back cover may seem interesting, but the book rarely touches this subject."
3,Kindle version Overpriced and Packed with Typos,"So, the incremental cost of an Kindle e-book is zero, but it is priced higher than the paperback version. RIP OFF! Not only that, but the Kindle version is chock full of typos. It looks like they shoved the book through a scanner with OCR (optical character recognition) and never bothered to clean up the scanning errors. Anyone who reads the book cannot miss all the typos, some of which are in critical passages. Ridiculous. If I'm going to be overcharged for an e-book, for god's sake fix the scanning errors.Complaints about the Kindle version aside, this is a great book to read...- 5 stars for the writing- 1 star for Amazon's pricing and pathetic typos in the Kindle version- Resulting overall score: 3 stars"
3,Player Piano,"The book was pretty good. I can see how Vonnegut was just forming his style in the book, just becoming comic, ""sci-fi"" and all. As far as the ""great condition""/like new, I have had books in better condition from this category. But it was still very cheap and readable, so that is all I needed!"
2,Stick-ability Definately STINKS!,"I started using these 3 weeks ago - on three small keloid scars. Not sure if they're working or not, but I've lost half the box on having them roll off. I agree - you can end up spending a LOT on medical tape and make things look much worse then they are. Today I tried a little superglue along the edges and will see. I wrote to Pfizer...will see and will return with more results. Pfizer replied promptly with full refund - sure have to admire that!"
1,Waist of Money,"This product is a total waist of money. The adhesive doesn't work, they won't stay on for five minutes. I have used every scar product on the market and this is by far the worst."
4,My life is better because of this thing...,"This unit is very good. I have used several in-car units from Lexus, and this appears to work much better and correctly.So far, only one address has not been found, and it has flawlessly gotten me around orlando, florida without getting lost.For the navigationally impaired -- this is a gift from the big guy upstairs."
2,Broken Car Adapter after 11 months,"The Garmin 2620 works well, but car adapter is broken after 11 months. Car adapters for 2610, 2620, 2720, etc have the same problems"
3,take a hardcopy map too!,"Since writing an earlier review of this unit I had to drive up to Naples, Maine. This town is on the AAA map. This town is known to Microsoft Streets and Trips. This town is not in the Garmin's database. Just up the lake is Harrison, Maine. Again, it is known to AAA and Microsoft but unknown to Garmin. Just west of Naples is a larger town called Bridgton. This is in the Garmin database but at the wrong location. The 2620 tries to navigate you to some guy's private house about 2 miles around a lake from the actual town.I spent a fair amount of time with the Magellan hard-drive GPS units and never noticed these kinds of holes and errors in the database."
5,Great Book!,"This book is an awesome bibliography. This author is coming to my school and I'm really excited. Before I read this book I didn't know what bad things polio could do in fact I had no clue what polio was. By reading this book I found out in a fun way what polio was. I would much rather read this book then sit down and read an encyclpodia. If you haven't read this book, READ IT! It's an terrific book about Peg and her friends."
5,This is a Great Book!,I loved this book! It is about a girl named Peg who is stricken with Polio. My fav. part was when her temperature dropped by drinking the chocolate milkshake. I would recommend this book for anyone!
2,Strange,"When I was younger I read alot of Stephen King's work. However, as I've grown older I have real trouble reading his books. I always find them rambling.After reading the reviews for this book and being told by friends it's a good read I decided to try it. I never really knew what was going on in the book at all. I'm still so hopelessly confused and even though it does read a bit fast, I wasn't happy with the book. It just didn't grab me and make me want to read anything further in this series.If you are a King fan, I'd recommend this book if you haven't read it yet. If you aren't a King fan, I'd suggest not reading it."
5,Enter a world like no other...,"I don't like Stephen King's novels. I find them dull, wordy and they are some of the only books I can't finish. Then I came across The Gunslinger. It is a book of magic, of another world, of pure and unadulteraded genius. This is the series Stephen King was born to write. From the first sentence you are drawn into the world of the Gunslinger. And you don't escape until you reach the end of the book. I couldn't put this book down and when I finished I read it all over again. I'm not going to go into a long description of the book, I wouldn't do it justice. You have to read this one for yourself. Enter the world of imagination, and from what I gather if you are a King fan, you may recognise some of the characters. The only critisism I have is when is the author going to give us the next book in the series?? I can't wait."
1,as exciting and interesting as toast,"On the previous review page, I saw that many people enjoyed this book. All that I can think is that perhaps I missed something. I found this to be one of the most disappointing books that I have read in quite some time. The characters were uninteresting, the plot read like a re-hashed version of a bad futuristic sci-fi movie, and I never found myself caring for anything that King wrote about. The best way to summarise the plot would be to say that a man walks through a desert for 300 pages {`it's hot, I'm thirsty, it's hot, I'm alone, etc. etc.} and then meets a man, falls asleep {which is what I kept doing throughout this book} and then . . . sequel? Eugh. Maybe this is all necessary for the rest of the series, but it's put me off them."
4,Interesting World,"This first book in The Dark Tower series starts out at a slow pace, but as always Stephen King's descriptions quickly birth a new world in my mind. ""The Gunslinger"" also known as Roland is on a quest, the story begins with him chasing after ""The Man in Black"" also known as Walter o 'Dim. This first in a series leads you and gives you a dim idea of what is to come, but doesn't reveal to much...still it does make me want to read the next book, to find out what this world is about. It leaves me with questions such as What is this world? Is it another version of earth? Is it afterlife? All good questions that I look forward to finding answers to in the next few books. Overall I can't give it a five start simply because I found it slightly confusing, but still a great book."
2,Not for me,"This book is obviously well written, but I could not get into it. It did not create a interesting world for me like Tolkien does. Other reviews had prepared me for the slow pace of this first book and I did finish it, but in the end the gunslinger was not a character I found endearing like Frodo or magical like Gandalf. It is quite possible that I am getting too old for fantasy, who knows. I did buy book 2 of the series but put it aside after 20 pages. Not for me."
5,"""The Gunslinger"" makes you want to read more.","Eerie, imaginative, and vivid all describe ""The Gunslinger and the Dark Tower"". This book is the first part of the ""Dark Tower"" series of books by Stephen King.This book is about the gunslinger, whose real name is Roland, and his quest across a desolate land. This land is a twisted mirror or our own. He walks through the desert in the pursuit of answers to many questions he has. These answers are held by the man in black. In his pursuit he has a romance with a woman named Alice, who lives in Tull, a town in the middle of the desert. He also adopts Jake, a boy from Earth, as his son.This book makes you want to read it until the end. Even in the end it leaves many questions unanswered. I actually want to read the next book in the series, which is the first time a book has made me want to read another book. This is why I believe this book is great, because it leaves you wanting more."
5,Number one with a Bullet!,"First time I bought this book I was amazed, because this didn't look like ordinary King-stuff. I was astounded by the great illustrations, too. I had a few occations of trying to get into the whole story, but the more I tried, the more I liked it. It was different King, and then again it wasn't, and I liked it a lot. It's strange, mystic, gothic and scary at many times. The world of the Gunslinger and his hunt for the Man in Black really enchanted me, and I couldn't put the book down. As I realized that this was the first book in a serie, I couldn't wait to get my hands in the others. But this Dark Tower 1 was my number one with a bullet, especially in a time where I only thought that King wrote downright horror."
3,Hard to read,"I bought it, so I read it. I Didn't really like it. this is not my kind of story at all."
5,Fascinating blend of genres.,"This blend of sci-fi meets western might not be what is expected from everybody's favorite boogieman, but the way the story unravels page by page will keep you enthralled. As Roland journeys from his home after the world moves on, he sees things he never dreamt of, but discovers that the lessons of his childhood serve him well in any situation. The quest for the Dark Tower, the nexus of worlds becomes his obsession. Long time Stephen King readers will find nuances and innuendos from previous stories interwoven into the story line. Fantastic read."
4,Great start to a even better series,"I thought this book was great. From the moment I started it I could not put it down. It is my least favorite out of the series, but it is still an excellent book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes western fiction or fantasy. Roland is like a lone cowboy, but the world around him is full of fantasy. It only gets better when we are introduced to new characters in the next books."
3,The Gunslinger,I'm finding it difficult to decide exactly how I feel about this book. At parts I loved it and at others I was bored by it. I think I will need a reread at some stage to more fully comprehend everything. It was enjoyable though and I look forward to the rest of the series.
5,Amazing,This book left off at a cliff hanger leaving the reader to thirst for more. I would recommend this book for people seeking a good thriller.
2,"Dark Tower Series Great, but Skip to Book Two!","The Dark Tower series is outstanding. But episode one is often slow, slow. Achingly slow travel across endless landscape. Much of it was apparently written by King early in his career. Skip to The Drawing of the Three, with its recap at the beginning. Then enjoy, as episode two is great, with its clever travel from Roland's post-apocalyptic world to our world of the 60s then 80's then 90's. Book Two becomes much more sci-fi fantasy. You'll miss little by going into the more current Drawing of Three, a much better book."
2,"This edition contains many typos, and the odd grammar error","This printing of the book is definitely not up to King's usual standard, though much of the blame may be placed on the publisher. There's numerous typos (at least in this edition of the book), with letters like h substituted for n (she raised her nands to her face, for example), and there is the odd grammar mistake. It also appears disjointed, with things happening without any explaination, or only a partial explaination. For example, a demon that possesses a woman is killed (we know this because the gunslinger says it is dead) but no explaination is given for how it was done, etc."
3,A slow start,"Book 1 in Stephen King's 7-part epic, The Dark Tower series gets off to a slow start with poor pacing and muddy storytelling in setting up his mammoth (from what I hear) storyline. The series does get better and becomes more interesting from book 2 and on from what I've been told so I'll give the next book a try to see what all the hoopla is about."
4,It's not as boring as most of his books are.,"+AH4-After reading this book, you'll DEFINITELY want to read the continuences. This was a good book--very amuseing and Stephen King has good writing techniques. I hope you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.+AH4-"
4,Interesting,"The Gunslinger was a very interesting and intriguing book. I like books with new concepts, not the same old love story or action book. The Gunslinger tale is very unique. My head was constantly swirling attempting to grasp where exactly Roland was. King does an amazing job describing the landscape, action scenes, and thoughts of Roland the Gunslinger. I look forward to reading the rest of this series."
2,Gunslinger shoots own foot,"The mish-mash of Western, Sci-fi, and Fantasy is very contrived, and leaves a bad taste in the reader's mouth. The plot was very linear, and the ending just falls away. I will not be reading the next 7 in this series."
3,Higher expectations,"When I read the short story called ""Little Sisters of Eluria"" by Stephen King, I liked it so much that I was really looking forward to getting my hands on the first book of The Gunslinger series. But, throughout the entire book, I did not experience any of the level of involvement that I did with the short story. I didn't want to stop reading ""Little Sisters..."" I have heard that this series gets better as you go along, but I am not one to purchase and read the second book when the first one did not grab me. If I am not pulled in in the first couple of chapters, I usually put a book down. But, because of the short story - and because this was Stephen King, who I respect tremendously, I read on and finished the book. But, I have to say that I was disappointed because I really had much higher expectations."
1,UGH,"Every October I try to read on horror book to get me in the mood for Halloween. I have previously choosen a number of Steven King titles, all of which did a great job getting me ready for the spookiest time of year. This year I decided on this book, and must admit that I am terribly disappointed in it. It never seemed to go anywhere, and ended without actually ending. I have since read that Steven King wrote this over many years, and did not have a plan for the story when he started. To me, it felt just like that, incomplete, unplanned, and just a rambling idea. I will not be reading any more of this series."
3,1,"Ich möchte ganz neue deutsche Disco Fox Songs: Suche ausserdem die Songs: Weil ich dich liebe, Die Manage ist leer, Nicht ein Wort davon ist wahr,Gib mein Herz zurück, Du und die das geht nie,Mitten in der Nacht: Kenne leider die Interpreten nicht, bekam von einem freund aus Germany ein Tape und mir gefallen besonders diese Lieder. Please search nach Interpret und CD."
3,Not as fresh an approach as I had expected,"I have other books by Ted Andrews which I like. However, this one felt heavy and not quite on the mark."
5,Sexy Shoes,"These have to be the sexiest shoes I have ever seen. You should get them now. As an avid soccer player I've been looking for a good pair of shoes which have the right mix of style and support, and I would say that these would have to be them. They may cost alot but believe me, they're worth it."
2,Maybe order a bigger bottle...,"Just got the 1 oz. bottle today. It was mailed in an envelope. I guess that was more economical than a box for such a small bottle, but somewhere along the way it got smushed so that half the bottle's contents were a tacky coating on the inside of the envelope by the time I got it. So if you order, maybe get a larger bottle than I did, and if it comes in an envelope, don't open it near any carpeting or furniture, just to be on the safe side."
2,It has it's moments...,"...but overall, a weak effort. This album resembles Despise the Sun, but even more ""streamlined"" (record company jargon for watered-down). Some of the riffs are annoyingly cliche. And they repeat the same riffs too many times within each song. Unfortunately, this is still better than most of what's out there."
2,Not at all interesting,"I bought this CD because I heard a sampler from Relapse,or whatever their record company is. I thought they'd be cool.But this is the most generic death metal there is. There wereno riffs that I could get into. The drums were annoying as hell.I think the Florida scene is the least interesting except for bands like Six Feet Under. They are perhaps a few out there that are good.Don't get me wrong. I love bands like Summon, Drawn and Quartered, Abominator, Bestial Mockery, Deicide etc. But thisplatter of Suffocation didn't really do it for me. I am interesting in checking out their earlier material though."
5,Great Stuffing Mix,"Not only is this FAST & EASY, it tastes great! Add a cup of chicken, carrots chopped onion & celery and you have a great casserole."
2,non-smooth griddle surface,"I assumed, ( incorrectly as it turned out) that the griddle surface would be like other griddle surfaces of my cast iron cookware. That is to say- *smooth*. The surface is rough cast-iron - exactly the way it came out of the mold. THe same is true of my recently purchased Lodge cast iron frying pan. My (much ) older cast iron lodge frying pan and early griddle had machined cooking surfaces. No longer. No amount of ""seasoning"" will enable one to fry items or deglaze without some sticking because of the rough surface regardless of the amount of oil one uses on the surface ( unless of course you're frying in an inch of oil.) A disappointment."
4,Its not flat,"Its a beautiful piece too bad its not flat bottomed, so it wont sit on a glass cooktopwithout rocking"
1,Worst 30 bucks I ever spent!,"I bought this to replace some worn out Club griddles,Thinking this would be great as I have a couple very old cast iron skillets.Used it the first time only to find the surface finish is so rough, the texture of sand, that every thing sticks so bad unless it is floating in grease, not sure why they don't try to make the cooking surface smooth so it does not stick so bad, but if you still cook with a ton of lard, then they probably work great for you. Other wise a 12"" piece of steel plate would work better..I am thinking of taking out to the shop and sand the sufurce and re-season it.Buy different one!"
3,"Lodge Pro Logic 12"" Griddle","I wanted something to cook pancakes in where I could cook a number at a time. It is a great griddle, the only problem I have is that I wish it were a 10"" because I have an electric stove and the burner is not large enough to heat the edges of the skillet. Would be great to use in camping."
4,Works great! You just need to heat it up!,"I've read a lot of the other reviews stating that this doesn't heat evenly, but I haven't had any issues. If you let it heat up ok and give it a thin coat of oil, food doesn't stick and it works just fine. And without all the chemical issues of nonstick cookware."
3,Uneven heating help,"I own several cast iron skillets and love them. This griddle doesn't have the even heating of the 12 inch skillet. Lodge suggests pre heating it in the oven first, that solves the problem. An extra step, but for cooking lots of bacon at once this griddle can't be beat."
3,I am not sure this has any impact.,"I washed and clayed my car for the first time. It was not clear to me that the claying of the car made a huge difference before I waxed it. To be fair, the car was only 6 months old and I have kept it very clean in that short time, so perhaps the car did not need to be clayed. That said, the claying process was not difficult, and this spray definitely allowed the clay to glide smoothly on the car's surface."
4,Good Advice Regardless of Your Politics,"Luntz is a pro. His message has the ring of absolute truth. If you face a career in the corporate or political world, you stand to benefit greatly from his insights and advice."
3,expecting better,"The one word that came to mind as I tried to cull some knowledge from this work is 'puffery'. That is a word that works for this book. As a fellow market researcher I was hoping to gain some insight from a high visibility professional but as other reviewers have pointed out there is so much name dropping, political partisanship, and blathering that I could not finish the book. It is in need of a good editor, but apparently Luntz used the right words to talk them out of it. I was disappointed to have wasted my time."
1,Books That Waste Time,"Having heard Luntz interviewed on Talk Radio several times, I thought this might be just the book to give me insight into the word smithing that goes on behind the scenes in politics.Unfortunately, Luntz' writing style is bland, droll, and boring. So much so, that the reader's mind wanders almost immediately.Perhaps there was an unimaginable recovery after the first forty or so pages, but I find it highly unlikely.In summation, when I finish a book I deliberately leave it where someone else can find and hopefully enjoy it. With Luntz' book, I threw it in the garbage."
5,"So Good, It's scary",Dr. Luntz does an excellent job explaining both in theory and application the power of language. This is a must read for anyone in communications.
1,A 'WORD' to the wise,"I recommend people read this book (borrow it, don't spend money on it) for self defense; to better understand what they're up against in the world of politics, power and media. This book reinforces the fact that too many people in positions of authority use language to manipulate the uninformed, the gullible and sometimes even the worldly-wise. Call me naive, call me an idealist, but language should be used to convey truth....not to fool people into thinking something is other than it is. The honest and appropriate language for this book is 'despicable'."
4,Great Book,"Frank Luntz does a great job of driving across that it's not what you say, it's what people hear. Although the book had a lot of political references, the lessons to effective language can be applied to any walk of life."
4,"Good reading, but disappointing ending","I found this book enjoyable and readable. I had a hard time putting it down and kept wanting to read more. However, the ending was very abrupt, and really did not give the reader much satisfaction. It didn't really fit with the rest of the character of the book. Nevertheless, I felt the imagery was excellent and the storyline was interesting."
4,it is good,it is kind the old west the guy returns home to find outlaws to taken it over and he works to clean it up the town
3,Long term investment,"The tub looks nice and is as expected. American Standard describes the material only as ""Americast"" so there is no idea what the components of this tub are. The floor of the tub is rendered non-slip by patches of roughened material which may or may not stain by trapping soap scum. Only time will tell. It is otherwise a neat, compact design."
4,Better to buy in person,"The Snappy Sounds books are great, but I got one from Amazon and the one page did not play music. I ordered them because a few were half price. But it is probably best to buy these at a store so you can make sure each page plays music."
1,No... No... No....,"Yeah, you want a second opinion?... it's bad, really really bad. The Strokes are probably one of my favorite bands, so when I saw this, I was really excited... That Didn't last long. I put it in my car, and said, ""What the crap is this?"" There are probably two or three songs on here that I could handle (The version of ""The End Has No End"" is pretty cool) but other than that... no. Some of the songs sound NOTHING at all like The Strokes songs (New York City Cops). Please don't buy this.. save yourself the disapointment."
1,Not Useful,I didn't find these series of books very useful at all. I bought them when I first started out in the HVAC industry and they were no help to me. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Thanks!!!
2,A very good product,"After reading a few reviews I wasn't so sure about this headset. I guessed correctly that the people who had poor radio reception may live in areas that have a high level of airwave interference. My headset has great reception for both am and fm. I haven't figured out yet how to use my ipod with it. I think I need to buy an adapter, similar to a car adapter.Now I can cruise around with my lawnmower and listen to the radio , very nice.....it keeps my ears warm too..UPDATE..after coming back I see I made a mistake with my star rating...it should be 5 stars"
3,easy going and likeable but not tops,"i'd read great things about this but it was, frankly , a bit of a disappointment. The Band is spot on and Charles' laid back vibe is perfect. but having heard secrets of the heart and loving it, i was disappointed in the song quality. granted it almost 30 years earlier than secrets but it was just ok. last train to memphis which i also ordered is much much better and equal in spirit and fun to secrets. that said i love bobby charles. ames arnold, richmond , va."
4,Fun family movie from another era,"Great family movie, from the time when Hollywood stillregularly included examples of good moral values in itsofferings aimed at youth. I concur with Dudley Tate'sreview in that aspect. This piece is very easy to watch,and the extended battle between the horse and the blackbear is the only violence in it.As to the quality of the print, however, I must disagree.This film was obviously not shot on Kodachrome. Theprint used to make the DVD has faded heavily towardred and green tones, and no amount of adjusting of color,tint, contrast, or brightness on my set could restorea full color spectrum. But that is minor.For its intended audience, it succeeds wonderfully."
4,Know the rules before you break them,"In this book Frensham assumes that every novice writer is out to make millions from Hollywood. Hollywood scripts have become a formula. A formula that is often very effective but none the less a formula. However this is a great book for new writers who need to learn the rules before they start breaking them.Most importantly Frensham takes us through a step by step writing process from the generation of ideas through to editing the script. This is an important skill for new writers who are reluctant to do any prewriting.Buy ""Teach Yourself Screenwriting"" and learn about character motivation, the 3 act structure, sequences and the 8 basic stories. Wheather or not you agree with Frenshams ideas this book will definetly get you thinking."
5,One of the best out there!,"Awesome, awesome book! I've purchased six books on screenwriting and so far this is the best one I've found!"
2,Takes the fun out of screenwriting,I found this book to be cluttered up with rules and what not. It was more like filling out an application form and checking if you're making the requirements rather than a movie with themes and emotions.I found it disheartening and it nearly made me give up screenwriting One to avoid I urge you.
4,Remarkably thorough history of a troubled province,"Marianne Elliot compiles an unique and thorough history of Catholocism in Ireland's most troubled province of Ulster. The information contained in this book is invaluable for anyone attempting to trace the roots of the current troubles in Northern Ireland, or with any serious interest in the history of this troubled island. This book is not for the casual reader, as Elliot's dry academic style could grow wearisome for those looking for a light, enjoyable read."
4,nice,"My wife and I like this player a lot. The picture is clear, controls are easy to work, and the sound is nice. We only play DVDs. The only flaw is that it doesn't play foreign disks. I've searched the web for a work-around. There seems not to be one."
2,audio problems,I purchased this unit from Best Buy and it has a bad hum on the Red channel out. The replacement was no better. I've found two other articles on the web from guys with the same issue? Today I'm trying a different brand.
3,works fine!,"to the whiners with the noise problems, maybe you should read the directions first. i hooked it up properly and had no problems with the sound. it's a pretty decent sony product. i would have to concur that the loading time is pretty slow and sometimes irritating."
5,Anthology is worth it,"As a Bryan Adams fan I expected this Cd to be awesome and it doesn't dissapoint! I am surpised that ""Do I have to say the words?"", ""I Finally found someone"", and ""Kids wanna Rock"" wasn't included but nonethless my favorite songs were on here.Top Favorite songs1.Run to you2.Somebody3.Summer of 69'4.The heat of the night5.Can't stop this thing we started6.All for Love7.Have you ever really loved a woman8.Here I am"
4,GOOD OVERWIEW OF BRYAN.,"WHEN I GET HOME WITH THIS CD I THOUGHT THAT I JUST HAVE BOUGHT ALL MY FAVOURITE SONGS OF BRYAN ADAMS IN A DOUBLE CD, BUT THEN I REALIZE THAT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ""DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS?"", I'M A LITTLE DISAPOINTED,THE SONGS ARE DIGITALLY REMASTERED AND YOU CAN HEAR PERFECTLY CLEAR EVERY INSTRUMENT AND THAT'S GREAT. THIS IS A GOOD COMPILATION BUT NOT COMPLETE. ""KIDS WANNA ROCK"" IS NOT HERE TOO."
4,Bryans Songs,"Take a songwriter, vocalist and add slashing guitars, fantastic keyboards, pounding drums and you've got Bryan Adams' music. This album takes us back to the beginning prior to 1980 if you include when he starting writing. This includes 36 tunes on 2 discs plus a bonus DVD. If you're a Bryan fan, you know all of these so just a word about some of the recordings - this has the long, not radio, version of ""Everything I Do', a studio version of 'The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You', (I prefer the Unplugged version), live version of '18 Til I Die'. Missing on this album is his duet with 'Barbra Streisand'. For the most part though, this IS the Bryan Adams story and a bargain to boot."
5,can't stop this thing he started,"All of his greatest songs in a cd package well worth the price. Plus great bonus songs from concerts and great duets, one that really will surprise you. Great ballads, and great dance music, you like Bryan Adams, you will love this cd. Everything you need in a cd, he does it for you."
3,cute but baby-ish?,"This product goes up to 5 feet, so your child is going to be something like maybe 10 or 11 by the time you stop using it. How is he/she going to feel with the plush teddy bear thing on their big-kid bedroom wall? Seems like a lot of kids might find it an ""unappealing part of their decor"" by the time they are 6 or 7 ;)"
1,Leak all the time,I'm so frustrated with these bottles - they leak all the time no matter what I do with them. I've heard the same complaint from many other new Moms. I would never recommend these and will never use them again.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I registered for and purchased Avent products thinking they were the best in the market. I wish I could get the money back for these expensive products. The Avent bottles leak like crazy. It doesn't matter if you use the stage 1 or stage 4 feeding nipples, they leak the same. This is not a once in a while occurance either- it happens on a regular basis. I was glad to see from other reviews that I was not the only one to have this problem with Avent products.If the bottle top is not screwed on exactly right, or if one little drop of water, milk, or grain of formula powder gets in the way, the bottles leak and you and your baby will end up drenched in formula or juice. Nothing is worse than getting up for a 3:00 a.m. feeding only to find the two of you soaked from a leaky bottle. Don't waste your money on these products. I wish I hadn't."
1,Hate them,"These bottles are horrible! I agree with one of the other reviewers that they leak, but unlike her experience that they leak inconsistently, mine leak all of the time. I have wasted so much formula and time with these bottles. Sometimes they have leaked all over my daughter before I realize it. I am going to do my best to return them even thugh they have been used. I hate to see the manufacturer get rich off of something that doesn't work."
1,avoid at all cost,"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating."
1,"leak, leak , leak","These bottles are not worth it. No matter how tight you screw the nipple on, they leak like crazy. I thought i was doing something wrong at first but then bought new ones and had same problem. I'm not talking a little leak either. The milk just starts to pour out from the lid. don't waste your money on these!"
3,Okay boattles,"This is an okay bottle when they don't leak. I know that you have to follow the directions to the letter, however that doesn't always work to prevent leaks from occuring. When they don'[t leak they are fantastic, when you get a leak they are horrible. You end up with half the bottle all over your hands and on the baby. I continue to use them because the are the only bottles my son likes and I have tried them all. So keep in mind that even though you follow the directions you may still run into leaks."
2,Save your money,"A friend recommended Avent, so I thought they would be good. WRONG. I loved that they have a wide opening. That's great, except they leaked all the time. What a MESS!"
2,They leak all over the place!!,I used Avent with my first child iin 2006 and I was very happy and had no problem. BUT the new BPA free bottles that I am using now with my second child leak all over the place. It's very frustrating. DO NOT buy them until Avent fix the problem.
2,leaky and frustrating,unless you get the cap on just right these are leaky - i am not interested in playing with the cap a few times to get a correct seal when there are so many other bottles that never leak - I had 6 of them and thru them in the trash after countless leaks on my son's chest.
1,"Leak-prone, messy bottles",These bottles are terrible. They will leak. They will drip. They will drive you crazy.
2,"No leaks, but......","I used Playtex disposables for my first child, and I thought I would rather use reusable bottles for my next child. I bought these bottles because they were supposed to be the best on the market. Well, it turns out that my son is allergic to milk which causes him to be very gassy (even on hypoallergenic formula), and these bottles only seemed to make his gas and colic worse. They never leaked like so many others have complained about, but they sure did nothing to help with his gas and colic like they claim to do. He also spit up constantly while on these bottles. I'm angry to have spent so much money on a bottle system that I will now be donating to a second hand store, and I have to go in search of new bottles that will help with his gas."
2,This Bottle Leaks!,"Just this morning I had to change MY CLOTHES due to this leaky bottle. It's a shame because they are ""ergonomically flawless"", yet the 9 oz version of this ruins nap time and feeding time because baby and parent get soaked!I would love to endorse this product, but after putting up with the leaks from multiple Avent 9 oz bottles, I have to say BUYER BEWARE."
1,Too many leaks!,"I spent so much money on all of these Avent bottles because I THOUGHT they were supposed to be the best. Well, I'm throwing them all in the trash now because I have had it with all of the leaks. I am so tired of formula being spilled all over my baby & me! Also, the slow flow newborn nipples flow too fast for my baby and she chokes, coughs, and spits up. I just purchased the Playtex VentAire bottles, and she is much happier & drier!! I haven't had a leak or mess since the switch. Save your money & don't buy them!!"
1,Very leaky and quite expensive...not recommended,"I was told that these were the best bottles on the market, and the nipples are a nice silicone that my son liked, but the leaking got to be unbearable after a while. How awful to pump an entire bottle of breatmilk and lose half of it on the baby's shirt and on your hands! At the daycare center, all the caregivers agreed that Avent bottles weren't worth it, and they should know, given that they deal with dozens of different types of bottles. There are lots of other bottles on the market that don't leak at all -- I just switched to the Playtex nurser and my son has no problem with it."
1,To say it in the nicest way--I strongly disliked these bottles,These bottles are so annoying. You have to screw the nipple on just right otherwise the liquid just spills out! I have had these bottles for almost a year and still have not figured out why they leak sometimes and not the others. I will never buy these bottles again. They are expensive and totally a waste of good money that could go toward better things (we all know there are plenty of other things money can be spent on when it comes to children!).
1,These leak,"All over the place. Yuck. All over baby, all over everything. I am switching to something else. These have to be a joke."
2,Leaky bottle,"We used these bottles for our daughter over 3 years ago and they seemed to work fine. So, we purchased them again for our son, who is now 7 months, and they leak just about every time we very tightly seal the bottle. I would not recommend these bottles!!"
1,Bloody leaky bottles,"You turn the cap less or you make it tight,No matter how you try, you wont get it right.You think they drank four, but they only got three,Because below their mouths, the bottle's on a leaking spree.The thing is going to leak, screw it as you might.Who needs this aggravation, at 3 in the night.Warm milk or cold milk, no matter what it holds,Its gonna leak out and seep into their neck folds.You'll need a calibrated wrench, from the Institute of Measures,Who needs these leaky hassles, to feed their little treasures.Each time I use them now, I end up swearing,Many have leaked similar complaints, how can Avent be so uncaring?"
2,They do not Leak...they Pour!,"Here is our experience: The nice thing about Avent is they are very easy to clean, but the mess they make isn't. This is our first time using Avent bottles. I did not use Avent with our first two children and I never experienced the leaking with their bottles as I am with the Avent bottles. The leaking doesn't happen right away. It begins about two weeks after you have been using the product. It doesn't just leak, it pours out! Of course, I thought we were just over tightening or not pulling the nipple all the way through the ring, but that was not the problem. Please note that Avent has an extensive page on their web-site regarding trouble-shooting for leaky bottles. That speaks for itself. One should not have to manipulate or figure out how to screw a nipple onto a bottle, no matter if it's 3:00 in the morning, out shopping or at home in the middle of the afternoon."
1,Leaks!!!!!,"I hate these bottles, I have a ton of them that I have registered for with my first baby who is 16 months old. I heard they were the best from the store, but when you have a screaming baby who wants to be fed then you have to take the bottle away cause it is leaking all over them and you lose half of your breast milk, it really makes us both mad!!!!"
2,They leak,"I got these bottles as a gift and since bottles are expensive, I used them. I had no problems in general, my baby used them fine from the time she was 5 weeks old. I'm just weaning her now at 13 mos. The major complaint I have about these is that they leak around the rim like crazy. Sometimes you have to unsrew it and put it back on two or three times before you can keep them from running all over. And, no, it's not just one. All of them did it."
2,Too Leaky!,I purchased the Avent bottles because I heard they were the best. They were very expensive but I bought them anyway. I am very disappointed with these bottles. They leak alot!! Not just a tiny drip here and there but streams of formula running down the bottle onto my son and his clothes. He is often soaked after feedings and I have to completely change his outfit. I tried not tightening the bottles so much and I must admit that it helped. But I still get about 1 leaking bottle a day. Just enough to soil me or my son's clothes. The only good thing is that they are super easy to clean. I am to cheap to go out and buy a bunch of bottles that are a different brand. Who knows if those will work either. But I would not recommend that anyone buy these bottles. More expensive does not mean better!
1,Terrible! Waste of Money!,"Avent is not a good product. The bottles do not prevent baby from getting too much air in their tummies. One thing I really hated about these bottles is that they leaked! When I would go to shake up the bottle, I would get formula everywhere. So, I would unscrew the nipple and tighten it again. Same thing. I'm sorry, but I expect bottles not to leak when I pay almost 5 dollars a bottle. This product is a gimmick!"
3,Good but not 'great',"These bottles were okay but the sound of the air entering the bottle during feeding was both annoying and disturbing. My son had really bad gas with these and spit up a whole bunch. I started out using the gerber bottles and switched to these because he had worse gas and spit up with those. These helped but not all that well. I now use the Dr.Brown's wide neck bottles and my son very rarely spits up at all. He never fights his bottle and they are not loud and bothersome like the avent ones. If your child has only mild gas these are great, but for the worst case gas and spit up there are better options."
1,Leaks - very disappointed - No stars,"My (thankfully free) Avent bottles leaked and it was very frustrating. Today I bought my daughter the toddler Avent cups - AND THEY LEAK, TOO! Unreal."
2,Don't work for everyone,"I received a really nice gift pack of Avent bottles at one of my baby showers. The quality of the bottles is great, but they don't work for everyone. The leaked horribly. When I say leak, the milk didn't come pouring out of the rim or anything, but the nipples are an odd shape that can be difficult for some infants to master, causing the milk to run all over their face and clothes. My husband got so frustrated with the amount of milk running down our 2 month old's face that the threw most of the in the trash. I gave the remaining bottles to a friend who is having the same problems with her 3 month old. I wouldn't waste the money on these - the Evenflo Ultra's are better"
5,TOO TIGHT NIPPLES=LEAKING,"My son is 6months old, we've been using these bottles since he was 2weeks old(the breastfeeding thing did not work out). I had big problems with the bottles leaking. I went back to work and asked another mother about this problem. She called Advent and the problem was that she was screwing the nipples on too tight, it breaks the seal. Ever since that conversation I haven't had any problems with leaking."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I purchased these bottles for my baby and she had nothing but problems. Constantly had major tummy aches and severe gas, I was to the point of trying everything even changing formula, that didn't work. My husband reminded me of a mom in babies r us who said she had the bottles and her baby had a lot of gas and once she changed her bottles he was fine. Well we changed to the dependable Playtex Nurser and my baby if perfectly happy.She never has a tummy ache and gas is very rare. It look me 3months to figure this out and now I feel horrible that my baby suffered, don't let your baby. I have heard of this many times and I wish I had listened. If I could have given less than 1 star I would have!"
4,A good bottle but no better than most,"We have used these, plus Gerber and supermarket generic brands of bottles, and frankly there is not much difference. A silicone teat doesn't seem much better than a latex teat, although of course the latex will deteriorate after a year or so (by which time you will probably not need it anyway).The best thing about Avent feeding products is their compatibility with their steam steriliser, with every piece fitting in perfectly.These bottles so sometimes leak, but I am told this is more to do with how your baby feeds than the design of the bottle. So by all means, but a set of these and a set of cheapies, and see which works best for you."
3,They LEAK!,"Although these bottles are easy to clean and nice because all the parts are interchangeable...they LEAK! Especially the 9 oz. size. You can tighten and retighten the lids but some will leak when you shake them, and others will leak while feeding. Today my five week old ended up wearing half of his bottle because it was leaking out from under the ring. For the price I don't think they are worth the hassle! I'm going to buy all new bottles tomorrow."
3,Like the System but it Leaks,"I used a couple of varieties of bottles before purchasing this one. My primary reasons for selecting Avent were the size and structure of the bottle, the fact that it seemed a little ""sturdier,"" and the added advantage of being able to use a sippy top when my son is older. My only complaint is that the bottles leak big time. What an annoyance! I don't put the bottles or nipples in the dishwasher so I know heat hasn't warped the nipples. I've tried refitting the nipples in the rings -- everything I can think of -- to no avail. Given that these are higher priced bottles, they should have a better seal. Would I still recommend them? Yes BUT only with forewarning about the leakage."
1,Disappointed in Avent bottles,"I wished I had read the reviews before purchasing the entire Avent Feeding System... These bottles leak horribly. I have had entire bottles empty themselves into the bottom of the diaper bag, and all over my newborn and myself. I feel for the cost of these bottles, the design leaves MUCH to be desired. I highly discourage everyone from purchasing this system."
4,Gas Relief,"Our one-week-old was requiring more fluids than I was personally able to produce, so we were forced to introduce the bottle. I heard many great things about Avent but decided to try the ""less expensive"" competitors first. What a mistake! Our poor baby suffered terribly from gas pain day and night. We tried all the tricks; sitting her up to feed, burping frequently, keeping her upright 30 minutes post feeding, but nothing worked until we started with Avent. If used properly, this nipple and bottle combination works great for gas relief. And when that means sleep without fuss, all mothers should be aware of this product."
1,Don't buy these bottles - they are garbage!,These bottles leak terribly - every time I fed my baby he got soaked in formula. These things are way overpriced and not worth it!
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THEY LEAK!!!,I chose these bottles because they were thought to be the best and most expensive on the market and was very disappointed. I got the whole system and later realized that the bottles leak! I had many frustrating nights changing my son's clothing at 3:00 am because he was completely soaked from these bottles leaking out of the side.It is very hard to tell how much he was getting considering that half of the bottle was leaking down the side. Every member of my family has tried to prevent the leakage and it is impossible! After all the money invested in this product I am very disappointed and do not recommend these bottles to anyone.
1,Leaking is so frustrating,I would not recommend these bottles to anyone. I have been told that untightening the top prevents leaking.....but I have found they leak when they are too tight or too loose. It is not easy to find the perfect tightness and I have spilled more milk on good furniture. They really need to fix this.
2,Not Impressed AT ALL !!!,"I have a 6 week old daughter and have tried using the Avent bottle to supplement breast feedings. Unfortunately, I have found this bottle to be worthless for anything except storing pumped breast milk. It is extremely difficult for my daughter to suck anything out of this nipple. I too have found leakage from the nipple ring, making for a very sloppy feeding session. I have since bought and used the Playtex VentAire bottles and haven't had any difficulties. The shape of the Playtex VentAire bottles are also much easier for feeding. I would not reccomend the Avent to anyone unless their baby has an impressively strong suck."
2,These bottles are the worst- they leak terribly!,"I had the same problem as everyone else...these bottles leak all over the place! I've switched to Playtex nursers, and they are great!"
3,Bottles Leak!,"I have used these bottles since my son was 1 month old. He likes the nipple and latches on well and this bottle has not messed up being able to breastfeed. However, I have the same problem as many of the others who have posted here...the bottles leak. I have tried many different ways of securing the top on the bottle, but it never fails that when I go to shake the bottle to mix the formula it leaks. This is not fun at 2:30 am. Seems as there is a flaw in the design. Other than this issue the bottles work well!"
2,Not as good as Born Free bottles,My son is 2 1/2 months old. We never have problems with our Born Free bottles but noticed that he cries and has stomach problems after being fed with the Avent bottles. I will keep them to use when he's older but they aren't good for newborns.
5,Quality product not made in China!,"I see a lot of complaints about these bottles leaking, which they do if the top is not on just so. I agree, they leak occasionally. Compared to other products, they are very well manufactured, easy to use etc. I would really give 4.5 but I didn't see an option to give a fraction of a star. These bottles are made in England which is a country with real wages, rules etc, and it is important to support countries and economies that are in tune with our own. Most bottles leak. I guess because these cost a little more it is dissappointing when they leak, but after a few uses, I was able to put the lid on so that they didn't leak, just practice. This is a good product."
2,"Not the safest thing to use, some leaks","I rate these a two because first of all we had a problem with them leaking.Secondly, and more important in my opinion is all of the research regarding the harmful effects and potential damage of using plastics, especially to reheat food in. Who knows what chemical changes occur in your breastmilk or formula when plastic bottles are used. The best choice is glass bottles, they are much cleaner and easier to sterilize. I wish I had known that when my baby was using bottles."
2,HORRIBLE,"These bottles are beyond horrible!!! There were times when I stood in my kitchen crying because my baby was crying and these bottles leaked all over the both of us!!! Please, please, please do not waste your time on these bottles. I know quite a few new moms that have tried these bottles and have had the same experiences! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
1,Avent bottles LEAK.,"Avent bottles leak between the bottle and the white collar. As a new mom, I was so impressed with the Avent advertising campaign I refused to &quot;believe&quot; other reviews on this site that the bottles leak. Now that I have been using them for the past three weeks, I have discovered that it is true. It does not matter how tight the collar is attached, or what nipple is used, they leak. I have tried a leaky bottle with other nipple/collar combinations and I have found that they still leak. I am not sure what aspect of the product is defective. It is a pain to have a bottle leak, wet the bottle bag, the car seat, or soak your newborn's onsies. I am very disappointed that I have invested a significant amount of money in avent products. I have over 10 bottles, the pump, and a few other items. I am going to switch to another system. I can't stand the frustration of having everything wet and the cost of loosing formula to soaking wet baby clothes. The &quot;End&quot;"
2,SURPRISE!!! WE LEAK!,imagine it's 2am...your baby is screaming at the top of his lungs...you are preparing his bottle...everything is put together correctly...so you pop the bottle in his mouth...and finally some silence...what's this...your sleeves are getting drenched...you look and it's milk...the bottle is leaking...what you thought your son was taking in...is all over his bib...shirt...and your sleeves...ARRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH...you pop the bottle out of his mouth...and the screaming starts again....there is one perk because the neck is wide...they are a lot easier to clean...but i rather spend my money on bottles that would keep the already too expensive formula in my baby rather than on my baby
1,Frustrating Bottles!!!!,These bottles were wonderful at first... but after washing them and trying to use them over and over it just got more and more frustrating because they leaked. I would tighten the lid and mix the formula and it would squirt everywhere. It usually took about 3-4 times of untightening and tightening back the lid. They also leaked out the nipple if it fell or got turned over. I finally decided to try a new bottle- Playtex Ventaire. I love them! They're a little more maintenance but there is NO leakage of any kind and my daughter no longer has gas problems either.BUY VENTAIRE!!!!
1,"Not for a newborn, don't waste your money","I thought these were going to be great bottles and my daughter had a lot of difficulty sucking from the nipple. My daughter is in daycare and the workers said most baby's have the same problem. If you look at the nipple you will see that it is nothing like ""mommy."" They also leak and you have to buy size 1 then 2 for the hole size. Too much to keep up with and a lot of expense if you ask me.I bought the Gerber bottles that average $1 dollar a bottle and they are great!! My daughter has no problem eating from the Gerber bottles."
2,So So Product,"Since my son was breast feed, the Avent silicone nipples were too hard for him. When he started to teeth, they came in handy because he enjoyed chewing on the hard nipples. He is now 1 year old and I am using the spouts, training cups and accessories that were passed on to me from a friend. Now the bottles leak and make a horrible mess with cold or warm milk. I plan to discard the bottles after replacing them with a few Gerber or Playtex cups.I feel that Playtex's feeding system is better for babies transitioning from the breast. The nipples are softer and have the same feel and shape of the breast. If I have other children, the Avent bottles will not be a part of their feedings."
4,dependable and likeable.,"I like the avent bottles a lot... the tops are extra wide to be able to put formula mix in, without getting it all over the counter. I don't think these bottles seem to help my son with gas, he's just a baby, and they are generally gassy. The bottles do tend to leak if the inside of the white ring is not completely dry first. Overall I've been pretty happy with them though, I've never contempated switching.**I do however recommend just skipping the 4 oz bottles and buying just all 9 oz bottles... My son is 3 weeks old and is already taking 6 oz, so anytime we use the 4 oz bottles, we have to make an additional 2 oz after he empties the bottle. I wish I had just registered for another package of 9 oz instead of 4 oz."
2,What a Waste of Time & Money!,"My son is now only 4 weeks old and I have been using these bottles since his birth. It seems that the more I wash and sterilize them, the more I get leaks in them. In the middle of the night feedings, he's getting all wet, and so am I. I try to fix the problem; he's screaming all over the place. Don't waste your time with Avent bottles."
1,Do not buy,"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating."
2,Not happy with bottle's design,"I was disappointed with these bottles. There was nothing in the literature with the bottles about having the lids too tight. I was having a problem with the bottles leaking so I assumed the first one was defective, so I threw it away. After having this problem with 3 other nipples and rings, I emailed the company complaining of the problem. This is where they told me it was because the tops were being put on too tight. I could buy that....but these tops are too touchy. You have to get it just right or it's either too tight or too lose and still leaks. It's frustrating when you have a hungry baby crying and you're too busy messing with the bottle to make sure it doesn't leak."
4,Great for newborns!,"I purchased the Avent Isis pump before my daughter was born, and when she was born she had a horrible time learning to latch on. She wasn't eating hardly at all so at 1 week old (after a week of feeding with a syringe while nursing...) we gave her a bottle. I really wanted to nurse her and was so afraid she'd get ""nipple confusion"" or not want to go back to breastfeeding. She did great! These bottles really helped her out, she nurses very well after using these bottles for 3 weeks straight. But now that she is 3 months old, she won't take the bottles, she spits it out and screams or it seems to gag her. She can eat with the Evenflo Sensitive Response Wide Nipples though, as long as mom is not around! I love that the avent products are all interchangeable...bottles, cups, pump."
2,It's a mixed bag,"I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had. I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed. I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts. I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts. Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?"
5,I love the versatility,"I had asked for these bottles when I was pregnant with my son. I ended up breast feeding exclusivly and never ended up using them. I found out that you could buy a ""sippy cup"" spout to use with them. My now 2 year old uses them daily. They ended up not being a waste of money because you could use them for more than just a bottle. The quality is really good and clean up is easy."
2,consistent and horrible leaking,How irritating to feed baby in the middle of the night with significant leaking from the bottle. I cannot believe that this bottle is even marketed any longer. These bottles have leaked from under the cap 9 of 10 usages. They are easy to clean with wide top and the nipple has a good shape but spare yourself the frustration of changing baby's outfit every feeding. Think twice about this product.
4,Overall okay bottle,Overall I like the Avent bottles. I have had problems with them leaking which is frustrating. The sippy cup attachment seems to let too much liquid out but this could also be because my baby is not used to it....she has only used it 3 times. I do like that the sippy cup attachment goes on the bottles as well as a cup
4,Great feeding system!!,"I have read some of the latest reviews, and I must say that I have encountered the leaking problem only a few times. BUT, it was easily fixed! All you have to do is wet the nipple and locking ring, and seal the bottle again. This has easily corrected the leaking problem every time. Plus, I always check the flow of the nipple before I feed my baby, so the leaking never soiled any of her clothes.Overall, the Avent feeding system has worked great for me! My daughter was already grasping the bottle (not entirely by herself) by two months. Now at four months, she is easily holding it because of the bottle's large body. As others have stated, the bottles are easy to clean and easy to use for preparing formula!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I have never used anything else...so there could be another bottle system that is better. But Avent works for me!"
4,Good Bottles,"I've tried platex disposable, regular bottles, and avent. This is my second child. The first being 10yrs old. I love the shape and size of the Avent bottles. Easy to hold and big mouth openings. I started having trouble with nipples leaking and thought maybe I had over boiled the nipples so I bought more. Then sometimes they would leak. What I discovered is that if one begins to leak I remove the nipple and then then reinsert it and it takes care of the problem. Evidentally when you put the top together when it is still damp it doesn't always make a good seal. Since I've figured that out I have no trouble with leaking any more and I do love the bottle."
3,"Alright, but not great","The bottles are very easy to clean, they have wide necks, which makes it extremely easy to put formula in without making a mess, but the nine or so I have all leak. I contacted Avent, who told not to tighten them all way, among various other things, which still did not help much. I actually believed I knew how to put a bottle together before this. The leaky top outweighs all the good factors about this bottle, I threw them out, and won't buy another avent bottle again."
2,not worth the extra money,"these bottles are a nice sturdy bottle, but when my twins were about 6 months old the bottles started leacking from between the plastic top and the opening of the bottle a real pain..., and they do not prevent gas like they say they do, gerber makes a botttle with a contour design same idea as the avent I haven't tried them but it is the same concept for less money."
2,Leaky!,"My pediatrician recommended these bottles as an easy transition from breast to bottle feeding, but they leak all over the place if not stored upright. It is so aggravating to go somewhere and find that your bottle has soaked your diaper bag and everything in it! My daughter also gags on the elongated nipple, and seems to swallow more air. We have since tried the evenflo bottles and like them much better."
2,Not what I expected--made baby VERY gassy,"I registered for these bottles since I heard wonderful things about them...but they made my son VERY gassy. He's cry all night in pain. I switched to Johnson and Johnson bottles and he hardly even burps anymore. So many people like these bottles so I wouldn't say not to try them, but for us, they didn't work out at all."
2,AWFUL and leaky!,"I agree with what I see a lot of people on here saying - these bottles LEAK! It's extremely frustrating, especially when you are expressing your own breastmilk and every drop is like liquid gold. I thought I was doing something wrong but then my husband and a coworker both complained to me at different times with different bottles (so it wasn't just one defective one). I'm going to return whatever I have that's not opened and get a different kind of bottle. This will teach me to read reviews first!"
3,Not So Great Bottles!,"I have seen a lot of Avent products and they seem to overwhelm the store shelves. So, I fell victim and bought the entire line of bottles. These bottles are great to clean as they are very easy to get around the bottle neck. However, the nipples collapse something terrible when my baby sucks. This would cause her to fuss and let go of the nipple and I could hear the air fizzing as it filled back up. This ruined the whole mealtime experience for my daughter. I was very disappointed and switched to Evenflo Sensitive Response System. They work much better and I don't have to tilt the bottle as she gets near the end of the bottle. They tilt to always keep the nipple full of milk. Wonderful!"
2,"Good bottles, but too small","I love the Avent bottles. My son (3 months) is exclusively breast fed, and he takes these bottles, and switches from breast to bottle with no problem. They're easy to clean with the wide tops. However, he outgrew the 4 ounces bottles pretty quickly - about 2 or 2 1/2 months. I would recommend getting the 9 ounce bottles and not filling it all the way. You're going to end up buying more bottles anyway."
5,GREAT BOTTLE SYSTEM!,"I HAVE A 1 MONTH OLD WHO I NEEDED TO ADD CEREAL TO HIS FORMULA AND NO OTHER NIPPLE OUT THERE ALLOWED FOR THAT. THESE BOTTLES ARE WONDERFUL AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE. I ORIGINALLY USED THE PLATEX SYSTEM BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER FOR WHERE I AM NOW. I WILL PROBALLY GO BACK TO THE PLATEX B/C I LIKE THE DISPOSABLE, BUT IT WILL BE A WHILE. PLUS THESE ARE PRICEY BOTTLES. I WOULD NOT USE THE AVENT DISPOSABLES B/C THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PATENTED NIPPLES THAT REDUCE COLIC AND SUCH. DEFINITELY WILL CONTINUE TO USE THESE THOUGH FOR A WHILE. HE ALSO QUICKLY ADJUSTED TO THIS NIPPLE, NO SPITTING UP OR EXCESS LEAKAGE FROM HIS MOUTH."
1,no time to fix leaks,"I am so sorry I asked for these bottles on my registry. No one in my family will use them including my husband. WHen we send our daughter to family members to be babysat, they actually tell us not to send her with these bottles. They leak and I find it ridiculous to pay all that money for bottles I have to struggle with while listening to a screaming hungry baby. We bought the multicolored gerber cheap ones and she likes those better. Plus, they don't leak. Like all things nowadays, you pay for the Avent name and not the product."
2,Too different,"My daughter hates the Avent nipple, she is breastfed and can't seem to suck on these nipples, even though she does fine with regular nipples. I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle. The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple. These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings. They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either. They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced."
1,Disappointed - they LEAK,"This is only my 2nd review ever but these bottles are so frustrating. Tonight they leaked all over baby again right after I put a new outfit on her. Finally got me online to write a review. They LEAK. The first month it wasn't so bad but now every so often they dump a ton of formula on me, the baby, the floor. For the price I was expecting much better."
3,My son hated the nipples,"I bought these bottles because I had heard how great they were when switching from bottle to breast. I introduced a bottle to my son at 4 weeks, and it was a fight to get him to drink more than 1 ounce in 20 minutes. I tried different nipple sizes thinking that was the problem. After 2 weeks, I gave up and tried different bottles. He does fine with the other bottles I've tried. For whatever reason, my son hated the Avent nipples. I think it was because the nipples were long and not very flexible. Sometimes he would gag when the nipple was in his mouth. The nipples on the bottles I use now are shorter and more flexible."
1,not what i expected,"My daughter is 10 days old i started the avents when she was 4 days old after i gave up on breast feeding they started out ok but when more milk ends up on her clothes and mine i thought it was time to change. The avent bottles leak way to much. I went and bought dr browns and they are 100% better the baby does not get too much milk because of the built in resovoir, I am trashing the avents and buying more dr browns."
1,Don't buy these bottes!,"I had registered for the Avent bottles, not doing my homework beforehand. These bottles are horrible! The nipples are way too big for my daughter (she is 5 weeks) and the formula runs all down her face and neck. I thought maybe the nipples on the 4 oz. bottles were the wrong size? I went out and bought the 1+ month size nipples and tried them. No change. And although the nipples on these bottles are supposed to be ""slow flow"" I found that they really aren't. My daughter was spitting up too much because she was consuming the bottle too fast. I switched to the Evenflo bottles and they work a lot better!"
2,junk bottles,"The avent bottle is supposed to reduce gas. Well it does considering that the baby does not get any of the formula in his mouth because it is to busy leaking out of the sides of the bottle. So there for, the less milk the baby eats the less gas he will have, right? No. My son had the same if not more gas while drinking out of avent bottles than any other brand. No mother has time to stand there and spend a minute carefully putting the top on a bottle so that it doesn't leak. You would think that the type of money we spend on these bottles the manufacturer would put a little extra effort in designing a top that doesn't leak. The avent bottles are the most expensive bottle on the market and they are not worth one penny. I have been very successful using Gerber bottles and playtex. I do not recommend this bottle unless you have a lot of patience and time to deal with it."
4,Please read the previous post,"Everything the last person post happened to me. When I shake the bottle, the whole thing leaked."
5,"Despite the ""Human Potential"" Clumsiness...","This is one book to read. If there are better translations,that's good, too, but, for me, this was quite an eye-opener.Dogenis THE philospher to bring up whenever you hear all this ""Western-centric""... thrown at you from conservative scholars and Christian theocrats. A contemporary of Aquinas, Dogen anticipated and surpassed Shoepenauer, Hegel, and other 19th century philosphers.Even if this translation is marred in places (and frankly, if you can read Japanese, ANY translation will be marred), the poetry and imagery of the original comes through. A voice from 800 years ago speaks, and comes to you. And you begin to see the man in the dew on the morning grass, in the meal you cook, and going to the bathroom."
1,"Poor design, poor performance","I purchased this item January 2010. I threw it away April 2010. From the first time I used it, I found the measuring cup difficult to adjust and difficult to read. The flexible rubber gasket that is attached to the inner tube is wide enough to hinder accurate reading and makes adjustment difficult. I followed the manufacturer's instructions, applying a thin film of oil to the gasket, but that only helped slightly. I started washing it by hand, hoping that would be easier on the gasket, but again, it only helped slightly. After less than three months use, the rubber gasket started ripping away, so now it leaked when used with liquids. Hard to adjust, hard to read and and not worth the money."
2,"Great idea, poor design","I really like the idea behind this, and it does serve the purpose of measuring sticky, semi-solid ingredients like honey, peanut butter and mayo without leaving half of it behind in the measuring cup. But the design does not work for me. You have to be very careful while filling it, otherwise the plunger moves around constantly and your measurement is no longer accurate. I find that being so gentle with sticky ingredients is a challenge, especially if you want to eliminate air pockets. I wouldn't recommend spending your money on these adjust-a-cups; I'd rather just use a small spatula to scrape out my measuring cups."
1,Very poor,"I have used this type of measuring cup for years. I needed a replacement for my last one as I wore it out. Within a few uses the measurement markings rubbed off on my hands. I was measuring basic cooking items, nothing wierd, and hand washing. Threw the thing out within a month."
3,Tar Bunny,I am so glad I found this. Does anyone else think it's ironic that they changed the tar baby to a tar bunny?
3,Not enough exam material!,I bought this and another book.. Both failed to prep me to pass the exam.. I feel that I wasted my money
3,"read the new version ""Reliable Distributed Systems""","Although the first version has a more general scope I really think that the author tried to talk about to many subjects.The new version of the book ""Reliable Distributed Systems"" is much better. It is true that in the new version the author mixes two different things: Web Services and Reliability in distributed systems."
1,Cheapness shows,"I watched Swan Lake on a library dvd. Loved it, watched it 50 times at least in the two weeks I could keep it.This 2010 reissue by Kultur, is of seriusly flawed sound quality. Certain effects are missing entirely. There are no liner notes which add so much to the original DVD. Without that information, such as the relationship between the press secretary and the Stranger, the plot is sadly murky. The ""tock tock"" sound as the swans attack is missing entirely, reducing the violence of the action.The buyer has a right to know what is included in the product and what is omitted."
4,Me he de comer esa tuna,"I ejoyed this Mexican romance movie. Even though the plot is uncomplicated, is funny and wholesome. No filthy innuendoes,which nowadays just about all movies have."
1,"Poor quality, poor QA, poor customer service","I bought this clock for my office. It arrived in good shape, but the plastic bezel and face are pretty flimsy plastic. There was a clear vinyl sticker on the face of the clock advertising something, which, when I removed it, left a residue that I could not remove with water or Goof Off. When I called Equity's customer service, they could not offer any help, and all they told me was to return it to Amazon, which I did (thank you Amazon for being much more helpful than the manufacturer)."
2,Another dead second hand...,"The clock set itself OK and keeps accurate time, but the second hand stopped working on this one like several others have commented after about a month of use. Every 15 seconds or so I can see the minute hand nudge forward a bit and the time is correct, but the second hand is frozen in place."
2,works but cheap made,This product set itself and is keeping time. It just looks very cheap and the face was scratched when I received it.
3,"Cute, but better when it comes with the song","Cute, but I would have liked to hear the song (I know they sell versions of the book with the cd)"
1,Creepy,"I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day this year. I didn't bother reading it when I was at the bookstore because I assumed it would be cute. Today I decided to read it before I wrapped it and it is down right creepy in some areas. The illustrations are cute, but the wording is strange and the poems are not well constructed. I especially disliked ""Won't you dance with me?"" I will not be giving this as a gift. i hope I can exchange it for a better book."
1,Awkward - at best,"Like many others I ordered this book after reading the description and assuming what it would be like based on many other such books I have seen. I don't really find the whole ""perverted"" vs ""not perverted"" debate necessary... it is just a strange book. Not at all what one would expect. It isn't phrased in a way that reflects the way mainstream America would view a father/daughter relationship. Do I find the ordinary activities in raising my child special? You bet. But the phrasing was just beyond awkward. I think diaper changing was a very cute idea for a sentimental topic, but it was just poorly executed. I think what should be taken from this is that it is wise to actually flip through books when possible to make sure they resonate with the reader. This one won't be a keeper for us. Then again, maybe I'm B-A-N-A-N-A-S."
1,Creepy,"This book is creepy and not appropriate for children. While the illustrations are gorgeous, the stories contain difficult and/or inappropriate words. Frankly, I am not sure who the target audience is."
1,Just weird,"I've never seen the word ""ecstasy"" used in a children's book before. Call me crazy, but I don't want my daughter asking me what ""ecstasy"" is for a loooooong time! Now I'm very open minded but this is just a weird and unfortunate choice of words along with some content others have mentioned. It's a shame since it is beautifully illustrated and would be fun to share. I wouldn't recommend it though."
2,Not so good...,"I was disappointed because I thought after all the good reviews this would be the product that finally worked for us. My dog has been suffering from chronic yeasty ears for 2 years and the vet's prescription meds are no longer working. The actual wash burned his ears he would yelp when I put it in. After a couple times he would no longer let me put it in his ears. I then tried Zymox without hydrocortisone which has since cleared them up perfectly. I may try the wash again now that his ears are cleared up, but I'm a little reluctant."
5,DRY EARS,I have persian cats that I bath. sometimes the water does get in the ear. I no longer have to worry about getting the ear dry without doing any harm to the ear drum. so easy to use and smell great too.
5,Very Much Worth It,"My Dell Inspiron 8600 running Windows XP with 512 MB RAM worked well up until a year or so ago. The amount of memory needed to run the system gradually creeped beyond 512MB and the system spent much time paging and thrashing, with very slow response for even trivial actions. I finally bought a single 1 GB sodimm to replace one of the 256 MB modules. Now it has ~1.25 GB of RAM and doesn't need to page any more, and is very responsive.Easy to install if you've done this kind of thing before. The included instructions are minimal, but no doubt you can google to find detailed directions on replacing memory, or consult the PC manufacturer's doc.Well worth the cost and trouble."
4,L-Arginine,"I bought this product instead of Vitamin Shoppe's other L-Arginine which has... I can't think of it right now, but another supplement with it. This is a great product that you can definitely notice an increase in strength and stamina in a matter of weeks. Plus coupled with the low-cost, makes this product a winner. Don't spend a lot more money for Nitrix, etc. they all just contain the main active ingredient L-Arginine and are selling a flashy bottle."
5,Study guide has great questions for test preparation.,"The questions and answers were so helpful in this book. I could test myself to see what I knew or didn't know for my college exams. The questions really were key to helping me get very good grades. I also highly recommend his Volume 2 and Volume 3 of The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology. If you want to increase your chances of getting excellent grades, I would definitely get these three books."
5,"I'TS GREAT ""I REALLY FELT THE MAGICK"" AMAZING|",I READ THIS BOOK THREE YEARS AGO FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND NOW I READ IT ONCE A YEAR THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT.I JUST WANTED TO THANK MARION FOR SHARING THIS WITH THE WORLDSO MOTE IT BE THANKS SO MUCH J. LUDDY

4,Classic Godzilla Suit,"I grew up watching Godzilla movies whenever they would hit late afternoon or late night (on the weekends) TV back before cable let you watch whatever you want whenever you want. Now it's great catching up on these ""classic"" Godzilla suit movies using the new tech, and this is one of the better ones! It has Godzilla, Rodan, and King Ghidra (Monster Zero) all in one movie PLUS aliens bent on taking over the world to boot! The hand built sets (which get stomped on and blown up) are wonderful, and the monster suits are still fun to see. Sometimes realism gets in the way of pure enjoyment, but not here! If you're a fan, this is one not to be missed."
3,"No rest for the wicked, eh?","Ghidrah, after having suffered an embarassing defeat at the climax of GHIDRAH, THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER, seeks revenge under an assumed pseudonym. Essentially, a re-hash of the former film (which is far superior to this one) with Godzilla and Rodan battling an old foe of theirs after the good guy scientists set them free. The only difference is that Mothra isn't in this movie."
4,"What has 3 heads, two tails, and shoots lightning bolts??","Ghidra, my favorite evil monster! I remember hopping all over the familyroom whenever he battled Godzilla! In MONSTER ZERO, we've got tricky aliens from planet X who try using Godzilla (Monster Zero 1), Rodan (Monster Zero 2), and Ghidra (Monster Zero) to take over the earth. They control Godzilla and Rodan's tiny minds, and almost succeed in their nefarious plot, if not for the kooky invention of one goofball scientist. With his machine, the aliens lose control of Godzilla & Rodan, who turn on Ghidra for a rubber-suited battle-royal! I just watched this with my 7yo and loved watching him bounce around like I once did..."
3,THIS MOVIE TOTALLY ROCKS!,"Spectacular special effects, X aliens, Godzilla, Rodan and Ghidorah make this one a winnner!!! It all starts when two astronauts(Nick and Glenn)one being Nick Adams(!)travel to Planet X in P-1...Buy this great movie to find out what else happens!"
3,why no subtitles ?,"I would give this film 5 stars, however the DVD only rates 3 because of its lack of a subtitles option . Of the recent releases of Godzilla films on DVD I have found none which give you the option of switching to the original soundtrack . Come on guys, we have the technology, stop being lazy ! If anyone knows where I can obtain subtitled Godzilla DVD's please tell me ."
4,"Good, but at times a bit somber","I credit this book for part of the reason I am currently knit-obsessed. Wonderful stories within about how knitting connects us to past generations, eases our pain and surrounds the person we give our handcrafted item to with love.While I truely enjoyed most of the stories, the somber ones relating to loved one's passing away seemed grouped together making it a bit depressing at times.All in all, a good little book to tuck into your knitting bag for when you don't have time to stitch, but you do have time for a quick story."
5,happy as hell,"i love this cartoon as a kid --- i still love he man today ---all we need no is she ra -- i also would like to postsomething if it please the fans ---Beginning this fall, BCI Eclipse will begin releasing the complete, 130 episode series in multi-disc ""season"" box sets, each including an abundance of extras that, altogether, will make up the most comprehensive collection of extras ever produced for a classic animation DVD series.

Producing the special features documentaries and most of the extra content is entertainment writer Andy Mangels, a best-selling novelist, and author of Animation on DVD-The Ultimate Guide."
5,He-Man is good,"After owning Transformers I had hoped they would release more of my childhood favorites. Now they have! He-Man is one of the best DVDs to own. It is still as much fun to watch today as it was then. Most of the episodes are fairly unique. My only complaint was that with only ten episodes, it leaves the viewer wanting more and not getting it. Highly recommend!"
2,"Time for political axe-grinding! ""Bring 'em on!""","Now that the right wing has trashed the Clintons, who is gonna trash the Bush's?Who will be the first pundit to blame 'W' for aiding the Bin Laden's and Saddam Husseins while profiting Cheney's Halliburton?To be honest, I am sick to death of conservatives trashing democrats and liberals tar-and-feathering republicans. It is time for a leader to stand up and speak out FOR something instead of AGAINST everything the other guy represents.Noonan has, this time, told us what's wrong with somebody. I wish this were the last such tome, but I know better. Noonan usually is good with the quip but tedious when going beyond a two-minute sound bite. This book is Noonan not at her best, but, should please her fans."
4,Mrs. Clinton's Character?,"This is a very short polemic on the character of the former first lady by Reagan speechwriter and author of ""What I saw at the revolution"" and other works. In this book the writer is alleging that Senator Clinton feels entitled to power, Noonan summarizes her involvement in a number of scandals. So many scandals and a good teflon suit. This book shows once again, as many other do, that Hillary cares about only one thing, Hillary. As with any book about Hillary Clinton, this book conatians some strong language. And is a fast read, so spend an afternoon and read it."
1,"Not quite hate, but resentment.","After reading Ms. Noonan's featherweight work on Hillary Clinton, I am reminded of all the other right wing hacks who have come to hate the Clintons for being so successful. This country has rewarded the foward-thinking centrism of Bill and Hillary Clinton with approval ratings that put even Ronnie Reagan to shame. That is the essential dillema Ms. Noonan and her co-conspirators face. It's nice to know the American mainstream has rejected this uglier part of the conservative movement. I hope the John McCain forces can reshape a party that once had a proud tradition. Instead they've settled for George W. Will Ms. Noonan be on-board to write junior's cue-cards?"
1,"objectively speaking, a horrible book","OK so I don't hate the Clintons as most of you reading this review do, but I'm no lover of them, either. I do, though, hate this book. Noonan, who has no business writing laundry lists, much less public speeches or books, is yet another snooty, upper-class twit who has it in for the Clintons. I read half of this book, became angry at the author's unfounded biases toward Hillary, and then I flung the thing across the room. A bevy of adjectives come to mind in describing this book: unimaginative, ""superior,"" elitist, narrow-minded, pro-wealth, jingoistic, mediocre, forgettable, cheap. And chances are that these same adjectives apply to the people who like this book."
2,It does not deliver,"This book is not so much an account of the misdeeds of Hillary Clinton (of which there are many) but a rambling, disjointed speculation piece about her. The author gives far too little factual material (which I was expecting) and far too much hypothetical fluff. There is no structure for this book. It seemed more of a lamentation than a ""case"" against anyone."
5,"I enjoyed it, despite myself...","I voted for the Clintons, and have thus been disappointed by the past 8 years. I've noticed other reviewers didn't like Ms. Noonan's stylistic choices, and I guess you have to ""get it."" These devices not only work very well, but her facts are on target and strongly supported, and her statements convincing. I usually don't read ""these kinds"" of books (for every book knocking the Clintons, there is another praising them...), but after numerous people recommended it, I bought it. You should buy it too. Not only for Ms. Noonan's sad but dead-on portrayal of Hillary, but also for her beautiful writing. I enjoyed it, despite myself."
1,1000 points of idiocy,"Peggy Noonan hasn't ever recovered from her prediction that Bill Clinton would lose in 1996. The resentments that have clearly built up in her since then have resulted in this condescending, unbalanced, unintentionally-hilarious and ineptly-written diatribe against his wife. However, it could serve as the basis for a satiric monologue about a bitter and irrelevant woman jealous of another woman's success."
4,It's Chapter 8!,"Chapter 8 is worth the price of the book!Peggy Noonan's prose flow easy over the mind. She's got a wonderful way with words, making her work, no matter the subject, a joy to read.But along with some fanciful dreaming and insight, there is a well thought out political point of view worth considering in The Case Against... ."
1,"Spew venom, call it editorial writing",This bit of vitriolic character assassination gives readers an interesting perspective into a former Republican speechwriter (one hears that Noonan is a writer of achievement): she hasn't the discipline to do her homework or provide even a vague semblance of balance. This is like reading David Duke's considered opinion of Jesse Jackson.
1,Waste of Time,"Note to Peggy: get over it! Next time, try to give us something objective. If we wanted propoganda, we would have gone to the RNC website."
1,DOG BITES MAN! DAY FOLLOWS NIGHT! REPUBLICAN SLAMS CLINTON!,"What a surprise! Noonan has written exactly what you would expect her to write. If you are a conservative, this book will fuel your anger over the Clintons. If you are a liberal, it will confirm your fears of the ""vast, right-wing conspiracy."" As a former White House speechwriter, Noonan never strays far from the script; instead she takes all the predictable shots and establishes nothing new. One hungers for the relatively balanced Hillary bio by David Brock."
1,A Case Against Hillary Clinton,"Peggy Noonan demonstrates her great talent and superb writing style. But good writing does not validate her case against Mrs. Clinton. On the contrary, this book is quite transparent in regards to the political agenda Mrs. Noonan is attempting to further. Mrs. Noonan miserably fails to provide the reader with an accurate account of Mrs. Clinton abilities and achievements in the public arena. This book is full of hate and driven by paranoia about an uncertain future."
1,I don't like Hillary but...,"Okay I don't like Hillary but this Noonan woman is bonkers. She actually writes thoughts in Hillary's head. Uh, pardon me? And she complains that Hillary could have done good things and instantly suggest some liberal cause as if it would be a ""good thing"". Heck that's just the kind of stuff I didn't want her doing! If Noonan thinks she is a Republican I suggest somebody better explain to her that means more than thinking Ronald Reagan is a nice guy. There are actual ideas involved.I gave up after a hundred pages but my wife stuck through to the end.I still remember when she finished the book, turned to me and said, ""this woman's an idiot"". And we're life long Republicans. 'Nuff said."
4,"Enjoyable, if unsettling","I hadn't read Weisman before, but trotted out and bought an earlier book right after finishing this. It's a very readable, intriguing book, with somewhat under-developed but appealing characters, and convincing plotting and ambience. I agree with the reviewer who said if half of this about the CIA is true, we're in big trouble -- and some non-fiction I've read recently suggests it is at least half-true. In that sense, the book was disturbing and frustrating, but since that was the author's goal -- good job!"
3,Starts strong,"John Weisman (best known as the co-author of the rogue warrior series) writes with great detail, drawing the reader into the exciting world of a CIA subcontractor. The main character races around the globe, uncovering details of a plot to utilize a new kind of untraceable explosive. Problem is the action fizzles at the very end. Its like Mr Weisman had a goal number of pages to write, and as soon as he reached it he ends the book.I will still give Weisman's other books a try because he has potential."
5,Stellar!! Outstanding!! Excellent!!,"Kim Klaver tells her story and the stories of others in a friendly easy-to-understand style, and at the same time she gives practical tips and suggestions for creating a script that will sell.Her no-nonsense approach to the subject is refreshing, since too often these types of books contain chapters and chapters of generalities and very little actual solid help -- this book gives step-by-step instructions, and includes samples of what to say that really work.Her websites are outstanding, too, and the tips she gives are real and helpful. Great book!!"
1,We think it's time to rest on your laurels,"Our Italian American family purchased this CD, but, frankly, we were very disappointed. There is absolutely NOTHING new, original or exciting about this CD. We suggest searching the Internet under ITALIAN MUSIC to see how many wonderful groups are out there, keeping the Italian American tradition alive. Don't waste you money on this CD!"
5,Wife loves these,My wife loves these Atomic Fire balls so I buy some every few months. Top quality and plenty to go around.
2,Would not order from Bice again.,"I thought I was getting the 200 count Ferrara Pan fireballs. However, there was no mention of Ferrara Pan on any of the packaging or candy wrappers. The package I got was 240 count and a bit smaller than I thought I had ordered. I compared to my daughter's package that she got directly from Ferrara Pan and the spicy lasted longer than the ones I got from Bice which give you some fire but it goes away very quickly and you're left with a bland tasting jawbreaker. We order these quite a bit through the year and this was my first with Bice and my last. Make sure you ordder the real thing and even though Bice markets on this site the Ferrara Pan name, the product makes no mention. All my other orders and my daughter's orders have Ferrara Pan clearly marked on the container and each individually wrapped candy. Very misleading."
1,"Product was opened. Tamper proof seal broken,",Product was opened and re-taped with clear box tape. Not cool at all. Last time UPS left on the porch while the sprinklers were on and it was completely soaked. Hit and miss with these. They are wonderful when you get the large size fireballs that are solid in the middle not so much so when you get the smaller ones or the softer ones that dissolve in your mouth readily and break when you bite on them. That is not what I would call a fireball.
4,The hot stuff,I ordered these for my husband. He loves them. The candy was fine but I had really hoped for the container as it was advertised. He's a truck driver and makes good use of those containers.
2,Buyer beware,"While you get 200 large atomic fireballs, it does NOT come in the display jar pictured on the sales page. You get the clear plastic container which is the second customer-posted image. It is false advertising - the item description is Atomic Fireball JAR. So if you're looking for something to display, don't buy this."
3,not as pictured,I ordered these as a gift and spent the extra money because I thought they came in the jar that is in the picture. Instead I got a regular clear container. Just not what I thought it was going to be. I could have purchased a larger quantity for less money and put them in my own cheap plastic container.
5,It was a magnificient movie,"I loved this movie from beginning to end. Jennifer Aniston was magnifique in her portrayal as the emotionally vulnerable Nina Borowski and Paul Rudd was excellent. To me, the movie was filled with emotions of love and lust that each and everyone of us feel when we love someone and can't have them. I thought to an extent that it related well everyone because all of us have been in the situation where the ""...object of ones affection shows rather less enthuiasm as one might have hoped"" I personally loved this movie and recommend it to anyone whose ever had there heart broken. Don't bother to see it if your a homophobe or a closet case because you won't like it."
4,Surprisingly and pleasantly subversive!,"For those who want their gays flaming and loud, go back to ""The Birdcage""--""Object of My Affection"" is not for you. If you want complex character and plot development, this movie is for you. Perhaps the only flaw is that there are so many characters and conflicts (not just sexuality but gender, race, and class as well), the movie is painted in broad strokes. But the movie doesn't slam you over the head with caricatures and stereotypes or a pat ending."
1,Pointless,The only thing about this movie that made an impression on me is that Jennifer Aniston's nose does in fact resemble a tulip.
1,Messy. . .Not worth your while. . .,Terrible movie with layers of convoluted plot to sift through. Would have us believe that society is an amorphous mess with jellybellies running things. . .stay away if you value your time.
1,BOO HISS,"Ranks right up there with 'My Bestfriends Wedding'! Hopeless romantics like me, like when the impossible happens, like, 'Pretty Woman', 'Nottinghill', and 'Dirty Dancing'. In our lives, we deal with disappointment and heartbreak daily...I certainly don't want to see it on video."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I thought this movie was supposed to be a romantic comedy. Wrong. I didn't laugh once and the only romance I saw was between Rudd and his boyfriend....not what I was expecting! Not that there's anything wrong with that (as Jerry Seinfeld would say), but it's just not the type of movie I would choose."
2,Skip it,"This movie is not horrible but its boring and doesn't really make sense. It tries to be a dark comedy but its not really funny. Its a stupid drama that will put you to sleep. Try Heathers, To Die For, something more fun."
4,Unbelievable true story of a fascinating era!,"The story involves love, adultery, incredible wealth, scandal- all in the beautiful Rockies. The book will have you hungry for more information about this fascinating woman. Her beauty took her from poverty in the dirty mining town of Leadville to Washington,DC where the President attended her scandalous and much talked about second wedding! She became one of the wealtheast women in the country spending sinful amounts of money.Great photos show her beauty.Would make a great movie. Drew Barrymore could play the part! There is a remarkable resemblence.The writing is unsophisticated but will keep your interest."
3,Tries too hard,"This book is not in the class of Laumer's Retief books. The 1st half is relatively straight-forward but the rest is a hodgepodge of activity--attempting, I believe, to combine SF with mystery. The ending has a twist, but wasn't very satisfying IMHO. Still, there's some innovative thinking and a good quote: ""What one doesn't understand seems arbitrary and meaningless."""
2,"Wobbly surface, cheap looking","I just got it today and put in the wall. It looks horrible. The inside plastic sticker with roman numerals is not properly glued to the clock. There is a huge bubble of air in the middle and when light reflects on it (yes, it is very shiny) looks like it is water damaged.Not sure if mine is defective or that is how all of them look like. Returning mine but not sure if to ask for a replacement or a refund. Are yours the same?"
3,Can't see hands across room,"The clock works fine for daytime, but in the dark in night glow mode, all we can see is the thick black cross in the middle, the extensions of the two hands are too thin to see. Since we couldn't read it at night and the glow on the wall was distracting in the bedroom we took out the night light batteries and just use it as a daytime clock."
1,Don't buy this clock!,"I am usually pretty generous with my reviews, but DO NOT BUY THIS CLOCK. The ""silver"" rim is made of painted plastic, the face is made of cheap plastic (that was scratched and cloudy when it arrived... not due to the packaging, either). The actual face on the inside of the clock is made of a thin plastic that was warped and looked like a clock from Dali's ""The Persistence of Memory"". I normally keep the items I order from amazon, even if they've been damaged by shipping, etc. but this one is NOT a keeper."
1,"Not accurate, not worth your time.","I picked up this book a while ago. After living in Saudi for about 12 years I was curious to see how a western author would describe Saudi. My conclusion after reading it is that the book is full of inaccuracies and generalizations. Instead I'd recommned several other books like The Kingdom: Arabia and the House of Sa'Ud, by Robert Lacey, Oil Monarchies: Domestic and Security Challenges in the Arab Gulf States, by Gregory Gause, and the best book I've seen written about Saudi that shows some of the cultural nuances of the country: Saudi Arabia and the Politics of Dissent, by Mamoun Fandy."
1,Irresponsible,"I read this book while living in Saudi Arabia, across the street from where the author lived. I'm surprised the book is still in print, and I am even more surprised that anyone continues to be impressed by it. Those who have spent more time there than the author, and who have made the effort to learn about the culture and context of Saudi behavior, will perceive the errors in many of her interpretations."
5,This will heal you,"Makes you very healthy and strong. Healing, calming, works fast. Put it on your gums to heal them. Take it daily."
2,"Bit of a Martha let-down, really...","I'm a fan of Martha, and I *love* Halloween music. When I heard she made a halloween album it was ""get out the credit card and call Amazon"" time. But this album was a disappointment--I'm going to assume Martha didn't actually design this, but just signed off on it, to maintain my faith in her.The sound quality is good--very crisp recording of ambient halloween noise. It's fine for background music for the trick-or-treaters. But for any other use it's flawed. There's only a single, album-length track, so no putting this one on ""shuffle"" for your Halloween party. The sounds repeat, so after 20 minutes of this, you start getting deja vu. And there aren't even ""themes"" in the album--no plots, which some of the more elaborate halloween SFX albums have (this is the ""torture chamber piece,"" this is ""Alone by gaslight stalked by Jack the Ripper...""I'm going to wait for an apology from Martha on this one."
1,Product was out of date from the year 2011,"The product came in out of date. this is the first time I've had this problem.I guess this product got out of rotation. so I threw them away.I have been a long time customer and I am unsure if I will reorder. Sorry,God Bless Ralph E Bard"
5,Kingdom Principles,"This is a great book, I believe that everyone should read it, Dr. Munroe really breaks down the Kingdom Principles and this book also lets you know that it's time to get serious about the Kingdom of God."
4,Excellent Read,Very enlightening. Changed my perspective about Kingdom principles and helped me to read thge Bible in a more understanding way.
5,Great Book,This book is a continuation from Rediscovering the Kingom. I enjoyed the in depth teaching and have gain an understanding of my position as a kingdom citizen. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the concept of kingdom mentality! Great Book.
2,"Disappointing Tract on ""Putting the Band Back Together""","Despite the author's starpower, an interview on NPR and other hype, and with a storyline that could appeal to lots of 60's would-be ""rockers"", the book never takes off and, in the end, is basically a disappointment. Winding its way through the lives of the former prep school musicians who record a vanity album which is resurrected by a record collector who wants them to reform and hit the road, the narrative explores the failures and foibles of the guys in an effort to build towards that ""big gig"". I won't spoil the ending for those who still want to read the book, but there's plenty of reunions of old band members going on out there at clubs, weddings and the like and you'd be better served by going out and seeing the real thing....even if all you'll hear is a warmed over version of ""We Gotta Get Out of this Place""...at least it's live."
2,A Loyal fan of Matchbox Twenty,"When did people start thinking it was ok to sell out, take the last nickel and dimes on the floor and run back to their Hollywood home. People want to hear the awesome sounds of MT not this new latin pop star, I don't enjoy his solo music as much as I love MT."
2,It's probably a good CD,"but I wouldn't know because when I got my copy (not ordered from Amazon) it was this super thick disk that was bigger than all my other CD's and won't fit in my CD player. As a result I'm afraid to try it in my car becuase I don't want it to get stuck.But since ABC is using one of the tracks to promote it's new fall lineup, I get the idea....Maybe I'll just download them from ITunes..."
1,uve got to be kidding,this is the cheesiest music ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!any body who thinks this guy is good is mental. sure he was good in matchbox 20 but not in this!!!!!
4,Rob Thomas Rocks!,"Just got the cd a couple of days ago and was pleased with Rob Thomas's solo debut. The first three tracks are great. This Is How A Heart Breaks, Lonely No More ( his hit song climbing the charts now and receiving tons of airplay), and Ever The Same. He also has some very relaxing and subdued ballads on the album such as When The Heartache Ends and My, My, My. One of my favorite tracks is All That I Am. It is very haunting and mysterious sounding. You can really hear the Asian inspired influences throughout the song. Overall, a really great album. Just go out and get it and you will be treated to hours of listening pleasure."
2,What happened here?!?!?!,"I too bought this CD with the hope of listening to that beautiful singer/songerwriter music that Rob is so great at. Only one song, ""Here Comest The Night"" was good enough to meet that quality. This is NOT the Rob Thomas that I've come to love. Sure I expected a change from the MB20 scene, but bubblegum pop CD, I did not expect. I long for the songs like the last title. All of these songs had promise. They all have wonderful lyrics, but have been processed so much that they are no longer pleasant to listen to. I look forward to the day when Rob rejoins the rest of the MB20 crew!"
2,just Ok at best,"Rob Thomas should have done this about 4-5 years back when He was rolling with Santana from the Hit song""Smooth"". Thomas trys his hand at trying to flip the script of His previous sound with Matchbox 20&He is met with Mixed results. some of the material here is hit&miss but the biggest Problem is that Vocally He just doesn't add anything.His voice is always just kinda there&he lacks any emotion or anything."
3,"DualDisc is not a ""real"" CD: caveat emptor!","DualDisc may be good in theory, but the CD wouldn't play on my iMac G5 (slot-loading drive). I was able to read it on another Mac I have at work, but I've heard very spotty success in ripping the music to a computer. The DVD side always seems to work, but not the CD side. The record label is covering itself by claiming in fine print that it may not read in all CD players (it doesn't have the ""Compact Disc Digital Audio"" logo), but computer drives seem to be particularly susceptible. Overall, I was able to read it on one Mac (G5 PowerMac) but not an iBook, iMac G5, or a old Dell PC I had at work. Buyer beware if you're planning on ripping the songs to your computer to place onto your iPod or other MP3 player."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was a big Matchbox20 fan, so I looked forward to listening to this disc, expecting to find music that was ver similar. There were two songs on this disc that were decent, the rest were below average to bad, including about 3 which consisted of a fair amount of yodeling (I am not kidding). It wasn't at all what I expected or wanted, and even adjusting for that, it wasn't very good.On the positive side, the disc does have some DVD content on it which will make for a better value."
1,Makes Matchbox 20 look like AC/DC,"Rob Thomas should go on a retreat in the west indies along with John Mayer, Chris Martin, and Jason Mraz to finally decide once and for all who is the king of prissy bland male rockers. This album should be one of the items sent out into deep space to hopefully be intercepted by aliens so that they know not to bother with our awful planet."
2,"Ok, but not the Rob that I love to listen to....","Great effort, but I was really disappointed here. I love Rob Thomas' voice, but I just didn't hear a whole lot of it here. He has such a strong, powerful voice that is usually FILLED with emtion and personally, I found this album lacked his usual power!I think he is trying to appeal to the Justin Timberlake crowd - i.e., younger crowd and I find that not to be his style (this try-to-be-boy-band??). I don't like the new look and/or image. When I saw Lonely No More video, my very first thought was - ""Augh... George Michael!"" 2nd thought was ""Oh, Rob, don't dance""!Get back to the roots, sing raw and with emotion! This album simply lacks emotion.Anyway... my 2 cents worth"
3,Matchbox fans beware,"Fans of Matchbox20 will immediately recognise the style of lyrics produced by Rob. But if you are going to buy this album hoping for another Matchbox outing beware. There are hints at Mad Season and More Than You Think you are, especially in how a heart breaks; but it is definately a unique album to Thomas' credit.If anything this album shows how Rob is definately not the only influence behind the success of his bread and butter band."
4,language,"Language is so important for nowadays world. Therefore product for learning english is getting important, and on internet we can ind that much helpful dictionary. Every Turkish or English learner have to have this dictionary."
1,quality was poor,"i like the content, but not the quality of this particular book. towards the end of the book (about 10 pages) the tops of the pages were not cut and still stuck together. i think something was not aligned when these pages were inserted. i had to cut it by hand and now some pages, the top edges are ruined. i was very disappointed in the condition."
5,sumo lite - a real heavyweight,"I've never forgiven myself for not biting the bullet and snapping up the original Sumo book at what is now a rediculously cheap price. Thank you June Newton for making most of my pain (envy) go away. Your Sumo Lite version punches way above it's weight. Helmut Newton's images are so powerful they really don't need size to impress. Every image is a tribute to his unique ability to empower women, to make them look strong, in control, never making them appear vulnerable or weak. If anything, he, as the photographer, looked like the one being manipulated, directed, being told the way the women liked to be portrayed. And only a master can pull off that kind of magic."
2,"""in your face"" but nothing new","yes, many people would say this is a wonderfully erotic book to bring out your sensual side, but it's nothing new, just big. Every foreign bookstore in Japan has it hanging on every wall and table trying to grab your attention (which is not hard to do considering the book is what, 4 feet square and has a giantic picture of a naked lady on the cover)? Upon investigating the inside the book you will find nothing different from your typical run of the mill ""artsy"" advertisement. Best spending the ...bucks elsewhere."
1,Boring,"Just what we need: another compilation of women's music. I love female singer/songwriters, but this collection is incredibly boring. Sarah McLachlan sounds beautiful on Unchained Melody but it will most likely put people to sleep. I Know by Sarah Sleen is beautiful as well, but overall this collection is boring."
4,Useful but lacking info on older babies,"This book has been very useful for me and my 4 children. I found the subject of the use of herbs with children broad, but lacking for children under 1 year. The many tips and recipes were wonderful and easy; the charts were helpful, and the ""when to see your Dr"" was especially useful.I give it 4 stars for lacking matter for older babies and also because it is very pro-vaccination and there's almost a bias against those that choose against doing so. However, the mention is minimal, so if you can overlook the few mentions of the vaccination issue this is a very wonderfully written and useful book."
1,Diaper Genie II SUCKS,"I wish I had gotten another Diaper Champ but I didn't... I liked the idea that the dirty diapers would be bagged. I thought this sounded like a great product. I read some positive reviews. Here's how it works though. You change the baby's diaper. It's a messy, wet #2. You roll it up as best you can. Then you reach over to your genie. With one hand you open the lid. The other hand then has to push the dirty leaky poopy diaper into the genie. You actually have to push this nasty diaper down pretty far. The problem is that to get it past the stink gate, you have to apply force... causing contents to spill out onto your hand. It's disgusting. It's like they didn't actually test it on babies. My diaper champ is so much better. You drop it in the hole and flip the top for it to go down. Enough said. Diaper Genie II sucks. I regret the purchase."
2,smelly and inconvenient,I would recommend the Diaper Genie Elite. This one does not mask the odors at all and you have to manually push the diaper through a trap door so you have the potential of squeezing poop out everywhere. The diaper genie elite has a trap door that automatically opens when you lift the lid.
1,"BEWARE - Doen't hold in smells! They said it was improved over the original, but it's not!","I bought this to replace the original Diaper Genie because it was rated so highly for odor containment... BAH HUMBUG! It smells every time you add a new diaper. Just ONE poopy diaper ruins the room. I could've sworn it said you didn't have to push down with the diaper, but you have to push it down through a trap door. Once that trap opens, out come the smells! I'm using our old one and donating this one!"
3,Not very good,"I dont find it very good because when you put a diaper in it , it opens up and the smell is not covered then....otherwise i have no problems with it... it does not leak smell or anything but while putting a diaper in it it definitely leaks and needs to be improved."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"We registered for this product a year ago when I was pregnant with my son. I was excited when we received it, as it was deemed the latest and greatest thing on the market at the time. Well, it may have been the latest, but it has proved to be less than great. It was ""somewhat"" adequate in odor control before our son started solid foods (as long as we changed the bag every 2 days or so) but now, it fails in all respects as far as containing odor. Absolutely every time you put in a new diaper (and sometimes just opening up the lid) the smell hits you right in the face. My husband and I fight over having to change his diaper, but not because of the current change required -- rather, we just dread having to go in there and opening up the diaper genie to make a new deposit! Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Terrible design!,"I am very disappointed with this new and ""improved"" diaper genie. Every time I open it up to put a new diaper in, the wonderful smells from previous diapers come shooting out. In my opinion, the old diaper genie was much better. At least it kept the smells in. I would recommend buying a different system that twists the individual diapers, therefore keeping the odors in."
3,Average.,Works but not exactly as well as advertised. Locks in some odors I imagine but not odor free by any means. We keep a box of baking soda in the bottom of it to help and still have to change the bag every two days.
1,Changing pad covers,"Unfortunately, these feel flimsy and cheap. Would not recommend buying. They also crinkle underneath my daughter while she squirms on the changing table."
1,"Great item, rip off pricing.","This item was exactly what I needed but for some reason I thought I was getting a lot more than I got. My fault, sure, but it doesn't really excuse selling $3 worth of something for $10, does it?"
1,You could find better...,"Get Running Linux. This Dummies book does have some good information, but you would do better to spend a few extra dollars on a better one than have to go out and purchase a whole new book when Linux for Dummies runs out of stuff to teach you. And that'll come fairly fast. Don't kid your self, you can not learn Linux in 12 hours or with a superficial book like this one. So spend an extra $10 and get Running Linux, or even something better."
2,Could be so much better,This book trys to to do everything and comes out with very little. It has no information on any commands and many of the subjects that are covered in the book are not relevent to the audience.
3,Good for Getting started with the program but not everything,"Linux is a very complicated OS to learn. This Book is deffintly good for getting information on how to load it and stuff. But when you get stuck the author wrote ""Go find someone to help you."" Well that doesn't help me at all. because I'm stuck on a problem which won't let me read the rest of the book until I can get past that part."
2,Only buy the book for the CD,"The book was alright to a point - the end of the install. After that, you're on your own.The book basically tells you how to get Linux installed. If you are looking for a good reference on how to use Linux, get a different book.Also, when I tried to recompile the kernel, I was lost. The book was not helpful there.Too much time is spent explaining how to get your PC's info (IRQ settings, etc.) from Windows/DOS. What if we're not using Windows??? What if you have a new PC???"
1,Five pounds into two pound bag,"/I never got farther than the second chapter.My system looks at the CDROM drive first when booting up, however for some reason I was unable to boot from the CD no matter what I tried.If unable to boot with the CD, you might have noticed that the boot.img that you need to put on a 1.44MB floppy is 1.74MB.I wonder how the authors did it.My point is that if you can't load the OS, the rest of the book is worthless.I've noticed that the authors have written a 4th and 5th edition. I wonder if they give a clue to the floppy trick."
1,A confusing book,"In addtion to what has been said by others, installation process described in this book is not consistent with the actual installation process. I could install Linux because I followed Red Hat's wizard.Has anyone successfully set up an internet server yet? The NCSA sever, which is chosen in this book, is not available any longer.If a book is needed for Red Hat Linux and its installation, Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours should be chosen."
2,Only for the tech that knows linux-then it is incomplete,"The book is much like the rest of the linux documentation. It appears to be haphazard in its content. Instructions appear to be made for either those that understand Linux or those that only need help with the specific subjects of the book. The installation instructions are not much better than those found on the Red hat installation guide. Some of the specific screen illustartions are either out of date or do not match those that come with the operating system supplied.Suggest obtaining the Que guide rather than This one. The Que Using Linux guide will be much larger, but, it does cover more aspects of the Linux system."
4,A great book for first-time users of Linux,"Linux can be complicated, but Linux for Dummies is straightfoward and easy to understand. With Linux for Dummies you will never be confused about Linux again."
3,For true fans only,"This DVD box has almost all of Michael Jackson's important interviews (Oprah 1993, Diane Sawyer 1995, Barbara Walters and many more), BUT because of copyright restrictions the original TV shows were cut whenever Michael's music appears (including him singing ""Who Is It"" a cappella on Oprah!). Which means: you get all the all the great interview content that fans are looking for, but not the entire original TV broadcasts. ;-(Since this is not an official MJ product the DVD menu and image quality are halfway decent (as if you had it recorded yourself on your VHS or DVD recorder), but nowhere near a crisp and clear state of the art digital release.GREAT for hardcore fans who want to own the footage but nothing for high quality MJ lovers.P.S. The very interesting Martin Bashir ""Living with Michael Jackson"" film is not on this collection (only little bits from MJ's own personal camera man when Bashir was interviewing him)"
1,Mistitled,"This book has a number of faults, but the most glaring fault is the title. Some people will be lured into purchasing the book thinking that it's a ""how-to"" manual, which the title implies. The title should instead be ""SAS: The Unofficial Cursory Overview"". There are a few token ""how-tos"" thrown in like the diagrams for building snares in the wild that look like they were dreamed up as part of a Saturday afternoon Cub Scout project, or the ambush formation that would have allied troops shooting toward each other across a road. You can also learn about other highly strategic and clandestine maneuvers and survival techniques like how to do a push-up and how to build an igloo. Even the pictures are very generic and do little to support the text..."
1,Is there a zero star?,"The link remover is made of plastic. However the push pin itself is made of metal. The wrench remover is made of metal. However, it was very very difficult to adjust the prong width on the tool. I would not buy and would not recommend anyone else to buy."
2,"While sometimes enticing, this is not one of Archer's best.","The Fourth Estate had it's moments, but I have to agree with the other readers in that it's not one of Archer's best. There weren't the usual surprises, and I really didn't care what happened to the characters. If this was your first Archer novel, keep reading! I must recommend ""Honor Amoung Thieves"" and ""Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less"" as my favorite page-turners."
1,A PROFOUNDLY BORING BOOK,I consider every minute I spent trying to get into this book a waste of time.
3,ok,"I liked Kane and Abel and As the Crow Flies much better. His characters are similar in many books, this one especially."
2,Nothing new and captivating,"It takes some efforts to finish the book. At first I thought it is ""Kane and Abel"" with a different cover but after reading the Fourth Estate, I found it is nowhere near ""Kane and Abel"". Disappointing"
1,Poor Workmanship!,The Glass was chipped where you have a second hole for heat to release. It looked like it was shot with a BB Gun. The Center whole was not in the Center it was off to the side so the bottom Final was off center. Made in China but sold to Americans by Americans. Not worth the time sending it back. I will not buy from Amazon.com LLC again as they do not check the quality of what thye sell!
4,"Fusion of Neural Networks, Fuzzy Sets, and Genetic Algorithm",Looking at the content of first 14 pages it seems that this book is going to be a very good reference for the researchers as well as beginers of the Evolutionary computing in Control. The conceptual part is also good as it can help beginers to get in to cognitive approach to the problem as tradinational methods are not useful in real time application and can now only used for comparision. Very Good Approach from the Editors.
3,Works OK,"The owner's manual was actually a set of photocopies from the original, and the pages were all disorganized. So I cut the pages out, rearranged them, and placed them into a binder, with sheet protectors. Now, I can find what I need to know.It's rather tricky to do certain things, and some parts are a bit complicated. But once I learned how to use this product, it was OK. The only defect is a bad button on the remote (and it's not essential).It's good for dubbing VHS tapes onto DVD-R's. That is if the tape doesn't have a tab that prevents dubbing. This take a little practice. Once you have it down pat, you can edit your DVD-R's, but it's hard to fix any mistakes.It also does well reading a CD-R with a photo slide show. I put the pictures in the JPEG format, and load onto the CD-R using Adobe Photo Elements. It's time-consuming, but not too difficult. I don't know if this will work with BMP or other photo formats."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"After having owned this for just over a year, the unit rejects nearly 3 quarters of all my Dvd discs due to the proverbial 'cannot read disc' error. I tried recording several vhs tapes to various dvd media without any success. This may simply be an isolated problem, but nonetheless, my previous combos (other than panasonic) lasted years longer, under rigorous use. I'm currently shopping for a new brand because it wouldbe cheaper than repair. Fair or not, I cannot recommend panasonic.. in fact, I'll actually enjoy tossing this one."
5,Works great,"No idea what the guy from Bethesda was talking about. I've had this for about three weeks now and it works great. No problems at all. This is just like using a VCR but you can record more stuff and/or at higher quality. Be sure to get good blank DVDs, though, as that makes a difference in quality and storage shelf life. If you don't need the VCR go with the Panasonic models without VCR and you can save some money. (Although, good VCRs are hard to find these days, so if you have lots of VHS tapes this one is perfect.)"
2,Wrong model !!!,"I choose this product from the official catalog of ACDelco, then look on amazon, and both pages (Amazon y AcDelco) said that it was compatible with my Corolla 2002 but when I went to the mechanic told me that they were not compatible."
1,Topper Takes a Trip (1939) VHS -- Colorized!!,"Beware! This is a wonderful film, not yet available on DVD, but at least one of the VHS versions being sold has been colorized--which is a hideous and disrespectful thing to do to a great old black and white film. It would be helpful if Amazon could include this information on its sale pages. (In this case, the reproduced VHS box cover does include the word ""colorized"", which I didn't notice.) Since they don't, before buying a VHS, if getting the original B&W matters to you (and I hope it does), then inquire carefully of your seller. I got a VHS from Video Treasures, it was colorized, and I returned it."
2,approach with caution,"The hero whines a lot, suffers inexplicably over things that don't seem too troublesome, and is loved unreservedly by every good guy in the book. The heroine is annoying, wanting to be present at all times and tagging along even when not supposed to -- this is supposed to make her a ""strong"" female character rather than the pest and burden she really would be?The young McKillip hasn't yet learned how to shape a story, develop characters, or create suspense; the story is choppy, episodic, and at times inexplicable. There is much -- way too much -- description of emotion, but no creation of emotion in the reader.I'm being a little brutal, but this is an immature work that will appeal mostly to teens and to those who haven't read much adult fiction."
5,best Guide for Maui,Just got back from Maui and this book was extremely useful. Honest and helpful in terms of good places to go and places to avoid. We were able to go to places not well known that had spectacular views on the island. An absolute must for anyone going to maui for the first time
5,Look no further - buy this one!!,"Just returned from a week in Maui staying at the Sheraton in Kaanapali. This guidebook was great (and easy) reading, humorous and spot-on with descriptions of out-of-the way places and how to get to them. Written by people who live and know Hawaii and more importantly, how to present a useful guidebook. [...]. This book made a great vacation all that much better."
3,Penultimate Guidebook,"Good writing, (or good ""talk story,"" as Hawai'i folks say) but some difficulties, like following the directions to an eating place using the inadequate area maps."
5,Maui Revealed is Awesome,"Last year I bought Kauai Revealed for my honeymoon and that book was AWESOME!! So this year we are heading to Maui for our 1st anniversary and I purchased Maui Revealed and I have read through it two times already highlighting with sticky tags everywhere we want to go. Everything about these books is great, the directions to hideaway beaches, food places we never would have found, awesome hikes, the information they provide is dead on. I have purchased other books like these but these Revealed Books are the best."
2,wrong edition,"I didn't realize they sent me an outdated version of this book until I got to Hawaii. Everyone else in our group had the latest edition (5th edition) and I was sent a 2nd edition copy by this company. If you order this book from them, make sure you are getting the latest edition. The updates do matter."
5,Make your trip to Maui even better - read this book,"My husband and I just returned from Hawaii this morning. I purchased this book on a friend's recommendation. While in Maui we rented a car and this book was our tour guide for everything from the sites worth seeing to the restaurants to visit to the best places to shop. This book was so worth the money and I would tell anyone who is planning a visit to Hawaii to pick up each and every ""Revealed"" book!"
5,Identifies places that are literally off the map,"Have traveled many times to Maui, and thought we knew all the hot spots. After thumbing through this guide, we decided to try Nakalele Blowhole on the North shore. This location is not on the map, and no signs will direct you there. One tip - unless you are into intense, no- or little-trail hiking, take the second route identified in the book. Awesome site, with little tourist traffic. We had been 200 yards from this spot before and never noticed it. This is just one example of the type of information you will get from Doughty in this book. He uses mile markers to guide you to the precise points to turn off. His descriptions are direct and objective. He also includes insights on local lore and enough history to help you appreciate the context of the sites, without bogging down the guide."
5,Best book and the only one to buy,You will be among the many visitors who are traveling to Maui with this book. But that is OK. There is so much great stuff in here that you will also be one of the only ones visiting that great snorkeling spot or visiting the cool side road eatery. Read it from front to back and pick out what interests you the most and do them. You will not be disappointed. We loved this book.
5,One of the best traveler books,"It is great, big, lots of info., I personally highly recommend this book to everyone, from fist time traveler to expert travelers.Great pictures, maps and useful info about hotels, condos, attractions and more. One of the best for HAWAII.AAA+"
4,Great for anyone except families,"I bought this book on a recommendation from someone who has been to Maui before with children. I should have looked it over more carefully before leaving, but I was short on time so I didn't get to really look at it until we were on the plane to Maui. This is a great book for discovering the out-of-the-way spots on Maui, and a true guide to the places to stop as you travel the island. But it is NOT for families. The only mention of kids/keiki snidely says something like ""maybe this should go under Hazards."" If you need to know whether a place/activity is kid- or family-friendly, you'll need to look elsewhere. It's not a flaw of the book; I fault myself for assuming that this book would be great for us based on one recommendation. If you're traveling without kids, I highly recommend this book. But families or anyone traveling with children should look elsewhere."
4,great guide - too bad everyone else has it too,"This is the only Maui guide book we kept (out of 5) after our trip -- just in case we go to Maui again some day soon. I agree with other reviewers that some of the hikes could use more detail or maps. In general, however, this is the best guide we saw of the several we had. Unfortunatley, every other visitor to Maui seemed to have the same book, so the ""secret spots"" were flooded with other like-minded tourists. Of course, this is not the fault of the writer. This is a very good book for anyone traveling to Maui."
1,Ignorance can be really funny.,"I don't think I have read a funnier book in all my time. What made this book hilarious, was that it was not trying to be a wacky book. The Illuminati is a novel so poorly written (A ten year old has better grasp of the language), and so full of prejudice (Pat Robertson has it next to his toilet), you will find yourself laughing and groaing at the same time. One hopes that Burkett would crawl back under his rock and never try joining the literary world again. Even though ignorance can be really funny"
2,Not a very good book,"This book is filled with Christian paranoia, and stereotypical references to youth, gays, other religions and government.Scattered with fantastic events but hard to believe any of them, from futuristic computers that can tract everyone in the country to super dooms day weapons and corruption of government. I guess if I was paranoid that the government was planning to out law Christianity I would really like this book, but as it is I forced myself to finish this book, only because I don't like to start a book and not finish it."
1,Absolutely no intellectual appeal,"The characters are shallow and stereotypical, little more than charicatures. The villains are mindlessly violent and unhuman, little more than reptiles. The heroes are saints without a shred of human weakness. The books starts out suspiciously biased and finishes in a crescendo of unmasked right-wing fundametalist doggerel that categorizes all pro-choice and drug legalization opinions as products of Satan himself. Quite hillarious is the complete absence of sex in what is supposed to be a book about international intrigue. The good guys win and the bad guys lose by no plausible reason but by the grace of God. Simplistic and uninteresting. Struggled to the end just to see how completely the author could lose himself in his own thinly veiled trilling of ""Hallelujah! Praise tha Lord!"""
3,Trend Lab Max Window Valance,"The quality of the valance is nice, for the price its good. The Max color is listed as 82"" though, and in reality its only 53"". We had to wind up ordering two to fit our window."
2,Ugh,Not nearly the quality I was looking for.. too flimsy and not very pretty in real time. Would not recommend
4,I got it for a $. Good book for unbeatable price,I ordered this book along with few other items and I recieved this for a $ and the shipping is also free. I really liked it.
3,"Not bad, but...","This unit loses the signal when it heats up - I like to listen to it at night, and I needed to put a small fan close to the unit to keep it cool. Once that was done, it works OK."
4,Thing is built like a Tank!,"I have had this receiver almost a year and have dropped it three times on pavement and it still works! The other day it slipped out and the top actually split open, and then I heard something rattling inside. I thought for sure it would never work again but it does with no problems. I have not even replaced the remote batteries yet!I drive truck at night and have a cradle for it in each of my personal vehicles so it gets alot of use.The only thing I do not like is the red colored screen. It is hard to read especially at night in the dark. Would of been better to have the font black instead of light colored or the whole thing blue. It is a little large but I like the larger buttons rather than small."
2,Not As Good As the Earlier Books,"I am starting to lose my patience with the Carrier series. Ever since the publisher started putting the books on a six or so months sched, the quality has really taken a nose dive.In this book, the character development is really poor. Instead of getting to know the odd aviator or seaman, they all seem to be interchangeable parts with similar dialogue. I can't tell at times whether Batman or Coyote is doing the talking.It seems that the plotting is out of control. In the earlier books, the secondary and diplomacy scenes helped the plot, but in this book they distract from the main plot.The last three books have been the worst of the series and I am at the point where I have almost given up. It seems when the author spent the time to write, the book was good. If you really want to enjoy this series, read the first eight books.I'd rather wait a couple of years to get a good book than get mediocre stuff every six months."
2,still hanging in there,"this is fairly typical of the last few books in the series, unresolved sub plots, shoddy editing, implausible scenarios. But the next one starts getting the series back on track.The thing that disturbs me most is that the author barely mentioned an important recurring character at the beginning of book 16, killed the character off at the end of book 17 after not being mentioned anywhere else in the story, and then in books 18 and 19 acted as if the character disappeared in book 16 not 17. He's writing the books so fast he can't even keep track of his own characters."
5,Hard to put down,"As a true crime book fan I always wondered why no one wrote about this murder. You have a rich well known victim - a out of control, greedy daughter who gets away with murder.This book is well written and for the first time the whole story of the murders, as well as plenty of back ground into the killers is given.The historical back ground of the Condon family and others is intermixed within the plot and unlike most crime stories was worth reading."
4,Modern-Day Political Thriller,"A bombshell of a political thriller, the sequel to McCarry's The Better Angels. A tense and riveting tale of a struggle for presidential power, and the human and political consequences it leaves in its wake. Loading his story with rich, detailed characters, McCarry proves his mastery of the political spellbinder as well as the spy novel. You will be hungry for more!"
3,3 and 1/2 stars,"Well after the very disappointing and very stupid `Screaming Death', I didn't have much hope for `Bite Me'. But hey c'mon a movie about mutants, marijuana, and strippers, how can they go wrong? Fortunately, this flick was alright.Missy Mundae is her same sweet little self. She is one of the strippers and if you like seeing Missy in the buff, this flick will definitely not disappoint you. There's plenty of T&A; to go around for everyone. Missy has a great nude scene in the shower right before her bug attack.Well the spiders are funny. I was surprised how well done the special effects were considering the budgets these movies usually have. It was cool how they bloated with blood after biting their victims.So all in all there's not too much of a story. The strip club owner makes a weed deal, there's bugs in the weed, and mayhem ensues."
4,"Is ""Creating Tradition"" an Oxymoron?","From a lay perspective, ""tradition"" arises from a repeated series of human acts. In many cases, those acts were first spontaneous or induced by some external event.Can you ""create tradition?""The most interesting part of this book to me was Rykwert's analysis of Celebration, Florida. This was, of course, Disney's effort to create a brand-new ""small town"" from the ground up. He correctly diagnoses the effort as being dominated by profitable real estate development. In fairness, he distinguishes Celebration from a typical suburban development because of its dependency on ""Olde World"" design principles.What he foresaw, almost inadvertantly, is the more widespread use of this modality for commercial/residential developments now springing up in revived, older suburban areas. These have been commercially successful and have created the sorts of delightful spaces he describes in his coverage of older urban spaces.It's a good book, albeit a little dogmatic."
2,Yuck by jordan,Give me a break. This is the worst joystick I have ever tried.The games have terrible graphics(I know there old and all) but still. Some of the games are all right such as food fight breakout and super breakout and centipede(millipede). But it all goes down to the joystick which is a load of you know what.Go with the sega arcade legends.
3,Dated but still somewhat relevant,"I lived in Japan for 2 years so I always enjoy other's stories about the trials of living there. Max Danger is an American business manager during the 80's. As such, I couldn't really relate to many of his adventures.He has the luxury of a secretary to handle all the tricky aspects of work. He has the American Club to socialize with other foreigners.He has a family, car, maid, american grocery stores etc.I had none of that. I'm not saying that I'm jealous. Just that Max Danger's experience has very little in common with my own.On top of that, the author's sense of humor is limited to giving people dull nicknames (Expat Max, Beautiful Gloria, Serious Hirose, etc.). There are a few gems that make good stories but those have strong hints of fiction to them.Those looking for a humorous take on an American's stumbles through Japan would do better with Dave Barry Does Japan."
5,Great watering tool!,"I have found this to be the bast watering gun I have ever used. It's not for sharp streams or blasting/pressure washing, but it is perfect for watering plants without splattering or making a mess. Great water control, too."
4,One of the better American Crew products,"I have straight, somewhat thin Asian hair, and American Crew Forming Creme is one of the better products I've used. Compared to other AC products I've tried (Fiber, Pomade and Texture Creme), Forming Creme has medium-strong hold (slightly less than Fiber, but stronger than Pomade or Texture Creme), and medium shine (more than Fiber, less than Pomade).The Forming Creme is a white, thick creme. Compared with Fiber, the closest product, it is easier to work with and apply. However, Forming Creme does not smell nearly as nice. It's important only to use a little at a time; otherwise it make hair look greasy and smell like the inside of a salon. When it dries it loses some hold but keeps hair natural looking.For short hair I'd prefer Fiber, but Forming Creme is a good option for longer hair with more shine."
3,decent book for the field trial trainer,this book focuses too much on field trials and not enough on the hunting dog..better books out there for the hunter
3,Not quite a bargin,"A good selection of tunes from a great movie. The cuts of Hazel Dickens singing Fire in the Hole and Hills of Galilee are fabulous. Unfortunately, the cd is not much of a bargin in terms of what you get. Out of the 21 cuts 9 are less a minute long and another 9 are between one and two minutes long, tending towards the shorter. Many are tunes and songs that are worthy of more extended renditions. Unlike many soundtracks this one seems true to the film: what you hear in the film is only what you get on the cd. So, a little disappointing."
1,Wrong idea,"This book is just too simplistic in its recipes for detecting the wrong man. Basically, it assumes that all women want to marry the same type of ""ideal"" man. Is this really the case? not very likely. Its pretty sad if you need a book like this to tell you who to date. Plenty of people who live with their heads in the clouds are going to go through life single, giving them plenty of time to read this."
5,We have all dated one of these men.,"This is a great book. Written well with a sense of humor and yet truthful.We have all dated someone in this book. The profiles are both factual,humorous and sad. It's good to know that these men exist and how to avoidbeing pulled in by them, let alone wasting your time.I lent it to two girlfriends who were reading it out loud and laughing whiledoing so. They both agreed they had made mistakes dating such men but nowbelieve they know better.This is a good read for women entering the dating pool who haven't been therefor some time or even for those knew to the arena. It just reminds us totrust our gut and do your homework. Be careful and work on yourself firstinstead of trying to change others. That way you won't be attracted to thesick and dysfunctional. Good luck."
4,"Beautiful book design, but what's inside?",Tales of the Jazz Age (Penguin Classics Hardcover) does not contain the original contents of the 1922 book of the same title. This edition contains the following eight stories.The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonHead and ShouldersThe Cut-Glass BowlThe Four FistsMay Day'O Russet Witch!'Bernice Bobs Her HairThe Lees of HappinessOf these stories five are also included in Flappers and Philosophers: The Collected Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald (Penguin Classics Hardcover). If you're buying these books as a book collector (like me) you'll want both titles because they are gorgeous editions. If however you're not intending on buying both I suggest purchasing Flappers and Philosophers instead as it has the majority of these stories plus many more.[...]
2,Total bunkum,"- Ghost Stories: Walking With the Dead (2007) **- Ghost Stories 2: Unmasking the Dead (2008) *- Ghost Stories 3: Conversations With the Dead (2009) *- Ghost Stories 4: Following the Dead (2011) **Maybe it's wrong of me to judge these so harshly after enjoying the first season of American Horror Story so much, but Ghost Stories are straight from the Museum of The Hard to Believe. Empty. Their EVP guy uses a microcassette recorder, and they show a handheld recorder with a TDK D cassette in it, as well. No wonder there are so many anomalies! It's funny because I'm sure they would argue that the cheap equipment is best for recording voices. Also, the ""Sixth Sense Boy"" who takes pictures of ""orbs""; You've got dust particles, genius. He has a tattoo of a Honda logo on his neck -- Not sure how seriously I can take him after a decision like that. Ghost Stories 4 gets an extra star solely because of the messed up picture of the murderer."
2,Pretty lame,"well theres 1 ol lady named Judy on the show that is obviously fake & over drama, an ol man that has 31 cats & I think most of the ppl on here have a mental disability, lol. But really, mostly its about afew places they check out, no1 has professional equiptment or know what their doing. Small investigations, mostly relying on the few that seem like their crazy to me. Its pretty boring. Not what I exspected & am very dissapointed. Gave it only 2 stars cuz I had nothing to watch anyways & it was there. Anticipated gettingthis dvd now that Ive seen it, wish I hadnt. Feels like I got ripped off. Anybody can get a camera & go around looking in the dark. The vision & sound on the dvd sucks. Seriously, take my advice, from a professional paranormal investigator, researcher & psychic, this dvd is a waste of time & money :("
4,Powred mixer loaded with features,"I ordered this powered mixer for our small church. It replaces a burned out Peavey. This Pyle sounds great and now gives us stereo. The USB capability works great and is very easy to use. We no longer have to make cds with one song on them, we can just use the USB feature. We don't use condenser mics, but the phantom power capability gives us the option, now. I gave it 4 stars because the fan is a bit louder than I would like. It doesn't seem to run hot at all so it seems to be overkill. All in all, it's great for us, I'd recommend it."
1,Not a good study resource -- save your money!,"Purchased this item for my college freshman daughter. The book is as described -- questions and answers, arranged like a multiple choice test. The problem is that the correct answer is marked and explained right with the question, and not in a separate section. The resource could not be used effectively as a practice test (since the correct answer is already marked) and is not comprehensive enough to be a good study outline."
3,Okay,"These pants are not particularly slim when worn by someone who is slim. The construction is inferior to Levis STF's, and they stretch out just as much. They haven't shrunk in the wash. Removal of the plastic patch is easy. They're fine enough for beaters. The rivets on the rear pockets are a nice detail. I would not wear these to impress anybody, but they beat other ill-fitting options."
2,These were not for me,These were very tight. You'd need to be of a very slim build in order to fit into these. I also didn't like the color (I realize it says indigo but it's difficult to tell from the pictures - when the arrive in person they're very indigo). I wear this size in several other types of jeans and it has worked out fine.
2,The wrinke jeans,"Most jeans are wash and wear, not these. I wear wranglers exclusvely but these will not be worn much as they MUST be ironed after wash and dry. So many deep set wrinkes and creases you have to steam iron before wearing. I won't order any more clothing online. I prefer to have a local merchant to accept my returns."
4,I ordered this as a gift,"I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend. I was very happy with the timely delivery. I will have to wait a few weeks to see if HE likes them, but I am confident he will. The denim seems to be of very high quality and I think these will last much better than other brands we have tried!"
5,Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Slim Fit Jeans,It has been hard to find jeans in a store that fit my son. He wears size 28x34. These jeans fit well and the price was reasonable.
4,Just what is needed,had a shock cap work its way loose (to much jumping most likely) so I lost a bit of damper oil. This is exactly what I needed to get my truck up and running the right way again.
3,Hot club track!!!,"Heard this one in the club, ordered the CD the next day...only after to realize that it was released on iTunes the next week.Track 1 is HOT HOT HOT, but the others didn't impress me at all. It's not Suze's fault though, she's got the goods to deliver, but her production people didn't cut the mustard this time...sorry."
1,A point on the previous review,"To quote the previous review...""A sophisticated, educated, and upper class Englishman visits his relatives in Germany and becomes aware of tensions between Bavaria and Munich and tensions between republicanism and monarchy. There is very little understanding between him and his relatives.""It is not surprising that the Englishman is little understood by his German relatives if he is talking about ""tensions between republicanism and monarchy"", since the German monarchy was overthrown in November 1918 in a popular revolution, many years before the date of this book.I hope this oversight doesn't reflect further historical errors with the novel."
4,David Clayton-Thomas gets down to basics,"Blood, Sweat & Tears frontman David Clatyon-Thomas' first solo release in 20 years takes a decidedly different turn. With ""Blue Plate Special"", DCT gets back to the music of his youth, his musical roots - straight ahead blues.On the opening cut, ""Too Many Dirty Dishes"", David shows right away how comfortable he is with this material. There are some other excellent covers as well, ""Hoochie Koochie Man"" and ""Hard Times"" Some of the best material, though is David's own rocker ""Wish the World Would Come To Memphis"" and ""Suzy Got Her Big Hair On"".Two cuts, ""Drown in My Own Tears"" and ""Lucretia MacEvil"", both have been recorded before by Clayton-Thomas and should have been left alone.Let me be clear on this, this is not a Blood, Sweat & Tears album. You won't find the rich horns on most cuts or the pop hooks. If you are looking for BS&T sound, then by BS&T's collection ""What Goes Up"". But for David Clayton-Thomas singing the blues, then this is the CD to get."
4,wrong item,recieved the wrong picture was not what was pictured in the ad. costumer service was excellent they was willing to refund me and or replace it with something else. very nice people to work with.
5,Excellent!,A wonderful intro to Wicca. It was not only very informative but interesting and fun to read. It didn't read like so many other dry Wiccan manuals. I really enjoyed the authors voice and style of writing.
4,It is a good read,I thought the book brought about clarity of Wicca to someone who would otherwise not know anything. It was a good start and I would recommend it.
1,really really really bad book,"From a new grad student's perspective, i have to say that this book is absolutely terrible!! The writers provided NO useful examples in the chapters and for the examples that are there, they never showed how they generated the results. Its pretty obvious that these guys are not interested in teaching and that very little thought was put into this book. I would recommend this book be banned from the classroom!"
2,A very old book,The book is much older and has more highlights and notes than I@expect what an old book should be. Should be at cheaper price.
3,It is great to have if you want to learn sign lan.,This movie did come out in the early 80's But I can remember watching it with my sisters and we learn to sign from it. I have recently found the movie and it all came back to me. THe shoe it self is heart warming and delightful. I feel that in a nutshell.. Its a movie about friends.. They come in all different shapes and sizes and it doesnt matter but you eill always have that special some one like toby had with k.c.
2,A little thin,"I was disappointed with this book. In an effort to keep the book from being too scientific, Ellison waters down the material too far for my comfort. Also, there are a lot of unanswered questions in this field of research. Time after time, Ellison poses an interesting question, and then is forced to answer her own question by saying, ""We don't know yet."" Then she moves on to idle speculation to fill in the blanks.Also, my copy of the book was missing pages 17-40, and had two copies of pages 41-64."
5,30 stories written from the 1980's through 2002,"Highly enjoyable and original collection, I was very happy this author was recommended reading in the book ""Dreams of the Woman Who Loved Sex"" by Tee Corinne.Also look for the erotic book ""Fragments from Lesbos"" (1981) published under the names Elana Nachman / Elana Dykewomon which contains a poem described by Ms. Corinne ""which settled into my memory with tenacity and exuberance"".This is a Keeper!"
5,Need To Know,Very useful and helpful product. Probably beats anything else out there.It does require some dedication and should be repeated at least once.
5,The Real Lee,"Blount helps us understand the real Lee for a change, not the ""marble man"" admired and revered by simple Civil War buffs. Those looking for yet another breathless account of the same old stories will be intellectually overmatched by the insightful, sensitive and illuminating portrait Blount presents. A real contribution to understanding Lee, the Civil War, and the mindset which led the nation to and through that disaster."
1,Disappointing study of a great general,"I found this book to be very disappointing. Significant parts of Lee's life are poorly covered. The author seems to want to psychoanalyze Lee. Inordinate time is spend on Lee's realtionship with his mother (mostly conjuncture) and the flaws in his personality.This book is a very poor treatment of a great and complex man.If you want an insight in to Lee, don't buy this book."
4,SHOW OFF PURPOSES ONLY!,i just got this sword and its well very well made for display purposes only....but if u want one that you can play around with...well i recomend spendin' a bit more $$$ and get the full tag battle ready version of this sword.....i would highly recomend this sword if your a final fantasy fan and need some display space to cover with because this sword will get the job done.
1,There's a better option,"This book was of high interest based on a family connection to the regiment.Great content, but this soft cover edition is not a high quality reproduction. Pages seem copied by xerox, don't even fill the page, fuzzy print and pictures, and bleed through on to the back of some pages. Throughout the book there are blank pages. (They do warn about some of that at the front of the book).I was disappointed in the quality, and then out of the blue found a used hardcover version. The print is larger, pictures are much clearer, and the blank pages of the other one are actually many more pictures and drawings in the hardcover, including colored photos of unit members on the jacket.Get the hardvover version."
1,Waste of time,"I can't believe this film get so many positive reviews. For me it wasjust a boring experience.To begin with, the movie develops WAY too slow. Long pauses withnothing going on are quite often.The boy's character (Sean) is just crazy. And not in a good way. Ifyou watch a comedy, you can feel sympathy for crazy characters. Butwhen you watch a film targeting so called ""sophisticated audience"" youwant characters to make a bit more sense.Ten years after Anna's husband's death the boy comes along claimingthat he is the husband, Sean. Acting rather weirdly, and not makingany effort to convince anyone that he actually is Sean. If he reallywere Sean and loved Anna as much as he claimed he should've stayedaway from her. It's been ten years for her, after all. And he is afreaking boy who (apparently) spent 10 years in a freezer.Unfortunately this point was not voiced by any of the characters,which again raises question about their intellectual abilities."
1,Birth - ??,"what a dumb movie Birth was. it should be renamed ""afterbirth"" as in placenta. yuck....stupid with no ending. the story line was obviously too much for the writer to handle. what a waste of a deeper subject."
2,Please,This was an story about a 10 year old boy who believes he is the dead husband of an adult woman. I was afraid I was going to need to call child protection services sometime during the movie. Bad story line. Bad idea. Bad film. Please leave the kids out of this kind of nonsense. Jackie
3,I liked it... for the most part.,"This movie is not your typical polished mystery with a firm conclusion. This movie meanders and makes you question what is going on. Is this child for real or is he playing a game? If he is playing a game... why?The plot has been gone over many times here so I will not do that. However, the cinematography, costumes, sets, backgrounds, music and acting are all top notch. There's just this perplexing story line that you are compelled to follow.I do believe it's worth watching... maybe more than once. I wouldn't own it though. It is provocative enough, but not that much.If you have time to spare and are in the mood for more than 'in you face' entertainment this sleeper will foot the bill nicely. If you want anything else then look elsewhere."
2,"Promises fire, delivers smoke...","After a great, gorgeous set-up, this film about tremulous emotions, human fragility and tricks of the mind settles down into an all-too literal and mundane drama. Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to ""spell it all out"" in the script, instead of weaving the viewer into a more subtle human mystery. Nicole Kidman is lit, made up, and photographed like a goddess--but she does more for the character and for the movie than they do for her. Although beautiful, she's sort of playing it dazed here, a smart but tepid woman with a vacuousness about her that doesn't allow for inner fire. I wanted to her to yell and shake the strange boy who enters her life. Instead she tucks him in..."
4,Pretty good but Pointless...,This movie is good. There is a fairly good plot but some parts aer just stupid. The end makes you think Why was this movie even made? It seems pointless.
3,I think I felt him kick....,"Jeez, the lengths some of us menfolk (even, apparently, those of us who are, um, 10 years old or so) will go to get into a bathtub with Nicole Kidman, eh? This odd, underwritten movie somehow manages to be both challenging and vaccant at the same time -- think Alfred Hitchcock directing an episode of ""Desperate Housewives"" and you'll be in the ballpark. I gotta go boil some water or something...."
2,is he about to...nope just dissapointment,"When this movie first came out, it seemed interesting enough to buy on DVD. its a good thing i didnt. i watched this movie on the Encore and in the begining it was fine. the story and the acting is pretty good too. why did i give it 2 stars? because i was so disspaointed and felt that i had wasted my time once the movie was over. THERE IS NO CLOSURE. none! no ending. i could not believe what the director had done. just when you think youre into the movie, it makes you hate the entire thing. at a different time i might have given this movie 3 stars, but i just finished watching it and as you can tell, im still on that stage of dissapointment. in my opinion, its not worth any amount of money on DVD. its not a movie that you can or would want to watch twice. rent it at blockbuster if youre really curious about how the story plays out."
3,the pic dosnt match what i got,they are fitted to the car but for 111 dollors you would think they would have the factory holes so that they will stay in place... nope.. so as far as fitment goes they are cut to fit my car but they do not go all the way down bc those plugs hit it..
1,Heron Scarer did not work,Very simply the Heron is still fishing my pond clean of hundreds of dollars worth of fish.
1,THE LEG NOT INCLUDED,"I bought two of these, plastic Herons and they DO NOT INCLUDE THE LEG PICTURED now I have no use for a nesting heron and I will have to return these two Heron Decoys to get ones that can stand on their own two legs."
5,"Item as described, worked great!","This was a brand new OEM part, in the box. Worked great. Awesome price, saved almost 50% from other vendors."
5,calphalon contemporary nonstick 8 and 10 inch combo pack,"I used them everyday,excellent valuewell built,perform well and lasting,a must have for small to med size kitchens,make wonderful gifts too."
5,These are great!,"I am no snob, but these pans are seriously wonderful! (I use them both all the time). For instance: to fry an egg or omlette, I never imagined not using any butter or olive oil/cooking spray. I never use anything unless I sautee something, and even then it takes so much less butter or oil. It's weird. And they heat surprisingly evenly. They're a breeze to clean, too. After I got these as a gift a few months ago, I've bought a couple other pots/pans from the contemporary nonstick collection. You won't be disappointed, especially at this price. Zero effort. . . just my style."
2,Poor DVD,"If you have a basic understanding of a shuffle type drum feel, save your money and don't buy this DVD. The whole DVD is a collection of Mr. Layton stumbling over himself trying to get words out of his mouth in attempts to make a point. Very boring. He says nothing of fills, grip, drumming in different styles, rudiments, or actually playing the drumset! He demonstrates the same basic shuffle 50 times. Thats all the DVD is. Sound quality is indeed poor. Mr. Layton is a great player, but a pretty bad teacher. This DVD gets 2 out of 5 stars at best."
3,You'll need a casserole dish...,"This book is good for basic pressure cooker info and recipes. There is a good bean cooking reference. However, some of the tastier recipes require you to place a casserole dish inside your pressure cooker. This doesn't work in my case (5 qt pressure cooker)."
3,OK book,OK but not up with the better items on the market...I have 8 pressure cooker books....this is one that would rank last of the better items I have....
1,my poor baby!!!,"Bought this for my 2 year old to keep his skin moisturised in these winter months, big mistake. Applied it to his skin after his night time bath and within 24-36 hours a pimply red rash started to appear. now, 3-4 days later the rash has spread and has got much worse. He has had at least 3 baths since i applied it and the rash is still very much there. Wish i had been wise enough to read some reviews on the product beforehand, but having used Johnsons products on my babys skin since birth, i felt absolutely safe to use this. I would not recommend this product, especially not for babies/children."
2,Well's Most Obscure,"In what is perhaps Wells' most obscure book, this is less sci-fi than it is his socialistic vision for the world where everyone is happy and equal and the capitalist system collapses. Of course, he would live through two world wars and see socialism rear its ugly head. Perhaps at the end he might have written a different book. Also, he disdains religion and his ideas on relationships fit into the '60s more than the early 1900s. Today, none of this would be shocking. His prediction of war between England and Germany would soon come true. His dislike of war is perhaps the only high point of this book. Controversal book then, but not so much now. Not as timeless has his others, but at the very least will let you see into the mind of this famous writer."
3,"Nice backpack, but smaller than I expected.","This is a very nice backpack and very well made, but I expected it to be a little bigger. This backpack is only slightly larger than a child's backpack."
1,What a letdown!,"I was anticipating so much the arrival of the DVDs and especially so after paying a bomb for it. When it arrived, I tore open the packaging and immediately started viewing. 1st espisode and I was telling myself ""Ok, why don't I watch another espidoe?"". By the second espisode I was ready to give up. The plot is so lame and the characters are so shallow! The special effects are soooooo bad! Personally, I think this DVD is overpriced! :-("
3,*sci* fimantic.,"Take a dash of Tom Cruise and teaspon of Mark Harmon and you get Dr. Jack Harkness.What starts off as a promising premise quickly turns into a an acting troupe governed but a zealous minion of Xenu. I hated the ""upgrade"" cyborg episode for its shoddy acting alone, but then felt even more shafted when Tash's character had her ""emotional"" character intro episode. Solutions seem all too easy for the Torchwood gang and their dirty little romps leave much to be desired. [...]"
2,Not Good,the english in the entire series sucks... so stupid british accent...Series could have decent crowds if the medium is changed....lunatics
3,hard to suspend my disbelief,"My problem with Torchwood is that its team members, as a group of persons who should have been carefully selected to be 'above the law, outside the government' are completely unbelievable. In fact, the show is almost entirely dedicated to exploring the group members' misuse and abuse of their positions. And in so doing, it is quite compelling. The 'They keep killing Suzie' explores just how deeply a team member abused her position; it may be the best episode of the season. The episodes that don't focus on team misbehavior, e.g., the 'aliens need sex' and 'countrycide' episodes, are among the weakest. The characters of Torchwood make the characters of Primeval look like hard core professionals in comparison."
4,I actually liked it...,"I actually liked the episode. I didn't think the acting was bad, I thought exactly the opposite. The actor who played Ianto, I thought, convinced me of his love for the cyberwoman (although half the episode I was thinking and shouting about how stupid he was...but then again love does make people do stupid things). I liked how Jack was taking charge and forcing everyone to make hard choices. He understands way more than everyone else, especially traveling with the Doctor (that is involved...right?) so i thought John Barrowman's acting was good, as well. This episode was the best so far. At parts it made me sad, angry, and nausiated (especially when Ianto hugged the pizza girl with Lisa's brain...that was really creepy).I don't really understand the other reviews...I actually liked this episode."
3,no Dr Who that's for sure,TorchwoodThis series is no where near as good as Doctor Who despite being a spin off of the show.They seem too comitted to finding any excuse to drop in as many meaningless sex scenes as possible and neglect to pay attention to the failing plot line.Every charcter has a ridiculous bisexual scene by the end of the first series and CGI is left wanting in the final episode.It is a shame as there is so much potential for excellence in this series.
2,"Lots of British Slang, painful to listen to and watch","Not sure what they are saying half the time, the other is sort of pretty cheesy sci-fi. Acting is subpar as well. 2 stars."
1,Terrible,"Looking for some mindless science fiction fun to watch in the evening. This episode (series?) was not it. Anyway, at least I got it free with my Prime account. Terrible implausible plot. I have a hard time understanding this but the ""butler"", don't remember his name, was responsible for the murder of two people-an innocent woman too! and threatened to kill the team but Jack Harkness and crew had no trouble forgiving him and welcoming him back. The plot is a rehash of the Borg from Star Trek, but the writers made a fundamental mistake, there was no internal struggle for her to be good, even though she wasn't completely upgraded. Instead she was just evil, so no sympathy for her so what a waste of time, should have watched Stargate instead."
5,One of the Best Series in a Long TIme,You have to see this if you are a new Dr. who fan or not. Its just plain great stuff for everyone to watch.
3,"Love the series, not so much this episode.","I have just recently discovered Torchwood, and am loving the series! However, this particular episode is kind of a snoozer. I'm having a hard time caring what happens to Eugene. I'm hanging with it, because (like Doctor Who), you can miss a large meaning in a small detail. But I *almost* want to fast-forward this one."
2,Nice try...,"Sorry, but I gave this five episodes to get better and I just can't get past the bad acting and horrible dialog.It's too bad too because the premise of the show is interesting albeit not too original."
4,Not as bad as all that.,"This episode presents real characters faced with daunting moral dilemmas in situations without any real positive solutions. It lays the groundwork for Captain Jack as a military man as well as the rogue he's been made out to be thus far and forces all of the team members to make hard choices. I also think that given these difficult choices and the characters conflicting motivations, the acting isn't bad. The cast members don't play the extreme melodramatic parts that this episode could have devolved toward, and they really seem to struggle to come to their decisions and to stick with them. There are a couple instances where the actions taken are a little too convenient to the plot line, but I think it showcases the characters in a way that the episodes before this one do not."
1,GOOD IDEA BROUGHT DOWN BY IMMORAL CHARACTERS,"I watched this show primarily because it was made by the producers of Doctor Who. The show starts off with a good concept and some very intriguing story lines. However, after half-way through the season it appears that all of the characters are nothing but shallow sex-craved individuals with little moral character. The stories appear to be just written around an excuse to get the characters into compromising positions. If this series was a typical prime-time drama that would be expected but since it is supposed to be a science fiction series I would expect a little more of a plot. In the end I found myself fast-forwarding through the episodes just to get to the end and see how things turned out. I will not even bother watching Season 2."
1,anyone have a pistol?,"This book was utterly WRETCHED! I can normally read a book in 2-3 days, and it took me three weeks to finish it. Hawthorne is ridiculously long winded and shows no reaction from the characters in the book. They mine as well be trees. If you ever have an interest in reading this book, have yourself committed before it's too late"
5,review,"This game is from a different generation of games, and in my opinion, better than most out today. The graphics are simple but good, and its can be more challenging than some of todays games."
2,Professionals only.,This is not what i expected. I needed a beginners guide. The book tells little about cameras. It's mostly how to do professional shoots...meaning expensive specialized equipment.
4,The perfect set,I purchased this set because I wanted to see if a stackable set of right would nice with my engagement ring as I am getting married in March. I have since been wearing the rings and have gotten so many compliments on them! Worth the price and shine just as a real diamond does!
4,versatile but...,"The rings are pretty but as a few other people mentioned, not the most comfortable. I like the fact that you can wear one or all three, the only problem while wearing all three is there's gaps between the rings (they don't stack tightly) and seem to come apart. For this reason I prefer to wear one on my thumb, looks cool and keeps the ring from rubbing on the other fingers. I cannot imagine wearing these on a middle finger, ouch. They are well made (hence the 4 stars) and hopefully the little CZ's won't fall out as they have done in other rings I've purchased elsewhere and had to return."
2,Uncomfortable,"This ring might be ok for someone with long fingers.its a very large looking ring for someonr with shorter fingers.i could not put my fingers together.the size runs a bit large also.does not look real,but I can see it being ok as a fun ring.this was not for me I have the wrong type of fingers for it."
4,Sparkle and stackable,"I like the sparkle of this set, which can be worn as a single ring, two, or all three. I typically like slightly larger rings, but this is OK. I think I was hoping the bands were a little wider, but this works with certain outfits."
2,Adds very little that the interface doesn't already have,"This is the very simple introduction that used to be included free with an operating system, only now it lists for (...) Absolutely useless for troubleshooting. It's full of information like, ""To cancel a wizard, click the cancel button"""
2,STOP DON'T BUY THIS,I just got this figure today and when I took it out of the package the arm BROKE OFF!!!!! It was $44.95 and I couldn't believe that it fell apart so easily. Do not buy this figure because it is a rip off!!!!!!
1,Not from NBC,This figurine is actually a character fir the movie James and the Giant Peach not from The Nightmare Before Christmas at all.
2,Small Feet Only,Adult one size fits all - not over a shoe size of 10. I wear a 12 and these do not fit at all. I can manage to get them on but there is at least an inch of my shoe showing at the toe. The overall look and feel is decent.
4,This is what haven must sounds like,"This is the next best thing to being there, on a Caribbean hide-away. Digitally recorded on an tiny inlet of a small island just off the British Virgin Island. This is best natural sound CD recording so far that I had ever listened. You could hear the crystal blue ocean ebbs and flows in and around you, far away, the faint roar of the surf on the coral reef added to the atmosphere of the surroundings. Occasionally, a hummingbird flew by the microphones, and goats could be heard on their mid-day walk on the beach. I can almost smell the salt air of the sea. A truly haven sent on a sleepless night."
5,Windows XP Bible,Great help for most problems. I use it all the time. Easy to understand.Put it on your to buy list. 5 stars!!
5,Dancing in the Aisle-Spiritual Lessons Learned from Children,"This is an excellent book with lovely images and thoughtful prose. Brimming with stories from the mouths of children, the book is inspiring and touching, and gently nudges us where we most need it. It would make a wonderful gift."
3,Get the other one instead,"No reason to purchase this DVD. Just grab the ""Superstars of KOTC"" instead as it includes this DVD and the ""Fighters of Japan"" DVD in one package for the same basic price"
1,I'm absolutely DISGUSTED!,"I ordered 2 of these sheets from this website and was initally disappointed in teh color, but I suppose that's a risk of on-line shopping. It simply wasn't the shade I expected, but that can be overlooked. What really DISGUSTED me, was that BOTH sheets, although packaged sperately had dead bugs in them when I opened the package. I am appalled that Carters, supposedly a good brand would have such a thing happen. There is no sign of the sheets having been previously opened, and the bugs (yes, more than one in each) were smashed in between layers, on the inside of the sheets, so I can only guess they were folded and packaged with the bugs on them. Where were these sheets packaged? A barn? If two seperate sets both had bugs, what other things that we never see might end up in our children's bedding..."
5,Best Celtic Bluegrass Band,"The Paperboys are the best band to hit the scene in a long time. I've been looking for recent Celtic music as I wanted to learn more about my anscestory and The Paperboys are one of the best if not the best Celtic bands of the present. The first time I ever heard them was at a live concert at Seattle University and have been an avid fan ever since. The creativity and commaradery is both seen and sensed. The band has fun doing what they are doing. And when the band is having fun you can't help but have fun. Take a chance, you will not be disappointed."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I purchased this book, hoping it would be more of a reference guide on using essential oils in recipe blending of my own. I made the decision to purchase this book over another I was considering, based on some of the reviews I had read on both. However, it is basically exactly what the title indicates-a recipe book. While it has some interesting recipes I may try, it isn't quite what I was looking for. The book seems okay for what it is, though I have not tried any of the blends. If you are looking for recipes, which are not the same old, everyone uses, then you may like this book."
3,"Holds the pads down, but doesnt stop shredding","This product definitely works as a method to hold down the puppy pads. No more will you find the puppy pad being dragged all over the house. It's very easy to put together and use. I would recommend wearing rubber gloves when changing the pads though cause sometimes this can be a rather messy process. The only thing I don't like is that one of my dogs and our pups in general when we have them can still manage to shred the pad. Sure the holder holds down all the edges just perfect but it can't stop the shredders. I don't think this is any fault of the holder however. If your trying to avoid the shredding I don't think there is anything on the market for it. I've been looking though, but for now I like this product. It's neat and easy to use and holds the pad in place for the most part."
5,Unbearably Beautiful,"This is a wonderful little book, a best-seller and heart-wrenching tear-jerker in the best sense (and there is a good sense of those terms). A girl's fiance' is reported dead in World War One, but she has reason to doubt the report. She tracks down leads for years, with the sort of perseverance only such a motivation brings. In the process she encounters help and hindrance, lies and truth, wisdom and incompetence, enough so that those who detest suspense can value this book while pretending to ignore it.Only after more than half of the story has been told are we given a glimpse of our heroine's pre-war happiness. The scene could stand alone, but is unbearably beautiful when read in its place."
4,A Very Long Engagement,This was a good story although a lot of characters to keep up with. The author did a good job tying the characters together at the end. I wondered if he intentionally made the story line scattered and inconsistent as that is how communication was in that time period. I would recommend it if someone likes to read about history.
3,"A good story, but difficult to follow","The storyline in this book is great and the author certainly does a good job educating the reader in the psychological horrors of war. However, the story is often difficult to follow with lots of new names appearing throughout that are hard to keep track of. It is by no means a ""fast read"", but if your willing to really concentrate and wade through it, its a pretty good one."
1,Creative same as Alienware,I order online from there company. They send me broken box. I want to return but they say if you return they will charge you for the money.I pay for 500 dollars for this? then i go home i use that speaker .the website say it can connect to muvo mp3 player. I try but it not work.They send me problem speaker!!!
5,This book helped me get a 5 on the test!,"This book was so helpful to me last year! Not only did it help me get an ""A"" in my Ap European class, but it helped me get a 5 on the AP European test! I suggest buying this book ahead of time and reading a little bit each day, like before you go to sleep, if you have extra time, etc. This book was essential to my success with AP European."
3,"Good overall, but too general","This is a good review book without a doubt. I studied heavily from it and earned a 5 on the AP Exam. I'm pretty sure this wasn't a coincidence. The historical review is broad and quick...good if you know your facts and want to review, but bad if you need to do some last-minute learning. Besides the rather brief coverage of historical facts, my other major problem with this book is the sample test. The test in the back asks a number of trivial questions, all of whose answers can be found as some of the only specifics within the review section: a bit silly in my opinion. This is a good review book, but it is by no means comprehensive enough to stand alone in your studies."
4,useful little device,"This is my second time buying this remote, first time at Amazon. It is basically the same device but they changed the duration of the signal and the code keys are in reverse order. It functions better than the previous version. Overall happy with the performance. But if you are looking to have a long range remote, this is not the one you should go for."
1,"Yawn, Boo, Dribble","With the money I wasted on this book, I could have seen a couple of movies (even the trashiest couldn't be less informative than this book). With the time I wasted reading this book, I could have been doing ANYTHING, including using my brain to THINK about REAL POSSIBILITIES of ending women's oppression & my role in it instead of making Ms. Young rich for extoling the virtues of the status quo. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
5,A fair and constructive book on gender issue.,"A fair, balanced, and constructive book on gender issue. It clears many mythes due to radical feminist, comments on men's movement fairly, and proposes a way to true equality (no one has privileges). The author spends most contents to criticize or comment existing thoughts and movements and less on its proposals. Technically, it is a well written and easy to read book."
1,doo-doo,"I bought this book & Germaine Greer's ""The Whole Woman"" at the same time & read them back to back. The experience was like reading Einstein & then being forced to sit in a room & listen to Archie Bunker. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy TWO copies of Greer's book, & give one to a friend. Spare yourself Young's doo-doo."
5,Terrific Book!,"Definitely the best book I've read about contemporary gender issues. Cathy Young writes incisively and clearly, while also backing up nearly everything she says. Blessedly free of the polemic that marks so many other gender-related books. This is a very balanced and insightful view into the state of gender issues in modern-day America. A must read!"
5,Much needed balance! Excellent book!,"If your looking for a balanced treatment of the current gender unpleasantness this book is a good place to start. If your looking for another book about ""woman hating"" like the Doctor in San Francisco spare yourself the cognitive dissonance. I'm not saying that this book is The Truth but it shows that there are both sides to this. If your truth seeking, then read this book! To present the rising 'misandrny' that exists in our society, as Ms. Young does authoritatively, does not diminish concerns over abuses of women. Ms. Young does deal with both sides--if there is something of an emphasis toward the male side it is because it has been so little presented. There are plenty, plenty of books on misogyny. Pleeeeez."
4,Dancing With the Witch Doctor,"An intersting and revealing account of medical training and practice in the mid 1950s. If you want to known what the oldtime rural doctor was like read this account. Filled with heartwarming and intersting accounts of medical practices in the past, and comments on medical practice today. The author develops the feelings and relationshipe between doctor and patient. Not a mistery or thriller, but pleasant reading and rewarding."
5,Rabbit- Animal Alley,"I got this Animal Alley toy recently for my birthday. I bought the black one. It is very cuddly and soft. I reccomend any age would love it. As with all Animal Alley toys, you can use your imagination and have a new best friend. I hope you enjoy it, I know I do!~TRUK"
2,review,"Okay quality at best--- same content as power of positive thinking , but older content---less up to date."
1,This book is far too boring.,"Edith Wharton is a wonderful author, but this is definitely NOT one of her better works. The story is not of her norm, and in my opinion she should have stayed with her standard story. The characters are not realistic: Mattie is perfect for Ethan, and Zeena is too overbearing and just plain evil. This book, although short, seems too long once you start reading it. Don't bother with this book."
3,Good Start,"This book is OK as a intro into the business. It provides a guideline of all of the requirements to get started, but is only an outline. There are few ""Nuts and Bolts"" type of information within the book. One example is when you are told to ""secure financing"", all good and well, but HOW? After using this book to see if you really wanted to go down this path, I would suggest Alonzo's book. Much more in depth."
3,disappointment at the saga's finale,"I looked forward to Band of Brothers, preordering the book. However, I found that the book seemed rushed, as if the author, like our central character and his Republic, were tired of the long war. There were occasional moments when the author's skill resurfaced to enthrall one, but overall the book was a big disappointment, not worthy of the rest of the series."
1,Not much information,"The first 72 pages of this book are a history of the Papacy which I didn't need to read. The last 20 pages of the book, Cahill spends bashing Pope John Paul II's Papacy! There is some good information in the middle. Obviously Cahill is a liberal Catholicand unhappy at the Orthodox position that the John Paul II Pontificate has taken and which was needed for the Catholic Church. I do not think that John XXIII 's vision was what the Church became after Vatican II."
3,Way Overpriced,"This is a tiny book, with only a couple of good ideas for fragrance combinations and an idea for a dish soap cake in what looks like something you'd make a baked apple in that I liked. Not worth the price of the book.I also was not happy to see that many of the recipes featured sodium laurel sulfate, which is a common allergen (it is in most shampoos, for instance). It is in fact in so many things that people often don't know that it is the culprit when their skin itches.There are better books out there: Clean House, Clean Planet; and Better Basics for the Home, if you are interested in nontoxic cleaning, and neither of them call for Sodium Laurel Sulfate for any of their recipes."
3,Gun Shots,"Bambi is an okay book. Bambi is a deer that has a friend called Hair.He was interested in the plain outside the woods.His mother took him out but told him to be careful. So Bambi went out and heard GUN SHOTS. When all the animals ran in, Bambi's mother was gone!!""He"" had come to the woods. More humans had come to the woods. They had died. Bambi lived with someone else."
4,What did I just read?,"Those of you who pick up Bambi expecting a disney-like story will be very surprised. Instead of a fairy tale land of flowers and butterflies, you find a much harsher setting where survival of the fittest is often a humbling reality. The sad hardships of Bambi and friends really strike home.I enjoyed this book mostly because it made me think, and although it was depressing, a book that evokes no emotion in the reader is not my idea of a great book."
1,"why the book, why now?","a. have spent enough ""quarlity time with the family"", done ""being there with the teenager son"";b. ""Genious"" boss is in deep trouble now, time for Super Spin Mater to save his ass again;c. realizing her access to the White House will expire by the end of year, time to make more money off this guy - people less likely to pay for a fan book about a guy after he lost the office - better do it quick!e. last chance to show off her spin skill in a style of a crossover between a religious fanatic and an used car dealerd. all of the above"
2,Normal? Maybe. Painful? Definitely.,"Whoa. Karen Hughes has her own meaning of Normal and she comes off as a happy, well-adjusted woman. Good for her. I liked her honesty in telling her story and feel the writing isn't bad. It's not good--but it's not bad. One expects more from such a self-proclaimed successful former journalist and contributing speech writer for a god.In terms of a good read? Don't waste your time. This book has a single dimension: Unfailing praise for ""her boss,"" George W. Bush. She's like a groupie--or like Courtney Cox when she got pulled on stage during a Bruce Springsteen concert--thrust into the limelight and wondering how it all happened to her.It is among the most boring and self-aggrandizing memoirs I've ever read. Glad I only borrowed it from a friend. My apologies to the author. I wanted to like it."
3,Implosion,"More evidence of the disaster of the GW Bush presidency. Karen Hughes is not a really good writer and not really very forthcoming. She is a good shill for dead politcal slogans. More evidence that Texas is an evil place, Texas is more of a threat to America than Bin Laden. GW Bush has failed in every aspect of business and diplomacy. You wouldn't know this from reading Hughes' hagiography. I will never voted again for someone from the south or who has a southern accent. They all seem fake. They all seem like con men. I start thinking who is getting ripped off."
5,Best bio since Lazy B by Sandy O'Connor,"This is so warm and witty, I wish I had written it. I also wish I had read it. I can not tell a lie, I have only read about 1/4 of this book while standing at Barnes and Noble. But that quarter was enough to make me fall in love with Karen and her book.I also saw her on TV recently and she is just as charming in person as she is in the book. I have been to Normal, IL, and could just see the trainman saying: ""Ten minutes to Normal"".Her intimacy with the president and her closeness to power is probably more genuine than any similar person, and come to think of it, even Condy Rice and Madeline Allbright lack what I will call her ""Luminosity"". For some reason, I compare Karen to the 19th Centruy writer E.D.E.N. Southworth in her writing style?I will be back when I have truly read the other 3/4 of the book."
2,Profiteering on insider information,"I am troubled that someone would sell a book, trading on their service as a government insider with access to our nation's most valuable intelligence."
1,Makes P.R. Folks look bad...,"It's really a shame that Ms. Hughes did not offer more insight into ""her boss"" and the inner workings of her political world. Instead, the book is primarily p.r. spin. While that was her job when working for Bush...one would think she would take a more in depth look once she left the White House. But, she could not get past her P.R. role...here is one p.r. person who really did believe her own press releases. A sad disappointment."
1,What a piece of junk,"I got this from my sister, and just finished it. It is one of the worst politcal books I have ever read. As a republican, I am totally disgusted by these people who are supposed to be representing my party and my country. This whole thing is all about ""the message"" instead of improving the state of the country.In a word, it is junk. Whatever happened to real leaders like Reagan?"
1,Over Achiever At the Top,"Remember the over-achiever in school who asked a lot of dumb questions but thought she was so profound? Well she is here. What's scary is that she is working for the Pres. advising him on what to say and do so he can appeal to the rest of us. Issues don't matter and cricism is baseless. The President and his annointed adviser are on the side of right by dint of their pure hearts, God knows. This is scary stuff. Is the President so insecure that he needs a cheerleader like this at his side? Would he have stopped reading My Pet Goat if Karen had only gone with him on that trip to Fla. It's not what you know that gets you to the top; vapid and selfrightous spin does."
3,Cult Classics Halloween Evolution of Evil 2-PackCult Classics Halloween Evolution of Evil 2-Pack,If your a Horror figure collector than this set is a must have. Only problem is when you take them out of the box. Younger Michael's arms fell right off as soon as i tried pulling him out of the package!! Very cheaply made. Im a huge NECA fan and this is just wrong for a figure to fall apart when you open the box.
4,2nd book of the Series,"Chloe finds herself in a bathroom with a sexy stranger.... When she finds out who the sexy stranger is then the real danger starts. The Sexy Series of three friends who works at the KTEX TV station in Texas are all fun romance novels. Check them all outSuddenly Sexy (Sexy Trilogy)(1),Sinfully Sexy (Sexy Trilogy)(2) andSimply Sexy (Sexy Trilogy)(3rd and my favorite)."
2,Rather frustrating,It is difficult to understand quite a bit these CDs. The native speakers speak so quickly - which is fine if adequate written help is available. It isn't. I have to have Spanish speaking friends listen for me and then repeat the words slowly or write them or else I am lost.
2,Old news.,"It's interesting how Anspach presents all this information on Monopoly's origins as groundbreaking investigation when I read most of it in Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games (published in 1969) and in Phil Orbane's The Monopoly Book (authorized by Parker Brothers, no less). Anspach must have been really out of touch not to have known all of this - which doesn't surprise me at all."
4,Good Textbook,I really enjoyed this textbook. It is organized well and talks like a conversation. It is easy to read and the author provides lots of examples of the concepts she describes. One thing I did not like about the book is the authors gender bias for certain situations and concepts. Other than that it was a good textbook.
1,TERRIBLE I TEM... DO NOT BUY,"This item, along with it's radio designed for it, is singlhandedly the worst item I ever bought from Amazon. It worked for only an hour, and litterally blew up."
2,this film lacks the oxygen to make it a really good thriller,"This film has an intense premise and the thriller aspects of it should have a high pace, but the psychological torments just don't add up. Adrien Brody is superb and creepy as the Houdini killer. At times the film feels made-for-TV rather than a true portrayal of the horror of this drama. Henry (played by Brody) asks the female detective (played by Maura Tierney) is she knows what's it's like being clever. That seems to be the problem with this film - it tries to be clever rather than to follow the logistical progression of its own storyline."
1,"Don't suffer this ""movie""","No pausible plot, bad dialogue, cheap scenario, no depth of police/FBI procedure, pathetic use of psychology and so full of holes (E.g When trying to trace the kidnapper's stolen car while in pursuit, the police reply ""no fingerprints, no witnesses"". Like where would a thief leave fingerprints at the place the car was stolen!"" The best part of this movie save for perhaps the music is wathcing the word OXYGEN appear at the end."
5,Magic Eyes Standing Mirror is a Hit,"I love this product! It's perfect for any facial work; makeup, tweezing, etc.Magic Focus big eyes mirror -BE202 Standing Vanity 4"""
5,Under the Black Flag,"Under the Black Flag entertained me. I really enjoyed reading this book. I was 17 when I read it. This was before Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean came out. After seeing the movie, I had to laugh because Disney did keep the real story behind a pirates life as G rated as possible. I recommend this to anyone who loves non-fiction books about pirates."
3,"Agree with ""ol' Sterny"" on this one","Have to agree with Stern's comments about the sloppy nature and confused mission of this book, although my gripe is more with regard to the fundamental flow of this book. This thing runs you back and forth and all over the place, visiting and revisiting subjects and characters to the point where the Cordingly's attention deficit disorder becomes incredibly annoying. Once again, I agree with Stern's review: the book is well worth reading, but only as a compilation of miscellaneous facts about famous names and events. A fun thing to do if you're going to the beach for the weekend, or if you plan to attend your wife's high school reunion and you fear you'll have nothing to talk about."
5,A WOW BIOGRAPHY!,"This Book is a very good book! I checked out lots of books of the library and this book is a VERY GOOD MOZART BOOK! I personally will buy this when I can.. I have it in my Wishlist. (I don't have enough money to buy it now).. So I rate this book ***** (5) Stars! IF YOU WANT YOU CAN BUY IT FOR ME, IT IS NO PROBLEM."
2,Good scans but defective CCD,"The unit I received appeared to have a defective CCD imaging system. The scan quality was pretty good, but every scan had 2 vertical red lines that went from top to bottom. Couldn't get rid of it no matter what I tried. Unfortunately, have to return to Amazon. Will probably try a different Epson model scanner next time around."
2,Okay for a CHEAP scanner,"Epson was clearly going for features over quality with this scanner. You don't need to get out a ruler to notice that the images produced are distored. Vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines are all wobbly. On my unit the right inch of the image is noticeably darker than the rest of the image. Colors are inconsistent to, with the center being bluer and the sides begin greener.Yes, this is only $100, so I wasn't expecting ""Perfection"", but I was expecting distortions and problems to be limited to things I'd have to measure or see only under magnification. With this scanner, just scanning an invoice shows up the problems without even trying to look for them.The packaged OCR software worked great the one time I tried it and I could see using this scanner for OCR and in place of a Fax scanner, but if you care about image quality at all, this is not the scanner for you."
1,HORRIBLE!! Horrible! horrible......,"It's been many years since I've worked with such an unreliable peice of hardware. Of the 10 times I've tried to use it, it has only functioned properly once. Changing cables, restarting scanner, restaring computer, re-installing software.... nothing. When you really need it to work and it consistently fails leaves you're left feeling very frustrated. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money to get a scanner that will be reliable. This scanner isn't."
4,Great Book,I read this book in one sitting. This book is a great book about what God can do in our lives and how he really does meet our needs. Great book.
5,Works well,"I've had this replace my old analog Honeywell thermostat and been working great since December 2012. Installation was a breeze, just screw the wires in the correct receptacles and you're set. I've never used the programmable features but friends tell me it can be a pain to configure. Not needed though, all I care about is the temp up/down, on/off and the hold buttons :)"
2,Not very efficient,"It's a decent thermostat if you like to maintain a constant temperature, but you cannot program a temperature swing. That means your air conditioner and furnace are cycling on and off very often to maintain a one degree zone.The biggest strain on the air conditioner is the compressor starting, and this also is less economical because it takes more power to start. Do you notice your lights dim a little when the air kicks on, well these Honeywells cause it to kick on and off way too much.Also if you have an electronic or glow plug type ignition for your Furnace it's the same thing. This all adds up to increased electric use and premature failure of some equipment.I would prefer to let the temperature of my home vary a couple of degrees then have all that on and off cycling. It seems like excessive and unneeded wear and tear on the components to meThis applies to all Honeywell thermostats according to the support request I submitted to them."
4,Hyun Yu,"Highly recommendable product, I can suggest every home to install one if you dont have one yet. This thermostat is designed with so comprehensive ideas behind that it provides very smart and logical functions. Earlier, I bought Hunter Fans thermostat but the wall plate and body does not fit well, and the contacts are not reliable so I returned for refund. And, I bought this used item to save money and it did not come with installation instruction. When i asked for help, the seller emailed me with web page link and I could finish install in an hour. Excellent product."
5,Makes a Big Difference,"This thermostat helps keep the temperature stable using an old furnace. My unit was constantly running, but now temperature is more consistent."
2,does not function properly,Have tried several times to program this thermostat and it just does not respond to what is programed in. I am just switching from heat to cool as needed and using it manually.
5,works well,Replaced our old bulky one with this one and we love it! It offers the same programming functionality with a simpler approach and just 5 buttons! Looks sleek and clean. Great price!
5,DEADLY LULLABYE..LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great live album by a great song writer and killer lead singer.if you love king diamond,then you'll love the live album...id like to hear some more older stuff but the song list is still kick a**....so if you want to know how a live albums supposed to sound,getDeadly Lullabyes live..GRAND MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...WELCOME HOMEEEEEEEEEEEE...."
2,"Its ok, but....","I have played MOO2 and was excited about playing the 3rd installment. It had great potential but very poor execution of the game. The tech takes for ever to build up, the ships are extremely slow to build. The level of micro management is rediculous i think, but if your looking to blow some money on a less that ok game, get it."
5,in stock by amazon,amazon said Honeywell CT87K heat only thermostat is in stock and ships from amazon. So how come it did not ship in 1 or 2 days.?don't know how good the item is since amazon ships at snal speed. Some companies ship same day on orders before 1: PM and next day if after 1: PMBest to check all dealers before placeing orders.rated item at 5 stars even though i do not have it yet. Just a guess
3,All You Need,"I got sick and tired of everything having a stinking computer in it and I went back to this, the old standby. I couldn't care less if it has mercury in it or not. Shipping for this product was as prompt as it gets, at less that 24 hours. I will only say that the English language skills of the Amazon person who wrote this product page are extremely poor, as is common for young Americans today."
5,Amazing Book,"I recently received this book and it is the best martial arts book I have ever read. It had a plethora of pictures and clear writing. Most importantly it thoroughly covered the basics such as hand position, basic strikes, and basic blocks. The kata in the end left a little to be desired, but I could find no other flaws in the book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and I plan on buying Fumio Demura's other books on weapon fighting now."
3,Interesting companion to Robert Young's books on the PH diet,"This book is a interesting companion to Robert Young's ""PH Miracle diet"" series of books, and alkaline diet books in general...--- but forget it if you are entrenched into the mentality of the FDA, NIH, Big Pharma, and New England Journal of Medicine.This book isn't a tour de force of the most current scientific literature, nor the most up-to-date supplements, juicers, etc.Somewhat spiritual in his attempt to link diet and spirituality, but not overly so.Definitely a different approach than Young's...in his willingness to combine alkaline and acid foods...--- even though both authors focus on the alkaline diet."
1,I would give less than one star if possible!,"I think for those people who gave this book a good review, they are new to the alkalize train and were not aware that this book is nothing more than in infomercial that does not give any more information than most web sites. This book had nothing new or revolutionary to add. It was boring. It was a complete waste of money and as one who suffers from RA I was infuriated at yet another person capitalizing on the pains of others!"
1,Don't buy this book,"Do not buy this book! While it may have been useful 10 years ago, the FCC has changed the question pool. I discovered this after wasting about three weeks studying, when I decided to take a few of the exams that you can download from the FCC's website. Only 10% or so of the questions (at the most) in this book are actually in the question pool published by the FCC. This book should be removed from the market."
2,Good church sign message planning book,"While providing good information as to how a church sign message should be planned out, drafted, reviewed and approved, the actual sample church sign messages contained in the book seemed too local and ""cutesy"" for general use. Buy the book for the planning information, not the sample messages themselves."
3,"Listenable, but somehow not up tp potential.","Like Danny Gatton (who this sounds a lot like) the material doesn't seem to catch up to the player's potential. It's still a nice album, but somehow you know Mr. Levine has some better material somewhere."
3,Something is missing here,"I know many other reviewers think this is great cinema but for me something is missing. I remember the old Coppola's wonderful use of color and the richness of tones he used and unfortunately the choice to use digital black and white instead of the real thing misses the mark. To a film photographer it looks like a color image has been rendered in black and white. This may seem picky and it does go against others' experience but you just have to go back to a Bergman or similar film to see the difference - mostly gray tones here and few deep blacks or bright whites. For me the look of the film was boring and the story failed to engage me, probably my lack of intellectual insight or understanding or appreciation of theatricality, but I can't ignore the fact that it just didn't engage me."
5,As funny as we are stupid.,"These books hold records that you will never want to hold. But, be heartened that if you do grace the pages, you will never know it. Check out the product description above if you want to know what you're getting into. These are some of the funniest stories and are short enough to read during commercials.Somehow I wonder how many of my progeny will bless future volumes. Who knows, maybe it will even be me. I can only hope."
3,"Easy to set-up and use, but inaccurate temperature readings.","I purchased this thermostat to replace an old manual unit. I also liked the fact that it displayed both the room temperature and the set temperature. I used it for a year, and noticed as soon as I installed it that it was reading a temperature about 2 degrees higher that my what it actually was in the house. Additionally, it seemed to take forever for the temperature to drop or raise by as little as one degree. I exchanged it for the same unit, and had the same issues. I know that the temperature inaccuracy is not huge, but I am fickle, and a thermostat only has to do one job well, and this one could not do it accurately. I replaced it with the Lux TX9000TS and am much happier overall. Additionally, the Lux has a light button, so I can activate the backlight without pushing another button."
5,Excellent,This book arrived within days of my ordering it and it was in excellent condition---looked brand new! Thanks!
4,Chelkash,"Chelkash is a very deep story, which involves a thief named Chelkash and a young man on he finds on the street and hires. The story focuses on the use of the ocean to reflect moods and events as well as the importance of money in our society. The story leads one to question how far one would go for money. The book is much deeper than the story. One must take the time to think about it before the meaning becomes clear or one can simply enjoy the story which is a page turner."
4,Exciting Read,Interesting and exciting read. Very enthralling. This book takes the reader on a spell bound adventure based on Christian mythology. A new twist to the old stories.
2,crossword pluzzle dictionary review,I was very disappointed in this book. It does not go into detail. I don't use it very much because I know I can't find detailed info in it. I would not recommend a purchase of this book.
4,Great Customer Service,"Bought a set of the Bavaria salt/pepper mills less than a year ago at an outlet store, then another set online. Love the contemporary look, and the fact that the dispenser is on the top, so you don't have a mess on the table every time you set it down. Unfortunately, the plastic part that holds the grinder assembly broke on one of the pepper mills, a problem reported by others.While I'm not especially happy about my mill breaking, I have to say that the Olde Thompson customer service is outstanding. Rather than simply ordering another one online, I decided to call the company. A real person answered the phone, and directed me to a real customer service rep who picked up the phone immediately. She is sending a Fed Ex call ticket for free pickup of the broken pepper mill, took my address, and is sending a replacement. THIS is old-fashioned customer service the way it should be."
3,Lasted four years,"I wish this grinder had lasted much longer. It broke after only four years with normal use because the plastic piece inside that helps rotate the grinder snapped. Also annoying because the ""fully adjustable"" aspect always unwound itself to grind pepper coarsely with normal turning of the grinder's head unless it was readjusted every time."
1,rewview not purchased,"I have never received this book and I was actually ordering a different book when I ordered. I wanted to order the 9/11 book by LIFE magazine, not this one. Like I said; I wouldn't be able to critique this anyway because I never received it.Please let me know how to delete this order and re-order the one by LIFE magazine instead.Thank youNora Bartman"
5,Great Bang for the Buck!!,"I bought two sets of these to complete the connections between peripheral components and my Onkyo AV receiver. For the price ($6.49, these were a close-out purchase) I may not have been able to do better. I already own AR interconnect cables and have been pleased with it. The improvement in signal is dramatic over radio shack RCA cables. Very solid construction, works great. All my speakers and interconnects are by Audio Research."
3,Half and Half,"For months I had been looking forward to the release of Initiation. However, in comparison to the previous albums from The Start, I found Initiation a little disappointing. The songs ""All or Nothing"" and ""Like Days"" are my favorites, but also songs that are a true reflection of the talent this band has. However ""Life is Sweet"" and ""Dead End Queen"" just don't do it for me. As said previously, some songs are great new Start tracks while others sound like the band tried too hard."
1,Disappointed with the lightweight content,"Many interesting topics are addressed in the book, but without much insight or depth. There is a brief intro by the author, followed by what might be an e-mail exchange with someone else on that particular subject. Not much insight. In at least some instances, many important authorities for a subject are not mentioned.I bought the book based on all of the other reviews, which seem to be very positive. My experience was quite different. To me the treatment was introductory and basic, so someone with some familiarity with finance might want to look elsewhere."
4,Lean este Libro!!!,"Este es uno de los libros mas maravillosos que he leido. Es una obra que se puede leer en varios niveles. Es decir, se la puede tomar simplemente como una apasionante historia de secuestros, detectives e intrigas, o se puede ir mas alla y extraer el profundo mensaje que tiene.En esencia este es un libro en el que los personajes tratan de encontrar su mision en la vida, el significado de su existencia en este mundo y al final lograr aceptar el paso del tiempo apreciando que en cada etapa de nuestra vida tenemos algo que aprender y algo que ganar.Es un libro que lo recomiendo enteramente ya sea solo para pasar un buen rato leyendo una historia que te atrapa desde la primera pagina, o para quienes deseen comprender una muy interesante filosofia de vida."
4,It's Magic!!!,"A few years ago,I got this Cd for my birthday and I am so glad that I did.Almost every classic Doris song is on here and each with it's own specialness to it.It's a perfect mix between soft and fun songs with some of my favorites being Pillow Talk,Move Over Darling,Ready Willing and Able, and of course Secret Love.The only downside is that there aren't more of the ones from some of her later movies like Send me no Flowers or April in Paris.On the whole this Cd has great songs that are great to sing along to anywhere at anytime!!"
4,This is not the original 1864 book by Ticknor,"I own a copy of the original edition of Ticknor's ""Life of William Hickling Prescott"". The original edition contained pen and ink illustrations at the head of each chapter. Furthermore, the original edition that I own was typeset using the ""long s"" and the ""short s"" so that it takes some conditioning of the mind to read what appears to be ""From thefe, and fimilar maffes of manufcript, were felected .."" as ""From these, and similar masses of manuscript, were selected .."". This reprint edition is definitely a fascimile of a later version for which the type for the entire book had been reset. Apparently this latter version omitted the illustrations that definitely add character to the original 1864 printing."
1,Buying a Apex product was a HUGE mistake!,"I bought this item with a mail in rebate making it cost about $79 bucks last December. Hooked it up around March and didn't start using it til almost Summer. Mid Summer, viewing anything with this product on my tv was getting annoying with the fact it was doing some weird fade in and outs just being ""on""..So one day mid Summer..With the unit being off for two days, I touched the top of it and it was BURNING hot even though it was OFF. It wouldn't turn on (and I had had problems in the spring with it being plugged in but wouldn't turn on)... So I took the top off and the power supply burned out..I called & emailed Apex several times only to have them say I have to pay for shipping and labor to fix a problem that is clearly their fault on a brand new unit! I think this calls for a class action suit!!!!"
1,Just pray you never need customer service...,"I bought a similar ""value"" Apex DVD players from Amazon a while back. The thing had an annoying hum at times, but worked... at first. After two months it wouldn't play DVDs longer than maybe 90 minutes. I tried calling their service line - no one answered the phone. I went to their Website and wrote to their service e-mail address - I received no response, ever.My guess is they figure (rightly) that no one is going to go to a lot of legal trouble over a device that costs less than $100. There are other companies that make low-end DVD players and other equipment - patronize one of them instead of Apex."
2,Beware of Apex's future,"While the Apex DRX-9200 is a better-quality product than its predecessor (which has been discontinued), it still feels low-quality when compared to Panasonic DVD recorders. It also does *not* work with DVD-R or DVD-RW, but only the ""plus"" format. I think it looks a bit ugly and is a bit on the heavy side.But the main problem is the future of Apex Digital. According to the New York Times (12/28/04), the company owes its Chinese supplier over half a billion dollars in unpaid bills, and its president was arrested by the Chinese police for ""[...]."" From the recent lack of new products from this company and the horrible customer support it provides to customers, I'll caution anyone about buying an Apex. Yes this is a bargain, but if yours doesn't work a couple months from now, you might not be able to get it fixed. (But then again, this recorder is only $120 after rebate...)"
3,Question not a comment,"So without turning into a technical geek, is this better than a VCR. I'll cut off some comments bound to come. Yes, I know there is probably a better model out there for about double the price but for $100 is this worth it?1. Does it play DVDs?2. Will it record shows off the tv as good as a midline VCR?"
3,Mathematics,This was ordered for my daughter for a college class. She was glad to have to book for class but it was not a favorite of hers.
3,Good,the book was like brand new. i had an issue with shipment when i emailed the sender he told me what had happened and told me what i had to do. everything in the end worked out and i received the book.
3,good insights,Very interesting in places. Just seems to be tantalizingly remote lifestyle. It made me feel I knew the Dalai Lama better from seeing the life that these monks live.
2,back of beyond,"As I read Back of Beyond by Sarah Ellis, I found myself asking myself why this was supposed to be stories about supernatural events, because as far as I could tell these stories mainly included lonely kids whos parents were either divorced or just didn't exist in general. Most of these short stories were about strange appearances of someone or something or strange disappearances of people or things. As far as I could tell there weren't any aliens or supernatural life involved in any of the short stories. These kids in every story just seemed to happen upon something while they were moping because they were depressed or angered about their ""destructive"" families. The even weirder part was that at the end of the story, after all of their strange happenings most of them were still sad and/or upset. Oh and if you were wondering this is in the genre short stories."
2,Surprisingly dry and tedious.,I had high hopes for the book after hearing the author on the radio but I found the book to be really heavy on physics and lacking in references to Star Trek. Einstein's own writings are lighter and more enjoyable to read. I recommend the Technical Manual instead.
4,All Trekkies should read this,"Interesting although sometimes you lose it if you are not good in math.Of course it makes you look at the series in a different perspective, getting some fun out of it.But still it is a nice book even if it destroys some of the best science of the series"
2,I await what is more substantial.,"Notable achievement for a first real collection but my overall view is that the work is self-serving, self-justifying and lacking in any of the real honesty its tone lays claim to. Many parts are clichéd, the only crime in this being that the clichés do not even seem to connect with the writer on the level suggested, let alone a reader. I thought Kahn used too many words; conveyed an expectation of the reader to devour and accept rather than to read. The entire collection screams 'read me, analyze me!' but analysis proves disappointing. Not poor, but I definitely thought the work was 'trying to be' rather than just being. Perhaps he writes too close to home."
5,Life Altering,"Kris Kahn's words flow through the reader, winding and weaving their way through the bloodstream. His images are mind blowing and he allows you inside his psyche and his heart. This book will change you. He is one of the greatest poets of our time and I personally cannot wait to see what he'll come up with next."
5,Other Peoples Money...,"That this book was written nearly 100 years ago makes it somewhat harder to read due to style and useage differences. However, this is a small caveat. What I found rather unnerving was how much of what Justice Brandeis said then about a different crisis, sounded like it could have been written about our current financial crisis.I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the financial history of the country. And to anyone who enjoys an excercise in ""the more things change...""."
4,Willie Nelson and Friends,There isn't anything about Willie Nelson I don't like. I also enjoyed PBS's Last of the Breed Live In Concert and it got misplaced coming back from up North and to get it from Amazon(if I'm not mistaken) when I wrote to them if there was a chance I could get it again and they requested to try Amazon.
1,"More River, Less People","Pollution, poverty and a plague of people and animals are all richly illustrated. The river is mainly a backdrop."
1,Leaked everywhere,Don't buy this product!! The box arrived completely soaked through and the bottle was empty.
3,Almost a great design,"I went looking for a glass salt mill- almost all are plastic. This one is very well made-- sturdy, well finished, quality materials. Two reservations. The push-off cap covers the mechanism and is removed for use. It is awkward to remove and quickly gets worse. It is held on with an 0-ring. The 0-ring gets dirty from salt and binds. Removing the 0-ring leaves the cap loose and wobbly. I replaced the 0-ring with a rubber band. Seems to work ok. The mill is intended to stand upright with the mechanism on the top and turned upside down to operate. The mechanism is unattractive. It is black so it always looks dirty with salt. It should have been white. They could have at least used an attractive finial on the coarseness setting screw. Instead a bare common screw sticks up in the center."
2,"Common befits this book, which is a shame.","I joyfully read Jan Karon's Mitford series to learn more about Mitfordians, as they feel like real neighbors and friends. It's apparent this book was produced at the behest of someone other than the author herself. Normally, she fills her books with thoughtful and apt turns of phrase, showing us the highs and lows of various lives, coloring and shading with rich dialects. While this book has the characters we've come to know, it rings hollow. It's a shame, too, because I felt a real let down while reading the book. I'm halfway through it and don't really have the inspiration to finish. We know Father Tim and Cynthia married, so there's no stone left unturned.I give the book two stars because I don't ""hate it"", as a one-star review might reflect. It's a large disappointment."
2,A let down ...,"Though the book claims to be in the 180 page range, it's really much less with its HUGE margins and blank pages separating the chapters. It skips around A LOT -- doesn't cover the whole summer that they're engaged and says NOTHING of the actual reception. Which could have been such a pleasure to read! The only good part of the book is the deeper look into Cynthia that you get. If you're a diehard Mitford fan, you're going to buy it no matter what. Just DON'T expect Karon to keep up her track record. And it seems it'll be quite some time until we get another Mitford like we expect -- in the spirit of J.K. Rowling, Karon will be publishing two mini books this coming Fall which will only take away from the next full size Mitford novel."
1,A sad disappointment,"Like many others, I, too, was terribly disappointed with Jan Karon's latest episode from wonderful Mitford. I did want to read about wedding trials, tribulations and joys of Father Tim and Cynthia, but found a lot of white space and fluff instead.And I also found a glaring mistake. When the second novel ended with the publishing of the banns for the couple, the Main Street Grill had been forced to close due to rot in the basement. Ms. Karon seems to have forgotten this as the Grill was going strong as A Common Life begins. It would not have been open again for two months. Shame on the editors and on Ms. Karon for missing this important detail."
1,Ug!,"Fortunately for me, I was able to read this book between book 2 and 3 and not at the end of the series as so many disappointed readers have. Too bad that didn't help make this a worthwhile read. I noticed that the page numbers were obscured by a clever scroll put over them; an attempt to hide the scant number of them no doubt. Heavy paper stock, wide margins and large type makes this short story SEEM like a novel but it clearly is not. I will finish the series glad that the worst of them is behind me. Rehashed events and lengthy prayers do not a novel make. Borrow, don't buy this one."
4,"Good, but too short!","I can never say a bad word about any of the Mitford books, this one being no exception. It wasn't as good as the other 5, but I did enjoy it. We go back in time to the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia and how he proposed to her. Jan Karon is such a talented writer, and as usual I hated to see the story end. If I were going to complain it would be that the book was too short. I was listening to it on Recorded Books Audio and out of the blue the narrator said, ""the end"". I was so surprised as there was still one whole tape left to listen to (which ended up being an interview with Jan Karon). If you have read the other 5 novels about Mitford then this book is a must, but a reader might not get much out of it if they start with this book. The characters aren't delved into very deeply."
2,Very Disappointing,I was thrilled to preorder the book and couldn't wait to be the first on the block to read this. I couldn't be more disappointed. Where were the characters we loved? Nothing was in any depth and I thought that maybe this was a way of making money off the parts that had originally been edited out. I'm sorry I wasted my money and my excitement.
4,Short but Sweet,"Any visit to Mitford is a worthwhile trip. Even though this book is shorter and more simplistic than the others in the series, I enjoyed reading about the characters we've come to know and love. It was great beach reading! As an author myself, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL (Judson Press), I appreciate the small details that add so much color to Jan Karon's stories. Mitford fans will understand that this book is like looking through a dear friend's wedding album. Enjoy!"
4,Everyday Life,I enjoyed reading this book very much.It took me back to when life was so much simplier than it is today. I love weddings and this story was all about planning and attending a wedding.
5,all the midford series,I love all of the books in the Midford Series. Jan Karon's books are heart warming and feel good. Her books make you feel good!
1,"A Common Life: The Wedding Story (The Mitford Years, Book 6)","The book is out of print and I wanted to give it to my sister for Christmas. It got here in time and the only damage was to the cover, not enough to matter. Very pleased and will use this web site again."
1,Karen fails Father Tim and his readers,"Having read the first book of the Mitford Series in 24 hours and the next four within two weeks, I preordered ""The Wedding Story"" months in advance. What a disappointment!! It appears that Ms. Karon has succombed to money and making her publishers happy by pumping out a book rehashing old topics and leaving the reader wanting. Her advertisement at the end regarding a book of Father Tim's favorite quotes further fuels the impression that she's on a capitalistic turn rather than a literary one. PLEASE give us more of the good father and his adventures!!"
2,No digressing please...,"I thought the story was readable, for it did fill in the blanks in reference to ""their wedding"" but go to your local libray to get in on this read. The story was much too short, especially for the purchasing price. I would much preferred to have had the author continue with the series picking up where the 5th book left off. Ms. Karon is a wonderful writer and this series of books have been a very favorite of mine. Please Ms. Karon, don't stop writing about this wonderful family and group of people...just please go forward taking all of us along on their wonderful journey, as you have in the past."
3,PUBLISHER FOR SHAME FOR SHAME,The characters we love are the same. The story is weaker than those in the previous five books. Jan Karon must be exhausted. Clearly the book was influenced by the publisher....
2,Still Waiting,"After reading the first few pages of A Common Life, I knew this was not the sixth book of the Mitford series that I'd long been waiting for. Instead what I read was a pretty little book that, for someone who's read the series twice, contained nothing but yesterday's news. My recommendation: Buy this book as a gift for a friend who's never read anything by Jan Karon. It's a sweet story and a new reader will love it. As for the rest of us Karon fans - all we can do is hope that our book is still out there!"
1,Written in 5 minutes,"Not sure why Jan Karon even wrote this book. It gives you nothing new to the story. It was written as if her publisher wanted something new so she wrote this in 5 minutes just to please her publisher. This book is so unlike her other books. She's a wonderful writer with stories that just sweep you off your feet and characters that find their way into your heart to stay. As far as this book is concerned, don't waste your time."
1,"a common, boring, disappointment...","i should have believed the poor reviews but had to find out for myself...the book was an absolute bore...i kept reading and hoping that something/anything was going to happen...this is such a common, boring, disappointment to an avid reader of life in mitford...but this will not stop me from buying/reading the next book in the mitford series - i can only pray to the lord's chapel that jan karon returns to her familiar format and cast of characters that most of us have grown to know and love!"
1,Entertainment,I read the book and 110 of the posted reviews. I found the reviews much more entertaining and interesting than the book!
1,From a very disappointed reader,I just can't imagine WHY Jan Karon didn't write about the wedding in sequence. To write about it now seems strange and needless. I will think carefully before I buy another one of her books.
3,Not So Great,The steaks I ordered were fine. The fish was mushy and greasy. I found a bone in one. Not my favorite. Also I don't like how fattening they turned fish. It was very high calories.
2,Different,"The fish is a bit rubbery and bland. Lots of garlic flavor, but no taste of shrimp at all. Not bad, but not good. I'll stick to the steaks."
4,Does the job,"This is really firm foam, which I suppose is good or it would mush down like a pillow instead of lift the knees but it is hard enough that it can get uncomfortable after a couple hours of use. I took off one star because it is nearly impossible to get the cover off without ripping it."
3,Kinda Cheap,"It's kind of cheap but so is the price. I like it much better than using a pillow and am happy with purchase. When it's worn out I may look into one made of memory foam, but I'm sure those may be a hundred bucks or more. I think most people on a budget will like this one. It is firm but I don't agree with the reviewers who said it's a rock."
5,PERFECT For Spasticity And Neuropathy Due To Advanced Multiple Sclerosis,"I have advanced Multiple Sclerosis, and suffer from Neuropathy and Spasticity as a result. The ""Mabis/DMI healthcare Elevating Leg Rests, Blue"" deals with both of those symptoms quite nicely.For Neuropathy - This product forces me to lie on my back, while keeping my legs apart, without having anything between my legs in order to do it.For Spasticity - This product keeps my knees bent in the perfect position, thereby preventing 90% to 95% of the spasms my legs experience when they're straight.It does both of these things with continued comfort and support, and zero awkwardness. Being bedridden for the most part has been much more bearable as a result.Therefore, I highly recommend anyone who suffers from Spasticity and Neuropathy due to advanced Multiple Sclerosis to ditch their lumpy, uneven pillows, and go with this product instead. You won't regret it."
4,Leg rest from heaven,Very good quality foam and an exellent value. Cover isn't heavy duty but washable and soft to the touch.
1,Elevating leg rest,"The leg rest wasn't long enough for both legs to rest comfortably. The picture showed to be around 30 inches, the actual measurement was 16 inches, which is not long enough to keep both legs on while sleeping without them slipping off."
5,Great book of a great product,"Great diagrams, and instruction. Step by step with photos if each . makes painting look fun and easy. Can't wait to use these ideas."
5,great performance at a great price,these cables have a poor pictures but they are very sturdy compared to other component cables I have used and are much cheaper then them too.
5,Learn how to look at your dreams to wake up!,"I don't read self-help books and surely don't read anything by anyone on dreams, except for maybe Carl Jung, Marie-Louise von Franz or Robert Johnson. `Radical Dreaming' changed that for me. For those of you looking for step-by-step ""answers"" to your dreams, you will be disappointed here. For those of you wishing to open up to new worlds, this book could very well change your life. Radical in the sense that it dares to go beyond Jung's ideas and challenges what we have thought about dream work up until now. Radical also in how it will shake up your status quo existence. A must have for the nighttime dreamer."
3,"Works well, but clean up is a mess and very noisy","This vac is a great value and I would recommend purchasing it. Be forewarned though. Emptying the bagless chamber is a messy process and can involve cleaning a half dozen different parts in the sink. Also the vac is very noisy and quite heavy. It does pick up a LOT of stuff and does a good job sucking. (In fact, I was trully disgusted at what was in the chamber after a few minutes running over what I THOUGHT were my relatively clean carpeted floors.) The headlight is suprisingly bright. For eighty bucks - it is worth it. I expect it to last a year or two - typical for vacs in this price range."
1,Dies within one year,"Like many of you, I was very happy with this vacuum, until it died on me last month. I've only had it for about 10 months. It overheats easily, the rubber belt burns and starts to smell, and it stopped sucking. Even before it died, I had to take it apart and unclog the tubes many times. While it was a good vacuum while it lasted, I would definitely recommend spending more money on a vacuum that will last you longer than a year. No more cheap vacuums for me!"
2,"Powerful vacuum, useless tools","This vacuum is powerful. It works well on big area floor. But if you want to use those on-board tools on hard-to-reach area or furnitures, it will be very dispointing. This is a big design flaw of this vacuum. There is a floor brush on the bottom of this vacuum. The brush works efficiently to loose the dirts from carpet and let the hose, which locate behind the brush, to suck them up. When you want to use those tools, you have to pull the hose from the bottom and connect it with the tool. However, the floor brush still works! Now you can imagine what will happen. The powerful high speed brush throws all dirts from floor through the bottom opening and these dirts happily fly over in your room."
1,ANOTHER belt problem!,"As was mentioned several times, the cleaning power of this machine is awesome (even with 2 long haired cats) but it just doesn't hold up. The 1st machine I purchased had the roller seize up and the belt burning the 2nd time it was used. Thinking this was just a fluke, I returned it to Walmart and got another one. This time the plastic piece holding the roller brush disintegrated and the belt burning smell occurred after 2 months of use. Buyer beware!"
1,Worked great for the first several months....,"I, too, loved this vacuum when I purchaced it. There was nothing it couldn't pick up. I have had it for almost nine months now, and it does not pick anything up anymore. I am so sick of going over the same areas again and again and then finally getting on my hands and knees to pick stuff up. I have changed the filters and the belt brush, and nothing works. This vacuum is a rip off. Save your receipt!!!!"
5,One of the Best Films of 1998.,"When a Depressed Ant named Z (Voiced by Three Time Oscar-Winner:Woody Allen) has fallen in Love with the Princess (Voiced by Sharon Stone) but when a dangerous double crossing General (Voiced by Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) wants to start a new colony and destorying the rest of the Ants.Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. This film has a Great Supporting Cast-Including:Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, Oscar-Winner:Christopher Walken, Oscar-Winner:Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Paul Mazursky, John Mahoney, Grant Shaud, Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin. One of the Biggest Hits of 1998. Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) is Superb. Produced by the same studio-Dreamworks (They Produced):The Box Office Smash CGI Film-Shrek. Written by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. Chris and Paul Weitz Produced the American Pie Films. Grade:A."
3,Not as good,"This is a Woody Allen movie. From the opening shot to the dialogue, it's a constant surprise how much this resembles other Woody Allen Movies.It doesn't have the charm and good nature of ""Bug's Life"" and I'm not sure I'd show it to younger children. In fact, there are some scenes later in the movie that are downright gruesome.But there's some wit here, and it's definately worth a look, if not a buy."
5,WONDERFUL FILM,I LOVE THE PART ABOUT ANTOPIAS AND INSECTOPIAS IT BROUGHT RELIZIM INTO THE FILM...WE ARE ALL SERCHING TO BE NOTICED AND SERCHING FOR THE PERFECT PLACE.
2,No More Antz,I was really disappointed in this. Glad we only rented this one!!! I thought it would be colorful and cute just like the Bug Movie...not even close! The colors were dreadful and the storyline sure was not for little ones. Our daughter likes bugs so I thought she might enjoy this one. None of us enjoyed this one!!!
2,Thought it was for kids - thought wrong,"I just bought this video because I thought it would be a good one for my son. He does like it, but I don't think it was necessary to have any four letter words in this movie. It would have been much better without them. I know any day now my son is going to start repeating Bala's Dammit! My son is also asking me what happened to the guy(Barbados) in the ant vs. termite scene. Big disappointment, I will know better to just rent next time."
3,"if you want a harder, edgier Bugs Life then you'll want to see this","i saw both Antz and A Bugs Life in the theaters in 1998 and it was pretty much like seeing the rated and unrated versions of the same movie. Both are about ants, both have a loner ant, and both have the loner ant cause the problem and find the solution. Antz is just the adult version of a very good childrens film called A Bugs Life."
2,Not for Kids,"This movie had a lot of graphic violence, including a war against termites, and a scene of torture. It also had some sexual innuendo. I did not think it was appropriate for children. It was also very much a Woody Allen Movie. My daughter, age 6, wasn't very interested in it. We won't be watching it again."
2,Not a kids' movie,"As with most animated movies these days, this movie is entertaining for adults as well. However, Antz has a lot of profanity and some violence in it, so parents beware. This is not a cartoon kiddie movie - it is rated PG for a reason. Good movie overall, just two stars to get your attention that it's not for kids."
1,DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE,"I'm sorry to say this, but this movie sucked. These characters are even ugly for animated bugs. And they all have horrible sences of humor, think they're funny but they're actually not. They have terrible personalities as well. This movie sucked to the extreme. I know a person, Geremy Patko, who liked this movie. Probably no one who will read this knows him, but he's in 10th grade. He's messed up though. All I'm saying is that seeing this movie will be a complete waste of yuor time. Thank you."
1,Certainly not very mature,"Bland violence and bad taste in a mediocre animation film does NOT make it more mature or ""edgy."" It just makes it unwatchable. I hope Dreamworks grows up soon."
1,NOT appropriate for kids!,"The words ""what the hell"" occurred a couple of times, and a lot of sexual references as well. Mistake buy for my 10 and 2 year old. I was more upset and really couldn't enjoy it as an adult, either."
1,Not For Kids,This movie looks like a children's movie but I wouldn't recommend it. They slip swear words in like it's nothing. Should have a higher rating.
3,A bit twi,"THis book basically covers a variety of styles with which a young woman might want to decorate her bedroom. For example, ""Eco Chic"", French 17th Century, Modern, Retro etc. Some of the pictures here are really nice, particularly the Dangerous Liaisons and the Boho look, but unfortunately they felt it necessary to include photographs of models lounging in the rooms, something I found a little bit twi and annoying. The other problem is that this book seems targeted at young women, however the decoration suggestions of some of the rooms are quite high budget, for example Louis 15th style chairs, and so might not be appropriate for the average 20year olds income. Otherwise the book is quite good fun and I'm sure fulfils its main purpose...to inspire."
2,Meade ETX90EC,"A nice telescope that will disappoint. Polar alignment is almost impossible because of the location of the finder scope. Without polar alignment capabilities you can forget about photography. If you insist on buying this model then go ahead and order an angled finder scope for another $60. The straight through finder scope that comes with the ETX-90 is useless since you can't see through it while aligning on Polaris.The optics are excellent with no noticeable color fringes.The AutoStar locator/tracker leaves much to be desired. After spending many minutes performing a polar alignment, the AutoStar reset itself and ""Initialized"". Did the alignment again, moved to Mars for some photography and the AutoStar ""Initialized"" again. I found that a light tap on the side of the scope caused it to initialize - losing all alignment setting. Apparently there is a loose connector/cable inside it!!!I suggest buying a Celestron."
4,Almost perfect small scope with gorgeous optics,"This is amazing. I took this out to a dark sky area (which I can't do with my other giant scope, since i own a tiny car) and the results were breathtaking. You can get some nice wide views with this, and the variable motor control is so good. It is rather startling how good the optics are in this-when peering in, it looks like the quality of a slightly larger average (5 or 6 inch) scope.The downside is the Go-To is persnikkety at best. I have not got it to work, and others I know have had issues with this model. But, for grab and go and optical quality alone, its totally worth it.Bonus: I highly recommend getting a solar filter, Telrad, and focus motor for this as essential add-ons."
3,Not as represented.,"I was looking for a nice ice bucket to add to my already silver laden dining room. I love the look of this item and the handle was mostly the selling point for me, along with the fact that it would be one piece of silver I did not have to polish.The ""no polishing"" turned out to be a joke, and the joke is on me. After many times of trying to pretend that a soft cloth would clean my ice bucket, I finally broke down a polished the nasty looking thing.Another thing that concerned me is that there is no marking whatsoever on this ice bucket. I called Reed & Barton to ask about this and they said it probably was theirs but to buy direct from them from now on to be sure. However, now that I have had to polish it I am sure I did get silver plate as is represented.I would buy this item again, but I would liked to know the truth about what I was purchasing."
3,GOOD QUALITY SCANNABLE CD. THIS IS NOT A BOOK.,"The quality of this CD is very good. However, there is no indication that this is a CD and NOT a book, until you receive it."
5,"Wonderful book for older children, teens","This is one of my favorite books ( like all of Madeline E'Lengle's books ) The language and point of view were excellent and the main character's feelings were beautifully portrayed. I, however believe that 9-12 years is to young a reading level and recommend it for an older audience. I recommend all of L' Engles books but beware of the age levels, they change dramatically from book to book."
5,"Vicky, Adam, Zach, and so many more... a WONDERFUL book.","I absolutely adore this book. I am fifteen, and out of all L'Engle's books, this and Troubling a Star are my favorites. Vicky is a girl who reminds a few people (like me) of themselves, and alot of people of a friend, or someone they'd like to be or get to know. I love all of the Austin Books, though I recommend this one for a 13+ age range to really appreciate it, and understand the power to L'Engle/Vicky's words.Also, L'Engle's descriptions of dolphin-human communication are, to this marine biologist wannabe, fabulous. You would think she's a marine biologist!!! (is she??) I am fascinated, and they make me love science and the ocean even more than I already did."
5,The best book I have ever read!,"This book has it all: good characters who I actually liked, good writing, and a good idea. It's now my favorite book!"
4,A teenage coming of age book with depth,"Two boys are vying for Vicky's attention, but Vicky likes Zachary. Leo Rodney's father died, and now Leo is trying to be Vicky's boyfriend. Then Vicky meets Adam Eddington and starts experiments with dolphins, and she can communicate with the dolphins! But will the sorrow death, which seems to hang constantly, get the best of her? This is an excellent, sensitively written book with the depth and thought-provoking reading that only Madeline L'Engle can master. It is deep, wondeful, and the only reason I gave four, not five stars is because some of the dating scenes get a little ""strange""--not suggestive at all, but still, unusual for this kind of book. Indeed, it has mature themes, and I wouldn't reccomend it for YOUNG readers, but every teen--even boys--should read this. It's magnificent. P.S. IM REALLY 15 BUT THE ADULT FORM IS BROKEN :)"
4,DREW'S GRANDFATHER GOES MAD,"Robert Louis Stevenson cranked out finely plotted, freshly original stories like clockwork. He was the Stephen King of his time and, like King, excelled at horror. John Barrymore was perhaps the most famous stage performer of his time. Known more today as Drew's grandfather and at the end of his short life, a sad alcoholic reflection of his former charisma. In this terrific 1920 version of ""DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE,"" Barrymore's early brilliance is showcased in this first great American horror film that holds its own in the 21st century. In fact, it even has an enhanced, eerie period feel that amps up the dangerous and ill-fated experiment by the curios doctor who discoverz the shadow side of civilization and self. The Mont Alto Orchestra delivers a fine score and the DVD bonus material features a rare 1909 audio recording of the transformation scene, a 1925 one-reel parody starring a goofy Stan Laurel, an excerpt from a rival 1920 version and more."
2,Really wanted to like it,"As has been pointed out, these are new recordings of old songs. and has been pointed out, none of these versions is significantly different than the originals, and none of these performances surpasses the originals. It's not a bad album, but for those of us who listened to this band when it was new, there's nothing added here. If you are new to GOF, buy History of the 20th century or Entertainment. This was a great band worth checking out, but I can't say that about this recording."
4,"Good songs, great voice","This is not mediocre-quality indie-pop. This lady actually has some talent. Her voice is gossamer and some of her arrangements (especially Primordial Soup) and chord voicings (several songs) suggest a much better rapport with the guitar and with music in general than might be expected from an indie folkster. The only complaint is that the disc's overall sound is somewhat subdued (compared to her live sound, which is more dynamic) and at times is glazed over by the production of the disc (a couple of the songs, the lazier, more ephemeral tunes, like ""Sister,"" the production actually enhances the song), but the quality of the songs more than makes up for it... she is a truly gifted writer."
1,No star for this item should be the right rating!,Horrible! Go to Target or Walmart! This lamp is the worst piece of junk ever created!!! I wouldn't even get it for free!Overall: Junk!
1,You get what you pay for,I had this lamp less than 3 hours and it broke. The shades are flimsey. Now only one light will turn on. Do not get this product. Totally not worth it.
5,Scary 70's style nature run amuck with a twist ...FUN,"I never heard of Rick Hautala before, and I have a huge collection of horror novels...go figure?. I really like the straight forward clear writing style, the suspense kept me glued to the pages to the very end and above all ""LITTE BROTHERS"" is scary, really scary! I'm a sucker for anything with a monster in it and this book delivered more than it's share of them. I have recently purchased every Hautala book I can find...I am now currently reading Bedbugs and I love it!!! Finally... an author that tells a story without getting bogged down in excessive plot twists, with redneck blue coller characters, countless pages of descriptions (KING), or trying to be too literary that it puts you to sleep(STRAUB), so disposable, commercial and predictable(KOONTZ), cheap porn(LAYMON), Mr. Hautala is none of the above, he's better and I'm glad he's still around."
5,A wonderful historical novel and love story,"The Last of the Wine is one of Mary Renault's wonderful historical novels about ancient Greece. It is told through the eyes of Alexias, a young Greek boy, whose father is a knight. Socrates, Alkibiades, and Plato all appear in this terrific novel. Highly recommended."
3,Book needed better checkup before selling,The book was missing middle sections of at least one page that I can't imagine happening any way but in manufacturing. A piece of page was torn at the binding but only a three inch piece. All the page edges were complete. Weird! Also there were highlights and edge notes in pen. Not exceptable for a very good rating. Otherwise it's a great read!
3,What's the antibacterial agent in this cleanser?,"This is fine; it's truly unscented and gentle enough that I can use it several times a day. It's wonderfully priced for a 12-ounce bottle. But I took the description here on Amazon at its word that it was antibacterial without reading the ingredients until after I'd already received it. There is no active, antibacterial ingredient in it. I'm disappointed; I was initially thrilled to find an antibac liquid hand soap that didn't stink to high heaven and trigger another one of my migraines. But there's nothing in it that kills bacteria. I'll finish it, but I'll check the ingredients before buying the next one (if one exists: I may just go with antibac dishwashing liquid.)"
4,"Seems OK, but be careful","Only used it once to start a car, had it about two months. Worked great in that one use. However:1)This unit is somewhat dangerous. It came without any covers for the live (always live!!) copper teeth. This could cause a short and possible fire hazard. No 'on-off switch' on this. Be careful how and where you store this.2)Cables are short, you must tie it to your engine well or have someone hold it. If it ever fell into your engine it could do some damage.Unit is heavy, has a nice guage to see how it is charging and how much charge is left. Comes with 12Volt carger so can be charged in a car, also can be plugged in with (not provided) extension cord into household 120V power. A 'normal' extdension cord works fine but it won't fit one with multiple female ends.I will update this review after I use it more."
3,Ehhh,"mixed feelings. I bought this item on a black friday deal and regretted it instantly. Tried to return it but i couldnt since it has a battery in it and its ""HAZARDOUS"". (then how come they can ship it to me but i cant ship it back?) It works great and i have used a couple of times. The only gripe is that there are better products on the market ( not for the same price). The big problem is that in order to charge this unit, you have to have a single outlet extention cord. The unit does not come with an AC charging cord. WHY?"
2,Don't buy this product if you live in a cold climate.,I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for someone that has problems with their automobile during cold weather. I thought it would be great if they could carry a charger in their car to avoid having to ask a stranger for a jump during the cold weather of Wisconsin winters. When reading the directions I was surprised to learn the charger should not be stored in an area which is colder than 50 degrees. Seriously? Why would you need a charger if its warmer than 50 degrees unless you are foolish enough to drain your car battery because you leave your lights on.Not sure if the charger will be returned.
2,Too much for hot wires,"I did not realize the cable would be live/hot all the time. For this price, it should have an on / off switch. Otherwise it seems good. Like the digital read out, and it jumped my quad 4 times straight out of the box."
3,I've come to expect less . . . .,"When Lisa Scottoline's career began, I had high hopes for the author and her strong female lead characters. I was not disappointed . . . in the beginning.However, some of her more recent works (this book included) are proof that success has its pitfalls.While I like Scottoline's heroine Mary DiNunzio and her south Philly family roots, this story strayed way beyond the credible. . . at least to me.The Japanese war camp story was interesting, but the way Scottoline tied all the loose ends together wasn't at all tidy or believable.I hope the author goes back to HER roots . . . tidy, tight legal thrillers."
3,Slow moving mystery,This is my first book by the author. I enjoyed the twist at the end of the book but overall I felt there were several sections of the book that really dragged. Other parts were just ridiculous and tough to believe. Then there are just a few romantic parts thrown in here and there that just seemed to have no relevance to the story. This book was free on the community bookshelf in my building - I am not sure I would pay for one of her mysteries.
5,good story,particularly enjoyed this story because it was based on true events during the second world war. It is my first Scotilone book.
5,I dunno what y'all are doing...,"It has worked fine for me since I got it. Hasn't messed up. I've used it with both my Zune HD and my first generation Zune 30g. I think it was worth every penny. Though, I do wish the cord was a little bit longer."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A doctor, sick of the corporate shill he is becoming goes to work in Central Africa. He gets obsessed with finding water, as well as being in the middle of a small military conflict.When lots of water does happen to come around he starts to get loopier and loopier, hunting for its source, with a young girl he has a demented Lolita thing for, while he does his little Heart of Darkness adventure on a boat."
3,"A Conrad-ish ride high on character, short on substance","After the successful ""Empire of the Sun"" Ballard obviously wanted to continue in the adventure world. Indeed, this was obviously written for his newfound audience as one finds no traces of the sexual/violent extremes some of his earlier work embraces. What he does embrace is the character of one Dr. Mallory, and the river he inadvertenly ""invents."" Mallory is a mercurial ride in narrator fashion, though you never get much further than his obsession with the river. This, in fact, is the problem with the entirety of the book. Everyone, including the river itself, is given a complex single-faceted personality (make sense?) and what this inevitably leaves the reader with is a spark of intrigue, but never a feeling of real involvement. That greatly hurts an adventure work, such as this one, where Ballard doesn't have his tremendous imagination to fall back on. Overall, a pretty good time, but definitely not one of his best"
4,New Songs,"My 5yr old daughter loves to play on her keyboard and sing along but we are unable to find any new songs. We have the one that came with it but would like to get her more. Where would I go to get this and what do I ask for? Toy R Us,Target,K-Mart and Wal-Mart did not have any nor knew what I was asking for. Please help me her birthday is in May and that is all she keeps asking for"
1,"Rubber rings were quickly lost, top would then not stay on.","Rubber rings were quickly lost, top would then not stay on. Impossible to replace the parts. Waste of money, poor value."
4,Good pen for wallet,"The previous pen I hung in my wallet a littli longer and was very adequate. This pen ok too. It starts right off writing. No scratching beforie it gets going, tight closing. Very Satisfied"
1,There are better out there,"If you love Sherlock Holmes, and know Sherlock Holmes, this production will greatly disappoint you. Personally, I am fond of the Jim French versions. They are more in tune with the real character, and much more entertaining."
5,Nice job!,My son is crazy about Harry Potter. An this set was reasonably price and in perfect condition.
5,Demystifying High Availability In The New Age of Technology,"It isn't often that a single book can deliver solutions to so many issues that plague enterprise executives and system administrators alike, but this book delivers the goods.Most technology related documents focus on the low-level gorp that makes up complex solutions, but this book provides information at all levels. The focus of the information is made clear through the use of real-world examples, and research that must have taken years to assemble. As well, there are mathematical formulas that help one determine how outages can effect a global enterprise or even a small business.The authors even had the forethought to end the book with a look into future technologies that may solve some of the more complex issues that elude even the most expert of solution architects."
4,Dark Gold,"Yet another amazing , Hot , and Sexy book.I started reading the entire Series by accidnetly starting with Dark Symphony ...I have not ordered and read the entire Dark Series( in under 2 weeks) ...and Dark Gold was certainly not a disappointment , You can't get enough !!"
3,"Still interesting, but lacking","I agree with some of the other reviewers in saying that the book was good when there was conflict with the vampire in the beginning, but then it quickly died down. I'm a bit sick of all the ""I just want my freedom and why can't you let me do what I want to do"" ""I can't cuz I'm overprotective"" that's been going on in the books. There needs to be more diverse storytelling. Why can't there be a capable woman who doesn't have to be tiny that can actually equal her lifemate?"
3,Hopefully,"I hope all of the women in this series are not like this woman. She is seriously making me crazy. Whining for 6 full chapters so far. So weak and idiotic. She just cant seem to get a grip. I certainly hope the rest are stronger. Please tell me this is not a common theme throughout. I really like the carpathians, the female in this book is absolutely intolerable.Fingers crossed...hoping....."
3,third in the series,"I believe Feehan was one of the first to seriously cover the whole vampire romance genre and was a very unique read at the time. In retrospect, I find her phrasing rather over dramatic --- even for a supernatural romance novel --- and hasn't stood the test of time for me to remain a favorite.The first four in the series were the probably the best."
2,same old same old,"i think this might have been a decent book if i hadn't read other 'dark' books. you might also like it if you enjoy stories about vampires. the rest of my review is pretty harsh, but it is more a dissatisfaction with the series than this individual book. to be honest i couldn't even finish the book. if you like the other books in this series, you might like this one, unless you are tired of the same plot. carpathian turns a woman without her consent or against her wishes, and then the male proceeds to take over her life and basically order her around, while the woman turns her life upside down to accomodate the male. quite frankly, i enjoyed the first few books in this series that i read, but by now i am tired of reading the same story with the names changed."
4,"One of the better ""Dark"" books","""Dark Gold"" was a much better novel than I had expected after reading the reviews. ""Dark Gold"" is one of the better ""Dark"" books. The hero actually had a distinct personality - not the usual cookie-cutter alpha-male Carpathian."
5,Amazing Sci-fi book,"If you like vampires and romance you will love this book which is soully dedicated to the topic of vampires and their hunters. This book is based on the life of a woman who has raised her little brother by herself and then meets with destiny in the way of Aidan Savage, vampire hunter. He helps her through the transition into his world and she shows him that there can be hope. This is an amazing book and a must have for paranormal romance readers everywhere."
4,Dark Gold,As always another great read. Aidan and Alexanderia are some of my favorite characters and I know them all well.
2,The anthology part is ok,"While the text provides some good excepts from Christian thinkers, the explanations of their lives and influences is poorly written."
1,Neopets failed,I am sorry to say that this game failed even though it looks cool it is relly not.Here are some reasons not to buy it.1.It freezes every 15 minuits2.The controuls or tarbile.3.loading takes about 10 minuits or 5 minuits less.4.The game has lots of puzzles and not a alot of fighting5.The e10+ rating is a lie this should be E.I have been a fan of neopets for a long time but did not like the game.Find another game or go to thare website.
4,What a BLAST!,"So many cool characters to meet, places to go, and enemies to fight. And just when I think I'm finished, there's a whole new place to explore.Sometimes the camera gets stuck, but it doesnt bother me too much."
2,poor perforation,"The paper quality is fine, but the pages don't rip out easily and cleanly which makes it a poor choice, in my view. Who want to end up with ragged paper when they remove a sheet?"
3,Great...for a while...,"When I first bought this player, it worked wonderfully. However, as many other people have found, it started popping oopen by itself after a few months. I just put something on top to keep it closed.Also, it seems as though it has trouble reading disks when changing over from NTSC to PAL. Sometimes it takes a while for it to work.Some minor plusses: it does play any format and region. I have had absolutely no trouble with VCDs and SVCDs, which I constantly make.This would be an excellent player if it would just stay totally fixed."
1,inaccurate scale!,"This scale was a major disappointment. I was excited to order this scale, especially being a Weight Watchers member-- hoping to watch my progress at home.First, the scale weighed me fairly accurately when i stepped on it for the first time (it was around +0.5lbs). I stepped on a second time and it weighed me +2lbs. I stepped on a third time, it then read +4lbs! And yes, a fourth time showed my weight +8.5lbs!! All 4 weigh ins were done in the same half hour, with no food or drink to vary my weight.I then asked my husband to step on the scale and weigh himself-- and it sent up a ""error"" screen every single time he attempted to weigh himself. He weighs around 275lb, and has weighed that consistently for a number of years. I was VERY disappointed because this scale was supposed to be able to weigh up to 330lbs-- hence, why i got it!Thankfully, Amazon excepted my return easily... but it is making me think twice about ordering a weight watchers scale."
1,okay.,"This creme has a nice smell, but it would be nice if it were more waxy. I find when it's in my hair, it takes my hair a long time to dry and kind of just smears around my little flyaways."
3,"Great Surrounds, Too much animal noises","The rain/thunderstorm sounds are great as well as the use of the surrounds, but most of these tracks have too many animal noises for my taste. I'd rather have just the rain/thunder. I knew this before purchasing thanks to other reviews, and I am still glad I made the purchase."
3,Loud dripping sounds ruined it for me........,"This thunderstorm CD was just okay - if I had the option, I would give it 2.5 stars instead of 3.For whatever reason, the author chose to put a continuous dripping noise over the sounds of rain and thunder. I'm talking about the kind of dripping that keeps you up at night, such as from a drippy faucet. And it's not subtle - it's front and center, as if the microphone is right next to the dripping. Apparently, it was an attempt at a ""babbling brooke"" effect, but it didn't work - it's just annoying. For me, it was distracting and detracted from the sounds of rain and thunder.Personally, I also don't like the sounds of chirping and squawking birds, etc, on thunderstorm CDs, but I know many people do like that, and perhaps it was sort of the theme of this one, so I can't take points off for that.If you're just looking for the sounds of just a thunderstorm - ie. the sound of thunder and rain falling on trees and/or pavement, look elsewhere."
4,"Good size, but it's starting to rust","I like the size of this tool for my particular application, but it is starting to rust after only 6 weeks."
5,Forever relevant,"When, a few years ago, I became aware of the terrorist network of Bin Laden I could not help but think back to this excellent, concise book by Eric Hoffer.It was written in 1951 and I first read it sometime in the early 70s. Hoffer is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest observers of the human condition ever. All his works are short, concise, with no wasted words or hyperbole.After the attack of September 11 and all of the pundits attempting to tell us why, I kept thinking, ""they are missing the real story"". Upon rereading ""True Believer"" this weekend I was reminded of how right he has it. By delving into the history of civilization's upheavals he explains how and why we continue to see this phenomenon and how it may play out."
4,Goundwork for Memetics,"The sorts of ideas Hoffer discusses are exactly what the newly popular study of ""Memes"" is about. Thought Contagion - how mass movements spread and the taxonomy of people who help them along. His style is a bit more concise and quotable than most of the current crop - he uses no jargon. His concern is less with the spreading mechanism in recipients than with the people who originate and manipulate mass movements."
4,Late 1950s LeGrand...HOT!,"The ""editorial review"" shown above is inexplicably mismatched and half of it has nothing to do with ""LeGrand Jazz""! The first ""listener review"" is the correct one. This classic session is from circa1958--not the generation afterward. Very swinging; inspired arranging. The finest jazz musicians on the scene (in a significant year for memorable jazz records)--you'll hear them on this session! Michel from early in his career. Short tracks are the only drawback; musically, it wails. This music was first released on vinyl LP, long before the digital era. That may explain the typically brief length of the pieces."
5,Disney Winnie the Pooh CD Storybook,This product was as advertised: book and CD. This order arrived in a timely manner. Beware of other companies who send the book but not the CD.
5,Great Read,"I bought this book for a class and was surprised at how engaging it is. This book is very well written and informative, and gave me a great general knowledge of Russia leading up to the Great War. The bibliography is extensive and very useful for anyone researching Russia in this era. Highly recommended."
4,Boyfriend Request,"I know it's silly, but my boyfriends works as email support for a large firm and his wrists were aching the first weeks. After visiting 3 electronics store he picked this one as the most natural feel to select items, but better than other as prevents wrist ache. I bought it on sale at a retailer for a couple more dollars, but I wish I had looked here months ago!"
5,Great Mouse,"I think it's great. I shopped around for a bit for a $35ish mouse WITH a cord. I found this one and got it b/c another review said it had a better feel compared to the Microsoft competitor. Useful software (Mac OS X).The only downside is a personal one... I actually like the good ol' red optical light type of mouses -- the laser, I suppose, makes this mouse super sensitive. So much so that when I tried to use it on something like a fuzzy surface (carpet, the car upholstery lid in the hatch of the VW Golf), the mouse has a hard time ""focusing"" in on smaller targets. It seemed like I never had that issue with the older style mice but... I didn't really find many of these around.It's cool though. I like this one a lot."
5,Name-brand cable at a great price,I bought a few of these to connect my router to a box with outlets for all of the CAT-5 cables in my house. They're good quality and I've had no trouble with them.Why pay $15 or more for these at a store when you can get the same quality for much less?
2,Product not as displayed,"I have an extensive home network, and every now and then I have to replace cables, usually because the little lock-tab on the connector has broken off or doesn't lock properly any more. The primary cause of the tabs breaking is them getting caught on something as I'm trying to pull them out from behind a desk. Having a feature that protects the tab from that abuse is important to me, and was a primary requirement in my selection. The image for this product shows side guard protectors for the tab, but the product itself has no such protectors.I'm rating this a 2 because they are still useful as cables, even though the lack of tab protection limits their lifespan."
2,"An Important Topic, but there's not much real dialogue here","This is an extremely important topic, and it is interesting (even intriguing) to read Sanders' and Fackre's atypical views on this subject. However, Nash does not make a positive case -- WHICH IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Both Fackre and Sanders readily express their frustration with it, which can only lead the reader to exasperation. If you want to engage this issue, check this book out only for its bibliography. You also may want to read Fackre's argument as it is intriguing and well-written -- you'll never read First Peter again quite the same way..."
1,What the #@$%!!!,This band has took a turn for the worst.I'll stick with their first three releases other than that this bands had it! Goodbye!
5,I bought this for my son.,I bought this for my son who has a sensory processing disorder. It is so beautiful I put it on my ipod also. The music is so relaxing and soothing..
4,Fun To Display,"I Knew When I Bought This Sword I Was Buying A Novelty. This Is Just What It Is. It Stands Leaning Against A Wall For Conversation Fun. It Is Way To Long And HEAVY, To Even Be Remotely Considered As A Weapon To Be Used In A Defensive Scenario. Granted, It Could Cause Damage If Thrusted Or Swung At Someone...But I Would Not Advise Grabbing This In A Situation. You Would Do Better With A Pocket Knife...Tactically Speaking Of Course. So When I Read Some Comments/Reviews About How ""Its Not Real"" Or Blah Blah Blah...I Have To Laugh. So, If You Want A Novelty To Compliment Your More Serious Katanas, Go Ahead...Buy It, Its a Fun Sword To Get A Kick Out Of. Every Time I Look Across The Room At This Monster Leaning Against The Wall I Smile And Shake My Head. Silly....But Fun. For A Functional Katana...United Black Series. Affordable...And VERY Functional."
1,Tastes terrible!,"I purchased it to make iced tamarind beverages which my friends & family like but I got tired of peeling & seeding fresh tamarinds, not to mention that it's not always available, so I thought I'd try this. What a mistake! Perhaps it's OK to cook with, IDK, I threw it out."
3,I can't get past the smell,"Does anyone have issues with the FHI Hot Sauce smelling really bad? I've noticed something - when I first squeeze out a dime size portion of the sauce, there is a pleasant flowery scent. However, it's a different story when I rub the product together between my hands to distribute in my hair. There is an overpowering, waxy smell (similar to Cheetos or cheese puffs??) that doesn't go away! I would have to wash my hands and hair twice to get the scent away. I purchased a second bottle just in case my first bottle was defective, but still got the same cheesy smell! I tried to get in contact with FHI about this, but I have yet been able to get through.This product seems to deliver its claim. However, I can't get past that horrible smell."
1,FHI Hot Sauce,"I thought this was a great product when I received a sample with my FHI flatiron. Made my hair shiny and I had several compliments since I started using this product. However, the product I received from Amazon does not appear to be the same product I got with my flat iron. It seems like hand lotion in a bottle. I think it may not be the real product. I will not order items like this again. I wondered how it could have been so cheap."
1,Did Not Get To Try Product,"I don't know if this product is good or bad, as I did not get to try it. The bottle I received had been opened, and was only half full. It was advertised on Amazon as New , but clearly it was not. I was hesitant to use it since it had was opened and half empty.Buyer beware if you are ordering this product from this Seller. What a rip off!! Product may be great, but just did not want to take a chance on using this due to the condition it was in when I received it."
5,Best thriller I've read in years!,"I read this book in manuscript form while working at the publisher's ad agency. Reading manuscripts is often a dreadful task as many novels are poorly written. PURSUIT was a wonderful exception! Whereas most modern thrillers are overwritten (ie: characters with very little bearing on the story get a full page or more of description or there are endless chapters that do nothing to advance the plot) Perry gives us a taut, electric tale of a hunter and his prey that grabs you by the throat from the first page and simply will not let go until the last. Although the styles are quite different, PURSUIT reminded me of the thrill I used to get from reading Ian Fleming's original James Bond novels. Thank you, Mr. Perry, and please bring back Roy Prescott soon!"
3,Not Perry's best effort,"Perry has been a very dependable writer throughout his career but this one is not close to his best efforts. The plotting is, as usual, spectacular, but the characters never work for a few reasons. Varney, the hit man, is a killing machine. He kills everyone, so as a character, he's totally boring. The only conflicts are within his own mind and Perry never really establishes any reason for his makeup. Contrast him with the hit man in The Butcher Boy, Perry's first novel, and it makes for a slow read. Prescott, the tracker, could have been an attractive character a la Jane Whitefield, but while Prescott revels in the chase, he seems remarkedly unable to pull the trigger when he has trapped his quarry. While this might make for increased tension in the novel, the believablility factor goes down to zero.Readers who want the best of Thomas Perry should go back to The Butcher's Boy or his classic, Metzger's Dog, and leave this one on the shelf."
5,Fascinating cat-mouse-cat game.,"Perry never, ever disappoints me. This tale of a hitman and man hunting him becomes circular as each seeks to destroy the other. The book is strung end to end with psychological tension. How can Perry (anyone???) ever have imagined this series of traps and near-captures and hairsbreadth escapes all turning and tumbling as within the same scene the hunter becomes the hunted and then is suddenly the hunter again? Prescott is an amazing character, and though I'd like to think Perry will write more about him I'm still waiting for Chinese Gordon (""Metzger's Dog"") to make a reappearance!A year? Do I really have to wait a year or more for another of Perry's books? C'mon, if the publishers can continue to crank out wordy tomes of unedited mishmash several times yearly from Stephen King, SURELY Perry could be published more often than annually! Of course it can take longer to write good quality material, so I guess I'll have to be patient and wait upon Mr. P."
2,PURSUIT BY PERRY,This is the first book by Tom Perry that I didn't bother to finish. I was really disappointed as I have enjoyed all his previous work. No real plot and shallow characters made me think of a TV movie.
2,Okay,"One of Agatha Christie's worst. Painfully obvious who the killers were, and the middle was repetitive and not very interesting. It beats some other books, though."
1,Disappointing,It took me only 30 minutes to read this short selection of mother-in-law tales of woe. No humor. No solutions. Just a waste of time and money. It went right in the trash. Disappointing.
2,Give or take 3 pounds,I had this scale for about 2 months and threw it away - it would vary as much as 3 pounds from one minute to the next.
2,Disappointing.,"This album's main flaw is that it has no substance. I can understand his genuine effort to make good folk music. However, his songs are just plain bad. Being that I am a musician, I hate to criticize others who have passion, but that is clearly lacking on this album. The guitar work is nothing to brag about, and the vocals are usually annoying. Songs like ""There's a Last Time For Everything"" leave you wondering what you were just listening to, while ""Je T' Adore"" makes you wonder what in tarnation he was thinking. I suppose this album is Bob's attempt at showcasing his hopeless romantic-turned partially gifted storyteller qualities, but it just doesn't work."
