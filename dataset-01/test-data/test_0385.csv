2,Dissapointed,"I am a yoga teacher, and specialize in yoga for breast cancer survivors. I heard of the Lebed Method and thought I could pick up some great tools for teaching. It was very basic, not really what I was expecting for a therapeutic dvd?"
4,Excellent Boots,"It's hard to find flat heeled boots that are comfortable and stylish, but these certainly fit the bill. Great boots, wonderfully comfortable!!"
3,"Look like Uggs, but not Uggs","These boots really look just like Uggs, at a third of the price. However, they do not give the support that Uggs do. They serve more of an asthetic purpose than anything. For the Cleveland weather, if you treat the leather with a protectant, they keep your feet pretty dry. But I love my Uggs, and if you really live in a wintery climate, I suggest you invest in a pair of Uggs when having to truck around in the snow. But considering the price of these, I'm not disappointed."
5,very nice,"i gave them as a gift to my mom on mothers day, she loved them! she had ones before and asked me to give her the bearpaw boots again."
1,Ouch!,"Had to return these. I purchased these for my wife in a size 10, she wears a9 1/2, and they were so tight she immediately sent them back.Wish we could have something positive to say about them, but...not possible."
2,Just OK fo me.,"The boot looks just as it is shown and the fit was true to size. No extra room, so there is no forgiveness. If you really need the next size up, by all means order it. It's a fairly good imitation of the name brand ""U"", however, the suede is not as soft as sheepskin and somehow misses the mark as a result. I did like the non-slip soles, but the thickness tends to weigh down the boot. All in all, the boot is OK, but I sent it back. I will probably keep using the boots I have now and look for a less trendy, classier style next season."
2,Love them BUT,I love my boots but almost returned them for another pair as the stitching on one side of them is not right there is a coupe inches on the side seam that is white and they should be all black. I had already returned a pair of the taller boot as they were to tight around my calves so got the shorter one which I love. I guess I will just try to color in the stitching as I really don't want to return them again and wait for another pair ... even tho I still have not worn them. But I do love them! Thanks
4,"Well plotted, beautifully written procedural/cozy","A fine entry in Ms. Simpson's always-well-written series. The puzzle is carefully crafted and ingenious, with enough red herrings to throw most pursuers off the scent. The characters are pleasantly three-dimensional; Ms. Simpson is a good enough author to realize that, if the reader doesn't care about the characters, there would be no reason care what happens TO them. A thoroughly satisfying book."
4,Once too Often,"I enjoy the story but find the author's use of names distracting, such as Thanet meaning death, and Draco meaning Draconian."
5,Absolutely Adorable!!!,"Dottie fans unite!!! I bought these stickers for my sister's birthday, and this gift received more attention then her new MP3 player!!!!! Whether you are looking to use these items to scrapbook or just to hang on your fridge, this gift is a MUST HAVE!!!"
5,The main text on the subject,If you are reading this review and not by accident you probably should buy this book. Here are the chapters:1) Classic theory of Hilbert Modular Forms2) Same theory but using Adelic ideas3) How to pass from one theory to the other and the advantages of the adelic viewpoint4) Eisenstein series for HMFs5) Theta series for HMFs6) Arithmetic structure theorem and a special values7) Proof of the Arithmetic structure theoremThey material is well done and is designed for self study. There are unfortunately no exercises which is really the book's only large failing. Finally if you find this book interesting do a search of Garrett's website. There is a lot of material there (amazon has a no link rule so I can't link to it).
4,inverter charger,"I put this to use charging an 8D battery on my tugboat because the radars, radios and other stuff was dragging the battery down after a couple of days.... the other two chargers could not keep up. I plugged the bridge computer into the inverter and now have fully charged batteries and never loose computer power on generator switches or when going to shore power. It works great!"
4,TV history puzzle,My family had fun putting this puzzle together. It was fun seeing and talking about all the different TV characters and show as we were working on it.
3,DISAPPOINTED,"YES, I REALLY ENJOYED PUTTING THIS PUZZLE TOGETHER. MY MEMORIES OF ALL OF THE TV PROGRAMS WAS FUN. IN FINISHING THIS PUZZLE IT CAME UP SHORT IN PIECES. WHICH CHANGE MY EXPERIENCE IMMEDIATELY. SAD TO SAY THE PUZZLE WAS RETURN TO AMAZON."
4,Interesting Mix,"Good mix of music, however some real questionable tracks (Ragga Twins). The Jeru tracks are great. Dark Jazz still haunts me till this day.However, this really is not a DJ Cam release. It's him spinning stuff that has influenced his music. But on the other hand, it's good ... real good.You won't be disappointed."
4,The movie,This should have been included in the complete series package. Was dissapointed that I had to purchase this in addition to the series.
1,Sorely dissapointed.,"I just recieved Farscape The Peacekeeper Wars Blu Ray in the mail. I was very excited to recieve it because I had just finished the series. However, the Blu ray that I recieved from Germany, (Which is the one pictured on this page) will not play on any of my equipment. Upset does not describe what I am right now."
5,Farscape,My favorite sci-fi series. Can spend hours watching this - it truelly is far out ! Way ahead of its time and the special affects beats all.
2,the series was much better then the movie,"Movie tried to put too may details in, it did not flow well and was not how I hoped everything would.....HOW COULD YOU KILL D'ARGO!"
4,Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars,"If you have seen the series of Farscape, you know that the last episode was a big cliffhanger causing a lot of frustration with the fans. This movie, Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars tells us what happened after the last episode of the series. It puts an end to the questions that arose after the series ended. Not only does it provide a good ending, but it really plays on the heart strings of the viewer. All in all, this was an amazing movie and I would recommend it to anyone who has been a follower of the Farscape series. My rating out of 10 (0= worst and 10= best), I would have to give this movie a 9. A must see for any Farscape lover."
3,Decent But Flawed Finale,Confusing story line and uncomfortably cute dialogue I can only recommend PK Wars for serious Farscape fans. Since the series was already cancelled I guess they had to wrap this up fast. The fact that I was starved for more Farscape I enjoyed it nonetheless.
3,good overall,good overall. Of couse the series is wonderful. The dvd's are good but the only complaint is that there are no subtitles.
3,given as a gift,Son said it was just OK. Bought the whole series for him. He loaned them to me and I thought they were just OK
2,Book of Reprints,"Be forwarned, this book merely reprint articles from past (and some may say ancient) issues of Model Railroader magazine. An expert model-railroader could probably create some of them, however, for a novice this provides little more than ideas for layouts. Also, many of the plans are for HO and N scale, with very few O scale layouts.Overall, I'd say there are better layout books out there for you to spend your money on."
4,works great but has more chemicals in it than you'd expect,"so yes, it does work great but it is still full of chemicals.I like using more organic/natural products for my hair now."
5,My Favorite Conditioner,I love this conditioner and use it once a week. I apply about a teaspoon at a time and it makes my hair soft and a lot less frizzy. I have been using it for more than a year.
4,Everything I could've hoped for from B.,"I used to talk to B online. We shared the same first name. We both come from cities with seven hills. We both liked wrestling. I used to laugh at his commentaries on MTV and Dawson's Creek. I picked up Seven Hill City expecting something akin to his pop culture musings. While there is the occaisional reference to wresting or video games, B showed himself in a way that I never got to know in our chats on AIM. I wish I hadn't deleted him off my buddy list.There are moments of pure genius in this novel. There are a handful of chapters that I could say are some of the best I've ever read. There is a lot of God talk. Sometimes it is extremely thoughtful, but at times, it can seem a bit heavy handed.There are plenty of huge laughs, and plenty of moments where I just sat in awe of his well crafted prose. I look forward to B's next work, and hopefully he'll be able to work a Mortal Kombat or Kwang joke in there."
2,uncomfortable,This variety is very uncomfortable to wear..they made me sweat and they are very hard feeling. Not natural looking at all.
3,Not Bad but not their best,"This CD was bought mostly for one or two tracks that I was already familiar with, other than that this album doesn't compare to their previous works."
5,play casanets,these instraments were perfect for my neices to play with. age grouping was 13 years old to 7 years old. all four girls had one castanet on their hand! perfect!!
4,Gubertini review,A interesting book: I appreciated above all the classification of puzzles of J.Dagelty & E.Hordern. I should like better that more contributions would have had a bibliography like the Diophantine Recreations of David Singmaster.
2,Not the right book if you're looking for help,"This book provides a lot of information about sex addiction and explaining what it is, but its not very helpful if you're actually struggling with some sort of sexual addiction. Seems that its geared more towards therapist then it is patients. When I tried reading this book I actually just got more depressed as it was just telling me what I was and not how fix what I was. Might do more for you, but that is my take."
5,Another Great one!,"This book helped me to relate better to the individual stories, and to see my problem from a direct view."
3,Out of the Shadows,"The books was good, but lacked real depth. It is repetitive...beating the reader over the head with the same examples. I gave the book a thorough reading, but skimming it will suffice."
2,Knowledge is not enough,"Though this book provides deep insight into the addictive cycle of the sexual addict, the knowledge provided is not, and never will be enough to break the chains of addiction. Christ alone can deliver. What I have read so far spoke to my mind, not my spirit, and it is that spiritual connection with God that I need. I also found that many of the stories actually incited lust within me. They were to illicit and descriptive for me. Which is obviously destructive to my sobriety. I would strongly recommend ""He Restoreth My Soul"", by Donald Hilton. I have read it twice, and it has lifted me up every time I have read the words it contains. Dr. Hilton takes some of Dr. Carnes work and helps you use the knowledge to make the needed spiritual connection with God."
2,not very good,"it is not written in a very informative way, it is not a good book for people with friends who are sex addicts, it does not go into detail of the psycological aspects, or what friends can do to help. It did not explain enough for me to understand, tried to inform by describing cases of real people, but was all just blah blah blah. I wouldnt buy another book from this author. If anyone has read some really informative books on the subject please let me know the names and authors."
4,Quality book to understanding addiction and yourself as an addict,"Overall, this is a quality book that explains sexual addiction and shows sympathy for the addict without ignoring the plight of the victim. The research is scholarly and documented, but the book is accessible for the average person.Although there are parts of the book designed to help sex addicts, it is not primarily a therapy book. It does not contain various exercises to help the addict, instead, it refers addicts to the available 12 step programs, which are invaluable.Its value is helping the sex addict recognize who he is, and that he is not alone in his struggle.I do not agree with all of his assumptions, including that masturbation is morally neutral. Furthermore, some of the descriptions of sexual acts may arouse some addicts, but there may be no way to fully avoid this problem.Take what you like, ignore the rest."
5,Worked out of the box with Red Hat Linux 8.0,"It's always a treat to find a device that works out of the box on my Linux laptop. I plugged in the card, did 'mount -t msdos /dev/hdc1 /mnt/flash' and was in business. This was using Red Hat 8.0."
1,Abysmal performance,"Will list all the files on the inserted media but for most files when I click on them to open or copy, it then says it can't find the file. Happens most with larger files (3 MB or so) but also sometimes with small files. Adapter is completely useless, I can't depend on it working."
2,Rambling in style the content does not deliver on what is a subject of great interest,"This book is not going to be a landmark contribution to effective organisation design. The author only gets 50% of the way to presenting a convincing case, that would be of practical value to the reader.Stan Felstead - Interchange Resources UK."
1,Used filter was given,The filter that i got was used and not new. Since the seal was broken and the case had a lot of scratches and the filter had few.
2,What happened to the REAL Metallica?,"A half way decent song from a not so decent album. The writers have obviouslly turned on their own name, METAL... Too many comparisons have been made to Enter Sandman, another song that will never hold a cndle to Master of Puppets or For Whom the Bell Tolls. a good band selling out for the next generation, which isn't a total loss, just a loss for the older generation who knew of Hetfield and Ulrich when Mustaine still walked amongst them with Cliff Burton or even Ron McGovny. To all who read, before you call Load and Re-Load ""metal"" get a copy of ...Puppets and listen to it straight through and learn why the mighty Ozzy Osbourne even had to say ""those boys were a tough act to fallow""..."
2,2 musicas num single de um cd realmente fraco,"talvez sejam as duas melhores musicas desse cd, mas realmente deixa a desejar, considero um ítem de colecionador somente."
4,An effective up-to-date treatment of the Atlantis legacy.,"Shirley Andrews has produced a very effective survey of the history of Atlantis that is both informative and entertaining. Her technique of relating aspects of the Atlantean civilization to contemporary developments is thought provoking and stimulating and should prove especially profitable for those readers who are newcomers to Atlantean studies, and the inclusion of post-Atlantean civilization may prove refreshingly new to those more acquainted with Atlantis material. The structure of the book is also helpful in providing the reader with easy access to particular areas of consideration, making it unnecessary to search laboriously through the text for scattered references."
2,Psychic Babble,"The author uses little science to support her claims and assertions but ""psychic visions"" from the likes of Edgar Cayce. Though the book is interesting and easy to read, it cannot be taken as a serious work. The author should try to seek scientific facts to back up these psychic claims. If you are looking for a good book that provides scientific evidence for the former existence of Atlantis, don't look here!"
1,Nothing but a new age fantasy,"I made a big mistake when I bought this book. I had hoped for an insightful, archaelogical, historical, and geographical review of the possibility of Atlantis. What I got was a new-age fantasy. ""Evidence"" was nothing more than psychic readings, which were presented as undisputable facts. I should have read the reviews more closely and saved myself ten bucks. I believe there could have been a lost continent of Atlantis. However, I doubt seriously it was the idyllic new-age paradise presented by Ms. Andrews. If you are serious about learning more on Atlantis, don't buy this book. If you want to stroke your new-age psyche and ""discover"" some Atlantean previous life, this book will provide the fodder."
4,Good Stephanie story,"The author does a good job of showing us Stephanie feelings and describing the scenes. A hilarious scene shows how rough it is to babysit even one who is driving you mad, as she can't even stay on the phone the first week she watches both. When she tries to watch them again, we see the typical mess one might expect in an episode, as she takes them to school. This was written roughly late 7th season, BTW, so she's only 12. Given her age, I'd say it's quite realistic."
1,not worth reading,"I was very disappointed by this book. I hoped that it would be something that I could sink my teeth into and enjoy. However, it was somewhat boring in parts and dragged on in the beginning. When she finally ran away, i thought it would get better, and i guess it did for a bit. We met Ironheart who was cool, but Aurore didn't marry him in the end!!!!!!!!!! she had to go marry her cousin who was a jerk to her anyway and then all of a sudden she loves him??!!! meanwhile Ironheart finds some odd girl to marry. It was truly annoying and disappointing.the most annoying part however, was the fact that Aurore was asleep for about two seconds which completly destroys the story of Sleeping Beauty.overall, the disappointments in this book far outweighed the good things."
4,Wonderful retelling,"Dokey's version of Sleeping Beauty takes everything that is familiar about the tale, and adds her own little twists. I love these more mature fairy tales because they are not afraid to go againsat some of the traditional fairy tales and make them brand new. The book was given a four though, due to some editing errors. But they are minor and don't truely detract from the novel. It's a shame that the story wraps up so quickly though, it would have been nicer to go a bit deeper at the end."
4,All fine.,It arrived on time and was fine. It arrived on time and was fine. It arrived on time and was fine.
1,"Great to figures, not so much for faces.","I bought this product with the hope it would allow me to see my baby's face while I was driving. I wanted to know if she was awake, asleep, had gotten sick, etc.Unfortunately, the mirror portion of this devise will not permit viewing in that kind of detail.It is a nice idea, but not great for my intended purpose."
2,This is an exercise workbook,"The description should include "" exercise workbook"" because the 'spiral bound' version is indeed an exercise workbook instead of text."
4,Outstanding,"Most big gamers know that this is a remake of the original Valkyrie Profile for Playstation, but having this in a handheld device just makes the deal that much sweeter. Awesome game, fun times. Definitely a huge change of pace compared to the average ""Slay the evil force, save the world"" kind of RPG."
1,"MORE INFORMATION BEFORE I BUY, PLEASE !","General comment on Jazz Icon jazz DVDs. Why can't Jazz Icon put more information on their jazz DVDs? Like, other artists, tunes, time of recording, etc. Also some comment on the quality of the recording would be nice since live DVDs can vary so much in video quality."
1,returned it,"There is not enough specifications provided, i.e. diameter, etc. It would've saved me the money and hassle of ordering and returning"
2,Mediocre sound and poor quality control,"I got one set of these and had to return them - the center channel stopped working. The next set was dead on arrival. So much for good quality control (something I've heard about other Logitech speakers).The third (and final) set works fine, but I've found these speakers are much better for games than music (and I need something that does both pretty well). They are loud but don't sound very natural, and after a while (listening to music) I get so I just can't stand them anymore.The Creative 5200 looks like it's at a good price here (with a rebate coupon), or maybe the Altec 251's or the new Creative T5400's (though both are at $99, which is too much) ... I can't bring myself to buy the Logitech X-620's (they are way too much like mushrooms)."
4,Great set of speakers,"these are great, this is my first set of computer surround speakers and i have no compliants."
4,A Non Sound Pro Review,"For a normal user who couldnt care less about sound quality, this works. Sound impressive enough. My gripe, why were the stand legs made that way? A little weird steel protrusion does seems a little unfinished. Bulky in a sense once I saw my friend's Altec Lansing. But for this price, I'd better not complain too much."
3,Let the Buyer Beware,"I bought this book expecting to find in its pages an interesting account of the little-known last battles amidst a crumbling Reich. What, in fact, the book really contains is a compilation of several other Osprey Books: Arnhem 1944, Lorraine 1944, and Ardennes 1944. If you have these books already, don't buy this one. If you don't have the three volumes, this is a very nice compendium. Truth in Advertising, please, Osprey."
3,Demasiado Verboso,"Usamos este libro en una clase que tome de ""Historia de Latinoamérica"". Aunque la información que contiene es buena, la manera en la cual está escrita me pareció demasiado verbosa."
4,Good Start to a Series,Necroscope is something that I've always wanted to read. Just the idea of combining Vampires and spies is brilliant. My one complaint is that this book seemed to focus a little too much on the villian of the piece. I geuss the Mr. Lumley has the rest of the books in the series to focus on Harry. All in all I am looking forward to reading more of the Necroscope series.
5,A must for vampire lovers,"This is the first book in the Necroscope series and a must read for all you vampire fans. Lumley definitely has some different ideas on the whole vampire story. If you only read one vampire story this is the one to read. I bet you go out and buy the rest of the series, which you won't be disappointed by. Definitely the ultimate vampire series!"
5,awesome,"Brian Lumley really puts a new twist into the world of vampires. Original,and completly captivating.I could'nt put this one down. As well as being anxious for the next one. I have read the entire series and I highly recommend it to all horror,sci-fi,& fantasy readers"
1,Too much for an old so-so series.,"I read these years ago. I thought I might download them and re-read them. Seriously though, $7.99 for old, ok-at-best books? I wouldn't be interested if I wasn't starved for something to read. $7.99 is ridiculous and just plain greedy. So instead of any money, I give Mr. Lumley and his publisher ""the finger"" and I'll go buy an actual physical copy off E-bay for $2.00."
3,Good printer when it cooperates,"The printer works well when it doesn't lock up our computer and refuse to print. We have Windows XP, and the printer and XP don't seem to like each other - often, we have to restart the computer when trying to print. We have had no issues with sending faxes but haven't tried to receive them. Copy printing works fine, too."
3,mostly fine but doesn't fax,"It prints acceptably fast and the quality is good. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any software glitches (running Windows XP). It can make copies, I use that quite a bit: but the default is to copy in color - output for documents is much better and the speed is faster if you set it to black & white. Paper feeding is reliable and the envelope printing works well - my HP managed to print envelopes only about 50% of the time without jamming.The ink is expensive, quite a rip-off.I never got my unit to fax, I'm not sure what the problem is. Not critical for me, but the fax capability was one reason I bought it."
1,over-priced junk,"This multi-task printer promises to deliver with the best quality. Well, that wasn't the case. My advice is to shop around. To sum it up, this printer is a piece of garbage."
1,I was disappointed with the documentary Edgeplay,"I was disapointed with this documentary about the rock band The Runaways. Joan Jett is missing from the interviews and, if I recall correctly, no explanation of her absence is provided. The documentary is missing Runaway songs (this could be due to copyright laws?)! The documentary also has trite, cheap video effects that became grating after a few minutes of their use (if the storytelling is good all they need to do is point the camera at the interviewee). Incoherent episodes/stories - could be an issue due to poor editing, or the interviewer failed at the interview."
1,i love this book,a few too many(5000+) mistranslated words in the King James version. are we just supposed to ignore this???
1,Tampered with Nutrients,I purchased gallon jugs of all 3 of the General Hydroponics Flora Gro series and finally got around to using it. When I cracked the jugs it was clear they had been opened and poorly sealed shut. I didn't pay much mind and went about using it. To make a long story short the juice has been cut. I ended up testing it and while it did contain some of the nutrients it was supposed to contain it was real weak. This has caused me real trouble and nearly lost my crop of tomatoes. Wish I had of tested as soon as I received the shipment in. This company is on time and have not ever had or heard of trouble with them before but this move here was not a good one on their part.
1,Terrible,"The test material is almost the same you can download from free at the GMAT website, it comes in hard disks, today any computer has the way to download hard disks."
2,Not nearly as difficult as the real test,"This software will help you become familiar with the test, but the questions are much easier. I was scoring in the 95th percentile on the practice tests and only scored in the 84th on the real test. It was quite a shock when I saw the real test questions--math problems that required two equations in the practice tests required three on the real test. This is a good way to get comfortable with the types of questions, but don't let it give you a false sense of confidence."
3,Easier than the real thing,"I studied for the GMAT using this software and the ARCO GMAT study book. I did not find nearly the same types of questions on the real thing (quantitative section) as in the practice software--exponets, geometry, proportions, etc. I wonder if due to the intense studying of their practice software if the ETS folks revamped the GMAT test. It is helpful, but don't bet too much on it. I scored much higher on the practice tests than on the real bugger (taken Jan 2000)."
4,good for guidelines,"like all travel guides, the pricing is always suspect between the writing and publication time. where this guide is good is that it gives off the beaten path as well as the more 'touristy' stops: good for the first time london visitor as well as the person returning for the umpteenth time. like with anything else, know your prices before you go. **credit card companies do not charge the overseas fee - that is often seen on the atm side!*****"
5,The Nativity,"This is a fantastic book for all ages. The illustrations will warm your heart. An up- to- date angel in combat boots, Mary looking as young as she was, and a warm sense of family leaps off the pages. Borrow a child and read this book to them. You'll be a happy person."
5,"Great illustrations, they are so cute!",I liked this book because it shows more of the real way things might have happened. It was a great way to show the Nativity.
5,It rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a fantastic book! It is one of the only books I have ever read that when I went to bed I could not wait to get up in the morning so I could finish it. The book is about four children, two sisters and two brothers. The youngest sister, Lucy finds a wardrobe in the attic of the house that they are visiting. Inside she finds a... Sorry you will have to read it yourself. In my opinion this book is the best fantasy book ever written. Reading this book inspires me to read the rest of the Narnia series. In some ways this book made me appretiate how hard an author works to make the reader happy. This book not only improved my reading skills but it also had a huge affect on me. It really made me think. I highly recommend this book because I think anyone would like it no matter how old you are. If you don't read it, you are missing out on a great book."
1,Toy Stinks!,"The toy has a very strong bad plastic smell. My 9 week old puppy has had the toy for a week. He has not interest in getting close to it. I am sure it is the smell.I moved the toy from the room because it smelled so bad. The strong smell has reduced, but my puppy still has no interest.He does like Hartz Dentist's Best with Dental Shield, which came in a 10 pack of 2"" bones at WalMart. The bones are suppose to reduce tartar by 83%. My puppy does some heavy chewing on the bones.Update 8-6-2009:My dog is now playing a little bit with the toy. I would increase the rating to 2, but I cannot find a way to alter the rating."
5,One of the Best Yiddish Primers,"This is a great book for someone just beginning to learn Yiddish or for those with some familiarity with the language to brush up and add to their knowledge. The book is easy to use and offers a variety of interesting, fun exercises. It uses both Yiddish letters and transliterated English letters. In a disarmingly simple style, using pictures, poems, songs and a range of exercises, you will pick up vocabulary and grammar. Another plus is a short history of the language and an explanation of the various Yiddish language. I've used several introductory Yiddish texts - this one is by far the best."
5,These are the best days of our lives...,"The ataris new cd took a huge step from end is forever. It's cool how Kris's writing style changed a little, and in ""So Long, Astoria"" you can really tell that there is a lot more feeling. I'm not saying that their old stuff isn't bad, i really like it, especially songs like 1-15-96 and your'e boyfriend sucks.. I'm just saying that they did an incredible job at taking the next step. Kris started to write about more serious stuff like in ""The Saddest Song"", about not being in his son's life. After listening to songs like ""my Reply"" and ""The Saddest Song"" you can really tell that this comes strait from Kris's heart, and that he has a really good soul. Take my advice, buy the cd as soon as possible..."
5,go out and buy this now!!,"I got this cd the day it ws released,the ataris have been my favourite band for some time now and i was worried before i got ""so long astoria"" that it would by different and way less punk than their previous albums but im happy to say i wasnt at all disapointed,Its a brilliant album not as much love songs as usual but still its really corny,which is a good thing in this case,the 3 best songs are 'takeoffs and landings'boys of summer'and'so long astoria'."
3,"Good, But not their best...","When I bought this, I was expecting alot from this because hey, it's The ataris. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The songs are alot slower and seem to lack the sound that made me love them. There are a few good songs though like tracks 1-4, and 8-12. A few of the songs are filler, and I don't see a point of re-doing 'I won't spend another night alone' when it was done WAY better the first time. Also, this one is alot more radio friendly than their other cd's. Now I can't even turn on the radio without hearing 'Boys of summer'. It's a good song, but a bit overplayed now. But they didn't really sellout, they just matured...I think I already reviewed this.... ohh well...."
3,Good Job,"So Long Astoria is a great album, but not the group's best. Their songs are as original as ever, but I don't see their personality present in as many as before. ""My Reply"" amd ""The Saddest Song"" are truly the most sincere on the album, while their first single is a little weaker than I would have expected. Hopefully in their next album they swerve away from the New Found Glory/Blink 182 sound and try to be the independent punk band they started out as."
2,"""Rock"" for the radio","I will sheepishly admit that I liked Boys of Summer the first time I heard it on the radio. (of course at that point it was on the headphones that the dentist gave me as they were putting me under to take out my wisdom teeth...) While I will say that this cd was enjoyable to listen to at first, it begins to wear very quickly. It is unimaginative and stereotypical radio fodder.I liked ""I Won't Spend Another Night Alone"" because I found the bridge mildly humorous, but as far as the cd goes, I would suggest buying one of the songs on iTunes and listen to it about 15 times (it will be very similar to owning the cd).Can't say I suggest this one, but its only my opinion, many people seemed to like it."
4,A stepping stone to greatness,"I got this album at 12:05 AM March 4th. And it is the only cd in my cd player. On first listen, this cd doesnt give you much feeling, but after listening to it a few times you warm up to it and begin to have a love and understanding for the lyrics. Its so good and it truly gives you an insite into the life of Kris Roe and the things he feels. This cd is about Kris and his experiences in the band and out. Its personal and wonderful.This cd marks a new day for the ataris, becasue the cd is on columbia, and with their new catchy single ""in this diary"", they should be heating up TRL, and all of the charts. Although End is Forver and Blue skies.....remain my favs, i dont think the ataris could priduce a cd i didnt love. Buy it. You will love it."
1,...horrible,"This CD is definitely by far the worst of all the Ataris'. On the day it was released I went down to the record shop, excited to buy it after seeing them live a month before they were awesome and I couldn't wait to listen to So Long Astoria. It is different from their old stuff...way too whiney and boring. I listened to it once and have not touched it once. It definitely is one of the worst CD's in my collection."
1,So Long Ataris,"I was honestly excited when my girlfriend got me this CD for my birthday. Their record before this was good, but some of the songs had mediocre lyrics. All in all, it's still a good listen. But this CD.......First of all, most of the songs sound like they were trying to write a different version of the song that came before it. Very uncreative. Lyrics? Same thing over and over again. I thought one album about how you wanna go back to high school was enough. Did we really need another? So in conclusion, the Ataris seem to be retrogressing musically - stick with one of their earlier CDs if your gonna get one."
2,What the hell happened?,"The Ataris used to kick ass before this album. I loved all their previous albums. In this album, they weren't as emo (and they are definitely not indie anymore). I don't really love emo that much, but the ataris made it great. This album has some decent tracks. Seriously, I hate 'The Boys of Summer'. It used to be so over-played. If you like that song, LISTEN TO THE ORIGINAL (by The Eagles), it is so much better. Sorry, but this was really not their best album."
1,Ha ! Ha !,I heard of this band few years ago and have to hear this stupid album more than 5 times at work !Gosh I'm so glad I don't have to listen to that crappy band and that abortion of an album ever again.Ha ! Ha ! Laughing so hard that the cd is out of print.Those guys should just do eagles covers and just call it a day.The Ataris will not be missed. Pipebomb !
4,cant stop humming,"the ataris remake of boys of the summer is AH-MAZING. this is a great 'cruising"" cd. get it if u love to chill and vegetate, smoothly."
2,Forgettable rock,"I have mainstream rock taste, and I understand why I'd never heard of this band. They have a decent 'sound', but they lack melody - or something. Maybe they just need another band member to be the 'glue' or to fill what's missing from their songs. They remind of a harder rock version of ""Dashboard Confessionals"" - and, like D.C., they think their words are so great that they don't feel the need to put forth the effort to make the words rhyme."
4,Pretty damn good!,"I really enjoyed listening to this album. I think Kris Roe has done a good job in maturing more and writing more influential songs, with alot of emotion in this album. I really like every song on here, there are little doubts over ""Unopened letter to the world"" though as the lyrics stay the same, and not too much work has been put into it. Radio #2 isn't the best either, although I do like the message in it. Every other song is awesome, and the cover of Don Henley's ""The boys of summer"" is amazing. Better than Don's version. A few of favourites are ""My Reply ""The Saddest Song"" and ""Summer '79"". I'm also glad they done a re-make on ""I won't spend another night alone"" and also a good little ending with an acoustic version of ""The Saddest Song"". Great jobs with this CD boys. BUY IT!"
3,This cd isn't the best...,"Like many happy pop/rock bands (new found glory, starting line, rx bandits, etc.) ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME!!!!!!! The same guy sings, the same guitar gets the leading part, the melodies are frequently repeated. Thank god I didn't buy the cd...i listened to someone else's copy. Some songs are okay like ""In this Diary"" and the last one (#15?) But you basically listen to those songs over and over except with different lyrics and a slightly different melody. These guys are no Taking Back Sunday."
2,too emo,"I hadn't realized the ataris moved to Columbia from kung fu, but they did, and the result is slower songs, and a stupid video on MTV. All of the songs sound more polished, and Kris Roe's voice sounds very produced. Some of the songs are kind of sad in a good way like My Reply and the title track, so long, astoria, but most of the album sounds a little too much like New Found Glory. I don't know if it was the ataris' choice to make this kind of album or a major label trying to come up with another emo rock band. All in all, So Long, Astoria will probably bring more people to the ataris with its slowish emo songs, but I hope the band goes back to their older sound soon."
1,Error,"The game installs, but will not run. The game intro runs and then a prism error occurs. i can't play the game and can't find patches for it that work."
1,lousy quality,i have two of these and the lock falls off and the gasket won't stay on. Its so cheaply made and its very frustrating to always fight with gasket and lock.
2,Rubber gasket falls off constantly,"This is a large and well made canister, and looks great on counter or desk. I purchased it to store loose tobacco in. However, it is almost useless as the rubber gasket came off within 24 hours and no matter how I put it back on, it pops right back off within a short period of time, usually the next time I open the canister, which is every day. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars as it is indeed very attractive and sturdy, but does not keep tobacco or anything else fresh as far as sealing out air if the gasket won't stay on tight."
1,"Vile and not funny, just read the Menendez trial transcripts","Liberally uses the Menendez trial transcripts. Stupid, unsympathetic characters. Warning! Extremely graphic gay sex. Complete waste of our time and money and we didn't share, we actually bought two books."
3,No Big Deal,"Is nice to have handy on spills, but they seemed a little dried out to the touch, like they were sitting around on a shelf for awhile before I received them."
4,Good enough for me !,"I have been working in the service related to mechanics a lot. I really found very wonderful when catching it on net. I think I will do all my best to buy this book via Internet.I'm working as a sales engineer in Surface Mount Technology, doing maintenance and troubleshooting SMT machines of KME (Japan). If I can get it, surely my skills will be leveled up and I will feel more self-confident in my job."
2,Not helpful at all,"Bought these pair of glasses with the hope of finding my lost ball in shorter time, but I was very disappoínted, because they didn't serve the purpose. It's just a waste of money."
3,interesting,"I picked this up at the supermarket for four dollars because it stars Kate Beckinsale before she went Hollywood and the entire cast is English; I have never heard Lewis Carroll's words delivered by native speakers before. I had never been able to enjoy hearing the poems in my American head before so I got what I was looking for with this purchase plus Kate Beckinsale looks lovely, freckly, possibly pregnant and with a strong resemblance to Mrs. Tiger Woods. I recommend this film based on my own expectations."
3,remix,"I got this album for the clean edit, unaware that there was a remix on the cd, but now the remix is the one I listen to the most. it pretty much is a whole new song, the only thing that they carry over from the original is the ""i luv u"" sample. all the verses are different and the beat is excellent (kinda sounds like traditional japanese music)"
3,Too Watered Down For My Son,My child is four and this book was too basic for him. This targeted for maybe 1-3??? For 4 or older might be too simple but if that is how you like to teach your child then you would like this.
3,Not like your original G.I. Joe,"Purchased the Duke Sigma Six Paratrooper for my son for Christmas from Toys R Us for about $25.Pros:Detail of figure and movement is very good with lots of accessories.Parachute connection and quality is very good.Cons: Left arm snapped off at the elbow joint in about ten minutes with ease. (arm joints are very weak cheap plastic)If your child plans to launch the figure into the air to try out the Parachute it had better open, or the figure will probably not handle the impact.Customer Service on Hasbro's website: Don't waste your time. They never did respond to my email except with some automated response that they would be contacting me. Never did.I would not recommend these figures for kids, but only for figure Collectors."
2,Noisy and unreliable,"This keyboard has always been too noisy and the action of the keys is very springy. After six months of ownership, the shift key has failed and it prints a plus/minus character whenever it is pressed. I would not buy this keyboard again."
1,Has serious pairing problems!,"I'm surprised this keyboard has such high reviews. I've owned mine for about 6 months and have had nothing but problems when it comes to it pairing via blutooth with Snow Leopard. Every time I try to use the keyboard after it sitting for more than a few minutes, it has to pair itself again with the computer. This usually consists of a 2-4 minute process which includes turning it off AND taking out the batteries. After you put them back in and turn it on, about 1 minute later, it finally pairs itself. This is just too much to have to deal with. If it weren't for that, I would give it a 4 star rating.UPDATE:This piece of junk keyboard now loses it's blutooth connection on a regular basis at random. Sometimes it requires a reboot in order for it to be recognized again. There's a reason why this keyboard is so cheap! I'm getting another keyboard asap! I've had enough!"
2,key buttons lettering wrong location,esc through F15 keys are to high you can see under key buttons through it ugly looking. Speaker button never work and enter button mark as return backspace mark as delete all keys are mark wrong location confusing.
2,Doesn't fully work under Lion,"They keyboard itself is fine, though not as nice as Apple's. They key issue is that it doesn't work properly under Lion.The keys are softer and the media keys are unlabeled (ie, they don't show pictures for pause/play or mission control). I didn't think the latter would bother me, but it does increase my trial and error when accessing them.The biggest issue is that those keys don't work under Lion. MacAlly's driver is 32 bit, and Lion has moved to 64 bit. As of now MacAlly has not said that it would upgrade the driver. It's kind of a bummer since I bought the keyboard only around 6 months ago. I certainly wouldn't buy it now, given that the media keys don't work."
3,Macally IceKey,"I like this keyboard because it's comfortable for typing, but it has one huge flaw that I've been unhappy about -- I can't change the volume using the keys provided for that purpose. They simply don't work!"
4,"Good, but","the F1, etc. keys don't correlate with the MacBook F1 etc. functionsthe space bar is flimsy."
1,Macally Keyboard purchased (ICEKEY),"Typing on it was fine. However, obviously it needed to be programmed to do several things like controlling sound, etc.I called a friend of mine who has helped many people with their computers over the years.As he checked into what it needed - we found that we needed to spend $50. more forprogramming. He said my old keyboard was superior so I am using it.i don't need more confusion and expense."
2,Good Keyboard - Unless you have OS X Lion,"The keyboard itself is great. However, the volume and eject keys do not work from Lion.[...]I was trying to save some money over the Apple keyboard, guess I learned my lesson."
4,good keyboard,"I haven't had the keyboard very long, but it's easy to use and I have a small desk and it takes up less space than my other keyboard. I am able to type pretty fast and it keeps up, especially on school papers."
3,Larry Williams,"I wanted two songs that were on this cd, ""Boney Maroney"" and ""Short Fat Fannie"". After that, there's not a lot to Larry Williams for me. This fellow was not a megastar with an enormous body of work, nor was he any great influence on rock & roll. The package is fine. The recording quality is fine and allows the original ""sound"" to come through. The bonus cd is a nice little bonus. In all I'm quite satisfied. I filled two small holes in my collection at a reasonable price."
5,It's great,I bought this book because I used to look up my dreams online using this book but then they stopped offering it for free. When I am highly spiritual and I look up my dreams whatever the book said will happen ususally did happen. Buy it!
4,Ultimate Dictionary of Dream Language,"It helps me understand my dreams more, although what they say may happen in the future does not really come true. At least not that I am aware of. But if I have really wierd or freaky dreams it helps me calm down."
1,Never shop here again!!! read before buying,I ordered 2 volumes and only recieved 1. The one volume i recieved had grease all over it. and half of the pages were torn. i will never shop here again. i called customer service to tell them about my situtation and what i can do to get a least the other volume. i could not even make out what the customer rep. was saying to me. i called again and again and still no help just customer reps. with broken english accents. i have yet to been helped. thank you for nothing!!!
3,Large but working,"While the adapter is doing what it supposed to do, it is a really large and bulky power adapter. One of the largest adapters I've seen to date."
5,Great story packed in short format,"I once read that Nora Roberts can do more in a short story format then most can do in long form. Boy were they right! This book is packed with fun, real characters, excitment, action and a very romantic love story between Allison and Jonah. A must read for fans of Nora!"
2,Safety Toe Too Narrow for My Wide Feet,"These Look like they are built well, but I can't wear them. I have wide feet, and the hard safety toe rubs on my big toe and my pinky toe. I can stand wearing them for about an hour, and then they bother me.Consensus? Probably good for narrow footed people, but not for me."
4,Beautiful!!,"I love this bracelet! It matches everything. I have had to replace one of the stones, and also repair the clasp, but its worth it because this bracelet is so beautiful. My jeweler loved it too, said she tried to order the links and they are really expensive individually.."
3,Just So So,I usually love Wah!'s music but this CD is not inspiring. The sound is not well mixed. Perhaps it was recorded live ? Something is off.
5,This isn't a Terminator Timeline Tale,Wonderful introduction to a non-Terminator-type of alternate timeline!!!!!!!!!!!!!A historical role reversal on an unprecedented scale.This is well written and worth every dollar.
3,"Okay, but...","This is a decent bike. I haven't any problems with over-all durability yet although, the pedals that come with this bike are very cheap soft plastic and they ripped before a week of riding was out. If you get this bike and you're not a 100 lb. (or less) child then I recommend buying some decent pedals for this. Also, gloves are practically essential for this bike, as the grips/nubs on it, will create a rather painful rash/indentation on your hands if you ride it longer than half an hour vigorously."
5,coloradopastor,"Nobody can turn a phrase or dust off an old word or concept the way Buechner does. Time and again, the reader will find themselves smiling and saying, ""I never thought of it that way before!"" My original copy is well-worn and I have given this book to more people than I can count. This is Buechner at his best- and that's saying something."
5,Its a dictionary of thought!,"The best way to describe Frederick Buechner's Wishful Thinking is to say that it is a dictionary of thought. The book can be read through from cover to cover but this reader thinks the best way to read the book is to randomly open the pages and start reading. It begins with Abraham and immediately takes you to a discourse on Faith beginning on page 29. The book ends with Zacchaeus. In the author's own words ""The fact that his name begins with Z is only one reason why Zacchaeus makes a good place to stop."" This book is full of wisdom and has application in all of our lives."
1,Dry and narrow documentary,"Saw clips from the dramatized sections of this video (a set of music videos called ""The Story"" was created with the clips from this documentary). Wanted to hear the dialogue and searched for the full version as the acting and production was very impressive (if you like silent movies). The documentary was dry and contained too much speculation (to be 'fair'?) There were a few decent speakers (small percentage). The dramatized parts are inaudible (spoken over). They may have been in Arabic or another language. They are truly the stars of this video even if there is no sound. If this video is all there is for these dramatized scenes, it was very disappointing. I tossed it. To see the music videos go to Godtube.com and the best ones are ""Alive,"" ""Empty,"" and ""When Love Sees You,"" all done by major Christian artists."
5,Marriage healer,"A great little book for helping people to work on their marriages via the spiritual approach. A quick read, but most helpful."
4,A Good and Convicting Book on a Man's Prayer Life,"My wife suckered me into reading this book just before we got married. But, I'm so glad it was on my so-called, ""Required Reading"" List. It has really changed the way I approach my prayer, specifically for my wife.I can't say that I've suddenly become a prayer warrior, because I haven't. But, one thing that has struck me is that when I pray, I tend to love and value my wife so much more. The big thing from this book that struck me was that God won't answer any of my prayers if I'm not loving my wife the way I'm supposed to.I would encourage husbands or future husbands or potential husbands to read this book. It's short, easy to read, and it will help you on the journey to becoming a solid man of God.And men, we need all the help we can get!"
4,Excellent CD+DVD!!!,"The DVD has everything that happened at the concert and then some... Although the CD should had included ""Mas Y Mas"" among others, the concert footage in the DVD was faithfull to the our experience there. Even the songs that were not included in the concert footage proper, were included as extras (even the ""California"" duet""). A must buy for Draco's fans."
3,Billie Ray Martin - Running Around Town,"BT gave Billie Ray Martin a helping hand with RUNNING AROUND TOWN, and his fingerprints are all over this track: the progressive house with trance tendencies. To my ears, it doesn't quite jibe well with Billie Ray's expressive (but with a slight lean towards drama queen) lyrics. BT's ""Jacob's Ladder"" mix indulges more of the progressive house side, but his ""Shelter Mix,"" with its cleaner, deeper sound, is the more interesting mix. Junior Vasquez turns in another yawn-worthy tribal-house mix, but the Brothers in Rhythm's take on YOUR LOVING ARMS redeems the single admirably -- but it's a difficult song to ruin. Thankfully, the Brothers treat it like the classic that it is."
3,Not strong enough for my dogs.,"I am not sure why we've had such issues with this tie out stake. It is advertised to be used for large dogs. Our 150lb. English Mastiff pulls this out of the ground without any kind of effort. Our 60lb. retriever can move it, but not actually pull it out. Unfortunately, the one Wal-mart sells (the spiral one) is the only one that actually works, so we'll be buying it again, and sticking this one in the shed for back-up."
1,I couldn't hear a thing.,I purchased this as a gift and was so excited when it arrived that I had to try it out and I'm glad I did because it didn't work. You can't hear anything through it. I was very disappointed and returned it.
4,Good quality for the price,My wife is a veterinary technician and bought this stethoscope as a cheaper alternative to the Littman. She loves the bright pink color and it works great in Small Animal medicine. The sound quality is great and it feels really light. Overall a great buy.
2,You get what you pay for,"I was told that the cheaper the stethoscope the harder it is to hear. I truly believe this with this product. It is a good choice for your first stethoscope, but not a long term choice."
4,Go Go Power Wheels!,"My daughter Loves her new power wheel! She says, ""Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya"" when she rides!"
1,WARNING NOT RETURNABLE,"This toy battery does not fit all Fisher Price riding toys even if the picture looks like it is exactly the same. Verify the battery amps NOT just volts by calling the Fisher Price toll free telephone number. Fisher Price customer service representive will be able to assist you with a local purchase option. Amazon will not accept a return if it is incorrect for ""safety reasons"". Verify and re-verify before purchasing."
5,Completely Satisfied,"I received a used Barbie Jazzy Jeep Wrangler (model B2077) from a friend with the intention on giving it to my Granddaughter.The battery was dead, so I purchased this one as a replacement for the original: Super 6 volt 9.5 amp red battery with A-style connector.The original (dead) battery number was 0081-0712 and I was a little concerned after reading some reviews if this was the correct replacement since it had a different number.Turns out that this is the correct one and the numbers are different because it replaces the obsolete original one.I'm very pleased with this purchase and assure anyone that it will work perfectly for the same item that I have mentioned."
4,Fisher Price 6 volt battery,"My grand daughter, age 5, had the previous battery in her FP pickup truck for 3 yers. She has had a ball with that thing. I reciently bought an additional battery and a fast charger so she can go longer. Her attention span is short enough she will not out last 2 batteries.Educationally she has gone from not being able to control the truck at all to driving around like a teenager.This battery is cheap enough to be able to keep her truckin."
2,Disgusted,"I stopped using this review after I got to the science section. I found three very bad errors, all biology related. After that, I figured if they could make that many mistakes in just one section, there were probably a number of others. It looks like they were in a rush to get the thing published and only did a very cursory editing job. It's a good thing I bought another Prep guide when I bought this one. And hey, it gave the biology professors I showed it to a good laugh. I just wish I would have read the other reviews before I spent my money and time on this piece of junk."
4,Probably not going to be a keeper puzzle for me.,"The puzzle is 550 pieces and those pieces fall into five different shapes. The birds were extremely easy to put together, but those pine cones and needles were a real challenge. I ended up having to take a puzzle piece and try it in different places over and over and over because the image on the pieces were so similar in color and design. My wrist actually became sore from doing this.I know of a place which keeps a library of jigsaw puzzles for the residents to work on. Sadly I think this one is going to be given away. Not quite as much fun to work as I had expected."
4,deceptively difficult,"all the pieces were included...the pieces were thick enough but there were 10 dangling chads which had torn off from the bottom of the puzzle pieces... probably because there cutter was at the end of its life cycle and didnt cut completely...this puzzle is not a good step up puzzle from a 300, it has a sky area that is assembled by shape which is ok but the pine trees and pine cones under the birds are so similar that shapes is the best way to go...a hint: after assembling the birds and before sorting the pines by shape... sort out the pine cones from the pines and assemble those first.... then assemble the rest by shape...i deducted a star for the dangling chads and a little bit because it was mildly tedious..."
4,Great with some preparation,"Delivery was on-time and this is a great product and definitely worth the money for its cooling qualities. However - keep in mind that it needs to be prepped for each use (not too much effort, but can't ""just use it"" either). Also - the surface always leaves some slippery residue(even after freezing), but nothing serious."
2,Good product but not magic.,"I was recommended this product based on some outlandish claims from friends regarding its ""never ending"" cooling properties. I have found this to be no better then a frozen head bag. Very good for a day of cooling, and thats about it. Very convenient for placing in freezer. I recommend buying it, but don't buy into the myth that it will work for days, as it will not last more then a day."
3,Um...please turn it off,"You're never going to convince anyone that GBV is cool by showing them this DVD. My friend consideres BeeThou and Alien to be two of the best albums of the nineties but his reaction was ""this sucks can we turn it off?"" And it does kinda suck and it is kinda depressing. But there is no DVD of GBV with close to this many songs. And despite the fact that Pollard treats it as a goof, you're going to want to watch it if you're into GBV. But don't buy it, get it from Netflix or something. Bottom line: if you want to see why Bob broke up the band, watch this DVD. Current GBV is stale. Time to move on. I'm going to put the money i would have spent on this towards Suitcase Two. Or hopefully not if one of my friends gets it for christmas or something."
3,Technical Disappointment For Great Show & Band,"Although this is great companion for GBV fans who didn't get to go the last two shows in Chicago, technically its a big disappointment. As you can tell from the technical aspects section, the DVD is in Full Frame (not Widescreen) and not even mixed in 5:1 surround !!! This is 2005, that's absolutely ridiculous.If you're a big GBV fan, obviously, technical misgivings won't stop you from buying the DVD but maybe next year, the Austin City Limits folks will release a DVD from the gig that GBV did for the TV show. I think that DVD will show the band in its true light and give GBV fans a true keepsake for years to come."
3,Interesting,"It's interesting, and unique. It draws from the popularity of ""The Secret Language of Birthdays"", but not as good. Get the other book. It's more worth it."
1,complain,"dear amazon,at this time march 25 9,0 p.m. I still not receiving the book I have ordered on february and already payed. Could you check where is my stuff and let me know.I appreciate your attention and I wait your answersincerelycesare s ricciardi"
2,Defective,Mine arrived in a timely manner but we were so dissapointed when it skipped. Dianna Rigg is amazing and the show is pure retro but this one missed.
1,Jazz 625 on VHS,"This video includes an awful copy of the rare BBC TV show ""Jazz 625"" recorded on May 12, 1964 with the Cannonball Adderley Sextet. The musicians' faces can barely be made out and the audio sounds like an antique telephone. The song titles are inaccurate. The same material is available in other formats in Europe and Japan with far superior quality. Don't waste your money and time on this one."
5,Good for the MBA class I am taking,"Good book...excellent for the MBA class I am taking.Great price on Amazon, quick delivery."
5,The best book I have ever read.,"A must read for anybody interested in business or strategy, or just a really cool story.It was witty, entertaining and extremely smart.Gave me an excellent perspective of starting and running a start-up."
4,Good advise for start ups,this book contains a good advise and several useful tips if you are an entrepeneur. Reality is better than a novel!!
3,Very Flimsy But Attractive and Useful,"It's a small, very attractive corner shelf, but it's very flimsy and not of high quality. Definitely not sturdy enough to serve as a full fledged bookshelf, or big enough to hold anything that's very heavy. I use it in my bedroom to hold my alarm clock, a few books that I read at night, a lamp, and several other small items, and it works great for that purpose. Also, it is very wobbily on a carpet floor."
2,1 year max,"I've had thismachine for about a year and it's done. I tried changing the cartrigdes, now it gives a message saying check cartriges I've called tech support and they can't tell me anything. The cartriges are expensive too. I do not reccomend."
1,NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED,"The armband itself was not bad, it's just that the logo was NOT the cool logo as seen in the pic. The logo actually just says, ""i-snug"" in a cheap looking print. I was tempted to send it back but decided against. I would have liked to get what was advertised."
5,GREat company,"The earring are wonderful ,all my friends love them i love them ,great quality ,i reccomend this comapny to all"
2,Wrong Description,"This claims to be female speakon to female 1/4 adapter. What I received from UPS is Male speakon to female 1/4.The package also says female, but that's not what I got."
2,Craptastic,"This lens arrived with dust inside the lens housing. Images remain in focus only directly in the center of the shot, blurry around the edges. This lens may be good for home video 'projects' where quality is not an issue."
2,More like what MacGyver wouldn't do!,"First I'll start off by saying I love the show, still watch it and own the DVDs. While reading some of the stories, I could see MacGyver doing, most are garbage. For instace one of the stories involves a tailpip/muffler breaking, and being solved by someone else fixing it. Really I so remember Mac reliing on the kindness of strangers to get him out of a jam. Given most of the stories a writen by pros, they try to come off as being witty and smart where anyone with common sese could pull off what they did with no second thought to it."
2,MacGyver would go on vacation.,"Only about three quarters of the life hacks in this book could really be called MacGyverisms, I'm afraid. Even those seem a little lackluster. There are a disproportionate number of drinking stories, and only a couple of really witty happenings. You're better off borrowing this book from someone else or your local library.Actually, you'd be better off rewatching some old episodes of MacGyver before the show jumped the shark."
1,Horribly Misleading,"This book is a total let-down. The supposed MacGuyverisms are few and far between, and the best ""Stories of Improvised Genius"" just amount to execises in common sense. The author should be ashamed for using such a gimmick for a book of brief, mostly dull anecdotes."
1,Hardly MacGyver,"I was excited by the title, but it didn't deliver. It's a bunch of short stories of people who 'improvised' to make something work. Mostly stories of people who think highly of themselves and make a big deal out of very little. Finding ice chips for your cocktails hardly counts as a MacGyver quality improvisation. A couple of the stories are good, but over all the book is a major let down."
3,Nice book but with some faulty data,"This is the first breed book on the Papillon in a long time, and one of the few to be written by an American author. Dr. Hungerland is an AKC obedience and conformation judge of many years' experience, and she offers excellent advice on how to decide whether the Papillon is the breed for you, and when and how to acquire one. The book's many photographs are another of the volume's strengths, depicting pet Paps as well as show dogs, in a variety of settings. Unfortunately, when she gets to the subject of health problems (relatively few of which exist in this breed), Hungerland produces some seriously flawed (and unsupported) statistics, which give a very misleading picture of the breed. This is the book's only fault, but it is a serious one, and the misinformation certainly warrants retracting. Hopefully future editions will be corrected so that this book can be useful to prospective pet-owners for years to come."
5,Excellent Overview,"Christianity & Western Thought Vol. 1 is an excellent overview of philosophy up to the 1800's.As the title suggests the emphasis is from a Christian perspective, with what the particular person taught,and how his philosophy impacted christianity, good and bad.Its a very easy read considering the topic,as some of the more abstract concepts talked about can be hard to follow,but Brown does a good job overall in explaining them.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about philosophy(like me) and how that philosophy effects their everyday walk with the Lord."
3,Wide is not wide,"I thought these would be cute for summer. Although I ordered wide width, they are not nearly what would be considered wide. Hopefully I can stretch them a bit wearing them around the house with socks."
2,Not as complete as I thought it would be,"This book was not all it was cracked up to be, for me. I expected to be able to write down all the important homeowner information in it, and refer to it for years to come. However, there is space to enter ONE chimney cleaning (a task that should be done annually) and similarly space to put in info for ONE computer, ONE printer, etc. REALLY? In the past 5 years I've owned/purchased 3 printers and 2 computers.While the organization and scope of this book are OK, there's just not enough room or flexibility built into it to make it useful for the many types of homeowners there are out there.I found something called Life.doc at Target and that seems to fit my needs much better. Comes with a disc to print out more/different pages so that you can customize it for your particular needs."
4,"Broly 1, 2 and Bio","I must say that I do not regret purchasing this set, it's very convenient to own all 3 movies on one disc however the only Broly movie that any sort of impression on me was the first one. Broly the Second Coming was mediocre at best, even for a serious Dragon Ball Z fan like me. Bio Broly was alright. However the bottom line is... if you are a fan of the series, or particularly a fan of Broly then you should own this Blu-ray."
4,If i knew...,"not many information about the prices to ship it to my country... i paid almost $100.00 more for that. also when i receive the printer, it was with some parts broken. Any way, the printer is fast and not too loud, also it brings a usb connection wich is very usefull... i would like to know that it comes with ribbon cartridge"
1,This is NOT the correct illustration for the product!,"The camera shown is not a Pentax Optio W30. And the silicone skin on the camera is not the product you should receive.The actual skin does not have the wide, square opening in front. It contours around the lens area, for starters.However, I have heard of more than one instance where buyers were sent the skin in the illustration. Be warned."
2,Ok,"This is to big. way to big. you can not walk around with a cara on your sunglasses. but because the camra works perty good, and the sunglasses are ok without the camra and its cheep, i would kinda recoment it for people because it has a little controler thing. but what you need to relize is you have to hide it in somthing else. like behind a book with small hole, or a news paper or somthin like that. and if you are on a stake out you can put it in a breanch and take a picture from the ground so your safe. so go a head and bye it, you may find it usful but i promis you, you will have to impervise"
2,I cant believe it !,The band overall is O.K . I found the writing to be .... well to be honest ripped from earlier songs when the band used to be S&S ( not bad considering it was from the late eighties - what happened to the rest of the guys I wonder? ).
5,One of my favorite Cds!!!,"Even though Doug is not very well know, this is a great CD!!! I really love it. Every song is very cool and fun to listen to!!!!"
4,5007 Built in TV GUIDE,"This is one of the easier DVD recorders to use through the use of the guider button.Makes beautiful recordings.This unit can be upgraded to to be REGION FREE and Macro free.Has a built in TV guide, no fee.The only negative is customer service,they are slow to get back to you.Records on R+and RW+ discs.Affordable."
4,Christopher Church Mouse,I bought this book for my grandchildren and am delighted with it. It was delivered in a very timely manner and in good condition.
4,Art educators grab it,"If you teach art grades 5-7 this is a video to have. It's a fun, corny, silly, movie about Van Gogh coming back from the dead into the 21st century! I was amazed at how much the kids enjoyed it and really were able to pull on our studies of Van Gogh. I would have it on the shelf for a rainy day. The only negative is that there is one very short scene where there is a nude model in a painting class...it is a quick clip, but you can fast forward through it and the kids will never know. This has to be the only reason it got a PG-13 rating. Preview it first."
1,Awful.,"This movie is absolutely the most awful movie I have ever seen, but the hysterical thing is that we rented it knowing that it would be a complete flop, based on its premise, and the description on the video. It absolutely exceeded our worst expectations, in design, makeup, accents, acting, concept and cinematography.Rent this only if you have a moral or aesthetic imperative, and only if it's in the 10c bin at your local movie store."
2,Limited functionality,"This doesn't seem to be a well designed case for the Canon G7. There is not really any room for the neck strap in the bag but it sort-of extends through holes in the sides so you could have the case on the camera while wearing it around your neck - but then where would you put the bag when you remove it to shoot? The case has openings that would allow rain or dust in. There is no room for accessories except in the little separate case that clips to the main case. It uses magnetic closures which I don't like to have around storage devices like SD cards. I prefer theMountainsmith Focus II Camera Bag (Small, Warm Grey)that fits this camera perfectly with room for accessories and the strap and good closures to protect the camera from weather. [OK I know that SD cards should not be harmed by a magnet - I didn't say they would be. I'm an old guy and I don't like magnets around my valuable digital pictures. I also remember when smoking was not bad for your health...]"
4,good quality and not a bad value,"this seems to be quite nicely made - good materials and well constructed - also it's not a bad value, especially considering that there aren't many (are there any?) competing choices for a compact G7 case. The 'sidecar' battery case is a really questionable feature and I'm pretty sure that it will sit in my desk drawer until future archeologists try to figure out its purpose in the year 10,000."
3,wanted: testosterone!,"The stories in this interlocked collection are all finely wrought, but they fail to reach any conclusions. The protaganist, Peter Sackrider, is indecisive, if not lost. Most of the stories recount various misadventures that befall him. In almost every case he fails to exert himself on those around him. Taken in full, his passivity is almost maddening! Undoubtedly the author meant him to be this way, but a dose of masculinity wouldn't hurt. At times he seems like a genuine wimp. While he is sympathetic and compassionate to those around him, a dose of testosterone wouldn't hurt. But then, he wouldn't be Peter Sackrider. I would have liked to see Dwight Allen explore this and other characters with greater range."
2,many broken cookies,"package arrived quickly and was appreciated.unfortunately upon opening the package found wrapped only in thin plastic bag, nothing to cushion 4 packages of cookies.opening the individual packages i find about half the cookies broken into 3-4 pcs....sad"
5,Shark Night,Its still in good condition and idk care its was the rential version but its still good movie and i love this so much how people said how bad it was
4,Good Movie,I liked it. It was not the best but it was not too gory or perverse which is a plus for me. It kept my attention and would watch again.
1,This movie is terrible!,"They should pay us to watch it. The characters are not likable at all. The story was absolute nonsense. The acting was terrible. This movie does not have one redeeming quality to it, not one!"
2,wake me when its over,Fell asleep about 1/3 through the show and had no desire to see the rest of it. Seems like an over used movie formate. I like this type of movie so I was not happy with how bad it was. Some may like it just not me.
4,"Fun Shark Movie, Hot Girls","This was a fun movie. I was expecting it to suck but I liked the characters and it was pretty scary at some points.I had heard about Sarah Paxton before but never seen her in a movie, she is amazing. I rented her newest movie the Innkeepers based on seeing this just because she is so great.Her legs are so nice.Katherine McPhee also looked hot as hell, I am glad she went back to brunette and put on some weight, she looks so hot like she did when she first came out.I have to say though that the part where the black kid cites ""West Baltimore Rules"" as his reason for walking into the water to take the sharks on in a street fight was funny as hell but made the guy seem really stereotypical. The whole character of Malik came across like a minstrel show to me."
1,This Movie Sucks,"Do not waste your money on this movie, the people who made it didn't waste any money on the budget. If this was a Sy Fy original movie, maybe, but as a theater release, its just bad. The CG is awful and they seem to only use a ""real"" shark ,as in a robo one, for 1, maybe 2 parts of the movie. The ""plot"" is just sad and probably the worst thing at fault here. About why the sharks are there, they say its not salt water and that the sharks being there is impossible, and aside from one small scene, you never really know how they were put there and didn't die.Bottom line is this. This movie makes no sense at all and for all inattentive purposes, shouldn't have been made. Or seen. Stick to movies like Deep Blue Sea and Jaws for your shark fix."
2,90 Minutes of Missed Opportunities,"SHARK NIGHT had everything going for it. Stupid teenagers + an army of hungry sharks + 3D?This should have been campy matinée gold.Instead, it just seemed like 90 minutes of missed opportunities.Instead of reaching to push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating like the screenwriters seemed to consciously forgo scares, laughs or, you know, showing any sharks and focus on the repercussions of a particularly insipid high school romance. Ninety minutes of potential thrills turns into 90 minutes of stifling yawns.Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog"
1,Wrong item,The Kindle version is not the book written by Chomsky who is a linguist not a psychologist. I hope Amazon fix this problem soon.
2,Not my thing...,"I read IEEE and AIAA papers all the time, so I know hard reading when I see it and am capable of handling tough material. I wanted to try something new, but I guess you need to be in the field to have appreciation for the content. To each, their own..."
5,another one for Disney,"lot's of great info from the Disney point of view. It may seem the book only applies to the theme park environment, but it's easy to apply their guidelines to almost any business"
2,A sham!,"I was very annoyed when I received this product. It claims to be made of aluminium but in fact is very poor plastic with a bit of aluminium stuck on the front and back for decoration. THe all-essential hinge is plastic.The description claims that the spring loading keeps the case tightly closed. What it actually does is keep it slightly open.It claims to be half an inch thick but it's more like three quarters of an inch thick, making the Palm in its case a much more bulky item in your pocket...."
4,I no longer carry a wallet,"This thing makes the Palm a complete and useful system. I live in Alaska so don't get a lot of opportunity to shop around for other options, and this looked like it would do the trick as a case. It does protect my Palm, but that's not what's really nicest about it. What's nicest, I discovered, is that my drivers license and credit card fit in the back of the case (with the graffiti quick-reference stickers inside the front flap) and now it's all I carry in my back pocket as a wallet."
2,Hardcase,"This is a nice case to protect your valuable PDA however, it has several flaws which make it difficult to justify.First, the spring on the outside is weak and the plastic piece that houses the spring breaks very easily. It happened to my case as well as my wifes. Secondly, the case makes it very difficult to seat in the cradle for Hot Sincs.I would recommend the titanium case which costs around $100. It is lighter, folds behind the pilot for easier cradle seating and not to mention, more durable."
2,What is the point?,"Why spend an extra hundred dollars to get the palm Vx, which is half the size of palm III, and then add a case which makes it about the same size as the palm III again.This unit looks very protective because of the aluminum finish. However, it is only hardened plastic ... not a great shock protector. In addition, I had trouble getting the catch to stay closed.I got this as a gift, tried it and do not use it because it adds too much additional bulk."
1,maybe to protect from a serious drop,"Without repeating what has been said many times before, the hard case may offer protection in the event the palm V is dropped. However, to protect the screen from scratches, etc., I will stick with the method I used on my palm III - trim a piece of thin clear plastic (like used on an overhead projector) to fit the screen and fit it neatly under the slight overlap around the screen edges."
4,Great Series! Better as tv episodes,"Didn't like as much as tv series, but the Futurama we know and love. This series really needs go back to 30 minutes, I found the movies to be a bit lengthy and drawn out. I didn't find the stories very good but still had the great characters and antics of Futurama.Please buy to show your support so they can get this back on tv."
3,complaints towards price only,"Purchased anyway since lazy and don't expect the price to drop but basically payed $70 for a season, the price went even higher a couple hours later to over 100. Not even the HBO season box sets reach that high"
5,"Perhaps the most ""serious"" SKA album ever","This is a superb album with great musicians and musical ideas. Basically a SKA album with hard core jazz musicians playing great solos (organ, Trombone, Sax) all over the album. My favorite songs are ""Nasty By Nature"", ""Professor Bebop"" and ""Hawaii"" but the whole album is worth having and has nice continuity. Great band, exceptional album."
3,It's just okay for me,"The tobacco scent, to my nose, is the domineering smell of this scent. I personally like the smell of tobacco, but I do wish this cologne had a bit more subtlety and more layers. I wear this sometimes, but I wouldn't rush to buy it again when it's done. It's not as complex a scent as I usually like, and while it smells best after it's settled, to me the scent doesn't ""evolve"" in the way others do after applying them. As a result, the notes of tobacco are a bit much for my personal taste. I also don't find this to be a memorable scent, which I like in a cologne."
5,VERY SURPRISED,I AM VERY SURPRISED THE DIRECTORS CUT VERSION IS NOT OUT IN THE U.S. AS I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA AND I SAW THIS ON THE SHELF AND GRABED IT STRAIGHT AWAY I HAVE HAD THE 131 MINUTE VERSION FOR A LONG TIME AND SAW THIS VERSION WHICH SAID ITS RUNNING TIME IS 180 MINUTES THIS VERSION HAS THE PROLOGUE WHICH EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE YEAR 6000 AND WHY THEY HAVE THE SPACING GUILD AND THE BENIJESERAT SISTERHOOD THEN GOES FORWARD TO THE YEAR 10000 WHERE THE STORY STARTS IT EXPLAINS THE PLOTS IN MORE DETAIL AND THERE IS A LOT OF EXTRA SCENES NOT SEEN IN MY OTHER VERSION
3,"great movie+good dvd,But bad edition","I Feel that even with the time gone by & the tv version out. I believe that with the dvd format they should include more with this edition. The edition is so plain jane goodtimes Home video may as well have bought the licensining rights to DVD. About 5-8 years ago the (David lynch/ A.K.A. Alan smithiee directors version) of dune was released on vhs for THE U.S.A. & a non widescreen VCD version for japan. The directors version is a far superior film, then the 1984 release ""with the liner notes"" that no wonder the film was a box-office dissapointment. WHEN DAVE? WHEN IS it Gon Be YOUR TIME! WHEN? However, The concepts of Mr.Lynch & De Larentis out does even, frank herberts sad But, complete tv version & should be released the way it was intended."
3,"Wow Yet Another Stranglers ""Best Of""","The Stranglers are a great group. One thing that amuses me is the endless supply of ""best of"" releases they have. I was in London in 2006 and in the Tube was an ad for a new Stranglers release. When I researched it, it was for a different best of cd. The band has put out so many good songs that a real best of would need at least 3 cd's to compile, all I've seen are these 1 cd releases so I'd recommend passing and getting their regular releases and just going from there."
3,'02's Return to Neverland was better!!!!,I watched the trailer for this and it looks okay but not as as good as 2002's Return to Neverland I'm a Disney fan and I love disney movies but this one looks kinda corny it may be okay if you were 7 or 6 yrs. old but this looks kind of kiddish!!!
2,Nothing special about it... a waste of time,"For being the sequel to the last movie that Disney himself was involved in, this movie doesn't help itself much. Save for the voices of the actors and the extended color palette (that's what the two stars are for), for the most part the movie is a poor extension of the original without anything to add to it. As a matter of fact, the storyline is very much a refried version of the original: no new villains, no new challenges, still Mowgli confronting his nemesis Shere Khan the tiger, even the monkey scene is refried, but mimicking it with children this time. Not worth renting, much less buying."
2,Utter disappointment,"I like to consider myself one of the ultimate Disney fans, and I thought this movie was just awful. Mowgli was so much more whiney and obnoxious, and Haley Joel Osment did not have the same attitude as the voice in the first one. The tunes are not at all catchy, most of them are just annoying. And, with all due respect to John Goodman, you are not Phil Harris. You can't compare the Baloo in this one to the Baloo in the first. This movie seems like more of a Disney money maker than a real classic. It's especially disappointing after awesome movies like Lilo and Stitch and Treasure Planet."
4,Has an Incredible Amount of Information,"To me, the graphics accompanying the text convey an incredible amount of information. I do not agree that this book doesn't include info about the religious background of these megaliths.If the book has a weakness it is that it focuses on the French sites. The author is a Frenchman and he favors what he knows the most about, I guess. I would say that half of the sites here are French. And there is no mention that I see of Baalbek or a stone circle discovered in the Golan Heights."
5,Wonderful Book,This is a GREAT book got it today and Glad I got this one Can't say enough. Pictures and Pictures lots of pot luck recipes everything looks easy and yummy. I can't wait to make some of these at 384 pages you won't be disappointed lots to pick from. Nice big book if I could give it more stars I would. So glad I got this one. If you like Casseroles this is a must have.
2,Its getting cheesier,"I see a lot of great write ups for 'This Is Everybody Too' - I'm sorry to say that after listening to this twice, I can't help but feel the need to archive this. Maybe its ahead of its time but I certainly bought this for now. Bring back his Essentail (Everbody was fair but not great).........."
3,Great cello performance.,"I have listened to your CD over and over again. It is indeed a wonderful way to relax, HOWEVER as soon as I get into it, the music stops. I would love to see more songs on the CD or a lower price."
5,This was loads of fun whan I was a kid,"I loved this book as a kid. It was a lot of fun to read and the experiments I tried were fun to implement. I even combined a couple of the experiments into a siphon powered water fountain that got me to the science fair finals.As another reviewer noted, the descriptions of the science behind the experiments is brief. A really deep understanding of the principals behind the experiments needs a little reading outside of the book, but it was intended as a teaching aid, not a textbook all by itself. I'm getting a copy to use with my son, largely because I learned so much and had so much fun with it when I was a kid."
4,Muhammad Ali in words and pictures,"So many books have been written on Muhammad Ali; this book is a very good book to read to get an overview of just how GREAT this man is. Concentrating on his athletic achievements in the ring, through quotes from opponents and friends. The book is filled with great pictures. To a novice Ali fan this book is a good tool. It is a quick read. Only one tiny mistake; Floyd Patterson was the "" rabbit."" George Chuvalo was the ""washerwoman."""
3,Take my advice,"When I was looking at the reviews on this page I thought to myself, ""Oh come on they can't be all that bad"". Curious I bought it off the bargin rack and then the adventure began. Unfortunatly this adventure is probably the lamest in the Half-Life universe. Its not that the game is all that made its just that there areA. No new weaponsB. No new bossesBut then agian maybe I was just expecting too much when I bought this game. Trust me this game is bad enough don't waste your time."
2,Sierra should of looked to Neil Manke(they hunger)for ideas,"Blue shift had me very excited, and I couldn't wait to see how they could of made a part 3 any better than opposing force. But I was very disappointed, the game took me about 6 hours to defeat. And there was really nothing exciting at all about it. Even the hazard training course was the same. No new story lines or videos. If it were possible I would of rather had paid my money to Neil Manke, the maker of They Hunger. Blue shift would have made a much better free download expansion. At least they offer a rebate for my old op4 disc, and the new high definition is a good upgrade. I suppose part 4 will be Half-Life Black ops, hopefully with some more story and more game time."
5,Another Classic! HL : Blue Shift comes to town!,"HALF-LIFE: BLUE SHIFTAs security in this top-secret government facility, you must scramble to keep the scientists and yourself alive, as you extinguish the many hostiles attempting to take you out. It's going to be quite a day...Besides getting Blue Shift you also get HL: Opposing Force, and the Half-life High Definition Pack!! The HDP Upgrades all your HL games to now a day graphics! all your Character models,Enemy Models get updated to better and realer looking ones and your firepower also gets updated! Like the old MP5 weapon with Grenade Launcher is now a Assault Rifle with Grenade Launcher! also you Get Opposing Force Capture the Flag and you get the same AWESOME Online Multi-Play you got in the other games...Over all this is one to get! And if you want to see it in action get the Official HL: Blue Shift Trailer at the Sierra Studios its a 17MB Download but well worth the wait for 56k modem users! as for DSL or Cable modem users... YOUR LUCKY! :-)"
1,"Plain and Old, just stinks bad!","I think sierra (the makers of blue shift, along with Valve) have some nerve selling junk like this. This has to be the worst game I ever bought. The 3D engine is old and played out, the graphics stink and are old. NO NEW WEAPONS, nothing is new, its just plain and old. A waste of money and time. But Max Payne it might cost more, but more fun, 3d Realms never lets us down. As for Blue Shift, if you do buy it and have any problems runnig it, dont bother calling tech support, they will just be nasty to you, like they were to me. and if you are offered a rebate offer on the box, good luck trying to get it, they dont honor it."
1,has a trojan virest,"the computer will not let me install it, because it came with a trojin virest? not sure of spelling, but you get the message."
4,a good game,This game is class.you never actually get bored of playing IT. THERE IS LOADS OF WEAPONS TO CHOOSE FROM AND PLENTY OF GAME PLAY.
1,Blue Shift - not worth your money,"Half-Life: Blue Shift lets you play as the obese police officer Barney Calhoun.The first thing that will strike experienced HL players is the fact that BS is extremely short. Having only 20-odd levels, anyone with even a passing interest for first-person shooters will finish it in 3-4 hours. ( I have done it in 2)The game's brevity could be forgiven if it's content was of high quality, but once again, BS's levels and game content are nothing to rave about. Following the same principle that HL popularized of having small level clusters, BS's levels are not given a chance to show their full potential.Most of the levels seemed like a work of amateur designers.You are better off purchasing Counter-Strike and playing that instead of throwing your money away on Blue Shift."
2,Half of Half-Life,"This game is very disappointingly short...there is no excuse to charge $30 for a game I can finish in a night. On the other hand, it's Half-Life and the game was fun to play. Wait for this one to drop in price."
4,More Half-Life w/ a shiny new polish,"Half-Life blueshift, first of all i would like to say that yes, it is more half life fun w/ new gaming experiances. With the HD pack the game looks great. But, there are some things that i was dissapointed in this. First of all, its much to easy, and its incredible short. It took less than 5 hours to beat this.(one night). Is it worth paying around 30? no. I suggest if your a big half-life fan buy it now, unless you can wait for the price to come down at least 10$$. I hope this helped u"
1,Bad experience,The dvd didn't work I have returned the product and still waiting at least for an answer I'm pretty sure I'll lost my money...
3,nice,"it is a nice movie, nothing special. a typical romance teenage movie if you like these kind of movies. I would recommend it if you have no other better choice."
3,an okay movie,this movie was okay. it had a great cast and everything. it just did not have that much comedy in it. i like romantic films but when it is a romantic comedy i want more comedy in it. but everythin else was okay i suposse you could say it was to much of a chick flick for me. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
3,A good read but lacking data,"I quite enjoyed reading this publication; I found it to be informative and well thought out. But the text is very light on hard statistical data, relying more on broad generalisations through creative descriptions with little in the way of hard statistical data. If you are looking to read about the British army in World War II this is the book for you, but if your looking for a book with facts and figures such as notes on equipment, weapons, vehicles, etc - then this is not the book for you."
1,Not the real thing....,"I didn't receive the real Poison perfume. My bottle shape is a bit different, it looks similiar to the picture, but is a different bottle. The front does not say ""Christian Dior"", it just says ""Dior"". The smell is very peppery, not even close to the original sweet fragrant scent. I'd never buy from that company again. I wasn't smart enough to keep all the paperwork and return the stuff, I was so excited to receive it, I just pitched box, receipts and all, unfortunately into a dumpster that was emptied right afterward. So I am stuck with this foul smelling bottle of liquid."
2,Enterprise: the story of the defense of the America's Cup in 1930,"Excellent book for the America's Cup or sailing enthusiast on the first defense of the America's Cup sailed in J Class Yachts by the well known skipper Harold Vanderbilt. Great detail on the actual races against the 3 other potential defenders (Yankee, Whirlwind, and Weetamoe) and the defense against Shamrock V, the last of the Sir Thomas Lipton challenges. You can visualize being on board and seeing the tactics that won or lost each race."
5,A True Classic,"An incredible story, extremely well told. An amazing story of true grit and perseverance. It may not motivate you to climb a mountain, but it sure made me work harder at whatever was before me."
4,"An early ""Day in the Life of""","Many great photos in a book that preceded most of the ""Day in the Life of"" series. My only wish is that perhaps they would have printed fewer images and printed the remaining larger.Great work and concept and execution.Paul"
5,"The ratcheting system makes a world of difference,","Two summers ago I resurfaced my deck and wanted to add a vinyl fence around most of it. The steel fence posts were anchored by four stainless steel lag screws going into a four inch 1/4"" steel plate, then 3' of wood, followed by another four inch steel plate at the bottom.Worst problem encountered (probably guessed by now) was the threads had to be extended on the bolts. There are thirteen sections to the fence and stair rails, well over 130 bolts. I am retired and have osteo arthritis in many joints, wrists and hands included. I found Danaher Tools ""GearWrench"" on the internet, otherwise I would not have attempted it.Nick T."
3,"Love Doris, But Certainly Not This Album","The first half of this album is done with children. I like children. I just don't like not hearing Doris over the kids AND it is obvious that she's ""singing down to them,"" i.e., without the strength, crispness, and phrasing that you'll find in most of her albums. The second half is too religious for my taste, and her renditions are not as good as her Christmas album or other artists' gospel renditions. Furthermore, it's impossible to classify the album for my MP3 player. Of the 17 Doris Day CDs I have, this is my least favorite."
4,Great bike for the price,"All in all, I'm pretty impressed . . . . easy to assemble and very comfortable on the harshest of terrain. Gearshifts and all other moving parts are very smooth. My only complaint is that I broke off a pedal after 4 months of use... I was on a hard trail and I am a big guy, so there was probably an unusually large amount of torque going into it. May want to look into the extra warranty package if you are going to use on hard trails like myself."
2,you get what you paid for,"Overall it is OK. but the transmission may need a lot of adjustment work by a shop.The handle is of low quality, not stable at all."
1,Where is my product!!??,I ordered the product on September 16th and I still don't have it...it's October 4th nowThis is my first time contacting the seller though
3,"Good enough, I guess..","I have it mounted on the wall and it is both a TV and PC monitor for me. It does not pick up broadcast HD and there's nothing specific in the manual about that. So it just might be me, but I don't know how to receive the signal. Also, it either loses touch with the remote a lot or the remote eats up batteries like nobody's business, because it seems all too often the remote doesn't get through to the TV. It works again after I put in new batteries."
3,Do not use with pop-up flash,"Do not use for in-door, when pop-up flash is activated.A shadow will appear on the bottom of the picture."
1,I hate this book,I thought I was some what intelligent. After studying this book I feel like a complete idiot. I think this book gave me syphilis and herpes. Beware this book will give you a STD.
1,Not helpful at all,"A sales rank of #413,547 sounds about right. Apparently word has gotten out about how bad this book is. There are a number of errors and almost no example problems worked in the text as they are all on the password protected ""ThermoNet."" This arrangement makes used books next to worthless. Congratulations Wiley, you figured out how to fix your business model. Now if you could only keep your customers from resenting you . . . ."
5,WOW - No Mental Babble!!,"read this - BUY THIS - back Bonnie Ramthun; she writes a good mystery without stream-of-consciousness writing (aka mental babble) and doesn't use char stupidity as a major plot device, two of the bigger no-nos used by most contemporary mystery authors; and it has a reasonable ending, Aunt Agatha doesn't appear from Boise as the secret killer; we definitely need more authors like this!!"
1,BORING!!!,Please I can't believe all the good reviews for this book. I couldn't even finish it & tried several times. The story & characters are just plain stupid. This has got to be the worst book I've read in a long time. This is the second book I've read by this author & probably my last!!!
5,excellent,"great reference if you are doing work in algebraic representations of geometric structures at the graduate level. There aren't very many exercises, but as a graduate reference text, exercises don't do a whole lot of good. great explanations, and clear proofs."
4,Maharishi,"Ive bought this book some years ago, when i had a steady job and got paid trough a bank account, ive bought many books that i didnt had a chance to read until now that i have more free time.THis is the book im reading now and i find it really inspirational, i used to have preconsived ideas about this kind of stuff and never really took it seriusly, but now i can really relate to all it reads here.I remember i bought this book because david lynch talked about how he now practice the trascendental meditation, he said that before this it was hard to feel inspired without mariguana, now he is all about meditation.Im really enjoying it, and although its a bit techinical its great to read."
2,The more I read it...,"...the less interested I am in it. This might not be a well-rounded review considering that I've only read the first 39 pages and skimmed through the rest. I was really turned off when the author specifically claims that TM cannot be achieved without an instructor (and for a costly price!). Although I did enjoy the discussion of reality of the relative world of the cosmos and the absolute world of being, I can tell that this book is not for most readers, as it can be a bit difficult to follow.I'd recommend reading other philosophical writings that have a higher degree against the test of times, such as the Tao te Ching, rather than this book which seems to be more of a path to a fluky scam rather than to a path of enlightenment. But some people need the approval of an ""expert"" when it comes to their progress in life, so they may be easily fooled by the Transcendental Meditation scheme.In a sentence, this book may be some well-written advice wrapped up in expensive packaging."
5,The only book you should ever read.,"Say you go to a magazine stand and see a free magazine. Most likely after you read it you would throw it away right afterwords. Now imagine that you paid $100 for that magazine. You would probably keep it for a lot longer than the free one, if not forever. The point is, if your willing to change your life, $2500-5000 is a small price to pay for freedom from bodage, and if you pay that much it means something much more than if you got it for free. If your a student and obviously can't afford it, go to davidlynchfoundation.org and apply for a scholarship. TM is the only answer to world peace, make the right choice."
3,OK but should be better,"As others have stated, this part does not fit a 10/22 receiver flush but hangs over the edge a bit. It does work to reverse it and only use 3 screws to hold it down. The question is- why does a part advertised specifically for the 10/22 not really fit one? Also, I found the small Allen screws provided to be slightly soft, too easy to strip if you aren't careful. Mine's going back- I'd rather use the standard, more sturdy base with a high riser added."
2,Ruger 10/22 see through mount,"It looked OK out of the box, but when I installed it and mounted the scope it was quite a bit off the target, which I could not adjust even with my Burris POS offset rings. It also quite narrow - after I switched back to a regular Weaver rail I had to pry the base of the rings with a screwdriver before I could slide them on the rail."
4,It works,"I bought this for the same reason anyone would be interested in it, to be able to use the iron sights with a scope mount. It works, although I will probably swap out the factory bolts (that came with the rifle for its mount) for ones that are flush or countersunk (might take some modification). You can *just barely* see the flip-up irons over them, but it is possible. I think it is a smidge high, but the scope I have for it also has a very short relief, so proper cheek weld is close to impossible (not entirely this mount's fault). Seems solid, sticks out over the receiver a bit, but doesn't cause any issues. Recommended if you want a see through mount for your 10/22."
2,the hatchet murders is cut,the full version of deep red is a masterpiece but the cut edition is just plain boring
5,My favorite,Robert Goulet will always be my favorite singer. None can replace him in my book. He puts so much feeling into his songs.
3,NO LIBRETTO,"If you want to follow the libretto, you have to play these CDs on your computer and follow the libretto on your monitor. Designed for a computer geek, not a music lover."
4,Making Cookies,"I used it for the first time making sugar cookies for Christmas. Once the cloth and pin cover got saturated with flour, it worked beautifully! The cookie batter did not stick to the cloth at all."
4,Nice Pastry Cloth Set,"This is a very nice pastry cloth set for the money. I've used it to make a few pie crusts, and it worked nearly as well as my grandmother's ancient set. I was very happy with this purchase. Nice starter set for anyone looking to get into baking."
5,thesilverpalatecookbook,"This cookbook belongs in every cooks library. The recipies are easy, elegant,and taste terrific.Cooking is a joy when all of the above are combined so attractively."
5,the only cookbook you'll ever need,"If you can't find it in this cookbook or on [...], you don't need to make it. All of my favorite recipes--the ones friends and family beg for--are in this book. Its style is fresh ingredients with sensible, practical instructions: preparations simple enough that you can have a glass of wine and talk to your guests in the last forty minutes as you serve your hellacious dinner. You'll seem like a mircle-worker.This is actually my second copy of the book--I used the other one (paperback) until it fell apart."
2,Had Memorable Kitchen Disaster Making Cassoulet,"So I spent all weekend and $$$ making the Cassoulet from this cookbook.When I got done, my mother-in-law commented that it tasted like ""pablum"". She was being charitable. It was awful.I haven't made too many more recipes from the book - this one was enough to scare me away."
2,Silver Palate cook book,"I found out about this cookbook from a column in the New York Times and decided to try it. According to the NYT column, the recipes are very good, along with being easy and quick to prepare. I have not as yet tried all the recipes, but the ones I have tried are outstanding. I would call the recipes ""sophisticated"" compared to most cookbooks for everyday eating these days. The recipes I have tried have been easy to prepare, and provide delightful and unusual flavors (at least by my experience). I look forward to making more of these recipes and plan to use this book for everyday eating as well as entertaining."
4,Valve not included,"This item does NOT come with the stated included valve. This is a ""trim"" kit only"
3,What else you can think of Jacques Brel?,"The recording is old, but then again it was filmed in the 70's...But the theatrical and drama style is everything Jacques Brel would want it to be.Jacques makes an appearance and make the movie fun. There is not a specifically plot to all that happen, but if you watch each number individually, you can get the theatricality of Brel.The actors are not better than either of Off-Broadway and Stratford, Canada versions. ""Madaleine"" is one of my favorite songs, and they sing it so fast and crazy that I could better understand it...I enjoyed, as I would enjoy Brel in any form and possible way!"
2,A strange film,"I had heard some of Jacques Brel's music before. I worked on stage production of this in Southern Oregon a number of years ago and I had also heard Judy Collins sing a couple of his songs.Not knowing french, I can't say much about the translations. But what they showed along with the songs was at times strange if not down right disturbing. The visuals presented in ""Sons Of"" were not at all what I would have expected. When I had heard Judy Collins sing this with her warmth and sincerity I had pictured something entirely different. I was actually quite glad that the visuals accompanying ""If We Only Have Love"" were relatively simple. That's a song I have always liked and I was delighted not to see it visually interpreted in some bizarre fashion as were some of the other songs.I think had they just shot this as a stage production or as an ""in concert"" format it would have been better."
1,Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris,"This video is an insult to the work of Jacques Brel. The production is a dated and poorly produced representation of his poetry. I would much rather have seen the actual stage performance filmed than the collage of stage and second rate images presented in this DVD. I realize that the production reflects the thinking of the late 1960's and early 1970's of Hair and Godspell and this DVD is simply a reproduction of that period productioin, but as much as I like Brel's work, I doubt I will watch it again."
3,Too sticky,"I love it for it's heaviness. I had so many plans for this 32 oz bottle after reading the great reviews. I wanted to use it in my hair and on my skin. Oh my it's so thick and sticky. I just knew this is what I needed to add to those dry area such as my elbows, knees, and heels. Yes, it works great for those areas only but as an all over moisturizer NO...too sticky. I was hoping this would be my next bath oil...no too thick. I wear my hair natural so I just knew this would be a great moisurizer for my thick mane. Yes, it moisturizes well, but it's so thick to rub in and not to mention the smell is not something you would want to leave on your hair. I'm sorry this is not going to work for me. I will use it for problem areas until it's gone or to use as an hot oil treatment. More than likely won't buy again. I will stick to my Hot Six Oil and it's much cheaper."
3,Not read yet.,Haven't read it yet but I know I am going to like it as it is a similiar topic to other books I have purchased.
5,Great book!,"This book is great. The author has a revelation of what belongs to us as co-heirs of Christ and how to posess that! This book helps build your faith to know that you can get out of debt, have that house, have that promotion, whatever it is that your heart desires!"
4,Authentic I-Roy - Misleading Title - Great booklet.,"First thing - calling this CD ""Black Man Time"" is really a foolish marketing trick because you buy it expecting to hear I-Roy's classic ""Black Man Time"" hit and what you get is some other track by the same name - not the classic. However, the tracks are indeed good and definitely classic I-Roy in nature. The booklet covers a lot of the history and has 6 pages of small print text for those who like to know a little more about I-Roy's history. On the whole a very cool album - missing one star for the CD title trickery. Buy it."
5,Standing Stark,"This is the first time I have seen the classic steps of spiritual process so clearly defined. By sharing her experiences and perceptions of her own journey, Carla gives the essences of signposts that other pilgrims can recognize in their own process and gives a way-showing preview for initiates to the spiritual path."
2,Yurgh!,"Tried the ""American Idol"" edition with printed ""Idol"" facts that one is apparently expected to know to function in the United States of Short Attention Span. Does not help that this flavor tastes almost exactly like candy. I thought ""blue raspberry"" went out with the 90s."
3,Medium Quality Game,"This game is OK, but it is pretty easy to beat. The computer opponent accepts doubles when the game is almost hopeless for it, making it easy to rack up points in a match. And it plays very conservative on some moves, and then stupidly aggressive on others. With all that said, I still play it and have fun. But I am still looking for a more challenging game, that plays at a very high level."
2,Good implemenation but poor AI,"This is a smart looking backgammon program, but the artificial intelligence is not very good, especially in doubling. It will accept your double sometimes even if you have only two chips left on the first and second columns, while it still has 8 chips left."
4,Excellent,"Most Americans would respond ""Vanessa who?"" to the mention of Vanessa Mae. I very much enjoy both her classical music and her self invented ""Techno Acoustic Fusion"" or Technofusion. I like Subject to Change as much as her other works."
1,Misleading Title,The title implies that there are sections that show HOW to build and Landscpe a pool..There are not. There a ton of beautiful pictures of other people's pools. The book tells you what to tell the person that is building your pool. It is the only book I have ever returned to Amazon.
2,These are not the original artists,Some of their voices sound funny trying to sound like the original singers
5,What a Book!!!!,It took me nearly a year to give in and buy Undressing Mercy and I regret it to this day. That book was wonderful. So purchasing Barenaked Jane I thought this one would be a little more tame.....GUESS AGAIN!! This book is better than Undressing Mercy. I was hooked from the first page and the love scenes are scorching hotttt!!! I could not put this book down. Deanna Lee is officially one of my favorite authors and I will contine to read her material.
1,The most beautiful piece of doo doo you'll ever buy.,"Bought 2 of these tables because I wanted something nicer than your average TV tray (didn't purchase from this seller, but it's past the 90 day ""review by"" time). Nice looking. A bit wobbly at first. In just a couple of weeks, the wobbling got pretty bad and then suddenly - to my shock and dismay - both tables fell apart! We never put anything on them but dinner. The legs (other than where they attach to the table and hinge on the sides) are glued together! Glue! No screws! We glued them back together and for now, they're holding better than when were out of the box. I'm sure we'll eventually have to put a few screws in.Two word review: Pretty. Junk."
4,Erasure's True Experimental Album,"""Erasure"" the album, was pitched and marketed as Erasure's experimental album... but I disagree. I think ""I Say I Say I Say"" wins by a landslide. And it's a good thing. The first song on the album is proof of it. ""Take Me Back"" is a wonderful track that sounds more like it belongs in a Broadway musical than on a pop album. ""So The Story Goes"" sounds more like a gothic church song with a haunting children's choir. ""Always"" (their big hit from the album) experiments with an odd time signature in the chorus that works wonders. This was Clarke and Bell pushing the boundries and trying new things (via Martyn Ware). Although there is one song I can't stand (Man In The Moon), I enjoy the album very much. This is a concept album. It's a ""fantasy"" album where all of the songs are overtly angelic and over-dramatic (just look at the cool cover). I would have given it five stars had it not been for track 3. Sorry."
4,I Say! What a great album!,"This was my first Erasure album which I bought for the songs, ""Always"" and ""Run to the Sun"". At first, there wasn't much more that I liked, but I let it grow on me and now I enjoy every song. In style, it's somewhat mellower overall than ""Chorus"" and a bit more upbeat than their self titled album and not nearly as good as either. ""So the Story Goes"" always seems to come to mind as my favorite from this album. It has an eerie, haunting melody that hints toward the content of their next album. As Erasure goes, I would call this one a middling, but of course as music goes, all Erasure is up there with the best."
5,very cool CD,This CD tutorial was very informative and gave me a great jump start on a pretty complicated program. Thanks for the quick service
4,Beware - Not the 113 decibal model,"Sonic Boom makes two 113 decibel alarm clock with a Bed Shaker (identical looking to this one) but this is not it. I bought this by mistake and I'm very disappointed but it's really my bad. Identical looking with this model, the SB300ss SBD375ss are the ones with a 113 decibel alarm (supposedly louder than a smoke alarm!) The alarm on this clock is _pitiful_. It's softer than a regular alarm clock. The previous reviewer is mistaken in stating that this clock has a loud alarm. He was probably referring to one of the models I've mentioned above. Don't make the mistake I made. I gave it four stars for the bed shaker (pretty powerful!) that I put under my mattress. If this had the loud alarm I thought it had, I would have given it 5 stars. The casing is a bit crude and cheap looking (looks a lot better in the picture.) If you don't want/need the 113 decibel alarm, go with this one. Otherwise get one of the other 2 models with a 113 decibel alarm."
5,It works,"My 16 year old son, who slept through all prior alarm clocks, wakes up with this one. The vibration, sound and blinking display are all very annoying so that he wakes up. It doesn't always get him out of bed but he has not slept through it."
1,Sonic Alarm clock review,I love the sonic alarm clock with bed shaker - it wakes me right up. I am a heavy sleeper but this alarm clock is wonderful.
3,Something was missing,"I am a fan of the Benjamin January series. I think they bring a refreshing perspective to a genre that can get too bogged down in formula. Her descriptions of post-Louisiana Purchase, pre-Civil War New Orleans are vivid without detracting too much from the story at hand.That being said, I didn't enjoy this latest installment as much as I would have thought. I don't know if it was the change of scenery, the marriage of January and Rose, or the fact that they were now wealthy, but something just seemed...off. The storyline seemed forced, the descriptions flat, the characters dull.The book is still good, and worth the read, but anyone expecting the usual caliber of writing from Ms. Hambly will be disappointed, I think."
3,Was happy at first but....,"I bought this from Bass Pro Shop. Paid more than here but, I needed it quick for a bachelor party. Set up and assembly was easy and quick. It was ready to throw in about 15 min. The day I bought it we threw about 600 clays and it worked perfect. Today a bunch of us got together for a day of shooting and half way through problems started. One of the pins that holds the throwing arm on kept working its way out. After looking it over I noticed the hole is getting the pin in is getting wore out already causing the pin to drop and fall out. we threw about 400+ clays today and unless I address the pin issues this thing is done. We will have to put back together about every 20 clays. There is no fun in that. I am going to start looking for a automatic thrower because this one doesn't look like it will hold up much longer."
5,Great product for the money.,"Works without any issues and throws the clays in a nice high arc. Doubles work great if you stack them, don't try by putting them in line as the back one falls out."
4,Truth as she knows it!,"I think people get hung up on Shirley because they do not believe what she is saying. Well, the way I look at it is this way, Shirley is writting the truth as she knows it. As a reader it is our responsabity to find our own truth in the work. The amount of truth may be different for each person.I liked this book for many reasons, the thought of walking 500 miles amazes me.If you decide to read this book just keep your mind open and you can gain so much from it."
3,Interesting,"Shirley did it again as usual. Another book that is spiritually enlightening and challenges the reader discover their purpose in life is ""Faithwalk"" by Bonnie Oliver. Today so many people are looking for so many answers and gaining understanding of the suprenatural is key to that understanding."
2,Tedious and tiresome,"I was looking forward to this book...This book is verylittle about El Camino and very much about Ms. MacLaines' personaloff-road takes on history, sex and sexuality, creation, living concurrent lives, etc...I would not have selected this book had I not thought it was connected with El Camino. Once I got over that it was scarcely Camino, I tried to find something else to like..."
4,A Certain Fall,This is an excellent first novel by the author. It is both thought-provoking and moving. Such a keen insight into the lives of a family caught up in the day-to-day struggles of over coming child abuse and neglect. It is a message of hope and love. I highly recommend it.
5,"Thank You, President Bush",Great!!! This will show what a wonderful President Bush 43 is. He has saved this country from the libs.
3,Boring and totally out of the Bellinian Style,"Mira o Norma and A bello a me ritorna are well sung by two Angels...But the rest was shocking to me. Sutherland makes ""In mia man alfin tu sei"" sounding like her Flower Duet from LAKME... Where is the drama, where is the Interrogation? it sounds like a Love Duet for Heavens Sakes, even a child would have thought she had to add some passion... and Dormono entrambe... was she bored to death while trying to kill her children? ahahahahahaha I had some good laughs with this Norma...This is not Norma! period I dont know if in Canada she sang it better and closer to Bellini but this one sounds as if she was singing Lakme!!! Totally ridicilous perforance of a role... If only she had listened to one Callas recording... even one of Callas' last recordings when Callas had lost her voice she would have learnt to sing a NORMA not a LAKME!!!"
2,"Sutherland, Bellini would be ashamed of you!!!","Sutherland's diction is horrible. Her voice is droopy. Her phrasing is poor. Her drama is nearly non-existent. Her interpolated high notes unfairly hijack this opera from the other singers. Where is Sills' studio ""Norma"" with Shirley Verrett when you need it? I hope EMI releases it on CD very soon.Also, everyone keeps ranting about how Sutherland and Horne sing everything in the original keys. Keep in mind that the tones have gone up one full tone since Bellini's time. So today's key of F has the same tessitura as the key of G in Bellini's time. That means that both Callas and Caballé, singing ""Casta diva"" in today's key of F, are actually singing the aria in its ORIGINAL TESSITURA. This means that Sutherland and Horne are actually singing ABOVE the original keys (tessituras). It is wrong of them to show off like that. Upward transpositions done to show off one's singing technique are just signs of lacking taste."
4,Worth the value,"Item comes in packaging way too large in proportion. That said, the item is quality made and durable. I have only had mine two months and have yet to take it out in the field in harsh weather, so my opinion is limited. It's a no-frills case, so don't expect a lot of bells and whistles."
5,riot,I am trying to find the video that seen on t.v. 4 weeks ago There was video with the devil Onevideo was in hawaii It was a old video that he had on t.v. from years ago It had taken him sometime to do these video That is what I am looking to buyplease e-mail me so i canfind the one that I want it was in 1996 or later with an audience
5,Good to Read Before a Trip to China,"A friend recommended this book to me for introducing me to the history of modern China, as background for my first trip to China. I found it really helpful to get a good introduction to modern Chinese history and culture. As a result, I certainly got more cultural enrichment and insight out of my trip. So I am passing this recommendation along to others. Mao is fascinating and China is a great country to visit."
2,Am I reading the same book?,"I really wanted to like this book, as I love biblical tales, especially from the Old Testament. But I found this book to be dull, dragging. And the error of Isaac dying before Jacob returned to his homeland was a little too blatant, and I couldn't get passed it. Another thing, is even though I think the author did do a good job of giving us a perspective of what it was like to live back then, there were parts that I felt were a little to PC for me. For example when Jacob slaps Leah, and then thinks to himself how much he HATES the custom of hitting women. It just strikes as unnecessary to establish the idea that even though Jacob slaps his wife, he really doesn't like the custom.Another thing about the novel was that I just didn't find it all that gripping. It flowed along fine, but unfortunately it didn't make me want to stay up passed by bed time and continue reading it."
4,A nice rendition of a popular opera,"This recording is well-balanced and the singers are all competent and strong. I can't say that I find it particularly exciting, but it's not one of my favorite operas either, even though I'm quite a Puccini fan. Since the recording is ADD, you won't have quite the feeling of being there that a good DDD recording will provide. But I think it's worth the money to add it to your collection."
5,PRECIOSO !,"Un libro sabio, pero ligero. Líneas que nos vuelven a la vida cuando las personas creemos que ya vamos cuesta abajo: No es verdad, nos dice la autora:Los cuarenta años y algunos más, son la cúspide de la vida, el momento adecuado para ser feliz cuando ya casi tienes o ya posees la corona de gloria que significa haber educado hijos que son gente de provecho, gente feliz, y también es el momento en que puedes dedicarte a ti mismo, a tu pareja y , sobre todo, a disfrutar de LA VIDA ! De repente, la autora tiene unos destellos de gracia que nos tiran de risa...Pero cualquier de nosotros, sea quien sea, cerraráeste libro con una nueva valoración de la segunda mitad de la vida..."
2,Problematic thesis,"This book explains how to choose a law school if you are a feminist who wants to go where no one will challenge your views. Hirshman seems to believe that feminist principles will crumble if exposed to any criticism, so she encourages people to choose schools that have lots of feminists, do not have any conservatives (and preferably not many men), and that will never question feminist beliefs. The problem is, lots of people say that the purpose of law school is to have your ideas challenged, and to face and overcome those challenges. Will Hirshman's approach train feminsists who like law school, but aren't very good lawyers?"
4,Strong and very believable....,This book was very exciting and influential about the lives of SEALS in the Vietnam war. i would recommend to anyone.
2,ok for everyday use,"They are smaller than I expected, but ok for the price. The handle has a tendency to become loose from constant flipping, a riveted handle would be better."
3,Give in to the ultra-sugary pop music!,"Oh, what da hell. Sure, they were basically a rather cynical marketing gimmick, but the thing is, it payed off with idiotically catchy songs. It's hard to believe people can actually compare them to the Beatles, but there's nothing wrong with uber-sweet pop music. The Monkees? ABBA? The Spice Girls? Bring 'em on!"
2,Monkees !!!!!,What do the Monkees and Spice Girls have in common? They are the most overrated musical group of people with minimal musical talent. I don't think that Monkees songs are good. Their musical arrangement is very similar to the Beatles'. (They try to imitate the Beatles from the Beginning.)
2,Dissapointing,"The Monkees singles, were for the most part not very good. Their LP cuts (particuliarly the Nesmith tunes) were often EXCELLENT however. The Monkees anthology is a much better collection, and a fan would be wise to get that and skip this one."
5,Great CD,"I bought this for my sister at Christmas. She said it sounded good and it had a booklet with info on The Monkees. Had all of their hits except one: ""Tapioca Tundra"" (don't remember it)."
3,"Should be called ""Some of The Monkees Greatest Hits""","This isn't really a greatest hits CD,more like a compilation of their singles. A better CD would be ""Then and Now...The Best of The Monkees"" even though it too has D.W Washburn. This is just another quick money job by Rhino. Nice liner notes,though there is nothing new if you bought the reissues of the original nine albums.Two stars for including ""Listen to the Band"" and ""Porpoise Song""."
4,Preuve qu'ils ne sont pas qu'une pale copie des Beatles,"Le groupe les Monkees ont été dans l'histoire de la music, le premier groupe pré-fabriqué. Ils ont été créer pour faire ''concurence'' au Beatles qui était Britannique et eux, qui était Américains. Sur ce disque, on retrouvre les plus grands succès des Monkees, mis en ordre chronologique, de la chanson thème hey, hey we're the monkees jusqu'a la chanson des retrouvailles des Monkees, dans les années 80, avec Heart and Soul. Mme si ils sont un groupe pré-fabriqué, plus le temps passe, plus ils colaborent à leur music en écrivant des paroles, en jouant plus d'instrumentsm et la chanson listen to the band en démontre bien l'évolution (grande orchestration, mélodie entrainante, tout ca écrit et fait par Michael Nesmith, batteur du groupe). Pour ceux qui se demanderait, qu'est-ce que chantent les Monkees?? Et bien, des chansons comme I'm a believer (repris par Smash Mouth), Daydream believer etc."
1,help,so i got this because I have an S series and someone said it works fine. well I cant get it to work for me the icon appears the adaptor fits in but nothing is regestering so if you got this and it works please let me know how. marissa.lelanuja@utah.edu
3,WONDERFUL ITEM,"AFTER READING TWO REVIEWS WHERE THIS ITEM DID NOT WORK OR DID NOT FIT THE PURCHASERS SONY CLIE, I DECIDED TO BUY IT ANYWAY. I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID. IT WORKS FINE! AND IT IS SO NEAT AND CUTE. I RECOMMEND IT TO OWNERS OF THE S SERIES SONY CLIE. AND THAT PRICE IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL FOR THE EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT THAT I RECEIVED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION ARE EASY TO FOLLOW. I RECEIVED THE ITEM A LOT SOONER THAN EXPECTED. OVERALL, I HAD A WONDERFUL BUYING EXPERIENCE."
1,"Princess Vancouver rocks, the rest is Limp","Princess Vancouver is the one exceptional song on this CD. It builds up nicely to some rhythm and power. Another reviewer used the word ""jangly"" in regard to this CD, I'll use it but not as a compliment. The rest of the songs jangle like keys on a chain, making an occasional sound as they move up and down but do not really go anywhere. Ask Us to Dance and Sugar Witch are decent, the rest of this CD is limp, even when the music picks up the vocals (both male and female) are stale."
2,Poor.,"If you pick this up, don't expect any in-depth or informative analysis of Alexander's life, conquests, tactics, motives or personality; expect a Junior High School reading-level synopsis of the route traveled by Alexander's army with brief, sporadic, uncohesive glimpses of major events along the way. The pictures add a bit of life to dehydratated and uninspired prose."
1,Wrong Title and Serious Lapses in Historical Accuracy,"Wood had created serious lapses in historical accuracy. Alexander's journey wasn't from ""Greece to Asia"" as Wood puts it in his title, but from Macedonia to Asia. Non of the ancient historians wrote that the Macedonians left from Greece to counquer the world, but from Pella, Macedonia. It is simply incorrect to call Alexander or his Macedonian army ""Greek"", when the ancient Greek and Roman historians made a clear distinction between the Greek and Macedonian nations. Alexander was known as Macedonian and had never been called ""Greek"", not in one single ancient text, and Wood should have represented him for what he was. Instead he left an inaccurate portrait of the famous conqueror ascribing him a false ethnicity for which he was anyways sharply criticized by Archaeology in 1998."
3,"Better than Maroon, a welcome change, close to their roots","I ordered this before it came out since I've been following BNL since 1993. It's much better than Maroon, but there aren't any stand out tracks on the album. They're all well crafted songs with interesting lyrics, but nothing much new that forwards their craft significantly. It's a fine addition to their discography but it won't make it to the top of my favorites list. The BNL album that has that spot cornered is ""Maybe You Should Drive"" followed closely by ""Gordon"".I'll keep listening to it since some of the songs are striking a chord with me. I'm still listening to it because it's so much better than Maroon."
2,new and not-so-improved.,"i know it would have been next to impossible for BNL to have topped their last cd, ""Maroon"" (which stands as their most brilliant album to date IMO), i guess i was still hoping for a bit more then what is offered here. Overall, the mood is a lot more laid-back and the songs just have far less energy and ""spark"" then i've come to expect from these guys. It's hard to pin-point really. But with few exceptions, there doesn't seem to be very much life in these songs.It gets off to a pretty good start with the first three songs; ""Celebrity"", ""Maybe Katie"" , and ""Another Postcard"". But things go downhill from there. ""Shopping"" is, to be blunt, a terrible song. and while i know i may be setting the bar a bit high, i can't help but wonder how that song could have even made it onto the album?This review will more then likely anger some die-hard BNL fans, but i do consider myself to be one of them, and that's the main reason this album is so disappointing for me."
2,Where's the meat?,"The Barenaked Ladies have become my favorite modern band over the past few years with each cd offering at least three excellent songs and the rest very satisfying. This cd's best tunes are typical of the average BNL cd songs while the harder edge pop/rock hits are absent. Most of the songs here are lightweight offerings...too much cute fun and not enough substance. If you are not an avid BNL fan, don't bother with this cd."
2,Mwhooah,"I am a big fan of the BNL, but I am quite disappointed with this album. All the songs sound about the same and I miss the clever changes of styles that they did on Gorden and Stunt.The music is nice background muzak if you are shopping in a mall but not worthy of BNL. Sorry guys, but you have done far better things than this."
1,poor information,"Got the item but for my surprise, the length is too short for a normal 318 is BMWshould be incorporated the length"
1,The worst software I've ever tried to use,"This software is a bargain at [its price], but you get what you pay for. Upon installation I found that there were several bugs that I had to call tech support about to fix. Once I was able to use the fax aspect of the software, I tried to get the speaker phone to work. I have a voice/fax/data modem, but the only response I could get was that maybe my modem wasn't really a voice modem. The fax software works ok, but is extremely slow. It takes about 15 minutes to send 3 pages. I wish I had never tried this software. This company is famous for the canned answer that the modem is not supported. Spend a little more money and get a better product."
4,Good for the price,"This belt was a good deal for the price. Decent quality for a basic styled ammo belt. I have to type in 20 words for this review to post but really, what more can I say other than it was worth the money spent."
5,great,holds shells tightly. great quality for the price. and fits tight on you without falling down. also got it a day early.
5,"awesome product, awesome price","For 5 dollars, this product is well worth the money. Fairly heavy duty construction, nice nylon belt, and a pretty durable belt buckle. It's adjustable, which is nice. It holds 12 gauge shells securely, so there is not need to worry about them falling out. I am not sure how the 20 gauge shells fit in it."
3,needs one more thing,"I purchased 4 of this product for different gauge shells. Item was well made, only one problem, I have a size 34"" waist that means 20 inches of excess belt just hangs down. If a loop were attached to take up this excess the problem would be eliminated. Cutting the excess material causes fraying and can only be eliminated by epoxy gluing the cut edge. Adding this loop would make it a 5 star product."
2,Quality Control?,"Okay so for a $5 nylon belt I wasn't expecting much, but when it arrived i realized one side of the buckle, the ""positive"" unit, if you will, was broken and it was only hanging on by the 1 other side. So now I feel like it's only a matter of time before the other side of the buckle snaps off. To fix this, I tied a knot in the nylon instead of using the buckle, and now it's pretty much only good to use as an over-the-shoulder bandolier. Not too impressed, but you get what you pay for. Save your money, and just buy a box of buckshot or something."
3,Buying for Halloween? WARNING: NOT AS PICTURED.,"If you own guns and you are shopping for this belt to use real shells, its probably safe to assume you were expecting it to arrive empty. However, I bought this as a Halloween prop, not thinking that it wouldn't include fake shells. DUHHH! My mistake. I feel a little duped by the photo.I can't review this product based on quality or durability, but wanted to help others avoid my mistake. Hence the 3 star review."
5,Simply the best book I've read this year,"I would recommend this book to anyone as an absolute must read. I read it in the original Portuguese at the suggestion of a friend and if you have the ability, I suggest you do the same. The translation simply doesn't portray the magnificence and beauty of Amado's original. After living in Brazil for sometime, this novel is, to me, the most incredible portrayal of these youth and the circumstances in which they live. The book may be 70 years old, but it is certainly as applicable today as anything else I've read."
1,Poor radio reception,We ordered the Cambridge Soundworks 740 CD radio for Christmas after doing considerable research on the internet. The radio would not receive AM stations even after using their provided AM antenna. FM reception was not very good either. We called Soundworks and they said to get an AM amplified antenna and it would work great. Doing that we could get one station 15 miles away almost acceptable. We do live in the country but have never had any problem getting radio stations with our cheap radios and did not dream that an expensive radio would have this type of problem. Soundworks admits that the AM signal is weak. Very poor radio and I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Fantastic Radio,"First I must give praise to Amazon.Com for their great service. I mistakenly ordered the 730 radio thinking that it included a CD player. Customer service corrected my error and I received the correct player 740 CD in just (2) days.This radio is a fantastic! The sound is outstanding, easy to make adjustments to sound quality. I like the Radio Data Service I can check the name of a tune that is being played.The direction's are not the best, but It was easy to figure out.I would have given the 740 CD five star's except for two item's. For me the illuminated numbers are too small to see at night time i.e waking up during the night to check the time and lastly I wish I didn't have to have an antenna setting on top of the radio. However, without it the radio signals are weak I guess it's a matter of your dammed if you do and dammed if you don't.I have no doubts that I will love this radio for a long time.Paul"
1,Good as Bose and cheaper,"I have a Bose Acoustic Wave which I purchased for $500 two years ago and was looking for something of similar quality for a gift but did not want to spend that much this time. I purchased and have listened to the Cambridge Soundworks 740 and it seems to me to be in no way inferior to the Bose and is almost 30% less expensive. It also does not have the disadvantage of being totally without manual controls and operable only with the remote. I do not know how long either will last without problems but based on sound quality, design and price, I recomnend the Cambridge."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"5 Weeks after it arrived it would not relinquish the cd within. The sound quality is not good for classical music. If all you want is base and loud base and little more ( suitable for modern pop ""music"" using the word music loosely) you will like it, if it works.I returned it and bought a Boston Acoustics model instead, which I love."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"This was rather disappointing. The exercises are good- but there's three of them. And no instruction on what Chicken Picking actually is- just, here- learn these three tunes. I wanted an educational experience, not to just learn his tunes."
3,Three pages of transcribed solo and a CD -- not worth the price.,"I gave this book three stars instead of two because the point of this review is not to dissuade anyone from buying this book -- there is definitely something to be learned here. Rather, it is to let prospective buyers know exactly what they are buying.This book includes nine pages of music.Specifically:One page of transcribed solo in A, comprising 16 bars. The second and third pages of the A solo are those same exact (note-for-note) 16 bars again (they are repeated because the 16 bars are separated into four 4-bar segments, which are also separate tracks on the CD), plus the chord progression. The chord progression is fluff, because anyone who can play well enough to play what is in this book can figure out the three chords in a blues progression.The A solo is followed by the same exact thing for the keys of E and D. So this book is literally three unique pages of transcription.It of course includes the CD, as well as a brief bio."
2,Ummmmmmmm...........How to describe this book.,"For all the praise this book has gotten from other reviews, I was really disappointed in the way this book dragged on and on. I bought this book after amazon recommended it and I saw the high praise from other reviewers. I am not saying it is a bad book, but it really drags sometimes. Sabrina and Morgan are both to hung up on the past and all the figthing that has happened with their clans. The whole story hinges on this Eve character, who is the bad person. I had this figured out in the first chapter. I guess if you had to have a long book for a car ride or an airplane ride that this would be for you, but otherwise skip this one."
4,"Very, very good","Susan King is one of my all time favorite writers. I have got to say that Whisper of Roses was almost (not quite) just almost as good as one of Susan King's. I really enjoyed this. I did, however, find myself getting really tired of Sabrina's self-pity role and applauded some of Morgan's reactions to her poor me ways, but all in all I liked this book."
3,"Historically excellent, but","I agree with previous reviews of this book - I found it hard going and only because of Richard, it's main character, did any of the story hold together. The historic details, as is Ms. McCullough's wont, are superbly researched and I have learned a lot because of them, but I was not riveted, which is something I do expect from Ms McCullough.A sequel to this story - I don't think I'll stand in line to buy it."
2,A boring Disapointment,"Morgans Run was a very strange and oddball novel. There were many literal gaps and parts that left you hanging. Although the characters were fun and enjoyable to read about, it was the only thing that made me put any stars on the book. The book seemed to long to read and not worth thee time. But I figured that I'd stick with it and read until the end. After the last page, I wasn't suprised that I was half asleep. If you like fun and exciting books, this, well, is not up your alley. Colleen McCullough has had much better novels."
3,It was ok...,"It was alright. It was pretty slow paced, but the ending was pretty good. An abridged version would've been better... or better yet, read the 1st 50 pages, the last 100 pages, the afterword, and wikipedia Norfolk Island.I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and this book WAS really good in the historical aspect, just not a terribly captivating story. Not a bad story though... I wouldn't NOT recommend it... just not one that will get a re-read :)"
3,Waiting for the story to start,"This novel is well researched and has great value in bringing to life the historical period of forced British colonialism in the 18th century. However, it took half of a very thick book for the hero even to arrive in the Antipodes, and the book had almost reached its conclusion before anything of note really happened in terms of emotional tension.How different from The Thorn Birds where the emotional tension was taut throughout the book.This is an interesting read if you want to learn about the historical era, but I was waiting for the other shoe to drop all the way through. Pity!"
5,Great program,"This is the only program I bought for my Handspring. Worked great when I was an undergrad and had lots of assignments, tests, etc. to keep track of. The interface is good and it certainly did a better job of keeping track of things than I would have on my own."
5,Cartas a la sombra de tu piel,"This collection of poetry explores the essence of love. Every piece of work brings a whole new universe of images to the senses. It has the power to bring the aroma of the Caribbean to the reader's world.The poems in this book range from erotic, sensual love poetry to transcendent reflections. This is a fine collection that I enthusiastically recommend, particularly to those with an interest in Latin-American literature."
4,Great read,I have really enjoyed reading the Bullet Catchers series. This is definitely a good read with really fun characters. The story follows Sage and Bullet Catcher Johnny Christiano. The books is sexy and fun but also has an intriguing plot where females pay to to be kidnapped to fulfill their fantasies. When Sage's roommate commits suicide after a supposed kidnapping she does everything she can to figure out what happened including asking her aunt Lucy for help. While Lucy doesn't help Sage she also doesn't trust that the investigative reporter will let it go so she sends Johnny Christiano to make sure she stays safe only he doesn't know that Sage is Lucy's niece.The plot is pretty solid and Johnny is a very fun Bullet Catcher. You also get glimpses of Lucy and what ehr family means to her as well as hints of her back story which I can't wait to read.
1,This shouldn't even be for sale!,"I think an elementary school student put this DVD together. Boring boring boring. The editing is crap, the games on screen don't correspond to the written scores on screen, the music is bad, etc.. etc.. etc... I bought the whole package toghether (Volumes 1,2,3,4), and I exchanged them all because I thought mine were just messed up. Well, I got the new ones and they were exactly the same. Unfortunately I got them from another vendor which didn't accept returns, just exchanges so I'm stuck with them."
2,"Slow, No Easy Rawlings","Alex Baxter is an aide to Washington, DC's powerful mayor, Simon Blake, andis also his son in law. Alex discovers that Simon in addition to being themayor is also the biggest drug dealer in DC and has implicated Alex and hisfamily in his dealings. Alex, with the help of his friends, securityexpert Lisa, street wise Fortune and computer savvy Foody, attempt to clearAlex's name and bring down Simon.The plot was an interesting concept, but did not seem to deliver on paper.The jacket cover Alex was touted as an Easy Rawlings for the 21st Century,but neither he nor the book were anywhere close to Walter Mosley's fastpaced and smart Easy Rawlings Mystery novels. The book was slow, thewriting was flat, and the characters did not captivate. The book wasshort, but difficult to finish, and is not one that I would recommend.reviewed bymisrich"
3,I just have to say,"I always groaned from seeing Steve Jobs on the cover of this book. It may sell more copies by featuring a trendsetter, but Jobs is no computer scientist. Now Woz, on the other hand..."
5,From the Author,"Develop and implement this attacking system played by top clubs Ajax and Heerenveen and the Dutch National Team, as well as 90% of the youth teams in Holland. This DVD shows how to build this offensive system of play in your team and the adjustments to be made when the opposition has possession through clear diagrams, choreographed sessions and game footage. --Reedswain"
4,3 stars for Minnie Driver; an extra star for Jonathan Rhys Meyers (who improves every film in which he appears)!,"That about says it, actually. I did like the film; Minnie Driver gives a quite good (funny, soulful, intense) performance, as required. But put Jonathan Rhys Meyers in-frame, and *pow!* You've suddenly got magic; a strange-marvelous alchemy of superb acting, intensity, sex, humor, insert-adjective-here. The man astounds, as always."
5,Great film with a great cast!...,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film upon my first viewing, but I was won over instantly by the great story, beautiful photography and the amazing cast. Minnie Driver was perfectly cast in the role of Mary Blackchurch and her performance was most certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination. In fact, I have always felt that Minnie has never really been given the attention she deserves and her talents have been mostly underrated. I would love to see much more of her! The same can be said for Tom Wilkenson, who's acting is always first rate. As for the supporting roles, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was quite excellent in what I believe is one of his earlier roles, and last, but certainly not least, Florence Hoath always delivers a stand out performance. Overall, this film is a wonderful period piece with a great look to it that will pull you in and keep you there until the very end. Beautifully done!"
3,Pretty but overpriced for this lower quality throw,"As another reviewer commented, this throw isn't as vibrant (contrasty) as the photo. It's still pretty to look at but it should have a border. I sent my back because pulling a sticker off (who puts stickers on cotton?) caused threads to unweave! This throw isn't woven tightly to begin with. I envision that after several washes, the edges will be an unraveled mess."
3,"""CHARANGA DE LA 4""- ""RECUERDA A BENY MORE""","Although this was a good effort by ""Guajiro/SAR"" labels to celebrate Beny More and although an all-star recording studio NYC based charanga ensemble was used with luminaries such as Jose Fajardo on flute, Pupi Legarreta on violin,Roberto Torres on chorus,etc.even though the musical arrangement and orchestration are excellent, it is obvious that Beny More's format and style was on ""conjuntos"" or jazz bands, not on charangas, however in spite of that, this album became a best seller in the states, during the 80's and was later released on CD. Perhaps the idea for this project was based on Jose Fajardo's own recording in Cuba in 1959 of a Beny More blockbuster 1952,hit ""Bonito y Sabroso"", which was also a success."
4,Great sound but hard to control,I really like the rover - but the design is a bit too simple. You can not see the song that it is playing. You can not place your songs in a desired order. It is hard to control.
3,An Unfortunate Classic,"The language of the book is unneccessarilly opaque, and in it's attempts to tie the author's descriptive language with the language of current digital technology it is strained and often veers toward inaccuracy in desperation.Ok, I said it. Sorry.That said, the book offers a powerful theory of new media, and introduces a very useful vocabulary.Bleah."
4,Great Compass!,This is a very nice quality compass. It Came quickly and works well in the boat! A Compass cover to protect in the sun is also available.
5,Exhaust Tip,Looks great and it make a sweet sound in my Silverado. The item got here in two days arriving before none on the second day. Great!!!
4,Nice phone,"I purchased this phone in August. It works very well. I just wish that the menus talked. Everything else on the unit talks except the menus. If you wouldn't mind that, then this phone is perfect for you."
4,"Nice phone, though a bit tiny","This phone has all of the features that we needed and works very well. It is nice to have a backlit keypad, though the numbers are a bit small. Actually, overall the phone is pretty small. Fortunately, I'm still relatively young and my eyesight is good. I just think older folks or folks with bifocals would be frustrated by this. Remember to keep it off the charger until the battery is low, though. This will extend the battery life."
3,My take on Névoa,This Album is soooo relaxing though it's in latin I'm sure You'll enjoy this Album no matter waht race or nationality:)
2,NOT SATISFIED!,"I was not happy with this buyer at all. He only gives you seven days to return a product. He does not guarantee the products. The product does not work in all three speeds, only in one and of course i did not find this out right away so my seven days were GONE!!!I would not purchase another thing from this buyer!!!"
4,Beautiful book,"I liked this fresh look challenging girls toward purity. The photography and design is what sold me on it, and it is just a beautiful book, and fun to read. Mrs. Gresh talks straight to you and offers love and encouragement.A good book for all young girls."
2,Sorely Disapointed,"After reading the reviews about this book I was convinced it must be good for teaching purity, I was sorely disappointed. The title does not match the book entirely. It should have been titled ""How to attain purity after you've messed up"". This book may be good for a girl who has already messed up and wants to start over. I would not recommend this book for someone who wishes to start out and remain pure. This book is also for a more mature reader. If you are looking for something for a young girl learning about purity, this is not the book for you."
1,Don't buy this drive,"If there were a 0 start rating I would give it to the is product. I had two older versions of the same and had absolutely no problems. I bought the new one and the manufacture changed the drive. It is smaller, runs hotter, and crashes more often than windows. Don't buy this drive."
1,missing in actin,This book was order dec 13 and still has not arrived at a US address 7 weeks later????? Is there a problem sending books to Maui?
3,condition not so good,This was a gift for my son-in-law. He knew it wouldn't be new and he loved it. The reason I gave it 3 stars- it really wasn't in good condition as stated.
5,Hoyle's book of rules,The book arrived looking like it was brand new. I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,"Bigger, possibly better","I was looking for a book on card games and knew about Hoyle, this one is complete with dominoes, cards, dice, and board games. I am still discovering new games and just wish I had more people to try them with."
5,A truly spectacular tea,"This tea is easily one of the best in Davidson's line. An intoxicating blend of rich cherry and scrumptious almond, this tea also has the honey note that makes it sweet at brewing. The scent alone is enough to make anyone smile, but the taste is perfection at any temperature. I've tried it from very hot to using it in iced tea and I am delighted with the results every time.Highly recommended!"
3,Good but not great,Would be an excellent commentary if the author did not skip 3 chapters. This commentary is one of the best for leading Bible study. The author writes well and I was disappointed to see that whole chapters are skipped.For that reason I cannot recommend the book for leading a Bible study.
5,Great Book,"I really liked this book. I thought it was excellent. I enjoyed reading about the man Wallace Neff and reading about his architectural career and seeing photos of his works. Yes, there could have been more photos-but what was there was nice. And I must commend the publisher as these days I find so many typographical errors when reading books--and I did not find ONE typo!!! A very well done book."
4,Love it,"I was needing a fun rpg to play on my psp. First I tried Vahalla Knights 2 and it didn't quite do it for me. It's a pretty good game but just didn't have what I was looking for. See my review on that game if you wish to know more. Anywho, last night I picked up a copy of Brave Story and I must say it's really fun. I love the music and anime-style graphics of this game. It has that fun factor I was looking for. It's visually appealing and fun to play."
5,Amazing!,"This game is probably, in my opinion, the very first great and solid RPG on the PSP to date. The story is very interesting and the load times are amazing according to how the graphics look. Everything looks so beautiful in this game and they even have a fun minigame with chicken-looking birds! Definetly worth buying."
2,Too bulky,This strap I thought was a good idea but I never use it because of its stiffness and bulk.It also itches the neck. I'm sure its tough but just how tough I'll never know because I dont use it..
5,"Finally, a good book on Photoshop","Most computer books spend plenty of time showing you what you can do. In this Photoshop book, you learn how you use the program. The lessons are straight forward and easy to follow. As you progress through the book, you find yourself using the new techniques and gaining speed and knowledge of the program. I wish that more manuals were written this way. Perhaps Adobe should include this book with the software since it is much more useful than the manuals.If you want to learn Photoshop, start here."
2,Problem with Page 109-Page 111,"I just read two lessons, and between page 109-page 111, there are a few paragraphs on ""Creating evenly spaced buttons for a web page"". Every time I tried to drag the styles on to view inside ImageReady, the style is applied to the while view swallowing EVERY button in the view. I don't know whether the editors tested the instructions thoroughly."
4,"Good creative jazz, well played","I've been listening to this album for years on cassette, and have never tired of it, I'm sorry I looked too late to get the CD, finding now that its out of stock. The best piece on this album is the ""Prelude Opus 28, No. 20 and Variations. This Prelude, one of a collection composed by Chopin, has always been a favorite, and Mr. Bernhardt's rendition and following variatons in jazz are creative and very well played. All the other selections are lively and creative, a real listening pleasure."
3,Tired of your guidebook?,"When you've had enough of your guidebook and the evening news, pick up this collection of stories for a different take on the nation's capital.One in a series of noir short story anthologies by Akashic Books, DC Noir offers a mini education in the neighborhoods, histories, tensions and daily tragedies that make up this much talked about but little known city. The stories deal with the DC that falls in the shadows of the monuments - the hookers and desperate housewives, the thugs and the insane, the teenage punks and Holocaust survivors.The writing was of generally high quality, though uneven and generic in places. Stories of note are ""The Confidential Informant"" by George Pelecanos; ""First"" by Kenji Jasper; ""The Names of the Lost"" by Richard Currey; ""East of the Sun"" by Jennifer Howard; David Slater's ""Stiffed""; Lester Irby's ""God Don't Like Ugly""; and Ruben Casteneda's ""Coyote Hunt""."
4,"Good product, overall",This was a good purchase for me overall. It is build well and transports easy. The only exception I have with this is the fact that the small cans do not last long enough. But great when needed.
2,mr heater,I think it would be valuable to a potential customer to know the condition of the reconditioned buddy heater.
2,Disappointment guaranteed,"I bought this cd for two reasons. Firstly, it is a product of the cool Upstairs Records, which has brought out worthwhile artists such as The Verbrlli Sound Experience, (aka Telefuzz) and others. Also because I read that the artist is a fan of Genesis and Yes. On the basis of this I thought that at least melody would not be an issue.Well, I was wrong. I have not been able to trace one memorable melody on the entire cd. Neither is there anything original to redeem this fact, if you accept ambient/electronic music as an established genre. Virtually every track starts of with a spoken introduction, to the point that one has to question artistic integrity,if it is remembered that it was the exact modus operandi of The Irresistible Force.Eventualy the feeling is confirmed that Gel-Sol cannot produce anything but by inane repetition."
3,"Revenge is sweet, but . . .","This book was cute, and the men characters for the most part were jerks, to say the least. But how sorry am I really supposed to feel for these women? Of course it would be humiliating to be left for a younger woman, but being society gals, everything seemed to be revolved around money. In real life, deserted wives often don't get child support. The financial problems of these women post-divorce seem to be keeping face among the co-op snooties. One of the characters, Annie, panics when her ex-husband drains their Down's Syndrome-afflicted daughter's trust fund to play the stock market, and Annie doesn't know how she'll afford the expensive home the daughter lives in. Annie contemplates how she'll ever come up w/ the tuition AS SHE DRIVES HER JAGUAR TO VISIT (only because the poor woman can no longer afford her chauffered limo)!"
2,Unnecessarily Sadistic,"Almost all the time books tend to be better than the movies that they were made into. Perhaps this is because the movie has so much product placement, and this plot is always reworked. But here, the book turned out to be worse than the movie. The movie was funny and great, but the book, which I read before seeing to movie, Is overly sadistic, drags on in many places, to mention just a few flaws. I would definetly see the movie instead."
3,"Enjoyed the book, annoyed by the movie.","A good read. The movie was silly while the book has a more serious tone. Actually, the book is almost nothing like the movie. Read/see both and decide for yourself. I really liked ""The Bestseller"" and ""Fashionably Late"", even though they seemed to drag in spots."
3,Don't expect the movie,"Where the film adaptation of The First Wives Club was witty and made for fluffy entertainment and a showcase for three good actresses, the book is a 180 degree turn. For example, the wisecracking lesbian daughter of Diane Keaton's character is, in the book, a younger girl with Down's Syndrome, and the husband/father is far crueller than the one portrayed in the film. The entire subplot involving the husband of the friend who committed suicide is omitted from the film entirely.The book is darker, as is the humor. One could tend to agree with another reviewer that The First Wives' Club comes off as a treatise on man-bashing; I believe Ms. Goldsmith had experienced a similar situation before writing the book, hence the inspiration. Nonetheless, I liked the book somewhat when I first read it; Goldsmith does display a good wit and can tell an interesting story. I read other works and believe this is still the best of the lot."
3,"Ok, but not a great zoom camera","I bought this camera, since I trusted the Kodak name and did not want an APS camera, since it seems about all they make now days. I used about 5 rolls of film. Some pictures came out great and others came out with a blue tint to them. Not sure why. I decided to take this camera back and upgrade to a higher zoom. If you have small kids and want to capture those great moments, I don't recommend this camera. Sorry Kodak. Maybe if you made it in a higher zoom range."
1,Not up to the hype.,"I ordered ""theboom"" back on October 21st. I just received the unit (12/29). I had been promised the unit for Christmas but that didn't happen even though I called several times and was assured it would be delivered in time.They said they were upgrading the orders to 3 day select (to make sure they got to the customers on time)... I was billed for 2nd day air (according to the invoice) but it was sent 3 day select.The adapter that was sent does not work with my phone. I tried using the ""standard"" adapter with other phones around the house but I got no audio.The ear piece rattles around on my ear even after adjusting it per their quick start guide. I think it's going to fall off everytime I move my head.This thing is going back. In my opinion, it's not worth the pain especially at $149.00 plus shipping."
3,Not a lot of help with younger children,"I have to cop to not reading the entire book yet. As another reviewer indicated, it does seem like a good deal of filler. It also presents children as evil little manipulators and doesn't offer a lot of help for whining toddlers. I think it is important for parents to recognize when they caused the whining behavior. For instance, I kept my one-year old out shopping a bit past lunch and naptime the other day. The fact that she started whining was not manipulation on her part, but merely her varbalization of a problem that was my fault. That said, I think some of their solutions may be helpful. It's just that the helpful part could have been stated in about 15-20 pages."
2,WAY OVER PRICED!!,"This is a good old game that any yugioh lover would like to add to their collection, But it's NOT worth the price you crooks are charging!$40-$60 dollars are you kidding me!!??and the Kaiba expansion pack is even worse around $70-$100!!??Lower the price, cause the game not worth the amount your selling it for!!"
3,good card game; doesn't play over internet,"I like card games, and I don't like shelling out hundreds for all the actual cards. This game has over 300 cards to work with, has a good AI, and can be played at a friend's house with two computers. It doesn't have internet support, which would make it better."
1,Too many non-recipes!!!,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I certainly believe we need to eat better, and that was why I purchased this. I don't need to buy this book to know enough to purchase french fries and ""bake according to instructions"", or BOCA Vegan Burgers ""cook following package directions"". Then, for cooked vegetables, ""Cascadian Farms frozen vegetables cooked to package directions"". But wait!! There's more like these examples. This might be useful for a Brownie troop. Sorry I wasted the money. Too much money for too little info."
5,Love It,I love this Elemis tea tree spray. This was just what I needed for the winter to spray my back. Thanks Elemis.
3,Products Named Click'N Burn,Why are there two CD burning products called Click'N Burn Pro from different manufacturers? This is confusing.
5,Any student of politics should read this book,"There is no reason, whatsoever, for any student of politics not to read these amazing insights from one of the greatest political minds in American history."
5,like,I am a fan of Vanessa Paradis. I was recommended to listen to Carla. I knew she was a model ( so what?) but wow I must admit this girl can sing and I love the arrangements of the songs. Beautiful!
1,No Talent,"Ah come on. Carla Bruni is just the latest piece of fluff to flutter through the media cypersphere, trying to capitalize on her relationships with famous and powerful men like Mick and Sarko . She joins the company of other feckless pretty women of the world who have no talent and no originality, like Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. Look for this non-enity to star in an upcoming Hollywood vehicle made just for her. Sorry, but another pretty face just doesn't cut it any more."
3,Rating Dell,Great product. I wish that I didn't have to sink with the computer in order for it to pick up the internet. It had a great price.
3,A little Outdated,I just returned from a Trans Mongolian (july 09). The fares for almost everything listed in this book have increased. The city guide was dissapointing.
2,--,"I picked up this book because of the cover. If you care about the scientific story, read it in the review literature. If you want a good read, look elsewhere."
4,informative,Has alot of information in the book plus its a workbook like you had in grade school so you write in it like a handwriting practice book.It gives you detailed directions on printing Mandarin.I am a beginner so it seems to be working but good value for the price.It was new and of good quality.
3,Super big face but cool looking,I originally brought this for my husband casue the picture does not make it look so big but he said it is huge so we are giving it to his father who rides motorcycles and we think he will like it
3,If at first......,"Well, today my second one arrives after the first one, fresh out of the box, didn't work and one of the buttons fell off. Going by the quality of the materials and presentation box, it is surprising such faults made it through QA. Let's hope the replacement is flawless!"
1,This book is a mindless mish-mash of unoriginal ideas,"This book starts badly and decreases from there. There is a lack original characters. The female character (forgotten her name because it was insignificant, like the book) was killed and a tacky, plastic interpretation of the afterlife follows. I stopped reading this book after 170 odd pages and the only reason i got to that page was due to utter disbelief."
5,I Will Remember This Book,"This book was sad, funny, mysterious and a little bit of romance (I wouldn't really say that her boy friend cheating on her was romance, but...).I thought this book was very enjoyable, but the beggining could have been a little bit better.This is my favourite of Christopher Pike books. It is about a girl who dies by falling of off a belcony. She knows that she was murdered and she wants to find out who did it, so she trails everyone one of the people who was at the party in which she was killed and along the way she meets, Peter, a boy that she was good friends with and he had kiled himself.Read this book if you are into any of those things that I had mentioned that this story has. You'll enjoy it."
5,A book sure to die for!!!,"Remember me is a great book and it is so hard to put it down till you finish it! I really enjoyed the book and I think a lot of people should read it, too. Even college and high school students enjoyed the book. I love the main character because she is smart and pretty by how Pike describes her. So, again you should read it!!"
1,So Predictable,"An acceptable beach read, possible. Predictable plot, boring dialogue, blasé characters. I really only finished it because I was killing time while traveling. Not recommended unless for anyone with any decent level of imagination."
5,Books,You can never go wrong with a Karen Robards book. Hunter's Moon is one of her better books no doubt.
3,Great toy...if it worked correctly,"This would be a fun and educational toy that almost any kid would enjoy. However, mine did not work correctly - it made the wrong sounds for the letters that were inserted. After looking at the other reviews, it seems that I'm not the only one who received a defective toy."
1,Teaching the wrong sort of word,"My 3 year old received this toy as a gift today and we were happy as we have liked the Leapfrog products she has so far but the Leapfrog Fridge Words horrified me. Why? because my child is running around the house yelling ""B#TCH"" because thats what the Leapfrog fridge words taught her to say, rather than ""Bit"" This is not a joke review, you can see my video of it on youtube. I immediately contacted Leapfrog customer service and they were very unconcerned even though I played the toy saying the word for them twice. When my kid gets kicked out of preschool for saying a word like that, are they going to take responsibility? Could have at least got a half hearted ""sorry"" I would recommend staying away from this particular Leapfrog product. Seems like it may have been a good toy if it didn't swear at me."
1,Just not working out,"The first Word Whammer I got for my daughter for Christmas, really excited by the reviews and never having a previous problem with any Leap Frog products. The middle section would only say the letter ""A"". After a customer service battle with Leap Frog, Amazon.com finally replaced the first one. Now, after minimal use, the only thing that it will do is begin to sing the ABC song, and then get stuck and start to repeat. I'm very disappointed."
1,Disappointed with this leap frog item,"A few months ago, I bought my son the fridge phonics set and it didn't work; even after switching batteries and cleaning the battery contacts as recommended by the manufacturer. Back to the store it went. Wal-mart informed me that a lot of them have been returned. Sad. At any rate, my son got the Word Whammer for Christmas. Again, the same thing. What a pain to have to turn the thing off and on between EVERY word, AND then have the thing only recognize the letter ""A"" in the center space. It got returned the day after Christmas as well."
5,Fridge Words Magnetic Word Building,Product was exceptional value and provided hours of fun for my niece. She was very excited with the music and placing the letters.
3,Very disappointed in the number and case of letters provided.,My granddaughter had the Word Whammer and we had lots of fun w/ word hunt and rhyming three letter words.This set has only 28 lower case letters making it impossible to do the 3 letter words game unless each letter is unique. You can't even do bee! Lower case letters only and only 2 extras limits its educational value.I purchased the companion alphabet set to get the 26 upper case letters but it still isn't enough. The letters are too small to fit the word whammer so the two are not interchangeable.
2,Good in theory,"This toy is great if it works all of the time. I returned the first toy that we received as a gift because I thought it was broken. Letters can be inserted into slots and then the toy says the letter and word that corresponds. Unfortunately, a common problem with the toy is the little grooves that decipher which letter is which, get stuck quite often and when the child places a new letter in the groove, the toy incorrectly 'says' what it thinks is the new letter/word. When I returned my first 'broken' toy, the store informed me that this was a common problem and you need to run your fingers over the grooves to loosen them. This does not work all of the time. The second replacement toy has the same problem. When young children are trying to learn new letters and words, this problem can be very confusing (and annoying to the parent.)"
2,not the best,"we had gotten this toy for my son's birthday. Well after he played with it a while it got dropped, then it didn't work right it just keep saying the same thing over and over, if you tried to spell a word it would finish the word but not the song, so I took it back and got another one the same thing happened to this one like a week or two later. I liked the toy but I guess if your kids are ruff it is not the one. He liked it before it broke. My daughter also liked it but she only one."
2,Prejudice in word choice,"At first I thought this toy was a great way to allow my son to learn phonics and for the most part it was. Until we started playing around the word builder function that I realized Leapfrog selectively de-sensitize the word ""GOD"". It does not recognize it and all it said was it's a good word. What?! Huh?! Regardless of my religious belief, I don't want to give a false impression to the little one that G-O-D isn't a word! Hello, Leapfrog, of all people and for someone who attempts to be an educator, you ought to know the difference between merely teaching a word over proselytizing others.how far do we go with this kind of prejudice. give me a break."
3,I bought the wrong book,"I bought this book for my son's collection of best behavior books but it is not the same board book collection that he has, they have 2 different collections of books with the same name, so I had to return it and order the right one."
4,Not too shabby,"Honestly, I would like to rate Joi's second album somewhere between three and four stars, but I'll round up. Its simply that this CD's a mixed bag, albiet better than many others. The tracks that are great are great: the wonderfully emotive build-up of 'Journey', the melodious crescendos and orchestrations of 'Prem', the pounding breaks of 'Tacadin'. Most of the rest, however, while not exactly lackluster, are simply more of the same. Which isn't exactly a bad thing, seeing as how that means the album on the whole is much better than most of the stuff out there. The long and the short of it is that if you're looking for some more Joi, here it is, and, to quote Jack Nicholson in Mars Attacks, ""that ain't bad."""
5,"I love this book, PLEASE PRINT MORE SO THAT I CAN BUY MORE!!","This cookbook is the GREATEST! I have given them as gifts to at least 5 friends and everyone loves them. I have been searching high & low and failed to find any. My sister wants one & I refuse to part with mine, so please let me know how I can purchase this book. I would like to buy at least 3 books. I do not want to win the contest. I would just want the buy more. PLEASE HELP ME!"
1,It sucks! Don`t let your children infest with this!,"It`s a movie just for the cartoon hard fans, but no message other than violence and competence.Sorry."
3,Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie,"The Japanese told my Mom that the unedited japanese-dubbed version of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" movie will be released in Japan in theaters on Christmas Eve, 2004! My friend, Tom Wilson told me that the 4kids company are making the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Movie Directors' cut! It will include the theatrical version with four audio languages: English, spanish, french, and japanese. Also, it will include the Directors' cut version and It will include the japanese audio track with english subtitles! This is gonna be great!!!!!"
3,stuff you didnt know,in the film you may see mistakes andother things like i thoughtthat it was a tv duel dat whas long also you may not know that peguses did not invent duel cards johan heishin and simon muran did and simon taught yugioh
1,Damn this is CRAP!!!!!,"ADVANCE NOTE:I'm exactly 13, I'm just using kids review.Whatever.I don't care what you people say!!!This movie sucks enough said. If you want anime, stay farway from this sad excuse for a movie. Even if you are a yugioh fanatic DO NOT WATCH THIS!!!!! OK, you wouln't listen to me. Then go ahead and suffer though 90 minutes of hell. Only a dumbass would reccomend this movie. Even I know enough about yugioh to notice the flaws that occure during the duels. Seriously, don't watch this DVD, don't touch it, Don't look at it and for godsake run away. I'm warning don't get within 10 yards of this movie."
1,Waaaaah!,What a terrible movie.You know a movie sucks if an otaku wouldn't watch it( Otakus are famous for watching mind numbing crap.)Yu Gi Oh the movie (what a generic title) is lame. Think of this as a hour and a half Yu Gi Oh episode complete with a somewhat better storyline. If you can call it a storyline that is.
1,Was not meant to be....,"Yu-gi-oh the series is quite popular among kids and it's only fair that they made a movie. After all pokemon had it's chance and so did digimon, but yugioh was certainly not meant to be. The film is rather extremely dull and is just a big repeat of the series. Fake drama, end of the world yada yada, only yugi can save us. I understand it's anime- however I am an anime fanatic. Yugioh the movie is definetly not worth seeing. I wish there was a refund..."
3,No description so I ordered the wrong kind....,"This item has a contour along the angle, making it only suitable to install in vehicles with leaf springs below the axle. The item description says nothing of this, so I ordered it thinking it was a straight angle (for leaf springs above the axle) for my jeep cherokee. Now I need to buy a new 6 degree shim :("
2,Very Disappointing -,"Johnny Carson was my favorite comedian - however, his early years just weren't that good - no stand-up, no Ed McMahon, no laughs. It's a wonder he went on to become a star with this bland performance."
4,Beans are interesting!,"Chef Dave (http://users.mwci.net/~lapoz/Bean.html) Says: This book contains all sorts of historical information scattered about, in bits and pieces, throughout the book. It's a very interesting read! For instance, did you know that the prominent families of ancient Rome were all named after beans! The recipes are listed next to nutrition guidelines which are easy to read and good to know. There is a reference guide in the back, and I wish they would have included some references for buying gourmet beans. The recipes themselves are simple to follow and don't require much juggling of pans"
4,"Very good survey, but not exactly what I was looking for","This is a great survey of power electronics for someone with a modest electrical engineering background. It presents terminology, hardware, circuits and analysis in an approachable and well organized way. After reading it, someone with little prior experience can have a clear sense of what the field is about, what devices are available, and what technology is appropriate for specific power and voltage levels.That said, as another reviewer pointed out, the book is a little light on math and detailed circuit topology. Erickson and Maksimovic was a much better fit for my needs."
3,back support bra,the support is great but the nylon material is a bit itchy around the breast area some thing to consider if you have sensitive skin.
2,poor quality,"these glasses are of poor quality. the edges are not smooth. the shape looks weird. the height is too big, the lower edges always touch my face."
3,Cheap look,"Product will do its job, but as far as the looks it looks like a very cheap plastic. I wouldn't recommend it as it will break easily and has to be handled with extreme care. It is made of a very thin plastic."
1,Not smart..,Gem topped barbells are NOT a smart idea.. This thing cut the roof of my mouth so badly.. Not to mention the bead with the gem on it is halfassed glued on.. so that FELL OFF completely in my mouth.Terrible quality.
2,Only got about one third into the book and shelved it!,"Wish I read the reviews here before I bought the Case is Altered..my first experience with Martha Grimes, and probably my last. Didn't grab me quick enough, or am I being too impatient? Any of you reviewers, who panned the book, got a recommendation for me in the mystery genre? Something well written, not unlike PD James, whose books I've exhausted, but not as drab as this one seems. I hate to quit on a book...but, my time is valuable too, Ms.Grimes."
2,retirement long overdue,"The next book should probably feature Melrose Plant instead as the lead. He's the most interesting and fully developed character in the entire series, and the only one worth reading about."
3,It works,"It works. My questions is; why are you people forcing us buyers to say something about your product if some of us do not want to share our opinion with others, most important item with this is NOT TO BOTHER US! Hope you have a better day tomorrow."
2,wrong cable,Everything was cheap and came with 2 so I ordered it. When received in mail one was fine other was 2male to one female. But the one that is the correct product works great but i need another one to split other audio cable the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the 1 that is the right product works good
3,Lost Vikings Clone?,"Anybody who has ever played a Lost Vikings game back in the day will be familiar with this game...It's the same concept, same mechanics..you have three zombies, and you have to use each one for their unique special abilities in order to get through the levels, which are pretty much giant mazes/puzzles.The graphics are nice for DS, and look like a comic book. There's voice overs too for intros and cut scenes.The game is fun if you like the Lost Viking style of gaming, but with that said it's a short game, and not worth full price.Buy it for 10 bucks or so where available, but dont pay more than that."
5,A MOST HELPFUL VIDEO!,"As someone who felt very naive about real estate investing and hence hesitant, this instructional DVD was a godsend. Thorough, clear, concise, realistic -- full of great information. I feel much more confident now as I embark upon my new vocation."
2,"a book, that's about all I can say.","I have several other books on Revelation that I think do a better job of getting to the details of the book. At this point, I think it was overrated, but with time I may feel differently about the product---please keep in mind, I have only read about 50 pages of the book at this point, but I think it lacks something. I am teaching thru Revelation and have laid this book aside to concentrate on those that help me get started---I'm sure I will return to it again later due to the integrity of the author, but for now, I question the value of the purchase.Bob Wilson"
3,ipod essential,"I love this ipod car kit. It allows you to listen to all the music on your ipod through the car's speakers. The only thing I don't like is the hissing noise in the background when listening at more than a soft level. You can try different channels but sometimes that doesn't help. Overall though, it is a good product."
4,An Excellent Start to C++ Builder,"Teach Yourself Borland C++ Builder in 21 Days, is a thorough and fun book to learn C++ Builder. It will show you all the ins and outs, tips and tricks of learning VCL programming that other books cannot match. I am a self-taught, experienced Delphi programmer, who has read many books on VCL programming. If I had a book like this when learning Delphi, my bookshelf would contain a lot less books"
5,"A very good intro to Builder, esp. for database development","I learned alot from this book. The chapters on database development and Internet development are quite good. I've been really happy with Ken Henderson's other books, and this one didn't disappoint me. His singular wit and matter-of-factness are greatly in evidence in the portions of the book he wrote. Not to take anything away from Kent R., but what made this book for me was the to-the-point style for which Henderson is famous, as well as the motherloade of good info in the Internet and database chapters. Definitely recommended for beginners and intermediate Builder developers."
3,Decent,"This book is not one to learn off of. It does not give good code examples, nor any explanation behind the little amount of code it does give you. For programmers who already know the language well, it is a great reference book. You would be better of teaching yourself through the Borland Builder help files."
2,it's alright,"the price is alright but if you are looking for something that will last you more than a few weeks i suggest you consider looking at something else.for my purpose, i was satisfied."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"SERIOUSLY, this had to be one of the WORST movies I have ever laid eyes on. The acting was HORRENDOUS! I felt like i was watching fledgling student actors improv about 95% of the movie. The death scenes were completely uninventive and unexciting. The plot could have been really cool, but the directing, production, cinematography and acting were all sooooooooooooooooooo bad that there was no saving this disaster of a movie. I also want to state how shocked I was at the camera work and overall movie ""QUALITY""...because this movie looked like it was filmed on a 500 dollar camcorder. Not even SLIGHTLY scary, and incredibly boring. Don't waste your time on this trash. It's definetly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only people I could see enjoying this movie would be fans of that guy from Kyle XY since he is in it."
5,Discrete and pleasing,"I saw this perfume on display at the discount store. I absolutely loved the packaging that comes in a see through plastic container that is very interesting when it comes to figuring out how to open it. The price for the product was right so I bought the perfume without any hesitation. The best part if the top of the bottle. It has silver color cap (that is made of steel), and it closed very tightly. On the bottom of it are two golden rings, somewhat hanging loose around the cap. The bottle itself has a picture, trademark mother and child in golden color. But the scent is the best part. It is not overpowering and it is perfect for casual wear. I got lots of compliments wearing it. I put it on during the day. I guess I only wish I knew what wonderful flowers are part of the fragrance. It is definitely one of my personal favorites."
5,"Beautiful, outstanding quality!","These rods are just gorgeous! They are very heavy, so they have to be screwed into the stud. They have a bit of copper weaving throughout the rod and boy, it's just beautiful. These look amazing in a Victorian house and be sure to get all the matching accessories and the faucets! Look around for a better price - we paid about half this price. Highly recommend!"
3,"Fun, but disapointing","I am a major RCT junkie, but i am a bit dissapointed with RCT2. It is a fun game, but it doesn't feature many improvments from the origional (and there were a lot of things that could have used some improving). The graphics are the same, the handymen are just as stupid and still get stuck, you can still only view from 4 different angles, and they removed the ability to play it in a window on you desktop (or at least I havn't seen how yet).On the plus side, they've added some new rides, new shops, and new ways of adding scenery. One nice feature is the ability to build shops/bathrooms above another path or water.Overall, this is a fun game (as was the origional). But don't expect too many new and exciting features. This game is really more like an expansion to the origional RCT. But hey, ... I guess I can't complain"
1,Not for Original RTC fans~,"This sequel is such a major disappointment for those of us who have played and fell in love with the original RTC and those expansion packs. Too many choices have been taken away and the real strategy and skill needed in the original game has been dimished. Very very limited graphic improvements, some even negative graphic changes. A few more rides but many of your fun choices for scenery and themes is gone. This pack is a HUGE disappointment for RTC fans and the only good thing is...it will definitely cure you of those late night, 5 hour RTC playing sessions. I played this game less than 10 times now, and have given the thing away. What a huge shame."
1,dissapointing,i just got it today and its not what i expected. Its not that theres anything wrong with it but for the rct1 gamer you wont like it. Its really not that different from rct1. sure better graphics and a couple new rides but it still has most of the same problems as rct1 and its expansions. AI are just as stupid and its still lacking the game engine to recreate a real park. i was all hyped for it but now im very dissapointed. Still its on [...] i say u giv it a shot
4,add ability to ride the rides,I revieved this game from my husband for Valentine. I wanted it because it has rollercoaters from SF parks. I rode quite a few of these rides and the PC game rides are like the ones I rode. I wished you could ride these rides on the computer game. It would make it much better. I really enjoy playing the game I don't even play my PS2 rollercoaster game now that I have this one.
5,Great game!,Was cool to find it in Amazon for just $3.50Is good to see that Amazon sell these old games that some of us still love.
3,Only for hardcore fans,"What can I say this game was not the best, yes I did have improvements but yet I was pretty bored after the first scenerio.Its pretty much the same as the other RCT but with Six Flags rides to it. Yes ir had new rides (etc) but not very intresting challenges like one said go do this for so long and have this many people in your park. Does that sound intresting to you? If it does go ahead and buy it, but if it doesn't stick to the orginal RTC series."
4,"Very Good! But they should call this Expansion Pack, not RCT",Good game! A lot of new stuff! But i would call a expansion pack.... Proximo q venha!
3,Basically a stand-alone expansion disk,"I bought this game at a local retail store yesterday. (It was on the shelves early). Here's the good and bad.GOOD- New rides, new scenario/coaster builders, guests do a few new things (like watch you build a new coaster)Six Flags parks, faster and higher coasters, new brake blocks cut down on accidents.BAD- A few bugs here and there (waiting on a patch), Six Flags parks are incomplete (scenario tells you to finish the park yourself!) some real-world rides have different names (""Superman the Escape"" becomes ""The Escape""), still can't zoom in any closer to your guests, V2 coaster doesn't operate true to original, disk in a paper sleeve (no jewel case)It may have a new engine, but it looks and acts just like the orginal. I don't feel this is really a sequel, it's more like an expansion."
3,OK but not that much different,"Well, to start off, this game was OK. It had great new rides,landscape,scenery,and features, it was FUN for a while.I bought rollercoaster tycoon when it had just come out and all of its expansions and I was hooked. This game is not much different. I just got boerd of so much rollercoaster tycoon. I would not reccomend this game to current rollercoaster tycoon 1 gamers. But I would reccomend it to anyone who doesn't own it. Don't get me wrong, its a great game... but you get tired of it really EASILY for someone who has owned the origianal."
5,THE BEST GAME!,"Oh my god! This is the gratest game ever created, but only for those who know the ""tricks of the trade"" such as me. To learn these tricks, I sugguest buying Prima's Official Strategy for Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. Even if you choose to not get the strategy guide, you will still have at least four stars of fun trying to build a good theme park. This is som much better than the first one, so don't let the fact that the first one sucks be the deciding factor in your choice of buying this item. You can do almost anything in this game if you put your mind to it. GET THIS GAME!!!..."
3,RCT2 not worth a separate game nice expansion though,"RCT2=RCT w/ loopy landscapes + six flags parks (who cares), more roller coaster types (...'configurations' presented as types bloats up number of coaster types), partial scenario editor (somewhat cool), track designer (somewhat cool; better if they were combined), new bugs (not cool - some rides don't post test results and therefore unridable; no patches ever released), and a much higher altitude limit (totally rad - 400 foot vertical coasters!)."
5,Great game,"I love Rollercoaster Tycoon. It is fun and challenging. I was so excited when rollercoaster tycoon. I'll give you a run down of the features.Graphics: The graphics are about the same as rollercoaster tycoon.Scenery: Lots of new scenery and theming ideasRides: Loads and loads of new rides and even some sixflags ridesFeatures: A handy new feature is the........( techinally, there is no name or it) Remeber when you were making pre-desogned rides and had to remove millions of trees before being able to build it? Well, in rct2, it does it for you. And for rollercoasters and some other rides, it has a pre built entrance and exit, as well as pre built queue lines and exit paths. Another new thing is the scenario editor, where you make your own scenario. I recommend getting RollerCoaster Tycoon 2:Triple Thrill Pack."
3,Locks up,This game is fun but very challenging. It locks up and shuts down for no reason not always saving your efforts
5,the best!,"This project comes to remind us that west coast music/ AOR is alive and happening! I has excelent musicians, the music is beautifully executed, the singers do an exelent job in every song,the horn section just hits the spot! I think it can't get better than this, it is a must have!I just wish it had 100 songs in it!"
2,District 9,"This movie was overrated. I think the biggest hype pusher was the fact that Peter Jackson had anything to do with it. ""Peter Jackson Presents"" is what you saw at the movie theater trailers and and the beginning on the dvd. He neither wrote nor directed it. I'll just lay out what sucked in this movie:CGIThe aliens (I mean come on, if they are so intelligent, why are they so obsessed with rummaging through garbage and getting cat food? They resembled ghetto slum people, not an intelligent alien race...)The shaky camera work. It strained my eyes really bad. I wish they stopped with that.It didn't feel like it was making any sense most of the time. Cloverfield is what they were aiming for here..."
4,Great Sci Fi,Nice to see aliens sometimes land outside of the US. I was also surprised at how good the special FX were. Very realistic.
5,district 9,"a first time director with a 10,000 budget created this eye popping and jaw dropping movie. the movie is hitting the millions in profits. one of the best movies that i have ever seen as a critic and one of the most intense metaphors ever putted on motion. must see"
3,"Ok, but not great","This movie is not a bad movie persay, but it does not capture your imagination. I had a hard time feeling sympathy for the main characters. After about an hour I noticed I was checking regularlly to see how much longer the movie was. It could have been much better, but I would suggest buying a used verson or Netflik rather then new. You probablly won't watch it more than once or twice."
3,interesting movie not to bad,"okay movie for sci fi action movie with a twist. Nothing special, but nothing bad either. Give or take, will not purchase on BR. Maybe if/ when on sale for $5"
1,District 9,"Not my cup of tea,would recommend to die-hard scifi fans. I should have known since Peter Jackson(Lord of the rings EW!) presents it, and this is a rookie director's first movie(hopefully the last? or no sequel)The movie is not bad, it's just the message that somehow Human beings are bad and greedy. That we would use alien technology,etcera. Another one of those deep social messages like avatar. First off, If it were aliens they would do the same thing.Second, Yes it's science fiction. but poor science fiction. sorry but I don't want preachy over-lying ""Anti-Imperialist"" themes that are so passe."
2,Odd,The movie is very unusual which you may like. I didn't like it. It started in a slow documentary style and continued in that style off and on. It was a gritty kind of sci fi futuristic movie. I thought that it was boring and uninteresting.
2,Warning: Hand-held Camera Work May Induce Nausea,"Warning! When movie critics review a movie, they should include a warning about the unfortunate trend that directors seem to be over-indulging in -- hand-held cameras. The premise of this movie intrigued me immensely. Right off, I wanted to stick around and watch how it developed. I'm guessing the director thought the hand-held camera work would convey a more documentary-like feeling of verite and a sense of urgency. However, after about 15 minutes of watching jittery hand-held, fast-panned, jumpy movements on the screen, the only sense of urgency I had was to leave the theatre, right away. I had to settle for a retelling of the movie's plot and conclusion from my husband. Perhaps it will not be as nausea-inducing on the small screen as it was on the big one. If not, take your dramamine before viewing and then, enjoy."
2,District 9,"Generally speaking, i just did not care very much for this movie. Maybe it's just a personal thing, but after the novelty of the cool-looking aliens wore off, I just got tired of the lack of plot and the poor script. The special effects though, were good."
3,It was OK,Thought the movie was OK - just beware its more like a documentary and than an action packed movie like I thought it was going to be. It's different but not too terribly bad.
1,Won't play in Sony BDP-S300,"This is the only blu-ray disc that I have ever had that will not play. The player I have is the slowest loader ever (Sony BDP-S300) so I just spent a half hour while it loaded previews then finally a screen with graphics and no play button multiple times. Then, it just sits on a black screen forever then says can't play. Man I wish HD-DVD had won. I never had a slow load with HD-DVD or any problems. The thing that sucks with sony as well is if your on a Mac they have to send you an update. Which means for me, buy another player just to see HD of district 9, or wait for an update to see if that works. Or, send the disc back. anyone else have problems? I will never buy another Sony blu-ray playr that's for sure."
1,Crap.,"A completely horrible movie. The idea behind it was alright, but the execution was atrocious. It was a boring blend of faux-documentary and tried to perceive a semblance of emotion with the whole family angle. The feeling of the movie is cheap yet the aliens cost money to produce. The film needed a better film direction."
3,Prawns are usually tasty! These? Not so much! Still a good movie.,"Ok, ok....I am reading the reviews here and I love the passion although some people are either too harsh or making this out to be a masterpiece! It's not either, it is a good movie with some interesting plot lines and solid acting. The special effects are excellent and when you consider the budget was fairly small it gets high merits. The movie starts off very slow and takes some time before it really turns it up! Give it a chance, it is a very good movie.NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The disc is beautiful and the sound rich. The special features are interesting and informative. Not really a 'DEMO DISC' but if you jumped to the end it can be. Worthy of ownership."
2,Not what I expected,"Glad I rented it. I would not buy it.Pros: None that I could see.Cons: Bad special effects, Bad script, Bad Story Line, Bad movie.I would wait for it to be on HBO, Show time, ECT. Before you think of paying High price to buy it."
1,wasted,"Really? Seriously? This movie was made for millions and there are people dying in the streets in the US. Millions of people cannot afford adequate healthcare and this movie wasted millions of dollars. wtf? If I could, I would sue for the loss of the two hrs it took to watch this drivel and do something really useful with the money. The only reason I rented it was for the GOW III demo, so at least the disc is more than just a coaster. Oh well, to each his own."
1,bad blue ray disc (won't play),"I received 'District 9"" with anticipation that it would be a fun movie to watch.NOT SO!! My Blue-Ray p0layer told me that the disc was a 'different' format.I also tried using the digital download and it 'screwed up[ as well'Don't bother buying this movie in Blue-Ray!! Get the DVD instead!"
1,Bad Movie,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There was basically no story to it and it seemed the idea was to impress the viewers with the gross and disgusting graphics. Don't bother, waste of time."
5,District 9 VIDEO Review. The Inspiration for the film.,"Length:: 6:23 MinsDistrict 9 is one of the century's greatest science fiction films.Director Neill Blomkamp, producer Peter Jackson, and the unknown but extremely talented cast (including Sharlto Copley, who will be starring in Blomkamp's upcoming sci-fi Elysium and Spike Lee's Oldboy remake) crafted a film that is totally original, absolutely ingenious, heartfelt, and action packed.This entertaining short film was directed by Neill Blomkamp, and was the inspiration to direct District 9. One can indeed see the similarities between the two films.Interesting fact: The dialogue spoken by most of the ""interviewees"" was unscripted. The filmmakers asked ordinary people what they thought about the refugees living there, and what they said replied was directed at them."
2,don't waste your time or money,"Spoiler: this movie is full of such contradiction and idiotic lines its almost laughable...hey lets treat these aliens like equals by asking them to sign something before they can move and now we are going to burn their babies alive. the main actor fails to have lines of any common sense ""if i wave a gun in a government building and steal a very important vile so i can get my normal hand back then they'll take me back as i was before"".and many more things are wrong with the movie,though i realize scifi movies are rarely believable this one takes the cake"
2,Violence and Gore Detract and Make it Nearly Unwatchable,"I was hoping for an enjoyable science fiction movie that perhaps posed some questions about society and religion. Instead, the story is overrun with over the top violence and gore leaving a nearly unwatchable film. Placing the violence aside, there is an interesting story underneath, but it's buried under the filmmakers' pretentious efforts to shock the audience."
2,Didn't enjoy this movie very much,Except for the last 30 min. of the movie I didn't like it very much. I won't be viewing this video again. It's headed for 1/2 price books.
4,District 9 - Great Sci-Fi Movie,"I love science fiction movies so I am probably biased, but I enjoyed the movie. District 9 was an interesting movie, lots of action, very entertaining. I think the coarse language could be toned down some, it would have been a better movie with a little less. Overall, I highly recommend the movie."
1,Awful!,"Save your time and money. This movie is all about saying the ""F"" word 2000 times, along with a lot of bad people and aliens. Disgusting!!"
4,Great everyday/ home office printer,"This is an awesome printer for everyday, black and white printing needs. It was easy to set up, affordable, and all the tech info is downloadable online, so no need to keep up with a manual. The downside we've found is that it won't feed cardstock or heavyweight type paper. I make the cards our kids use for thanks you notes and invitations, so this lack is noticeable in our home. For just basic printing needs, it's a great buy."
2,Where's Jackie Chan??,"Jackie Chan has a maybe 12 minutes of screen time in the first two films! They have been edited and the sides of every shot are cut off. Sometimes someone will be talking and you can only see half of their face or nothing at all! Jackie Chan is fantastic, but these are not really films for Jackie Chan lovers. Maybe vintage karate movie lovers, but not Jackie Chan enthusiasts."
2,Cheap material,"Good replica of military alice pack, but material is too cheap and color is too light. It seems like it could easily rip."
1,A great disappointment,"If railroad maps are your thing, this isn't. This would be adequate as a proposal for a historical rail atlas of the U.S. It falls way short of its title since it does not deliver what it claims to. Compared Mike Walker's regional railroad atlases this is pathetic."
1,Disappointed,Purchased the book to locate ghost towns to explore in California. Very sad I wasted the $9 I guess if you are looking for a very short book for reading material while in the restroom it would be okay but the local newspaper would be a better buy.
5,Twice won't be enough!,"I LOVED this book! As I read I felt I knew the characters, because the dialogue was familiar enough (no holds barred) to have come straight from me or from any of my girlfriends. The female characters are strong women who don't pussyfoot around, unless it's with the divine men they encounter! The ONLY way to improve this page turner would be to make it keep on going! I can only hope we hear a great deal more from Gemma Bruce, and SOON!Cindy T."
3,Fun to flip through,This is cute book that is fun to flip through and keep with your dictionary. It is essentially just a small dictionary and beyond definitions doesn't go into detail on entomology.
3,Not bad - but somewhat lacking,"I really enjoyed much of the book and learned something from it. The best thing about the book is the detailed information presented on some words as to how they are used and why they were chosen. This adds a great deal of interest and information. The biggest shortcoming of the book is that only some of the words have explanatory information - and one is left to wonder why some other words even made it and what is the point of their being there. Given that it is such a short book and has only 100 words chosen for it, one wonders why more detailed and interesting information wasn't included for all of the entries. I'd say the writers just got lazy and used many of the 100 words for ""fill"". Given its price, it isn't bad, but it isn't what it could and should have been with just a tiny bit more effort."
3,buy from Amazon for its good return policy,"The first one we bought wasn't working correctly. We returned it and Amazon fed-exed another one. Thank you Amazon! Germ Guardian wasn't helpful at all. I called their help center to check if we were using it right and the return policy, and never got a call back, which was very odd. They don't have live people answering the phone, you just leave a message.We got this for the mattress because we think there may be some mold in there. My boyfriend still has his cough, but that's probably because it's cold. So I can't say if it's effective or not.If you are going to buy this, make sure you can buy it from a place that is very easy to exchange and return, seeing as our first one didn't work."
1,Not worth it with all the problems,"This was supposed to be a gift for my mother-in-law, but the first one came with a broken UV bulb, and we had to send it back. Amazon quickly replaced it, sending out the second one before we even shipped the first back. The new one lasted about 3 weeks and then the charger stopped working. Overall it's been very frustrating, and not a good gift or personal item to buy."
2,Handy tool,"I just ordered my second uv wand. I was very pleased with the first, finding it useful for mattresses, pillows,kitchen sponges, soles of shoes, computer keyboards, remotes, etc! My daughter is away at school now and living in a dorm. I brought this handy tool with me so we could do a quick cleaning and before I knew it she and the others wanted to use it. So, I thought no problem...I'll just order another."
5,Great great book,"This is not the first Ignatius book I have read, having devoured The Increment a few months ago.I loved that book and this one is better.David Ignatius is a keen observer of human nature and gets right at the heart of people's feelings, desires, and motivations.I won't go into the plot of this book, many others herein have done so.Suffice it to say that if you like novels because they show you things that matter about people and yourself, then you won't be able to put this book down."
2,"Gatsby, Schmatsby","This is a dorky book but fun. Ignatius is such a wimp, sniveling along, brown-nosing our intelligence with less than an elementary school belief system with his white knight profiling and self-feigned cluelessness. He comes up with some sweet words once in a while which chuckle up just fine. Ignatius is a zen storyteller, performing one of those acts of `chop wood, become enlightened, chop wood. This book reads fun, yes I had to repeat myself. One has a good time enjoying the story and hoping to all ends of realty that Ignatius doesn't believe half the stuff he's writing."
4,Not as bad as people say,"I've seen this DVD and yes, the video quality isn't the greatest but it isn't terrible either. It's good to reflect on what soccer was in bygone days, and this DVD can help in that regard."
4,cute and personal,This is a very cute potty. It's easy to assemble and can even be personalized with your little princess's picture
2,Quite disappointing for a teaching aid,"I absolutely love Boris Vallejo's art, and as an artist, I would love to be able to do what he can. Which is of course why you buy a book like this.I was very disappointed when I received the book. It serves more as a look back through his back catalogue of work (some unpublished stuff as well). There are a few (very few) pieces of advice and tips on how to set up your reference photos and prepare a portfolio, but overall it is so general and vague that you will learn little more than ""there is no one way to paint skin colour"" or ""it takes time to get good"". Chances are you already knew that...This book was either compiled in a hurry by request of Boris Vallejo's financial advisor, or he is simply not interested in passing on the knowledge he has of his craft. Quite disappointing."
3,Hilarious Lyrics,"The album is not great, but its not terrible either. I picked this up because I'm a big fan of Artest. Better than the other NBA rapper albums."
4,To the point,Great introduction to house wiring. I was looking for a book that would detail the types of wires needed for various automation tasks and it didn't disapoint. However it needs updating to cover distribution of HDTV signals which is starting to become common these days...
2,"Very cheaply made, very dissatisfied","I received this set from my loving wife and with in one week the brush came off the handle, the razor fell apart, the stand got wet and rusted which stained my sink with a huge red rust stain! I am left with a plastic bowl that i use to hold extra shave soaps. Very disappointed. If you are looking to buy a set there are other better made products out there."
2,same as today,This is a good explanation of what all combat veterans endure in their individual hells It is dated in its' manner but.the problems are the same today.
3,"Three stars, but just barely","Like most readers, I rather liked Justin, although he sometimes seemed undependable (he had promised her father to take care of her) and a bit wimpy. His musical talent was a delightful characteristic. It seemed odd, however, that he found it so easy to adjust to being a Duke after so many years in New Zealand. Emily is often annoying; she has spirit and strength, but she is immature and mercurial. Their relationship did sometimes have moments of unseemliness, of ""ickiness.""The book started well, but dragged later on. The ending left far too many questions still unanswered. As a whole, unsatisfactory. Only Medeiros' ability to write beautifully, to evoke emotion, and to effectively evoke a setting raises this attempt to a three-star level. For plot and characters alone, it's only 2 stars."
3,Overrated,"Honestly, I don't understand how this album has achieved such iconic status in the history of hard bop. It goes down smooth and easy--even with Jackie McLean, who can be anything but smooth and easy--but fails to leave a real or lasting mark. Perhaps the problem can be attributed to the sameness of the tunes, all of which are stuck in a mid-tempo blues format. (That's certainly why it feels too safe to me, as if nothing is really at risk in the playing.) Perhaps it's the fact that McLean, Farmer, and Clark never played with each other live. Perhaps it's the fact that Clark, though a fine piano player, does not surprise in the way that a Mccoy Tyner might in the same situation. In any case, the album feels like a soulless blowing session, one that demonstrates a lot of fine musicianship but no heart."
2,Struttin' with Sonny,"This is probably an album I will need to grow into, but I must say, at the first couple of listenings, I am not impressed. I guess I was expecting less of a horn session and more emphasis on the piano. I was inspired to buy this after enjoying Blue Note's Christmas compilation, Yule Struttin'."
1,this CD was horrible,I like the original version of this song. I don't like all the remixing they did. It's not really Bjork.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"The display fooled me into thinking that all the suspension pieces would be given, only 42 pieces came, and if you check the display its over 50 pieces, also there isn't enough information to suggest less pieces, when i saw the package i was terribly disappointed, now i still have to buy seperately those pieces missing, bomber."
3,Good Flim but....,"It's okay, but clearly not their best effort. Essential for your Flim collection but only one or two tracks are memorable."
4,Overlooked in the Whigs' Catalogue,"""Uptown Avondale"" is the last of the Whigs' releases on Sub Pop, and while somewhat of an oddity compared to the rest of their albums, it nevertheless is a great addition, and generally overlooked.""Uptown Avondale"" (5 tracks, 21 min.) contains 4 R&B; covers and one Greg Dulli song. The best covers here are Freda Payne's ""Band of Gold"" and the Supremes' ""Come See About Me"". If you didn't think that grunge-meets-motown can sound gorgeous, the Whigs prove it right here. The only Dulli tune is the 6 min. ""Rebirth of the Cool"", which made me think of the Stone Roses' ""Fool's Gold"", another classic song.This EP may not be ""essential"" in the Whigs' catalogue, but it contains some really great songs. BUY IT!(Incidentally, in case you wonder about the title of the EP, ""Uptown Avondale"" refers to a neighborhood in Cincinnati, which of course was the home base of the Whigs for most of their 15 or so years.)"
5,Black overlap on Twin Sink,Hard to find this Rubbermaid Product in stores in Black and a must have these days. Extremely Satisfied with this product and have used it for years.
5,A Biblical slant on a hot topic,A friend told us about this book and we weren't disappointed in its depth or honesty. In a culture that embraces lust we found this to contain needed spiritual resources to win that war on a personal level. Strongly recommended for teens and families of teens.
1,Highly deceptive advertising - NO BRUSHES INCLUDED,"To me, this item seems like a complete kit to clean my shotgun. Doesn't it to you? Well it's not, because it doesn't come with any brushes. Yet nowhere on this page does it say this. Classic case of false advertising. Unless you have your own brushes laying around at home (and I'm guessing you don't if you're here looking at this item) skip this and move on to another item."
1,Mwa-ha-ha!,"I think most of the readers here have pegged EPSILON dead on accurate: it isn't a novelized action/adventure but was intended to be a contemporary action-superhero-comedy, much like Disney's CONDORMAN. From the absolutely ridiculous cover portrait (why IS IT that the superhero looks so much like the profile of a guppy?) to the grandiose speechifying of the Galactic Keeper, this book is camp ... and it's bad camp, at that.If the author had followed through on his vision, he might've been dubbed an American Douglas Adams. Instead, EPSILON could probably appear as a passing joke in a Douglas Adams novel ... and not a very funny one, either.A follow-up? You mean, a sequel? Say it isn't so!"
5,are you serious?,"you've got to be kidding, a reviewer that goes by the name of ""Crossdressing Midget"" disses on this album and Pantera, and he then believes his opinion is valid and worthwhile? Lol, nice try there buddy, maybe next time you will learn to grow up (like Kommisar Lenin should do) and listen to some good music for once."
2,Just okay,"I was interested in this book when I found that Caroline Roberts was a survivor of serial killers Fred and Rose West. There isn't much about the Wests in this book. The book is mainly about Caroline's many sex partners, 4 kids from 3 men, and marriage to a man half her age. She wants the reader to feel sorry for her, but the only one I feel sorry for are her children.The chapter on what the Wests did to her is horrible. Thank goodness both were punished for what they did. Fortunately Caroline was strong enough to testify against them.Overall, not a great book, unless you are interested in Caroline's life story."
2,Just so so,I would have preferred to be able to turn the light off without having to almost disconnecting the housing. Ok if nothing else is available.
2,Patriarchal West Africa?,"Sorry, but I didn't say those West African societies were matriarchies -- just that they are not patriarchies, they don't fit Goldberg's statement that ""There is not, nor has there ever been, any society that even remotely failed to associate authority and leadership in suprafamilial areas with the male. There are no borderline cases.""Check of the political and social roles of the Sande secret society among the Mende, the control of Ibo and Yoruba market systems by women and and the power wielded by elite Yoruba women in the palaces. Refs available on request.Problem is, looking at these questions demands rather more care than a quick search on the Internet."
3,Bad data in review,"I am about to read the book and I noticed a previous review with bad data. Doing a quick search on the internet, I discovered that the Yoruba, Ibo, and Mende societies are/were not matriarchal.Yoruba - Less so than other societies, but definitely patriarchal. Patrilineal. Ruled by hereditary kings.Ibo - Polygynous. Women not much more than property.Mende - Patrilineal. Monotheistic. Ruled by male chiefs.In doing a quick search, I couldn't find sufficient data on the Sherbro or Asante, but I suspect I would just find the same thing."
2,Way too small for my mom,"I misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle. It isn't. Apparently, the dimensions include the packaging. She loves Wheel Of Fortune on TV, and I thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands. Very disappointing. I'll be returning it, unopened."
2,Too Tiny,"I had a friend that had this game only it was twice the size! I was very dissappointed when this came in the mail. It is so small you can hardly pick your letters on the keyboard and you need a magnifying glass to see the screen. We are sending this back. Oh and you HAVE to play agasinst the computer if you have it on 1 or 2 player - A waste of time. I am still searching for the larger model but I think this is the ""new and improved"" version. Don't waste your time with this game."
3,Good Quality,"This toy is a good value, however, I play it too and I have trouble seeing the letters and messages on the screen. I think it needs to have a larger letter size so it can be seen more clearly. Otherwise, it is a nice product."
2,Stick with Tiger,I also have had many of the problems since installation as the rest here. Productivity has dropped for me with the shiny graphics.The e mail templates are cool but I wish it would give you the option of creating your own.Time Machine is neat and I have used it often but for the reason that I have to constantly go back to retrieve a file that has been damaged or lost mysteriously.Installation was a week long nightmare when the installer stopped halfway because of a bad line of code. The whole hard drive had to be reformatted and it wouldn't get the complete saved files from the backup disk. So for a week I was hunting down missing files from back up. My suggestion is Leopard's release is a beta release and should be passed on until it becomes debugged and more stable.Russell
4,Hard to go back to a Widows PC,"Purchased a MacBook Pro so as to be able to use Keynote - what was unexpected was the pleasurable transformation of my entire computing experience - ""it just works"" is in fact the deal - the installation of Leopard as an upgrade was totally smooth and worthwhile - we will move all our computing over to the Mac platform - people simply prefer using a Mac loaded with Leopard - would give Leopard 4.5 stars - however this is not an available option - 5 stars would be perfect - and this is close - I'm convinced this is the best available operating system and of course the Apple hardware and bundled apps are very elegant."
4,Excellent upgrade,"There are a bunch of improvements here and there in this upgrade of the Mac OS. I love the great interface upgrades to the Finder in this version, especially the Quicklook preview function of your files, improved sidebar, and the fancy 3D dock. I also liked the enhancements to iChat, esp iChat theater and file sharing through iChat. Safari has some minor improvements here and there, and everything seems to run a bit speedier after upgrading. Stacks isn't very useful, though. The Mail application is great, with a variety of stationery templates to choose from where you can insert photos. I don't have a backup hard drive to test Time Machine but it sounds like a cool application. Overall, an excellent upgrade."
4,Leopard is Great but...,"Apple is the best operating system out. I have Vista Business at work and there is no comparison that Leopard is light years ahead. The ""but..."" is that all new OS's versions are ahead of existing software and even hardware. There is always a discomfort factor when adopting early - and I have learned this as a frequent early adopter. I think a lot of the new features for Leopard are practical and useful."
2,"NO customer support, Bad OS","This Operating System is a sad attempt at keeping the reigns around Apple consumers. The product does not support hardware more than ONE year old, uses a massive amount of resources and the customer support is extremely rude and bureaucratic. The program itself, if you can get it running, is no different than any other proprietary Apple product on the market. Buyer Beware!"
1,Worst Upgrade Yet,"This is by far the worst upgrade yet. I bought the most recent 10.5.4 and installed it a few days ago on my G5. It installed fine, including the X-tools. After having almost 10 years of rock solid performance from OS9, Panther, and Tiger this has been nothing but a nightmare. My G5, now with Leopard, randomly and continually crashes with Safari, Mail, iPhoto,and as well as many other programs. Even the disk utility First Aid hangs the computer. In two days now it has crashed probably twenty times. The force quit will not terminate hung programs and the computer has to be restarted with the power button. I have Disk Warrior on order to try to fix things but right now I'm seriously considering deinstalling this crap and going back to the stable Tiger. Fortunately, I have a G4 with Tiger that runs, with the same software, without problems. After being an ardent Mac supporter for many years It is very disappointing to see Apple come out with software like this."
3,Needs more kinks worked out,Leopard still has a number of bugs which can be limiting in its use compared to the very stable and bug free 10.4. Wish I had waited. So frustrating to go from trouble free to a number of issues which limit my computer use and are difficult if not possible at this time to resolve with Apple.
2,Not stable and does not seem to be any more useful,"Its not stableIts not fasterIts not anymore usefulHowever, it was cheap and its probably always good to have the latest code that would be the only reason I see to upgrade."
3,Ehhh... It's Fine.,"My laptop was running on an earlier OS and in order to watch any videos online or update much of my other software I had to update my OS t Leopard. Overall it's fine but the loss of the ""Classic Environment"" is a bummer. Also, I have been having trouble hooking up USB devices and having my computer recognize they are there."
3,Have to agree,"10.5 for myself and many was a disaster; 10.5.1/2 also. The usual problems plus too much eye candy and feature bloat.Quicklook? Spaces? a second calculator in Widgets?! Dont be adding marginally -or non uselfull things just to be able to hype. I want an enhanced (with th basics and then a few extras. Not a boatload of them) stable OS.Each time I went back to 10.4.11-stability speed-AND I COULD REPAIR PERMISSIONS IN FIFTEEN SECONDS, not FIFTEEN MINUTES. Now that Applejack is out you can see why: all kinds of bootstrap errors untill the system shrugs and moves another way. The word ""EMERGENCY""in there makes you wonder why they still leave this unfixed.I dread having to repair permissions if I add a system app. And error are listed for a reason: They are warning you of something is WRONG. APPLEs response of ""ignore it"" is why the whole thing is a messThe whole thing is a mess. Today 10.5.5 should be out-maybe that will be worth it"
2,Disappointing ... Wait ...,"As a new Mac convert (1 year on a MacBook) I was actually eagerly looking forward to Leopard largely for Time Machine - to easily and simply manage backups for our family's 4 Macs.Sadly, Apple stripped out the most important network backup functionality from Time Machine just before retail release and further ... I (and frankly many others) have found curious disk compatibility issues with Leopard and Time Machine that are reproducible and worrisome. I have several USB disks that I attempted to use with Time Machine (even after extensive reading of Apple's support forums) that are corrupted and unusable after the attempt to use with Time Machine.I remain unsuccessful in getting Time Machine to reliably work.The other features of Leopard are nice, but few are really compelling other than Time Machine.I would wait as Apple should have done .. until this product is really ready for end users."
4,Serious upgrade problems but they are resolved and OS is now great,"I LOVE the new operating system now but it was rough at first. When it was first installed (and I was one of the first to do so) it caused all sorts of problems - it disregarded the fact that my HD is partitioned and couldn't find anything on that drive (including my iTunes library), the internet was crazy slow and Acrobat wouldn't work at all, plus a handful of other problems. It was so bad we tried to downgrade back to the prior OS but found we couldn't do that either. And it's not like I was trying to put this OS on an old, out of date Mac. My Mac is only 4 months old! Within a couple of weeks Apple released some updates that fixed everything so all is well now."
4,Great upgrade!,"I read a lot about the upgrade and I was very eager to get it.The whole process takes about 2 to 3 hrs but its smooth without any issues.I installed it on my MacBook Pro and Im very happy with it.The feature I like to most is the QuickLook on Mail application which lets you view the contents of different attachments without opening the application.Overall its been a positive experience.The only thing that I was looking for and it was a bit disappointing is the Time Machine because even when it works fine, I was hoping for more options. Hopefully it will have them on a future update.Highly recommend the upgrade."
5,Great version with great new features. Time Machine is awesome!!!,"Installation is really simple and went off without a hitch. I love Time Machine, now I don't have to worry about when I last backed up. I just deleted something off my desktop and realized that I still needed it. Clicked on the Time Machine Icon, went back one hour, clicked on the item and restored that item back to the desktop. Works just like it is supposed to. Other great stuff as well, but I would have to write a book."
2,The iMac Internet for Dummies Bundle,"The content of this book is easy to understand, however, too elementary. This book is not necessarily for an i-Mac beginner, but someone who has never owned a computer."
5,Inspirational,"My favorite part of the video is his recollection of being in the pool with his daughter, and the story of ""row, row, row, your boat"". Truly inspirational!!"
3,"Good, but...","My wife and I really enjoy Wayne Dyer. The message was good, but short. There is a lot more information in the book. But,as always Wayne has a great message."
5,Be the Miracle in Someone's life,"If you have just one minute, that one minute you take can transform someone elses life.A kind word a smile. We are born alone but not here alone.We arehereto help and serve others.Giving never goes out of style."
3,a christmas gift,this was purchased as a Christmas gift and i cant wait to give it to my brother! i think he will love it; he always did as a child.
3,"A mediocre book, somewhat poorly written.","The story was uninspiring if not actually bad, and while the characterizations were handled well and the pacing and drama were not bad, the actual physical writing was poor. There was far too many sloppy grammatical errors and such for the mediocre quality of the story to make up for; I'll tolerate a certain level of sloppiness if the story is good enough, but this one just wasn't good enough. Both the plot and the quality of the writing did pick up somewhat from a very weak beginning, which is why I gave the book three stars; at first impression, I was definitely leaning toward calling this a two-star effort."
2,Disappointed,"I have bought several CDs over the last year hoping to find ""Claire de Lune"" which I first heard in a movie -""Music for Millions"" - (probably black and white). Each CD seems to have mostly the same music. Considering his long career I find that surprising;"
5,Artistic fun,"A fun,enjoyable, extraordinarily artistic performance! These are incredible musicians who make the bassoon come alive! I can't praise this album enough nor can I praise the musicality of Mark Eubanks enough. He and his colleagues need to be heard to be believed! Buy this CD."
4,Another wonderful Norton fantasy,"With this book in the series, Norton develops the complex conflict between good and evil in both the profane and ethereal realms of the world."
4,Good systematic review of Wesleyan theology,"I like the overall treatment because it covers a lot of ground fairly succinctly. Not a gripping best selling novel mind you, but it does what it needs to. In some of the later chapters her organization gets a little harder to follow, but overall a good work if you are wanting to have a solid grasp of the essentials."
4,Wife Loves It,I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She is just starting out learning about herbology and says the book is well written and the author has a good sense of humor. Accurate? not sure as I've said its our first go with herbology but it sure seems spot on.
4,A Bargain Over All,"Although I understand the negative reviews, this 50 pack is still a bargain and a great chance to see some films that aren't readily available anywhere. Although I haven't seen all fifty, I've cruised around enough to know that they are very watchable. Disc 12 may be something of a disappointment, as it's all early TV dramatic showcase programs (complete with vintage commercials), but the rest of the offerings here contain some real treasures, from King Vidor's ""Our Daily Bread"" to William S. Hart's last picture, ""Tumbleweeds."" Virtually impossible to beat at the price."
3,3-and-a-half-stars; nostalgia,"Final Fantasy Legend III (part of the Saga series in Japan, billed as Final Fantasy in the U.S. to boost sales) is actually a decent game, despite dated Mode-7 graphics and cheesy pre-GBA sounds. It's a standard 4-person-party RPG that requires some tedious leveling, equipment upgrades, and several quests across a variety of settings. The storyline had a lot of potential, and while incomplete at parts, should leave you satisfied at the end.Why the high rating for this ancient game? The game brings back a lot of memories of the old days. Is it worth playing now? If you own the game but never managed to play it, I suggest you do. If you can get a good used price, pick it up. Some of the tunes are catchy, and the gameplay is pretty smooth. Also, if you can't be bothered to upgrade your portable system to a Game Boy Advance, this is one of the best RPGs available on the Game Boy."
1,Awful,"One of the worst books on writing I've ever tried to read. Poor advice (Fed Ex your queries?? Aren't all the agents out there LAUGHING at this?) and shockingly hard to read. Strunk & White, Annie Lammott, Zissner - those top three come to mind if you're looking for REAL writing advice. For agent advice, seek out Agent Query, Absolute Write, Publisher's Marketplace, and the unparalleled Miss Snark's blog. Yes, I abandoned this before finishing. (And yes, I already have an agent.)"
3,Just okay.,"Mr. Lukeman's style is a little flowery for my taste, but the premise is excellent--how to get an agent or an editor to read beyond page five. To be fair, the first chapter sort of does this, though I didn't learn anything really new. I wish he had written the book I thought I was buying. Instead this one turns out to be just another elementary guide teaching idiots and novices how to write good."
3,A decent book on writing but not necessary for avid READERS looking to write,"I purchased this book months ago and went through the chapters. Yes, they do provide good insight on different areas of writing such as Style, Characterization, Progression, Dialogue, etc. However, I would say that about 95% of the stuff this book told me was stuff that I already knew just from reading so many books (and I'm not talking about writing guides...I'm talking fiction novels). If you're an avid reader, you naturally pick the proper technicalities of proper writing. It starts to become natural to you. So basically everything THE FIRST FIVE PAGES told me, I had already picked up just from reading novels. This is a good book for those who are trying out writing for the first time and may not read as often. However, reading lots of books is a learning tool in itself."
3,Good text,"You can learn from everything. This is a good text. I don't believe it's as good as Elmore Leonards ""10 rules of Writing."" Leonard covers the same material more concisely."
4,"A great book about writing, and not just the first 5 pages",I found this book to be a great primer about what makes an entire book readable- not just the first five pages. The information in this short book will make your book even better. It was money well spent.
1,"Don't be wordy, gosh what great advice",I thought that this book would be a sophisticated look at how to grab an editor. Instead the first chapter deals with eliminating unnecessary adjectives and adverbs---this is writing 101. It takes a great deal more than than basics like this to get published. A total waste of money.
5,What I always bring to a (kid's) party!,"This is my favorite CD for a sing-a-long with my 16 month old daughter. She never gets tired of it and, most unusual, I can listen to it ad infinitum longer than any other kid's CD.Toddler is also my favorite gift to bring to a birthday party. It never fails to please."
3,I couldn't finish it.,"This is a well written book and at first, I was captivated. The mystery was interesting, I liked the protagonist, and the ""paranormal"" occurences were treated with a healthy amount of skepticism. Then, towards the end, the author got carried away with his own cleverness. The identity of the killer changes 3 times, and each time I found the killer's motivation harder to understand. Not a bad book, I just don't need a big ""surprise"" ending."
2,"Get a Life, Nick!","I'm not convinced. I tried to like this, I really did. Nick needs to get out of his reverie and make some music that indicates he is still alive. I enjoyed ""Dig my Mood"", but enough is enough! Think about many of the wonderful songs he has written. There's only 2 or 3 songs on here that are in the least bit memorable, and I've heard most everything Nick has ever done. People are much too generous with their stars in these customer reviews. 4 stars?? Listen to all his music and you can't give this 4 stars."
4,"Just Before ""Quiet Storm"" Broke","Chuck Loeb has always gotten great tone out of his ax - mellow, hollow, and clean, in ways similar to Lee Ritenour, Pat Metheny, and recently Martin Taylor. Nothing revolutionary here, just good playing, and not much ""Quiet Storm"" - the bane of recent radio-friendly jazz. Here with Peter Erskine, Russell Ferrante (of the Yellowjackets), and Will Lee, ""Simple Things"" (along with ""Balance"") showcases Chuck Loeb."
5,Will never eat veal.,"I saw the 2nd half of this movie on cable and then it was never on again (when I could catch it). I like the female star from ""To Die for"" with Nicole Kidman. The unexpected outcome of this movie--I won't give it away-- caused me to put this on reserve. I had to wait for it to come out on DVD. It does not have captioning, but the dialogues are not a problem. My husband was not impressed, but I guess I am more of a dreamer about love. It is for special tastes only."
5,Don't go without this book!,"This book was incredibly helpful. I just got back from a week in Amsterdam, and ""Get Lost"" was my constant companion - helped me find places to eat, smoke, get cash - everything. I love this book!"
3,CENSORED 2006,"This is an important book series which unfortunately has been infiltrated by the so-called ""truthers"" who believe the mainstream press have ignored the evidence of 9/11 being an ""inside job."" The fact of the matter is that this is easily disproved by the fact that by 2006 the Bush administration was on the ropes poitically and the handwriting was on the wall after the Democratic wins in Congress, and yet there was no new terrorist attack which would have renewed the political power of the Bush administration and insured Republican victory in the 2008 Presidential election. I dislike the Bush administration as much as anyone, but 9/11 happened because they were incompetent. The FBI had warned Bush 5 weeks before 9/11 that there was evidence of an attack being planned, but Bush responded by going on vacation. Clearly the Bush adminstration took political advantage of the attacks, but they didn't engineer them or we'd have a Republican President now."
4,it works,"it works well, the only reason why its not 5 stars is because sometimes it can be a little hard to get your pugs in and out of the 2 sockets, other than that it works great!"
5,wiring is fine on mine,"I was concerned from reviews that said the wiring was reversed, so I bought one and checked it. It was wired correctly and works great! So I ordered 2 more."
1,The Nightmare Before Christmas (and 6 weeks after),"I ordered these before Christmas as a present for my wife, but, to my dismay, Adorama sent a model with a tacky gold trim (rather than the advertised silver trim). I returned the merchandise, and, incredibly, they sent the same gilded model again! I returned it again, they now say they have no record of the return and refuse to ship a replacement. Bottomline: I paid for a pair of opera glasses, plus about twice that amount for shipping, spent hours on the phone, and received - nothing."
5,Excellent Author Imagination!,Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse is an excellent book. The story development and educational message is very outstanding. Great Job Kevin Henkes!
5,awesome trio,This is some of the best trio playing I have heard. They stretch the boundries and are truly playing from the soul. This group should be much more well known than they are. I am certainly spreading the name in my area of Detroit. I just wish they would play live here sometime. I wish them all the best.
3,Subtitles?,"Are subtitles available? I've been waiting a long time for this to come out, but if there are no Spanish subtitles I won't buy it. I live in Costa Rica, and I hate the look of disappointment when a guest looks through my DVDs and finds one in which they're strongly interested, only to be told there are no subtitles.I can understand not dubbing a film - that's expensive. But how much can it cost to add subtitles? I know it can't be too much. Considering the quality of some translations one gets the impression that one guy spent the afternoon typing out the Spanish as he watched the movie a couple of times."
3,"Prequel to ""Color of Money""","This film is so old it is in Black and White. Despite being very early in Paul Newman's career, he is already showing his ability as an actor. I had some trouble fully relating to the era being depicted as it was before my time. Still, the story has a plot and this movie makes a good background for ""Color of Money"". It has some other big-name actors in it, like Jackie Gleason, playing Minnesota Fats."
1,Great dissapointment,"Boring tale about neurotic phonies in a neurotic phony world.Waste of acting talents and photography.The music in the jazz scene is described by the subtitles as ""Dixieland jazz"". If that is so, I am King of France."
4,nice pool playing,"Paul Newman and especially Piper Laurie's acting are outstanding, but pool playing is really was steals the plot. I was hoping that most of the playing was done by Paul Newman but it seems like it has been dubbed quite a bit. The plot is a bit long, and women played by female actresses were treated badly in those times. Overall, it is entertaining and interesting, although I wouldn't have qualified it as a cult movie that it has become, who knows why."
4,Clever rhyming verse with fun buggling eyes,"We enjoy this book. The rhyme is funny for kids and entertaining for grownups. If you want to read a book with clever rhymes, here you go. The only reason the book lost a star for me is that the plastic bug eyes get a bit scratched up after a while.My caution to you is that you can't really read this book while lying down as the eyes roll back. It's kind of boring looking at white balls where the eyes should be. You have to sit up. I like to gently wiggle the book so the eyes roll all around while we're reading. It makes the kids laugh and makes it look like the bug's really feeling what's being written.All in all, a cute book, clever rhyme, outstanding illustrations, and a fun way to read with your kids."
5,Funny Bugs,I bought this book for a child and then realized how much it would appeal to adults with a sense of humor. I am planning to give it to my daughter-in-law who will laugh and then read it to my two granddaughters who will also laugh.
4,Great Album!,"While the voice, at some points, is a little bit abrasive and annoying, the musical talent exhibited by these youths is certainly evident. I must disagree that the lyrics are ""juvenille""; just because a 12-year-old refuses to conform to the norms of love songs does not mean his words lack complexity or wit. Each song on the album is catchy and has a cool riff, and Newsted is a great addition on the bass. I must add that each song is in a different key, possibly in the style of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier. Thus, the album has great replay value, due to the non-tedious nature of the keys.I heart the Moss Bros, and sincerely hope they get back together soon. I wonder how Reuben is doing. He must be in his junior year of high school by now? Wow, crazy how this generation grows up so fast!"
1,I don't get it,"I get that these are kids. They are talented, but... those vocals are painful, really painful. Why do they sing the songs when they cannot hit all the notes? Maybe the CD is good for people who do not listen to a lot of music, but for me, it does not work. I;ll be interested in hearing them in six years, but for now, I'll use the CD for a coaster."
4,Good resource,"I bought this for a third level Spanish course. It has most verbs at least listed, and for verbs that are not conjugated, it direct you to a verb conjugated in the same way. I held back to four stars because it is missing some of the verbs I needed for class. A resource such as this should at least cover beginner Spanish. I still recommend it."
1,Poor Kindle Edition of a fine book,I was sorely disappointed in the Kindle edition. The font size on the charts cannot be increased. It is so small that it cannot be read. I will have to purchase a magnifier for my Kindle. This is a waste of money.
2,Typos NOT GOOD!,"I've always loved these books, as I have the Spanish and the French 501 verbs. However, today I was studying for Spanish and I turned to page 133 to memorize how ""conocer"" is conjugated in the present subjunctive and I found a typo. The ""yo"" form of ""conocer"" in present subjunctive is spelled as ""conozco."" This is not correct, that is how it is spelled in the present tense. It should be conjugated as ""conozca"" Tisk, tisk. They really ought to be more careful. Now I'm wondering just how many ""typos"" there are in these books...."
3,"Good, but not my type.","501 was extroidernary (Excuse me if I spelled that wrong) but it confused me a little. It helped, which is its purpose, but Im a little rough. The book was great, but not my type. I like easier things, stuff thats kind of step-by-step. Overall, terrific."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Fully aware the book was entitled Study Guide, prior to purchasing it I peeped inside. Pages indicated this is an actual reading book as opposed to just a study guide. Since you cannot see the whole book, I was under the impression that the study guide part was at the end of the book. Upon receipt, I was somehwhat diasppointed and my first instinct was to return it. After a little thought, I decided to keep it and simply order Rediscovering Kingdom Worship which prayerfully goes along with the study guide and can be used for my reading pleasure as well as in conjunction with this study guide. Gave it a 3 rating but cannot fairly rate book until I receive Kingdom Worship and have the opportunity to use study guide."
4,Delivers,"On the cover of the album they're calling it the ""Future sound of Los Angeles"". But when you read the small print inside it's clear the bulk of this music comes from Italy -- 11 out of the 14 tracks. Nine of the 14 were written or produced by ""Joe T."" Vannelli. (And the DJ Eddie Amador has lived in LA for only 2 years.) Besides the tacky marketing, the CD is prone to go into tacky spots from time to time in the music itself -- like House music overall. But it's got the Garage beat and the Garage keyboards that this customer digs. They do say on the cover that it's Garage.Amazon.com's listing, above, of what's on the CD appears to have errors, e.g., it lists five tracks by Csilla (an alias for Vannelli & friends) whereas my CD lists only 3 by Csilla. My favorite track, #3, has these credits: ""Written by B. Guerrini / M. Lissoni. Produced by Bruno Guerrini. ... Courtesy of JT Company. Italy."" The stars in the night."
3,More of the Same,"Cake's first release for Columbia Records, Comfort Eagle, is more of the same from this Sacramento quintet. Their rhythmic pop is skewed just enough to maintain interest on its fourth full length. It helps that Joel McCrea chooses quirky subject matter for his songs - the life of a classical composer (""Commissioning a Symphony in C""), modern transportation (""Long Line of Cars""), the inner mind of a novelist (""Shadow Stabbing"") - because the music is overly familiar if not outright stolen (""Short Skirt/Long Jacket"" should share a composition credit with Lou Reed as it's based on the riff to ""Sweet Jane""). McCrea's dry monotone doesn't grate, though there are times when his blasé phrasing ill-serves his own often wicked lyrics. Not bad, and certainly no breakthrough - more a holding pattern of their own modest ambitions."
4,...Nails that shine like Justice...,"This is Cake's most polished album. The production value here is far beyond Cake's other albums, with only Prolonging the Magic coming close. As a huge fan of the band, one of the things that I've always loved about them is the rough, almost live sound that most of the tracks on each of their previous albums possessed (especially Motorcade of Generosity). Comfort Eagle is something entirely different, and by different I don't mean bad. The wonderful bass lines that are signature Cake are still in full effect, the clever lyrics are here, the great vocals and backing vocals still shine. Cake took its one-of-a-kind sound and built on it, making an album that will not only please fans they've had for years, but also reach out to people who may not be as familiar with their work. It's a superb album and an absolute pleasure to listen to."
3,Pleasantly Mediocre; Absolutely Wonderful,"If you are a cake enthusiast, are obsessed, and have listened for a long time, this cd will seem average. For the first timer, though, it will seem awesome. This is the most mainstream of all Cake's albums. All the songs are fun to sing along to, and play at the beach and in your car. Once you delve deeper into cake, after this basically introductory cd, you will come to know and love their older stuff. Their other albums are just pure gold. Buuuut, the outstanding songs on this cd from a cake-begginner's point of view are: Short Skirt, Long Jacket; Comfort Eagle; Opera Singer (if you can get past what will seem like bizarre lyrics, which you will soon understand as a metaphor). After that, though, try Symphony in C, Long Line of Cars, and meanwhile rick james. Then buy ALL THEIR CD'S!! Only the truly ignorant will dislike cake, the greatest band of all time."
5,Brilliant,"This album is simply brilliant. Much better than the overrated ""Fashion Nugget.""The lyrics are tremendously satirical, written with such musicality and wit that you can't help but admire them. ""Comfort Eagle"" has to be one of the best songs I've heard in my life, with their spectacular lyrics and stomping riffs, and even the creepy hand clapping. Other highlights are ""Meanwhile, Rick James..."", ""Opera singer"", ""Short skirt/long jacket"", ""Shadow stabbing"" and ""Comissioning a symphony in C.""One of the most underrated bands ever."
3,An acceptable follow up.,"Comfort Eagle is not as good as Fashion Nugget. On the other hand it still retaines all of the major elemnts that Cake fans need, ironic lyrics, a great bass line, and slight country, and funk influeces, just little enough to keep from hating it."
3,Cake Without That Twang That I Grew To Love,"This album had me wondering what the next album is going to be like. Considering the fact that Cake seems to be moving away from that country influenced rock sound that they perfected so well. Now it just seems to be a money making record to satisfy the needs of everybody's enjoyment of the 2.5 minute wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am pop song craze. There are a few tracks that actually have a bit of that familiar cake sound, Comfort Eagle and Arco Arena have that vintage cake sound, as does Long Line of Cars and Commissioning a Symphony in C. The album isn't bad either, I was just hoping for something a little closer to thier roots than this. The songs on this album are very catchy though. Meanwhile Rick James... and Shadow Sitter are probably the best two tracks here, followed closely by World of Two. Overall this cd is good, but if you want that Fashion Nugget sound I'm here to tell you ""Don't get your hopes up."""
2,Lasts for 18-24 Months And Then It's Done!,"Do your research and you will find a number of reviewers across the internet (including myself) reporting that this product works for 18 to 24 months and then the most used buttons wear out and you will find yourself frustrated, annoyed, and out several hundred bucks. It was great for awhile, but now at the 2 year mark, I have to spend another $300-$400 for a new remote. Thanks Universal!"
1,Keypad fails after 2 years,"For a remote this expensive, the keypad should not wear out after 2 years. A quick search of the Internet shows that others have complained about the keypad failing. This isn't a cleaning issue, instead the actual contact pads wear out on the most commonly used buttons and eventually fails completely. The manufacturer will replace for $125, but when beter remotes like the Logitech Harmony One exist for $199, it's mnot worth the effort. I would stronly urge people considering this remote to do research before making the investment, as a remote of this price should last."
1,needs additional software,"I purchased the MX-900 from Firewall LLC, not realizing that the remote control needed additional software to program it. According to the directions in MX-900's pamphlet, the software needs to be downloaded from an ""authorized seller"" as it is not available from the remote control's manufacturer's website. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a place to download it for free. Amazon's response was to send me to a website that would program the remote control for me for even more money. So, long and short of it is, I was never able to see if the remote control worked properly because I was not able to program it. Other sellers may have the software available- make sure of this before you buy it!"
2,So dumb,I had really hoped that this game would be like SIMS 3. However it isn't at all like that. It's weird. And the plot is stupid. And it being on Nintendo DS the graphics suck so bad. Just save your money.
4,The Sims 2 for DS,"This game is fun in the beginning, when you have missions and different needs to accommodate. It's somewhat open-ended, but after the ""end"" happens there's not too much to do. Getting to the end is fun though and I think the chances you'll want to play it over again some day are pretty high, which counts for something."
4,Amazing - a History of Korea you can't put down!,"What's it like to rediscover your roots in an ancient culture half a world away from home?That's what happens to the American narrator of this novel when she visits Korea, the land of her mother's birth, determined to find a hidden temple built by her grandfather as a monument to a lost heritage.Along the way we hear the voices of mother and grandfather, retelling the tragic story of 20th Century Korea. Through these tales we come to understand the dramatic effects of history on the lives of one family. As the narrator seeks out the hidden temple she discovers Korea and more than that, herself.I visited Korea a few years ago, and this book brought it all back to me. 1,000 Chestnut Trees is definitely the most accessible way of learning about the country. Which is remarkable since its also a superb, page-turner of a novel."
5,No Complaints,"For the oh so low price i paid, combined with the pretty fast shipping...what more could i ask for? Only thing that could have been different is there be some tracking info next time. I do plan to return to but more manuals though."
4,Rodney Carrington,"Rodney is funny as always. Best on this CD is towards the end in a segment entitled, ""Show Them to Me!"" This material, as with all of his material, is NOT for kids!"
2,to fast for zapper,"I bought this game for my girlfriend, the only way to get the game to play is to take out 3 of the 4 gigs of memory that is in the computer.I have tried this on 3 different computers and anything over a gig of memory and it will not play.I am running WinXP Home,It is a cute game but not worth the hassle if your computer has more then a gig of memory."
4,EPSON BELIEVER,Great print. Renewed my confidence in EPSON. Ink consumption is reasonable. OK with me.
2,Cheap Junk,"This printer is junk! Bzzzz, Brrp, zzzzzzeeeesz . . . noises like that nearly everytime you turn it on as it charges it's cartridges. I also have an HP printer, quiet, always working, never having to make those awful and annoying charging noises."
1,Huge disappointment,"I have had nothing but problems with my Epson 740. The printing quality is lousy, it frequently crashes my computer and support stinks. Don't waste your money."
2,Dependable Up to a Point,"Overall this was a dependable printer for a while, but it has a glitch that causes the return carriage to get stuck. In other words you may be getting warranty work soon. The paper feeding function is less than smooth. If you're on a cheap budget this might be a good buy but understand that getting warranty work is not fun."
1,Same (bad) experience as many,This printer worked OK for about two years. The print quality was acceptable for color and black & white. But the big thing is that it died. It doesn't work at all now. This seems to be the trend among the reviews I've seen. Based on the other reviews I'm going to go with a Canon.
4,Happy at work,I purchased this toy as an ornament on my desk at work. I didn't realize how many features it had to play with. Being a big kid myself yet I find myself showing the features to people who walk in to my office. They think it is very cool also.
1,"Cheap plastic, breaks easy",Don't waste your money. The forks break easy and then you will have a sad child on your hands
4,Do you like forklifts?,"Do you or your child like forklifts? Well, then this is the toy for you! I gave it to my 3 year old, so it remains to be seen how durable it truly is, but the initial reaction has been good. It is a good size and the interchangeable forks work very well. It tilts and lifts just like a real forklift."
4,Good toy,My 2.5yr old loves it! My only complaint is that the forks cac come off. I foresee them getting lost.
3,A bit disappointing,"This book is beautifully bound and the color reproductions seem accurate. But I was disappointed by the uniformity of Twachtman's work. Supposedly at the threshold between impressionism and modernism, his work nevertheless seems flaccid, lackluster, and incredibly uniform, as if he were painting as a past time. This is more obvious if you see his work in succession and not piecemeal in an assortment of art history books (which describes my previous exposure to his work). Given the aura of mystery surrounding Twachtman I was somewhat surprised and disappointed. I suspect an element of mythmaking augmented his career. However, there are some beautiful paintings in this volume and if you are a hardcore devotee of Twachtman and already familiar with his work you will probably love this book."
2,dead but not forgotten,"Held up well for 2 years, but now needs a $300 repair, so ordered a new reconditioned one. I guess thats not a bad run, was well used!"
2,Too dry to read,This book is more of a manual than the traditional concept of a book. No real life examples of the subject discussed. No easy or hard exercises to enforce the material the student went over.All you see is a collection of abstract concepts to a subject that can be very interesting. This is definitely not worth the amount of money I spent.
1,Don't Purchase!,"This was the worst piece of junk I have ever bought. This item should not be sold to anyone. It took 5 hours to put together and its just cheap all around. I should have gone to Ikea, I would have paid less and got better quality. As soon as I can ship this junk back I am. Take it from me don't purchase! I am very disappointed!"
1,I NEVER EVER received it,I NEVER EVER received it and the seller didn't acknowledged my request to send to me; I told them and proved I did not get it or sign for it and gave her a mailing address to send to where someone could sign for it. This is clearly theft by deception
4,Good after lastest patch but tough,"loving europa universallis and loving WWII i thought this game would be great. it is pretty good but it is extremly difficult. if im an allied nation the nazis win, if im the axis the allies win. the tech tree is huge and it is really in depth with micro managment. if your a fan of europa universallis i suggest you get it. if you are new to this genre of game i suggest you try it out first. if you hated europa your gonna hate this."
1,"Good idea, poor attempt","While I am a fan of complicated strategy games, and would love to recommend this game, I found it to be extremely buggy. I am using the latest patch (1.02) and still experience random crashes and broken features."
3,Buy a bigger version,"Don't buy this little book--buy it in a bigger version. The write-up didn't give a description of its very tiny size. It has very good pictures, but BIG trucks should have BIG PICTURES."
2,Very Poor Fit,"The fit is very narrow in the foot and lower leg. Also, size runs small in general - I am a women's size 6.5-7 shoe, I ordered size 7-8 and it was short. Had to return them. AND the return process was difficult."
5,Ask and it is Given by Abraham-Hicks,"Ask and it is Given is a tremendous book. Although many people take channeled information with a pinch of salt, once you read the real wisdom in these pages, you will realize the value of the infromation given. Ester Hicks,channeling Abraham, can be seen on the internet in many locations. I suggest checking these out to get a real handle on the books purpose.If you have read the Secret and are wondering why it isn't working - read this - it will give you the missing piece to the puzzle."
4,In other words....,"Don't get me wrong. I really liked the book. I truly believe in The Law of Attraction and this is a great guide. It delves into the concept of The Secret thoroughly and gives some great exercises to do. However, whoever edited this book should be ashamed. If I read the phrase ""...in other words..."" one more time, I was definitely going to lose my serenity and my vibrations would certainly turn negative. That, and the phrase ""revert back"". There is no such term in the English language, and is always a sign to me of poor editing. If, in every case, the phrase ""in other words"" was taken out the text would flow better and not as irritating."
5,Life changing,Esther's explanation about where she gets the information provided in this book may be off-putting for some people. But I love the message no matter where it comes from. I've read this book more times than any other book I've owned in my entire life. I learned a ton about Universal Law of Attraction and the power of my thoughts. I recommend this book to any open-minded person with a desire to have more joy in life.
5,Classic & Consistent with Living On Purpose,"I consider this book a classic when it comes to explaining the law of attraction is a simple and practical way. This book is both inspirational and useful, especially the second half of the book which gives very simple and practical ways to tap into the power of attraction. It's also very much aligned with living on purpose which is one of the reasons I included a chapter inLife on Purpose: Six Passages to an Inspired Life. After all, clarifying your life purpose, while an important part of living a satisfying and fulfilling life, the real joy comes in designing your life to be a reflection of your life purpose.That's where the law of attraction comes into play and where this book can be such a valuable adjunct to living a life on purpose. You'll also learn that the law of attraction isn't just about attracting more stuff into your life. It's really about attracting joy, wisdom, and fulfillment as well."
1,The creepiest book I've ever opened. I threw it away instantly.,"Psycho lady meditated and her nose spelled out a name. She started typing what she thought the name of the ""spirit"" was saying. I believe in the Law of Attraction and I believe that weirdo's do to. It's a Law like gravity. This is just creepy and weird. If you're looking for spiritual guidance then for God's sake listen to Jesus."
1,Bought it and denounced it! Anything that deals with Spirit Guides is an opening for demonic deception,"Once I got to the part about Aberaham coming as a personal spirit guidesent RED WARNING FLAGs flying-I think this book is a deception-If you really want answers to your prayers then just ask and pray to JesusJesus said"" ask and it will be given to you""of coarse you need to read the scripture a bit further in the bible to get the whole gist of this asking and recieving. However bottom line ALL GOOD THINGS COME FROM GOD and things not given by God may look good for a while and then they may go bad!Jesus is the only way!"
5,Handbook for Living a Created Life,I first read this book in the Spring of 2010. It is now in my Top 5 list of my all time fav books. If you are curious about how to get unstuck and actually live the life you envision in your mind's eye — read this book and reference it often!
1,This toy does not work!,My son received this toy for his birthday. It's cheaply made and extremely loud. We put new batteries into it and they did not give the cars enough power to go. The only value of this toy is the fact you can play with the vehicles without the launcher. It is not worth the money.
3,Very rough on the top of the foot,"Seems like it should be a good boot. I have owned several similar boot by Timberland, but this one the laces and tongue just cut in the top of the foot.At least that is my experience, but each foot is different."
4,So far these are the best pair of boots I have owned.,So far these are the best pair of boots I have ever owned. However I have yet to hike or submerge them.
5,Great everyday work boots!,"This is the second pair of these boots that I have purchased. The last pair lasted for about 5 years of daily use in construction; rain or shine, snow or summer heat. They always kept my feet dry and provided comfortable support. I would recommend them to anyone. Great boots at a really good price."
2,Timberland White Ledge did not live up to their name,I do not have a problem with Amazon they returned the first pair of these boots becasue they were not waterproof as stated in the product information. The second pair is not waterproof as well. If you are looking for a boot that you can use in the field please look for other brand. This boot is a boot that you can use for work around the house on a sunny day but not a boots built for field use.
5,Super Boot,"I have been buying this hiking boot for several years and will continue. The price on line can't be beat. The boot is comfortable and light, great in the Mtn's. where I live and I ware them year round. A recommended buy by me."
1,poor construction,I wore these boots one day to work and on the second morning when tying the right boot the grommet at the mid stress point just popped out. I had a pair of hiking boots in the 70's as a Boy Scout that did the same thing. After a couple of returned pairs my parents moved on to something else. I will be doing the same. You would think that any shoe mfg would know that a 1/8 inch rivet through the outer leather upper will not hold. The two upper loop/grommets do go through the entire thickness of the upper and have substantial heads.
3,Kate Winslett in the Buff,An Australian film that exposes Kate to the fullest. A strong performanceby Harvey Kietel. Worth seeing.
4,"from a ""cult"" member...","I don't have time to write much now, but wish to comment. I had to see this movie because I myself have a living Indian guru. The writer and director of this story was quite successful in portraying the emotion of the experience of receiving shaktipat from a guru, and indeed, it can be a transformative experience if it is from a true guru. My husband and I cried when Ruth's third eye was opened, recalling our own experiences. Although Ruth does not end up returning to her guru, she does return to India, with her mother, no less, to continue on her way. This suggests that the guru in the story was not a cult leader. She received true shaktipat and healing which not only sustained her through her ordeal with PJ, but also transforms and heals PJ from his own personal traumas. The end was truly beautiful example of divine forgiveness. Thank you Jane, what a pleasure!"
5,more flesh,this album and long live the new flesh are awesome. someone needs to give this album the treatment that long live the new flesh got. remaster it and add bonus tracks. should include the b-side 'bloodshot moon'
4,Great for Mac OS X too!,"The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit.This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time. I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers.You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead. You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit)."
1,"Bad, Pointless Book","I had wanted to read Jane Smiley's work for some time so I picked this book up at the airport as an impulse buy. Boy, was I sorry. It is long, tedious, pointless and a waste of time. The characters are cliched and without nuance. I was very disappointed."
1,One star is too many,Unlike many others I didn't have the good sense to throw this book in the trash where it belongs. I read every last page and now I'm feeling foolish.
1,Hollywood will probably make a movie out of it...,"This was a gruelling read. I know it was supposed to be a satire, but aren't satires supposed to be humorous? It took me weeks to slog through it...I should have visited this site after the first chapter to save time, because I kept thinking, something has got to happen, right? I could have found out from the reviews that nothing ever would. Lots of deep (boring, inane) dialogue from a gathering of artsy, vegan boores...somebody in Hollywood will probably write a screenplay and make a movie out of it, which would be the next logical step, because it would fit right in with most of the garbage that Hollywood serves up these days. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Failed to hold my attention,"I agree with previous reviewers that this book totally failed to hold my attention. About 150 pages into it, I am completely bored. I have rarely put down a book without finishing it, but this book will likely remain unfinished. The characters are typical Hollywood stereotypes with nothing new or interesting to say - I kept waiting for something to draw me in, but it never happened. Totally disappointing."
2,Ten Days in the Hills,"I have been struggling to figure out why an author of Jane Smiley's stature would write a book like this. I find the characters to be the most vacuous bunch of people and I couldn't care less about any of them. I find the sex to be completely gratuitous and while I share Ms. Smiley's political views, they seem like an anti-war rant. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Unreadable,"I picked this book up in hopes of an intelligent but entertaining summer read. It failed miserably on all counts, and after suffering through ""days"" one, two, and three, I am heave-hoing this into the recycling bin, regretful only that I wasted my money on this misguided diatribe (certainly not that I missed out on days four through ten). As other reviewers have noted, the characters are dull, the lonnng political/naval gazing conversations even more so (think you've been cornered into painfully boring cocktail party conversation? -- you haven't seen anything until you've read this), and for Jane Smiley fans -- this book in no way delivers on the promise of her earlier books. It's not even a guilty pleasure, as it is absent both qualifications. But hey, if you're a fan of root canals, water torture, or being pelted with rotten vegetables, you might enjoy this."
4,a not so guilty pleasure,"I really enjoyed this book and am somewhat taken aback by all the hate it's getting on Amazon. The novel's a big, sexy joy to read. What's not to like?Well, to answer that, two things. I didn't feel like I learned much about the lives of the Hollywood upper crust that I didn't already know, and the lectures about Iraq got kind of heavy-handed and pointless. If there was some kind of thematic tissue between the plot of Taras Bulba and the war in Iraq other than war is a major drag, I missed it.But the characters were awesome as was the writing, and more than made up for it. Recommended lusty summer read!"
3,"Yes, the sex is good, but the story is tedious.","An intense story of the interactions of ten people who spend ten days together at a luxurious home in the Los Angeles Hills. They have connections with each other and bring years of baggage to the encounter. The topic of discussion for the bulk of the story is the Iraq War and that becomes tedious. Smiley does a good job of weaving the interelationships between the various family members into a moderately interesting story, but even the intense sex is not enough to save the 400+ page book. Karen Matarangas"
5,Alto flute produces very mellow tone.,"Of all Ali Ryerson's releases, this is my favorite. It's probably because the tunes are standards, but the mellow tone of the alto flute and the blend with the guitar's sound make it especially easy on the ears."
2,Low quality item,"The length was just right for my setup, but unfortunately it also introduces a lot of noise into the signal.Not sure if this cable is solely responsible for that, but it looks and feels like a low quality design."
4,Loses quality over long distance,"Worked well, but sound quality dropped over the long distance - 25 feet. Cables fit in as expected and it arrived promptly."
3,Not For Low Sodium Receipes,"I purchased this hoping that since it was written by American Heart Association, that it would not only have healthy meals in minutes, but that the meals would also have low sodium. Some receipes do, but not really what the purpose of this book is for, more for low fat. Still has tasty recipes though & is a keeper."
3,Too much canned soup in this book,"There are several great recipes in this book. The disappointing aspect of the book is that many of the recipes rely on already prepard/processed foods (i.e. canned cream soup, etc...) True, the recipes call for the 'lower-sodium' version of the soups, but, to try and be healthy, eating all the chemical crud that's in these soups seems like a dumb idea. So, while there are many recipes that I'll make (modifying the recipes to use non-prepared/processed foods), I probably won't buy any more of the AHA cookbooks."
2,Another No-Pics-At-All,"Another recipe book without ANY pictures. Recipes might be very good, but I can not agree with any recepe books without pictures."
2,Not worth the money,"I'm a soccer junkie, and I suppose I did get my fix. But this product did not blow me out of the water, and as such, recieves 2 stars.1) It's expensive ($30).2) 2 hours long. For the $ should have gotten a double DVD with at least 3 hours, I figure.3) Broadcast-quality picture. Not DVD-caliber. Imagine my angst.4) UK bias in the reporting and time appropriation.5) Got the 'Highlights' on purpose -- wanted to follow the storylines. If I wanted all the Goals, I would have gotten the 'Goals' DVD.Be ready for lotsa Spice Boy facetime + goals. That's all this Eurotrash has."
5,For Cat lovers and Irish drinkers =),"I subscribe to Marc Gunn's podcasts, and had heard one or two of the songs from this CD. I am a cat lover, I love good folk music, and I enjoy musical parody. This delightful CD fits all of those things.It won't be for everyone, but if you have a cat/love cats and enjoy silly songs, you will enjoy this one."
1,for the love of god,"Unlike Mr Tired-ree, I will not go on and on. Hated it. Where's the plot? Do bookstore owners get a kick back for recommending these books or what? Good thing I know that books are RETURNABLE. I have this book in one hand and the receipt in the other, and I'm heading back to Hue Man to try and salvage some of my hard earned money. Guess I'll have to eat the gas. Paging Terry McMillan, come in Ms. McMillan..."
1,KEEP YOUR MONEY,"This book I am sorry to say was not very well thought out, the charecters and the plot did not flow; it was a struggle just to get through the first chapter. Please KEEP your money!!!! The most upsetting thing about the novel is that I lost my receipt and am not able to return it to the bookstore!!!!!"
1,Straight up WHACK!,"I'm sorry Mr. Tyree, but this book was awful. It took me about two weeks to read it, when the average ""good read"" can be knocked out in three days tops. The only reason why I finished it was because I kept thinking it would get better after awhile. It never did. Since this was a sequel to ""Fly Girl"", I thought it would be ""the bomb."" But instead, it turned out to be a dud. For those who want to try their luck and read it anyway, I'd be glad to GIVE you my copy. For real."
2,Just Knew It,"I just knew this was going to be another bad book. I can't understand how this man gets publised,all his books are horrible.This book had alot of people waiting to see what happens to Tracy. But this book could have been so much better than it was it's not even funny. She kept saying it was soooo hard for her to make it, when everything was damn there handed to her. The way the book ended, it had me in a uproar. I'm just mad I spent $20 something for it. When I could have gotten a good book."
1,Sorry,This book was not good at all. I don't like anything about this book except the fact that Tracy had grown up and that her and Raheema were still friends after all these years. This book just did not hold my attention. Like for instance one part in the book when Tracy went into the mall and this salesgirl and her just clicked and Tracy said that she was going to help her out. I was waiting on her to help her out. I'm mad that I spent $20 on this book. I could have been ALOT better. I wish that I could give a half star. Sorry Omar.
1,IF THIS WAS A MOVIE...,"THIS WOULD BE TWO RUNGS BELOW...I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN A MOVIE BAD ENOUGH TO COMPARE THIS TO. THE NEXT BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""FLYY GIRL: THE APOLOGY."" HATED IT LIKE I DO THE CRAMPS... BUT AT LEAST THE CRAMPS KEEP MY ATTENTION. LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE SAID, I'M ON THE WAY OUT THE DOOR, THIS BOOK IN ONE HAND, MY RECEIPT IN THE OTHER. IF ANYBODY ELSE FEELS THE SAME WAY, WE CAN CARPOOL BACK TO THE SHRINE OF THE BLACK MADONNA."
1,Disappointed!!,This book was the worse book that I have read. The worse part about it is that I brought it intead of getting it from the libary. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! I wish I would have.
1,"Sad, really, really sad!","I read Flyy Girl and really liked it so I couldn't wait to get my copy of For the Love of Money. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe my expectations were set too high, but what I didn't expect was to feel ripped off! What happened to a plot of any kind? I agree with the other reviewers. For the Love of Money just lacks any kind of substance. Next time I'll check out the reviews first before I buy."
1,Refund Please,"I really tried hard to read this book. However, I was unsuccessful. After forcing to reading several chapters, Tyree did not develop an interest in his character for readers to keep turning pages. I guess after reading books by Rochelle Alers and Eric Jerome Dickey, you have high expectations from the next author. For the love of money was a major turn off from Omar Tyree. My recommendation is that an excerpt of the book should be available for readers so they won't be as disappointed as I was if they decide to purchase a copy."
1,Fly Gril Returns?,"Omar, why didn't you keep her in hidding????? You have a lot to learn about sequels! I hope you read this review...I don't know what the hell to review! This story SUCKED big time. Thats the bottom line here. PLEASE people SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you check my review history, you'll see I've reviewed a lot of books. I have nothing to say about this crap. The book is over 300 pages of nothing! I have never been tortured like that before in my life.Omar, you amused us with Flyy Girl. I loved Tracy back then and I could identify with her...I have no idea of who she is now! What a let down!"
1,"If You Love Your Money, Don't BUY This Book","I will not bash Brother Tyree as a writer. His skills are not lacking at all. There just wasn't anything else we so feverishly needed to know about the main character. Some things are better left unsaid, or in this case; unread. Not everyone can crank out a masterpiece everytime they go out for one. I have to say that I have never been so disappointed. The dialogue was strained. The characters, including Raheema (my favorite from Flyy Girl) had no depth. The main character almost made me hate her completely with her numerous self-contradictions. It was almost as if the writer couldn't decide if he wanted her to BE fly or PLAY at being fly. Nonetheless, I will continue to be on the lookout for more of Brother Tyree's work. Best of luck, always."
2,For the Love of Money...Dont Wastse Your Money!,"I consider myself a big fan of Omar Tyree, and when i purchased this book i thought that this would better than the Flyy. It was a big yawnnn! tyree does not have any edge in this book, and does not do justice for the original Flynn Girl. No excitement, no real disappointments for his character Tracy, and no Man!! Omar...go back to the old days and find those true writing skills that you possesed in the past!!"
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If there were a ""0"" that's what I would give this book! Flyy Girl was very good so of course I expected the follow-up to be just as good as if not better than the original.I was so disappointed! I kept reading only because I thought that it would just have to get better - unfortunately it didn't!It was very, very, boring!I wouldn't wish this read on my worst enemy!"
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"""For the love of money is okay, but I must agree with the readers that the pitch to make Fly Girl a movie and reference to himself was rather arrogant. Allow the readers to put the pressure on hollywood if that what they want. My biggest comment is the poetry that was reflected in the book. As a poet, I am the first to realize that poetry is truly subjective. But the poetry in the book was BAD!!!!. I love the idea of blending poetry with the storyline, however, there needs to be a balance. The poetry itself would not stand up to the critical audiences of Chicago. Omar, it is a blessing to be able to sell books on your name, now give us what you are capable of. Your books have diminished in quality."
1,What Happened?,"Now I'd like to consider myself an Omar Tyree fan, but For the Love of Money and his latest offering, Just Say No!, were way below par. I hope his subsequent books are a better representation of his earlier works."
1,And the Moral of the story is?,"I must say that ""For The Love Of Money"" was my first Omar Tyree novel, but I wasn't really impressed. I gave this writer the benefit of the doubt and decided to read another one of his books, ""Sweet St. Louis"", but I just couldn't get into the story. I found ""FTLOM"" to be a more of a book for teenage-ish readers. For one, I found main character, Tracie, to be a bit too unrealistic. I thought it was a good thing of her to go back to her hometown and show others that they could make it out too, but the story line was a weak, and the plot even weaker. I hope that Omar's new book, ""Leslie"" does better, but I will have to go to the library to read that one."
3,For the Love of Omar,"I loved Flyy Girl. In fact to date, it is one of the best books I've ever read. It is also the reason I purchased For the Love of Money. Originally I was completely disappointed. It doesn't flow like Flyy Girl. It doesn't have the same intensity and story development as Flyy Girl. I truly expected more. On it's own I give it a 3. But a Flyy Girl Sequel it is not! Omar was not focused for this one..."
2,BORING,This one was not like Flyy Girl and what I do not consider this to be a sequel. Very disappointed
3,Book has good ideas,"But it isn't as creative as I would like it to be. A lot of the cakes seem to be ways to decorate a regularly shaped cake or cupcakes with special candies, etc. I was really looking for a book with more ideas of ways to cut round and rectangle cakes to make 3-dimensional/more original cakes.The instructions are good. Would also prefer if the pictures were more professional looking. I'm not a great decorator, but on some pages I think I could have done a better job than the decorator for the book."

3,Chillingly creepy...,"Meghan admires the Trevor family--the way they are so warm and welcoming, and the way the three kids (West, Tuesday, and Brown) all get along. Every chance she gets, Meghan hangs around. Even at nine years old, she has a crush on West and believes they will be together someday. When Meghan, West, Tuesday, and Brown play Freeze Tag with Lannie, a neighborhood girl who nobody likes, they discover that when Lannie touches you, you really freeze. Lannie refuses to unfreeze Meghan until West makes a terrible promise.Now that Meghan, West, and Lannie are in high school, Meghan and West are in love, and Lannie is out in the cold--until Lannie reminds West of his long-forgotten promise. Lannie wants West and is jealous of Meghan, who seems to have everything. If West won't keep his promise, Meghan just might end up frozen forever.Suspenseful page-turner that makes you think about what happens to children who nobody loves."
2,Ok,"It's pretty good, I've read better, but the book seemed to really upset me... I mean, here's this girl, Lannie, who just prances into Meghan Moores and West Trevors love life and takes the kid over... i felt they should have just killed her, or something! And the book seemed to go really slow and then had a sped up, confusing end. Meghan should have just let her freeze!"
1,"Worked once, then broke","Not worth the cheap price. It worked once and then promptly broke. By higher quality, don't waste time with this one."
2,"Good cup, bad lid, annoying silicone ring","If this were just a plain glass measuring cup, I would give it a higher rating. It's easy to read and I like being able to look down into it and get an accurate reading rather than have to bend down and look at it from the side. But like the previous reviewer said, the lid doesn't fit well. Also, the silicone ring on the bottom of the cup is hard to work with. It's meant to keep the cup from sliding around on the counter (was this a problem?). But then, if you push the cup lightly to move it out of your way, it won't budge, Instead, it tips over, spilling two cups of whatever you're measuring all over the counter."
2,Mediocre CD-RW Drive,"The Yamaha SCSI burner is very average. It messes up quite often, and you can only fix it if you use CD-RW discs. It causes bluriness in my CD-Rs and often mutes it temporarily."
5,American Chopper Vid,I had the first two episodes of the Car build bought from another store but this was the one I didnt have. Nothing can be badly said about it. It was the original showing on Discovery and was perfect.
2,A Disappointment,"Strangely, quite unlistenable. The tracks are foreign and not very musical. No excerpts from the hilarious dialogue of the movie. Just an oddity to your CD collection, if you're into that sort of thing. And this is coming from a die-hard Borat fan."
3,NOTE these are CMC Media!,"After buying Memorex media in the past and always receiving high-quality Ricoh's, I am dissapointed that these are the less superior manufactured CMC's. With Memorex delegating to numerous different manufacturers you never know what you'll get."
1,Money Can Be Spent Better Elsewhere,"This printer is not worth the hastle. It eats ink cartridges like there is no tomorrow, breaks often, and does not have 1/8th the print quality of the newer inkjet printers on the market. My advice: spend the extra money to get a newer, higher quality printer in the first place rather than spending your money on this cheaper one now and then having to buy the newer one anyway when this one breaks."
4,chick flick,gift for my wife cant find in any stores for this price. havent watched it yet but package looks okay
2,average at best,this film tries to tell to many stories all at once but doesn't do any of the Characters justice.Alfre Woodard does a good solid job.Maya Angelou deserved better than playing second string to Winona Ryder.whose role is rather bland here.
2,not so much,I wanted more from this and was disappointed. It was flat and lacking and very few tracks did anything for me.
5,The Best Book Ever W5ritten on Silenty Comedy,"I don't know what I can add to what has been said before. The section on Buster Keaton is worth the price of the book. Walter Kerr was the premier theater critic in America. His wife, Jean Kerr, wrote funny books,too (Please Don't Eat The Daisy's.)He brought a lifetime of theatrical knowledge and critical insight to the subject of Silent Comedy with a clarity of thought and brilliance of expression that is still unequalled. If I have any quibble, it is that the book is large and difficult to hold while nestled in a recliner chair. But it's well worth the effort."
5,All you need for trading,I have read this book 3 times and I can honestly say it is the best I have come upon so far.It is not for the beginner though. You need to have a clear understanding of technical charting to follow this read.What it did for me is eliminate the clutter as to what tools you need as well as diverging philosophies from unique traders. The stress placed on money management and the common sense of many of the traders Dr. Elder sites are priceless.Learn technical analysis then buy this book. You won't need anything else in my opinion.
4,Vegan Cooking,I purchased this book for my sister and she loves it so far. It's giving her more ideas of what she can make and it's been pretty easy to follow the recipes.
5,Restoring the Earth: Visionary Solutions from the Bioneers,"This book is fantastic I wish we could restore this earth, with man it is impossible, But with God the Creator of everything all is possible for sure thanks"
3,Very good for a while . . .,"I bought the iriver iFP 780 in 12/05. It worked wonderful for a couple months. But now the mode/rec button is stuck and so I am eternally stuck in radio mode with no way to switch back to any other mode. Before this issue, I was very happy and perhaps this is an issolated experience but beware of breakage."
4,Nostalgic Video,"A great way to ""stroll down memory lane"" while trying to get my kids to appreciate what I did when I was young. DVD was in good condition - still wrapped - and arrived quickly."
1,Better off with another set of clubs,"I learned how to juggle clubs with these clubs and I was not impressed by them. The top knobs fell off of two of them from casual practice over carpet in a matter of weeks. They are completely hollow and have no balance to them.I'd go for the clubs made by duncan, they're about the same price but of a better quality, mine have lasted years of abuse and held up fine, minus minor scratches from drops over concrete. They are also much better weighted and balanced."
3,Could be better - Could be worse.,...A nice capsule of Cher's career so far. Most would be better served to buy a record from the cher era they like most.
5,very satisfied,Received Remote on time was as discribed looks brand new no signs of any wear.Had a little prob. coding it. Merchant answered every e-mail sent to them. Want to thank them for thier immediate response to all my e-mails. Their concern for myproblem was more than I would ever have expected. They helped me every step along the way till it was coded & I was satisfied.
2,Not believable and not entertaining,"It seemed that they wanted to make the whole movie based on the ""summation"" speech at the end. It might be nice for some people to think that all you have to do is make a nice speech and you win a case and you get handed a check for millions, but if that is what the movie is going to be, just cut all the other stuff and show the speech and the jury awarding a huge sum of money. The movie was boring and downright unbelievable. It is totally ridiculous that he would have won the verdict based on what happened in the movie. It was a waste of time to watch. Here's the synopsis: drunk lawyer gets a slam-dunk case, nothing goes right in the case for him and everyone can tell he should lose, he makes a heartfelt closing argument, and finally, the jury awards him and his client millions."
5,Tremendous Actor,"This was a great role for Paul Newman. He was simply brilliant in his portrayal of the down-trodden Frank Galvin, esq. Good storyline as well."
5,A Lawyer's Lawyer Flick,"If you love Boston Irish and a riveting tale of the dark sides of the Catholic church and a burned-out trial lawyer's ordeal of redemption, you'll love this movie. Certainly, there are flaws. For example, a scene quite overstated features the Concannon law firm's platoon of junior trial-preparation flunkies holding a council of war in the stained-glass Gothic splendor of a conference room fit for European royalty. At the end of the trial, Concannon cites a case precedent in a manner that makes no sense (and it would have been just as easy to give a correct-sounding citation). These flaws do nothing to detract from the film's dramatic virtues, however, leaving the viewer completely satisfied that justice has prevailed in the face of massive institutional corruption. Here the cheaters lose big and arrogance gets it in the neck. Wonderful."
4,Nice laptop case,"Pretty decent laptop case. It provides nominal protection, as it's designed to do (it's not deeply padded) and has a handy storage pocket. One thing I think is missing is a shoulder strap. Pretty stylish and durable for the price."
1,A Review Destined To Be Deleted Like Others Have Had Done By J.T. Albert,"Fake writer. Fake sentiment. True BS.As someone who has REALLY experienced some of the horrors Laura ""J.T."" Albert claims to understand, I find her calculated attempts to pass this stuff off as meaningful fact to be beyond insulting. I can't think of a better example of all which personifies the greed and selfishness of ""crash and burn America"" than this self-important fraud."
1,how to exploit the pain of others to make a success of yourself,"If anything speaks volumes about the greed and self-absorbed heart of ""crash and burn America"" it would be this scam posing as literature. More than anything though, I feel bad for those REAL children who have been abused and who, thanks to Laura ""J.T."" Albert's fraud, will find it very difficult now to find publishers that'll take them seriously."
1,Worse than Zero,"This book has zero credibility, coming from a middle-aged woman masquerading as an abused and prostituted street kid. It also has zero quality in terms of writing: sentimental, sloppy, and stupid, stupid, stupid. I think Laura Albert may have turned to her buddy Carrie Fisher for help on this one."
2,Ira Silverberg in yesterday's New York Times,"When learning he was among the scammed, ""Leroy""'s agent said it best yesterday: ""To present yourself as a person who is dying of AIDS in a culture which has lost so many writers and voices of great meaning, to take advantage of that sympathy and empathy, is the most unfortunate part of all of this,"" Mr. Silverberg said. ""A lot of people believed they were supporting not only a good and innovative and adventurous voice, but that we were supporting a person.""There ya go."
5,an amazing product,"We do a lot of travelling and it sure is nice to be able to charge my startac whenever and whereever I want. The charger does not need electricity. All I need is a baggie to keep it in when not in use. I keep one charger in my glove compartment, one in my desk at work, and one on my workstation at home. For the price and serviceability of this charger, I cannot recommend it enough."
5,A guide which serves as a systematic treatise,"This is a biogeographic region based guide, rather than one adhering strictly to political boundaries. Like the best bird guides (e.g. Stiles on Costa Rica, ffrench on Trinidad and Tobago), this guide approaches a systematic review of the avifauna concerned in its comprehensiveness. The excellent coverage of the island birds is especially notable. The only drawback is that some species, mostly waterbirds, that are well-illustrated in standard US-Canada guides, are not illustrated here."
3,Needs Pictures w/ Information,"Used the book in Honduras (Ruinas Copan) and lowland Guatemala (Peten). Great work in many ways. Just needs to be more user and field friendly. In many ways it is far superior to Sibley's for NA, but lost many identifications due to not having picture adjacent to the text. Oh, more ""in flight"" information needed."
4,A great gift for a cat lover,"This book tells the story of a cat, who lives in a bookstore, and is able to help a young boy. The story is cute and charming. It makes a great gift for a child who loves cats."
2,Ask yourself one question . . .,"Musically, I would say that the thing that many reviewers like most about this album is also what some might like least about it. If you want to know if you are going to enjoy this CD, ask yourself one question:How much do I like the banjo?If you love the twangy banjo sound and don't mind predictable / repetitive chords, than you are really going to like this album. If not, and you are used to listening to imaginative, layered electronic music, check out Illinoise by Stevens - which has a lot more instrumental range and complexity, and 22 songs - so you are more likely to find something you like. That said, there are a few gems on this album as well, such as Abraham & To be Alone with you."
2,Not impressed...,"This book is flawed. In an attempt to write a gender-based history, the author actually offers a limited, gender-biased view of the past three centuries. Much of the book is a history of the feminist movement. Men and conservatives are villanized, while feminists are glorified. This wouldn't be so apprehensible if the book at least revealed historical trends in the woman's movement. Instead, the reader is forced to infer and piece these trends together from 560 pages. Furthermore, the author overly-references historically isolated and irregular figures and portrays them as representative of all women during the period. Needless to say, I was unimpressed with her product."
4,"Remember that band, Helmet?","""Guide"" definately is a damn fine album. If you dig Helmet, Unsane, or Quicksand, this is in the same vein, although distinguishable.If you like music hard, loud, noisy, fast, and dig that drop-d guitar, then this is an easy pick up. Get it now, dammit!"
3,Looks like a sequal to Pearl Harbor...,"I bought the game and played it for a couple hours and got bored... Sure, you get to [aim] at Jap planes, but I get fed up trying to aim when the [weapons] constantly sway back and fourth. You have poor control over the [weapons], I don't like that... Still, it's sort of fun to play... for awhile... You takes your chances... I'm not for or against this one... You get to [aim] from several different mounts aboard ship, you can [aim at] and sink other ships - Jap ships, which I enjoyed... But, you have to keep jumping from one mount to another looking for targets and then your firing range is severely restricted. ..."
2,NOT the Full Album!!!,"I expected it to be the full Album...but it is missing some of the songs that go along with the narration, LIKE X-RAY TED!!!! Dang! Not a happy space trucker! : ("
2,"Slow Warm up, Limited pages.","THe printing from the printer is very good. It takes a good 5 minutes to warm up if it has not been used for a day or so. Also, when printing reports, when it gets to page ten, it starts spitting garbage. This is not my complaint only. Others have similar problem."
1,Bob,It worked OK but didn't last long. Worked well and printed quickly and fairly quietly. Has long since been replaced. Not quality workmanship.
5,amazing and mermezing album,"Deep space and calm atmospheres, the best new age album of this century... Thanks Mister Subramaniam."
5,Most Powerful Form Of Meditation Available.,This book details the true nature of space and time. It also details some of the most power forms of qigong/neigong available. This book is a must have for any person studying qigong/neigong.
1,Not long lived,"Contrary to the product review, this battery pack does not have a long life. The only reason I'm buying a new one is because it's what my camera uses. If I had known then what I know now about this battery pack, I wouldn't have bought the camera."
1,I wish I had something better to say...,"I have loved VC Andrews for years. The first few books after her death we still great - they found the perfect ghostwriter. Now, something has certainly changed because the book was awful. I kept waiting for it to get ""to the point"" and it never did. It might be the end of the line!"
4,Make a nice inexpensive gift,"I gave a couple of these as a gift and she really liked them, especially the lotion. The socks were nice too."
2,Not worth the money,"I don't think that the Pimsleur Hindi course teaches you very much when compared with the money invested. To their credit, they will help you learn a few phrases very well. But they don't go into much detail, and the vocabulary that you learn is very limited. Also, you learn practically nothing about grammar. I think the Pimsleur language courses are cut from the same mold, so they don't go into specific things that would be helpful for a particular language. Teach Yourself Hindi by R. Snell costs half as much and is ten times more useful, especially if you get the audio edition that comes with cassette tapes."
4,Pimsleur Hindi,"Excellent Introduction. Very limited vocabulary choices, but some useful words and excellent pronunciation. Lots of repetition. Was useful for me in India."
5,"Hindi, Comprehensive (Pimsleur) Lessons 1-30","I love the Pimsleur series and I hope they will publish the next 30 lessons. I listen to the 30 minute tapes during my work commute....not only do I enjoy the drive, I am learning a language that is completely new to me. The pacing seems perfect; if I do not feel comfortable with my ability after any lesson, I simply repeat it. I am so enthusiastic and really proud of myself for getting through the 30 lessons that I have now purchased a Hindi textbook and workbook to continue. I am now listening again from the beginning and picking up even more the second time around."
3,Thumbs Down from a Native Speaker,"I've tried Pimsleur Spanish and like it a lot (much better than Learning Spanish Like Crazy) so I'm not hating on Pimsleur when I say that the disc overall and the pronunciation are extremely weak.A. First off, somebody needs to tell you how to make the sounds. Western speakers cannot imitate Arabic or Indian language sounds simply by hearing them. They must be taught.B. Second, on certain words emphasis has been placed on incorrect portions of the word (done intentionally to make it easier to recognize all of the syllables). It's not a bad idea when first introducing the word, but the word should be pronounced correctly at some point!!C. The ""native"" speakers sound ridiculous. Their pronunciation, accents, and dialogue are laughable. Is this what you want to be imitating? Of course not.Plus the Hindi discs seem much more boring than the Spanish ones.Check out the Pimsleur website for free previews of all their CDs (that's what I've based this review off of)."
5,Delicious!,I bought a couple of tea bags in a hospital gift shop along with the Mandarin Chai with Anise to try and I absolutely loved these teas. I have to admit though this vanilla cream spice tea is my favorite. I enjoy anything vanilla and this tea delivers. I agree with another reviewer who said it seems like the cream is already in the tea. The spice flavor isn't overwhelming and it smells wonderful. All pluses. So glad I found it on Amazon.
4,Good stuff,This tea smells and tastes terrific. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it costs more to ship the tea than for the box of tea itself!
2,Would Not Recommend,"The movie was weak. Weak in character development and plot. The climatic battle needed more and the ending was to perfect. The movie could have been good, but wasn't. With all the other family fantasy books and movies out there, I would say don't go with this one."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would.,"Wow, where to begin... I have read the book but Im not one to pick a movie apart based on the book. If I did, I'd have to tear Lord of the Rings to pieces (which I loved as a movie). Anyway, Seeker is hands down the worst movie I've seen in a long while. It takes a 9 on my Eyes Wide Shut Scale of Bad Movies. Why? Terrible acting... super-over-the-top melodramatic scenes... an annoyingly inconsistent and incomprehensible plotline... idiotic amount if tension building with absolutely no pay off. In short its a lot like an episode of Dragonball Z, in a kids' fantasy movie clothing."
2,Not Worth It,"I know a lot of people complain about movies not being as good as the books but this one really falls short of the mark. Much of the book's charm, it's sense of adventure, or just it's plot were lost in this adaptation. It was very disappointing."
1,rubbish,"Absolute drivelwas the family american in the book nodid the father suffer from a nervous break down and sat feeling sorry for himself noI loved the books and hopefully when I read them again, i can get this awful movie out of my mind"
1,Disappointing...,"I have waited nearly all my life for someone to make Susan Cooper's ""The Dark is Rising"" books into a film(s). Now that there is one, I wish it was never made. Why can't producers and screenwriters just STICK TO THE BOOK??? The books are SO much more interesting than this movie. Even just by watching the trailer, you can tell that they practically changed at least 50% of the story. And the Rider's horse is supposed to be BLACK!"
2,"A disappointment, even for those who didn't read the book.","Even without reading the book I knew things weren't right with this movie. I felt like there were holes and important events left out, and the entire movie just felt rushed. The special effects were good, and the story itself seems like it would be good enough to invest in the book. But the movie was poorly done, and I am sure that we can blame a majority of that on a poorly written script. I imagine, had I read the book before hand, I would have been left with the same unsatisfied feeling I had after watching Eragon. I was rather disappointed. But on a good note, this movie has sparked my interest enough to buy the books in the near future."
2,Minimal protection,"This lock came on a used bike I purchased.The lock was like new condition but I did not have the combo.A quick web search gave me instructions on how to ""pick"" the lock in less than 5 minutes.After you know how it takes less than a minute. I would be scared to leave this lock locked to a pole by itself let alone protecting by bike. Might be good for lawn chairs."
2,Don't waist your time reading this one!,"Well, I hate to be negative but I found Judith O'Brien's Maiden Voyage to be uninspiring. There was no romance; just a quickie between two people that you didn't even think felt anything for each other through the whole book. A ghost that's in love with a sickly, childlike, couch-ridden maiden. The people of Ireland were depicted as strange and the location depressing. The only good part of the book was the pub scenes. Which took up about a page."
1,NOT an extensio (M-F) cable,"An extension cable is, in normal technical usage, a Male-Female cable that can be used to extend (hence ""extension"") the length of another cable. This item is NOT an extension cable."
4,Doctor Who: Arc of Infinity,"Omega, one of the greatest Time Lords, was believed to have been destroyed by the matter/anti-matter explosion in The Three Doctors. But suddenly someone has stolen the Doctor's bio=print from Gallifrey and the Doctor is forced to return to his home planet to save himself and the Time Lords. A good adventure that shows us a rare early glimpse at Gallifrey."
5,now reading,I am now reading this book and enjoying it a lot. Learning lots about Omaha area. Till recently I lived in Bellevue mentioned in the book. Now living across Missouri river in Iowa and go to Council Bluffs frequently. It is in the book also
1,Musician's Gear Deluxe Electric Guitar Case (Black),"The workmanship is so shoddy I do not understand these high reviews. On the case I got the screw that holds the wood hinge for the accessory compartment flap was screwed in about an inch away from where it should be to fasten the wood. So one side of the flap was not attached at all (I guess it was flapping around). There were loose staples embedded in the interior fabric (which would have done a number on the guitar) and the end of a staple and the sharp end of a screw sticking out in the accessory compartment.Very disappointing, especially with nearly a 5 star rating."
5,Great!,"This book was so great! Gia is one of my favorite characters even tho she's pysco. YOu have to read this book. I can totally see how Leslie became Gia and changed everything about herself all for a guy. I would never do that but I know girls at my school who would do something like that. This is a great book for showing you that even if you really like a guy, you shouldn't change everything about yourself to make him like you because if he didn't like you before he probably wont like you changed. Everyone should read this book."
3,Poor sound quality,"A lot of songs for little money, however, there are no liner notes and the sound quality is very poor. To some it may sound ""authentic,"" but there are many other compilations that are a much better introduction to B.B. King."
3,"Original cover, as expected, but contents weren't","The cover was worn, as described in the description, but there were ink markings on the back that I didn't expect. The vinyl record was NOT ""Meet The Beatles"", but was ""Rubber Soul"". I was very disappointed but, as it was a gift that I had framed, I kept it anyway. HOWEVER, I do want to mention that the seller was sincerely apologetic, and refunded all of my cost. I would order from them again."
5,My Favorite Hawkwind Album,"I guess it's mainly because I love the studio versions of ""Down Through the Night"" and ""Space is Deep"" so much, but the rest of the album is pretty fine, too.However, I did notice that it doesn't sound quite as good as it did 30+ years ago, when I used to crank this thing after a bit of ""chemical enhancement""."
3,A decent book on marketing and promotion.,"I found this book to be best for covering the basics of marketing and promotion on the internet. However, as is the problem with many internet books, the links and e-mail addresses offered in the book are out of date and don't work. Despite this problem, the book is very helpful and full of good information."
2,Not worth buying,"Although this is a detailed description of what Clinical Kinesiology is, I do not feel confident that I can do these body tests (which seem to amount to holding one of your arms up perpendicular to your reclining body) and determining which body part, including internal organs, needs medical and/or health intervention. Really? I am just glad that I didn't pay any more than the $8.00 (including the $3.99 shipping) for this book. Save your money."
5,HIGHLY Recommended,Marion E Carl is a true hero and this book is a well written documentation of the man. Even if you are not interested in Fighter Pilots this is an excellent book to read!
4,Defects on Season 6,"Minor defects. Disc 1 in Highlander season 6 won't play in 1 DVD player, but will play in another. Also, Disc 2's 1st episode repeats for 3 episodes. This is the manufacturer's fault."
2,Not for young viewers at all,"My school uses this as part of the curriculum for the first graders. I am referencing 6 year olds in my review here. I am at a loss as to why my children, at the age of 6, need to learn about bigotry and hate and riots and firebombing. To a child, they all come out of viewing the video noticing one another's skin color. For the first time, by and large. My children are mixed race, and they have come home terrified that their father will be assassinated and wondering why their white mommy hates their black daddy. All they remember is that MLK Jr get's his head blown off by a white man.Teach my children how to spell, play dodgeball and basic math skills. Leave it to me to determine when they are old enough to learn that there are people who will judge them based upon the most superficial things, and that prior to 40 years ago, it was legal to do so. They have a lifetime to learn about hatred and such a short time to enjoy being a child. Head shaking."
1,Bad book,"I cant belive this has good ratings, We must have noot been reading the same book!Couldnt get past 10 pages. Yes thats all it took. Main character sounded to much like a country hick.I dont like to get refunds expecially if i have read any of it, but this book was to much."
5,Pleasantly Complex,"""Effie Briest"" is an 1895 German novel that is a fine example of artful thinking and worth reading if one can appreciate leisurely detail. Like all good stories, it not only presents an interesting set of events, but comments on life and thrills the reader a little with the mystery of things. The main character is a pleasure-loving and secretive girl who is briefly unfaithful to her gentle but neglectful husband with sad consequences for everyone around her. The entire course of her marriage is described, from her acceptance of the marriage proposal to the misery of her separation from her child and death, but sensational moments (such as her liaison with her lover) are skipped over and attention is given instead to psychological matters that explain the events. The author had read Shakespeare and, like him, presents a theme that keeps appearing in a variety of forms, which makes the thought pleasantly complex."
5,The Ten Commandments,"My husband and I accidentally had the right channel on at the right time. The film began on our tv, when we were ready to go to sleep and retire for the evening. We couldn't.We were riveted from the moment it grabbed us. We are born again christians, and usually pretty discerning about the interpretations we watch.Well, for a rendition of Moses that stars hipsters like Padma Lakshmi, that I usually would prejudge, this gets a double thumbs up.Top notch in factual, relevant content, effects, and delivery. Wish I could buy it for everyone I know."
1,THIS MOVIE STINKS. INACCURATE.,"THIS MOVIE IS A GARBAGE. MOSES IS A LUNATIC IN THE MOVIE. HE SENDS HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN INTO THE BARREN DESERT ALONE AND RUNS OFF WITH THE FREE ISRAELITES. HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS FAMILY WITH THEM. HE ALSO ORDERS THE FREED ISRAELITES TO MURDER A LARGE GROUP OF CHILDREN OF FREED ISRAELITES BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DID EVIL. THIS IS AN EVIL, TWISTED, PERVERTED MOVIE. IT IS AN ATTACK ON MOSES AND THE FREED ISRAELITES. MOSES NEVER ORDERED THE MURDER OF CHILDREN. IT ACTUALLY SHOWS CHLIDREN BEING STABBED."
1,WARNING - Not the C.B. DeMille Epic Version,Was not paying close attention and though I was getting the great C. B. Demille version. Very disappointing. A waste of blu-ray technology.
4,excellent pyschedelic music from the 1970's,I purchased this CD basically because I had the album back in 1971. The CD sound's great and it brought back many memories of my youth. Not on the same par as Pink Floyd but from the same scene. I really like the saxophone work on this CD. Of all the Hawkwind music I have heard over the years this is still my favorite.In Search of Space
4,Pre-historic Hawkwind,"great charm .. limited musical quality compared to later releases.. the developing Hawkwind sat very much in the late 60's musicallyProduction isn't great at times . Some tracks are good eg We took... some (only Dreaming, children on the sun, adjust me) do little for me. Master of the Universe became a great song live, the original studio version sounds to me tame and poorly produced.As an evolving band this album has an innocent charm hence the rating"
4,"THE LAST MERCENARY, BY DIANA PALMER",I like her writing. She pulls the reader into the story even though you know it will have a happy ending. Her writing is open and honest.
1,"Designed for self improvement, Not For Teaching","The book and series of books are very good for improving your own skills but its layout does not lend itself for teaching. The answers are imbeded in the book and can not be removed or even covered up to test a student. The book could easily be redisgned to move all the answers to the back of the book and even could be designed for easy removal. Also, the online test are not chaptere based but more of an overall review after you have finished the entire book. I bought this book to add to my childs homework studies but was very disappointed because of its construction limitations. In fact, I bought five different books from math to reading and they all had the same construction pitfall."
3,Success IF you're in the most BASIC Algebra class,"I really like this book to use as a diagnostic tool for basic Algebra 1 skills and basic Algebra 1 remediation. However, this is not a comprehensive book when it comes to a high school Algebra 1 class or a college level Algebra class. If you struggle with the very, VERY basics of Algebra, then this hit the key concepts and has a good amount of practice problems.I've noticed that people have commented on the answers not being correct, however, I'm a math tutor, so I don't really look at them. I will say that the post-test had one question with no correct answers. Other than that, I can't comment."
3,Not for Low Readers,This book was intended to be used for middle school students who are identified as having reading disabilities. The passages are to high level for their comprehension but I like the set up of the material.
5,"Great case, very nice design",This is a great case that seems to be designed just right. Fits my camera great and is made of nice leather material. I'd recommend it to everyone.
2,not made well,"The vitamin lids don't stay closed... Put it in my purse and the they went everywhere! It was a mess, very bummed."
2,one of the most overrated bands from the sixties,"I recived this cd as a gift. I was never a big fan of this group and after giving this cd a listen, i know why, because I feel that their music really wasn't that good. For the most part they were part of the drug culture of the sixties, but their music fails to express the true essence of the era. The doors, traffic, the turtles, the animals and/or the zombies were much better bands whose music captures the culture of the time. Dylan and Melanie were also part of the folk scene but were much more creative than this band. I don't understand why so many people liked this group, i think they were avarage at best. In my opinion, this is not a CD worth owning and they do not deserve to be part of the 20th century masters collection."
2,Home automation for my home,A good reference for starting but has few details of the current technologies. The explanation is good.For starting it os not sufficient.
5,Read All of The Reviews,"This tool did everything I needed it to do, but I sure am glad I read all of the reviews here. Thanks to the suggestions and advice from other owners, my first experience with wall texturing went very well.-read all the reviews-practice-expect success"
2,wagner textruizer,Can only use a certain consistency as if it is too thick it will just run down your arm and it's very messy
1,Nasty human hair in the box,"I got this product today, and I found long white human hair, and little stones in the package; I have the impression that this product has no quality control at all. I wouldn't buy it from Baar again."
2,Season 5 and 6 heavy?,"I cannot help but say I'm suprised by this. The earlier seasons (1/2/3) are almost universally accepted as the best by the fans - and we only get a single season 2 episode in this collection?? This is not even close to what I'd assemble as an ""essential"" list. Season 4 I can understand, as that was not well accepted overall. I guess I just find it hard to believe that this is truly representative of fan desires (and I've been a huge Xena fan since the show's start.) Perhaps the fans shouldn't have been involved at all! A list of shows showing Xena's evolution, starting with her appearance on Hercules, and ending with her death - and all comedy and non-arc stories generally excluded - would have gone a lot farther."
5,"Best overall tv series, ever","While I can't say the greatest things about getting these vids through Amazon, mine at least did work. The show is spectaculor. It's campy, it's fun, it's serious, it has moral lessons, it has civil lessons, and just basically a good show about dealing with personal conflict and with that of those around you. That nobody is perfect, and even with a dark past and mistakes, a person can be redeemed. Sometimes, it just takes another person caring or showing you the light in the world. Xena WP is the closest to a perfect show that I can think of. Oh, it had some faults, but overall, it's hands-down the best series ever."
3,"I love the series, but the DVD package was bad.","I got the Xena series DVD package and was not happy with it. Just like the Hercules package, most of the DVDs were scratched. While watching the episodes, it would stop and freeze, and then jump, then jump again, then jump to a scene about 20 minutes later. I did finally manage to get it all fixed thanks to Hastings with their DVD-CD scratch reapair and buffer machine. Overall i wasnt happy with this entire transaction."
4,Go Xena!,Many of the best Xena episodes on these dvds. Great value for the price. Not all my favorite episodes were included but plenty of great to re-watch episodes are in this collection!
5,Gift for oldest grandson,These sweatpants were very reasonably priced and the fit was very good. They were comfortable to wear and made a warm outfit with the sweatshirt.
2,Does it really cut it,This book is an OK introductory organic chemistry text however I wanted more. I personally needed a book which gives a clear understanding of the basics and advanced concepts. I found two books which if used together produce the best results.March's advanced organic chemistry and Organic chemistry by wade (6th edition).These books are of tremendous help to me in understanding the fundamentals and also the more advanced concepts of organic chemistry. I also wanted to save money as I am doing further organic synthesis and other carbon chemistry subjects later on so I needed a book that is particularly good for reference.If you are prescribed this book then go for it but I personally feel it doesnt really cut it for me. (I will edit this soon)
4,Good nailer,"This is the first air nailer I have bought. I used it to put bead-board on a ceiling and trim my house.The only jam I have had required me to disassemble the entire feeding mechanisim. I don't think that is normal protocol for this tool.It took some adjustment on the air pressure to really get these guns working well.I don't particularly like the soft case for storage. However, when I have to take them to the worksite it is nice to have the extra room for different sized nails, oil, wrenches..."
5,Great Tool,"If you need a high quality punchdown tool for your cat-5 female connector needs.You may see this is a lot to pay for a tool, but quality will last you a lifetime."
1,PURE GARBAGE!!,"This movie is absolutely PURE GARBAGE. Horrible in every respect. Do not waste your money on this and certainly do not waste your time on this joke of a movie. The idea that the thermal footprint of a city can reach the mesosphere is hilarious. Not only is the plot completely stupid, but the acting is some of the worst I've seen.And, who was the spastic camera man? Terrible, terrible, terrible!!! I am giving a one star rating only because I cannot give it a zero or for that matter a negative 5."
1,Too bad the rating doesn't include negative stars,"The whole movie is made from stage scenes, a few plastic models and all action destruction scenes were poorly made digital scenes. The movie content is the worst I have seen in any disaster film and picture quality is clearly not blu ray.The film (Aftershock, earthquake in new york) is a great example of realistic looking film production, that on a star scale would rate 10 if the Catagory 7 was rated a Negative 10. Don't waste your time or rental money on this loser."
4,Surprisingly Fun Movie,"I bought this item because it was a cheap blu-ray and looked interesting. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the acting wasn't top notch, this was actually a fun and entertaining movie. The PQ was good and I think it is a good value."
2,Way not worth the money,"I bought this book for my son thinking that it would be full of color photos, copious amounts of information, and entertaining reading. It turns out that the book is very small, has too little information, and no color plates at all. It is way over priced.This is the problem I have found with trying to buy a book sight unseen off Amazon.com and other similar sites. One expects to get good value for money but ends up getting ripped off."
3,Humorous and Disturbing,"It is interesting to see all the intrigues of leadership in ancient Rome. Being emperor, while thought to be a cushy arrangement, was actually one of the most dangerous jobs at the time. Needless to say, most people didn't hang on to the position for long. Intra-family murders and marriages, poisonings, insanity, cowardice, conceit, and sheer incompetence led to the early demise of most Roman rulers. The illustrations that accompany each account are absolutely hilarious! Recommended reading for anyone who has an interest in ancient Roman history."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had this book in my ""To Be Read"" pile for quite some time before taking it with me on a mini beach vacation. I really liked both the concept and the setting of the story but unfortunately, the TERRIBLE dialogue and non-existent plot kept me from enjoying this book. The characters all talked in stock ""pithy"" dialogue which is not how normal people speak to one another - it wasn't even clever pithy dialogue. Secondly, it took more than half of the book get any sort of plot going - mostly the characters rode around in the duck boat and met up with other deliberately whimsical characters who served no story purpose whatsoever. I would also agree with many of the other reviewers who wrote that Jay Gilbertson has no concept of how to write women.Save your time and get another of the countless other ""fun beach read"" books out there."
1,all on same slow boat from China,"Same situation..but it's a supplier issue not Amazon's. I ordered on Jan 18 from another website, PowerSellerNYC, because they actually showed availability but after 3 weeks of waiting and 3 calls, they finally admitted that they were expecting some in from China but the order never arrived. My local Best Buy has been sold out since Christmas. The only reason I didn't cancel my order is because based on previous owners feedback, this system is the best value out there. I'm traveling to China in two weeks...and probably pass the boat that it is on.When it is in my hands and I see what it can do, maybe I will join the ranks and give it a 5 star rating."
1,Better off on a different system.,"The Need For Speed series is not good for the DS. I'll start by saying graphics are HORRIBLE! The races are very slow, even though the screen says you are going 140 mph. There are only about 4 upgrades for your car, and 5 for extirior looks! Your car handles HORRIBLE, making it impossible to win any races! Also, this game is not compatible with the touch screen! 1 star."
3,good game,son said they start you off with bad cars then you can open up better cars the more you play.
2,Overly complicated,While I work in the frield - this book is a tough read. Itr's style and presentation are very complex.
5,Snorri is great but must be taken with a grain of salt.,"If you have an interest in mythology, Scandinavian culture, pre-Christian Indo-European worldview then this is a must read book. If your an Odinist this is a must read book, HOWEVER, the Eddas are not an Odinist bible. Snorri was a Christian who wrote this stuff 200 years after Iceland converted to Christianity. There are obvious Christian influences in the Eddas and there are compelling arguments that some of the Gods in the Eddas were never worshipped by Heathens and put there for entertainment value by Snorri. That being said Snorri is still argueably the best source for Indo-European religion. You just have to take a lot of it with a grain of salt. The translation itself is entertaining and easy to read. Overall you can't go wrong here."
4,Good for people who want to help a missionary,"It was hard to read through this book.. However, if you are not going to a foreign country and just want to know how to help out a missionary, then read, it will help."
1,Outdated Material,"Read this book from cover to cover as an experienced archer and thought most of the information was superfluous. Authors tried to cover all aspects in a very brief amount of time and text. Methods are too standard stated in a matter-of-fact manner disregarding other theories, practices and methods. This book might be good for a boy scouts counselor but not a serious archer with goals of competition and proficiency. All illustrations are hand drawn leaving out critical detail."
5,Just as advertised,Just would like you to know that this item worked as advertised. Installation was a breeze. I would say it is almost impossible to make a mistake.
4,PUNK LOVE SONGS,"The music is fast and energetic with great guitar work, and there are some real gems here. Unlike the punk of its time, Buzzcocks embraced the love song with gusto, as on the classic Ever Fallen In Love. Just Lust is quite a tour de force, and Sixteen Again is a catchy little number with intelligent lyrics. I love Walking Distance's chiming guitars, while Love Is Lies with its prominent acoustic guitar is an engaging bittersweet love song. Late For The Train with its strong guitar onslaught sees tham going heavy on a rousing instrumental conclusion. This a brilliant album of melodic powerpop that impresses also with its literate and poetic lyrics."
3,Tester needs both ends in view.,"This kit is good, but the tester is not great for remote cable jack work, you have to have both sides of the cable in view to see the results. I thought I would be able to hook it up to a patch panel and test the horizontal wiring, but it doesn't work that way. Paladin customer service was clear about that also, so if the cable has both ends in sight this is the tool, if not a TDR unit is the way to go."
5,wonderful read and gorgeous to look at,"The title immediately caught the attention of my two grade-school boys; it refers to a statue called Evangelina but ""she's not naked,"" explains her sculptor. ""She's nude.""A recently widowed artist moves next door to a farm boy and in the end becomes his first art teacher. This is a rich book, deftly covering mourning, creativity, and neighborliness in one small plot. The sculptures are beautiful (and at times adorable), the characters nicely realized and the story held my boys' attention and discussions for several days afterwards. Fabulous last page, too!Highly recommended."
4,FOREST WARRIOR,"Watched this with my grandsons, ages 8-12. A little slow to start but once the actual story got moving, we enjoyed it very much. Very funny in parts and the action, of course was a hit with these youngsters!"
2,longevity is very bad,"At first these are fantastic. Strong, good charge. But after about 20-maybe 30 if that recharges, some of my batteries just dead. Or do not hold charge for more than a night. It is reall bad. I bought about 5 or 6 (4 packs) of these, more than half of it are useless."
2,Disappointed,"They worked great for awhile...but my best guess would be that I got no more than 120...and maybe as few as 70...charges/recharges out of the last two sets of these before giving up on them. Granted, this made them a cost-effective purchase versus regular alkaline batteries. However, based on the claim on the package (not sure they are still making this claim on newest packages) that you can expect as many as 1000 charging cycles out of these, I was disappointed."
3,Interesting discovery,"I have purchased 3 packs of these energizers at different times in the past few years. I recently noticed that one of the packs last MUCH longer than the other two. The difference is that one pack in made in Japan and has a gray/green top surrounding the the + terminal. The other is made in China and has a black top surrounding the + terminal.The surprise is that the China made black top batteries are the ones that last much longer. I use these in an electric toothbrush, and they will last 2 or more months on a single charge. The Japan made ones only last a couple weeks. I can't say if this will apply for everyone, but all 4 of the China Energizers greatly outlast the other 8 Japan Energizers I own."
1,The batteries do not hold a charge,I bought this product so I would not have to constantly buy new batteries for my mouse and keyboard. I didn't notice that that batteries were unable to hold a charge because my mouse tracks via LED and requires very little power.I am unable to return this product for a full refund because my 30 days has expired.
2,Die after 2 recharges,"Even after using a trickle charger, these keep dying left and right and will not charge any further. Will be looking for different brand of rechargeables."
3,"Just okay, but low powered at 1200 mah","mili amperes hour, I don't know If i got that right. thing is there are other batteries with 2500+ mah for the price"
1,Won't Hold a Charge When Not In Use,"Sadly, as great as these batteries are, they simply will NOT hold a charge when not in use. So, charge them up, put them in a drawer, and within about 2-4 weeks they're basically useless - as in they won't POWER anything and are completely dead.I really recommend Eneloops for AAs. Rayovac/Eneloop are fantastic for AAAs - as they have the 'low self-discharge' feature mastered and can actually hold/retain a charge for a while."
2,"Total Crap, waste of money","i feel so bad for spending my precious dollars on these AA batteries. The first time you charge them, they work great but after that they die and self discharge. AVOID THESE BATTERIES AT ALL COSTS."
1,Short lifetime for rechargeables,"I have had very bad luck with Energizer rechargeables; especially when using an Energizer charger according to manufacturer's instructions. I have had to recycle every Energizer rechargeable I've bought, usually within a few months. I haven't bought any for a few years, maybe they've overcome this problem; I'm not going to spend any more of my money to find out. My recommendation: go with Duracell or Rayovac the hybrids come pre-charged, nice go-along with gifts. You can find lots of reviews for rechargeables, this one compares Duracell & Energizer: [...]"
4,great batteries,Nice pack of batteries with a decent capacity. they sure help keeping my lights working without recharging so often. Thanks
3,Okay Product - There Are Better Batteries Out There...,"These AA rechargeable batteries work well and will save you money over the long term - however, if you click on the picture of the product, you'll notice that these batteries are rated at 1200 mAh. The Kodak rechargeable batteries (also available on this site) are rated at 1450 mAh and are THE SAME PRICE!!! If you aren't into the technical explanation of what the numbers mean, I'll help you; you get more juice for your buck with the Kodak product."
1,Very short charging cycle!,"I bought 3 packs of this Energizer rechargeable battery half a year ago and used 3 each time for my radio. I found the battery lifetime after each charge is gradually decreasing over time. Now is about 3-4 hours of listening time in my radio after each charge. If I use one-time non-rechargeable batteries, it lasts 30+ hours. This is a big surprise to me because I have to recharge these batteries every 3-4 days in the Energizer charger for at least 4 hours and it is very inconvenient. I would not recommend these batteries if you are looking for equivalent performance as normal non-rechargeable batteries."
2,Not ready for prime time!,Didn't know that I had to charge these batteries before using them. Good thing I purchased a battery charger at the same time!
1,Very short lifetime,The lifetime of those batteries are so short you would need dozens and overwhelming look after for continuous recharge. Not money worthy.
3,Ok...I guess,The product arrived quickly and before expected. The problem occurred when I opened the package and saw that the store retail sticker was still on the item and that the sticker had the item priced at less than half of what I paid for it. I guess I should have done more research...
2,The life period is too short.,"I had 8 bateries, until they could be charged they where good for my canon camera. but suddenly they die. I don't think i recharged them many times. Also I have another bateries (Orange/Blue) , I bought before than Energizer and they're still alive!"
3,go with eneloop,"I've used Energizer rechargeables almost exclusively until I realized there were better, if maybe not as well-known, brands on the market. I've used Energizer to power my keyboard, mouse, camera, and Zoom H2. They usually work fine for a few charges, but then they give out and don't hold a charge for longer than an hour in the H2. I recently switched to eneloop batteries and am much happier."
3,no title?,"i agree with the first reviewer, the first time you listen to it you remember all the bad songs....but it's not like the second time makes them good. it's an ok cd. it's nothing special. nothing you'll be like 'oh man! i can't wait for xmas! yes! rock and screamo!'i like maybe....5 songs on it? i guess i just like to think of christmas as the tradition happy go lucky celebrationoh and FFTL is terrible"
2,Smith & Wesson Galaxy 3 LED Flashlight (Black with 3 White LEDs),"Well built, but not very bright compared to my other flashlights. But probably fine considering the low price. Good light for the money."
5,The best tennis shoes for me!,"Unfortunately, the shoes I have ordered are not for sale anymore in The Netherlands. Don't ask me why, because only in the small town I am living in, more tennis players are interested in them. It could therefore well be that Amazon will receive more orders for them. With my relatively small and wide feet and my sensitive Achilles tendon, these shoes were by far the very best shoes I could find some years ago. I am very happy that Amazon still can deliver them and I have ordered two pair to make sure that I can play tennis for the next years to come."
1,Surely you jest....,"Why isn't there a 1/2 star rating available? Shouldn't the production of some CDs be declared an environmental hazard, if only because of the not so ""beautiful noise"" pollution? Seriously, Neil, thanks, but I don't think so."
1,I Don't Get It.,"I can't rightfully review this CD because I have a mental block. I don't think I hear Neil Diamond's music the way he intended for it to be heard. I feel like I'm missing some cochlia or that the nerves transmitting data from my ears to my brain that were intended by nature to interpret Mr. Diamond's music got fried somewhere along the way.He has millions upon millions of fans. He's sold a zillion records and his quarterly royalty checks are surely still among the biggest in the business even though he hasn't had a hit in 18 years. He packs 'em in at his concerts. He wrote all but one of his Top 40 hits.I don't know why I can't connect with this man's music. I feel deeply ignorant. I am absolutely baffled, asea, befuddled and astonished by his amazing, titanic, blockbuster successes. What is wrong with me? I don't get it.I don't get Natalie Merchant either, but that's another story."
3,Skimpy collection,"The tracks on this millennium collection are very similar to those on hisNeil Diamond - His 12 Greatest Hitsalbum. Still, they represent a particulaly fertile period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when his melodic prowess was at a peak on songs like Sweet Caroline, Cracklin' Rosie, Song Sung Blue and I Am I Said. A song like Holly Holy has a defnite spiritual undertone. This music demonstrates his authenticity as a major composer and consummate vocalist. Although the album provides a great listening experience, it is incomplete and does not even remotely represent all of his bst work from the 20th century."
3,Tim Powers early & very unpolished work.,This was the first sale by Mr. Powers & it shows. It is generic space fantasy with just a few hints of why his fans love his writing now. Established fans may find it an interesting contrast to his current style and skill
5,Brian White,"I'm a big fan of L.A. Guns & have 24 cds & 1 dvd of theirs. I was looking for bands that Phil Lewis had played in & Torme came up. I typed TORME up and lisended to them & sounded great. It has a mixe between the 70's sound & L.A. Guns sound. So what did I do, well, I ordered the cd & can't wait to play it. It should be comming in today. If a fan of PHIL LEWIS of L.A. GUNS or BERNIE TORME,should get this album & play it loud."
4,The Dwarf packs a punch!,I was in the audience for both of these operas and loved The Dwarf - there was complete silence when the curtain fell - no one was even breathing!! This opera was most enjoyable but the ending packs a punch to your head and your gut. Thank goodness we had The Broken Jug afterwards so we could leave the house happier than The Dwarf leaves you - a profound ending. I will add this DVD to my collection and highly recommend The Birds as well. Good productions and excellent performances! Thanks to James Conlon for bringing these operas to us for our enjoyment!
1,An experienced look,"I tried not to be overly objective and I also attempted to be open to the contents of this book, I still found some things very hard to swallow. I have not yet fully completed my reading, but I will tell you this...Satanism is not a mental disease. The mental disease area belongs to those who think as this book reads. I have been a Satanist my entire adult life. But to tell me that I have a mental disease not a relgion is just the same as saying that all Christians and Catholics are diseased. If you do read this book, just remember...those who write about what they do not know spead a sead of misinformation and seads of the brain if used unwisley can be very distructive. I will give you a full editorial when I am finished from cove to cover."
2,EH,"Reviews on here are definately written by the makers of this film. The film is unoriginal and not even that great production value. Found it really corney, and the special features are just the makers sitting in a chair giving advice that I had already known and I haven't even made a film yet... Could have been so much better, dissapointing."
1,Long past it's day,"Back in the day, this I'm sure was one rocking little device.It's well thought out and works well for what it is.Unfortunately it's slow as whale snot now."
3,Toddler Devotion,"said was in ""good"" condition, not so much, there were scribbles on pages and I overall was not impressed with the condition of this book. IF I would have seen before purchase, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,The poor authors,"They had a great idea for a book on politics beyond the Reign of W, spending the past couple of years assiduously putting together a slew of statistics to back up their professional analysis of current American politics.Then Karl Rove's brilliant strategy imploded, and the electorate turned on the administration, pretty well across the board, though with some demographics more strongly than others. So ... it's tough to extrapolate the pre-implosion data (pre-2004) to 2008 and beyond.The book went to press after the 2006 elections, and the authors do mention the results in the Foreward. However, I'm deducting two stars: one because it reads like a college statistics thesis in large part, and another because the data is (to some extent, debateable how much) not relevant for the next political cycle."
1,Picture on Front Best Part of Book,"Dont waste your money on this book, it is worthless in content. The description of it is so far off from what it really is, its some mottled jumbo of nothing of interest. The real basis of the book is not about jewels and charms or their magic either. Very hard to read and get the authurs reason for even writing the book. The title fools the buyer."
4,Works like a dream in FSX,"I think this joystick is possessed - I haven't crashed a plane yet in Flight Sim X!!!!! It is kind of odd how it turns off to save power if you are in mid-flight, but it makes sense and a click of the button will turn it back on without affecting the flight.Setup is easy but I didn't get any software with it (used) so I'm not sure exactly what software I'm supposed to be using with it. I installed Logitech software but it turns out to not detect the joystick. SO, Windows 7 can use it fine with the built in drivers and calibration works, so I'd recommend against the Logitech software.This is wireless, and has it's own USB dongle - it doesn't use the universal USB dongle. I haven't had a problem with it dropping movements or button presses from 6 feet away. It uses 3x AA batteries, and I have used it for approx 10 hours without changing them so far. Time will tell!"
1,LOGITECH FREEDOM 2.4 CORDLESS JOYSTICK,THIS JOYSTICK SOUNDS GREAT BUT FOR ME I COULDNT GET IT TO WORK WITH VISTA I TRYED EVERTHING SO I HAD TO RETURN IT N I GOT THRUSTMASTER WORKS GREAT WITH VISTA SO NO COMMENT ON LOGITECH JOYSTICK?
1,"Like the wireless, stick loses calibration","My stick has lost it's calibration after about 6 months. I tried the clear calibration utility from Logitech, but that does not work. The only thing that works is to unintall the logitech software, and go into the windows control panel under game controllers and recalibrate.The only problem with this is you will have to do this everytime you want to play a game, and sometimes in the middle of a game.I wouldn't recommend this stick to anyone."
2,Mass food with a cafeteria sensibility,"If you need to regularly cook for a camp, church gathering or a shelter this is the book. But for a small family that wants to save time and still eat interesting and healthy food this is not the book. I was very disappointed."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as good as the books.","I am a great fan of E.F. Benson and had high hopes for this video series unfortunately although the scenery is fantastic and the depiction of the villages of Risholm and Tilling look great the characters lose something in the translation of the material. The comedic timing is off and what would have you ""laughing out loud"" in the books comes across as frankly stupid and inept. The character of Georgie is particularly annoying...in the books he is quite the ""Nancy Boy"" but in the video's he is just plan sad...I am sure this whole series could have been portrayed better, perhaps with different actor's. Not worth the download."
3,Kind of Small,"My daughter got this last Christmas (05) and used it for the rest of the school year. We often had to swap it out for a larger book bag, as this one is very small. It would only hold 2 text books plus a notebook, and that would be cutting it close."
3,Did not speed up laptop!,"This has given me a lot more space to store stuff on my computer, but has not given me any more speed. I added memory with intent to add speed and that just didn't happen. I should have investigated a litle more to find the correct memory. Very easy to install!!"
1,Sorry - but this book misses the mark,"Very little real solutions...I don't know if the other reviewers read a different book than I did but honestly not that informative and has nothing ""new"" in it. Nothing in here that one couldn't figure out for oneself just by using common sense and having a better-than-rudimentary knowledge of the Internet."
5,Essential information for both recruiters and employers.,I found this book to be packed with tricks and techniques from which even the experienced Internet recruiter can learn. Definitely a must-have for a recruiter or business-owner's bookshelf. The section on writing a job post that gets results was particularly noteworthy.
4,Ox,"Wow. First off, El-p's production on here is nuts, matter of fact this has to be the best produced album of the year so far. I have never heard such drum placement like on ""rasberry fields"", and the production on ""iron galaxy"" is amazing as well. Let's not forget Vast and Vordul. Both paint vivid images of the hard city life in NY, as well as ""soaring above higher things"" (check pigeon, and the classic bonus cut, phoenix.) This should be in any hip hop fans collection."
4,Why didn't i give it 5 stars?,i feel that 5 star ratings are given to anything good these days. i was skeptical when i first heard this album but eventually it grew on me...it's quite good and isn't like many hip-hop albms out there. the rhymes are awesome but the beats are odd they take a while to get used to. it's worth getting your hands on just for the experience.
4,Cult Hip Hop!,This record is awesome. I don't really buy much hip hop records and only have been for three or four years but after listening to this one from a friend I bought the first copy I saw in a record store. I think the re-mix of 'The F-Word' is better than what is on the album but besides that everything else is a hard intergalactic experience of sound. So far everyone who has heard this album from me LOVES IT!
4,Whitey Likey.,"I hate when people say..""I dont usually like rap, but this was good""I guess i could say that right now in this case, because i really dont listen to that much hip hop... but i refuse..Its not just a good ""hip hop"" album...its a good ""album"" The beats rocked me real good, and when the disc stopped, i had another craving to listen again."
1,Performance Review of Philips MC235,"I purchased this unit 7-7-05 and it lasted almost one month. During the time it was working it did very well. Sound quality was very good, it is easy to operate, size is very convenient, I was quite happy with the MC235. Unfortunately I now have a monophonic unit. Apparantly the right stereo channel is not working. This unit was only used for a few hours daily. Consequently I must now send the unit off for repair. I am very disappointed with this situation. It is very unlikely that I would consider any Philips product in the future."
3,"Nice form factor, but short on functionality","I bought this unit to serve as a second sound system for my dining room. Compact, modern, and economical, it seemed to be a perfect solution. All worked well for 6 months, then the CD player started having play issues. The problem first began as glitches during play, slowly degrading into total shutdown. Simply put: CD players should not break in 6 months. The AM/FM radio still functions fine.I found this unit on sale, so it's not a huge deal to get another unit. However, I find it inexcusable for a firm like Philips to produce such a shoddy CD player, given how they're trying to gain market share in the US. Phillips, you'll have to improve to your QC to regain my trust."
3,"Students, watch out!","If you are a student in high school or college looking for a complete reference guide, this book is not it. The basics are covered, but explanations are sometimes inaccurate, and it will not supply answers to problems with your research paper(at least, not the answers that will satisfy your teacher). It IS a good reference tool for those in the corporate community who need help once in a while to polish a report, proposal or important memo."
3,It was alright.,"This book includes information on both FFV and FFVII. The information isn't that bad, but I felt that I was left hanging many times, especially in Final Fantasy V. The bestiaries are almost non-existent and there is no world map present in either game's section. This can be very disturbing. However, this is the only guide out there for this game, so I will sadly recommend it."
3,"Good writing, uninteresting conclusion","Kiernan's writing skills are quite good, but...Look, I hate books without a moral, end of argument. I don't like baddies to get away with it, and Dancy's fate... well, I would find it horrific. Kiernan writes from Stephen King's psychological standpoint, but in the Lovecraftian mode, and she generally pulls it off. But spooks on the side of the road are too literal. Consider HPL's ""Shadow over Innsmouth"": you can watch fish-people stumble over town all you like, but the only horror comes at the end, with the narrator's final, inward revelation.That's true horror."
2,BORING!!,I best describe this book as 85% boredom and 15% substance . . . try reading 'Exquisite Corpse' by Poppy Z. Brite or 'Frisk' by Dennis Cooper . . . no need to waste time with this one.
5,A beautiful book,"Not your usual style of horror, but, all the better a tale for that.Filled with such wonderful characters, that you'll still think of them long after you've finished the novel."
4,WOW!!!,I really enjoyed this book it was a breath of fresh air. Angel and Michael know from the moment that they met something was different. The fact that they fall in love is enevitable. The only reason i did not give this book a five is the ending was not the best. But i would recommend this book to anyone who wants a romance/sci-fi read.
2,Would you paint your head?,"I still can't figure out a practical use for this product. It rubs off on my pillow or washes off when wet. The rubbing off can be reduced by putting a coating of Aqua Net hair spray on your hair over it until it dries. I recommend people start by using a hair loss product like Rogaine or Ovation as directed until all gone so that your bald spot will be smaller, then start the Russell product. But covering your spot with a ink from a felt pen might not itch as much."
3,"The Best of the Trilogy, by a light year, and...","Jason & The Scorchers fans might like thisone as Jason himself has an unbilled cameoin it as Future Biff's head thug! The RockN Roll connection shouldn't faze fans of thegenre since Michael A. Fox (cousin of Andy,who played on Thunder And Fire)[Michael'sreal name, above, too] and Fox, who was abig fan of Cheap Trick's ""always on MTV""stuff of that period, had a Van Halen soloin the cassette in the ""Darth Vader fromPlanet Vulcan"" scene with Krispin Gloverin the First installment of this Series**.5 stars). B-T-T-F II was fimed at thesame time as Back to the Future III (**.5stars as well) but is better than it's pre-decessor and follow-up because of the timetravel (to 2015 - Miami winning the WorldSeries[ today kids, that's the Florida Mar-lins, who actually won in '97 and '03], andback to 1955). Best of the trilogy. Get it!"
2,This is why sequels SUCK!!!,"BTTF part II is a poor followup to Back To The Future. All the charm, warmth and humor of Back To The Future isn't here. The plot is convoluted and unpleasant and the acting isn't as good as Back To The Future. Michael J Fox clearly has lost all his 80's charm. He is in no way as appealing as he was in Back To The Future."
3,Not for an 8GB Nano!,I was just upset because I couldn't use it. It didn't specify that it wasn't for an 8GB Nano. I bought it and had to return it. I'm sure the product is fine. Steve Michelson
4,"A very well written book on EBE's, UFO's and History.","This is a very well written book that links the EBE and ET contact information toward the historical abnormalities. This book serves as a fine introduction for those who are not aware of the Zecharia Sitchin, series of writings. The writer makes some good points and ties some interesing information together in ways not done elsewhere. If you believe that human civilization began 5000 years ago, and did not involve ET intervention, then this book will not be for you. But if you believe that our universe is teeming with life, then read this book. It will answer many questions and open your mind into areas worthy of investigation."
4,The Sirius Mytery; much more than another UFO book,"The Sirius Mystery surprised me. I'm on the fence about UFOs but Temple provided a different angel to consider. I really enjoyed it as a deep reading ancient history and comparative religions geek. Aliens aside, this study is a detailed tour of how western and near east peoples at the beginning of recorded history were interconnected, more advanced than generally known, and deeply interlaced. Take out the aliens and you have a damn good overview accounting of the intermixing of religions and cultures. I don't think Temple proved his premise but he has proven to be a real scholar with the ability to connect the dots. This book, with tons of foot notes, references and quoted scholars, can be dry reading but any geek interested in ancient history will love it. Light UFO reading, it is not. Readers with some knowledge of Greek, Egyptian, Minoan, and Babylonian history/archeology will appreciated it most."
2,Not what I expected.......in a bad way,"I read the first 100 pages of the book and couldn't take it anymore. His goal is to confuse the reader by mentioning them names of numerous gods and goddess from all kinds of different ancient civilizations it was hard to keep track of them. Show me more physical evidence of contact with an alien civilization. All Temple does is expand on other peoples work for evidence, he does not go to the actual sights himself to investigate, if you are interested in ancient history conspiracys I would say read any of Graham Hancock's books, way more thorough, the writing was way more organized and entertaining. And he goes to the actual historical sights for his investigations.You know this is a hard book to read and understand when the author has to put summaries at the end of the chapter, to help you try and understand what he was writing!"
1,I would give it no stars but I couldn't post my review with none!!,"I received the battery I purchased in packaging that was like new, however, the battery didn't hold a charge at all and had to be returned. The policy of this vendor is that they don't take back defective items so I had to return it to the manufacturer and I still haven't received the replacement (several weeks now)."
4,countdown to infinite crisis,"I've never been a big fan of the Spectre or Captain Marvel (Shazam!). But magic (and the spiritual world) play a big part of the DC universe, and apparently what happens in Infinite Crisis affects magic (though I don't know the IC story yet...that's coming up soon for me). It actually is a pretty good story, though it contains few DC folks I care about (though Superman is found in the beginning). Very important to understand the DC world after IC."
5,Excellent Product. - Great for Musician's.,"I ordered the Belkin Tunetalk about 2 months ago, and it's been great. I purchased it to use recording voice lessons, and music rehearsals, and it's been fantastic. The built in level function on the mic keeps things from overloading even in a full blown opera rehearsal, and it is still sensitive enough to pick up what the conductor says at 60+ feet away. In voice lessons/coaching sessions, it picks up both piano and voices clearly without drowning one or the other out.I've even begun using it just a a personal voice recorder for memo's and reminders. It's great. The one drawback is the limit of 90 minutes battery time.The USB pass through is great. The interface is childishly easy, and works smoothly and effortlessly with iTunes. Highly recommend."
5,Super easy recording,"A friend of mine had one of these and I used it to record some stuff for her and fell in love with it. I just bought one for myself and am really happy with it. It's so easy to use, you just plug it into your ipod and choose record from the menu that automatically comes up. When you are done, choose stop and save or cancel. It's as easy as that! Then when you sync your ipod, the recordings show up in your itunes!"
4,Does the job nicely,"Easy to set up and use, integrates well with iTunes and GarageBand (to edit recordings), and has very good pickup and sound quality, even 6+ feet from the interview subject."
4,Excellent microphone,"I've used a few different recording systems on my iPods but this one has had great results mainly because I can use it with another professional lapel mic plugged into it. So I guess I use it as an enabler for a pro lapel mic. It's a really convenient size too. I have used it by itself and it still seems okay although the distance from voice to recorder makes a difference - the further away the voice is, the recording level and quality drops off quite fast. That's where a mic that plugs into the TuneTalk is important for my use - if you want to record a presentation in a room it's okay but not ideal. Also, for some reason, I've had a couple just stop working after a while - I buy a new one to replace it, but I think it should last longer, and it's really inconvenient when it doesn’t give any advance indications, just doesn’t record suddenly. All in all I'd recommend this for anyone doing voice recordings at close range where it is excellent."
4,Choppie,"As a musician, TuneTalk is definitely a good device for those who already owns an iPod, using it to record band practices and live recording thru the mixer (Line-in). The quality of the recording is great. I did hear from other reviews saying that TuneTalk is so sensitive that you'll hear the harddrive spinning when you record thru the mic. IMO, if you record live... the mic will definitely pick up other sound too and you seriously won't use this mic to record something that you'll publish anyway...and, if no one told you about it... you wouldn't have noticed it! Besides, If you use the line-in option, you won't hear the harddrive spinning! I think the only minus is... you can't really listen the recording while it's being recorded. But overall, it's a great on-the-road recorder for all iPod-owners."
1,what does GLEN CAMPBELL have to do with rock and roll?,GLEN CAMPBELL IS A COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYER NOT ROCK
2,Could be better!,"The description said you can fit 2 Game Boy Advance cartridges in each case. I couldn't figure out how someone could get two in there - I could only fit one, and it seemed like the case should have been a smidge deeper to properly fit them. It's also pretty hard to open, which would be frustrating for kids who want to grab a game and start playing!"
4,Nice and Sturdy but...,The paint was a little sloppy and the instructions weren't very clear. You do have trim the stickers but that wasn't a big deal as we only used a few of them. My three year old daughter can't quite figure out how to pedal it (even though she can pedal tricycles and big wheels fine) but it't definitely too small for anyone over 5. Otherwise it's cute and sturdy and a keeper for the price.
5,Awesome and Excited,Well we got the pink pedal car on Monday. My husband opened it Monday night to make sure it was all there. It is all there. It is in mint condition. We can't wait to put it together on Christmas Eve and watching my daughter's face when she sees it on Christmas morning under the Tree.Thanks for the fast service. We wouldn't mind doing service with you again in the future.thanks againThe Morris Family
5,GOD'S RX FOR WORKPLACE TRIALS,"TODAY GOD IS FIRST is my first of the morning vitamin to set my frame of mind for the challenges faced in the marketplace daily.Os Hillman's capability to present the everyday personal trials we all face in the public arena in perspective of how God might handle them is truly unique. TGIF is the WWJD answer in book format.The examples and situations he presents are so real and memorable that you will likely find yourself relating them to others. Or, better yet, buying copies to share because EVERYONE can relate and comfortably absorb the experiences he shares in this book.TGIF really relates so much to everyday life, you will find yourself looking repeatedly for the nourishment this book gives for helping you put on ""the full armour of God"" to tackle what lies ahead of each and every day. This book blesses us to keep on going, pressing ahead to do God's will."
1,Lie,The list of tracks on the site was completely wrong and not what I was looking for. I want my money back.
5,what love?????,"This book is my fav. book. I mean I like the fact that conner&liz is together and conner is takin' it well.But the whole jess&will, not gonna last .I mean will is a controll freak and the only person that will stand it is that no good loser melissa!!!and jess flirts with jermey at a party???oh yeah ,and ms.tia gose and cheat on angel, has she lost her mind.Just read # 16 she gose for conner!!!!!u gotta get this book!!!"
2,Slightly disappointed,"I should have realized i'd get what i paid for. these subs are rated for 500w a piece. I bought a high end infinity 1000w mono amp with built in fan at best buy to power these which should be more than adequate to power these subs. however, they hit like i've got them hooked to a 300w amp. these subs are POWER HOGS. i'm guessing it would at least 1500w to power them like normal subs but all the extra work and $ you would have to put in to make these perform correctly, you could get some higher end subs instead."
1,DONT BUY !!! BEWARE!!! JUNK!!!!,"I MUST SAY, THIS IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF EVER . I THOUGHT THE SUBS WERE PRETTY NICE WHEN I FIRST OPENED THE BOX TO FIND OUT A FEW DAYS LATER THEY JUST WONT TURN ON FOR NO APPARENT REASON! IM VERY DISSAPOINTED THAT I BOUGHT THIS JUNK !!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING BETTER THEN THIS , AMAZON SHOULD NOT SELL JUNK LIKE THIS ."
5,Excellent!,This is really a good introduction for any student wishing to pursue a high-level career in computer science. A must-read.
1,Expensive Paperweight,"Like many reviewers, I too had to buy this book for a cs class. It is one of the most worthless books I've ever owned. The treatment of the material was flimsy at best. A math textbook usually is replete with many examples, but this one leaves most of the examples as homework exercises. Most of the examples are easy, but the homework exercises are cryptic and difficult. It would have been helpful to include some difficult problems in the examples as well. Unless you have a very good instructor to give adequate examples, I would stay away from this book or look for supplemental material."
1,LISTEN UP!!!,"As much as we all complain, we will still purchase whatever is released if we want it bad enough. So THANK YOU Paramount for leading me on the path to financial ruin. Gotta have Mason."
1,give the consumer a break with this!!,"This is my all-time favorite TV Show next to MURDER SHE WROTE and thanks to Universal, they know how to market by releasing a whole season in one complete box set...unlike Paramount Home Video releasing PERRY MASON in pieces!! Give the consumer a break with this Season 1, Part 1, Season 2, Part Two, etc... Release the whole season together...the consumer is gonna buy it anyway...why make us wait? At the rate you're going the whole nine seasons will be released in nine years! This is ludicrous! Nobody is going to buy this new anniversary edition if it is not new unreleased material from Seasons 3--9."
1,Daylight robbery,Why don't the studio come out with the complete collection instead? That would be a much better way to celebrate the 50th anniversary!
2,needed my fix,"I didn't want to but going through Perry and Della withdrawals, I broke down and bought this set. I enjoyed it more than I thought as the extras were a lot of fun to watch. It is also nice to see Barbara Hale introduce the shows. She looks and sounds great. After viewing about three quarters of the extras, I do recommend this to fans.I am however miffed at the dvd producers for not giving us more. I have heard Season 3 vol 1 is coming in August but why the slow pace? The series sets have no extras and no music right issues. It is frustrating to see some lesser know series come out in rapid succession while Perry Mason releases dribble out. It leaves the comsumers to wonder if the production will continue. Anyone have any insight into this?"
5,"La Traviata, Giusepe Verdi","Verdi's wonderful masterpiece La Traviata is among opera's greatest works.A great score, it's easy to read and a standard size (9in x 12in). It's a great low price, perfect for the starving music student. It lies flat on a desk or music stand for easy study. I highly reccommend this for professionals and opera-goers alike."
1,Toshiba does not honor their warranty,"I bought this laptop for my husband less than ayear ago. He carries it back and forth to work ina rigid case. A few months ago, the LCD screen began to fail,with a line of dark blue runningacross the screen diagonally.It has spread to wherethe screen is unusable. Toshiba refuses to replacethis piece of hardware, despite it still beingunder warranty, because it is ""damaged.""Isn't the point of having a laptop to be able tocarry it with you? How can general use of thescreen be damaging to a computer? Clearly, the coverto this unit, while very thin and attractive, isway too flexible to support the screen properlywhen opening and closing it. Less than a year old,and Toshiba won't replace it.I spent a total of 2 hours trying to speak with a customer support person,and when I finally got one on the phone,she was the rudest person I've ever dealt with.Toshiba flat out refuses to honor their warranty. Don't buy from them."
2,not heavy duty for daily use,"after tow weeks of use, the device give me wrong test. It is good for tracing the network cable & coaxial. But I think it is not heavy duty."
3,Not big enough,"This system was not big enough for my Yamaha RX-V757 reciever. The depth of the glass was not big enough, and the glass can only hold 25lbs, the receiver is 29lbs."
3,Decent but not great,"I was hoping for something a little better built. It does work, and installation was easy but I don't like the fact that it swivels without a way to lock it into one position.This unit is also not made for anything very heavy. It says its rated for 25#'s a shelf, but I have a 24.5# reciever and I am a little worried about it.It does look cool, but is lacking in durability and function. Good for lightweigt things only."
4,Satisfactory,"I received the item in a timely manner. It was exactly as discribed. It fits well with my componets and the swivel makes it easier to get behind the compents to connect wires etc. The only draw back were the two molded end caps which one is suppose to slid on the top of the bar and the other on the bottom it's more for decortive purposes. It doesn't fit very well tends to fall off. You've got to kind of catch it right in order to try to snap it on, it's not easy but it'll be fine but you really can leave them off and it's looks just find. . Otherwise this is a good product with easy installation instuctions, really simply and easy. If you have a home theater system as I do, the shelf be a bit longer as the home theater receiver is longer than the shelf it hangs over slightly but it works out fine."
5,Pleased,I love it !!! I listened to this CD from beginning to end with my husband and it brought back great memories of when we lived in Denver.
3,CD is okay but I expected a little bit more.,"The only reason I got this CD because of the remake of a Stevie Wonder classic ""Knocks me off my Feet"" I remember this song back in the early 90's and had an extended version, I was disappointed with this particular track considering what I remember back in the day, EMI records should have done a better job in releasing this track, hopefully in the future some company will rerelease a cd singles version of this song..., but who knows."
5,buy this or die,this cd is so killer. this cd should be in every metal heads collection. this is my favorite album from a melodic death metal band. this is how music should be played. (in flames take not you sell outs) this cd makes me want to just go to another world when i hear this. i will tell you this if you dont buy this then you should stop listening to metal. every song is a great one. keep rocking guys. go buy this at theendrecords.com.
3,Change purse,"It's a little larger than the one it replaced, but is not as adaptable as that one. Why, I don't know."
4,Pretty good...,Does the job... seems a little cheaply built though. Don't buy it if you expect to be putting it through heavy wear and tear.
1,DON'T buy this book,"instead you should search for the handbook of kana and kanji written and published by the same company. I did the mistake of buying this one and it have got less useful in learning then the handbook have gotten to me. As this book is in 2 parts and doesn't contain the same amount of kanji(obvoiusly as it's 2 volumes) and doesn't explain in ca 30 pages about kanji as the handbook does this is a bad chooise. This book doesn't include the jinmei-yo kanji that are used for name either but the handbook does. The handbook have a better register.And the best thing about the Handbook is that it: COST LESS I say it again ""THE HANDBOOK COST LESS"" then this bookThis book is a bad buy belive me. the only the book does have is some small aquares to practice in as you can do the same thing on a colleige block you will not need the squares provided by this book and the squares is to few in number anyway.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!"
3,Social Realities,This book is a good source to read about different social realities that go on in life. It will give the reader a good picture what goes on in these situations.
3,Good as a reference not for learning,"This is a good book if all you need is a condenced reference on theorems and proofs and it assumes that you go for practice (and instruction) elsewhere. If you are trying to actually learn linear algebra (especially on your own and especially if you want to learn how to solve practical problems) get one of Gilbert Strang's books and watch his videolectures at MIT web site. Another thing that I dislike about the Gelfand's book is that it puts too much emphasis on index notation - instead of matrix notation wich is natural for linear algebra, almost all formulas and theorems are presented at very low level using expressions consisting of variables with multiple indices. Naturally it gets very messy and hard to follow at times. This doesn't present any more information than equivalent matrix notation but introduces unnecceccary complexity and makes things that are really easy to understand very confusing."
2,Very Small,This is a well built product but it will just hold your camera and batteries. It will not handle the cables needed to support the camera or the power supply which is a must in most cases. The batteries don't last long enough for most outings. It is basically the size of a small hardcovered novel!
2,Confusing Game,This game was confusing even for several adults to try to figure out. A waste of money in my opinion.
4,Lovely,"Few typos throughout this kindle version. Otherwise, its a nice story. For those unaccustomed to ms hill, you might find it a bit slow. The books are generally always happy-ending, no drama, no major conflict types but always heavy on Christian living and teach a valuable lesson that still applies to Christians today. They are generally sweet, easy reads. This one has been one of my favorites, since i work with kids and find myself partial to boys. Through victoria's eyes and story, she really shows the hurt and tough lives that a kid can face. I love how she so willingly served the Lord by reaching out to these unloveable boys that society has written off. A light, charming read which will suit you, especially if you love working with kids or have a heart for reaching others"
3,Slow,I love the story line and purpose in this book but it was just too slow moving! I became attached to the characters but almost quit reading because I was bored!
4,The Obsession of Victoria Gracen,Just good old fashion morals. These were the only romance books I could read when younger. Gives you a 'feel good' feeling after reading.
3,Obsession of Victoria Gracen,I have read many of Grace Livingston's books. Life has changed very much since Grace has written her books. I enjoyed this book although it seemed unreal to today's standards. I would recommend this book for teenagers especially. I wish life was as simple as depicted in this book.
2,The Obsession of Victoria Gracen,The story is difficult to follow and seems like you are just plodding through it. It is most likely me but I'm obsessed with Historical Fiction so I've read enough to judge the genre.
5,inspiring,I like the way the characters grow and bond together. It is an old fashioned book that entertains and encourages.
5,Blessed,"A touching and beautiful story of hope, changes and best of all... love. Highly recommend for those seeking something deeper."
1,Does not get hot enough,This curliong iron does not heat up enough to curl longer hair. I am returning it.
3,Caution,"I do like this curling iron. The cord does not twist, which is great! The problem I have with it is that it burns whatever it sits on. It left burn marks on my bathroom sink because it does not have anything preventing it from laying directly on the surface. I have to put a towel underneath it so I do not ruin the sinktop anymore that it is."
3,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","Purchased two of these adapters (I tend to lose things) for use in car as well as a cheap boombox. Both of the tapes make a sort of gear, grinding sound (plastic against plastic) which, though soft, can get really annoying. Luckily, the one I've used in the car seems to have decreased in the amount of noise it makes and I hope it will continue to do so. Using one of these adapters inside the boombox is simply unbearable, the noise the cassette makes while playing is much more distracting since it is adjacent to the speakers.I'm no audiophile, but I would describe the fidelity of the adapter as ""acceptable."" It's not bad, but probably muffles the sound of my mp3 player more than I realize.While these adapters aren't great, they're not expensive and if you can combine shipping with something else, it might be worth it. However, if you have to pay shipping for this item alone, I would recommend finding a better option."
4,a lovely kid,"Since I bought the CD-2-Cassette adaptor, I have enjoyed and am enjoying my sweetness songs in my car. This adaptor works wonderfully. I love it."
1,Ancient Astronauts - Extra Terrestrial Legacy,"If you are thinking of buying this DVD, don't. It is a very amateur video of a stage speech, unedited for DVD. The speakers seem unprepared, visuals are childlike overhead projections, sound quality is very bad, often fading. Some of the information is interesting but nothing that someone who is truly interested in this subject does not already know. There are much more worthy DVD's on offer - such as the Ancient Alien Series 1, 2 & 3"
3,Good and Bad,"I purchased a pair of these shorts about 6 years ago from another retailer and wanted a second pair because I liked them so much. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the second pair. Old Glory didn't ship them well and they were of a lesser quality than the first pair. I would have bought from the same retailer, but these shorts are discontinued. Old Glory wouldn't offer a discount to me when I wrote them an email to complain about the quality."
3,Are there any round kickballs out there?,"I bought these hoping they weren't like the kickballs in the store that aren't perfectly round. The storebought balls get egg shaped within a few weeks of use. Because the balls come deflated, I was hoping I could air them up to prevent the egg shape. That didn't happen with all of them. Some are round right now but I'm not holding my breath."
1,total crap,"Got these balls fast, but one came with a hole in it, one cracked when inflated, and two cracked in a couple of weeks. This order was a complete waste of money."
3,Great price but several defective,I bought 24 of these as giveaway gifts for a child's birthday party. They were a big hit except for the fact that 4 of them didn't hold air for longer than a day.
4,The start of a good one,I got interested in bloodrayne 2 when my friend bought it for his PS2. But with me I'm not into council games so when I found out it was available for PC you could only imagine my delight. One thing led to another and after finishing that I wanted to play the original Bloodrayne but was told it was no longer in print so I decided to try online. The two games are somewhat the same but I found the Originals ending to be a much harder fight and took me several attempts to defeat it.
5,This is a great video!,"I bought this video after reading all of the reviews good and bad, mostly because she is teaching some of my favorite Nancy songs, and I just had to have it. Some people have found it to be unhelpful but I don't see why. She shows you everything by hand, close up and finger by finger. And if you really can't catch that, it's all noted in super easy guitar tab in the little book that's provided. If this had been available when I was trying to teach myself to play guitar 30 years ago, I never would have quit. Because I would have been having far too much fun, (like I am now.)Plus she includes a few alternate tunings to play around in, finger picking styles to play with and brief but inspiring looks into 12 string and mandolin. We get the Battle of Evermore for mandolin.She can't make you practice enough to be a good player, but she absolutely shows you how to play her songs featured on this dvd. All we need now is her follow up dvd:) Hint, hint, Nancy."
2,Returned this camera to Wal-Mart twice,"I recieved this camera for Christmas and was delighted. It is very easy to use and I didn't need to read through complicated instruction manuals. However, it sure did use up a lot of batteries. I even bought rechargeable batteries, which only lasted for about an hour.However, after using the camera for about a month the LCD viewer stopped working properly (lots of lines through it)and I returned it to Wal-Mart for an exchange.After owning the camera for another 3-1/2 months, I noticed that the area around the most frequently used button (for displaying the pictures)CRACKED! The button was no longer functional. I again returned the camera to Wal-Mart for an exchange. Now, after reading the other reviews, I have decided to return it a third time for a store credit and get a different camera.I would NOT recommend buying this camera."
3,Use 3 days to trouble shoot the connecting the serial cable,"When I got this camera,it is nice looking and worth buying. I took many nice pictures. One day,the memory is full and I want to upload the photos to my computer. Problems came! I tried to disconnect my mouse and plug in the serial cable. I installed the software and connect the serial cable.I couldn't success,a dialogue box came out saying it was not connected correctly.I kept on trying for 3 days with different ways upload and download the software and checked many many times for the connection of the serial cable.It was failed until now. I don't want to give up.If anybody knows the problem,please help and post it to amazon and let me know. It was a present from my mother.She brought it in Amazon and send it to Hong Kong for me.The customer support here couln't answer my question.I don't want her to be disapointed. Thank you very much! Why didn't polaroid use an USB insted of a serial port?"
1,Not so great,"This book (despite being a 2nd edition) is full of blatant typos and errors. In addition, the author seems to know just enough to hack projects together but not quite enough to write a book. There are many factual errors and misleading opinions.This book is really just a small collection of specific PIC projects the author somehow managed to get working. If one of the projects (as presented) is useful to you, perhaps the price of the book is justified. Otherwise, you're better off with back issues of your favorite electronics magazine. As a general introduction to microcontrollers this book doesn't even come close. If you're interested specifically in the PIC series, you're much better off with one of the David Benson books. If you're interested in other microcontrollers, keep looking..."
1,Outrageous price!,"I rated this for price only. The product is great and my squirrels (and birds too) love it. However, $8.99 for a 2 pack is more than TWICE as much as they cost elsewhere."
5,Experience Pound and Beers,"Joe Gross's lyrics combined with Dan Diaz on percussion, Adam Main on guitar and Levi Strickland on bass create a sound with lingering greatness. This is a band that will go far. Joe says it best in ""Experience"": ""Experience has made me wise when I look up at a new day I put my hands before my eyes the future looks dim but it's sink or swim"" I believe that this cd did not sink, but is swimming along with the best of them. ""The boys'll mix some spirits with their souls tonight"" (""Edinboro"") Songs like ""Love you yesterday"" and ""Last of a Dying Breed"" keep repeating in my mind until I must listen again to the cd. This is a must have."
4,dynamic becoming Brucelee book,I will say that the dynamic becoming Brucelee book is a good book on BL the Brucelee book called understanding jkd by Jason p Korol is one of the best!books out good price also.
4,Lacks sense of place,"Correctimundo that this would make an excellent movie, per other reviews, and it's a suspenseful ""good read"" as they say. A real page-turner, it has plot-twists that keep the reader wondering. However -- it also make you wonder if the author has ever been to any of the locales Jesse Warden and other characters visit. Although catalogued as having an Idaho setting, the country around the fictional locale of the Aryan Universe is nothing like that described, and you get no feel for Idaho at all. Cult-members fly into Tacoma's Narrows Airport, which IS NOT on one of the ""many small islands in Puget Sound."" When Jesse Warden flies commercial to Washington DC, he has business in College Park Maryland and then a quick return to ""Idaho."" But he uses Washington National and Dulles airports, which are in Virginia, while College Park is just 25 miles down US Route 1 from Baltimore-Washington International. Author Woods lives in Santa Fe -- a small town in West Virginia's Pocono Mountains."
4,quite good,first stuart woods book i've read and it quite good. the plot is very addictive and easy to follow. its easy to read and although i noticed many flaws the book was nice.
4,Fast-Paced Thriller Delivers The Goods,"HEAT is phenomenally entertaining, thanks to adrenaline-rush pacing, intriguing plot developments, and a sense of immediacy too few novels are able to elicit. The overall storyline is far from inspired, yet Stuart Woods has developed his material extraordinary well. And he has a lead character in Jesse who's ingratiating, brave, and completely identifiable -- he's a pleasure to ride along the story with. The last quarter or so is the weak link, though, tying up the story components too mechanically and unsatisfyingly. Never mind that -- this is a thriller of the highest order."
5,Feel the Heat,Great story with fast paced action and some great characters. One of Stuart Woods' best non-Stone Barrington stand alone books.
5,Award winning book explores trading among Native Americans,"This colorful book uses a story of a Navajo weaver and her granddaughter to convey Navajo culture and history. The Chief is a northern Plains Indian, who trades with the Navajo, one often overlooked aspect of Native American history. Winner, Border Regional Library Association's 1998 Southwest Book Award."
2,Get on with it,"There have only been a couple of times I had to stop reading a book half way through because it was just too boring. This was one of them.It started great. I was excited that it seemed so good in the beginning. The woman's story of the nazi occupation was what got this two stars. After that, however, it just went downhill. Actually, I take that back, it didn't go anywhere. There's more pointless dialog in this book than a soap opra. Maybe it's just not my taste, but I found this book untollerabley boring."
5,work great for my pooch,"These were perfect for my dog. Living in the city, icy salty sidewalks hurt her paws. These were great to protect them and they lasted much longer than rubber booties she's had before"
2,Mixed feelings,"This is both a good and bad product. The armor for the body is well designed and helps the D60, which is smaller than a normal SLR, feel more comfortable in my large hands. The lens armor is VERY POORLY designed. It slips off the lens easily and, most importantly, whoever designed it, never tried using it with the flash. IT BLOCKS THE LIGHT FROM THE FLASH so that every picture shot with flash has a dark circle at the bottom. I end up leaving it off the camera most of the time."
3,Not a purchace I would have made in person,"Nice knife. Interesting minimalist design and blade lock. A little heavy and a little expensive all things considered. Why, if you are going to make a ported blade and handle would you make it so the holes did not line up when folded? Kind of defeats the purpose - hence the 3 stars. Maybe it is an artistic thing."
1,I feel duped...and cheated,"I have seen these prep bowls offered by different vendors in sets of 4, but, I wanted 6 so I went with this vendor.The photo shows the plastic lids with which all the others ship. Mine had NO LIDS.Five bucks each for such teeny tiny little bowls is way too expensive. That there were SUPPOSED to be tight fitting plastic lids was what made me override my more practical side and order these bowls because I wanted to get my mis en place together.Anyway, why show a photo with the plastic lid if you aren't selling the lids with the bowls? To me, this definitely feels like BAIT AND SWITCH.I bought bowls with lids and I paid for bowls with lids. What I got sent was bowls...no lids.***************************************************************************EDITED Jan. 23, 2011 After I contacted Vendor, Vendor did send plastic lids, but, THEY DID NOT FIT the bowls. Vendor must be using a different supplier of bowls.BUY FROM SOMEONE ELSE. These are a RIP OFF!"
5,Great First Year text...,This book is perfect for introductory German in college. Werba has also written an intermediate German text.
3,Ok,"This is a very light peach color, when I apply it I can not tell that it is peach. The shadow does last when applied but looks like calk on my skin. So I use it as a highlighter which works well."
2,"Revlon Matte Eye Shadow, Pink Innocence",Revlon pink innocence eye shadow is nice for those who don't want a deep dark brow color. I found it not dark enough for my taste thought. I bought this to accent maybelline's expert eyewear nutmeg color eye shadow for my lids. It is good quality and Revlon DOES NOT test on animals so it was a perk that I buy it for that reason too.
5,After Dark with Zoot,"Zoot Sims could blow. He could swing with the best tenor sax players and his ballads are played with lots of soul and feeling. I am not a Zoot Sims authority, but I know what I like. I like this album and you will too if you enjoy top of the line tenor sax and a varied set that show the skills of a tenor sax player whose name is not a household word. And that's a shame for those who haven't listened to him late at night with a glass of wine."
2,There is nothing wrong with Tracie's voice..,but this album did not do anything for me. All the songs sounded alike to me.
3,She was the GIRL back in tha day,"Tracie was such a role model when this album was released. She had talent and mass appeal. I miss that in today's teen market.She was an award winning songwriter for the hit single ""Tender Kisses"" which is still impressive for a young black woman. I loved that song when I was getting tenderly kissed in those days. This album is dated for the most part but the nostalgia factor is high enough for a buy and a listen if you are of those who Tracie moved and got moving back in the early 90's"
4,"More Flaming Carrot trade paperbacks, please!","I wasn't too familiar with the Flaming Carrot before I ordered this but I took a shot. Funny,funny stuff. Few comics make me laugh out loud but this one did. Flaming Carrot and his superhero friends, the Mystery Men, are treated as ""B"" super heros in the world of comics. Anyone who is a fan of The Tick would get a hoot out of the Flaming Carrot."
1,They don't last,"I have 2 of these that came with the drill, about 3yrs ago, now neither holds a charge. The ones that came with the Dewalt (same age) are fine."
5,Does what it's supposed to do,I don't see much point in writing a review about a cable because it'not like it does more than what one would expect. If you need a 10ft male to male VGA cable this will do just fine.
2,"Works, but poor video quality","I bought this cable simply to connect my computer for the monitor. Video shows up fine, but was noticeably blurry. I eventually got used to that and then noticed that light objects on dark background appear to have been smeared. I switched to another vga cable I was using elsewhere and voila. No more blurry display, no more smeary images. I can only conclude that this is a low quality product. Don't be tempted by the price. Spend 5-10 more dollars on a higher quality cable."
1,Only 5 of the 15 pins are connected to anything!,"I am using this cable to connect my laptop to my 720p HDTV. With any other cable in the house, my laptop detects my unusual monitor resolution (1360x768) and allows me to select it appropriately in the display settings. With this cable however, the correct resolution isn't even an option. I tested each of the 15 pins, and only 5 of them are connected to anything! I know VGA cables don't need all 15 pins, but when I use a cable that has all 15 pins connected everything works fine. For my application this cable is completely worthless."
4,"Good deal, but it wasn't what I needed","It was a good deal, I won't complain about that. But, this cable wasn't what I needed. Turns out that my TV has a RGB input, not a VGA input. They look the same, but they aren't the same. Beware of this if you are looking to use this to connect your computer to your TV."
4,Good value,"For the price the monitor cable performs its function.Apparently the cable I was shipped had an audio link cable built into the monitor cable (obviously different from stated item on Amazon!). I never knew that this type of combo cable existed, but I was pleasantly surprised to have received the addition. Both audio and video work great on my Sharp 26"" LCD HDTV.Biggest qualm? The connector heads are so big that they block the Kensington port on my laptop. Comparable monitor cables have slimmer and less boxy heads. But what the comparable monitor cables don't have is a slimmer price :)"
3,product did not work but good service,I previously wrote a bad review because I received the VGA cable and it did not work. The company immediately contacted me and gave me a refund. I appreciate their concern.
1,Doesn't work,This cable did not work with my Inspiron laptop and Vizio TV. I had to send it back. Bought a different cable from target and it worked fine.
3,Streaming videos,"This cable is a ""EXCELLENT!"" choice if you have a 120hz LCD-LED, it's a great deal to buy this cable. It brings out this HD in video clips of up coming movies and games, and perheps your graphic card you have for you computer."
2,Dissatisfied,"The product was working fine initially after I connected to my TV. However with the my dell laptop, the image was flickering on my TV. Although I did not care much, after a month, one fine morning the TV image got blurred and finally got black. Amazon was kind enough to take the product back since the return period lapsed just by 2 days, so made the exception. I will not recommend this product since its not reliable."
2,"it works, but poor quality","The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars vs. 1 is because it does work. I have a 1080p HDTV that I use as a large CPU screen. This VGA cable gives a slightly blurry image for text, while the VGA cable that came with my LG cpu screen is crystal clear. Also, the connecting ends are very poor quality. They're slightly bent and don't screw in very well"
2,Poor Quality Cable - Better Off Spending More,"I'm not an expert but the problem may come down to how much surrounding interference you've got that's likely to effect a cheap cable that's not adequately shielded. I ran mine through a rat's nest of power cords for four machines with audio and external drive cables in there as well. I've also got two pairs of fairly heavy Altec Lansing speakers alongside the monitor.The resulting signal was seriously ghosted to the point where it bothered my eyes after a couple of hours.To compare, I brought home a VGA cable from work and was shocked at the difference running along the same path. Not only is the picture crisp but the colors are richer.I wish I could recommend the cable from work but I've no idea who makes it - we're a Dell shop and it's got those blue plugs that look like the cables that ship with Dells."
1,"doesn't work with my Samsung 23"" HDTV","This cable doesn't work at all when I try to connect my Acer computer to my new Samsung HDTV. It's definitely the cable, since I just got a new cable from Radio Shack and it works fine."
1,Fuzzy display!,"Ok. So I bought this after breaking my old cable (from shoving it in too forcefully!) The price appealed to me so I figured why not. Looks identical to my old one, the only problem is it gave a ""shadow"" effect as someone previously mentioned that just WON'T GO AWAY. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm extremely disappointed."
3,review,"A very good connector,It was delivered in the time stated.But connection pin quality could improve, ""the kind of ones where the plastic slips off"",but as you know messing with vga cables.But you can easily fix and make the connection pins totally secure with a hot glue gun or high strength adhesive, about 2-3 minutes work,And for the price this is a great cable,The pins only hold the cable to the vga connector and i said you can fix this problem by yourself in 2 to 3 minutes.Great deal and good buy."
1,Awful product--spend a few extra dollars,"You may be thinking what i was thinking when i ordered this cable. ""It's a VGA cable--yeah it's cheap, but how can you screw up a VGA cable? It can't be any worse than the one that came for FREE in the box with my monitor, right?""Yes, it can.Running this cable to my new 27 inch LCD monitor, I saw very bad ghosting (think of the images your inkjet printer produces when the heads are dirty or it's running out of ink). I had actually never seen this before on any VGA-fed monitor, because i had never encountered a cable this bad. I know it wasn't a monitor or computer problem because both the cable that came with the monitor and the longer cable i bought to replace this one yield a crisp, ghost-free image. Amazon was good about reimbursing my purchase price and shipping charges, but save yourself the time."
1,Does not work with HDTVs at all DO NOT BUY this. I Do not know the return policy. This is NOT as it advertises buyer beware!,"I bought this for my VIZIO M220VA 22"" LED/LCD HDTV and it does not work. False advertising. IT is not a Hi-Resolution unless they think 1366x768 is high resolution. I wish I can return after buying a month ago."
5,Works as Advertised,"The cable is of decent build. There isn't exactly much to say about it, except it is necessary to hook any computer up to a monitor or TV.I use mine on a 22 inch Vizio Razor LED, Model M221NV. I get the picture, though it is limited to 1024x768 on my PC. I do not think this has anything to do with the cable, but rather my television.I will say one thing: One side of the cable seems a bit fray, as when it's bent a certain way, the picture on the screen will turn blue/green. This doesn't happen to the other end, and it isn't a big deal. I can simply swap which side goes into my computer, as it is a Male to Male cable.If you think it is ridiculous to pay over $20 for the same cable in a retail store, purchase this. It works as advertised, and will save you money, not to mention it will be delivered in a timely manner."
1,Crap,The old attage you get what you pay for...well here is a prime example. It didn't work and not worth sending back.
1,Fuzzy screen display. Doesn't work at high-res.,"Long cable for under $5, display is fuzzy and creates streaks off of light colors. Also won't display on my 15"" monitor, claiming the resolution is too high. Not recommended."
1,"Doesn't connect well, there's a short or something.","When I first opened this it seemed sturdy, well built and a good length. Plugged it in and it worked... for about 5 seconds. Video kept blinking in and out. I had to play with the cord and position it just right in order to not throw a tantrum. Eventually just ordered a more expensive one. I guess I learned my lesson. You get what you pay for."
3,It works,The device works. I did have to wiggle the connection while just plugged in. Fully screwed in I could not easily get a signal.
5,Great Cord At A Great Price,"I was really please with my purchase, super fast shipping. The cord works very well and is a good deal. I shopped for a cord for quite some time at stores and no one could come close to this price! Definitely buy these types of things at Amazon."
2,Low price = low performance,"When I purchased this cable, it was less than $4. I tried it on my monitor at 1920x1080 and it was not usable for working at a desk, as the picture was poor. I'm using it on a TV now, and that is better since I sit far enough away from the TV so the picture looks decent. The cable might perform better at lower resolutions, but I would recommend paying a little extra to get something better. Good things about the cable are that it is nice and long (as described) and feels sturdy. Overall, for the price, I'm satisfied."
1,one time only,I bought these and it worked only the first time i used it. the next day i was trying to figure out what was wrong. because my computer was regestering the TV but the TV was not regestering the computer. the TV is brand new so i tried a different cable i already had and it worked fine. so it was a defective cable.
3,Bully at Work,All my daughter had to do with this book was place it on her desk at work and the bullying stopped!
5,GO EAGLES!!,"My husband and I own a beautiful little Ori-Pei (shar-pei / pug mix) and a lot of people always say, ""HE is sooo cute!"" She wears a Phillies collar inthe summer so I finally got my husband to agree to the pink Eagles collar. She is 18 pounds and the MEDIUM size fits perfect (on the tightest medium sized setting). She looks so cute! Now when people see HER they gush about how cute our little GIRL is!! ....and she is still displaying her Philly Eagles pride!"
2,"Too small, not easy to clean","I bought my Cadco convection oven seven months ago and the gasket around the door already broke off. The interior is not large enough to fit a regular sized cookie sheet. It's a pain in the neck to clean. You need to scrub really hard with steel wool to get the grease off. It's stainless steel and the company says not to use caustic products, so I stuck with steel wool. The main reason I bought it was because of the high reviews it got on Amazon. If anyone had been truthful and mentioned how long it takes to clean the darn thing, I never would have bought it. Read this review before you pay all that money for it!"
2,Won't Allow You to See the Road,"I bought this light because there are so many positive reviews I found here at Amazon on this product. Most reviews mentioned that this light is very bright, and it allows you see and to be seen. I beg a different opinion. Though I don't necessarily disagree that this light allows you to be seen, it definitely does not allow you to see far and clear enough to drive more than 10 miles/hour on a dark road. Certainly, the light is not as bright as a 1 watt luxeon."
3,Pretty good light,"Nice bright light, works well on dark streets, however, you can't really aim it where you want. You can aim where you want the light in front of you, but there is no aim side to side. Also, I'm not sure why there is a total strobe effect, I can see where a strobe along with a constant light is useful, but not all 4 lights strobing.I haven't had it long enough to give a battery drain yet, but I am hoping that with LED's, the batteries will last a while."
3,It worked okay for about 8 months,"I was perfectly happy with this light for about 8 months, in which time I commuted almost every day via bike and only had to change the batteries once. Now it has suddenly broken on me. When I press the button, the light simply flashes on and off quickly, instead of staying on. This of course makes it impossible to use, so I have had to purchase a new light. I wish there was more I could do but I don't see any way to go about it."
2,If you have money to spend,"Easy to use Linux with tons of tutorials, nice till you discover that you just installed the basics and to get more you need to open your wallet. Better off with a fancy LInux like Suse 9.3 or Mandriva or if money matters something like Ubuntu or Kubuntu or even Federa Core is you are not too much on the Internet. Their click and run technology is a good idea, except that most software they propose can already be downloaded for free from the Internet."
1,Clunky Junky,"I bought this waving iron at Target and returned it right away. It was clunky, awkward to hold.... messy to work with. I recommend the Infiniti Waver by Conair instead! [...]"
2,not what I was expected,I thought it was going to make my hair curly but all it does is look like I crimped my hair.
1,HATE IT!,"I just bought this and I went straight home and tried it and I hate it. I don't know what bed head is even thinking selling this piece of crap. It heated up very quickly but no matter what I did it would not put a good ""wave"" in my hair. I have naturally curly hair that I use a flat iron to straightin and I even had my hair completly straight and this waver did nothing. Please don't bother to purchase this, you will only be disappointed. In the end it just looked like I had braided my hair and let it dry with a little more frizz than I normally would have. Don't waste your money."
2,Mix of Truth & Fiction,"This documentary is blend of truth and fiction. To the makers credit they scored personal interviews with Defeo family neighbors and close friends who give insight into the family and the events leading up to the murders along with rare photographs not seen in almost 40 years.[...]The Defeo murders were best summed up by attorney William Weber. "" This was the murder of a family, that could have been your neighbor or mine "" Granted there were problems in it but all families do. The best book written on the Defeo Murders was done in 1981 called "" High Hopes The Amityville Murders "". I cannot give this documentary more than 2 stars despite it's qualities because too much of the so called facts in it have been debunked by reliable sources and the Brigante and Defeo families long ago."
4,Fine Book,"Other reviewers have stated what this book is about, but I don't think this is quite a 5-star book however. Even though the title is ""brief"", he made no mention of all was the growth of plastic surgery following all the disfigured soldiers returning from WW1. Paul Ehrlich's development Salvarsan didn't even get an entire page devoted to it. Some history on treatments for others diseases are lacking or absent. This book could have been really good if the author threw in a few hundred more pages, (easy for me to say) but it's still a fine reference."
1,Desisdry Expandable Bread Box,"Dang, I had to give it a 1. I couldn't give it a negative 50! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! Spare Yourself!!!! I couldn't rate this negative, so I hope it is registering as ZERO. I would have left this review sooner in hopes of sparing as many people as possible, but I tore 3 ligaments in my hand trying to retrieve my bread from this device. I am very strong and have really long fingers, etc. I can also tell you that this is the worst design - please spare yourself!!!!!!!! The minute I saw it, I suspected (without an engineering degree), that it was a poor design, but I had to try it out! I had to go to my doctor, have xrays, then go to my orthopedic doctor. I am still doing treatments in hope to avoid surgery."
3,very tiny and THIN,"I bought this because I needed a flash drive for school and this looked super portable and holds a lot more than my old one. I haven't had any problems with it on my desktop. I don't know about the speed because I don't transfer huge files, mostly homework assignments and such. My only complaint is that it is SO SO THIN, my laptop (mac) will not read it because it doesn't touch the contacts. If you really want it still and you use a laptop, I solved this the ghetto way and taped some masking tape onto just the back part of the flash drive to make it thicker, and now it reads! Huzzah. I hope it doesn't melt or something. I think it's sloppy on Sony's part to not consider that though, so I knocked it down a few stars. I would suggest this only if you don't use a laptop and you just want something tiny and portable to save small files."
1,Misleading Communist Postmodern Propaganda,"The title, ""Inklings of Democracy in China"" is greatly misleading. The book spends the first chapter exclaiming the ethnocentricity of western democracy, re-defining the very of concept of ""democracy"" itself. Suzanne Ogden plants the seed of a relativistic outlook on what she deems ""democracy"", and uses this new postmodern take on ""democracy"" to justify China's government.To save you a little time from this 400 page read, this is Ogden's argument:a. Democracy can be interpreted to be Chinese Communismb. China's government is nothing but Chinese Communismc. China has a democracyA better (and more honest) title of Ogden's book would have been ""China - How One Should Change the Definition of Democracy to Whatever the Hell They Want"""
4,I can't wait for her next book!,"I quite enjoyed this story. I read it some 10 months ago so can't really give a great review on the ins and outs of the story however, Isolde puts great detail into the historic accuracy and you can tell that there has been a lot of research put into the book. The characters are well written in both the Maiden and the Unicorn and her other book (my favorite) The Knight and the Rose."
3,Nothing special,Other than being set in a fascinating period of time there is nothing particularly special about this book. It's not bad - it's just not particularly good. Sharon Penman has nothing to worry about. I found it to be slow-moving and slightly boring. It was salvaged by good attention to historical detail though. Although the author could have put more detail into the afterward. She completely neglects mention of Richard III's notoriority.
3,IROCK!,Purchased Iroc 3 weeks ago - claims to upgrade to 256K with additional Smart Media cards. Purchased card and loaded system up. Could not get unit to play over 40 songs -even though 86 were loaded (combination of internal and external memory) - wrote tech service - only received statement that eventually unit will be able to play 99 songs - but did not answer my question or problem why I was having trouble.
5,Funny,Cool and funny hat and came as ordered. It was shipped quickly and came within about two days. Great for crazy hat day!
3,wow....,"Tia cheating on Angel? and the thing is, i can't decide who's better for her, Angel or Trent. Trent sounds so nice, and Angel, well, they've been together forever. what i wish was that they would spend more time on Conner and Liz, they were barely in this book! along with jeremy. i would hope that Jessica will get back with Jeremy-Will was totally not worth her time. Evan...er...i'm not too big on him and Jessica with a possibility of getting together. overall, this was a good book, though it is most definitely not one of my favorites. i'm looking forward to As If I Care...it's got Jeremy on the cover! and It's My Life."
5,Bird is amazing!,"Whatta talent! Is there anything this woman cannot do? Actress, writer, singer. What more could you ask of a person?"
4,Spoke too soon.,"Just got the unit yesterday. I'm using it as both stereo and home theater. Comments about the flimsiness of the CD trays are not without substance, but otherwise I'm very pleased. It sounds great, looks nice too. Whole lotta audio for not much money.Update: After one year of light use, the flimsy CD trays got jammed. Now it's in the shop. Remains to be seen what I'll pay for repairs.I'd reduce the number of stars to 1 but that doesn't seem to be possible."
2,"Wasnt great, then it died","This thing was OK. Too many buttons to use easily. It also came with very short cords for the speakers which hapmered how I wanted to set it up. It made alot of noise and fuss before it would give you back your CDs. It claimed to have a connection to computers/mp3, but it was for PC only, not Mac. It was cheap, but not worth it."
4,nice book but,I purchased this prior to the Sears baby book and now looking back a lot of it is duplicate material. That being said I love the Sears' books... just be sure you do what works for you and your family best!
2,Good enough,"I bought this camera for my nieces who are 8 and 10 because they are going on a trip this spring, and I wanted them to be able to take their own photos. This is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, because they are kids and who knows what could happen to the camera. This also allows them to have their own camera and leaves mom's camera alone! I wouldn't recommend this for adults or for people who want a better quality picture and camera, but it's great for the purpose!"
2,Healthy & tasty pasta blob,"This pasta clumps together during cooking and turns into a lump of goo. It has good flavor, although I prefer my fettuccine to spin around my fork."
5,Almost perfect for my needs,"As a typical breakfast-skipper, I found Clif Bars while trying to find something to MAKE me eat breakfast and awaken my metabolism. I love the Peanut Toffee Buzz variety best of the flavors I've tried so far. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids, but these do the trick for me. Granted, these should not be a snack, as they are high calorie. They're a great thing to keep in the car or backpack in case someone is really hungry and doesn't have time for a meal. If they were just slightly less sweet, I'd say they were perfect."
2,In hindsight...,"Well the war is over, in hindsight the book was almost completely wrong. The part about how the war will hurt the Kurds is perhaps the most embarrasing. I feel the book was written for a quick sell, it took advantage of those who were looking for legitimate reasons in opposing the war in Iraq, as now it's clear the book had very little factual basis to stand on.The only reason gave this book two stars instead of one is because the US hasn't yet found any WMD besides the cleaned-up mobile labs. But I feel even in this point the book will be proven wrong, once again."
4,Alphaville's third album a curious blend,"After the overproduced nonsense of ""Afternoons.."", this album was a definite breath of fresh air, if uneven. Its also a hard one to judge, because some of the songs are so good (the title track, ""She fades away"", ""Heaven or Hell""), and some are almost unlistenable (""Ariana"", ""Middle of the Riddle""). The synth arrangements are a bit dull: we're still waiting for the lightness and elegance of ""Forever Young"". Marian's voice sounds a bit deeper here, and he's striving for more vocal range. All taken into account, a pretty good album."
5,good book to give your mother!,"I bought this book for my mother.I read it before I gave it to her,I'm a mother of a 5yr old and 9 month old.This book is for all mother's.What this book taught me was what we inspire in our children today stay's with them for a lifetime.(sometimes forever through their chidren,our grand-children.)"
1,overheating?,"i just got mines and i totally agree that it gets pretty hot. i am worried that it is going to overheat and burn out like other certain laptops. i am going to try to return mine. any comments, please email me at candymcb@hotmail.com"
2,Heed the warnings about noise and heat!,"I've been working with my new Vaio for three weeks now. I was attracted to its sleek design, bright screen and portability. I read the reviews about how noisy it is and how hot the processor gets. I chose to ignore them because I wanted a sleek, cool looking machine. And now I must suffer for my design sensibilities. The fan is frustratingly noisy and it goes off every thirty seconds because of the heat the processor generates. Incidentally, the review about it being able to burn a bare leg is spot on. I haven't done it, but it's that hot!It's a good looking machine but there must be others just as sleek but better designed. Keep looking! I'd return this but I can't deal with the hassle of back-up and restoring."
5,Good Product,"Although these picks are smaller than I anticipated they are still easy to hold and use. For me, they have the perfect blend of flexibility without being too flexible. All in all, an excellent product that I would definitely purchase again when needed."
5,Perfect,"I purchased the .38 size and love them.Having picked up the guitar recently from a twenty year break, I was having some issues with the heaviver picks and my acoustic. The light weight pick and size are perfect, and I barely notice any pick noise coming from them. The only issue I have is the color. With light colored carpet in the house: if I drop it I can barely find it!"
4,Just Great!,"Tina Arena's ""in deep"" album is a sign of an upcoming pop music star. She does better in every album, her sorrowful voice is so touchy; the improvement can be observed since ""Chains"" (her previous album). It is really hard to identify which one is the best among the tracks. Hope she will be very successful in the States, too, as she is in Europe. My favorite songs are: ""i want to live with u"", ""no shame"", ""burn"", ""i want to spend my lifetime loving u""... I should add that the cover ""i want to know what love is "" is great! Also, if you are intrested in French music try to find her latest single ""Aller plus haut"" which was a great hit in Europe! (Yes! she sings in French, too)."
4,A worthy CD,"Tina Arena....who? You may ask. She's one of THE singers in Australia. And it isn't hard to see why. Her debut album was an uneven product with occasional flashes of great potential. She could sing but her material was uneven. But it's on this album where she really shines. She works at her music, co-writing her songs and producing ballads aka Celine Dion. Sometimes it doesn't work because she occasionally oversteps territory and sounds too much like Celine Dion. But when she really follows her own style, she shines on songs such as the gospel sounding ""Sixteen Years"" and the shimmering ""I want to Know What Love is"". There are 1 or 2 throwaway filler but what matters is the quality of the songs and how good it feels to listen to it. And with this CD, you'll be in deep listening to the CD before you know it."
5,Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898,This should be required reading in High School!!! Comparisons with modern-day happenings and all the events in between would serve this Nation well.
5,"Awesome, I am loving it !",This Paper Towel Holder is awesome. It was actually better than what I was expecting to receive. It is really nice & highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is the one !!
5,"READ but don't BUY this book, check it out of a library","Don't give this author a dime. Check this book out of a library and read it. Or wait 6 months and buy it at a used book store or amazon's used vendors or another used online vendor. Why not give this writer a dime?Because this is the story the NYT held FOR ONE YEAR in order to ensure Bush got ""re-elected"" and gave Risen time to put this thing in print. Then, and only then, with their publish date 30 days away, do they bother to inform their readers that, oh yeah, the Preznit has been spying on us for years.WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL US THIS BEFORE THE ELECTION?And, when they finally did run the story, why didn't they tell us exactly why they held it? And how the Preznit begged them to not run it.Now, we also find out that the Preznit began domestic spying BEFORE 911. http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/011306Z.shtml"
3,not bad,"When I saw this book my first thought was 'Not another I ran away to Paris and found myself book,' and probably that will be a lot of people's reactions but give this book a chance. Having read Suzy's born to shop books I already liked her and was curious to see how she'd fare without her beloved and good natured husband.Her Paris is light, funny and a bit mad. The tone of the book is gentle and has can be read by everyone from grandma to highly literate teens. It's a very pleasant way to pass a few hours."
1,Bad Ball Marker,This product is horrible. Instructions were bad and functionality was worse. My father had a better one 35yrs ago!Tried to return and got the run-around. Have since tossed it out and taken the 30 dollar loss.
3,"Good for rock, Bad for pop","My favorite is Boston.""Amanda"" is the greatest ballads of the eighties. Toto is a good group, too."
2,Boring,This book is tedious and too long. The story line is not a complex tale to tell. Why drag it out?
1,The reason why this is under 2 bucks,"This release is by Hollywood - HCD-102. I bought this for the title cut, ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" but I couldn't make it through the entire cut. This version lacks the gritty power and soul of the original recording. There is no warmth here - it sounds like Percy has sung this song way too many times and is singing this time in the lounge of the Holiday Inn. You may like it. The production values are OK. It's just not the original."
2,not as hoped,"found this book to be a big disappointment. By the cover and title I thought it would really give in depth plans for customizing one's home for their felines,but it doesn't. Lots of small pictures and large narrative. Returned my copy even though s/h took large chunk of my return credit. If you, like myself,really want some measurements and design elements to construct thoughtful abodes for your cats look elsewhere ..alehar"
3,A one volume set,"This is a fantastic book. One of my favorite resources for those who wish to better understand the Sermon on the Mount. Content-wise it deserves 5 stars. However, it is misleading to call this a 2 volume set. As far as I can tell, other than the cover image, this is identical to the other single volume paperback binding of Studies in the Sermon on the Mount. I loved the old hard back two volume set, and hoped that I would receive a similar paperback version in two separate volumes. This is not it."
3,Pretty Silly,"Was pretty underwhelmed by this book.Charlotte is an heiress who clearly lives in a world where that is all that matters. She tries to get out of that by becoming engaged to a man who supposedly sees past that--of course that isn't the case. Her fiance turns out to be a scuzz bucket.Damien Wynter (I couldn't get over the cheeze-ball spelling of that) swoops in and saves the day. He proposes since they are both far too wealthy for mere mortals to intermingle with that they get together. Because Charlotte, more than anything wants a baby.They even have a rather goofy (in my mind) dance off scene where Charlotte challenges Damien with her years of ballet moves and he matches her.I just couldn't get inside the minds of these characters, they seemed pretty flat to me.But it was alright for a smidge of escapism."
4,great book for preschoolers,"Book was informative, had step by step ""rules"" for the cubs to follow, and had a story line for the reader. The analogy of the ""apple"" looking fine on the outside but could be a rotten one on the inside,as well as the implications from the newspaper headlines was too advanced and confusing for my 3 year old. These comparisons would work best with 5+ age group. I would recommend this book but for slightly older children."
5,Great stranger danger book for children,The Berenstain Bears did a great job explaining strangers and how to act around all strangers. Very appropriate for young children.
4,It was okay,"This was a okay dvd. She went over the basic guickly. I would not call this and instructonal belly dance. I did like some of the demo and I did like the rountin. I giving it 4 stars for effort. It's was not the greatest dvd I have bought, but it was not a bad one either."
5,Great! Great!,"I absolutely enjoyed having Jilina as my teacher in this dvd. I love that the camera shows her from the front and back in angles, this really helps you see how she's using her body. I love that everytime she teachers a new move in the combinations section she starts from the beginning it really enforces what you've learned so far. Her performance at the end is great as well. I look forward to getting level 2"
1,75% small boxes.,"I bought this book under the impression that I would learn lots of Kanji if I worked through it, but I was very wrong.This book is boring. It lists about 1200 kanji, but all it is a list and some boxes for you to practice writing them in. Sure, it shows you the stroke order and compounds, but everything is written in roma-ji, and the compounds aren't that useful anyway. You aren't going to learn much, even if you do fill up the boxes with Kanji. There are no exercises to increase recognition, and if you have never encountered the words before, simply learning the Kanji will not teach you how to use the word. If you have learned the word before, most likely you learned the Kanji along with the word. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this book. There are much better books for learning Kanji."
3,One step closer from the moon.,"This CD features Christmas songs by '80s heavy metal performers. I'm not really a fan of this type of music, but this isn't half bad. The covers of classic Christmas songs are decent, although not among the best versions of these songs. As for the original songs, they aren't bad. ""Naughty Naughty Xmas"" by Danger Danger is enjoyable in a dopey way. And ""Won't Be Home For Christmas"" by Every Mother's Nightmare shows surprising sensitivity. But ""Happy Family"" by Pretty Boy Floyd is awful. It's a cheap ripoff of the Ramones' ""We're a Happy Family"", rewritten as a Christmas song. But other than that, it's not such a bad album. Fans of heavy metal will probably like it even more than I do."
4,Slinky Long Dredss,"I work at a gown club and purchased this gown about a month a go. It's actually pretty decent, especially for the money. I don't bother lacing it all the way down the thigh. I've actually cut the last two or three sets of loops on both sides. Gives a nice peek a boo effect if your legs and thighs are one of your better assets. It's nice quality and has stuck with me through a few washes. If I needed another decently priced gown in a pinch, I'd choose this one. If you require a floor length gown, you might want to be a little careful. This one stops an inch or two above my ankle and I'm about 5'4."
3,Context?,"Not very useful for anyone looking for Buddhist practice set within an explanatory context. The chapters provide very detailed descriptions of various meditations, but I would have preferred more context. One annoying detail: there are references to terms in the glossary that don't exist in this edition. Recommended for advanced practitions only!"
5,Great story with a lesson included.,I am adding this book to my collection of favorite children's books. I'm storing them up for grandchildren (when they come along). This story teaches a humbling lesson about making judgments without all the facts. It's touching and the illustrations are beauitiful.
5,A Must Have...,Every library must have a copy of this book. It teaches children what is really important in life. People only need people and nothing else.
