2,Not very useful,"Tannen's thesis is interesting, but the whole book is just a collection of examples to back it up. She doesn't offer any ideas or opinions on how to solve the problem. She could save everyone a lot of time by whittling down the length to about twenty pages; one to lay down her point and 19 (instead of 300) to list examples."
2,the book has a unbalanced feeling,"Dr.Tannen spends the bulk of the book supporting a general thesis that the confrontational debate/argument styles of speech and communications is not always appropiate, efficient, or constructive. Her many examples become somewhat tedious as the book reads on. Having read Dr. Tannen's other works and agreeing with Dr. Tannen thesis - I wanted the book to move the process from describing the problem to suggesting solutions and describing how these solutions might work. In the last pages, She does provide some guidelines for useful dialogue. However,I found the solution short. In this respect - I was disappointed because I felt that Dr. Tannon could have written a more constructive treatment of what constitutes useful public dialogue."
4,Great review information,I like the book format. Would love to have a DVD to go with it. Have already used it several times.
5,Illustrator CS WOW Book,Excellent book for beginners to expert. Gives good instruction on basic concepts and expands on the theme with instructions and examples from Artists. The CD contgains excellent material for self study of techniques.
3,Enjoyable but not too informative,"Pleasant book, however not too informative. There are better women's golf books out there, for example ""Golf is a Woman's Game"" is really inspirational. However in all, ""For all who Love the Game"" makes a nice gift or an easy read, but you could do better."
3,Not bad (or good) Hitchcock,"Not one of Hitchcock's best, ""Stage Fright"" is nonetheless an entertaining thriller. Jane Wyman plays a young English girl whose boyfriend (Richard Todd) is accused of murdering his lover's (Marlene Dietrich) husband.The real problem with the movie is Wyman's bland, unconvincing performance. She is plainly not English, although almost everyone around her (even her parents) is. Since she is the main character, this detracts from the film as a whole. Dietrich is superb as the femme fatale and sings ""The Laziest Gal in Town"" and ""La Vie en Rose"". The other performers (Todd, Michael Wilding, and especially Alistair Sim and Sibyl Thorndike) are fine.The script is witty, and Hitchcock's direction is assured. If only he had hired a different lead actress! The film is no ""Rear Window"" or ""Rebecca"", but it is certainly worth a look."
5,Classic Hitchcock,"Stage Fright is defiantly one of my favorite Hitchcock Movies of all time. It has Everything it takes from a great cast to an amazing storyline. It has a suspense theme with a little classical Hitchcock humor thrown into it which keeps you watching until the very end, which has a twist that you would never see coming. I give it 5 stars because Hitchcock couldn't have done it any better then this."
4,"Jane Wyman was an Actress, Capital A","Watching Jane Wyman, who didn't fit the usual Hitchcock profile, work her way through this movie is great. Alongside Marlena Dietrich who had no bad profile and playing it sometimes as low born, it's a performance worth watching. There's a twist in a twist and controversy over Hitch's ideas regarding ""seen through the eyes of..."". Well, you have to see it to understand I won't give the twists and turns of plot away. It's a great little film. Buy it!"
5,Don't let this one get by you! You'll love it!,"Alex ""skinnybones"" is back for more in this hilarious sequel to Skinnybones. Alex has won a contest and is going to star in a TV commercial. The anticipation of this event has Alex filled with ideas for his upcoming fame and celebrity. He fantasizes about signing autographs and his future in show business. However, as Alex finds out, it's not always a done deal! Alex is hilarious in this return of Barbara Park's story about ""dreams"" and reality. She really knows how to pack the laugh- out-loud moments in all her comedic offerings. I have never known a child not to almost ""roll on the floor"" with laughter. If your child reads this book, and you are listening, you will be granted a wonderful memory of your child's delight in books!"
1,NOT satisified,"Doesn't work at all. Finally, once I needed to use it & discovered it was a huge waste of money, it was to late to return."
2,A Terrible Book!,I hated this book for the lack of detail and the lack of a good story on the part of the writer.
4,Excellent book--but premise is flawed.,"The book is extremely well written. However, the whole story is based on Kirk being responsible for a mistake made by the mirror-Spock (leaving the Empire vulnerable before its new policies had allowed it to forge a cooperative federation). The ""mirror"" characters blame Kirk and he accepts it...but it's not logical."
4,Great Book!!!! ...Can't wait for the sequel!,"I must admit, when I saw Return on the shelf of my local Walden Books, I said: ""Of course Shatner wouldn't let Kirk die,"" but man am I glad he (Shatner) didn't. This latest of three in a series leaves you in a suspenseful cliffhanger. If you have not seen the original series, or have no idea about the Mirror Universe, watch the series. I personally love this book. My only question is: "" What is the name of the sequel?"""
5,Star Trek Spectre was a terrific story!,"William Shatner's newest novel chronicles the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk now in the 24th century. Once again the civilization of the galaxy threatens to be destroyed by evil forces. Now Kirk, along with Spock, McCoy, and Scotty, must work together with the crew of the Enterprise E to save their universe. This story was a great pleasure to read, as Shatner was able to relate events that occured in all the Star Trek shows past and present, to write an awesome story. I highly recommend that anyone who is a fan of Captain James T. Kirk to read this book!"
2,Too much continuity,"This is a continuity laden book, where we get at least fifteen episode references per page. Couple this with a wordy writing style, and you have a book that is really difficult to slog through. The further I got, the more I wanted to cringe. James T. Kirk riding to the rescue of the Federation yet again. Enough of the ego trip, Bill! Get over yourself! If you like a Trek-fest of nothing but name-dropping and recaps of your favorite episodes, you'll enjoy this, but I was actually hoping for a story. I am so happy I got this out of the library and didn't actually end up paying for it."
3,Did I read the same book?,"I was aprehensive when I started this book. I was thinking this book would be very suspenseful in the sense that Stephen King would write, based on the cover and description on my copy. Since I don't like those types of books, I anticipated I would get into it and then put it down. I was completely disappointed however to find that I did not think this book was all that suspenseful. I felt it was somewhat predictable. I read another reviewers description to not start this book at night and I wondered if I read the same book they had, because I did not find this story all that scary at all. I don't think I would even classify it as suspenseful. I did finish the book, and it is not the worst book I have ever read, but I don't agree that it is a page turner that all others seem to think."
1,"Luke, baby -- is that you?","What a disappointment! This sequel comes about a quarter century after the original, but shows nothing of its antecedents. You'll search in vain for ""Luke Rhinehart"" here and, like me, suspect a different (and very indifferent) author. My advice is -- don't read it."
5,Great! - 5 stars,"Great great great! A truely worthy successor to the 60'ies cult classic: ""The Dice Man"". Luke uses lots of sarcasm and irony as he places himself in the shoes of his son Larry. He is not being self-righteus and he presents the way of the dice using a great deal of self-irony and he does an extraordinary job displaying his own insignificance. The multiple layers of the book are perfect in context making ideal for close-up reading.I'm Danish - so forgive typing errors. This review reffers to the Danish version of the book."
4,The day you love me,"This movie presents the last years of the super kwon, Tango singer, Carlos Gardel under the title of one of his tangos ""El dia que me quieras."" This is a wonderful but at the same time a very sad love story. You must see this endless love who prevails in the minds and hearts of those in love until death pull them apart."
1,Made by forced labor,"This is the first and probably only Amazon review I will ever write. There is reason to believe these slippers are made in China by political prisoners forced to work. Not just low-paid poor workers. Slave labor courtesy of the communist government.Dr. Charles Lee is an American citizen and practitioner of Falun Gong. He was imprisoned from 2003-2006 when he went to China to assist fellow members of his faith. In a recent interview, he recalls some of the things he was forced to make in prison factories. Christmas lights are one thing. Another he specifically mentions are Homer Simpson slippers where you put your foot in Homer's mouth.I own these slippers, and having learned about their source, I am not proud of it."
1,Not a fan...,I want to feel like I am in a class with the instructor. I do not like the voice over. Feels cold and uninspiring.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I'm not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. I am going to try to do it again and see if I get the same feeling. It seems to go really slow, slower than I expected."
5,Love The Collection,"This has been a great purchase for me and it makes yoga very accessible and easy to learn. Very clear and easy to follow, plus alot of variety with things that you can grow into later on."
4,Yoga for the inflexible,Very good three pack set. It's nice to alternate the practice sessions. Watch them all before you start. Don't think your in shape if you haven't done this for a while. GIve yourself a day between practice sessions in the beginning but don't give up
4,Great Yoga DVD For Beginners!,I really got a lot out of this 3 DVD set. The progression of the routines was easy to follow and helped me begin to become more flexible and relaxed.
2,Not enough cheek.,"What you see on the cover of this magazine is what you get. I bought this magazine because of what the cover said ""cheeky pictorial"". I've seen more cheek in her photos on magazines such as FHM, the magazine that made her famous. You don't get to see any full moon pics on this mag. The only cheek pics you get are the one where Vida is standing in about the same position she is in on the cover and two laying on her stomache and if you look close she is wearing a thong on those pics. I ain't saying that you shouldn't buy this, I just call it the way I see it. I bet that other guy who wrote that other review drooled all over his computer the whole time."
2,A Big Disappointment. Get the book instead,"I absolutely LOVED the book version of Q-Squared. Peter David did a 5 star job with it. After reading the book, however, the audio cassette was a big disappointment. Only the barest threads of the story are included, and many of the funniest moments are left out altogether to fit the story on one tape (for instance, Wesley's ""gift"" is hardly even mentioned). That said, the performances by John DeLancie and Majel Barrett were very well done, earning back a star on my rating. I really recommend getting the book instead. You just miss too much here."
3,"Average Trek, Below Average Peter David","I'd been trying to find this book for years. Given my experiences reader Mr. David's Trek novels, I figured this would be another exciting, entertaining, and witty voyage of the Enterprise-D. But to my surprise, it was rather bland.Some things PAD gets right, like Lxwanna and Q. Other things, he seems to be doing wrong - he doesn't seem to be giving Capt. Picard appropriate dialogue at all, and there's far too much talk and far too little action. Given what he does with Q in the superior Q-Squared, this book is bland and pointless.At the same time, this is better than a good deal of the Trek books out there and a pretty good Q story. But Trekkies and PADians shouldn't expect very mcuh from this."
4,Hilarious! Fun to read,"It's been a while since I read this book, but I think I need to go buy it again(lost last copy) since it was such a fun book to read. It's not heavy on an intricate plot(heavy, intricate plots can get old if that's all you have anyway) but it doesn't come across as flat or predictable either. If you're in need of some humor and fun, with just the right ammount of seriousness thrown in, read this book!"
5,It is excelent book!!,"I am very happy because I have one.It is very interesting book.Many impressive ,color photographs and very important advices about metering and exposes.I recomend this book every serious photographer."
5,"Well,finally Arista...","Being the HUGEST fan of Phyllis Hyman for many,many years...I am quite surprised that they are giving us anything on this lady.I have virtually ""screamed"" thru the internet pleading for re-releases on CD what I possess in album.But they have yet to respond...like they are DISMISSING her or something.They could not imagine the lucrative market that this lady will always maintain.(The very same w/earlier Peabo Bryson & Capitol records....just can't seem to get a direct answer from these people)."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"This has to be one of the most, no check that 'the most' confusing, entertaining, exciting, interesting and best Star Trek book I have ever read.It's one of my most well thumbed Star Trek books and if you buy it it'll be your most thumbed Star Trek book as well."
1,Trek this is NOT,"Peter A David must be the most overrated ST:TNG novelist writing today. If you didn't know he made his living penning comic books, you could probably tell from his dialogue in this book: OTT, garish and full of EMPHASIS! in all the wrong places. Worse, he seems prepared to jettison characterisation, believability, and Trek history just to indulge in some smartarse humour. Halfway through reading this infuriating novel I wanted to seek out the author and tell him to STOP SMIRKING. I really can't imagine any true Trek fan reading this book without a growing sense of horror and disgust. Best to imagine it -- and David's own New Frontier series, which resembles nothing so much as McHale's Navy In Space -- never happened."
3,A good recording - performance needs more intensity.,"A good recording. If someone is an Ornette-influenced saxophonist it's inevitable that they will record in the classic Ornette configuration of sax, trumpet, bass, and drum at some point. That's the lineup on this recording. The song ""Homage"" is a delicate ballad similar in nature to Ornette Coleman's ""Just For You""; a very beautiful melody with sparse accompaniment. The rest of the tracks are more upbeat but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much 'fire' in the performances; the feeling is more like a chamber quartet than a jazz quartet. An exception is Herb Robertson's solo in ""The Tin Ear"" where he blisters the ear with a brass solo. The playing is excellent but very mannered; not as aggressive as the Bloodcount or Caos Totale material."
5,Excellent,Combination of middle eastern instruments and Jazz.. Lots of people tried to do it but was never that good. Should listen to how he made Caravan too.
3,Enterprise's Crew on their first mission: predates TV show,"Admiral Noguchi promotes Kirk to Captain, making him the youngest ever captain in Starfleet; and, follows with an order to take the Enterprise on a mission to support morale in a distant territory of space that is claimed by Klingon and Federation governments at the same time. Easy to read, fun to imagine, and sets a great background for the TV series whose characters it includes. I rated this ""6"" because, as with most ST novels, it does indeed deal with important issues; but a higher rating would require dealing with issues that more strike to the heart. (Best Destiny, by Diane Carey is a Star Trek novel that offers a great example)"
4,Oldie but goodie,"Interesting book on beginnings of our favourite Trekkers: usual stuff, first contact, Spock uses mind-meld, goes crazy, Kirk saves Spock, overcomes the Klingons, new friendship & ties formed. Classic era of cardboard sets.Inside cover: From the moment James T. Kirk steps aboard the Enterprise - the youngest captain in Starfleet history - things begin to go wrong. His Vulcan science officer, Mr Spock, considers Kirk imperetious; the ship chief engineer thinks him an inexprienced young hotshot; his chief medical officer hasn't bothered to show up yet; and the new helmsman would rather be somewhere else. To cap it all, Starfleet has assigned the Enterprise a disappointing tame task; to ferry a troupe of vaudeville performers on a morale-raising mission to Federation bases - in short, a USO tour."
2,Narcissistic science,"Pert interweaves the story of her life, the story of the progression of her feelings at a lecture she gave, and the story of how she isolated brain receptors. I enjoy human-interest science history when the human-interest provides a context for the science being done. Pert tilts the balance so far toward the human-interest component that the science becomes merely an excuse for exploring her psyche. A good book to get from the library; skim the Pert story to get to the science."
1,Too technical,I stopped reading after the first chapter because it was so filled with scientific terms even though this author is highly regarded. It just isn't for anyone who is not scientifically oriented.
1,Hokey and self-centered.,"I don't see what any of the other reviewers see in this book. The whole story is ""Me, me, me, me, me..."""
2,Nothing new here,"Stated simply, this book does no more than apply the following two propositions to a set of facts: (1) people don't tell the whole truth, and; (2) the media's coverage of an event dictates public perception of it. But it does serve the traditional function of providing self-styled cutting-edge pundits the opportunity to vent their abiding cynicism into the national yawn."
4,Good ... But Non-Critical,"Conservatives hoping that ""Spin Cycle"" will serve as an indictment of the Clinton Administration will be disappointed. Kurtz tells the story of media coverage of the Clinton Administration in a non-critical manner, indicting neither the press nor McCurry, Lanny Davis or the other White House spinmeisters. And Kurtz seems to place both Bill and Hillary above the fray and basically non-connected with the daily push and pull of media coverage, making the first couple look like victims. Unfortunately, the paperback edition ends in late July 1998 before the issuance of the Starr Report which proved many of the media leaks of the subsequent seven months to be accurate. Overall, while not a classic, Kurtz wrote an interesting book which ultimately will provide a good timeline of many of the critical events of scandal of the Clinton second term."
2,Problems with sensationalism,"My main concern with this book is how it uses allegations and stories which emerged in the press and later proved untrue. Particularly with regards to the Lewinsky case, a lot of the remarks and speculations which Kurtz uses to draw a picture of how the story unfolded, have proved to be exactly that: speculations. I find it unsettling that someone apparantly so serious as Kurtz has not done some proper sourcechecking. Furthermore, I found the structure of the book to be very chaotic. Also, when I read a book about the development of spin, I don't want a book that reads ""like a thriller"", if I did, I would buy a thriller. For people with interest in the subject of the relationship between the press and the presidency, I strongly recommend Warp Speed by Tom Rosenstiel and Bill Kovach. It will give a nice counterweight to Spin Cycle, and furthermore put some of Kurtz's ideas into perspective."
3,Thought they were good!,"Well, initially I wasn't too familiar with the thompson twins music! I never realized that they were the group that sang Hold Me Now. I always thought it was Gensis or Duran Duran. Anyways, I found most of there singles to be the perfect 80's pop sound. Which is something that I love. They def. reminded me of The Cars! I really love that great 80's synth pop/rock sound. I thought some of the stand out tracks were. Were Bouncing,King for A day, and Perfect Day. I really think that the Thompson twins are really underrated as far as 80's music goes. This is def. a great pop group to check out."
3,"Eh, Just okay","Well i bought this book for about $4 on Amazon USED. I was really hoping it would be a good book but it ended up being just okay for me. It might be helpful for those who don't know anything about recording. Its called ""Modern Recording Techniques"" so i was hoping it might show some cool tips and tricks. NOPE. If your looking for something like that move on to another book. Its not bad for beginners. Its actually very good. I was to advanced for this book."
2,Maybe if you're just starting out...,"This book is way to ""shallow""... It skips from one subject to the next without any detailed insight. Way to much blah, and valuable info very limited. Too much ""outdated"" stuff, very limited modern info!Maybe an OK source when you're starting out."
1,How stupid is this!!,"How can I review this book when I never received it. The seller took my order and when I followed up 2 weeks later to ask about the shipping date, admitted that they didn't have it in stock. A total waste of my time! Amazon should do a better job of monitoring these third party vendors."
4,A thorough commentary - Well worth sticking at.,"I am very glad I read this book. While I found it hard to get into, once I was past the first few sections I couldn't put it down. His strongest section is where he explores the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. David Garland challenges any romanticised pre-conceptions that the reader may have about the crucifixion and explores without apology the uncomfortable things about this gospel: the total failure of the disciples, that Jesus' last recorded words are ""My God my God why have you forsaken me?"" and the lack of appearance of the risen Christ (he stops at 16:8). I gained insight on a new angle on the death of Christ. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Mark or Jesus mission."
3,feh,"When I saw the last episode, I was like, ""What? That's it???"" I started getting depressed. That was such a let down. So, I've been spending nine years watching Ranma all for this? I honestly was outraged. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Ranma, but they can't do this to us! That was mean! I just hope the manga turns out differently, at least has an ending. Feh!"
5,Just in time for holiday gift giving!,"Brief warning: This is not appropriate to purchase for middle school libraries, and you should perhaps think a moment before presenting a copy to your mother and father (who, after all, thought that painting your bedroom bright salmon looked groovy with the avocado green carpeting), but it's a safe bet to buy a copy of Desecrations AND a copy of The Gallery of Regrettable foods to give to everyone else on your gift list.Why? Of course, the interiors were ugly and are now laughable, but it is Lileks' twist on them that makes them hysterical. He is a deft word smith with an off-kilter take on the world around him."
1,"Stupid concept, worthless book","It's easy to look back on previous styles and fashions and laugh at them, but future generations will look at our present trends and laugh, too. In fact, lots of current styles and fashions look bad right here, right now. We don't have to wait to make fun of them."
3,Further to last review.....,"Its a printing error. For anyone who has the same problem, go to the following URL:http://www.phptr.com/title/0131400002It will tell you what you need to do to resolve the problem.I recommend that, if you see the book in a book store, check it carefully before purchasing."
3,Just so-so for me,"Although I have enjoyed several of Alison Lurie's books - I think this one is showing it's age. Written in 1967 it seems a little dated, even regarding the naivete of the ""subjects"". I think it would be interesting to see this book about cults updated in the time of the internet. However,it did make me think about sociology and its uses and abuses. The characters seemed cardboard to me and not drawn strongly enough: more like sterotypes rather and real people. And if you are writing a book about real people - this is a problem"
5,Superb collection,What can be said about Ella Fitzgerald that has not already been said by the countless thousands of her fans? 'Nuff to say that this superb collection sounds as fresh today as it did when recorded over fifty years ago. Every song is beautiful and every song is beautifully sung by the peerless Ms. Fitzgerald. 10 stars!!
2,Seriously flawed.,"Which is a shame, because the basic idea had potential: Star Trek meets Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"". And the writing wasn't completely hopeless; as the story progressed, I did find myself caring what happened next, and moved by the fate of the characters. But there were too many flaws for a high rating; the entire subplot of Deanna Troi's visions/hallucinations was superfluous and pointless, and the concept that the planetary culture that the Enterprise was in conflict with could have provided as much of a challenge as they did required too much supension of disbelief for my taste.Not the worst Star Trek book I've ever read by a long shot, but definitely on the weak end of the scale."
5,A brilliant anti-censorship tale in ST:TNG style.,Some of the best Star Trek episodes were usually 20th century social commentary thinly disguised as 23rd/24th century science fiction. Gulliver's Fugitives continues that same ST storytelling as social commentary tradition.
5,Lots of details the TV pilot didn't have,"After watching the pilot on televison, I saw this book a the grocery store. I wasn't a big trek fan, but Kate Mulgrew's ""Girl Power"" attitude hooked me to Voyager.I read this book in a few days. There were a lot of details that I'd missed the first time I saw the show and lots of details that weren't even in the pilot.I liked how it described in more detail how the crews attempt to mesh so they can use their combined resources to get home.The 8 page photo insert would have been a lot better if it was in color, but it was a neat feature anyway."
5,A Must Have for ACT Prep!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone preparing for the ACT! The practice tests are spot on! Thanks to this book, along with others from Mcgraw-Hill, my son will be able to get into the college of his choice! Mcgraw-Hill's ACT prep books are by far the best on the market!"
5,Spirit Filled,Send Out Your Spirit is an Informative Guide and helpsthe Leaders of Confirmation classes develop new ways ofbringing Confirmation formation alive for the participantson their journey of faith. Great advice and clear exercisesto youth. I recently shared this with the Youth minister atour church. Good read and excellent information.
4,Collector's item of Alan & Eric Project,"When Eric Woolfson died, The Alan Parsons Project ended. We would have liked to see them live, but this was not possible. The band vocalists used by the Alan Parsons Live does not reflect the simplicity and warmth of Eric. In this CD you can remember the best time of APP. It is a collector's item of Alan & Eric Project."
4,Daily Goddess Time,"I expected a little more depth when I got this book; however, I am impressed with the magnitude of information covered here. There are Goddesses well-known and Goddesses lesser known; holidays well-known, and very interesting holidays with their customs from around the world that I've never heard of. I enjoy having a page a day to read from this book, and find it to be more of a world culture book with a Goddess slant, than a Goddess devotional type book."
1,Bad Information,"When she writes that a Scandinavian God (""Dag"" on May 14th) is a Goddess...and when she writes that a poem (the Voluspa, on July 29th) is also a Goddess, then she's totally barking up the wrong tree. She is writing LIES LIES LIES into her book, about people's long held religious traditions. No respect for the Northern European tradition found here. None at all. And if she's gotten this much wrong, what else has she messed up in her book??"
4,Energetic Spirit Filled,No Boundaries is by far one of the most uplifting / energetic / spirit filled gospel experiences of lately. The artists appear to put a lot of genuine praise and worship into this work.
1,Misguided Right wing panderer,"Ms Bruce attempt to teach us whats right and wrong by holding the left responsible for all the Ills in our society falls way short. Her spin is really fascicm rolled up in the guise of being a morally superior culture, this book is as unreadable as her unlistenable talk show. Finger pointing never gets results, especially when the finger pointers have a history of being the proprieters of slavery, genocide and child and immigrant labor exploiters"
2,Doesn't cut it...,My least favorite of all the Hall & Oates CDs. I actually have the two on one CD of Ooh Yeah! and Change Of Season. It really pained me to listen to the whole thing. Run of the mill music. My favorite is still Whole Oates.
3,This Would Not Stir A True Believer,"I am an agnostic who received this book as a gift. I was very enthusiatic about the book, but it has been a bit disappointing. I disagree with the other reviewers, in that I don't think it's an easy read for the lay person. The author does not lay down sufficient groundwork before delving into his theses about the identities of the authors of the gospels. He assumes that the reader knows what Source Q and Septuagint Isaiah are, for instance. The book brings up some thought-provoking points but is generally disorganized and rambling. The result is a watered-down text that is not forceful enough to stir the intellect of a true believer. It preaches to the choir of skeptics. Because I am already cynical about the Bible and religious texts in general, I waded through it, but I would not recommend it."
4,Ballplayers score with younger readers,"""Sharp dialogue, good pace and story-tellingpower... noted Kathy Miller, English teacher. Maureen Holohan'sBroadway Ballplayers series has recieved praise from teachers and colmnists alike. Her books, including Friday Nights by Molly and Everybody's Favorite by Penny, are geared toward middle school girls and boys who show interests in sports of any kind. In Holohan's first Broadway Ballplayers book, Friday Nights by Molly, she shows the struggle of trying to be the best on the basketball court through the eyes of a mediocre player who wants to play as well as her best friend. The Ballplayers have to try to overcome teams with more experience and more height. Her series portrays the problems middle school students might have with sports, such as not giving up against teams with a better record, learning teamwork instead of arguing or desiring to be as good a player as someone else. Middle school students would be drawn in by this series. END"
3,Controversial Theory Takes a Novel Approach to Physics,The mathematics and arguments in this book will be difficultfor many to follow. Scientists have called this theory into questionfrom its inception on mathematical as well as experimental grounds.
5,water crock,This was purchased to replace a crock who seals wore out. It works fine. Heavy ceramic that fits on our stand. Keeps water cool and fresh. Easy to dispense.
5,Comes up with the goods,"once again. Boney James rules. Forget about classifying the music he plays. He does what he does, and he does it well. I read a few reviews, which I only use as guides, as well you should, and then I went ahead and parted with my hard earned cash. If you like his type of groove, then you know this type of groove, and make no mistake about it-IT'S A GROOVE. Highlights are many. Sure the purist of you out there will cry out for less vocals, and I understand where you're coming from. I was a bit concerned too, until I bought the disc and listened to it. Highly enjoyable."
4,Good but not Boney James great,I have been looking forward to this CD release for awhile now because I am a huge Boney fan. Its certainly not as good as Seduction or Sweet Thing but is a nice CD. My only issue is that Boney is starting to introduce alot of vocals to his music and I would rather hear is sweet sax. In the future I hope I hope he limits to the vocals to three or fewer tracks. Overall a good effort but I was expecting much more. What can I say he has spoiled me.
1,Boney Shine,"The CD is the worst one that Boney has ever recored. Moreover, I have all Boney's CD and this one is horrible when compared to the others. The vocalist take away from his sax and all the other instrumentalist that he is so well known for. Boney please don't use as many vocalist in your next CD one or two are okay. Some of the RB singers should just stick to RB recordings not smooth jazz. I really do enjoy your music."
3,"Looks nice, band is low quality","Watch looks nice. The band has a pretty ugly, fake-looking red coloring. The inner part of the band also cracked easily after taking the watch on an off a few times."
4,"Entertaining, but sort of Nancy Drewish","On top of being entertaining, this book was geographically informative (places of interest in Virginia), which puts it above most other novels. The tone, however, was a bit more adolescent, and even goody-goody, than I would have liked. Maybe that is just the way Gardner is. It beats gratuitous bad taste, but it seemed a bit out of place, considering the subject matter--serial killer, FBI, etc. All in all, I'll pick her up again, but I might put her down if the tone bugs me."
4,Not the best but good enough,I THINK THIS WAS AN OK BOOK . I GAVE IT A FOUR BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO READ THROUGH THE WHOLE THING WITH INTEREST . THERE WERE SOME DESCRIPTION PAGES THAT I JUST PASSED OVER JUST TO GET TO THE GOOD STUFF. SOMETIMES WRITERS SPEND TO MUCH TIME ON DECRIBING NOTHING THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT .. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE PARTS THAT WERE GOOD WERE VERY GOOD .
5,Excellent Read,"I'm not going to go into the plot of the book because it's been done in the other reviews, so I will just say that this is a great read....I couldn't put it down and it was done in a day or so....If you haven't already read Gardners other books ""The Other Daughter"", ""The Perfect Husband"", ""The Third Victim"", and ""The Next Accident"", I highly reccommend doing so, as some of them will give you a better insight into the histories of the main characters in the book : Pierce Quincy, Kimberly Quincy, and Lorraine O'Conner (Rainie)....and knowing their histories makes the book even more enthralling. Pick it up, Read it and Enjoy it!"
2,In the good/bad news department--aargh!,"Although I normally enjoy Lisa Gardner's books, her continued use of the phrases ""in the good news department"" and ""in the bad news department"" is incredibly frustrating. So far, nearly every Gardner book I've read contains these words over and over again. The Killing Hour, for example, contains the phrase(s) 11 times (I searched on my Kindle) and Gone repeats the phrase(s) 17 times. In fact, the words are used with such frequency as to almost spoil my reading experience. I will be knee-deep in the swamps with Kimberly and Mac, only to be yanked back to the here and now by those five words. The moment is lost. Gardner (or her editor) should catch these mistakes and suggest alternatives. I don't think I'll be reading any more of Gardner's books. They're just too frustrating."
4,"Location, a good read","A good fast read. Lisa needs do a little more research about locations. Lee County is an 8hr drive from the Dismal Swamp. Wytheville is 3 hours from Lee County. Coal mining is a high paying job. It brings a high standard of living to this corner of Virginia.We people who live in SWVA, hate to be trashed by those who are uneducated/ ignorant about this part of our nation."
5,An Anthology of Strategy & Strategic Thinking,"A monumental reference book! The title of the book in French (I have it both in French and English) would roughly translate into Anthology of Strategy in World History. It puts the accent on the concept of Strategy rather than War. And that's how I use it. I would even call it the History of Strategic Thinking. I am a management and technology expert and this book is one of my reference books on Strategy and on my shelf it sits alongside books on Strategy.What I like most about it, is its historic depth and scope. There is, to my knowledge, no other work on Strategy which has such a historic scope ranging from Ancient history to modern days with so much information and intelligence.I strongly recommend it to all those interested in the History of Strategic Thinking.I am a regular reader of Mr Chaliand and when I read his books I have the same experience as when I read Nietzsche: a feeling of freshness."
2,More of a Art Lesson than a good thriller....,"A very slow moving book. I expected the book to be a good one, alas I was let down. If you read the first two, dont bother. I felt I was reading up on Art and their poncy art galleries than a good crime book. I didnt 'connect' with the characters like say P. Cornwells Kay Scarpetta. Come on Linda pick up the pace a bit and return to the detail and wit of the first two novels. Read if you must, but dont expect much........."
1,Cold Hit,Stick with Phillip Margolin and John Grisham. Very boring. You will get tired of reading about what liquor the main character drinks and how cultured she is....too boring to finish.
2,Kindle edition rife with typos!,"I purchased the Kindle edition of this book, and returned it almost immediately. It is so ridden with typos that I found it too annoying to read. This may be a fine book, but do not purchase the Kindle edition!"
4,Sing Down the Moon,"Bright Morning and her friend Running Bird, members of a Navaho tribe, are out tending sheep when they are taken by Spanish slave traders. With the help of another Indian slave, the girls are able to escape and journey back home. American militia, the ""Long Knives"" force the Navaho out of their home and to a forced march. Overall, I thought the book was engaging, fast-paced and an interesting story about a shameful time in American history."
3,Misspelling,The story is a good one but I just could not understand why he spelt Navajo with an H instead of a J
5,Book Review Of The Book Sing Down the Moon-Patrick,"Bright Morning is a 14-year-old girl. It all started when she was grazing her sheep with her friend Running Bird. All of a sudden Bright Morning's dog started to bark, and birds started to chatter. Then Running Bird turned around and saw Spanish settlers. They started coming toward them. They asked them where Corn Mountain was. Bright Morning pointed out the direction to the mountain. The settlers came closer, and closer. Then in an instant they were beaten up and tied together. Where will they go and how will they get back to the Mesa where they live? Read the book Sing Down the Moon to find out what happens."
4,Tina's Reveiw...enjoy!************~~~~,I didn't like this book because the characters name were funny. But other than that it was great.This book was about a war between the Navahos and the Long Kinves. The Navahos win!!!I think a reader who is open minded would like this book because it is so different>>
1,"No creativity, lots of pre-productions tools used to create all the smash-ups","Basically this concept is composed by a bunch of music, arranged, smashed, and played in different sequences. No creativity involved at all on this disc, the guy that orchestrates this effort is part its record company, so its has the ability to get a lot of music from different resources and mix it in different songs. Lyrics are terrible and they talk by themselves: no creativity, this is an effort to sell music. It's name ""Piñata"" says everything about its music: emptiness, well decorated product/music and more important, something that deserves to be broken."
3,funny to little children. Breastfeeding is not showed.,"The book is really funny, specially for little children. I think that bottlefeeding is showed as the only possibility. Breastfeeding is important and the book has no place to mention it, because mother is not there to feed her baby."
5,Great advice!,This book gives sound advice that I use in my everyday life and in planning for a future rich in not only money but health and happiness. Good buy!
2,Average Groomsmen Junk,"The deceptive picture of these gifts makes it seem the two items come in a wooden box. This couldn't be farther from the truth! The case is about the cheapest thing imagineable, while the flask and cigar case are close behind. The flask is flimsy and the cigar case is very average. This is not a gift you would give to any groomsman you are fond of.I gave it two stars because this is the same ... you find in the Tux stores, but less expensive!"
4,gift for pre-k child,I am impressed by the number of different activities and the clarity of instruction for both child and for the parents.
2,Not So Good,I think this would have been better as a novella then I could deal with the lack of character and plot development.
1,Waste Of Money,"It didn't work for me, I used all the container in 4 weeks and have more bedbugs now than I did before!"
2,Starts out good but fizzles...,"I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole ""adversarial"" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard."
2,Umm huh?,"I'm a bit disappointed in this book. I usually buy the Exam Prep books because I findthey put out excellent study material but this book is an exception. I was very disappointedwith the chapter questions, I don't recall any Server+ questions that were ""Fill in the Blank"" style questions, and I did not see any questions that were scenario based as per the real exam.That the heck is with these fill in the blank questions?? I could not find any of the objectives listed in any of the chapters. So I had no idea what Exam area I was focusing on.I had to download the Server+ Objective PDF file and print it off so I could figure out where I was in this book. Then I came to the end of Chapter 7 and was taken on a nice tour on how to Install RED HAT LINUX????.......WHAT IS WITH THAT???????I did not see and objective of how to Install Red Hat Linux in my objective list.Like what going on Exam Prep???"
2,not good,I used this product but could see not difference in my teeth shade. Maybe good for someone but not for me.
2,Poor safety,"Product looks and feels good. Safety lever does not engage as it should, You should never carry a live blank chambered in this gun while it is in the holster. Only when shooting rack the blank into the chamber.For the money is adequate."
2,Good quality but expensive for what you get.,"I purchased this item when looking for a source for good quality colored wool. I love the wool but was disappointed when I found the exact same thing at Michaels for about $4.50 (regular price). If you don't have a source near you, this would be a good option but if you have a craft store that actually carries wool felting supplies, I'd check there first."
3,One?,"I ordered one ounce from other vendors, and this one is half of the size I got from others. Is it really one ounce?"
4,best school memory book I've found,"I have bought many variations of books to keep pictures and documents from each school year. Some are too small, some have no pockets or too few pages, and some are hard bound and get too fat when you paste in pictures, causing the binding to fail. This book is the best. The spiral binding expands to prevent overfilling. The pages are large, colorful and durable. Pockets are large enough to handle report cards, some artwork, awards, etc for EACH YEAR. There's plenty of space for pasting in favorite pictures or mememtos. I bought a second book and relabeled the pages for 8th thru 12 grade because I couldn't find any other good scrapbook for junior/senior high. The section labels are a little young for the older grades but I can modify them."
2,Very small figurine,"Figurine is very small with very small pieces, intended for older children. Can find something cheaper in local area probably."
4,Head over Heels,"The DVD worked perfectly! Although watching it at 20 was a little different than watching in junior high, it was still hilarious in spots, but cheesy in others. Any Freddie Prinze Jr fan would eat this up. Not a movie I would watch frequently, but one I would certainly watch again."
2,A Movie to Watch If You Are Bored,"While this movie had its funny moments, for the most part I found it too typical to stand out. Freddie Prinze, Jr. looks too young to play his part, and Monica Potter looks too old next to Prinze. I felt that the main characters were miscast in this movie. If not for the old ladies who work with Potter's character, Amanda, the movie would have been a complete flop.If you are looking for a romantic comedy, go rent ""Someone Like You"" or any Meg Ryan, Julia Roberts flick. Don't waste your time here."
1,The quality was so bad I could barely see it! Don't get this.,It was hard to view because it was such poor quality. I couldn't see most scenes that were filmed as night time. It was very old and very difficult to watch. I really had to make myself 'hang in there' to finish watching. It's a donate to the library DVD now. Not worth watching and certainly not worth buying.
5,Dee Daniels has an incredible voice.,"This album is so special. It offers an opportunity to hear one of the premier jazz singers, Dee Daniels. And she is backed by the beautiful Metropole Orchestra. It is surprising to me that more people don't know who Dee Daniels is. Once you hear her you will never forget her voice."
1,very disappointing.,"I'm a big fan of young adult fiction, but this book was a total disappointment. It was written from a 15-year-old's perspective, but felt unreal (and I remember being a 15 year old girl pretty well). Her world seems to consist solely of one-dimensional, good/bad parents, step-parents, and neighbors. Her character contradicts herself and is pretty unlikeable. I just really couldn't really get behind the plot, which is full of improbable dramas. The issues of race and sex feel forced, (again) unrealistic, and simplistic.The book just wasn't written well and wasn't even mildly entertaining. Also, there's some silly graphic designing with upside-down text (don't turn the book around, it's just repetition) and a really, really, really bad choice of font."
1,Wrong Book Received and no way to fix other than order another book.,"I ordered the above book, Fundamentals of Clinical Supervision 4th Edition and need it by September 15th but was dismayed to open the package marked correctly on the outside but inside found Sports Economics. Yes, anyone can make a mistake but I cannot find anywhere on the amazon.com website to complain or return the used book and re-order the correct book. No ""customer service"" icon. Nothing. No phone number to call. I did not pay $75 for a book only to have to buy another one and no way to return or no instructions on what do to. Is there anyone out there who can tell me what to do?"
5,THE supervision text,"It is easy to see why Fundamentals of Clinical Supervision is so frequently referred to as THE supervision text. Bernard and Goodyear successfully synthesize a vast (and growing) amount of multidisciplinary supervision literature into a single comprehensive source. The book is well written, and organized such that it makes for easy referencing. Each of the 12 chapters presents an in-depth examination of both seminal and contemporary writing related to clinical supervision. While the `Supervisor's toolbox' serves as a welcome resource for graduate students and new supervisors, the thorough presentation of the most up-to-date theoretical and empirical work informs seasoned supervisors and educators alike."
4,"Good ,for a DS 9 book. Anyone heard of the High Crusade?","I don't read star trek books anymore, but I remember liking this one. My only probably is some of its basic ideas are from ""The High Crusade"" a science fiction novel by Poul Anderson. Don't take my word for it order that book from your library. The time travel & everybody dying parts were surprising & not in ""The High Crusade"" however. Enjoy."
4,A high body count.,"When Quark inadvertantly activates an alien signal device, invaders infiltrate DS9 and slaughter ensues. Although badly written, this book features a tight, creative plot that would have made a fine episode (albeit a very bloody one). I expect sloppy prose in a Trek novel, but it's important for the author to get the dialogue right, and Dafydd ab Hugh succeeds for the most part. The central characters are Quark and Odo; their interaction is handled well. At this point in the series, Odo's nature and backstory had not been developed very well, so ab Hugh has him doing some things that don't quite jibe with the way he would be developed later, but that's forgivable. In particular, the climax requires him to withstand some impossibly harsh environmental conditions. All in all, though, it's a good read if you like Trek."
4,"So you want to speak Klingon, tlhingan Hol dajatlh a'","The how to in basic klingon speach, learn some expression and the basic klingon philosophie, you will go through many different aspect of the speach: how to be polite -> get to the point... no small talk, curse warfare, toasting, replacement proverbs, secrecy proverbs, holiday proverbs... and so on !! just bare in mind to keep a towel near by.."
3,Not Written for all Audiences,"""Is it possible to summarize a theory of consciousness in a short compass? I think it unlikely unless if the summary is addressed to those who have already taken the long excursion with that audience in mind I shall try."" (pg113)This is how Edelman begins chapter 10, but I believe it is a good quote to sum up the positive and negative aspects of this book in general.I read and enjoyed his book. Parts were difficult and took a couple of reads. The difficult spots were usually cleared up by a rereading though and didn't diminish from a sense of hearing what he had to say and getting an impression of his view of consciousness."
5,LOVE this album,"Anyone I know with a record player gets one of these for their birthday... it's a rule. Plus, you get the free downloads with it as well. Perfect."
4,Great CD,This was a purchase after being blow away by their recent album - Casadaga. This old album (with some vocals by Emmylu Harris) is also amazing!
4,The focus helps,"I really love this album and if I could I would give it four and a half stars. Connor's music seems to be getting better with time. It's amazing what a little life experience seems to have done for his writing. Gone are the teenage musings which alienated so many from Fevers and Mirrors. Where Lifted... often felt like a collection of B-Sides, IWAIM is a very tight, cohesive album. All of these songs feel like they were written during the same period. Connor seems to have abandoned much of the pretense which characterized some of his earlier releases, something that aggravated more than a few listeners. The best part about IWAIM is that it takes only one or two listens to access. That's not to say that it's poppy, it's just easy to appreciate. As a sidenote, you should all check out AMG's review of the new Bright Eyes albums. For a guy that hates Oberst the reviewer seems to be incomprehensibly obsessed with him, writing the longest negative reviews I've ever read."
4,let it grow on you,"i bought this album because i liked oberst's song ""lover i don't have to love"" like the rest of the teenage population. when i first listened to it, i wasn't impressed; i'm into screamo and this just wasn't doing it for me. but i gave it a chance when i needed something to relax with and once you listen to the lyrics, and i mean really listen, you won't want to let go. he writes awesome poetry, with meanings that you have to reach for: ""there's kids playing guns in the street. and one's pointing his tree branch at me. so i put my hands up, i say enough is enough, if you walk away i'll walk away. and he shot me dead."" the writing is genius and the only reason it isn't five stars is because it takes about two days to grow on you or so, depending on the mood you're in. but this album is definitely worth the money."
2,"If you bought it, trash it... if you didn't, don't buy it.","No, I don't think so. I wasted my money on this record only to discover it was a feather light production (has that sort of brittle, plastic sound you hear on the Faint's ""Wet From Birth"" record... it fits there, perfectly... but here, Conor's trying to have ""soul"" and all that other good sh*# that comes with the territory of what he's trying to do) and diluted rehash of the general tone of his releases. This does not nearly reach the high water mark he set with the beautiful, organic work known as Lifted. If you dig that vinyl sound, and the pure kinetic weight of those drum fills you hear in ""Lover I Don't Have to Love,"" all the little mistakes and candid live band sound... you are not under any circumstances going to find it here. If you think this is for you and you don't have Lifted, please get that instead."
1,Who is Bright Eyes you're asking?,"Bright Eyes, simply said, is a much lauded singer-songwriter who has gained critical acclaim for his emotional and personal narrative songs. The amount of praise is most shocking, for unlike most of his singing-songwriting peers, Bright Eyes has virtually no talent at singing nor songwriting. His lyrics generally consist of a lyrical content you would expect to find in a 3rd graders poetry book, and the singing is unimaginative and outright dull. I am still yet to hear anything by Bright Eyes that sounds remotely interesting. Not only should you not buy this album, you should also keep anyone you know from this garbage."
3,Ripping people off,"Charming little record with an alarming habit of ripping off other artists. Does it bother anyone else that the plucking and chords of his hit song are a direct--I mean exact!--ripoff of Bob Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice It's Alright""?Bright Eyes fans, listen to Dylan's 1963 song and uh... wow. You might be a little shocked. I mean it's exact, people."
3,"Predictably good, Predictably not great","I would hate to call what Oberst does shtick. He obviously has talent, and has obviously been refining his technique to allow a broader audience without compromising his sound...in fact, not compromising it enough. Let's not overstate his songwriting abilities- they are keenly aware of taking traditional roots-rock forms and injecting edgy minor progressions, hardly more. Good move on his part then, to provide counterpoint with more electronic-based dabblings the same time as this release. He still has a ways to go writing that masterpiece everyone suspects he is capable of, hinting with a few of his most solidly strummed songs yet. Yet the whole album suffers from typical embedded mediocrity inherent throughout much of his predictable techniques (perhaps many forget this with the powerful standout 1-2 closing shots, a technique used all too often for falsely fresh aftertastes of questionable wholes)."
2,"Yeah, this isn't much good.","Conor Oberst's lyrics and songwriting just get worse and worse: while at least in the past he was able to write somewhat-interesting lyrics and come up with creative arrangements (such as the ""Every Day and Every Night"" EP), here he patronizes the remains of country music in a series of lachrymose, overwritten ballads that constantly strive after universal relevance, but just come off as self-righteous. The album's best moment is probably the single ""Lua"", but even that one's pretty lame. ""We might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain""? Deep, man.Self-pity and self-absorption have rarely made for interesting art, and no musings about ""What history gave modern man / A telephone to talk to strangers / Machine guns and a camera lens"" will change that."
4,Not all of us get our ideas from MTV...,"and those that do might not like this CD.Does Conor Oberst's voice have the ability to be grating for some? I'm sure. But it's nice to see someone who doesn't have an overly produced, or N'Sync/boyband-like voice use his talents to write music that is intelligent, beautiful and heart-wrenchingly honest.The Dylan comparisons stem, at least partly, from his unique singing voice- which, if you remember, many had the tendency to mock Dylan's singing capabilities. I can guarantee that those critics won't find that they are forever written into the annals of the best in songwriting history!If you think that Linkin Park (or however that putrid feces of a band mispells it's name to look cool) speaks to your adolescent anger, and you ascribe to the MTV mentality of music qualification, then you might not be able to find the simple and profound beauty in the songs on ANY of Bright Eyes MANY wonderful albums."
3,"Save your money, buy the DVD set(s) instead","I bought the soundtrack because I'm a big fan of the series and thought it'd be a nice accompaniment. I was very disappointed as I listened to this CD because it was quite plain that most of these selections must've been very muted background music. I could remember almost none of it and suspect that several selections are longer than they were on the show. #1 ""Main Title"" is the one we hear every week and is perhaps the most successful tune to my ears. #14 ""Badenweiler"" has similarities to ""Main Title"" as does #22 ""Wetsuits"". #25 ""Bristow and Bristow"" has a little of the title style but a lot of other stuff too and #26 ""SD-6 Dance Party"" just sounded like a pointless reworking of #25. #21 ""It was Anna"" was very short but good, nothing like the others I've mentioned."
4,Great series,"I read one Honor Harrington book and got hooked. I have read all the books, (not in order), multiple times, and have started collecting them one by one.My two favorites are Book 1= Basilisk station and Book 7 = In Enemy Hands.The stories are not predictable - which is nice, and has a lot of naval action, martial arts, romance, etc all tied in. Something to satisfy all tastes. Telepathic tree cats, religion etc"
4,"Not an Honor story, but good anyway","It's easy to say the Weber story was my favorite, and the Stirling story the next favorite, but I either adore David Drake's work or cannot stand it. This one I did both. I liked this book. It was just too short for a book of additional stories in the HH universe."
2,"dull, boring, slow",I saw the book. I bought the book. I tried to read the book. I threw the book away. David Weber should not have put his name to this book. It is not up to his standards and I'm dissapointed that he did.
4,Additional information enhances the Honor universe.,"Many Honor Harrington readers become rabid fans in short order.Often, for fans like these there can never be enough of a series to keep them happy, but this collaberative effort does more than offer a quick ""Honor fix."" The book offers three short stories and an essay, none of which are *about* Admiral Harrington herself, but all of which are entertaining and informative.The essay is by David Webber (the stories are by Webber and other notable authors, Drake and Stirling) and sheds a great deal of light on the details of the history, politics, science, and geography of the universe of the RMN... It is well thought through, entertaining, and fairly complete, the sort of details that will make any universe even more enjoyable to a thorough, intelligent reader.Although not an Honor Harrington book per se, this addition to the list of Webber's publications is well worth the while for anyone interested in who Honor is and where she comes from."
3,Faux Hardcover Book!,"I bought this book in paperback, and very much enjoyed it. I am not going to duplicate the other fine reviews of the content.I ordered the ""hardcover"" from Amazon because I was switching all of my Honor titles to hardcover editions. What I received was a little 6"" x 4"" mass-market paperback with a hard, shiny cover on it.Very disappointing for the price."
1,"Low content; not worth it, even for Lara Croft fans","This is a coffee-table type book that doesn't open flat. Lot's of computer graphic pictures of fictional Lara Croft, but almost nothing about the the history of Tomb Raider, the company or the people that developed it. You can read the whole text in 10 minutes, except for the ""fan fiction"" story in the back, which you really can miss. Oddly, what text there is it keeps referring to her ""kicking"" and shooting. What kicking?Just about any walk-thru posted on the 'net is better than those included here, which are seriously hampered by every other word being 15 times larger than the one before it and in some artsy color. Readability is about 0. What were they thinking (""Marketing"", probably). Save your money and visit Tomb Raider web-sites instead."
1,"Summary in three words:""Avoid this book""!","I am a big fan of Lara Croft, and try to get everything that has to do with her, most of 'em are good. BUT this book under review ""Lara's Book"" I hate!This book is not worth the paper that it is written on! The guides are inaccurate and confusing to read -- if you want a good walkthrough get ""The Tomb Raider Official Strategy Guides"" by Zach Meston, which are put out by Dimension Publications.The pictures (the only worthwhile thing about the book) can be found in other sources -- calenders, websites and so on.Finally the story . . . put me to sleep. Good night, ZZZZZZZ!"
2,Twisted?,"This book is exactly what the cover says... warped. It takes a slightly twisted mind to think up something like this. But if you like scary books, then this is for you. Once I got used to the idea, it wasn't that bad."
1,Space...the boring frontier........,"One has to be warped to read this boring wordy hardcover. I'm glad I only paid $3 bucks for it (2.99 too much in my opinion). The only good parts were the moments with Odo and Quark. Other than that it was a waste!! zzzzzzz..thats all you will do if you read this tedious, wordy novel. Boring boring boring !!!!!! No wonder it's thrown in discount bins around the galaxy. Live long and prosper but dont read this book!!"
3,Leaks,"It holds the diapers and washes well and everything, but it leaks like a sieve. It left a puddle in the bottom of my diaper pail, and these were not exceptionally wet diapers. It's disappointing because the smaller one for my diaper bag works wonderfully and never leaks at all."
3,Functional,"I have 2 of these pail liners. The size is good and hasn't leaked into my diaper pail. I do wish that they closed on the top though. We've gone on trips and brought this for dirty diaper storage, but you can't seal the bag to keep in smells. So, if you will only use it in a diaper pail with a lid it's fine. If you need it to be mobile, I would suggest finding another product."
4,"Excellent on basics, a bit dated...","Although out of date on the newest techniques, this book describes basic techniques very well, and is quite readable. I particularly liked how it describes cross-correlation and autocorrelation and gives some nice figures of how these techniques can be used to pull signals out of noise or measure the delay time of a received signal in noise (e.g. a reflected radar pulse). Perhaps it does not present the most rigorous mathematical descriptions, but it does a good job in describing the basic ideas without getting bogged down in a lot of details. I think it is a very good ""introduction""."
3,Fast read,Even though this was a book for class I enjoyed reading it. It was a fast and easy read and I would recommend all those feminists out there to purchase it.
5,Titanic Secrets,Have used this to show to science students---grade 9---now I have my own copy----came in great shape---thanks!!
5,Film Review,"The National Geographic has produced an outstanding film, here. As a Titanic buff, I have managed to accumulate, I think, every Titanic film produced. This, though, is the completely non-fiction documentation of what happened to the Titanic, and what the ravages of time have done to this disappearing great lady. This is an excellent film!"
1,Woah ... I may not get this after all!,"After reading the two previous reviews, I may not want to buy this. Hall's exclamation at the intro of Hard To Be In Love With You is ... essential! Well, at least to my ears and brain. And also, what's with the cover ... if I remember correctly, Daryl Hall's picture is different (Oates is the same); his jacket was off his shoulders and he is supposed to be higher up (don't mistake later pressings which had a coloured pic)Looks like I'm gonna stick with my Japanese paper-sleeve edition. At least that's faithful to the original. If BMG does redo the CD, please please put in the bonus tracks!"
3,More watching than learning,"This video is titled ""styles and techniques"" - it's a DVD of Joey Miskulin playing various differing types of music on the accordion and some of the types of music require him to play with a little different style. I was expecting some sort of lesson or at least tips on how to play better or faster or something - so that is why I gave it only 3 stars."
2,Willing to forget it,"If Mr. David would re-read Imzadi and try again, I'd be quite willing to forget this mess. It's only redeeming point is ending the Worf-Troi relationship. Obviously, Star Trek is not great literature, but if you don't have a good story, you don't have much of anything. I suggest re-reading Imazadi and filling in the blanks for yourself."
2,I agree with Marianne. . . .,"I have really enjoyed reading Peter David's books since I discovered him with the NG novel ""Stike Zone"". I was estatic when Imzadi came out, because it showed that someone was paying attention to past histories and believed that Star Trek should have romance - not just fleeting trysts evey week. Imzadi was magical, and left one feeling hopeful. Imzadi II fell far short in attempting to bring validity to a relationship between Worf and Troi. Just as the series did, however, the book failed to convince the reader that such a relationship was possible, much less believable. In light of revelations about Insurrection, the ending was abrupt, tackless, disappointing, and very unsatisfying. I had to read Imzadi right afterward, just to remind myself of the impact Troi and Riker's history together has on the characters and the readers, and now I am waiting very impatiently for the movie."
2,"This book is fine, but ...","This book is the worst book that I have read in stat thermo. The logic is not so good for a new comer to this field, for instance, the first chapter put the quantum mechanics in a several pages, which will discourage from enjoying the full flavor the later chapters. It looks like the autor is in great favor of tons and tons of equations and formulas, and talked little about the physics underlying the phenomena, which I personally think is very crucial. But it is definitely a good reference book for those who enjoy the exercise of deriving equations."
3,I don't know!,This would be a great du rag if the strings were not so short. I can remember in the early 1990's whenever I would get a du rag the strings were like this. If you are able to wrap the strings around your head like your supposed to you will not be able to tie the strins correctly unless you are a little kid!!!
4,They look okay,I have been having problem finding jeans that fit. I wear a size 8 but jeans seems to have been down sized in the hips and legs. These jeans are loose in the hips and legs they fit just fine. The waist is just a bit too loose but I would rather deal with that than not being able to bend my knees. The length is just right for casual shoes.
3,"Great fabric, but they run very big!","These are beautiful jeans, well made, great fabric but they run very very big. The size six is huge is more like an 8 or 10!"
1,Incorrect Sizing,"For years I have worn nothing but Lee Jeans, these will be the last ones I buy. The design quality and sizing have all taken a turn for the worst. These were so big I had to take them to a tailor to have them taken in even after washing them in HOT water. Very disappointed..."
4,Good principles to apply to youth work,"This book offers helpful ideas to evalute student ministry. It sets out your minstry in four phases. It offers sample sermons, activities and other ideas that can easily be addapted to your current ministry. Though not the best book on the market on purpose in ministry, it is helpful and especially a good resource if you are just beginning a ministry or rebuilding an old ministry from the ground up."
4,Hilde Gueden Sings Operetta,"Two pieces from this CD are jewels: The rarely heard and hard to find Nun's Chorus from Casanova by Strauss, which has an extraordinarily lush and unforgettable melody, and Vienna Blood, on which Ms. Gueden, whose voice is quite lovely, does a beautiful job.The rest of the CD is nice but not all that special. I bought it for the Nun's Chorus, and am very happy with it. Her rendition of both the aforementioned pieces is exquisite."
1,Not Carefully Planned For Even The Beginner,"I'll give Denise one star for being a nice person and meaning well. I have some of her other exercise videos, but she is NOT qualified to be a yoga teacher! I now have a lot of yoga videos. Most of them wisely emphasize the importance of proper breathing in the learning and practice of yoga, and Denise barely skims over this very important aspect of the practice. Without this instruction, the student misses the whole point and therefore cannot possibly benefit. That's reason enough to pass this one up--unless you want to watch Denise do a ""Look what I can do!"" routine."
3,GOOD WARM -UP OR BEGINNER,"Serves a good purpose if your not a Yogi, warm up try it and pass it on to someone. If you want more. One Yoga class costs as much as the video. I tried other Rachel Welch for example forget it you need 20 years exp. to do. This one is short enough so you do not have to organize your entire life around it."
4,"Good for Ideas, But Not a Get Rich Quick Guide","Intrigued by the title of this book, I bought it and carefully read it through. A very wide range of investments and companies are covered and every investor should find something that interests them.However, I would only use this book as a part of a comprehensive investment research plan. No book can guarantee success and indeed this one does not claim to. But it is a worthwhile read and can positively contribute to investment decisions."
3,Cajun Hymns,"Jo-EL Sonnier's music was new to me. I also bought some Cajun Christmas music by Sonnier and the more I listen, all his music sounds pretty much the same."
2,This book could have been a pamplet,"This is an interesting book, but does not really contain that much new information outside of the suggestion that you should be checked for high copper if you are a woman. Could easily be one of those pamplets in a health food store--distressing that the author spread it out so thin into a book."
5,Cutting Edge and Right On The Money,"After trying everything on the market to help my fatigue, I bought this book, started the diet, tried the supplements...and I swear, within three days, I feel better. I don't know if it is all in my head or not but something is working for the first time in years and I bet her theory on copper toxicity and zinc deficiency has something to do with it. I'm totally blown away."
1,"Pretty Good, But Few Need This Book",I thought this book made a mountain out of a molehill. What is the big deal with copper? My nutritionist said you need to be tested first...don't WORRY yourself by reading this book! Hair analysis is good--have one done. And THEN AND ONLY THEN if you are high and copper this book is right for you. Talk about a narrow subject!
2,Just read the book jacket - one million times,"The review titled ""Interesting thesis - boring delivery"" could not have said it better. At first, I found the book interesting. It was interesting to see that such a subject could be studied and a thesis-like approach could be used. But the conclusion of the book was on the book jacket. And it was repeated throughout the book. When I was finished with it - I felt really empty. The ""surprising secret"" of the wealthy? It was no secret and it was not surprising. Of course you have to be thrifty to become rich. The authors' advice was more or less ""never spend money"" and I think that is a wrong advice to give. You should work hard at life and with your hard earned money, you should use it wisely. Using big sums of money is not wrong - it can indeed be an investment if you are using it using it for purposes such as education. But if you are wasting money, even a penny is too much."
5,Superb -- You and Your Kids can ALL become millionaires!,"This book tells you exactly HOW to become a millionaire (from nearly any income or educational level) ... and how to help your children repeat your accomplishment ON THEIR OWN. If you and they both read this book, they'll INVITE you to donate all of your wealth to your favorite charities."
5,"""The Rich Are Different Than You and Me""","What makes them different, you ask? The answers are in this classic book on wealth building.Now, this is not a book about ""trust-fund babies"", or high-income professionals. It's a book about average Americans, and how they build and keep their wealth. (More importantly, it's about how any of us can do the same thing.)The advice here is timeless, and while some reviewers have said the information given isn't very valuable because ""everyone knows how to save money"", I have to disagree. Sure, people MAY know how to save money in their daily lives, but do they DO IT?The value in this book, I think, is that is makes one take a close look at spending habits, while giving the encouraging news that if you just take care of the pennies, the dollars will take care of themselves."
1,The Millionaire Next Door should get a life.,"The book espouses a dull life of frugality and pinching pennies that is desirable only to those with no sense of enjoyment or fun. I am sick and tired of hearing a bunch of Scrooges pat themselves on the back as a result of this book. With a sound investment strategy, you can make money and still life the good life. The millionaire next door can keep driving his beat-up car and 12-year old clothes, the rest of us will enjoy life. After reading this book, ask yourself, would you wnat to live like the millionaire next door? Or would you like to enjoy life. The answer provides a new perspective on the Millionaire Next Door."
4,Great must read book although a bit dated now,"This is a great must read book for anyone who wants to become a millionaire or is already one but wants to keep it that way.That said, it's a bit outdated now. For instance, the automobile section makes no mention of hybrid vehicles, which I'm sure a lot of millionaires drive these days. This is because hybrids were not invented when this book first came out in 1996.This is still a great book though!"
4,The mellionaire next door,"I had read this book about 15-20 years ago. At that time, the authors articulated many of the concepts and life style that I had naturley adopted. I was able to pass on some of the phiosophic consepts to my son & daughter. I re-ordered the book to review it and pass it on to my 3 grand sons.I agree with findings & conclusions from this book. it is really about ""common sense"" and self disapline."
4,Best Book ever,"I think The Millionaire Next Door was spot on when saying that people should learn to live within their means. We don't have to drive luxury cars, wear the finest clothes, send our children to the finest schools, or live in the biggest houses to make it to the status of millionaire. If the couple, mentioned in the book that averaged $90,000 a year income, can retire as millionaires then there is hope for the masses to reach this great mile stone. This book has also made me reevaluate the people that I see driving all the luxury foreign cars!"
5,Give this book to everyone you love,"My father gave me this book for Christmas 12 years ago, and let's just say that I put it to good use and am glad I did. My approach has been to buy what I want, wisely. I also cultivate an attitude of not wanting or needing a whole heck of a lot. But I don't live like a pauper by any means-- nor do I ever feel the need to buy a new luxury car (I drive a 2002 minivan which was used when I bought it and I'll drive it until a hybrid version comes to the US!). The onslaught of ""consumerism"" messages in our society is mind-boggling. This book goes a long way to validating the common-sense approach that allows you to steadily build wealth. But don't think it advocates a Depression-era mentality of fear and scarcity. I think it's more about learning to find joy, satisfaction and happiness in the simple things in your life. For example, my public library is one of my favorite places! This is a great book, read it!"
2,Frugality?,"I don't like the idea of living below your means, I like the idea of expanding your means. Although, this book gives you some interresting facts."
3,"Interesting, but too many pages.","This book is surely an interesting one, but too many repetitions and redundant information. It looks like authors were paid by the number of words rather than by the content. Somewhere in the moddle of the book you want to scream: ""Hey, i am not stupid. I got the point, stop repeating yourself !"" All ideas that are there are concentrated in the first 30 pages. Don't bother reading the rest."
3,Didn't learn much that I didn't read about the book,"I remember reading about this book when it came out. I read that the book said that people who have a million or more dollars don't spend money like people who have a much lower net worth: they drive good used cars for many years; they don't spend lots of money on status symbols; they live in simple homes...That's really the whole gist of the book! If you don't spend money, you'll be able to save more money. Of course.Also, if you don't spoil your kids, they'll learn to save more. Also, you'd better keep the same spouse all your life. Helps if you run your own business. Keep your same house until you pay it off. The wife is usually stay-at-home. Well, you get the picture anyway.This book was mildly interesting near the beginning, but then just became repetitious and, at times, insulting.Get it from the library if you're interested, but don't buy it. (You'll become a millionaire that much faster!)"
1,One good lesson rephrased a hundred different ways,"This has got to be the most monotonous book I've read in years, and that's saying a lot for somebody with a bunch of science and math textbooks on his bookshelf.I'm guessing the authors first draft was something like 2 pages long, and the publisher told him to bulk it up to a couple hundred pages so people will feel like they're getting something substantial for their $10.I'm here to save you the $10, and I'm sure the author would be proud that you're saving money already. Ok, are you ready? Most often, millionaires become millionaires because they are frugal. Tada!There will be 200 pages of that statement reiterated over and over again in the book if you're interested."
4,I've seen it happen,"I relate to this book. I think many who have earned good money but don't have a lot to show for it have. I don't mean the extreme examples in the book, but it is unfortunate if you have a good job and 5 years later have little to show for it. Many have both lifestyle and wealth, of course, and I don't think he acknowledges that. But to put lifestyle before wealth after a point is indeed silly and it was great to have real life examples of this. It is so easy to expand your lifestyle so, especially in professional services in a big city. Not clever people! And often bad for your health too."
4,The millionaire next door,"Everyone should read this book. If you want to be a millionaire, see how millionaires act."
2,Repetitive. It would have been a brilliant 10-page article,"This is another interesting book that could have been a 5 to 10-page brilliant article. Repetitive to the extreme, the authors go on and on and on and on...But I am glad I read this book.There is only one issue I wish was addressed. Being frugal and living below your means is good. After all, there is no need to spend hundreds of dollars in a watch or in shoes. However, there MUST be a balance in life. What is the point of having money if it is not to spend? Who needs lead a miserable life only to die with 5 million in net worth?I wish the authors would address this issue, or at least mention that there is a balance and this choice is beyond the scope of their book. Instead, it looks like the ""pursuit of wealth"" is a constitutional obligation of every citizen."
4,It shows many things people do & don't to accumulate wealth.,"This book covers every aspect of a millionaries life stlye, from the basics of not buying a house you can't afford to what kind of cars most milioners drive. Excelent book for people that drive $40,000 autos and live in $350,00 homes and make $100,000+ a year but have little or no investments and knowledge of money management."
4,It is a research and show you how a millionaire really is and behavior!,It does not show you how to become a millionaire and give you a full picture of a real millionaire!
4,"1st ""Book of the Month""","My new goal is to read one book per month, the do a short review on that book. I got this goal after becoming a huge Dave Ramsey fan. I read his book, Total Money Makeover and loved it. Now I listed to his free podcasts everyday.One of the books he highly recommends is The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley. This book will change the way you look at your next door neighbor, and the way you may think while driving through an upper class neighborhood. This book shows you how the tortoise continually beats the hair in the race to building wealth.The book does have it's boring parts and can often read like an owners manual with lots of statistical data. But between all the stats and data the book can be highly motivating to help you save instead of spend. You'll learn all about PAWS & UAWS and what it means to have a big hat and no cattle.Without going too much into it, I would say that although dull it is a good read with lots of hard core statistical surprises."
1,Waste of time and money,Not a good reading since there are a lot of good books to read. It is a pure waste of time and money.
1,"Painful to skim, impossible to read","A friend loaned me this book because it was 'so great'. I tried to read it, then I tried to skim it. Even skimming was painful. The message (millionaires accumlate wealth by sending less) was so simple it could have been written on a postcard. This message was repeated endlessly. No actionable steps were given. The book is a complete waste of time. Now, I'm reconsidering my assessment of friends who have liked this book."
5,Not a get rich quick book,"I received ""The Millionaire Next Door"" as a Christmas present several years back. It was a very valuable present, as it studies the behavioural patterns of millionaires in America. Contrary to popular belief, most millionaires do not earn high salaries, have mansions, or drive fancy cars. They are ordinary middle class people who are frugal, watch what they spend, make wise investment choices and live below their means. Buiding wealth is a simple formula: save more than you spend. It's as easy as that. Probably the best book on financial advice I have read."
3,How to be a millionaire after reading this book,This is a novel in which one can learn how to be successful and hopefully one day be their own millionaire. It's a quick read and a very informative book. It's full of typical millionaire stereotypes and how to spot a millionaire in your own neighborhood.
1,This is a book to make the authors richer.,"I bought the book (should have borrowed it), and found: 1. Not many new points, we should read the Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, or keep your parents' advices in mind; 2. Anyone who is keen in numbers, is self-disciplined or self-controlled, and knows how to search for advices in finance, should become rich; 3. Know what you're looking for in your life; 4. This book should be an article on a newspaper instead of occupying space in bookstores. It kills trees and makes the authors and the publisher richer."
4,a good book,This is a good book filled with some good information. It is somewhat of a boring read but the information makes up for it. I have read many books on finance and this book is filled with information not covered in other books.
3,A very dry read,"I'm surprised this book has such a good rating. Yes, it is informative and smashes the misconceptions people have about millionaires and how they spend their money. But it is also very repetitive, full of boring charts and statistics and overall a very dry read. I'm having to force myself to get through it."
5,Millionaire Next Door,This was exactly what I wanted and the book was in great condition. The description was spot on and I am very pleased with the purchase that I made
3,Cars by the pound?,"This is a best seller? This books reads like a college thesis, and although it has a few good points, I think they could have been made in a short article. My favorite part is the appendix, where the author's included their chart of automobiles by the cost per pound. Do millionairereally buy cars by the pound? Would not a usedcement truck prove to be a good investment?A silly little book with a good point or two that the public eats up- I was one of them since I bought the book."
3,Learning How to be CHEAP!!,"This book should be entitled ""Learning How to Be Cheap"", or alternatively, ""Wait Until You're Seventy-Five Before Living Your Life"", or even ""Penny-Pinching For Life!"". I was very disaapointed with this book. The authors do not tell the readers anything new, nor have they created a formula for building wealth. Simply stated, they have MERELY PUBLISHED RESULTS OF A SURVEY, in which the response rate was 45%. In addition, only 34.5% (or 385 out of a total 1115 respondents) had a net worth in excess of $1M. (see Appendix 1 of the book)."
2,Repetition-epetition-petition-etition-tition-itiontioniononn,"I'm amazed at the number of five-stars and four-stars for this book. As somebody else mentioned this book should have been a pamphlet. If you are a sucker for punishment, and need someone to smack you with a baseball bat for you to know saving is good, you may consider this book. Else, you would have come across most of what is said in this book, (all of two or three advices) anyway and with any common-sense would have acted on them.One bright side to this book. I am very hopeful now that I can write a book someday, and make a lot of money. I am quite sure I can come up with one or two semi-original ideas and use them to fill up a book, and find enough suckers to buy it. How's that for a retirement plan?!"
2,Basic common sense knowledge,"This book could have been written in 25 pages or less. It was the same thing over and over and over and over... Anybody who reads this and realizes for the first time that if they buy a two year old Ford truck over a brand new Range Rover they will have money left to invest needs a lot more help than any book could provide. This is the same basic information my parents have been trying to instill in me for the last 24 years. I'll sell you my copy for $7.50. (See, you're already on your way!)"
2,PhD's cram 7 aphorisms into 258 pages,"This book should've been an essay. I found it overstated and repetitive. Some useful information, but mostly intuitive. Eric Tyson's ""Financial Planning for Dummies"" was far more valuable and better organized."
3,Useful but incredibly depressing!,"This is not a bad reminder of what we all know--save and invest for better financial health. But the lifestyles of the millionaires mentioned were depressing! ""My favorite charity is me""???!!! These aren't the kind of people that made our country great--these people are caricatures--an extreme end of the spectrum where greed is the motivating factor for everything!. I don't buy it"
4,This is what millionaires do?,The book is great for people who wants to start over with their life and make sure that they have money for them and there children.I feel that the book is basically showing people the step of life and how to manage your money.
4,Ready to save,"While this book is rather dry at parts, if you're truly interested in making the most of your money, you'll benefit from its insight. There are several things I keep in the back of my mind whenever I'm tempted to overspend: most millionaires drive regular cars, not new, fancy ones; and most don't live extravagantly, they work hard, spend wisely and let the majority of their money grow. Essentially, most millionaires live like middle class folk, they just know how to live within their means."
2,Not really impressed!,This book was written years ago and although it was ground breaking information then it basically gives statistics and generalities on the rich. Its message about being frugal and investing is repeated in a number of wealth building books. Not worth the hype!
1,10 mins read,"if you can get this book for $3 including shipping, then it is worth reading.The book tells people who are millionaires live below their means. they don't buy fancy cars, they don't eat out often. they shop around to get good deals on stuff etc etc.don't expect to find any tips on making money through stocks etc."
1,Self-help book for sale,"If you are a cardiologist pulling in more than $300,000 a year, waste all your money on country clubs and Range Rovers and can't figure out why you haven't banked a million bucks yet, this is the book for you. Well, it would be if you had the humility to follow advice. However, if you are trying to raise three kids on a government mid-manager's $40,000 a year and would like to improve your plight, this author has little use for you. I would be $10 closer to being a millionaire if I hadn't bought this book. Hey - at least I did buy it used."
3,quality of book,I had a hard copy of this book before. However this book I purchased is so hard to read. The ink is too light and the quality of the material seems that I got what I paid for. I may have to get another copy. Can I return this for a better copy?
3,A Sociological Study on the Characteristics of Millionaires,"This is a scientific sociological study on the characteristics and personality traits of millionaires. The reader will find the statistical findings very boring - only a university sociologist will appreciate. For example, millionaires prefer to drive American-made cars, live in average homes, wear clothing bought at Sears, seldomly eat out, own few credit cards, and send their kids to college - state supported rather than private to save money..The most important message was how they made their wealth. People became millionaires because they worked hard and long hours, spent their money only on essentials, married spouses who were also frugal if not more, and placed their savings into investments..What the study did not tell the reader was that anyone can become a millionaire by age 65. Beginning at age 25, put $350 into a tax-free 401K account every month. Assuming a 7% return each year, the account will grow to $1,000,000 by age 65."
3,"An average how-to, but good documentary","I skipped many parts of this book, as it contains too many statistics, maybe it was intended for the cynics. However, the writer made a good and reasonable point at the very beginning of the book. This book would make a good material for documentary, as there are many surprising facts about millionaires. But if you want to be wealthy, this is merely a good start. It gives you the right attitude about wealthiness.You will also have a question some time after finishing the book; ""if you will have to live frugally, why do you want to be wealthy in the first place?"" or ""How can I cash out my investment to enjoy life?"""
5,The Millionaire Next Door Product Review,I received the book within a few days. It was in a great shape (practically new). The previous user took really good care of it.THANKS-PRINCE
3,Good to add to your bookshelf,"Very well written, yet many charts and graphs appeared rather meaningless and were very difficult to interpret. Excellent examination of how the millionaires accumulate wealth, but few admissons of enjoying their wealth. The tragedy is that many millionaires don't leave much money to their off-spring, yet the don't enjoy life more fully either. My work with entrepreneurs (and many authors on the subject) uncover that one will start their own business for freedom of work, financial independence, and enjoying the finer things in life. This book doesn't talk much about the enjoyment of life.Another OMISSION statistic in their discussion about Ross PEROT ( and how much he saves) leaves out the amount that he wasted on his bid for the presidency.Although insightful, to obtain millionaire status, reading and educating yourself on investing will get you there quicker than just the savings on an above average income."
3,Academic Overtones Throughout,"I found this book to be highly informative, but overall a little redundant. The information was provide in an academic format, and the chapters are set up more like an outline, than a story. Overall, I'd say this is well worth your time to read."
4,Chilling,"I have to admit, up to the very end of this book, I was expecting a happy ending. I was expecting that something positive might come out of it. What a terrible worst case scenario that will chill you and keep you entertained at the same time."
4,Great Player for money,This player is a good DVD player for the money. We use it on long trips so our daughter can watch movies. I have also used it personally. I bought it because I had an iPod but found it does not work with the 5thgeneration iPod. The picture is black and white. I was not too concerned about it because I don't rent or buy a lot of movies from iTunes. Because of the problems I had with the iPod I rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5.
2,WEAK,"Amateurish production quality, ""Far Reaching"" assumptions about debris floating around the space shuttle cargo bay. Most of the video is a Physics 101 lesson by a droning young scientist. Lots of filler and fluff, very little interesting photos."
2,Deaver not at his best,"After having listened to my first Deaver Audio, The Devil's Teardrop, I expected the same quality, suspense and superb thrilling listening. Don't waste your money on this audio. The reader, Joe Mantegna did a miserable job of trying to create the character's Carolinian dialects. Simply awful. The story was hard to follow and I had to listen to the first two tapes three times to get the characters straight. The ending is the biggest disappointment of all - no real thrill here. This was an average, run of the mill book, with no new creativity in the mystery genre. Think twice before buying this audio book."
4,Very Good!,"In this novel, Rhyme and Sachs are in North Carolina, as Lincoln Rhyme is about to go through a medical procedure, to help with his condition. However, Rhymes is met at the hospital, by the local sheriff (a cousin of one of Rhymes' friends), who asks for his help in tracking down a local troubled teenager, who it seems has murdered one man and kidnapped two young women.I found this book an enjoyable read, from the start. As the cases progresses, you think it will be straight forward enough : examine evidence, catch kid, free women. But, then there is one twist followed by another, that throw you off track, and have you wondering who are the good characters, and who are the bad. It kept me very interested throughout."
4,The Empty Chair,"Great book! I have never read anything before by Jeffry Deaver, but will definitely look for more by him. This book was a surprise at every turn. Just when I thought I had it figured out, there was always a big surprise."
3,OK - one twist to many,"I like the Lincoln Rhyme novels. I think I am in love withSachs, but Mr Deaver cannot resist overegging the puddingwith yet ANOTHER plot twist and then ANOTHER.In ""The Empty Chair"", Rhyme and Sachs transplant quite wellto South Carolina. Small town attitudes are quite well drawnby Mr Deaver.But Sachs actions are unbelievable, the trial contrived and thelast 2 plot twists too much."
2,Exciting Thriller? Rename this book Empty Promises!,"From its boring title to its cast of cliched southern rednecks, the Empty Chair disappoints from the very beginning. The storyline about a teen killer/kidnapper obsessed with insects is interesting, but the story quickly dissolves into a half-baked tale of southern intrigue that never offers any excitement. Deaver tried to save the book by pulling about a dozen rabbits out of a hat near the end of the novel, but many of these surprises and plot twists make no sense at all, and after the third or fourth one, the reader just gets tired of the whole thing. Deaver also tries to wrap up every plot conflict with a neat little bow at the end, but he leaves out most of the explanations which only leaves readers scratching their heads and wondering what happened. Try the earlier books in this series, both of which were far better reads."
2,Not this author's best effort,"What starts as an interesting story turns into an overly long and drawn out premise with an overly convenient ending. This was one of those books that just kept going and going for no real reason. It desperately needed to lose some weight and have the pacing tightened up. After dragging myself through this one, I just didn't feel like it was worth it, especially when I got through the silly trial scene where Amelia is facing murder charges. Rhyme and Co. should have stayed in the Big Apple."
2,Oh puhleeease!,"Oh! There aren't enough words to say how dreadful this novel is! Implausible story! Embarrassingly stereotypical characters! Emotionally challenged women, super-macho men! How impossible that so many people in such a small town could ALL be involved in murder! I physically cringed when, in the middle of a stand-off, as a man is lying on the floor bleeding from a gunshot wound, the person who goes to his aid is told, ""One thing, he's gay. He's been tested, but.."" How outrageous is that! Just because a man is gay, you're supposed to automatically assume he might have AIDS?! Several times I wanted to throw the book away, but I just had to know if the story redeemed itself in the end. No, it didn't! Avoid this trainwreck of a book!"
3,"They're nice, but a bit too small for my taste",". .which was my fault. I should have paid attention to the size before ordering. The pillows are made well and I cut the tags off so no ripping occurred. I was surprised that another reviewer said the pillows that a bad smell because my pillows had no smell whatsoever! They're not bad as I said, just small."
3,This is a good kids' flick.,"Watch the little guy named ""Rudy."" For a first-time actor, he's pretty cool. For those of you who recognize ""Mary Margaret"" (Jamie Renee Smith), you probably also caught her in ""Dante's Peak,"" with Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton. ""Fowl Play"" is a pretty good kids' flick - it is the sequel to ""Magic in the Mirror,"" but you can understand ""Fowl Play"" without seeing the first edition. Corny, Three Stooges-type comedy, but enjoyable nevertheless."
3,Purple Cane Road review,I like James Lee Burke's work. This particular book seemed to wander more than usual. To me it seemed somewhat disjointed. A tougher read than usual.
4,If you enjoy Burke's style you will like this book.,"Typical Burke in his south La sequence. The author's bio does not reveal where his cop and prison scenes are drawn from, where ever he paints seemingly realistic pictures. Good quick read."
2,Disappointed in the selections,Not enough of his hits. The selection was not good and title was deceiving.Baa Baa Baa the 20word is a BAD idea.... Bad Idea Bad idea I hope I have 20 by now.!!!!!!!
4,another KARA book...,"this is a good book but i'm gonna tell you right now that if your NOT a fan of kara, then don't expect much from the story. Adriane is my favorite character and is the most interesting to me. Emily is good too and so is kara, but she makes the story a little boring to me. usually i put 5 stars for all the avalon books but this one almost put me to sleep! but don't get me wrong cuz it's still an important part of the whole avalon storyline. Anyway, the main story is kara gets sucked down a portal into the fairy realms where she has to restore peace between the fairies and the goblins. She also has to save her feline friend Lyra before its too late. Even though i wish this was an Adriane book i still reccomend it all the same."
4,prompt arrival,"Arrived promptly and in fairly good condition. Very pleased with my purchase. Only problem was underlined in parts by previous owner, other than that it was exactly what I was looking for, and exactly as advertized. Would order from again."
1,Buyer beware,"This book is so outdated. All the techniques listed in this book are from the 1980's and earlier, which means that most of the things you can learn from this book are already learned by you from the past. There are much more recent interesting researches and discoveries of human nature you can find in other books."
3,"Not great, but fun.","Certainly, the book doesn't do what the author claims. But you figured that out already I'm sure.On the other hand, it's got some fun (manipulative, but fun nonetheless) psychological tricks in it. It also puts your mind in the right place about how _others'_ minds work. It's crazy how self-centered our thoughts can be, and a little insight like this can help you get what you want out of a lot of situations involving people.Try it out: It's dirt cheap and it's an entertaining read."
4,Very Good Suggestions,I found great joy from this book. Excellent practical suggestions based on psychological research. Highly recommended.
1,Trite,After reading several books on psychological persuasion I got down to this one in the pile. What a disappointing waste of money & time. It feels like this book was writen over a few weekends by someone who was writing this book for the money and had no passion for the subject. While many principals are covered they are ill-explained and without any of the depth I got from reading other books. Not reccommended.
4,Manipulation,"The title of the book is using his own thoughts, it could me called ""Manipulation"" and it probably wouldn't sell as many copies. You realize that you have the power before reading the book, it's just a matter of understanding and weilding that power."
1,Rubbish,"If you read enough of these kinds of books, you'll come to realise which authors actually know their stuff, and which only have a massive ego and skill in marketing themselves. I can tell you right now, Lieberman falls into the latter category.He seems like an American version of Paul Mckenna - all smooth showmanship with a paid-for Ph.D.Do you want to get anyone to do anything? Well, there is no book on the planet that can give you a fixed, rigid strategy to do that - none at all. The better, more sensible books on this subject will offer you a selection of principles that require you to use your own creativity.For example, if you want a decent book on influence, check out the work of Robert Cialdini. His book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion will give you more to work with than twenty books of Lieberman's drivel."
5,This is a must for all readers regardless of who you are.,"This book offers advice to such questions as: how to be accepted and not seem to be trying, making that first impression as good as gold, finding out if someone is fooling you, how to take control of every situation, how to score points in a job interview or big date, and what it takes to be a leader. And the steps are very forward and flow very well so theres no confusion with any psychological terms. The book is seperated into individual chapters so every question is short and easy to understand."
2,Poor transfer,"Even though the box claims a digital transfer, the source elements must be poor. Sections of the film are too dark, and it is noisy and grainy throughout. This film needs a more serious restoration than provided here."
5,Fenomenal,"Admiro muchisimo a Allende, como mujer y como escritora. He leido todas sus obras y en especial Paula dejo una huella muy profunda en mi. Allende mueve su alma y la abre ante el mundo para enseñarnos a aceptar la vida tanto como la muerte de un ser querido. Nos demuestra que estamos preparados para muchas cosas en la vida, pero jamas para la muerte de un hijo. Bravo nuevamente por Isabel Allende."
2,paula,"I am currently reading it and have read about 100 pages. It is well written, but a very sad story."
1,no good anymore,"After they changed the formula for this lipstick, it has a distinct sweet taste to it. It is just no good anymore. Too bad, it was a great lipstick"
5,love love love,"I absolutely love this book for elementary organic. It explains everything so easily and in a way I could really understand. Whats really helpful is how it has practice problems after each section in each chapter, so by doing them after reading you actually remember the information. Well, you remember it more than if you didn't do the problems, anyway. I would recommend buying the answer key that goes along with it though because the answers that come in the back of the book are quite limited."
3,adequate for the Bonanza fanatic,"Not many episodes, but at least they spring for the real theme music, unlike other Bonanza dvd's."
2,falls apart way too easily; not good for cycle-commuting,"I thought this jacket was too good to be true when I bought the hoodless, cycling version, and indeed, it was. Yes, it's inexpensive, light, packable, keeps rain out, surprisingly breathable, and even U.S.-made. The fuzzy liner keeps the jacket from sticking to your arms. However, for regular, rainy-day commuting (as in Seattle), this jacket is just way too fragile and barely lasted me a couple months. The outer, pored layer is extremely thin and fragile. Unlike ripstop nylon, once it starts ripping, it's hard to stop, and it's easy to rip this stuff. Let's just say you should make sure to have your fingernails filed before handling it, and I recommend against tossing it in your pannier without the protection of a plastic bag. Given its short useful life, I'm not really sure if this jacket is good for anybody's needs...definitely not for commuters. I bit the bullet and went for a Burley jacket and couldn't be happier...well worth it."
1,poor,the program wouldn't let me save my designs-- an error message appeared every time I tried to save
4,Sad story told in a unique style,"Kaye Gibbons has given us a heartbreaking story, well written and so believable and honest, it is almost painful.Ellen is an 11 year old who has been forced to make adult decisions most of her young life because her mother is very ill, and her father is cruel and unfeeling. Her story alternates between her past, when she lived with her parents, and the present, where she now lives in a foster home.I lived the same sort of life Ellen did, had such a similiar childhood that it was almost eerie when I read the book. The thoughts and reasoning of a neglected 11 year old that is portrayed in this book are so on target that I feel very sure that either this must be partially an autobiographical novel by the writer, or either she has talked to the real ""Ellen"". Ms. Gibbons has captured the truth, and written it in such a way that only someone who has experienced this could write about it.Great read, my only complaint is that it was too short!!"
3,Left me Smiling at the End,"Made me want to hug Ellen and all the other children like her. I liked it much more than A Virtuous Woman, but it still left me with the feeling that I would have liked to see a longer timeline. What happens to Ellen?"
2,unless your really sappy over cheesy books dont read this,"First off, whoever compared Ellen with Holden Caulfield should be shot. That is defacing a great nove. Second, does Ellen ever stop being a pain. I don't feel simpathy for her at all. It almost aggrivates me that this book was written. I give it one plus for the way it is written since I do find this very creative how the author uses past and present tense in telling one story. But thats as good as it gets. TRust me. Don't read it. Its just dull and annoying.Some might say it made them cry...it made me cry too...out of pain"
2,yuck,I've read other books by Kaye Gibbons and this one can not be counted as one of her best. The sort of stream of concious writing made me want to just get through the book instead of enjoying this highly recommended book. Each page made me cringe as I made myself read paragraph after paragraph. I can't believe that Oprah has such bad taste in books.
4,Very good and thought provoking book.,"Ellen Foster is a great book for anyone. It is written in conversation style, making it more tedious to read, but it is still interesting. At times, you can laugh with Ellen and sometimes feel sympathy for her."
4,An excellent book to read,"I just finished reading Ellen, because I had to for school. It was a touching story about a girl who had true courage. She did this because she had to, and these things happen all the time in our society so the concept wasn't new to be;however the writing helped express this lifestyle from the girl's point of view. It was the inside feeling of Ellen, which the Kaye expressed that I liked most about the book. It is a book I would encourage people to read."
5,Strength and Determination,"While reading this book, I saw a very strong, clear thinking, determined and self sufficient child. Her motto of doing it her 'own self' reminded me of my independence as a child.Yet, when I saw the movie, I didn't see an empowered child. I saw a sad story of an abused and abandoned child. I laughed through the book because you couldn't tell Ellen that she wasn't in control. The girl had a plan. Yet the movie left me so choked up that I almost felt bad that I hadn't realized how alone this child was before.I am glad I read the book first. I think the author intended to show this from Ellen's perspective and not the department of children and family services.Oft times, people write off childrens' spirit's and strength and turn them into mindless/feelingless being who need their lives to be decided upon by not so informed adults.Yes, Ellen Foster was a tragic story. But it was also a story of great courage a thinking mind.It was this book that made me a Kaye Gibbons fan !"
3,Easy reading,An easy book to read when you just want to relax. Racism is still a big issue and reading this book will highlight some of the issues faced.
3,Not the best writing but a good story,"The story kept me turning the page. I enjoyed the complexity of the character going from past to present. Some of the experiences that Ellen had to undergo seemed horrific but I feel the author lacked the ability to create a few of the scenes without too much graphic description and still help me understand what happened. I felt that the author's own experience was sometimes leaking into Ellen's character, for instance, at one point Ellen made a reference to the responsibility of a job...how did this little girl, raised by an irresponsible father and a mother who was ill, have any way of understanding the demands of a regular job? One assumes that she hadn't worked at a job outside her home nor had she seen either of her parents working regularly. The ending left more to be desired."
2,Choppy to read,I know it was supposed to be choppy as it is written from a child's perspective but I had a hard time following her train of thought at times. I much preferred the end to the beginning.
3,"Heavy dialect, heart-tugging, sometimes too jumpy","Ellen Foster lives a hard life of both mental and physical abuse. Told in first person by Ellen, the heavy dialect and occasional missing scenes (you can assume what wasn't shown--?) can be confusing. I expected to love the book, but found it difficult to finish, despite its brevity. I did finish it, and it was all right, but definitely not great. This is one of Oprah's few misses."
4,"Refreshing, entertaining, touching. A quick, easy read.","I thoroughly enjoyed my first introduction to Kaye Gibbons and promptly visited the library for her other titles after finishing ""Ellen Foster."" It reminded me of ""Catcher in the Rye"" and other coming-of-age tales. Ellen is a fiesty child with a wonderfully wry sense of humor. I was totally surprised when my eyes welled up with tears at the ending. It's a rare book that makes me cry. I have suggested this book to several others and think it should be on school reading lists. I am new to the South and really enjoyed this slice of life by a Southern author."
2,GOOD PLOT; POORLY WRITTEN,"I don't like to have to wade through a book, but I surely had to wade through Ellen Foster. Does lack of punctuation throughout (especially quotation marks) establish one as an author? Very confusing story. Incidentally, not by any stretch of the imagination can this be referred to as a ""novel."" It is barely 145 pages in length; I believe that constitutes a ""novella."" I read so many upbeat reviews about ""Ellen Foster,"" I hurried to my local library to check it out. I have very gifted grandchildren, any one of who could have written this ""booklet"" so that it flowed for the reader. If this is the author's established style of writing, I do hope she isn't planning to afflict us with a second story. This was a good plot gone to waste."
2,A book that leads to nowhere,"This book follows the life of Ellen. Growing up in the south, her life is filled with racism, abuse and neglect. It seems that all Ellen wants is a place to belong.I found Ellen Foster to be a very depressing book rather than the uplifting book that it was rumored to be. The writting is hard to follow espesially during Ellen's narrations of her conversations. The book is deeply soaked with symbolism, making even more confusing.Overall, I guess that this just has to be a genre that you enjoy, for you to like the book. If you like Scifi/Fantasy like I do, this is not the book for you! Instead try the Golden Compass or The Once and Future King."
2,Shudder,This book made me feel icky when I first read it for a seventh grade class (I went to a very progressive middle school). I remember saying that it felt like the author just got severely depressed halfway through. My teacher then told me that I was very perceptive because the author was actually manic depressive. No surprise there. Basically just a novel that gives me an ominous feeling. Would never recommend this book because of the very strange feeling it gives me. Why do books like this always end up on Oprah's Book List?
3,Sad,Not really my kind of book and not sure why I read it at all. I did feel for Ellen. She just couldn't seem to get a break until the very end. Even then she seems to have distanced herself from her new family.
3,Almost as described,"I received the master cylinder in a extremely fast time but unfortunately I did not receive all the items as described. The actual ad says it includes the master cylinder, resevrvoir and its cap along with a brake switch. All I received was the master cylinder. Beware. Ask plenty of question prior to buying from this company. Make sure that its not incomplete like my order is."
1,Not a typical middle school,"This author fails to accurately identify the environment of the school where she did her research. It is more reflective of an urban environment than a suburban one. The school consists of a population with many more students who are what would be considered at a low socioeconomic level than students who are middle class. She does a poor job of reflecting a true picture of schools which are typical suburban schools in the area. Hmmm...would I want my child attending a school where some reporter goes into a school and is allowed to do this? Also, reporting inaccurate information on classroom situations is just one of her many errors. Sensationalism is what sells books and she sure uses that in her attempt to portray middle schoolers. DO NOT BELIEVE what you read! She is a reporter for a newspaper."
1,The Hidden Lives of Jewish Children only,"This book is not beneficial to any teacher who teaches school in the USA. This book just makes middle schools who are not raised as Jewish appear as if they struggle, meanwhile the Jewish students are illustrated as good, wholesome, regular students, with regular adolescent problems. This book was extremely bias and unbelievable. I would never recommend this book to anybody working on becoming a more effective teacher."
3,May not be for the contemporary reader...,A detailed and seemingly well-researched book that is very hard to read and understand because most quotations from non-English sources were left in their original language.
4,Great Resource!,"I love the way that this Bible is laid out. When you open it to a page all of the matching verses for all 4 translations are there. The only problem that I see is that the print is fairly small making it hard for some people to read, but this book is fairly thick already so if they made it bigger it would weigh a TON! Overall it is a great purchase."
4,Excellent Camcorder,I recently got new Canon DC100. I was using Sony TRV350 for last 2 years and so was a bit shaky going for Canon. But it seems I did the right thing..The new camcorder has almost the same recording quality as that of Sony. Audio quality is even better. The size and convenience of use is just incomparable.More to that it directly writes to DVD. So now onwards no need to spend hours burning CDs/DVDs. Simply superb!!!The pros could be absence of memory card. I will seriously miss that with my new Canon.But All in all its a good deal...
2,Not worth your money,"My old Sony Hi8 is getting a bit ancient and it is time to replace it. After researching dozens of digital camcorders, I decided to obtain one with records on DVD so that we can easily play our recordings on DVD players. I settled on the DC100 as it seemed to be a vert good middle-of-the-road model that should have been good enough for my family and casual use. I also had very good experiences with Canon digital cameras.The end result is that this was a disaster. While the DC100 is cute and small, the bottom line is that:- the picture is very grainy- colors are washed out- video playback is choppyBased on this, I am returning the DC100 and moving to a MiniDV-formatted camcorder, probably one of the Sony model."
2,DVD Camcorder,The features of the camcorder are user friendly. The problem encountered was camcorder failure to initialize the DVDs---unable to playback on DVD player.Butterfly Photo was accomodating for product return/exchange.
1,Dissapointed,Don't buy this camera. Video is very grainy and shaky.I thought fo 500 bucks I would get great quality video.My old one was not even digital and it had better quality than this. I called Canon and they said the DC model came out in December (2005) but nobody has yet complained about picture quality. Well now you have one. I'm going to return it now I just hope they take it back
2,What's the Big Deal?,"I purchased this CD on the basis of the glowing reviews here on Amazon and I'm just scratching my head after listening to it five times. It's just not that funny. There's a few good moments, but nothing to support all the five star reviews. I see Amazon has it on sale today for $2.99 and sadly, I'm not certain it's even worth that amount of cash. Save your money and buy some George Carlin- a true master of comedy."
3,Cold Deck... about sums it up,"While having read mostly JT Edson's works, I find this one to be somewhat lengthy in setup and finishes too abruptly. Mind, I understand this is merely Fiction, but not one of JT's most notible. It's a good read, keeps you wanting more... that's for sure. In all, I think if you are interested in a quick read on a long flight, this will most certainly suffice."
2,Name-calling,"I was disappointed in this story. A goose is riding around on a scooter knocking people and things over. The humor relies on the goose knocking things down, which is not what I want to teach my kids. At the end, the animals say that they need to stop this ""fool"" (meaning the goose). I do not want my kids to think it is okay and funny to call people fools or any other kind of not-nice name. The behavior might be foolish but it is not nice to call someone a fool. My kids are young enough that these lessons are still a big deal and they aren't old enough to filter that kind of thing out. I realize that I am probably more uptight than many people about this type of thing, but if I had known this about this story, I would not have bought it. So, this review is for the other fuddy-duddies like me. :)"
5,It cooles very well,It cools very wellI have 3.0ghz core 2 duo oc to 3.6ghz it cools it with no problems regardless if idling or gaming.Make sure u get good thermal paste and you should be all set
1,Not So Quiet,Got this reading reviews from others and installation was easy. There were two little plastic screw holders missing but I was able to find from my inventory and I was able to install this. The thing I noticed that the fan is quiet but the air that goes thru those copper winding is not. Even when I put my PC to sleep this thing is still loud. I went back to my original Intel cooler and that's quiet.Too bad I can't return this crap.CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9450 @ 2.66GHzWindows XP w/ 3GHzASUS Motherboard P5QL/EPU
5,Cool and Quiet!,"Very impressed with this cooler. Shipped computer from Connecticut to California and this cooler did not loosen up one bit. Runs cool and quiet while looking totally baddazz. I feel this is a great value for a CPU cooler. Highly recommended.My build:Intel Core i5 2500KEVGA Intel P67 SLIEVGA GTX 570 HD DSCorsair XMS3 8 GB DDR3 1333(2) WD VelociRaptor 150GB 10,000 RPM Hard DrivesASUS 24X DVD-RW DriveCorsair 650W 80 Plus Gold AX650Zalman CNPS9500 AT CPU CoolerPRO-55U Card ReaderRheosmart 3 fan controllerWindows 7 PRO 64-bit"
4,"""Legend"" is a Legend","This mystical tale by Pressfield not only captures the finer points of golf but also allows us to contemplate the lost art of sportmanship. If you enjoyed the movie, you'll be glad you took the time on this short, easy to read novel. The Legend of Bagger Vance intertwines both the history of golf and wonderful fictional lore; a must for any golfer young or old."
4,Very good - Very different from the movie.,"I read this book after seeing Robert Redford's movie of the same name. Interestingly, Redford both added to, and took away from, the book in order to arrive at the story for his movie.The book is intended to be a modern version of the Bhagavad Gita, told using golf as a metaphor rather than war. It is an ambitious effort by Pressfield that comes across far darker and deeper than the movie. Redford, on the other hand, focuses his movie on portions of the book and gives it a lighter feeling, making it a more clear-cut tale of redemption.Both are very good, but they are also very different. I highly recommend the book even if you've already seen the movie - you'll only recognize a little of what's here."
4,Worth the price and buy it in hardback!,"This book will run the gambit of reviews. Some will love it, some will make fun of it, some will lie about it, some will just walk around with it having never read it and hope someone just sees them walking around with it. I enjoyed it. I read it in two sessions and if it hadn't been for having two teenagers I would have read it in one. I will read it a second time. Great story by a man who obviously loves the game and loves to write. If you love the game I believe you will love this book and not give a hoot what anybody else thinks. Well done Mr. Pressfield."
5,Absolutely fabulous - Couldn't put it down!,"Although I'm not much of a golfer (where is my ""authentic swing!""), this book grabbed hold of me immediately and didn't let go. Pressfield so effortlessly transported me back to 1931, I really had the feeling I was part of the gallery watching that epochal match. His descriptions of both Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones were wonderful, but more thought-provoking were the journeys into Indian mysticism (along those lines I also recommend ""Be Here Now"" from the Hanuman Foundation). Even if you've never hit a golf ball, you're in for a treat with this book."
5,Amazing book,"This book was absolutely astonishing. The explosive visualizations that it induces and the heart pounding, page turning dialogue make you want to read the whole thing in one sitting. The mystery in the characters is so awesome. The messages are very real and do apply. Read this book, it WILL become one of your favorites."
5,this is a killer record,"man, this is one of the best cd's ive heard in a long time. russell can sing so well, and the band is tight!!! if you like old school rockabily and doo wop this is the one!!! excellent!!!"
3,Corporate synthpop?,"Oh man!!...has corporate found it's way into the realm of synthpop? This just sounds too much like it was really written for Britney Spears.Okay, so that may or may not be true...actually, this is more in the vein of Imperative Reaction...hard-hitting futerpop/ebm. Crash is the strongest track on the single and, minus vocals, is all synth...other tracks incorporate guitars (there's that word, ""corporate"").Eh..I might buy the full-length album. But so far Mesh hasn't left a memorable impression.As an update, I really do enjoy the ""Alien Six Kerosene Remix"" mix of Crash, and is worth buying the single for it alone...one of my favorite songs these days. Gives me a little hope for this band's future. :-)"
1,Displeased,"I should've taken the time to read the reviews on this because I would have been aware of the disreputable product this seems to be. The footage is grainy and what's worse is there's no narration, therefore making it difficult to recognize much of what is being viewed. Also, the running time of the video is a disappointment, it is incompatible with the asking price.Very poor product. NOT RECOMMENDED!!"
2,Not that great,"Barbara Delinski is a great author, but this book was one of her worst. I could barely get through it. Also, you start to get annoyed with the character Liz, who is obviously being stupid, and you don't want to deal with her anymore. Don't waste you time with this book, Delinski has done so much better."
3,Pads are difficult for kids to put on themselves.,"Helmet is fine, but elbow and knee pads have two shorter straps rather than one long strap, and they are difficult (not impossible) for my kids to put on. Still better than nothing. Thanks for reading. Dr. 9"
5,Very Satisfied,The ION TTUSB05 turntable was delivered when expected and it works great! I had to contact customer support for one issue and they responded within 24 hours and the problem was fixed. I am very happy with this product.
1,Large Disappointment,Very unhappy with product. Does not provide good quality sound and itself is of very poor quality.The unit I received as a gift was missing a part. Without a receipt I am out of luck. Even providing serial number got me no where. Use caution when puchasing this brand and make certain you are aware of return policies and warranties. (you very likely will need them)
4,"Does what it needs to, and more","I bought this turntable, so that we could convert our records into cds, using a Mac laptops. After downloading Audacity and fiddling around with it for a couple hours, I figured out how it all works. Yea! The downside is that the recording picks up static when the computer is used at the same time for other work, so you can't do two things at once. The good thing is that my husband can also plug it into his computer and external speakers, so that he can just listen to records. It's handy and a space saver, not needing a receiver."
3,Good price,"These are so hard to find almost anywhere, three stars is for the fact that the ink seems to go kind of fast. Love the Dr. Grip pen, but having to keep buy them is way too expensive."
5,blue!!!,"I only like writing in blue but I have a hard time finding Dr. Grip pens that have blue ink. So, I purchased this ink to refill my breast cancer edition Dr. Grip pen. The medium ink is perfect."
5,Dr Grip refills,"These refills are great. The gel pen refills by Dr Grip also fit my Sharper Image Roller Ball pens and I could not find those. So, now that Dr Grip fits them, I am using those pens again and they are beautiful."
3,Great watch except the alarm,"This is a really good looking watch and worked just fine. I bought it for the alarm, though, because I need to do something on the same day at the same time every week. The alarm was only capable of going off once in the next 24 hours and then it had to be set all over again each time I wanted to alarm it. Too much of a pain and I actually sold it on eBay for nearly the same price I paid for it. To get the type of watch/alarm I was looking for, I had to buy one that had an electronic alarm built in."
1,defective crown,Received the watch and set the time and date per instructions.The crown and or stem was defective in that it would not retighten to form a waterproof seal.Returned[excellant return policy]for a full return.Nice looking watch.
5,Stylish Great Watch,This watch was a Christmas gift for someone and it is a nice stylish watch. I was very impressed when I open the box. The watch had a great face. It was easy to read the date and time. The watch is nice and sporty great for everyday wear not heavy at all. A woman can even wear this watch if they are looking for a stylish men's watch...meaning the face of this watch is not too large. I love this watch and so did the person I gave this to.
5,Pulsar Watch,I was very happy about the price and the watch. The only thing I could see is it's a pouplar watch and it took three different trys to buy it.
2,Defective Product,"Product appearance is excellent ... but lumenescence is quite poor. Product performed well for about 7-10 days after receipt ... then ceased to function. Took it to a local jeweler to check batteery ... battery OK.I intended to order a new product. I suspect I received a refurb. When I received my merchandise credit, I noticed the reason shown for my return was ""customer return"".True ... but the real reason was ""defective merchandise"". If statistical quality control is being utilized, then the coding is distorting results."
3,Tate Revenge,Not a bad novel but not written in the best way. Typical plot...Does give good insight to Paris... As you might surmise from the Titlethat is why I bought it. It makes a GREAT coffee table book for me!
1,Thin and fragile.,"I do not recommend these at all. They are very thin and fragile, and the hand-made shapes of the cup gives them more of a ""irregular defect"" look rather than ""hand-made uniqueness"" look. I literally broke one cup by holding it too hard while washing it (thank goodness I wasn't cut!). Also, these are quite small, not what you would expect from something that's called a ""mug"". There are other decent Bormioli items out there, but from this one, stay away."
4,The Oceans,I bought about 5 books at the same time and this is the 3rd book that I have read. It is full of lots of information but I am finding it a little slow to read. Kind of text book reading. None the less full of useful information regarding the Ocean from the beginning of time! I think it is a good building block for someone like myself trying to delve into the Science of the Ocean.
4,Exactly what I was looking for.,Simple keyboard for my Toshiba tablet PC when docked. Keys are light to the touch like a laptop.
2,Factions - Bleh,"Unlike the Prophecies campaign, Factions is like going from pre-sear to Ring of Fire in one step. It just isn't any fun. It's too hard for lower level characters, and the real people in Factions you get in PUGs are for the most part worse than the PUGS in Prophecies. I particularly hate the fact that you can't start a quest then come back to it, but have to start all over. I also dislike the ""stacked"" quests where you have to run around the countryside forever to get one quest done. Overall, I am fed up with Factions and am going back to Tyria and work on getting some titles."
5,Fun!,"I bought this game for my son for christmas. Unfortunately for him he decided to fail English so he has yet to play it.Fortunately for me, i have been playing it and have enjoyed it immensely. It's a lot like WOW or Everquest, except you don't have to pay a subcription."
2,Not as Good as the Original,"Movie sequels always have trouble living up to the original. Factions is the same way. Prophecies was so wonderful that I guess a good expansion was too much to ask. The game is bugged, bugged, bugged. Truly an aweful disappointment. I have trouble thinking of any good things about it. Most people start characters in the origanal game and go to Factions to goof off. Maybe someday they will fix the bugs, but I doubt it."
3,Could do with half the pages,"Although the first few chapters provide a good description of the Velocity Template Language and how to drive it, I found myself progressively flipping pages after that. I also read Harrop's Pro Spring, which was much more information-dense despite being over twice the size of this book.If you are not yet familiar with concepts like MVC, layered application design, Struts, Spring etc: ignore the previous ;-)"
4,Huge fish on this lure,"Personally I bought the 5"" lure despite the recommendation that it was ""too large"". The first night I brought it out I pulled in a nice 29"" Northern Pike. Unfortunately the skin of the lure didn't stand up to the teeth of the fish all that well and it lost the eyes in the fight. Still the movement and look of this lure is the best mimicry of a minnow I've got in my tackle box. I'm sad the only fish I landed tore it up so much, but I'll certainly buy another one before next years trip."
1,Awful!,Bring back Roy Marsden! This guy was terrible. What a shame to ruin a good story with a very bad actor!
4,"Old-fashioned melodrama, with science","The story line is rather overblown and silly--young scientist goes crazy trying to do things on his own, while his colleagues work together (for less money) successfully. Then there's a boy and his dog, times twenty, and a scientific miracle--real footage from work done at the University of California at Berkeley about 70+ years ago.Aside from the medical-curiosity history, documenting efforts to find how how to restart a heart that has stopped (something we take for granted today), this is a compendium of early twentieth century movie clichés, probably aimed at high schoolers of the period. Lots of fun if you're in the mood for something ""camp."""
4,KICK YOUR FEET UP AND LISTEN TO OUT OF THE GRAY,"Even a new artist has to get a listen and Bob Spanburgh has been recording for a long time as a member of many groups and now a solo.Bob writes his own songs and when he plays live he only does his own compositions.He is a artist that lives his music a mix of soft rock,country with a dash of bluegrass,and just check out the artists and the arrangers he has to put this thing together,not just one person can put together arangements like this.This is just another Cd from a talent from New Jersey Originally and made his fame in Pennslyvania.Just listen to his songs they have feeling and heart. His backupartist on this album are the best in the businss.This is a guy who used to bring his guitar to the table to eat with his family I know..I'm his brother Rich Spanburgh"
3,cigar odor,I sometimes smoke cigars in my car. This item got rid of the odor in about 2 days. Left it in the car for about a week. Developed a horrible cough. Took 10 day to stop coughing. Probably should not have left it plugged in for so long. Really scary
1,waste of $$,Wanted this to keep my car smelling ''fresh''. Had it plugged in for a week didn't notice any difference
3,"works, not great, but ok","somewhat cleand the air in my truck, which is a mess, fabreze works better, but plug it in and forget it, definite improvement"
3,I think it helps,"I really didn't know what to expect, but I'm kinda desperate. (Allergies and all) It makes the air smell cleaner. I really think it helps"
5,I love it,Love it! I ordered two--one as a gift and kept one for myself. It works great in my Acura MDX.
3,Better than the first 2 books in the series,"Deadly Décisions is the 3rd Temperance Brennan book. I confess I didn't enjoy the first book in the series that much, found it dragging and a bit slow, thought the second was an improvement, the plot was more interesting, but with this third there is no doubt Kathy Reichs' writing got better! The long scientific blabla is not boring and dull anymore, the story flows much more easily. I hope this tendency will continue and the 4th book will be even better."
1,Save yourself! Spare yourself the time wasted reading this.,"This book was boring for almost the entire 368 pages; I kept checking to see how many more pages I would have to trudge through in order to finish the book. The subject is on outlaw biker gangs and set in Canada. Maybe could be an interesting starting point, but not in this book. The characters don't have much draw and the plot slowly progresses to a mediocore ending. If you want a good book, go read something by Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson or Lisa Gardner."
4,Good mystery novel,"Kathy Reich's character ""Temp,"" is a intelligent, persistent, anthropologist who is involved in solving biker crime mysteries. The chapters always end with page turners and every time you think the characters have nailed a mystery or a suspect the author keeps on tricking you. Reich is a very smart author who is a forsensic antropologist just as her character is. This makes the book all the more interesting becuase you know that the methods they use to solve cases is actual. Read this book if you like complex yet fun mysterys."
2,What a disappointment!,"Kathy Reichs' first book was excellent, her second a good follow-up, but alas not her third. If you are looking for information - on forensics, anthropology, cranial implants and heaven-knows what else - then you'll probably enjoy it. Personally I prefer a good story, and characters I care about. Deadly Décisions has neither. Ms Reich seems to lack the ability to weave information into the plot without the reader feeling he/she is being lectured. Wading through this morass of facts, I convinced myself the book was a slow starter. It wasn't: it was a non-starter, predictable, guessable and utterly putdownable. So if you're thinking of reading Kathy Reichs for the first time, go for Déja Dead or Death du Jour - and give Deadly Decisions a wide berth."
2,A plot driven by long-distance coincidences,"Here's the formula: As Montreal's forensic anthropologist, the narrator encounters a series of grizzly murders - so far, so good. An old friend in the Carolinas just happens to have key information that allows a breakthrough - what luck! A dysfunctional relative from Texas visits as a houseguest, and just happens to have Texas-based ties to the culprits in Montreal. Inevitably, people associated with the perpetrators will physically attack the narrator, but through a lucky break she survives and cracks the case. This is the formula that Reichs uses in both her second and third novels, but it's a very tired and flawed plot structure. She needs to find some way to advance the plot without relying so heavily on a series of cross-national coincidences. This novel, which introduces us to Montreal's cycle-gang subculture, is better than her second, 'Death du Jour,' but still no match for her first novel, 'Deja Dead.'"
2,Waste of Your Time and Money,"Metallica, one of the greatest rock bands of our time, both lyrically and musically. I have always been a diehard Metallica fan, I own all of their albums and love to read about their history and lyrics which is what convinced me to buy this book. However, this was a very uninteresting read to be quite honest. The way the lyrics are described are at many times based on personal opinion and their meanings are no more in depth than you would get on a Metallica site with song meanings such as Encycmet. I'll admit, I learned a handful of cool Metallica facts from this book, but it certaintly does not make up for it's many poor aspects. If you want a good Metallica book, I suggest Metallica Unbound. Nothing Else Matters : The Stories Behind the Biggest Songs, is Poorly written and plain boring. This book just doesn't cut it and it will feel like a chore reading this."
2,Lardo's Folly,"Being a loyal follower of the McNally series, this one makes me miss Mr. Sanders even more. For the first time I struggled through an Archie adventure, not hanging on every word for a clever delivery, but hanging on until I reached the end. The beloved, well developed characters that Mr. Sanders brought to life on the pages of his novels have lost their zest. The chemistry and sizzle between Archie & Connie have fizzled. The Pettibones take a back-seat, as do the Olson's. We can only hope the series continues.....with a different ghost writer or Mr. Lardo tries a little harder to regain the Sanders' touch."
2,"Close, but no cigar.","I will probably continue to purchase and read the McNally series, even though Vincent Lardo is no Lawrence Sanders. This book is amusing in parts, but I think Mr. Lardo must have written it with a copy of ""Bartlett's Quotations"" in one hand because there are more cliches than you can shake a stick at."
3,Good,But not as good as I suspected--it doesn't have as many songs as I would have liked and I would have more enjoyed just hearing the songs from this cd over the radio occasionally.
2,"Plagarism of ""Raw Eating"" by Aterhov","This book is to a large extent a plagarism of a book called ""Raw Eating"", that was written in the 60's by A. T. Hovannessian (Aterhov). Some sections of the book are copied almost word for word. They have added a few ideas of there own but most of their ideas are stolen. However both books are a must read for those with an interest in raw food. The scientific facts in both should be taken with a grain of salt, there is no supportive documentation. Read both books and find out how much of NFL is ripped off from the original."
2,Good Message....Bad Pathway.,"I feel that this book encourages a good thing, the raw vegan diet. I feel though that these men exaggerate truth even lie in some instances. I feel this book is a way for them to profit from their business. I would recommend looking for other authors."
2,"Great cover, bad tone.","This book is not nearly as good as David Wolfe's two other books, ""Sunfood Diet Success System"" or ""Eating for Beauty."" The tone of the book is too harsh and was a bore to read. There are much better raw food books out there."
3,"Great candy, bad price","I had thought I was getting a good deal, thinking that the boxes would be the standard ""candy bar"" size. But sadly all you get is 24 small boxes marked with a retail price of $0.25. So for $9.45 you get $6.00 worth of candy. Sad, very sad..."
5,Bunnies Love It!,"Nothing worse than getting the first harvest of Timothy Hay with sticks so hard they can poke a bunny's eye out. And they don't eat them or like to sit on them either. So this bag of SOFT, PLIABLE, green strands went really fast. I will definitely be buying it again. That it is hand cleaned, selecting only the best edible hay is obvious when the bag arrives and is opened. It smells good and fresh too!"
3,No Viet nam Experience Needed to be successful,"I will never detract from anybody who served our country during those turbulent times self included. The book is interesting as are some of the characters profiled by Stevenson. His research is extremely authentic. I was left with the feeling though that many of these ""succesful"" men would have been just that with or without a Vietnam as a springboard to their success. It actually left me feeling somewhat envious knowing I never had the means to do some of the same....though not necessarily in Southeast Asia."
5,JQ,"Long time listener, first time reviewer. Great CD, Todd has a very interesting voice and the drums are fantastic. Perfect if you just want to kick back and relax. Fascinating musical structure using complex jazz chords, innovative guitar and soulful lyrics."
1,A explosive start that turns into a damp squib!,"I should have listened to the other reviewers of the novella before buying it. The rather promising start of the story quickly turns hollow and flat. I felt that the writer ran out of steam a third of the way through the story. He tied up every loose end too easily. The end is a typically perfect gay fairytale that will appeal to younger readers. In short, this novella is too short, unrealistic, lightweight and left me with the feeling that I had been cheated!"
2,"Pebble doesn't ripple, it sinks","After reading the novel's description online I ordered it. It came in and I was disappointed that it was only 120 pages. It started out alright, and I hoped it would get better, and it started too, but the closer the reader gets to the end, the more cliche, trite, and just awful the book gets.I'm giving it two stars instead of one because while it is awful, I did find myself laughing out loud a couple times and how unrealistic it is.Don't waste your time with this horrible book."
2,pebble should have been left buried,"Upon finishing this novel, I was almost offended at how boring and unbelievable the plot was. I read the entire thing only because I paid 10 bucks for it, and after awhile it became quite humorous. Like the scene where the two leads beat each other up and then end up kissing in the next paragraph. How much more pathetic can it get? And how are people supposed to believe the two characters love each other--by a black eye? I'm not sure what author's purpose was with this book, but it seriously gave me nightmares last night..."
2,Not Helpful,"My lefty son, who can write but has some dexterity issues, found this very awkward to use."
4,Excellent work,"This was my first Cussler book, given to me by a friend of mine to check out. Very quick read and full of twists and turns. Character development is very good and very good details only add to the well thought out and exciting storyline. After reading this one I only hope that my expectations are not too high for the next Cussler book that I read, which not coincidentally is now."
3,just for looks,"This is a good coat if you want a cheap leather coat. I wouldn't expect for this to protect you from anything in the case of a fall on a motorcycle. I'm not even sure of the validity of the leather. Usually leather smells like leather. This smells like some type of composite partial leather. No too bad I guess for the price but don't buy it hoping for any type of protection. I use my carhart for now and I'm going to return this and get a real riding coat and continue using my carhart until then. I should know better than to buy sometheing cheap expecting something expensive so shame on me, but needless to say this should not be used for riding gear."
4,Social dynamics in LA,"This is a little story with lots of layers. It has pace that breaths. No clutter. Powerful observation. The amusing asides open the way for the long somber look at loneliness and isolation. This is a complete tale.Steve, good job! Thanks. Pls write some more."
3,a decent attempt,"a quick read that won't take more than a morning or afternoon. and won't leave you thinking for much longer than that.martin has created some interesting characters, but rather than make them compelling (by delving deeper into their psyches and making them unpredictable) he chooses to explore writing technique. there are several well turned phrases in this short book, but i'd have preferred more insight into the characters.as the author, martin takes the point of view of an omniscient narrator and as such, you never have the feeling that anything that the characters do or think will be a surprise. as a result, i found myself reading to find out where things went vs. really caring.not a bad effort, but not a really meaningful one. i'd wait for the softcover (and cheaper) version."
4,a short and sweet study of society,"The most amazing thing about this novella, which is full of meaning for a materialistic society, is that it is the realistic account of girl with girl problems and girl thoughts, being told by a male author. It's brilliant, truly.I would honestly recommend this book to someone looking for a compelling AND intellectually stimulating read. It'll only take you a couple hours to read, but when you finish you'll find yourself thinking for hours more about the commentary contained in this wonderfully short, emotional story. I doubt it will be what you expect, but it will surely NOT disappoint."
5,Awed,"Someone gave me this book to read because I am a displaced Angeleno and thought I would like a book about L.A. I could make the comments that this book is funny and witty.....everything you would expect someone to say about a book written by Steve Martin...but I want to say something different; if Steve Martin weren't a famous actor, he'd be a famous, well-reknowned writer. Not only is this book a funny, witty and insightful book about a young girl learning about love, it is incredibly well-written in a style that is refreshing, creative and very engaging. I've read a lot of ""serious"" honored-for-their-craft writers and could not get through their books. Martin's, I could not put down. Buy the book and while you are reading it, forget it is written by Martin and see what you think."
1,I wish it was better!,"I am a big fan of Steve Martin, the actor, though found this book very disappointing. I expected something clever and somewhat interesting, but it was neither. I found the story to be extremely generic with very little to offer. The characters were so simple that I pictured cartoon characters in my mind's eye. If your looking for strong character development or even a good story, go elsewhere. I wish it was better."
2,Still waiting,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Steve Martin, as an actor, and as a writer. I am also a teacher of writing, a novelist, and an avid reader. I loved Cruel Shoes. :-) But I think somebody should have told Steve to write his second novella before publishing this first one. The authorial distance is so far on this I feel as if I am looking at his characters (especially Mirabelle) through binoculars. I can find no reason to give a hoot what happens to these characters.I'm not sure why Mr. Martin chose to tell this story from Mirabelle's point of view, but it would have been nice to give her a personality, at least. I'm having a hard time getting through this very thin book, and the extremely self-conscious tone, unfortunately, reminds me of that totally crappy bestseller of several years back, ""The Bridges of Madison County."" Blech.I believe in you, Steve Martin, write in your OWN VOICE! I'm dying to hear it."
2,Just Don't Get It.............,"all the hoopla over this story, that is. It is short but I pushed myself to finish. On every page I was telling myself that certainly this would pick up in the very next paragraph. For me it never clicked. I just don't think it is all that great a story and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. If you want to read it wait until it is available in the library. A much wiser decision than I made."
2,Not for me,"The story itself was okay, but I didn't like how it was written. I'm one of those readers who would prefer to read an actual exchange of words between characters instead of a narrator telling me what they were talking about. This was what had made the book dull to read."
5,Terrific book - especially on audio!,"Don't just read ShopGirl - listen to it!One of the best parts of this book is having it read to you by Steve Martin, himself, who adds his own storytelling-like feel to this bookWhat I enjoyed most about ShopGirl is that it reads like a contemporary storytale - simplistic characters and backdrops, that truly are complicated, once examined closelyYou also gotta love Martin's overly descriptive details - sometimes they can get carried away, but most of them add a fresh sense to the book - it's also, somehow, very easy to relate to a lot of the characters, within this bookOverall, I highly recommend ShopGirl, as it is one of the few books that I have read that has effectively combined the storytale genre, into a contemporary form!"
4,Well written and believable,"Reading this book was like looking into my own life years ago. I am now a twenty-something single mom, but I can vividly see myself in the main character of this book, Mirabelle. Martin's writing skill perfectly captures what a young, naive woman goes through in finding herself. Unlike Mirabelle I went through this self discovery at a much younger age, but the ""stages"" and outcomes were the same. I can only think that Mr. Martin researched his characters thoroughly, for it is hard for me to believe that a man can write such an insightful glimpse into the mind of a wandering young woman. This is a very tender, and at times, innocent story. A very promising debut into the world of fiction. I look forward to another story!"
4,"Light, airy, though surprisingly satisfying","I've long been a Steve Martin fan. So when I saw this wisp of a story in the CD audio collection at the local library, I knew it would be a pleasant respite during my morning commute. I had enough of Iraq and the bailouts. I wasn't disappointed. Now I'm still creeped out with older men preying upon young, clueless girls, but I guess many girls without strong fathers want a father figure. She wants a father and he just wants to give her an allowance and make love as much as possible. I say make love, but that's putting it mildly. I'm trying to keep this PG. The language and the details can be a bit graphic (which of course I didn't mind, but it was odd listening to the CD while pulling into my school to teach - like I was watching prono with kids around). The ending was sweet, if not somewhat contrived. But isn't every novel? Worth the few hours. There's also a bit of the Mean Girl scenario here too at the department store which makes for a funny situation."
4,Shopgirl finds love and herself,"Steve Martin's first foray into fiction is an ever so slight little gem called Shopgirl. Mirabelle is the novella's protagonist, a full-time Shopgirl at Nieman's glove counter and part-time artist. Her two relationships in the story involve young, broke, and dumb Jeremy (who considers their running into each other at a laundromat their second date) and millionaire Ray Porter who is relationally immature in his own ways.In only 130 pages, Martin shows quite an evolution in all major characters and a fabulous stagnation in sex-starved supporting character Lisa. Martin has carefully woven wonderfully humorous insights into each of the characters, making them interesting and likeable, even when they sometimes aren't.I hope this is the first of more fine fiction from a clearly talented man."
1,What a Disapointment,"I found this book to be extremely depressing, and competely misrepresented as a romance. The pros drones on and on and on ... There is no emotional connection to the characters, and no drive to the plot. My advice ... pass this one up."
1,Where's MY book deal?,"All those reviewers giving Shop Girl five stars should get off their knees and read a real book. This isn't a novel, it's a synopsis of a novel. If I changed the title and names of the ""characters"" in this book, and submitted it to Hyperion, do you think they'd publish it? Not a chance."
4,Steve Martin is a gifted writer,"I read this novella a couple of years ago. I pride myself on having selective tastes when it comes to authors, and I found Steve Martin to be an excellent craftsman of words. However, I thought the second half of the novella was significantly inferior to the first. Perhaps he felt rushed to finish, perhaps he was no longer as interested in writing it. Regardless, there was a noticeable difference. He's definitely a consummate writer, but only when he pushes himself towards his best."
4,Wonderful book!,"I just read this book here in the UK and found it to be thought provoking, funny, full of pathos and extremely well written.It is the kind of book that has the reader asking questions about the lives of the characters. Why did Mirabelle, as naive and un-cynical as she is, move to LA? What did she ever hope to find there? How did Mr Ray Porter get to be in his mid-fifties and be so successful yet be so unaware of the effects of his own actions on other people?I finished the book having strong feelings towards all of the characters, glad that they had found the happiness and contentment that they had been searching for.I look forward to Mr Martins other novels!"
2,Dragged myself through this yawn,"I love Steve Martin. But not this book. I found that there was so much distance in the voice of the narrator, very above it all, knowing, and very little warmth. Stiff. Forced myself through it and found myself angry toward the end because the entire experience felt like Steve Martin was memorializing some affair that he'd had in his life. The man seemed very much like how I imagine Steve Martin to be when not ""on""--depressed, childlike in his inability to understand others. Then I started wondering if this book ever would have been published if Steve Martin weren't a celebrity. He's got a platform! Let's publish his book! Hey! He will make sure that a movie is made of it! There are far, far better ways to spend your time than reading this book."
2,"Disappointing, Fell Flat","The Short:It wasn't anything spectacular, or even all that great. If Steve Martin wasn't Steve Martin, I don't think this story would have seen the light of a publishing house.The Long:The writing was...stiff throughout the whole book and came across incredibly dry. There was no real 'voice' but more like something written for a textbook. There was also a distractingly constant feeling that Mr. Martin had received a Word-Of-The-Day calendar and was really excited to put it to use. As far as the story, I found the whole of it underwhelming and even boring. It didn't touch me in any real way, I didn't feel much for the characters, and it didn't make me think about anything in particular. It fell disappointingly flat."
5,EXCELLENT READING,"Not only is this book an easy read, it is very enchanting. Few men, especially celebrity types, know the opposite sex very well. Steve Martin obviously has a handle on this because I felt he gave 100% to the thoughts and feelings of the main character. She was believable. This is one of my favorites, till I finish the Pleasure of My Company...his newest book."
4,A Diversion with Amazing Fights,"For the first twenty minutes of this film you would be forgiven if you didn't understand what was happening or why. In fact, there are huge chunks of the film that where the viewer may become lost in a fog over where the story is going or who the characters are, but that quickly gives way to a sense of awe once Zen starts fighting. From that point on there is no point - only the battle. And the battles are amazing!If you are a fan of martial arts films then you must watch this film just to experience the amazing fights. The final battle on the side of a five story building, with no wires or stuntmen, jumping up and down levels, fighting and then moving onto and off marquees is one of the most amazing sets ever seen in an action film. I found myself growing uneasy as the fight progressed! There is a palatable sense of danger lacking in Western action films.This is a great martial arts film and a nice diversion."
3,WARNING about the BluRay,"Great movie, but the only English subtitles on the BluRay are for hearing-impaired people and have descriptions like ""(men grunting)"" and it's annoying as heck.What were they thinking?Stupid.I'm returning the BluRay even though the picture quality is certainly better and getting the DVD.4 stars for the movie, minus one for the idiotic subtitle decision by the studio."
2,Bad Movie w/ Good Fights,"To put it simply, this movie is what you call a bad movie, it is a few fight scenes away from a 1 star."
2,Martial arts mediocrity,"I bought this movie because it was one of the only I could find on Blu-Ray. Visually the movie is great, but after that disappointment sets in. I thought this movie was going to be similar to Ong-bak the Thai Warrior. I was wrong. The action scenes are ok if you like matrix style wire fighting. If real butt kicking is what you crave then this is NOT the film for you."
2,kind of weird action import from Thailand,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I found this filma little off putting. The story line and action are pretty good but I foundparts of the flick kind of strange. The bad guy in the flick is surroundedby women who appear to be really men. I know it is not PC but that is justnot my thing. I thought it took away a lot from what was otherwise a fairlydecent flick.
4,Interesting and fun comedy drama with good music.,"It Started With Eve is a comedy drama with an original situation, kept interesting by great performances. Charles Laughton is a wealthy old man who demands to meet his son's fiancee from his deathbed. He's expected to expire within hours, but his son (Robert Cummings) can't locate his fiancee, who's gone out with her mother. He wants the old man to die happy, so in an act of desperation he hires a hat check girl (Deanna Durbin) to pose as his fiancee. He introduces her to his father, and everthing seems to go off well - until the next moring, when the old man not only doesn't die, but asks to see the girl again. The deception continues as he makes a speedy recovery. Laughton is great fun to watch, Durbin beautiful to listen to (she sings 3 songs), and Cummings and the rest of the cast provide competent performances to make the movie work. It's not quite as funny as it might have been, but still a treat to watch throughout."
2,outdated,"While the information in here was of some value, I found that other books that I have on this subject are more indepth. The market info was no use because it was very outdated."
1,The Worst Book I've Never Read,"I'd heard a lot about James Patterson, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Sorry I did. I found the characters to be very sterotypical, and the plot unoriginal. I got through about 100 pages before the dialogue totally turned me off. When I pick up a book to read I want to be drawn in by the characters. Instead I was turned off with disgust. This book is designed for the weak minded. Don't waste your time."
1,Dry!,"I will be brief as possible: On every other page there seems to be a murder. (Maybe some of those pages could be used for further charcter developement or latent morality). Secondly, and most important, Patterson, in his novels, always tries so hard to get the reader to question the villians motives; however, once the motive is revealed I can't help but to say, ""Thats it?"" Patterson builds you up as if the reason for committing the crime is going to be some incredible reason that no one has ever considered before, yet makes sense. Nonetheless, once you understand why the crime was committed, you have to double check the cover and make sure your not reading a book in the ""goosebumps"" series."
5,Jack & Jill (Alex Cross),I always enjoy the books that James Patterson writes and especially the Alex Cross series. I enjoy the suspense of the book & the endings that leave you waiting for the next one.
3,Good thriller with many bad guys!,James Patterson can be accused of being hokey and at times his writing certainly is but here in Jack And Jill he writes a compelling mystery with a competent yet flawed lead in Alex Cross. The villains are a serious threat and the mystery is a good one. Overall a good but not great read by one of America's most popular writers.
3,Kindle Version Typos are Too Distracting,"LOVED the book, but as stated in previous reviews, the typos distracting enough to slow your read and bring you out of the story, which is a huge disappointment. If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased a print version."
4,A Wild Ride,"A Multi-layered suspense thriller with many twists and turns, and a surprising conclusion. Although intricate, the plot is not difficult to follow. But it is Alex Cross, the main character, that is the star of this story. We get to know him a little better and I like him more and more with each new installment in this series."
2,How did Jack and Jill get to be a bestseller?,"114 Chapters - get real! This book is poorly written in allaspects - organization, loose ends in the plot, characterdevelopment, unreal dialog, too many unanswered questions.Can't imagine how this feeble effort got to be a bestseller..."
3,A big disappointment.,I surprised myself by actually finishing this book. After reading Along Came A Spider and Kiss The Girls I expected a lot more from this book. Don't bother.
4,Not bad at all,"JACK & JILL is an entertaining little thriller that easily held my interest throughout it's unfolding dual stories of a man/woman duo of celebrity killers and the predator who's brutally murdering school children in Cross' own neighbourhood. There were a couple of unexpected twists along the way, and the book's pacing (many very short chapters) propels you along to a satisfying end."
4,convoluted but good,This is the first book that I have read by Patterson so I can't compare it to his earlier efforts. Thoroughly enjoyed the story but there was too much going on with two separate serial killers investigations. Patterson could have done more with less story to tell ..ie better develop his characters and tie up loose ends. ...worth the time to read it...now I think I'll go back and read his earlier works that the others were saying are even better..
4,Book review & Kindle Touch.,"Just got back into reading on a regular basis. Patterson keeps chapters small, quick, to the point and enables fast reading. Fast paced in action and very easy read. Have now obtained 3 other books, chronologically, in the Alex Cross series. Wish I had started reading again, sooner. Kindle Touch is a God send. Great product with numerous options and alternatives. Have since purchased a Kindle Fire HD for my wife."
2,mediocre story,"As far as murder mystery type stories like this one, I consider Jack and Jill to be well below average. Not unreadablely bad, but just thoroughly mediocre. The killers are not very interesting, and their motivations are never really clear. There is a strange side-plot about a jouvenille killer, which doesn't seem to add much to the story. And then there is Alex Cross, who seems to solve this one on pure luck. Not a very compelling story at all.The audiobook is average or better in terms of production values. The reader is pretty good, and they have some nice variety of voices and sounds etc. But nothing really stood out. Perhaps the cast had trouble getting excited about this dreary story just like the rest of us did."
1,Plot is a giveaway !,"I usually like James Patterson but I figured out ""who done it"" about 1/3 through the book. I hope that James Patterson has not fallen prey to the churn and burn style of some other popular authors. This one seems to read ""my publisher wanted this yesterday"" in between the lines"
5,So good.,"If you like Nag Champa, orange, and being clean you'll love this soap. The fragrance is very light just like the incense."
5,"Fun book, very quick read","Not great literature - However, its hard to put down and I finished it in two and a half evenings. I agree with the guy whose only complaint was that it was too short. If you are planning to cruise or just want to dream a bit, this is a wonderful book. Can't wait to read some of their other ones."
2,Lame,Does not work with Windows 7. There was no notice what type of system config was neccessary for this software. LAME!
4,A great collaboration,"The Mexican Jorge Reyes, having started with a little-recorded Mexican rock band, decided to forge a solo career based on pre-Columbian music, enhanced (occasionally) with studio technology. On this album, he enlists the help of Steve Roach who, once again, proves that whether solo or in collaboration, he is one of the best synthesists in the world.Roach's keyboard electronics and Reyes' multiple native instruments and melodies work so well together that it is a real pleasure to listen to this album. The two also collaborated, along with Suso Saiz, on two albums as a group entitled Suspended Memories, and then again, much more recently, on the album Vine, Bark, Spore.This is a beautiful, haunting set of pieces that should be in anyone's CD library of ethno-ambient music."
5,Powerful!!!!!,"The title track ""El Costumbre"" literally means ""The Custom"". In this case I think it is more of a way to say ""Habitual"" or a ""Ceremonial Habit"". Trying to critique this album is difficult because the expressions in these recordings go beyond words of explanation. You have to listen to really ""get it"". All I can say is that this album is powerful and inspiring(In-Spirit). Jorge Reyes Passed away a few years ago but his contribution to the world of electro shamanic recordings etc has been invaluable to those who ""seek"" a higher awareness through electronic musical medium. Steve Roach is a guest artist on this album as well and The two have collborated on a few other albums that I highly recommend that you download as well, ""Vine,Bark,Spore"" "" Suspended Memories Forgotten Gods"" and "" Suspended Memories Earth Island"".Happy Journeying,NowTraveller"
4,It's a hopper for the A-5,It's a replacement hopper for the A-5. It's gravity fed which is okay since the A-5 has the cyclone feeder mechanism. I got this to mod so I could fit a scope on my A-5.
4,Hard to put down . . .,"This is the first book I have read by James Patterson.I could barely put it down. It was excellent, full of action,suspence, and shocking revelations......Highly Recommended.."
1,Ugh!,"Seriously, I am the only person who does NOT like Patterson's writing. His writing is so simplistic and dull. What's with the italics on random words? I'm sorry, but I find Alex Cross to be a very unbelievable hero. He has no faults, is highly intelligent and handsome and horrible things always happen to him. Possible, yes. Believable, no!Kiss the Girls is an ok book, but overall I didn't enjoy it. I find Patterson's writing style to be very dry and boring. They did turn this into a good movie, though. So skip the book and rent the movie. It is a much more satisfying experience."
1,Disappointed,"The characters were not well devoloped to make me care about them nor what happened to them, the story was dull and evoked no emotion from me and I choked through it to the bitter end all in all not one of his better works, but then nobodys perfect."
5,Casanova was in my room!,The exhilarating pace of this book totally got me hooked from page 1. James Patterson is a master storyteller who made me believe that Casanova could be hiding in my room! After reading this book I was so aware of anything which went bump in the night that it took me quite awhile before I fell asleep. Casanova and the Gentleman Caller is every woman's nightmare. I'm definitely looking foward to his next book so that I can get my next Patterson fix!
4,Good story,Very good story. I love stories about strong women who can overcome anything life throws at them. Very powerful story.
5,Another Great!,"I love Patterson's books! He's a superb psychological thriller writer, with attention to details, while keeping you at the edge of your seat and not wanting to put the book down.Kiss the Girls is a brilliant cat & mouse thriller!"
4,late comer to the party,"Out of pure desperation for new authors, I picked up this book and Along Came A Spider through a used book store. I hadn't seen the movies and I like to read series, especially if I like it.After completing the second book, I do tend to like the character of Alex Cross, but since there are innumerable reviews already posted, I'll only write what I didn't like about it.1) Patterson switches from first to third person constantly which confused me until I got used to it2) The main female protagonists are always seeming to sleep with Alex Cross.That's it.For the most part I enjoyed it. It was a quick read, although a bit formulaic. I'll probably pick up the next in the series but if things seem to stay in the mold, I may stop after that."
5,Good Book,This is a great book the second in the Alex Cross Series and one of James Patterson's finest moments after The Quickie.
2,Plot is pure fantasy,"Although this book held my interest, it was not very believable. Suspense was used throughout the book, but the whole thought of a DC detective and his partner being able to leave their job to work in a foreign jurisdiction is strange. He wouldn't have been given the time of day there. Also, why would a victim be permitted to be placed in danger in stake outs, etc, throughout the latter part of the book?"
5,Mystery,Alex Cross the Great read. You should read the books in order of when they were written. They are always fun and fast moving reads with Alex Cross the supper cop or what ever he is or detective psychoanalyst. If you like a good mystery don't miss the Alex Cross books. This is an early book
3,"Can't put it down, another great one by Patterson!","My second Alex Cross book and definitely not my last. ""Kiss the Girls"" is a story of twinning murderers on oppostie coasts and their wacky and sometimes grotesque ways of toturing their victims. This Patterson novel was riveting and thrilling, but I found the book a little difficult to follow in the beginning, I kept confusing the two murderers! The other characters were good. I really like Alex Cross and his neverending search for someone to love (all the whilst being afraid to lose them). His family's just a little too perfect with the Nana Mama and two kids, but not a big issue. The story line is one surprise after another and just when you think you're safe and sound - out comes the bad guys again. But it definitely didn't end the way I'd hoped (you'll have to read it to find out!)."
3,"Good book. Spends too much time with ""Black History""","Well weaved story. However, I found my time being wasted while the author gave me his views regarding the ""Black Experience"". This is enough for me to avoid buying any more of his books. I am not prejudice but I am not concerned with what happened 150 years ago. The practice of slavery does not happen in America today. Perhaps the author could think of himself as an American rather than a black American."
4,The movie does not do the novel justice,"This book is a masterpiece of human insanity and the need for control. The character of Alex Cross is an attractive young widower who does not need our sympathy. He has two young children but with the help of his grandmother is doing well as a single father. Then you have Kate an ambitious young medical intern who has bad luck with men. Their characters get thrown together when she is kidnapped by the same ""Casanova"" as his favorite niece. The ""Casanova"" is faceless and Patterson's protrayal of him makes you yearn to remove the masks which hide his face. This novel is full of suspense and mystery. Alex Cross is the investigator we all hope we have if something goes wrong,we all hope to be as strong as Kate Mctiernan, and hope we never encounter Casanova. In all the movie ""Kiss the Girls"" didn't even get close to showing the audience the complexity of the human psyche."
3,"Crazy,pscychotic,yet an allright book","It was an ok book,but makes me think what kind of person writes these books."
1,Pathetic - Save yourself the money,"While I was reading this my husband was reading Jack and Jill - our consensus - both awful. We didn't even read each other's book (fortunately we didn't spend money on them - we could just return them to the library). The book's only redeeming feature is that it's fast paced, but the ending was disappointing. This book was beyond R rating for me and R is definitely my limit. We just discovered Richard North Patterson (again we each had one and we thoroughly enjoyed both)."
4,EXCELLENT,I gave it 4 stars and it will be rare when you ever see me give out 5. I liked Along Came a Spider more than Kiss the girls but this was very good. Things become personal for docter/detective alex cross when his neice is kidnapped by the killer/rapist/kidnapper Casanova watching Cross dig too the bottom of this is outstanding.
4,Kiss the Girls was an exceptional book.,"""Kiss the Girls"" was a very well written book by James Patterson. I was very impressed with the entire plot. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat for almost the whole story. I often wondered who could be committing these serious kidnappings. The ending was very hard to determine, and I did not figure it out. I find James Patterson to be a very detailed author, and I will continue to read his mystery novels."
5,Better than Doja,"I read ""Kiss the Girls"" a while ago and it is still my number one fav. book. I really enjoyed his style of writing and the characters and all the different levels he hits within the story. The book keeps you on your toes, and makes you think. The movie was excellent but the book was so much better! I would, and have recomended this book to others; along with some other Patterson novels like ""Jack and Jill""!"
4,A real page turner,"I had this book devoured in 4 days. I couldn't put it down! A great and intriguing storyline, that will keep you guessing until the very end.."
4,probably his best.....in terms of thrill and gruesomeness....,ok i loved this book...its well writeen and the villains are so well presented........but some of the stuffs in the story arent explained.........but none the less the story is so fast paced that u will have no time to breath..........good book...........
1,Tame and lame!,"I was looking for a real adult film. What was I thinking buying this on Amazon.com? Too bad; the women were beautiful. Soft core porn is like making out. It's a start. It should lead to a greater climax. It doesn't...If you like adult movies, this is not for you. Let the buyer beware."
2,Some archives should stay underground,"This one (which is actually two old cassettes, _Age of 369_ and _Chant 2_, with an extra compilation track thrown in for good measure)'s for the Merzbow completists in the audience. Much of the material here was reworked for the _Batztoutai with Memorial Gadgets_ 2LP that came out a couple of years later, and in the state we get it here, it's still unrealized, a chaotic morass of sounds with no real internal cohesion. You're much better off finding a copy of Batztoutai (or the 2CD reissue on RRR called Batztoutai with Material Gadgets, one of Merzbow's best releases to date)."
3,Big Fish,I enjoyed the movie very much. I've wanted to expand my movie collection and found this is a perfect addition.
5,"I like the movie a lot, until I read the book.","Now, correct me if I'm wrong, this movie did originate from the book ""Big Fish"" by Daniel Wallace. Yes, this is a likeable movie, but once you read the book, you'll realize not much is mentioned about Edward Bloom's ring cast into the river to get that catfish. Read the book before you watch the movie if you want to know what ""Big Fish"" is about. I've also noticed the part about conjoined sisters are different. I don't want to ruin it for those who actually do want to see this. The book and movie has the same purpose about the boy wanting to know about his real father, but the stories are totally different from each other."
2,Unappealing Finney,"Sunday, August 15, 2004 / 2 of 5 / Unappealing FinneyWhile I typically love Tim Burton's work, I found Big Fish to be oddly polarizing. Snippets of the life and times of the main character when played by Ewan McGregor are much more enjoyable than watching the bulbous Albert Finney `flounder' about in the present day incarnation. The luminous Jessica Lang languishes in the role of the wife in present day, standing by as a prop while the dispassionately played son tries to synthesize reality and his father's tall tales fed him over the years. An odd film, and not his usual quirky special way, it just didn't work for me."
1,Big Dud,"And you thought Mars Attacks was bad? You ain't seen nothin' yet.What a huge disappointment. It never, excuse the pun, reels you in. The best parts of the movie are the ones without Burton's playful imagery. Tim Burton's films are really starting to annoy me. They are so childish and lack any sort of real substance. They rely solely on the visual aspect, and that gets tiring after awhile. It's like if Tim Burton were a painter then his medium of choice would be crayon. Granted he can do some really good stuff in crayon, but step up and be a man for once. Put away your crayons, and try using some paint."
1,Not Up to the Hype,"After all the wonderful ads, I was really looking forward to this movie. I was disappointed to realize the ads showed the very best parts. Overall, I thought it was lacking in plot, and it centered around the father character, who was not in the least bit likable. The special effects were good, if a little dark and creepy like everything of Tim Burton's, but special effects cannot carry a bad story."
2,So...,"...I guess I don't need to see anymore Tim Burton movies. Funny what a decade can do, huh? Stylistically, I feel like I'm done seeing him rummage through the same ol' bag of tricks, and storytelling-wise, I guess I now realize I was never really impressed. Granted, part of the problem this time isn't his fault. I thought the novel Big Fish was corny and obvious. And I find Ewan McGregor's performance to be way too.... Gumpish... for my tastes. But still, I unfortunately see Big Fish not only as a bad movie but a bad indicator of where Burton is headed as an artist."
2,Good movie but defective DVD,"Working at blockbuster video, I can tell you that roughly 20% of the DVDs or so are defective. They don't look like they have any scratches or anything, but they'll just start skipping about an hour into the movie. I would very very very strongly recommend against buying the DVD, unless you want to deal with returning it until you get a good copy."
2,Underdeveloped dialogue and script,"The dialogue did not support the story or plot. I found it boring and cliched retelling of the father-son who don't understand each other story. I didn't enjoy the movie much, except for the funny bits.I like Tim Burton's work, but found this movie silly.I would not recommend this film very highly. See Last Samurai instead."
1,big letdown.,"Where's the screenplay to this? Dad goes over some pretty annoying eye candy of giants midgets and a huge fish without any real alligorical content and that about it folks, trashy staff. The big promise of some sort of father son relationship forming is again apparently absent.Thumbs down of jessica lange, a great actress I ve see on stage a couple of times who goes completely wasted here (i don't think she mutters anything in excess of a couple of lines frankly) as a cartoon wife character.Tim's aiming to be the next ed wood possibly with this one, but, and I never thought I d say this, ed wood at least had some workable screenplay.Just plain trash."
1,don't listen to them!,"This movie was absolutely terrible. The plot was practiclly non-existent and what little plot there was, was a load of bs. At no point in the movie does his son make any attempt to separate fact from fiction, yet by the end he suddenly has a tremendous love for his father. There is nothing to be learned from this 2 hours ..., and i feel stupid for wasting (money) and 2 hours of my life on it. Don't buy Big Fish."
2,a far-ranging fantasy,"""Big Fish"" is a chick flick about male characters. Many will find this mixture of tall tale and reality, strangely unsatisfying in spite of competent acting performances turned in by Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Ewan McGregor. The women are relegated to very minor roles and their characters are barely fleshed out.The story of Edward Bloom, a ""social person"", and a storyteller who embellishes the truth at every turn. The movie revolves around a series of flashbacks, some believable, others fantastical. Bloom's son struggles to find the real man behind his father's ever-changing smokescreens; he wants to connect with his father while there is still time, before Bloom's terminal illness claims him.""Big Fish"" will doubtless fall into the ""love it or hate it"" category. This reviewer did not find a great deal to love."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I tried watching this, but couldn't get into it. It may be that I was tired the night I started watching it. But, I found it really boring and couldn't keep my eyes open so I turned it off. Eventually I will try watching it again, and maybe change my rating."
4,What a deal!,"I had never purchased used DVD's before, but there is no difference as far as I am concerned. It viewed just fine, I'm very happy, thanks."
3,The ending was ruined,"I enjoyed the movie very much right up until the contrived narrated ending. I was touched by the scene of the son himself finally reconciling with his dying father by helping his father create the father's 'final story'. That was very good and that idea ~could have been~ the 'closer'. The scene of all the people from the father's stories showing up at the funeral to prove they were indeed real was okay but left the film little place to go for an ending.Those people should have shown up visiting the father at the hospital BEFORE the father-son bed side death scene. They could have intereacted with the son and bolstered his enlightenment. After that, with the son telling the 'final story' as his father dies, the script could have broken directly into to a final fantasized ending scene that WAS the son telling his father's last story showing his resting place in the river as a big fish.I was expecting one final 'whopper' like that ... but was given a guppy instead."
5,completely astonishing!!!!!,"I've been a really big Tim Burton fan for a very long time. I love all his movies. Before I hit the theater, I know the movie was going to be a father and son one.....,but a weird one. The imagination of Tim Burton has been captured on film for all his films. The way he makes the movie all dark, and just....amazing at the same time is amazing. He is like one of my favorite director of all time, Better than Spielberg. This is a father and son movie and I would understand if someone cried during the film. I felt like crying. This is like the first really great fairy tale in year's...!!! What surprised me the most is that Rogert Ebert hated this film. As which Richard Roeper liked it. I guess Ebert got a little nuts since Siskels gone. Don't listen to Ebert, listen to Roeper."
2,I Hate To Say It But I Don't Think Much Of Big Fish,"People tell me I missed the point in this one, that it's as much about reconciliation, closure, and understanding as it is about the fantastic tall tales told throughout his life by a now old and moribund man, played by Irish actor Albert Finney, but all I know is this is the only Tim Burton film I have ever disliked. I found Big Fish uninteresting, slow moving to the point of boring, and it didn't seem to have a point. It sounded good from what I heard told about it when it was in theaters, with its giant and enchanted town, its evil old crone who forecasts death, its ""big fish"" and its love story, but when I watched it on DVD I was put off, and I can't quite define why. Big Fish has a good cast and some nice sets and once or twice it almost seemed to find its pace, but it never grabbed me, and that's unique among everything Burton has done. I can't say I'd tell anyone not to see it, but I also haven't been enthusiastic in recommending it, either."
2,A very low-level introduction to j2me,"i would not recommend this book if you are familiar with java (standard and/or enterprise edition). the explanations and examples in this book are very low level. most of the stuff can be also extracted from the javadoc of the api documentation. its pretty useless to copy api specs and javadoc into a book. you just can view this info for free whitout having bought this book...if you are really a beginner, maybe than this book can help you. for me, the level was really too lowlevel."
1,misinformed,"I bought this book to quickly learn j2me. The book does not get to the point. Some of the stuff on networking does not make any sense. The web has everything the book has to offer and MORE. If I were to buy a j2me book, I'd consider another book."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this book to learn how to write animation in VB5. A reasonable assumption from the title. The book not only does not do it, but it doesn't even attempt to do it. What the book should be teaching is hidden in a DLL that accompanies the book. So one learns nothing. Even the DLL is amateurish (it causes GPFs for one thing).As an experienced programmer of 36 years I have read hundreds of computer books. This one is close to the worst one I have ever read. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Ditto's to previous reviews,"This is a VERY ATTRACTIVE book - only on the front & rear covers. That is it's only redeeming value. It shows a high resolution - rendered drawing on the back which made me think I was going to be doing this with this book... NOT! I Wish I had read the other review and the Warning! Warning! Warning! on page xxi before I bought this book!!! You have to set your display to only 256 colors or you'll get a GPF (crash!). The other clue I should have heeded was discovered on page 153. It's a screen image which says, ""...Unregistered Version 1.0 Register to get:- 16 and 24 bit colour depth support..."" This is a cheap shot! I am not going to send him MORE MONEY (whatever 22.50 pounds is). You can get ActiveX controls which support 16 & 24 bit color for free on the internet! The book is too expensive for what you get and I am returning it to the place I bought it from. I'll be happy to stick with my ""Instant VB Animation"" by Michele Leroux..."
1,You never know what lurks behind a pretty bookcover...,"I rate this book 1 Star solely because it is THANKFULLY a very fast read! I received this book as a gift, had never heard of it and naively assumed it was a sweet story about pretty little sprites like Tinkerbell! In reality it is a Victorian era girl's ""diary"" about ""faeries"" who she contends are all the blame for her infered sexual dallinces. I found nothing amusing between the pages- either handwriten or ""pressed""! The hideous drawings of flattened faeries must represent her repulsion of her own sexuality, men and love. That's all I got out of this book! On behalf of all beautiful angelic faced sprites, the only kind that truly exist of course,I not only condemn this book but most certainly would never recommend it for young readers- or anyone of any age for that matter! I suggest using it to stoke up a fire on a cold winter's night!"
5,Stuck on Fairys!!!!,"Your readers have brought a smile to my face while reading the reviews. The Pressed Fairy Book is a delight to all senses of the human nature. What a wonderful place to take yourself for the laughter we so need in our lives. My son knew the need in my life and found a copy of the pressed fairy book last Christmas. He also found a copy of ""Strange Stains & Mysterious Smells"" by Terry Jones & Brian Froud. It's numbers are ISBN 0-684-83206-2 and is a wonderful addition to your collection. The calenders are a daily reminder that we need to laugh much more than we do. Somewhere in the mass confussion of my cataloges I have an address to purchase the 1999 calender. Will locate if your interested.... I to hope to see the book in print again. My daughter needs one."
4,Gellis Lover,"I am a great fan of Roberta Gellis. Of all of her books, I love the Roselynde Chronicles the best. So, I was glad to see another story from that series, although it is not of Alinor's direct family. The hero is the nephew of Simon, Alinor's first husband and the story occurs between ""Roselynde"" and ""Alinor"". Those of you who like the rich historical detail and the authenticity of her stories will be glad to know that Gellis has continued to be true to the period. Those who like ""bodice rippers"" in general will love the story as well."
4,Good,The lunch bag is a excellent product in order to keep the lunch warm (if you take a warm meal) or fresh (if you put a salad o beverage inside)... avoid edor... it's comfortable
2,Knee pads came apart,The helmet is great...but buy it separately. The knee pads are junk. The hard shields came apart from the underpadding at the faux snaps after my son wore them a couple of times. They can't be fixed either wasting our money.
5,Great Southwest Flavor,"Christina has created a great sense of place with the town of ""Almost"", Arizona. Romantic tension, a well executed plot, and above all the memorable characters and quotable dialogue we've come to expect from Christina Skye. Another winner from Skye!"
4,A TRUE LOVE STORY FOR THE NEW MILLENIUM,THIS IS A WONDERFUL ROMANCE. TESS AND TJ ARE THE PERFECT MATCH WITH THEIR STRONG WILLED PERSONALITIES. THERE IS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF DANGER IS THIS BOOK. TJ IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A MAN'S MAN. THIS RUGGED COWBOY THAT COULD BE MEL GIBSON'S TWIN CAN MELT YOUR HEART. IF I HAD TO CHANGE ONE THING IT WOULD BE TO TAKE OUT THE VISIONS THAT TESS HAS ABOUT BEING AN INDIAN MAIDEN MEETING HER LOVER.
4,Who did the packaging??,"I really enjoy the series. But who's idea was it to put the second series special editions in tins?! They are virtually impossible to get the DVD out. The potential for some to crack the disk is too great. And the tins take up twice the space as a normal clam shell dvd box. The makers may think it is cool as a collectable, but I think it is really annoying. Keep with the clam shell covers!"
4,Love Body butter BUT....,"I have ordered Body Butter before and Loved it but this time it was not as thick as the lotion I got before, not sure why. But it smells amazing."
5,Wonderful,This product is fabulous! Why spend money on perfume when this product doubles as a wonderful scent and is healthy for skin.
4,great body butter..,"i am an avid body butter user..for years i purchased tree hut brazilian nut and original body butter (they are less expensive than body shop's version, but just as good even smells better!) i tried this one for the first time and i actually like the texture of it better! it goes on more smoothly, it's lighter, and seems to last all day. the smell is nice but tree hut's version smells way better, that would be my only complaint (if that'a even a ligitiment one!)"
5,Full of magical adventure and surprises,i am a BIG avalon fan and the books always keep me guessing what will happen next to the mages. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and i could not put it down. It's Adriane story so there's plenty of action and mistwolfs and lots of funny moments and Zach and Drake! oops i don't want to spoil it for you but it just keeps getting better. I always say this is my fav avalon book but this time i really mean it.
4,Nice balance between sweet and salty licorice flavor,"I like licorice. That I ordered 5 lbs of the stuff on spec should drive that point home. This is very good--not the best I've ever had, but very close. It's not too sweet, not too soft, not too hard, not too salty, a little chewy--very good, overall, and very reasonably priced. Perhaps if I eat it all I will finally 'od' on licorice and leave it alone for a long while. Update: Did not overdose on licorice. Note to self: never order 5 lbs of any candy again. Note to others: Licorice can raise blood pressure. If you are watching your blood pressure, don't buy 5 lbs. The best licorice I've ever tasted was Lucky something. It's made with beet juice as a sweetener. Tastes wonderful and has perfect texture, but is pricey."
2,too much.,Five pounds is more licorice than anyone could ever eat! The candy seems really hard to chew. I will have to take this to work and see if my co-workers won't eat it for me.
2,Portable DVD,"Item was overpriced by approximate 30%, and battery pack was dented upon arrival. Tried to cancel order before shipment, but website just put me in a loop that never allowed me to enter info. necessary to cancel the order."
2,hunk o junk,I bought a similar polaroid model last year - very temperamental. When I load a dvd it has trouble accessing the disk and will often read 'no disk' when a disk is present.
4,A nice review of recent geological history,"This book was released in 1973, and, even though dated in terms of developments in historical research, would remain a leading text in terms of explaining geological events of the past through mythology. Of particular interest are the last three chapters, which address the multiple legends arising from the great Minoan volcanic eruption at Santorini in about 1500 B.C. In addition, the book explores all manner of other legends, including the Deluge, the Mount Mazama eruption that created Crater Lake, etc.A most refreshing aspect of this book is its scholarship. The author totally avoids the drivel associated with such fiction writers as Whitney Streiber and Erik von Daniken. There is no invocation of imaginary aliens or manifestations of vengeful gods, etc., but only use of narrative from ancient peoples to explain things they could not understand. For that reason, the book is valuable from a historian's perspective. I highly recommend it."
5,good deal,"My store, Food 4 Less, only sells the reason, which is good, but I love the reg. brown bread, so finding this was wonderful. I keep a few in my long term food storage as well since they have a good shelf life,"
4,MapPoint North America 2004,"Of course this program has been constantly updated and the 2010 version is now available.I picked up this program used because it was cheap in order to verify operation of another program called APRSPoint for ham radio operators.MapPoint 2004 installed without any effort at all and came up immediately on my HP laptop running Windows XP Pro. This software interfaced with my Ham program flawlessly. No error messages anywhere.In use, the program seems fairly accurate, however it has a little trouble locating my particular address since I am on an angled street. I have heard from another user that there are some inaccuracies in terms of where addresses get placed on the maps.For general purposes and if you are not requiring major exactitude, this program does indeed work well."
4,Excellent Crossover,"I actually had this album on my hard drive for eighteen months before I really gave it a chance and listened to it in earnest. It is great! It is not just a dubbed up sampling album. There is real creativity here - it reminds me of the KLF, Filter, Moby, Can and many others all wrapped in one tidy package. It is definitely worth the small purchase price, and will play especially well on a nice system.top jimmy"
5,One Hell of a Ride!,"Hunter creates bold, interesting characters that pull the reader through the story like an express train. Dirty White Boys is my favorite of the Hunter novels with Point of Impact being the second. Could not put Dirty White Boys down!"
2,"Stick with ""Swagger"" Novels",I prefer the Swagger novels to this. It was readable but did not give me the same satisfaction as Hunter's other books.
1,the worst thing ever,"this book is the worst thing ever and anyone who thinks otherwise is sad. Attempting to regain the time I spent reading it I lied to a friend and said oh this is really good you must read it. He read it and said oh you are a bad man. the opening description of Lamar Pie and his physical prowess was a warning I did not heed, oh woe. the characters are so bad, for instance Bud Pewtie oh. James Ellroy said that this book was good and that it hummed with the rhythm of blue grass and it does not.So many authors have taken the detective genre and written amazing novels- James Ellroy's American Tabloid is a fine example and to be fair maybe they tricked him. I do not know why this was published. But if you read this review order the book. If you all read it my revenge will be complete."
4,Rollicking Read!,"Not of the caliber of Point of Impact, but still a rollicking read. Typical Stephen Hunter and worth reading. Probably closer to a 3 and 1/2 star to be concise."
2,No Redeeming Qualities About This Book,"This book is about disgusting people. Even the ""good guys"" are disgusting. Extremely violent, every other word is a profanity. I should have guessed it was going to be bad from the title, but I felt like I needed to read it if I was going to review it. I love thrillers and action books, but this was just too gross for me. I read ""Point of Impact"", which I enjoyed, but because of this book, I probably won't read any more of Stephen Hunter."
4,Good thriller about some mean okies.,"These boys are nothing but bad and when they get out of the Oklahoma slammer they go on a last rampage. The are street smart and prison smart but should never be on the loose. A smart cop finds them the hard way after they have done some hard damage to the Oklahoma population. The author has a couple of good twists on criminal motivation. The excitement stays through the end of the story. Overall it is quick reading, entertaining and doesn't require a lot of concentration"
4,"not painful, just challenging","An all-around solid work, and one of Akita's earliest indications that he wouldn't be content with the same old harsh assault with each release. Quite varied works, with more of a focus on textures and strange rhythms than on previous releases. While it's not entirely laid-back or subdued, Merzbow displays a much different form of aural hostility here. Lots of creepy ambient passages, glowing feedback, metallic rattling, and other sounds that never succumb to boring white-noise scuzz. Maybe a bit Asmus Tietchins influenced, in a way? Production isn't as crystal clear as some other releases but don't let that bother you. Highly recommended if you're just getting introduced to experimental music in general, or if you think all Merzbow does is ""make harsh noise."""
4,Great reading for mental health providers,I am in mental health and could not put the book down. Great reading on what goes on on the other side of the fence for those with severe/chronic mental illness and ends with hope that even the most severe can lead productive lives with the right treatment and meds
2,watching paint dry,"i understand where she is coming from, but it was a bit dry. my review is a little under average, but its my opinion. cant change it."
5,Really fun!,"For anyone who lives in Milwaukee or has connections there, this is a great book. The photos are top-notch and I learned a lot about the city from the interesting explanations. My only disappointment was that the Allen Bradley clock tower wasn't in there. Maybe, being built in the early 60s, it didn't qualify as old enough, but it IS the world's largest 4-sided clock (with faces twice the size of Big Ben) and quite a landmark. So 4 1/2 stars if I could :)"
5,Great stuff.,"This brought a tear to my eye as I looked at the first few pages. I loved it as a kid, and now I have it in hardback forever. I plan on reading this to my kids on days off before they go to bed to them."
2,'round in circles,So much duplication and jumping around! The story is compelling but the book tells it a hundred times in small passages then jumps to the court case. I had to put it down after getting half way through.
4,Good for our purposes,"I don't like cutting on it--too noisy and sounds like we're going to break the glass--but we use it to protect a small counter area next to the fridge. It's very useful for setting cold things right out of the fridge on. We have marble countertops and have to treat them with caution. Note that it is not perfectly transparent so you don't really see the beauty of your counter through it, but you do protect it. The board is inexpensive and durable if you treat it right."
1,Foot pad fell off after first use.,"Foot pad fell off after the first time I used it. Otherwise it's fine, minus the fact it wobbles every time I use it."
5,It Took Me Into Another World!,"This tape was not like other relaxation tapes, at least for me. When I listened to it, I was put into such a state of awareness that the exercises in visualization made me cry. You may think that sounds crazy, and I guess it is. But, the ""world"" that it put me into is one that felt real enough to touch. So, I would recommend this tape to anyone, as crazy as this review may sound. Get the tape. As a spirit on this Earth, you need it."
4,Meskada,"This film shows a small town's residents will go to any length, each in their own ways, to help the town thrive again after it's been pretty much destroyed by economy and Corporate America. They go about things in different ways, families are affected in one way or another here - but it all comes down to survival and sticking together whether out of friendship, blood or their common goal. Nick Stahl plays a Law Officer who grew up in this town, left it - but returns to because of a crime he's investigating proves to have ties to the town. At times you wonder which will win - his loyalty to that town or the loyalty to the badge he wears and what is right. I think his character thinks the same! All acting was pretty good - I saw a couple actors do roles unlike they usually play and were very good with their portrayals."
4,good phone,"This is a good phone with all the basic features. However, it does not have any WAP browser. Also, Verizon & Nokia lock the Nokia PC Suites that you cannot upload ringtones using DKU-5 cable. However, an easy trick to get around it is to rename your .mid to some other extension and you can upload the ringtone the Gallery. Other than some stupid money making scheme and the lack of WAP browser, I recommend this phone."
3,Not the best of his books,I have many of this authors childrens books and this is not the best of them. I love many of the others which prompted me to buy this one
1,Comic book style is awful. Very disappointed!,I didn't realize this book was written like a comic. I loved the other CSI books that were written in the traditional style. The comic style is so much harder to read. I am truly disappointed in this purchase.
5,Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes and More,"While doing some research I ran across this type of rhyme and did a quick Amazon search for it. I found this little treasure chock full of them. Being older and wiser in the ways of the world, I may have grown a bit cynical and these rhymes flat out tickled me. Some were shocking, if taken literally, but maybe thoughts that have passed through our minds at times. Many surprising ones too. This is a great collection of rhymes of this type and I was thrilled to find this book. Have added it to my collection and highly recommend this book."
3,OK as a secondary reference,"As we're not talking about an expensive book, it's OK to buy it as long as you include the Haynes Repair Manual (Jeep Grand Cherokee 1993-2000) in your cart as your primary Choice.Chilton's tries to cover way to many models of different cars and fails miserably in some aspects. Haynes, in the other hand, deals with Grand Cherokees only, making it much more accurate for ZJs (all the info applicable) and WJs (some info applicable) owners. In case you don't know ZJ stands for Grand Cherokees manufactured between 93 and 98 and WJ stands for Grands made in 99 and after."
3,OK for general service - not so good for real problems,The book is very generic and spends a lot of time trying to cover all models and then fails in some cases. It is OK for general maintenance but I find it lacking in detail for real troubleshooting. The real detail needed for a specific model is not sufficient or sometimes totally absent. Considering the price (fairly inexpensive) of the manual it is probably still good value for money.
2,Spanish,"I am enjoing to read the guide, but the English the author used is little hard for me, like high level words, no just dayly ones.Of course I prefer in my own lenguage, I mean Spanish.Thank you.Luis Javier Martínez Torres"
5,Quality Product,Very satisfied with this product. It gave me an increase in power and fuel economy to my 2008 Dodge 4.7 L Magnum engine. I really like the sound too. Next upgrade will be a performance chip. Everything fits perfect except I had to drill the hole for the oxygen sensor. They showed a drill location mark in the instructions but I could not find it. Download the instructional movie to really make installation a breeze.
4,Funny interpretation of current legal attitudes affecting fairytales.,A great read and funny interpretation on how current legal attitudes would affect fairy tales...
5,Great Book,"I just wanted a copy of this book, used would have been fine. But, I was so pleased to get a new copy of this book for my library. The value is much more than I paid for it! The book arrived in perfect condition and within the stated time of arrival. Will order from this vendor again!"
3,good,nice book......great summer resource book. my child did half the book herself then need a little help with the first problems. of course she is in the first grade.
1,FIremagic Grills,I bought a Firmagic Grill almost 14 years ago thinking this is such a great product. Now I know better. Even though they make a grillt that lasts a long time. They do not stock parts for the grill that lasts a long time. I am stuck with a grill that I can not put a cover on it as thay do not make and do not stock the the metel clips that hold the cover down. I would not reccomend this manufacturer if you want a grill that you can get parts for long term. Now my grill will just get worse and worse due the manufacter not stocking parts long term.
2,underwhelming,"Saw this at a yard sale, looked interesting, picked it up. Unfortunately not a good book; trite, predictable, kind of mundane. Unfortunately, it felt like a waste of time. Cannot believe the author actually reviewed herself here. That's just tacky."
4,Satisfied with service.............,I had ordered a product that was shown online and received a different product which was returned and refunded.
1,too small for 9 year-old,These were too small to fit my 9 year-old son. The youth size range states up to 14 but I can't imagine the youth size fitting a child over 7.
1,SUCKS.,"I bought this for my 10 year old brother. he has very small bones and legs, very skinny. The knee pad did not fit, way to small, he complained that it hurted too.the elbow pad was a bit small and uncomfortable, VERY CHEAP material as well. Seems like i could get this at a dollar store.save yourself time and just look for a different knee and elbow pad.LOVE the shipping though. Came a day early! :)"
5,Skateboard,I purchased two of these skateboards for my grandsons for Christmas and was extremely pleased with how fast they shipped. (one the box the broke and the skateboard with scratched so they could be wrapped or shipped in a heavier box) But we were very pleased with the quality of the product. The boys can't wait for the snow to go and spring to come so they can use them.
3,Cute concept but not life sized enough,"Although the concept of slices of bread that can be pulled apart because they are magnetically held together is nice, the execution was mediocre. Specifically, if the toast slices were life sized I would have given this item the full five stars. The quality is good as to be expected from Haba and the material is soft velour. I don't know if I would purchase this again."
1,wrong part was received,"The original Ford part is 19.75"" long, and Monroe's website lists the specs for 901260 Escort wagon tailgate as 19.75""extended length, the one I received (with 901260 ink-stamped on it) looked very different on one end and measured 22.25"" long. I had ordered another one from a local parts store, and that one was about 21"" long----absolutely pathetic quality control by Monroe---not only does the part not fit the only application it is designed for, and not only does it not match their own specifications, they couldn't even make the two of them the SAME wrong size !!!P.S. (4 months later): now that I look at Amazon's photo of the part, I recognize the goofy-looking end in the right side of the photo that was on each of the WRONG parts that I received."
5,Great Background Music,"Not the kind of music you sit and just listen to- it's a music that compliments you doing something- course that goes for pretty much all technoesque music. It fits in perfectly if you're the type of person that has a multidisk CD changer that uses ""random"". And it's great background music for conversations, or for when you're playing Quake 3. It's a terrific soundtrack from a terrific movie- If you saw the movie, and loved it- you'll probably like the soundtrack- Goes with your personality."
2,we're a generation raised by women.....,not only were the pixies left off but let's not forget tom waits was left out too....there's only so long you can listen to this c.d. before it all sounds the same.too bad...the movie is amazing and the score is really effective in context.
2,Disappointing Industrial Ambient Track,"I have a rule that I NEVER buy soundtracks because the music contained on them is often disjointed. This is because a movie has several different scenes all requiring diferent moods of music. When you play them all continuously, and in the foreground and not the background, what seemed to be really good tunes can't stand by itself.Fight Club was a great movie, and the music in the movie was also very good. But the CD is very disjointed, some of the songs fail to flow well and completely change in mid-stream. There ARE some good tunes on the CD that are best listened to individually, but as a whole the CD just feels like a disjointed collection of industrial ambient.Looks like I should stay away from soundtracks- but see the movie!"
4,Very Good !,"So, let me see if I understood it right : People buy the album to get the Pixies song. When they find out the song is not in the soundtrack, they give a very low rate to the CD. Why in the hell they do this ? If they didn't bother to check the track listing and bought something they don't like, they can't make a fair review. But they get really mad and make the CD pay for their mistakes. Come on, go buy a Pixies compilation (BTW, I love the Pixies, too) and shut up. The CD is very good. The Dust Brothers proove they are great not only producting. Don't let the bad critics written by those airheads confuse you..."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I found this CD to be a big disappointment. The movie rocked, but this score, by itself, doesn't."
4,Decent Book,I think that the book was really good and gave me a couple of new ways to think. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking to examine how they think.
1,Ridiculous Fluff,"I had to buy this text for use in my Humanities 101: Critical Thinking course... Horrible. The whole book is pretentious fluff by some goofballs who think they know how to ""improve thinking habits"", among other things. I didn't take away anything useful from this book."
1,Are you joking?,"Nothing new here, all I've seen in the low reviews is dead on. For a book to tout a one-stop-fits-all is beyond absurd. The only reason I gave this book a one is there are no zero's to chose.Do yourself a favor, steer clear. The authors espouse being objective in our thinking, to open our paradigm to new experiences, and then start the longest subjective diatribe I've ever had to endure.Maybe this works for the authors, but I categorizing every human being into tiny compartmental entities and then obviously leave out the tenets of all major psychological and ethical works since Aristotle, is unexcuseable.This was a total waste of time."
2,Critical Thinking,I gave this a 2 stars because it not a page turner. Read this if you need something for insomnia. Keep it on your nightstand.
5,Excellent for an A700 - BUT......,"As much as I love this bag and I do. It was only up until they cracked my windows in my car to rob this out of my footwell, that I decided the next bag, needs to be not so obvious. Heck if I saw it, I would want it too. Great bag, but buy a Kata, that looks like a backpack and is easy to carry insteadPrevious Kata 30-n-1 bag review: Wow, after they stole my sone camera bag with my gear from my car, I decided I wanted to find something that did not even resemble a camera bag and this is it and I love it. I did switch to the 30 size, since it was a little bigger, but both are relatively small. They both look like a backpack and no one would know you have a camera inside. I usually bring it on vacation or events and simply swing it to open it, while carrying extra things in the top, such as my wallet, phone, etc.. Just Awesome! and beyond cool looking, quality is top notch, as well!"
1,useless.,"It's good only if you need to memorize words, one-liner questions and sentences from English to Azeri. You will be taught how to ask questions in Azeri, that's all. For the answer to that, you're on your own. The CD is PC-based and too much attention was given to the graphical user interface rather than the content."
3,Crazy Price,Its ok just not at the crazy price it is listed here for it is wayyyyy old btw! Get a newer model for half the price.
3,Linda Walters,I try to keep a open mind when I read a book by a new author. I saw the reviews of her other books and decided to give her book a try. I was kinda disappointed with wishy washy female in this book. She really was workin my nerves. I'll have to check and read another book by Walters before I write this author completely off.
2,not very good quality and UGLY colors...don't be fooled!,"I only wanted it because it looks pretty in the picture. but the case is actually a dark maroon, and the tools are hot pink or brownish pink. Oh well. If the colors dont matter, its a pretty cheap set of screwdrivers and it looks like you can at least use the hammer, although the hammer has some weird scratchy black paint around the head..."
1,CHEAP!!!,"I received the first kit and returned it due to the way the entire thing looked. The tools looked as if they had been used, plus, the tools were very cheap looking. Some of the tools were hot pink, some were a lighter shade of pink. Some of the tools didn't even open like the scissors and some others. The second tool kit I received was basically the same deal. It was just extremely cheap looking and some of the items in the kit didn't even work. There was no way I could present this item as a gift, and that was the entire reason for the purchase. Not worth the money at all. Don't waste your money on this item......Seriously."
2,try fridge farm instead,"My biggest complaint is that the pictures aren't simple enought for the average fridge player to figure out. My son never played with this - instead opting for the Fridge Farm, which is alot more fun (whether he gets it right or wrong). I kind of think it was a waste of money for our family."
2,Great until they added Stevia,"As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes. I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach. However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes ""Stevia"". Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product. The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and ""messed with"" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness. It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products."
1,product has changed for the worse,"The product you sent was not the one shown. Apparently it has changed - much for the worse. The product number is the same, but the container and incredients have changed. Worst of all, the taste is now awful."
3,Good product,"Cytomax is a good recovery drink that doesn't have as much sugar as Gatorade. I like the fact that it reduces the lactic acid build up. I ran the San Francisco marathon and they gave out Cytomax. After the marathon, I was not as sore as I usually am the day after. I think it was due to the Cytomax. The bottled form is better than the powdered form. The tropical fruit flavor taste like punch."
2,New formula might be crap.,"I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan."
5,Does what it says.,I do like this stuff during rides and post for recovery. I'm a little bummed they switched up the formula as you now have to use twice as much powder to make the same 24oz. bottle and the price stayed the same. How does that work?
4,Works great,Tis is good tasting and easy on the stomach. It gives me enough fuel to get thru a grueling 1 or 2 hr workout while training for ironman triatholong.
1,"tastes awful, bring back the old formula","I have been drinking the former formula for years and I loved it. Now the new stuff tastes like crap. I ordered 4 large containers and will return all of them, it is the worst tasting stuff ever. Bring back the old formula."
1,I hate stevia!!!!,"Hate!!! the new cytomax with stevia. If I wanted weird sweeteners like stevia, I could buy Hammer products, which I also despise. You have lost my business cytomax, and I'm really bummed because you had one of the few products that didn't upset my stomach."
2,Not an improvement,"I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars."
3,Ehh...,"I'm a big fan of Philippa Gregory's books, I have most of them in my library. But, this book seems a bit of a slapdash effort. The plot plods along and is repetitive...if I were married to someone who reminded ME every 12 seconds that she was a Princess of Spain I'd want a divorce, too!Ms. Gregory gets a lot of grief from Historians (capital H) for her other books taking liberties with the lives of historical figures but I don't begrudge that...if I'm being honest with myself I think I read these kind of historical novels to feel more intellectual than if I read books with Fabio and his ilk on the cover. But, having said that, this book feels totally contrary to almost all accepted fact about Katherine of Aragon. That may be by Ms. Gregory's design, but I found it more glaring and harder to get past than her playing fast and loose with Ann Boylen's life in ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" I can hear the Team Boleyn faction saying, ""See, we told you so."""
3,An alternate portrait of Catherine of Aragon,"I enjoyed this novelistic treatment of Catherine of Aragon precisely because it is so different from the usual treatment of her.It is an easy read that left me wondering 'what if' some of the conjecture is true? This Catherine does not appeal to me as such as some of the more traditional portrayals, but the possibilities introduced by Ms Gregory do.I liked it, and recommend it as a light read."
2,Save Your Money,"This book was totally unblievable. The dialogue was a clumsy attrmpt to fill in the history of the period. Much of the book was repetitious, and it did not make sense to me. The last quarter of the story turnes from character study to tales of war. The book was a large disapointment."
3,Disappointing historical fiction,"While I am mostly a fan of the romance genre, I knew that this is a work of historical fiction and not a romance. That being said, this book was a disappointment. I did not like ANY of the characters which makes it difficult to read. A large portion of this book is written in the first person (from the perspective of Catalina/Katherine) and I would have expected to really understand and empathize with that character. I did not. Katherine, her father Ferdinand, Henry VII and Henry VIII all were portrayed as self centered and self promoting to the core. There was also a lot of repetition and Katherine's attempts to be a warrior queen like her mother just didn't seem believable. I did learn a little about the history of the time and about life in the monarchy which appeared very depressing. While I have not given up on this author or the historical fiction genre, it will be awhile before I pick up a book like this again."
4,Sets up the series,"This book is of course not as good as The Other Boleyn Girl, but I am glad I read it because it set up the rest of the series of Gregory's books about Henry's wives. Not sure I would love it on it's own, but it was good in the context of the other books. PS, if you are just beginning to read Philipa Gregory, you can go to her website and she tells you the order of books. I did that, and have enjoyed reading them ""in order.""From a history teacher's perspective, it is pretty good. I mean, obviously, this is fiction, but it follows the basic history and makes it a lot more fun than my kid's history books! But do keep in mind that these books are not for girls under 16. There are a few references to ""adult situations."""
4,What happened to the end?,"Knowing absolutely nothing about the history, I was able to enjoy this book without being put off by the apparent historical inaccuracies. My main problem with the book is that it seems the entire end of the book is cut off. We go into great detail about Katherine's life for many years, we see her relationship with Arthur, her relationship with Henry, we share her sorrow when she loses her babies. The main part of the book ends with Katherine being pregnant (we assume with Mary), but we don't get to experience her joy of finally having a child. The relationship between Katherine and Henry goes from being amicable (and him being an apologetic cheater) to years ahead when he's leaving her for good, with no explanation as to how we got there. How did Katherine fall out of favor? Why did Henry reconcile with Anne after sending her away from court? There's a huge gap at the end, almost as if they ran out of budget and had to cut some pages, so they just took a bunch out."
3,"Long awaited, and yet, disappointing","Overall, I've loved Ms. Gregory's work, but I was sorely disappointed in this. This could have been a perfect book - except. The liberties taken with history were too much to overlook, and if you read much historical fiction, eventually they become so overwhelming as to pull you out of the fiction magic. Henry the 7th saying, perhaps we can all live contentedly without war as ""People of the Book,"" Muslims, Jews, and Christians? A lovely 21st century thought, but certainly not 15th century. I wanted to like this book. I really did. I will go pull some Margaret George or Sharon Kay Penman off of the shelf instead."
5,Gregory does it again!,"Every book of Gregory's that I read always keeps me entertained and wanting for more! When I finish one, I cannot wait to pick up the next. Great book."
3,The never ending story,I have read several books of this author and so far this is the most hard to read. For some reason the author decided to write the thoughts of the main character additional to the story. I ended up skipping entire pages. It got too boring.
3,"Too much for younger kids, too simple for older kids.","This was a pretty good book - I almost gave it 4 stars. The book has some useful info and the advice is sound (based on other 1st aid books I've read), so I don't think it would be a waste of anyone's money. The stated reading level is 9-12 but I felt it was a little too ambitious for most kids under 12 and too simple for kids over 12. I read this book to my 7 year old and most of it was over her head and had too many ""steps"". MY 12 year old also read it and she too thought there were too many ""steps"" in the instructions on what to do in an emergency. The sections in each chapter called ""GET HELP!"" were confusing to both kids. If you're looking for a Safety/1st Aid book for someone under 12 I would highly recommend ""The Safety Book for Active Kids"" (also sold by Amazon). If the reader is someone over 12 then a Red Cross First Aid Course and an adult first aid manual might be a better use of your money."
5,"No question, 5 stars!","Like most reviewers, no question 5 stars. When I have had a long night at work I already have this cd in my car and the track who sends me on my way. To this day I have never had a song that puts a smile and leaves the smile on my face like the cut who does. This is the first cd I have purchased that I can honestly say I like every track on it."
3,Better resources available,"This is a classic study guide on Romans. Much better resources are now available today. Check out, for example, the commentaries by Osborne in IVP New Testament Commentary Series and Moo in NIV Application Commentary Series. Tom Wright has also written two volumes on Romans in his Paul for Everyone series."
4,every page makes it harder for you to breathe.,"Mine, by Robert McCammon, is hecka exciting and full of thrills to get you on the edge of your bed. You'll hecka grip your book as Laura Clayborne fights to get her baby back from a psyshopath named Marry Terrell aka Mary Terror. The fight is not going to stop until ........."
5,A book for the most adventurous!!!!!!!,This was the greatest book of ALL time! It was something the readercould really get into. Written in a way you can actually feel theway the characters do! Ive read it over and over and once you readit you will to!
3,Do not read while pregnant!,"I am hot and cold on this book...I love McCammon's work, ie Swan Song and The Wolf's Hour, but this one was, for lack of a better descriptive term, OK. However, like the review title says- I read it while I was pregnant, and this book gets seriously creepy in parts! It's not a bad book, just not his best. But, it is worth the read, if only to see his descriptive prowess of Mary Terrell/Terror."
1,Lamentable,"McCammon has managed to make his protagonist, Laura Clayburne, even more detestable than his villain, Mary Terrell. McCammon telegraphs his punches: for a book promoted as a ""thriller,"" this book offers precious few surprises along the way."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"The political talk show characters were interesting.The manifestation of the zombies was painfully dull to watch.First they establish the zombies can't speak, then they have one talk to a news camera. They also start with the zombies killing someone, then say all they want is to vote. Maybe the zombies don't all have the same goals, I dunno. I thought it was insulting to soldiers to say they'd all be opposed to the president, but the movie does address that the soldiers that have risen from the dead are the minority of those who died, the rest are at peace because they died for a cause they believed in. Overall, I dunno, it was kinda boring."
1,The Great Quote,"""We're losing on the facts! Let's make a movie!""- Ann Coulter on how liberals address important issues.For further ""told you so"" comments, see her books."
1,My Jaw Dropped...,"...in a bad way. This movie is astoundingly bad. The message it delivers is so ineptly handled with unfunny humor and bald-faced hatred that it fails as propaganda. It is not funny, so it fails as satire. And because it tries so desperately to be satire and propaganda, it fails as horror.Clearly, the people involved in this sad project hate conservatives--which is fine. Many people do. But not many artists do to a degree that blinds their aesthetic judgments (Tim Robbins can churn out excellent parody, for example). The script seems like it was written by an angry co-ed. I came to this movie expecting to be entertained with some tongue-in-cheek horror. Instead, I was hectored by adolescents."
3,"One Zombie, One Vote...","HOMECOMING is a decent piece of political, anti-war satire. Of course, this was handled far more expertly in Bob Clark's early 70's classic, DEATHDREAM. By comparison, this modern (Iraq instead of Vietnam) version seems somewhat heavy-handed, hitting us over the head w/ it's message w/ the subtlety of a pile-driver! In HOMECOMING, Joe Dante ups the ante, w/ hordes of soldier-zombies (unlike DEATHDREAM's single return visitor), rising from their flag-draped coffins in order to vote! Yikes! While I did enjoy this film, I would have liked it more if it hadn't been so blatant and preachy!..."
3,The Lone Republican Who Enjoyed This...,"...even though I am a Bush supporter, I also happen to dig Dale Bailey's fiction (this is based on his short story). This episode was hilarious! The Ann Coulter and Cheney impersonations were fun.This is obviously tongue-in-cheek and I completely disagree with the antiwar message, but still, it was fun to watch. That is one of the many beauties of this great country-- the freedom to make films that trash people who don't agree with you.Dante is no George A Romero, but managed to direct a ""subversive"" film that is original, but totally lacks suspense. This is a dark comedy, and anyone who thinks this film will persuade people to be anti-GOP, is an idiot. You will come out of this with the same political views you had before (but will never see Ann Coulter in the same light-- bless her soul).Overall, a fun show."
5,Loved It...................,"People need to get a life and sense of humor,this was a creative and goofy horror movie.Loved It 100%Does have a good message though.If your a republican please stay away from this movie it is not for you unless you have a sense of humor."
1,JUST AWFUL!!!,"When i first put this on, i thought ""ok cool its a zombie film"". After watching it, i gave the dvd away in disgust. Basically, dead U.S soldiers come back from the dead to vote out the current government for sending them off to war. This attempt to mix horror with extreme political views is dreadful, and i think it is quite disrespectful to any U.S soldier who died fighting in Iraq for a cause that they believed in. This movie makes out that EVERY soldier killed in battle felt that they were lied to and decieved into going off to war to protect their country from a threat that wasn't real in the first place.Save your money or buy something else, because this absolute [...]!"
5,Love this oil!!!,"I love this product! Used it for years, originally bought it at my spa where I worked, it's great for massage and also for after shaving for sensitive skin. It moisturizes and takes the sting away."
4,Good Guide,The Michelin guide in my opinion is always the best for the area visited. This guide however gives Michelin a run for their money. On many occasions it was better with more complete descriptions of places we were visiting. While not as extensive as Michelin the areas it covered it convered well
2,So - So,Very pretty photos which give you a good idea of Provence but instead of so many photos I wish there were more listings of hotels and restaurants. I found the information a little too spare and bought a different guide book instead.
2,Ehhh...,Tyler Perry is either a hit or a miss. This movie was very dry and hard to keep watching. Very predictable and not very funny overall. I would say find a bootleg because this doesnt deserve anyones money.
3,Not MY Favorite,"I love Madea movies, but this one moved very SLOW! It did have a good message and it was funny."
2,Boring!,I really like Tyler Perry and was very disappointed in this moving. Sorry to say I fell asleep half way through
4,Madea's Back At It,I just love Tyler Perry's Madea movies! They're hilarious but always have an important story line behind the jokes. Must See!
4,love it,"as usual, it is educational as well as entertaining. It focusses on what is right and wrong. Its message of stereotype and family matters is of interest. I will watch it again."
2,NOT FUNNY!,"I kept waiting for the mob to come after the family but it never happened. So in my opinion, putting them in Witness Protection seemed like a complete waste of time! Not a funny move and definitely one of Tyler Perry's worst scripts. It's like he literally sat down and wrote it in a couple of hours simply to have a film to release. It was hard enough watching the DVD. I can't imagine sitting through it in a theater!"
5,Madea's Witness Protection,Another great production from Tyler. You will enjoy the fun and humor of this movie. The character Madea is so funny.
2,Was disappointed for the first time watching Madea,the whole show was phoned in in my opinion... don't know if Tyler Perry's getting tired of Madea or what but it was barely worth watching... I also love Doris Roberts and believe me anyone could have played the part she had in this movie...it was to the point of being boring.... you grew to hate the teenage girl in it and wanted Madea to straighten her out Madea style but again it was disappointing.. she simply told the girl her father was dead with some weird off the wall story and then added her step mom was dead too and even her little brother was gone... the girl cried and the family came in the door and wa la the girl was changed for ever into a good girl...... sucked.
2,?,"Whoever wrote/directed/produced this is not the same person that did the play ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" Period. The entire movie seemed like it was made for someone who had problems with focusing and at times it seemed to fantastic, like ""Alice in Wonderland."" I want my money back..."
4,Funny,This is one of TP's best; funnier than some of the others that go unnecessarily too far with the profanity.
1,I Want My Money Back,"I Love and support anyone that caters to the black community including Tyler Perry. I enjoy 95% of all his films, but this film I can not support. It must be his family member stating this is his best work yet;I wholeheartedly feel this is worst work.The editing alone is horrible, I thought the plot would be decent from the previews, but the way it was projected onto film lost my interest from the beginning. I only watched, hoping it would get better and it never happened. Sorry brother Tyler, ya got me once, now I will wait to read other peoples previews before I buy another ticket."
5,Great Movie,This movie was great to watch. All Tyler movies are awesome except that Aunt Bam's House!! I enjoyed this one and it was great!
2,Madea's Witness Protection,"Typical TP movie where he portrays four differnt characters in the movie. Plot was determined from opening scene, newer faces (no Mr. Brown and he should be in all the TP movies)Won't win an Oscar but served the purpose of filling in for mindless viewing on a rainy day"
2,I enjoyed the movie,But rating amazon movies low. The 24 hour allowance does not make sense to me. Things happen and you cannot go back and really enjoy it.
3,Just okay...,"The premise, as in all Madea-centered films, is silly but it just isn't as funny as the others featuring Tyler Perry's character."
5,I love Tyler Perry as Madea,"I love this movie and all the Madea movies because Madea is over the top, but she says what everyone wants to say without any hesitation. A part of Madea wants to be this good virtuous person, but that is overriden by her temper and her nerves. This movie shows Madea in a different way than the others and that's what made it so nice. I do hope Tyler Perry does alot of movies with Madea in the future. I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that. If you loved the previous movies, I think you'll love this one. Give it a shot! I don't think you'll regret it."
2,LOVE Tyler Perry and Medea,"But Tyler could just as easily have phoned this in. This film doesn't begin to compare with his previous Medea movies and you can tell Perry was not even trying with this one, but was just cashing in on the Medea character."
2,Money Make,It seems Tyler Perry is just out to make money with his usual Madea films without putting much effort into it. I had my grand nieces over and I couldn't focus on the movie and I thought I missed out so I watched it again when they left and I found out it was better with all the distractions.
5,The True Adventures Of A Woman Traveling Alone In Turkey,"The lovely and talented Joei Carlton Hossack relates her travels in Turkey. How does a woman summon the courage to travel alone to the four corners of the earth? JCH tells all in this the fourth of her personal-travel books. Joei is certainly a role model for the woman of today. She has enough energy for four people, enough curiosity for a litter of kittens, and more courage than the fabled Light Brigade. I notice that her writing, always interesting, has also acquired more depth, insight, and humor. I'm looking forward to book number five."
2,Lacks Quality,"The button on the swivel just broke off for no apparent reason after less that a month, causing my cell phone to fall to the ground. Fortunately, my phone was not damaged. However the belt clip was useless without the button that slids into it."
5,The Alan Turing Enigma,"The Alan Turing Enigma : Excellent biography, beautifully written by Andrew Hodges. One of the best biographies I have ever read."
2,Excruciatingly Detailed,"This biography on Alan Turing would have been so much better if the author had just thrown out about half the excruciatingly detailed descriptions of every single thing that happened in young Turing's life.The first 100 pages and he's not even out of college yet. Boring and a little bit pointless. I'd like to recommend the book, but I'm only about half-way through and find myself skipping entire pages - I mean, who really wants to read all those letters he wrote to home when he was at boarding school? It's a little like reading the shopping list of a famous person - no matter how interesting that person may have been, it's just not that interesting to read about the mundane details of his or her life.For a really great biography on another enigmatic scientist, try ""Tesla - Man Out of Time"" by Margaret Cheney. Now, that's the way to write a biography."
1,Tedium,"With so many good reviews (5 stars), somebody doesn't know what makes a good book. Maybe its me, but I was so disappointed in this book. If you think this is going to be a great story about the wizards of bletchley park, keep shopping. Its not. Its page after page (600 +) of nails across the chalkboard tedium."
2,Found several incorrect answers,"I like how straight forward the lessons are but does at times seem to lack definition when it comes to math formulas. Not to mention several incorrect math answers.Example would be on page 771 (Data and Probability) Exercise two-Part A-question 2- it Asks, ""How many calories are in 2.5 cups of brown rice?"". On the chart listed on the previous page, it has a list of foods whose nutrional value is listed by one cup. The brown rice has calories of 667 for one cup and carbohydrates as 140. The answer givin by this book is: ""350"" calories. Actually, 350, is the answer for 2 1/2 cups of Carbohydrates. I found wrong answers givin multitude of times in this book. I was willing to overlook one maybe two...but not consistant as it is.Very poor job on the publisher for allowing this. This book can't be totally trusted in it's lessons."
1,The Writers of the Kaplan GED Book Love the Preview of This Book-Just the way it is!,"If the authors wish to communicate how effective a book is, why not show SOMETHING relevant to a prospective buyer, like a glimpse of its methodology or content? This preview shows only how to install a CD. Makes one wonder how effective the authors were in creating the rest of its content.In fact, the relevancy not found in the preview makes me think the authors are not too confident in their ""epic."" Sadly, it might have some good content. We may never know.Motivated by this preview, I went directly to preview the Kaplan GED book, which, surprisingly, delivers content and methods--and does it without showing how to install a CD! Who knew?To see how very much this one lacks, check out Kaplan's preview."
2,Pass and buy another,"This book has ok pictures but not that many drink recipes. Get another book that has more substance and less ""style,"" because there simply aren't that many exciting drinks in here. If you don't know how to make a screwdriver without a recipe, I suggest you get a life."
3,For the beginner,"Pretty basic stuff. If you do not know anything about databases and have never conducted any analysis buy this book. Otherwise do not bother. I was a little disappointed that it did not provide more detail on many of the algorithms - rather it just pointed out different things that data mining can do (though very well explained). While it providing a nice overview, it did not really strike me as anything groundshaking. It does, however, have has a nice listing of vendors. I would refer to the Berry and Linoff book ""Mastering Data Mining"" for a slightly more thorough treatment."
2,Many case examples that wind up saying nothing new.,"There are many new stressors on today's teens, including being the first generation being reared in a completely postmodern culture. Unfortunately, the author misses this and other more subtle cultural changes that impact today's adolescents in a big way. I recommend Elkind's ""All Grown Up and No Place to Go"" for a more thorough critique of how society shapes and complicates the teenage years."
5,Excelente,"Si al igual que yo, necesitas usar PowerPiont u otro software para realizar presentaciones, esto es para ti. El funcionamiento es bastante simple: no es nada más que un teclado con 3 teclas (PgUp, PgDn, b) con un alcance de hasta 50ft, con un puntero laser integrado. Basta conectarlo al puerto USB y funciona (no requiere de drivers). Ya no es necesario quedarse o volver al teclado, o pedir que te muestren la diapositiva siguiente."
3,Yet Another Messiah Recording,"Here we have another recording of Handel's Oratorio Messiah.This recording uses the Watkins Shaw Edition of this work.William Boughton and the English Symphony Orchestra and the Saint Michaels Singers, and the soloists deliver a fairly decentperformace. I only have a few quibbles with this recording. First the baritone Gavin Carr finds it necessary in the recitative ""Thus Saith the Lord of Hosts"" to sing the word ""shake"" over accenting the ""k"" in ""shake"" I personally find it a little annoying on repeated listening. The Saint Michaels Singers do an okay job with the choruses, but I prefer a slightly larger chorus for this work. The rest of the soloistsmanage their parts reasonably well. As recordings of Messiah go this is an Fair to Good one, not a great one, but better than many others I have heard over the years, just not one of the really great ones."
3,Surprisingly sweet new carols but not the 16 songs listed,"This import ""Roger Whittaker Christmas Album"" features sweet and gentle new carols written and performed by Mr. Whittaker and a back-up choir--exactly those featured on the RCA Victor cd of the same name (for $9.98). I had ordered this Import because of the track listing that cites 16 songs including Auld Lang Syne, Petit Papa Noel, Guten Abend Gute Nacht and other songs not often recorded. The Editorial Review just below the track listing, however, designates ""12 Tracks including: Hallelujah It's Christmas!"" and others. The Editorial Review statement is correct.What you do get on this cd is a collection of original Christmas songs, mostly dramatic storytelling balads and tunes very suitable for children and family listening. The arrangements are enjoyable but Mr. Whittaker doesn't use the full weight or range of his voice as he does so beautifully in ROGER WHITTAKER: THE CHRISTMAS SONG, a cd of traditional carols and songs."
1,Not worth the money,"Wish I would have bought ""Mrs. Miracle"" or something else. I thought it would be a cute story, but found it full of language and crude humor, not a good movie for my Christmas collection. I got rid of it."
1,This label has SPOILED the original sound !,"This label has spoiled the original sound of the B-3 organ, with distorsion, high sound level, and poor digital transfer, that obscure the organ sound.If you want to listen to the same live recording, please buy the cd ""JIMMY SMITH - OFF THE TOP - UK IMPORT VERSION"", where you can enjoy ""keep on comin"" in his wonderful fidelity digital transfer !!!! Believe it !!!!!"
1,Not worth your time,"This compass will not stick to any flat surface. The suction cup is very poorly designed. Just as a test, I tried to have it stick to a clean flat glass tabletop (with the compass in an upright position) - it immediately fell over. I could not find a surface where the suction cup would stay fixed.>> Do Not Buy <<"
3,"too fine, almost cannot feel anything","It does not perform well as a scrub. The exfoliators are way too fine, at times I wonder whether there are even any exfoliators at all.Give it 3-stars because it performs well as a cleanser and does not break me out at all. But if you are looking for a scrub, there are much better products out there."
5,Lee Ritenour - Banded Together,I am one of those with this on the original vinyl. I loved it then and love it even more now for not having heard it in so long. There is not a bad song on the entire disc and well worth a listen!
4,I love this classic game,The over all quality is good. It looks very nice setting on our coffee table. It is a little loud when playing due to the no cloth playing surface.
5,Excellent documentary,"I recently purchased the Madacy tin box set ""Lighthouses of America"" and I while I was delighted by the audio/visual presentation I found it somewhat lacking in actual information. I instantly fell in love with this set by PBS, which is more geared towards presenting facts but still offers an audio/visual presentation every bit as powerful as that offered in the Madacy set. I cannot recommend this set highly enough. If you are passionate about lighthouses then I can guarantee you will be satisfied with this set. The price here is a bit steep - I got mine from [...]"
2,Not for photographers.,"If you are expecting great insight into the lives of National Geographic's photographers or even revelations about what makes great photography then look elsewhere. This video greatly disappointed me as it is nothing more than promotional drivel. So fawning and servile is the narration that each sentence sounds as if it is about to collapse under the weight of the compliments for the organization. It reminds me of these terrible ""the making of..."" TV programs the have now to promote movies. It should be given free with subscriptions and not charged for. It is short and shallow and holds about 15 minutes in total interest for any photographer. Buy the magazine or one of their books instead."
5,One of the best books out there,I bought this book many years ago when we firt came out with it and I have to say it is the best training book I have ever used. When we got a new pup and I saw it had been updated I had to get it. Its still a great way to train you dog
4,Touchy Corners All Around,"The tables were a bit of a challenge to assemble, but the finished product is a lovely, sturdy end table. You'll certainly need the right tools to reach into the corners and tighten the bolts. Thank goodness for the little ratchet set I bought years ago!"
3,Winsome Table,I choose this rating because the table has a one board on the top that does not match the rest of table.
3,"Great, but","This is a great phone.It has lots of memory for regularly dialed phone numbers, if you are interested in that sort of thing, an extra line for your fax machine, a large number display for outgoing and incoming numbers, excellent volume control and a speaker, just in case you need hands free conversations.There's one problem, though. The liquid crystal display gave up the ghost within two years of purchase--not a very good track record.In order to replace it, I'll either have to foot the expense of shipping, labor and parts, or spring for a new phone.Not what I had in mind after spending upwards of $70 in the first place for a name I thought stood for lasting quality."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Half the time it doesn't even turn on, and no, not ""finally,"" there are no DS cheats on this pointless rubbish. Your better off paying 20 bucks for the GBA gameshark and holding out for a DS gameshark. and what's the point of using this on Pokemon games anyway, even if you have infinite rare candies, they still wont obey you till you get the prospective badges. And no, they do not have very many games and the only new games they make codes for are the ones that have pre-existing ones, like pokemon."
3,In for repairs after only 10 days,"I used this game for only 10 days when is stsrted gliching and freezing up. I sent it back to the company 10 days ago, and haven't heard a thing from them."
4,Got what I wanted...,This was my first download of a movie and even though I have a slow DSL line it went very well... I am not so clear on how I got it to run and couldn't recall how to find it for a second watch maybe I need a coach lol
2,Hmmmmm,"This isn't Tech N9ne it's Tech 9, it's techno, it didn't sound bad but it is not Tech N9ne and for having the same name only spelled different then I give it only 2 stars. If I wasn't such a technohead it probably would recieve only 1 star for making sales off a name. If you look at what other cds people bought who purchased this cd it appears as though most people who bought this cd thought it was the rapper Tech N9ne but it's not. mmfcl"
1,KNIVES RUST AFTER USE,"This set bears no resemblance to anything made under the fabled Sabatier name in France. It is low quality, slag goods made in China. The block was splintered and a piece of junk. The knives themselves developed rust spots after a few uses. The greatest value is the stainless steel tool holder and plastic-style tools. All-in-all, pass this one up."
3,"Great deal, but...","The purpose of these knife sets from sabatier is to give you a good knife at a cheap price. The French models are a much higher quality than the Chinese models, but be prepared to spend $150-$300 for one knife. I think it's a great deal for the frugal family. Many of my friends own these knives they seem ok to me.However, if you are a serious cook.I definitely recomend a french model sabatier. I own a chefs set and they are wicked. And hey. If Mario Batali likes em, I LOVE em!!"
1,Not worth it.,Save your $40 and buy plastic utensils until you can afford a better quality set of knives.
4,Great Deal,It is funny what people expect for $30.00. This set is an amazing deal. Mine just came in the mail today and I couldn't believe what I got for the Money. The utensils alone are worth the $30.00 and the knife set has every knife imaginable. It IS WORTH the money and then some.
3,Cleaver broke after two months of use,"I bought this set because of the price. I knew it was not a quality set of knifes. But I couldn't believe the cleaver would break that early. The handle is not attaching to the tang firmly after two months of regular use. I have used it to chop whole fryers. But this is what a cleaver suppose to do, right? Anyway, I have a hard time to find the customer service number of Sabatier. They don't even have a US web site right now. There is no address of phone number on or inside the box. I have to contact Amazon to get their phone number. I am still waiting for the replacement cleaver from them."
1,THEY SUCK!!!!!,the knive are nice but they RUST what's up with that.Biggest peice of crap I have ever bought!
2,Sabatier Precision Knives don't live up to Sabatier's reput.,"These knives are unfortunately darkening Sabatier's good name. I have been using Sabatier knives for years and love them. The precision knives however come un-sharpened - even the serrated ones - and the only way you'll put up with them is if you have never tried a good knife before. The knife block has a nail in the bottom that scratched my counter. BAD choice of knives and knife block!The tool set and measuring cups are good, but not quite worth $39.99 alone."
4,Bargain for the price,I received these knives about 2 months ago and have had no problems. The knives are sharp and the extras are nice a great starter set. The wooden block looks nice as well. I would buy this set again.
2,Not the bargain you think...,"I am usually very forgiving when it comes to bargain merchandise. However, this set is really cheap. The wood block is made of two pieces glued together, and mine came crooked. The knife handles are not very ergonomic. The plastic accessories, the clincher on the deal for me, are fine but the handles are very short. All in all, while I'd like to return the set I don't feel justified in returning it for what I paid (heavy sigh). And I haven't even USED them yet! Let's hope they don't turn to rust in the dishwasher. We shall see..."
4,Outstanding for the price,These knives are a great buy for the price. They are not the top of the line but are good quality as long as they are properly cared for. You can do just about anything with this set and it is rare to find a cleaver in a set unless you want to spend hundereds of dollars on an expensive set. I find them perfect and for an extremely cheap price you couldn't find a better deal. I liked them so much I purchased an additional set for my sister in-law and her husband for christmas. They are a great starter set and a good up grade from your standard low priced models. I would recommend this set to anyone willing to spend $60-100 on a good quality knife set and would like to save a little. Just remember to take good care of them.
4,Nicely designed,"Our 2-year-old boy loves this book. It's not an incredible story (just kittens having a meal), but the cut-out design makes each page almost 3-D and fun to look at."
4,Change of Heart,A very good Christian movie considering the low budget and era. Some beautiful Austrailian scenery. It was definelty worth adding to my Christian video library. The main messages is how Christ changes us through His love.
5,A Treasure!!,Finding this cd was like finding a treasure!The music is like medicine for the soul.Very inspiring! Heavenly music!!Beautiful voices!
5,"Spare, Intense, Gorgeous",You will hear Cuba and Brazil in this recording with a dash of Argentina (a tango?). Baca's voice is ravishing and filled with longing. A must for fans of accoustic Latin music and great female vocalists.
1,Difficult dialogue,"The dialogue used by the characters in this novel was difficult to read. I got 1/3 of the way through and had to stop. It was almost incomprehensible. I am sure it is historically accurate but when I constantly have to stop and translate, it takes the fun out of the story. I also felt that there were too many mentions of urination and defecation by the characters. It is not entertaining to constantly be told about the urinary and bowel habits of the characters."
5,Polio and it's repurcussions 50 years later,"I purchased this item as a present for an elderly woman who was a childhood victim of polio.....she has an unbelieveable attitude and could be a mentor to just about anyone....kind of like the Dalai Lama, only female. This book has been a boon to her.........in helping her understand some of those questions she could not find answers, even through her physicians, she has helped her sons, daughters and grand children know a little more of what kind of internal fortitude it takes to keep one's chin up while dealing with this disease. I recommend this for anyone associated with this terrible but little known disease."
5,Great purchase!,"I bought this costume for my 3 yr old daughter and she just loves it...and so do I! Compared to what I could get at other stores, this is an awesome purchase. The quality of the costume is really good and I was impressed at how complete it was for such a reasonable price. I would buy it all over again."
3,Costume came messed up,I was excited when my daughters costume came as early as it did but the cape did not close..the velcro that was put in did not attach together because it was made wrong instead of one side to be soft and the other side to be the side with teeth both side were soft so it does not clothes I had to purchase a new velcro and attach it myself because returning this would have just been an inconvienance for me.
3,batgirl costume,decent costume but i would order a size larger than you need. the small was super short on my size 6x girl.
5,Seiko Review,Very pleased with the watch. I like not having to worry about replacing a battery and it keeps accurate time.
4,Very Decent Set,"I am not a gourmet cook. I have no need for anything real fancy but I wanted a good Knife set. This one is perfect for the average user. It contains all the necessary knives needed for everyday cooking. The mincer thing is slightly lame. Everything sticks to it and you have to keep wiping the food down to get it minced. My press'n'chop works better for that purpose. Aside from that one tool the rest of the set is great. They are all nice and sharp and the wood black is nice looking. Another good quality is that the blades run through the handle. This is very important, as I've had a large knife break free from it's handle before and I almost cut myself.I reccommend this set!"
1,"Cheap, all-around. OK Starter Set.","For 19.99 this is an ""OK"" starter set of knives. The blades are all serrated so you don't have to worry about sharpening them. They are EXTREMELY sharp. The set looks amazing out of the box. HOWEVER, after washing the knives only one time, the black handles are fading badly. The once pure black handles are now a faded, and ""used"" looking black. The blades on 4 of the larger knives are rusting BADLY. They look horrendous after only one wash in the dishwasher. It's obvious that the grade of Stainless Steel they are using is extremely poor. It's a shame because at a glance these look like fantastic knives. Heavy duty, thick blades, full tang, beautiful block, etc... I would save my $20 and go elsewhere. Unless you want to take a shot at hand washing and hand drying them every time you use them."
1,Practically useless.,"Unless you have a genuine desire to become fluent in Thai this book is useless, especially without the CDs or an actual Thai teacher. If on the other hand you are just going to Thailand for vacation or perhaps to teach English, I highly recommend the Lonely Planet Thai phrasebook - it is much easier to use and has much more practical information."
3,impression and judgment,"I know little bit about this book due to the fact that i have had no time to realy start it.I have gone through a few pages and and so far am very interested in it. It gives a lot of information and has a lot of practice pages.After i fully go through it I plan on correcting my review to better help futer buyers. What i can say now for sure is Auther Benjawan Poomsan Becker, is amazing. I have a few of his books now. He knows Thai, Thai people and Thailand. So going off of his other books, I assume this will be another one of his fine works and will help you and me learn the basics of Thai.All my review is a first impression of the book and judgment of the auther."
4,BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK,"This is a great Thai language course. Easy to follow and great audio sound on the Cd's. I've found the best way to use Thai for Beginners was to make flash cards. I went through the book in about 6 months, but I'm a very lazy student. After completing this book, I could small talk in Thai with the greatest of ease. Though, I could not have an in depth conversation. Which is why the course is called Thai for Beginners and not Fluent Thai.The only major problem is that this course is very boring. Unless you enjoy spending hours memorizing vocabulary, you will probably find this course a bore. But Thai for Beginners Software (sold separately) might help with some of that boredom.All and all, no other course gives the learner as much information for such a cheap and affordable price. Best course on the market for under $50.00."
3,"This game is not woth 1,000 + dollars..","This is a great game, but anyone selling it over 1000 dollars is either dumb or stupid. You can purchase this much cheaper other places on the web. I even found a copy of this at a chain store that sells older games for like 20 bucks, which is still high in my opinion. LET THE BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Do not recommend,"The quality of the shirt is very exciting; the stitches were well done, the fabric comfortable and soft. Unfortunately, though, after only a single wash (cold water) and hanging it to dry, it still shrunk up close to 2"". After only wearing it twice, it is no longer comfortable, and I've donated all of those I bought for somebody who is shorter and wider that I am.I do not recommend the shirts at all, and am very sorry I spent the money to buy them."
1,Awful,"I did not read the entire book, but I got a good idea of how it is laid out by reading sections of it. The book spends a lot of time discussing the quadratic equation. The derivation of the equation is in an Appendix at the back of the book. This, I decided, would be a good place to start. What I saw has to be the most non-intuitive possible proof. There is no motive, no explanation for why things are done the way they are. This is a shame because there is a simple intuitive derivation. I came up with the formula when I was 14 after learning how to factor second order equations. No, I am no genius, not by a long shot. Anybody who is sufficiently nerdy could do the same.After this initial disappointment I glanced at other sections of the book. I found nothing that would provide insight for the non-mathematician."
1,Should Be Called Carbwrong!,"A case of these lemon bars was included in my order, though I did not order them, I suppose to give it a try. Oh god, please don't order these. They are flavorless with an unpleasant aftertaste. The texture is gummy and get stuck up in your gums in a most unpleasant way. No lemon flavor at all. Mine are in the trash where they belong."
2,Not a favorite,"This flavor just didn't do it for me. At the first bite it was fine, but then there was an aftertaste and a feeling. I was reminded of Windex as it sort of dried out my mouth with the lemon flavor. I probably can eat the one bar I have of this flavor, but I won't be buying any lemon ones in the future"
2,Bars arrived degraded by heat,"These bars are very good and normally I would have given the bars five stars. However, I ordered these in the summer and they were shipped from Pheonix. You can imagine how they arrived here, having been exposed to such high levels of heat and being melted; the chocolate coating was no longer brown, but a light tan color with a lousy consistency. They still tasted good, just not as good as when the bars are undamaged. The Doctor's CarbRite Bars are my favorite protein bars."
1,The worst low carb bar ever,"I regret disregarding previous buyer's reviews... The taste is AWFUL; the texture is AWFUL; and the ton of sugar alcohols make it so disgustingly, overly sweet and bloat you like crazy! They should just stop selling this product!"
3,music for spinning,This music CD is for spinners who already know a routine. It is not instructional but the music is motivating and changing up what you do on the spinning bike to the music works for a good workout.
4,Nylabone is a good brand- nice to get a 'multi-pack',"I'm stocking up on things for a puppy (to get this spring), and found these. My last dog (that died one week ago today) loved them, and she never chewed on my stuff since she had enough of her own things to gnaw on. I'm not sure about the edible one- will do more research (puppy needs to be 6 months or older for the edible chew). The 'bones' are all made in the USA per the package, so that is good. :)"
5,Puppy Loves This,"My puppy loves this and this is the perfect thing to distract her from biting us. Her sharp little teeth have not yet been able to penetrate them and they look like they will last a long time. However, the edible bone in the packet lasted less than an hour and I was a little concerned that it was too much for her to ingest and ended up taking it away and letting her play with it a little at a time."
5,great!,my puppy loved these! she is an extreme chewer so they didn't last too long (I think she was on a mission to not stop until they were destroyed) but they lasted a lot longer than any other brand I have bought.
1,plastic chew,Puppy didn't care for this. Older dog chews on it. Not sure how much gets chewed up and digested. Not too crazy about this.
2,The Psalms of David,"I looked forward to receiving The Psalms of David. Unfortunately it was very disappointing and I sent it back. Although the artwork was nice, it detracted from the words and the text was difficult to read. Letters were modified and scattered all over the page with little continuity. The page samples available were limited and incomplete. I would not recommend this book."
4,"A wonderful gift item, a beautiful book","My husband and I came across this book several years ago. It is filled with wonderful illustrations, and beautifully scripted wording. We have given this book several times as a gift, and it is always received warmly. It's a great book to read to focus on the Psalms, and also enjoyable as a poetry volume. Highly recommended."
5,Excited to give this as a birthday gift!,"We have an 11 year old boy who typically hates to read, but since discovering the SGT FROG series that's all he's wanted to do! He has a couple volumes, but not in order, so I'm trying to fill in the gaps for him. I've tried many outlets to find them, & so far Amazon has had the best prices around! Anything to get him to read is great for me!"
3,Monster Truck DVD,"I bought this dvd because it had a lower price than the ones at the actual monster truck shoe we went to. I was surprised by the length of the show. It is pretty long and great for long car trips. I guess I was looking for a vide with more cohesive racing/show. This video is short clips of various races in both the U.S. and other countries. It breaks out the clips by different things the trucks do. Like crashing, mud racing, water racing and more crashing. It is great for kids I guess, but I could do with out the disjointed segments. Also most of it was shot before the digital age so the video is very graining and 80's looking. I'm now looking for a more modern version of this video with clearer images and less cheesy special effects."
5,Toddlers will love this.,"The name says it all. This is a dvd of a whole heck of a lot of monster trucks. No talking heads, no nothing to distract from the point. To a toddler, this is nirvana. Since we got this for our two year old son, I'm rating this a complete success. Just be aware that, to adult eyes, this dvd is going to be of questionable visual quality, and REALLY monotonous. The good news is it's not unbearably long. If you have a young one that adores all things vehicular, they will love this video. We have another set that had WAY too many talking heads. Toddlers don't care what the talking heads have to say, they want to watch TRUCKS. With this dvd, they get to."
3,received dvd finally. kids love it. but it freezes!,"Finally got the dvd. It freezes but the kids love it and all the other monster truck movies. I would never take them to a real monster truck show, but the movies will do."
2,"Should be entitled ""The Rantings of Hoff""","I was first introduced to the Tao through Hoff's ""The Tao of Pooh"". It opened my eyes to a world that I did not know existed. My disappointment in ""The Te of Piglet"" was equally great. I expected a treatise that dealt with Te in the same manner Hoff dealt with Tao. Instead I found it to be not much more than a personal platform from which Hoff could vent his anger and frustrations. As a scientist, I found many of his remarks to be insulting. Scientists are not out to merely catalog and pigeon-hole the world into a set of neat facts, but to understand the universe as an integrated, harmonious system. Hoff's condemnation of everything he personally does not like is not very much in keeping with the Taoist philosophy of ""accept everything, reject nothing""."
3,Too Political,"While I enjoyed the Tao of Pooh immensely, I felt that this second book was a bit of a let-down. If the author would have concentrated on the philosophical aspects alone, I could have enjoyed the book. As is, however, I think it would be just as simple to pick up some Green Party propaganda to get the same message. What a shame to debase such an inspirational topic."
3,Could've been better,"I first read the Tao of Pooh in college and many of the ideas had a direct and lasting impact in my life. Finally, I picked up the Te of Piglet, only to find that as insightful as it tried to be the author has some serious hang ups. There were some very serious misinterpretations in this book that I consider dangerous. Mr. Hoff confuses lesbianism and feminism with man-hating, something many lesbians and feminist do not subscribe to. If you can ignore some of the sweeping mis-statements, there is something of value to be found in these pages."
1,"Loved Te of Pooh, Hated This","Benjamin Hoff used this as a soap box to rant about nuclear power, political correctness, 1990s education and even microwave ovens! These issues did not resonate as timeless and were tedious to someone hoping for more on Tao philosophy. I did finish it, and there was a sprinkling of Toa even in the last pages. Don't know that I would have kept reading if I hadn't been stuck in a hotel in Arlington on a very cold January day!"
2,A poor sequel to Tao of Pooh,"""The Tao of Pooh"" was a charming and insightful little book, and bears (pardon the pun) multiple readings. ""The Te of Piglet,"" unfortunately, is a huge disappointment by comparison. It doesn't stand well on its own and doesn't add much to the philosophy presented in the first book. ""Tao of Pooh"" was overall positive and gently humorous. ""Te of Piglet"" is negative, preachy and mocking. It seems to be mostly a collection of rants about how messed up Western life is, compared to the (apparently) enlightened Chinese. Unless you're heavily into Taoism, don't spend your money on this one."
2,Frustratingly poor control,"This may be the best out there for Motorcycle racing, but it really is very poor. Graphics are ok, but the actual control and physics of the game is just poor! Nothing else to say except, not worth the shipping cost. Not at all like real Motorcycle response."
1,dry and dreadful,"It's no wonder that people look at me strangely when I explain a great love of history to them. It's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student. If this book were more widely circulated, the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced. I have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make it so boring that I would literally fall asleep reading it."
2,Worst Simpsons Soundtrack. Ever!,"A very disappointing purchase. Not what you'd expect from a Simpsons soundtrack. No dialogue clips, none of the vocals from the movie (no Greenday, no Homer singing ""Spider-Pig"", no Springfield Theme Song from the closing credits). With all respect to Hans Zimmer who wrote a wonderful soundtrack for the movie, its not something I want to sit around and listen to."
2,Mysteries to sleep by,"""A Crossworder's Gift"" by Nero Blanc is a collection of five short stories with crossword puzzles, four of which feature crossword puzzle editor Belle Graham and P.I. partner Rosco Polycrates. The stories are bland and inoffensive, the perfect example of the stereotype of a cozy mystery, with thinly drawn characters and mysteries that are not very mysterious. Some pleasure in spending time in various vacation locations (Grand Canyon, Montreal, the Caribbean), but better mysteries can be found that accomplish that with far more style. Biggest mystery: how this series managed to reach seven books."
2,Just terrible,"I read this book with great anticipation because I love crosswords and mysteries. What a horrible disappointment. The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is not realistic at all and the worst part -- which ironically is the most important part of a mystery -- the slick, and a reader would hope, clever, unraveling of the solution is far from either.Every one of the short stories sputters along and then the ""solution"" is thrown at the reader like a bag of soggy oatmeal. Clumsy and unsatisfying.Steer clear of this fiasco. The only reason I give it more than one star is because I still like the premise -- I just wish the authors were more respectful of their readers."
4,An excellent definitive guideline to more fully understanding scripture,An excellent explanation and expansion of the deeper meanning of scripture. It ties in the old and new Testaments by cross referencing the new Testament to many of the chapters and verses of the old Testament..
2,Faded ink!,"This bible has a beautiful cover however I was very disappointed when I looked inside the bible, unlike my KJV this bible has very faded ink as if they ran out of ink and printed the book anyway! Also the font is tiny and hurts your eyes to try and read it! Also this bible is huge and so heavy it makes your arms hurt to hold it very long! I sent it back the very next day!"
3,thin pages plus a lot of material,"First, let me say I like the NKJV. The language used really displays some great meaning behind God's words. I find it most useful when read with another translation like the NIV.The downside is the pages are exceedingly thin, as mentioned by another reviewer. I haven't ripped any yet and have tried to keep them unfolded.The material included is extensive - at times I find the external material almost distracting."
4,Change of version,This was a change of study Bible version from NIV which I have used for 20 years to the NKJV which is used in our congregation for class study and fits my need very well.
1,Unhappy with this player.,"There are a few things that I did not like about this DVD Player. The biggest problem at first was the unresponsiveness. We would often press a button on the remote more than once because we did not think it had registered. Even the buttons on the player were unresponsive.Another minor issue was that we did not like the fact that only the chapter is displayed when the disc is player. We would much rather have the elapsed time shown.At this price, point I also expected the player to have an optical TOSlink audio out connection.The worst problem with this player, though, is that about 2 weeks after purchasing, the player started malfunctioning. When the stop button was pressed, the video would stop, but the disc would continue to spin. If you then ejected the disc, it would spin in the tray. We returned the player and purchased the Sony DVP-NS77H/B which is performing nicely so far.I would avoid this player."
3,Toshiba SD-6000 1080p Upconverting DVD Player,"I like the streamline design. The functionality is fine. The ""upconversion"" aspect is a bit confusing. I guess it does as advertised but I notice a degredation in quality when its upconverted."
5,Great,"I saw ATS recently at the Life 2001 conference in Columbus, OH and that are amazing. I love this c.d.!! Dex has an amazing voice and Andrew has wonderful guitar skills. I can't wait to share this with all my friends"
5,Absolutely incredible!,"This cd contains the absolute best music I have heard this decade. Notice I didn't say the best *Christian* record; no it's the best of all. The fact that it praises God makes it a truly uplifting experience. To any and all who love God and love great music that praises Him, buy this cd. You will not be sorry."
1,Self-Important Drivel,"Even if you are interested in the World's Fair, and loved Devil in the White City, do not be fooled into picking up this work. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Poorly written, totally unlikeable characters, and pompous pseudo-intellectual (read turgid) writing style. I am amazed anyone liked this, and I'd have given it zero stars were that an option. I bought this in hardcover, so I really felt like I wasted significant dollars on this poor effort."
5,Hillarious,"I purchased about 5 copies of this book and gave them to my girlfriends. The content is very amusing and the books makes a great conversation piece and bathroom read!If you take things too seriously, you won't like this book. It is only for those with a sarcastic sense of humor."
5,How to understand your emotions,This is a great book for understanding what emotions are about. I recommend it highly. I also suggest you read Optimal Thinking: How to bbe your best self to learn what causes each emotion and how to make them work best for you. The book gives you incredibly simple roadmaps to understand and resolve all disturbing emotions. Read each of these books!
3,A different approach,"I heard a lot about this book so I thought I would give it a try. It took long time to read, so I can't say it was a quick easy read. It was interesting. I am not sure why it was written in journal form from 5 different people. THey did not really add or take away from what the story was. It just took longer to get to the story, like why was JM and her father so estranged? Who plagurized her story The Moroccan Rose and had it printed in the magazine? Why did she react the way she did when she saw the story? I think it would have been more interesting and easier to read if it were JM's journal I was reading."
1,Absolutely Disappointed,"Giving this product one star is actually over-rating it. I got this microwave for a bridal shower gift. It worked ONCE - after that, it totally quit. The clock is the only thing that works."
4,great buy for the money,this a a great buy for how much it is.the cost is budget friendly and work well if u have other stainless steel appliances!I rate this a 4.5!! ou of 5
2,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"I bought this microwave for $80 at Target about 3 years ago. It worked perfect...even had a nifty little ""popcorn"" button. Then out of the blue I warmed up something and it just shut off. Just like that there was no power. Remember the good ole days when you would buy something and it would last for 10+ years?--Side Note:My dad is bringing me of those good ole days microwave until I get a new one. Guess what brand I will NOT be buying..."
4,Cheap and Practical,"I wanted a cheap pair of shoes for wearing to work (I'm an engineer, no one cares how I dress at work). These aren't as good-looking, or as comfortable, in my opinion as my old Nike Air's, but they're OK. They're good shoes for people who don't like to spend a lot of money on clothes."
5,Perfection,This product works perfectly and it was a very affordable price...almost bought it at target for much more....
4,Still holds up well,"GD was one of my favorites from my college days in Athens GA, and so I recently picked up this CD version. One of their best."
4,Pretty Good,I liked the sexual tension between the characters. This book is pretty good and worth reading. It's my first one by Smith and I plan to read her other novels. My only complaint is slight -- a little too much hatred between the main characters (until the end which more than made up for it).
4,A very good deal for a tape measure.,"I didn't know what to expect from a tape measure that cost me a total of $4.37. I was surprised at what I got. The build quality is good. Appears to be durable and has a smooth mechanism. I like the magnetic tip and the large print on the tape. A very good deal for a tape measure. I gave it 4 stars because their was no ""wow"" factor with this product."
1,A big disappointment!!,"We are fans of David White, but after seeing this film we would be hesitant to watch any more of his films. This movie was not family appropriate. My husband and I were embarrassed watching this with our children. It is not rated so we felt safe to watch it without previewing it first. The story line was just plain silly with no sound message involved. It was actually more on the immoral side. Very immodestly dressed women are seen. It should not be considered a Christian film as it does not advance the Gospel for our Lord Jesus Christ. The acting was very poor. We have seen secular films that had a better message to them. This movie does all Christians an injustice."
1,Confusing,"I thought this movie was going to be a hit. When I watched it, I was very disappointed. I love David White, but this movie was really out of bounds. Would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Is there anything less than 1 star?,"Poorly researched and poorly written. A waste of time, money and trees."
3,"Decent, but Not Vital","Lawler's book is a good example of someone with a powerful interest in a subject, but lacks the follow-through to be a truly great book. The range of the arts covered are vast, though often skimping on the details, and with a heavy focus on Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and other eastern martial arts. If you're interested in comparing techniques from one school to another, this book will not help as it tends toward the cursory review of technical and strategic styles, and seems to lean more heavily on the history of a school. It also has a habit of throwing in some ""dirty little secret"" about a specific art, like required gifts to the head of a school, that just aren't really true anymore. If you're a beginner, this book will help lay the foundation. If you are interested in having a basic research tool as a place to start, this book will also probably serve you well."
4,casio watch,A very nice inexpensive watch.PROS:looks goodnice finishAccuratewater proofCons:the face scratches very easilythe back light is very weak and not good for muchOverall a very nice watch for the price.
5,Smiley Kids make me smile,"This CD and band has been by far my favorite band for the last 6 years. I love them so much that this is the 3rd time Ive bought this cd because stuff keeps happing to it. I also highly recommend the Smiley Kids other CD that they made right before they broke up. Don't let this ledgendary band fade away, buy it now!!!!!"
1,Not Happy!!,"Really not happy!! Both the DATA DVD-ROM and 2nd DVD work fine. The main DVD ""Auto Detail Pro"" doesn't play at all. Judging by the video content on the ""bonus material"" DVD which plays OK, the main ""Auto Detail Pro"" DVD looks promising and informative. The content on the Data DVD-ROM is as if a grade-1 student had put it together. The Data DVD-ROM is rubbish! Looks to be a three and 1/2 star product but I vote one star as I'm peed off at DVD not playing. First time that I'm dissappointed by an Amazon purchase. Not their fault, I Know, but....."
5,Love Story the Sequel,"Two souls meeting on ice - that phrase palesin light ot the true life love story of ice skating pairchampions, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergie Grinkov.As Russion Olympic gold medalists, they captured thehearts of everyone who viewed their artisticand sensitive skating style. From teenagers tomature adults, their relationship is revealed in thisinitimate biography which celebrates the lives ofskating partners and lovers who are separated byGrinkov's sudden and untimely death. Gordeeva, who now performs as a singles' skater, resides in Simsbury, CTwith her young daughter. In My Sergie, she captureswith striking candor the spirit of dedication,commitment and love which was witnessed for one brief shining moment by people in the skating venue andworldwide"
4,the story of a great love,"""Fantastic, excellent, very romantic!"" These are the first words I thought after finishing reading this book. Actually, it's one of the most beautyful book I've ever read all of my life. It made me cry, reading the last chapters, more than watching a moovie. It's not only the story of the two pair skaters' life, but also the story of their great and unlucky love. The real main actor of this tragedy is not Sergey but his young wife Ekaterina who shows her courage to overcome her husband death and go on alone with her daugther Daria, forward a new life. I suggest this book to every fun not only of the two pair skaters but of ice figure skating in general."
2,one serious defect,"It is impossible to know how much water is in the iron. When you fill it you can't see whether or not you have passed the ""MAX"" line."
2,Hmm!! Average one,"Not so good as described. A bit sticky, can hold only small quantity of water for the steam. So you end up filling it for each cloth."
5,Great for Reiki,"As a Reiki practitioner, I use the Crystals: Mind, Body, and Soul Series for many Reiki sessions. I find the music to be both relaxing and powerful. Along with Reiki, the music is great for crystal healing. With crystals, the music is very effective in removing blockages and distortions from the energy fields. But you don't have to practice Reiki to enjoy this cd. It's great for relaxation and meditation. The music contains gentle bells, chimes, crystals, keyboard, and nature sounds. It's also a great cd to fall asleep to. I give it a 5 star rating!"
3,Great,"This is a great album. I like every song on it. It always reminds me of my late friend - it's him who introduce it to me.Now, let me know if you can get me one, I'll order it once you notify me.Hope to hear from you soon."
1,worst media of all time,"On a new Macbook Pro, using Toast vers. 8, every other disk is a coaster, and that is burning at 2x. I usually use Verbatim media and see near 100% success rates."
2,A once great product,"Memorex used to be a brand I would purchase without hesitation, but after several spindles of increasing problem blanks I won't buy them again."
2,inferior to retail store dvd's,"I previously had been buying 50 pack memorex Dvd spindles from target and had no problems using them in my Dvd recorder and windows Pc to make my own Dvd recordings. I received an amazon gift card for Xmas and decided to buy a 100 pack spindle of memorex dvd's from amazon with it thinking the blank dvds were the same as the ones from the retail stores. Wrong. Out of the ten blank Dvds I've used so far, only two have been usable. The other eight were either unreadable in my Dvd recorder or failed to burn successfully in my Pc Dvd burner. I won't be buying blank dvds from amazon again."
1,Don't buy these.,"I used these DVDs to back up about 60 of my movies, and now when I try to play them back about 1/3 are faulty and stop playing. I am going to try Verbatim next, which at this time on special are only about $10 more expensive than Memorex."
1,don't buy this product,This product was of bad quality. Every single dvd skipped and didn't record well. I don't advise anybody to buy this product.
4,No problems with these disks.,"I have had no problem using these disks. I have bought several packs and all disks seem to work and have been great in transferring home movies, doing computer backups, etc."
5,Great product,These DVDs work flawlessly.I've used about half so far and have not had one bad one. Worth every penny!
2,"Great product, damaged by Amazon in shipping","Product is great, I've used it before. Never had a problem or a disc go bad. Unfortunately, Amazon shipped it dreadfully slow, it arrived a week after it was supposed to and the spindle cases were cracked in shipment. Luckily the discs were fine."
2,Worst packaging,"I've read a comment about bad packaging,, and thought ""hey, how bad they could get?"", then bought 10 of this product. I was wrong.They arrived in 5pcs per box. One box was well packaged, nice and tidy.Second one was horror itself. All 5 cake box was broken down to pieces, and much of the DVDs were scattered inside the packaging box.To date, this is the worst packaging I saw during past 6 years of online shopping."
1,Memorex DVD+R 16x 4.7GB 100 Pack Spindle,"I purchased the above item as a Christmas gift for my son. When I received it, the package was opened and the plastic cover was broken and a piece of the plastic was chipped off and missing. Since I didn't have time to replace it before Christmas, I went ahead and gave it to my son anyway. If it had been purchased for anyone else, or if I had had more time, and if the shipping charges weren't so expensive, I would have returned it for a replacement. I was not at all satisfied with this purchase. I have not checked with my son to see if the DVDs worked properly."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have burned Maxell, Verbatim, TDK and Memorex DVD+-R's and Verbatim DVD+R DL's. The only brand that has made my burner malfunction in addition to resulting in wasted time and media has been Memorex. My system is a 18 months old, a fairly powerful Windows XP Dell desktop, with a very good Sony burner."
5,Beautiful Dream Pop,"Lovers of Belle & Sebastian and the Clientele will like this album with its wispy dreamy tunes, mostly slow in pace. Some harken to 1960s nostalgia. What's good about this album is the consistency of the songs so that they all fit together. No grating surprises. Everything is woven from the same fabric. If you like this slow, sometimes folk rock melancholy sound, also check out Swedish pop band Ronderlin, Arco, and The Innocence Mission."
4,THE BOOK FOR ALL 3D ARTISTS!,This book is what I've been waiting for ever since I started doing 3d work as a game artist four years ago. This book is good for people of all levels as it's well done and makes learning one of the many ways for modeling fun. My one complaint is it doesn't cover using surface tools for modeling. Surface tools is the widely preferred method of modeling organic shapes but instead covers modeling with primitives. Because of this I don't think it's worth five stars and instead would give it 4.5 stars. My thanks go to Paul Steed!
2,"Modeling A Character in 3DS Max, 2nd Edition",I was expected more model of the book but the whole book only teached one model
4,3DS Character Modeling,"I'm a noob so any available tutorials on 3ds modeling will help enhance my knowledge and skills. Even though this product uses a specific model to explain the techniques involved in modeling a character, it's guidance and helpful to me."
2,"Not bad, not that good.","To be honest, I almost bought this book. When I have thought considered for about 2 days at home, I decided No.Here comes the comments, I don't really like the hair, I always wish to buy a book that is very comprehensive about hair modelling and perfect body modelling. In contrast, the body part which is being modelled of that character is great and quite appealing.Bad news is, in this book, the polygonal hair is way too bad and unappealing for a game character. Unlike Kate Walker from Syberia, she has a very beautiful perspective because of the realism of her hair(very detailed) and the textures that suit her body structure. Not to say that the textures of the girl in this book is bad, but it looks like a tattoo clumped to her naked torso and legs. Looks so unreal !And the other things is that, the functions were mostly based on 3DsMax 3, and the functions are slightly different from 3DsMax 4. Just beware of that."
5,Mr. Shaw Is STILL Shipshape,This was one of my favorite books as a child. I LOVED it. When my niece and nephew were down we read it again and again. They love it too - so now I'm getting it for them!!!
2,"Flimsy, shreds, too much space between reeds for shade","Was disappointed in this product. Too much space between the reeds which doesn't show on the picture. Had to double it to get the shade I want, so it's half the size I expected. Looks cheap and pieces fall off the reeds very easily. I have secured it to my deck with galvanized wire at bottom and middle every few inches, and I know it's secure, it won't go anywhere, but it looks bad, it doesn't stand up well. Will use temporarily until I can find something better."
3,Flawed,"I've had two of these watches. I love the features and design. My only problem with them is the ease with which the case breaks. Both watches have broken at the upper right corner where the strap attaches to the case. Unfixable! It did not take a lot of force to break them. So, unless you are sure you never brush your arm against something I would not recommend this watch."
2,Inspiration L,Minimal investigation into many great ideas. Not much meat on some big bones. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.
1,not worth buying,"After sending this book or should I say ""booklet"" to my mom for her birthday gift, I was completely embarassed after my mom sent it back to me to read. There was very little info that people don't already know and the statistic information was complicated to understand and of little use. They rate the slot machines and then discount all that data by mentioning that the manufactorer sets the machines according to each casino. So don't waste your money and definately don't send as a gift!"
1,Did not Grow,"I bought this product thinking it would be adorable and interesting. I got it in the mail with no issues at all. Repeatedly watering, sunlight, and heat didn't help this plant to grow. I found it very nice to see that the company included an extra seed packet to insure that just in-case that if the plant didn't grow there would be extra seeds to plant in another pot."
2,Don't Bother,"With weak characterizations, unfathomable motivations, disjointed story line and less than believable plot....this story is about as gut wrenching and dramatic as waiting for your lawn to grow, but in the end, much less fullfilling."
5,Cross Stitching for the Seriously Bent Individual,"Love, love, love it. Where else will you find the ability to take a historial art form and moderize it = saying what you REALLY mean. Love it! Great laugh and great art!!!"
5,Get your friends to start stitching,"Julie is a genius! Her designs are a hoot and inspired my daughter and her boyfriend to each do a cross stitch piece. There are several in this book that I will be doing myself, both for myself and for gifts. Friends that have seen it have asked for different ones, it is quite popular. Definately worth the price."
5,a huge hit!,"i bought this book on a whim; i was tired of the same boring cross stitch books. being in my twenties, i'm not interested in ""old lady"" patterns. i created one of the designs in this book for a guy friend of mine for his birthday and he LOVED it!! now all my friends are requesting different ones for their birthday. i wish she'd come out with a second book with more designs because i'm already running out!"
3,I was disappointed,"I like the idea of Subversive Cross Stitch. However, there's nothing in here that you couldn't do with a generic alphabet and motif pattern book."
5,Divine and captivating for everyone,"Jesus suffered, died and rose from the dead for ALL of our sins. In this 30 minute DVD you will be captivated by the stories told in such a simple manner that everyone will really understand about salvation.[A MUST FOR EVERY VIDEO LIBRARY] 1 John 4:10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins."
5,journey to the atom,"this book was my first real initiation into the sufi tradition and it was a fortunate one.what distinguishes this book from any other book on sufism that i have ever encountered, is that it has what the arabic-speakers call ""baraka"". that is, ""blessing"", a kind of spiritual energy that can permeate a person or a place.this book, then, delivers not only infromation about the path, but a kind of energetic pull into the world of universal Islam and sufism.medicine for what ails us in this era. Nur/Hixon must have known we would need it."
5,Re-release of music from the 80's - FINALLY!!,"I love ""The Cars"". I love ""Benjamin Orr"" ... why wouldn't I? He was a band member of ""The Cars"". I owned this on both vinyl and cassette. When I converted to CD's, it was nowhere to be found. Now it's BACK and re-mastered ... yay! As soon as I saw it, I ordered it. Great stuff! Highly recommended for any 80's fan!"
2,An imaginative but good read....,"I am sorry I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviews, but I do not agree that this book stands up to every biblical test as it brings too many unanswered questions to my mind - & I have been walking with the Lord for 36 years as He has been taking me through quite a few experiences (my testimony is online) though none were ""near death."" I came away from reading this book with the impression that it could possibly have been a result of the author's imagination. I was not convinced that it truly represents heaven. But it is a good, enjoyable read even though it may be fictional."
5,"Comforting, to say the least","This little book was given to me by my Pastor, when I confided in him concerning my ultimate fear, 'death'. I was both comforted, and given hope for eternity via this book. Every Christian should read it, own it, and keep extras on hand to give to others who are wrestling with lifes ultimate fear, and/or grieving the loss of a loved one. Wonderful reading!"
5,such peace,"This book brought such peace to me after my Dad passed. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has lost a loved one, knows that they are with their Savior, but needs a lift."
5,GREAT BOOK,"Very sweet book, easy reading and a great faith builder it just makes Heaven so real to you that you can,t wait to go."
2,Does not seem to work correctly,"This comes with a holding tank for the water with hooks that hang it on the side of the flower pot, a hose that goes down into the water and has a ceramic type bulb that sticks down into the soil. It's like the porous type material that self watering planters (such as for violets) uses. I filled the tank, and inserted the tube, then hung it on the flower pot and put the ceramic bulb into the soil. I checked back a few days later to find the soil bone dry and my plant wilting. So even though it sounded like a good idea for those times when I'm not home to water the plants, it didn't work for me. I won't be buying anymore of these."
3,Disappointing.,I tried this while out of town for six days and it did not seem to work. The soil was dry when I got back even though the plastic container was still full of water.Other reviewers have left tips that I should try. Maybe then it would work. But the system should work more simply than that; it is basically a water container and a wick. And it is not good-looking although it is not real ugly either.
1,wrong item,they send me a walbro in a box of mallory now i can return whath im supose to do nothing i not have a mallory pump and i can return im not gone a buy nothing more in amazon im not thrust any more thankss
1,Just plain AWFUL!!!,"There are no other ways to explain this book but STINKY, PITIFUL, and AWFUL! I sure hope that if you buy this book you don't actually plan on fixing anything specific. The authors of this book raced through and tried to give as little detail about the repairs they were doing as possible.I will never own another Chilton's manual. I suggest you stick with the Haynes manuals. The detail is much greater, the pictures are MUCH better, and they actually tore down and rebuilt the vehicle in the Haynes manual.Please don't waste your money on this pitiful excuse for a repair manual!!"
4,The Kenny Garrett of the tenor,"Rick Margitza is the Kenny Garrett of the tenor. There is no doubt of his musical maturation since his Miles Davis' years. His fire seems somewhat softened. He has his own style of playing immediately recognisable as ""Margitza"". (Maybe he could improve a bit in story-telling. In that respect he is still behind Branford Marsalis.) With Jeff Gardner, Margitza has found a co-genial partner (reminding me of Liebman/Beirac). The rhythm-group (Danielsson and Vidacovich) is doing an excellent job. ""Game of Chance"" is a nice recording. For a live-recording, however, the band plays rather a bit too controlled. The brakes are rarely let loose, the forms are kept, the last adventure is avoided. Moreover, all the tunes are structured in the same way: sax-solo first, piano second etc."
4,Klipsch - High Quality Sound,"The order experience was very positive. The process was simple and the product was delivered in advance of the anticipated delivery date. I was extremely pleased with the price of the speakers which was significantly lower than what I saw on other websites and at retail. As for the Klipsch speakers, they produce high-quality sound."
3,Disney hype truck,"This toy is overpriced, but of course Disney can do this. My 3 1/2 year old grandson was very anxious to get this toy and he loves it. Sleeps with it on the foot of his bed!"
1,Way Overpriced!,"OK, it's my fault. I was frantically trying to buy a ""cool"" gift for a 4 year old. I didn't read the description closely and was really really disappointed with this item. I was expecting something a lot bigger for the $$$. It is just so tiny and uninteresting. I may just sell it on ebay and buy something better. DO NOT BUY!"
3,21/2 year old just loved Mack!,"I thought the Mack Playset was junky and did not seem very well made, but my nephew who watches the Cars movie almost daily just loved Mack. We do have fun playing with this truck. Difficult to open for a small child, but once open there are all kinds of gadgets inside to care for Lightning McQueen. The little frig with the oil can inside, the tv screen, and the tiny toothbrush were all fun in pretend play! Would not recommend this truck for a child that is destructive and may put things into their mouth."
5,Mack,Great play set. My son enjoys playing with it. His big sister has been seen playing with it too. As always BEWARE of lead paint toy recalls.
4,Home for a Car,"My sons LOVE this. It has been pretty durable - the car wash fell apart pretty quickly, but the rest of the pieces are still intact, and he is very rough with his toys. The boys fight over it constantly, so I will have to get another one for the next upcoming birthday. If I had used a bit of glue on the car wash pieces at the start, I think they would still be there, but even with them missing, it's been a fun toy for them both, ages 6 and 3."
3,Grandson loved it!,I purchased this for my Grandson because it's what he wanted. He loves it and plays with it all the time. I however was surprised at the size. Was expecting something bigger. I also question the durablility of the product.
2,Tiny truck with Big price tag,"For fear that my two boys, ages 4 & 8, would fight over this item on Christmas morning, I foolishly bought two. Fortunately, I bought one at Target and paid only the original price of $14.99 and then watched as the price for the truck skyrocketed as the holidays drew nearer. This truck is tiny and is waaaay overrated by the photos. There are many tiny little pieces that my children have already lost or broken. The truck is so cheaply made that it is a joke. Save your money or buy mine for a buck at my summer rummage sale. Very disappointing purchase."
4,My son's favorite!,"My son got it for Christmas and it is his favorite toy (along with bunch of die cast cars from the same movie) ever since. My son sleeps with it, eats with it and even takes it into the bath tab. It is pretty durable, I only wish that eyes on the truck would be painted not stickers, after couple of baths they started to peel off... does not seem to bother my son though. There are a lot of activities for pretend play inside the truck and when open it could be occupied with 3 cars, so McQueen can have friends over. Holds 2 cars when closed. Highly recommend for a Cars fan!"
3,Cute but not heavy duty,"This is a nice toy but the plastic used to make it is flimsy. I'm afraid that with a couple of good crashes or my four year old trying to pull it apart it is going to break. This is not a toy that will make it into the spring...but for a Christmas present it hit the spot. It's a great toy for any boy who is in love with the movie CARS, however, IT DOES NOT COME WITH A LIGHTING MCQUEEN CAR! I thought that it did from all the pictures...I was wrong."
5,Best Buy,"Having tried the range of bay rums, I am convinced that for cost, ease of use, aroma GABELS Bay Rum is the best buy available."
5,A clean and aromatic body rub,Excellent value. Well used after a shower or even better in consonance with a good close shave. Feels great and smells very nice especially in anticipation of the workday. A great value - why would you spend far more money for mucl less product that is of inferior qulity?
2,Not for me,The scent reminds me of clove and nutmeg. It's pleasant but it lingers a lot longer than I would like. I think I noticed it a good 10 hours after I put it on. It does make my face feel great after a shave but I also think the bay oil is causing me to break out. I'll probably stop using it. I should also mention that it took 9 days to get a shipping confirmation which said it was already delivered. It was then delivered 4 days after that.
5,Great entertainment and Broadway Cast,I saw Jersey Boy's in Vegas and was surprised of Frankie Valli'slife. My impression of him has changed since I saw the play andheard his songs. CD and play were both excellent.
1,Completely Misleading,"This CD is horrible!!! And I LOVE the Jersey Boys. I bought it thinking it was the London cast, because that's what it said, only to find that it was the broadway cast!!! London's versions are much more amazing and the lead singer on this CD that plays Frankie has a horrible, pitchy, tone. I wish I could return it but I already opened it. I just had to give it away. I'm really peeved though. What a waste of 25 dollars!!! I would never have spent that much had I known it would be such mediocre attempts..."
5,Jersey Boys Rule,Great show and great CD.Half the price on line than if you purchased it at the show.I listen to it time and time again.
5,Great Album,"Having seen ""Jersey Boys"" in London, I wanted the CD to relive the music. I was pleased that much of the supporting dialog was in the CD as well. Unlike many CDs from musicals, which contain only the songs, it's possible to get the gist of the show from this CD. Well produced too."
5,Those Jersey Boys!,"I never thought that Jersey Boys would be such a hit on Broadway enough to win Tony Award for Best Musical. Although Broadway has not really brought out anything spectacular but everybody who has seen it live as loved it. If you can't spend money on tickets to see the show, you might as well by the compact disc and just imagine the live performance. The Four Seasons were one of the biggest music groups of the last century. Who would have thought that these four Jersey boys from Belleville, New Jersey also hometown to actor Joe Pesci would become such a huge hit. The show and the compact disc show how it began for them with all the trials and tribulations. If you can't see the show regardless of cost or travel, why not buy the compact disc? I have bought two for other people."
5,Zink- Dianna's Review,"Zink was a book that very well touched my insides. Becky found out early in the story that she had gotten a cancer called, Leukemia. She was very scared while she was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy. Becky was all alone and frightened. Then, the Z'bras started showing Becky their own world. Everyone else thought that she was hallucinating but she was really having the best time of her life. Becky didn't have to think about needles, sicknesses, or shots while she was in the Z'bras world. It was like those horrible things didn't even exist. Becky played games with the Z'bras and just relived her life with them. Sadly, in the end of the story, Becky died. The happy side was that she was finally going home.The author, Cherie Bennett, was very thoughtful in this book. She thought about others. Cherie actually wrote this book after finding an one-paged story that a girl wrote about zebras. Sadly, this girl died from cancer too. Thanks Cherie for thinking of others."
1,This book is fiction!,"Richard Reynolds did a horrible job writing this book. He even had to self publish. He is in hiding now and will not even face the family of the victims he wrote about. He misled the family members when prodding them for information for his book. My sister is one of the murdered victims. Richard made up his idea of my sister based on information he received from the murderers which was based on what they wanted to make up and on heroine addicts that had no idea about reality. My sister was not the person that is portrayed in the book. Richard failed to put in the truths about her. Unfortunately now, everything that is broadcast or published concerning these serial killers is based on a fictional book which is an injustice to my sister, her family and the other victims that these people killed. Richard has raped my sister of her identity with his horrible misleading book."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Very disapointing. Logs look fake. Fire doesn't burn like picture, looks more like a burner on your stove (blue flame). If I could return them I would."
4,adapting to life as a slave in Jamaica can be hard,"This is a good story about different reactions to the slave trade by a father and son stolen from their home in Africa and brought to Jamaica. The way they respond to their new environments (on 2 different plantations 20 miles apart) are so different. It is interesting to learn what is important to each, and see how they adapt. And it is interesting to make some comparisons between the slave system in Jamaica vs American by reading this. The only problem I had with this book is the lack of chapters. It is just one long story with the occasional break of a blank line between paragraphs. Otherwise this is an excellent relatively short book that presents the fictional lifes of two slaves."
3,Ajeemah and His Son,"Overall I think that this was an ok book and it was pretty informative and showed people what it was like back when there was slaves. I would recommend this book but probably to a little lower grade level,like fourth or fifth grade since it was so short."
4,Enter Richard Greene as Robin Hood.,"I know it's a kids show, but Richard Greene makes a very good Robin Hood."
3,It's all over the map,"Stand Up is an album typical of the time it was produced. It's good, but fragmented. When you have such diverse talents as Peter Frampton, Eric Johnson and Allan Holdsworth on the same disc, it's bound to have high and low points. Alot of people who know Morse tend to want to have instrumentals only. I think it's great that there is at least some vocal work on this album, Alex Ledgerwood, on a tune co wrote with Frampton. It's not great, it's not bad, there are high points and low points. Enjoy the artistry and the effort. It's fun!"
4,A good show but not white hot Pete,"I too believe Pete Townshend to be THE rock and roll master. And even acoustically, he can kick major ____. On this CD, ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere"", ""Drowned"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" are just outstanding. My regret is that similar paced tunes were not more predominant instead of the average sounding tunes like ""North Country Girl"". I understand he did ""The Kids Are Alright"" and ""Sensation"", which I think would have been more energetic. That said, it is a very good album and shows Pete has not lost any of his guitar playing flair."
5,book,Brand new book.Never before read.Read it a long time ago.Wanted to reread it.Part of a set of three.Ordered all three at same time.
3,Duvet so so,We put an old down comforter inside it and really liked it till about 3 days later when we noticed the comforter inside movies all around.I sewed the ends to the Duvet and it works wonderfully now.
1,Beware of Quality,"I bought this duvet cover for our son as I loved the color combination & promise of soft flanel. Unfortunately we put the thing thru the washer/dryer & it fell apart. I had white pilled balls all over the place. I would not reccomend this for a childs bed, perhaps a guest bed, where you aren't as obligated to wash on a regular basis."
3,"Love the duvet, but. . ..","The duvet is very nice and quite comfortable. However, I am having problems with the buttons coming off."
2,huge,"While the quality might be good, it is HUGE and does not look elegant as it appears in the picture. The hand shower is also poorly designed. you have to press down the knob all the time to release water"
2,A swing and a miss,"I love Gerry Anderson but this really is a dud. For me and most people, I think, the main attraction of these shows was the production design-it just looked so freakin' cool!! Cool sets, great gadgets, etc. That's sorely missing from this. Not to mention the fact that to my American ears, ""Unwinese"" is completely unintellible, and, as another reviewer pointed out, a pretty thin thing to hang a series on. Having said that, since you can get it for $5 plus shipping, if you like Anderson you might as well take a look."
2,3D should not be in the Title,"another 720p 3D movie out there. not worth the money. im not reviewing this as if i want to tell you about the movie itself.. i rate movies that are placed in the 3D category for their 3D quality. there is NO pop out effect, looks as if this wasnt even filmed in 3D at all.if they took 3D off the cover then i wouldnt be so pissed about about my purchase.out of 250 3D movies i own now, this is in the bottom 10 for 3D effect.BUYER BEWARE, dont buy this hoping you will see 3D, its not that way at all."
3,Orthodoxy as Biblical versus Constantinian state church,"I'd simply like to put in two cents. We agree with the necessity of Biblical orthodoxy, that is, teachings that conform to the Bible's revelation - ""the doctrine that conforms people to godly living,"" a test Paul advocates in 1 Tim. 6. However, we can fall off on the other side as well, if we take Church Councils as the sole definer. Is sword or majority politics the arbiter of truth? If so, we'll soon see the need to join one Church, in a reunited Roman Catholic-Orthodox organization.A good look at the huge shift via Constantine in comparison to the apostolic faith once delivered to the saints is found in Dr. Robert Heidler's book The Messianic Church Arising. Heidler is not a Judaizer, but does properly balance OT roots (Rom. 11:18), instead of assuming the directions Greek questions took theology are the answer to modern reformation."
1,MENS WATCH ? TOO SMALL WRIST BAND .......,"I am very annoyed at Casio for putting shorter wrist straps on there DATA BANK MODELS sold as MEN'S WATCH'S . I have many Men's Casio watch's and they all fit, have a long enough wrist band . This does not fit my wrist that is not even wide/big ."
2,It has stopped,Nice and easy to use. But afert 2 month the watch has stopped. The watch display all modes in a bucle. Ican't stop it and the buttoms don't works.
3,Proof that of what we all knew all along...,"Clinton is no democrat. He takes the popular road. Although he claims to be a democrat, as Stephanopolous says in the book, most of Clintons programs were popular republican programs that Bush could not get passed by a democratic congress. Bush was not good at foreign policy and bad at domestic policy. He was great at both, it was the democratic congress that nearly drove this country into the ground with costly government programs. This book reaffirms who should have won in 92. Bush. Mr Stephanopolous is a brilliant mind, but I think this book was another attempt by him and the president to make Clinton look like a great guy just doing his job, when in actuallity this guy has brought more scandal and disgust to the American government than any other president. Too bad Americans care more about their wallet than accountability and integrity. SPIN GEORGE SPIN"
1,Opportunist Extraordinaire,"This book just proves that, when opportunity knocks in the age of selfishness, who can resist?"
1,A Sad Commentary,"Sadly, I have no real alternative but to agree with a published editiorial...""From Booklist April 1, 1999 ...And this is a sleazy, but all too human, way to make a buck. Bonnie Smothers.""I read the book hoping for so much more. What I found was a book of self-serving rubbish and CYA mentality. If the scandals had not been exposed to the extent that they were, I have no doubt, whatsoever that this man would still be in the thick of things. Just as with any child, getting caught has a way of forcing guilty explanation and false repentance."
3,Inside the Clinton Whitehouse,"As a conservative Republican, I read this book by a Northern Liberal to gain insight as to how this country kept voting for such a flawed individual as Bill Clinton when the truth was known. I also saw the author many times on Sunday talk shows smoothly defending the administration against everything negative!Well, I came away from this book sorry that I never knew George S. even though I disagreed with his politics. His inside tales of the Clinton White House were entertaining and informative and showed a determined, competant, and energetic politician who is flawed like the rest of us.These kinds of books show me how refreshing politics would be if politicians would speak into a microphone in the same way they speak in their inner circles when formulating policy. Would we ever be INFORMED voters then!"
3,All Too Human a story!,"In this rite-of-passage memoir, a president's senior advisor, learns the price of glory & power inside the labyrinth of politics. His elan, skills & ethics are honed & tested as he assists in winning the White House for his candidate & surviving the gossip, obfuscations & associations once there. George Stephanopoulos thinks & writes with lucid, personable skill. I've seen him on ABC's <I>This Week</I> & can hear his voice speaking this book into existence. It's a fast, informative, frequently breathtaking rendition of an illusory era."
4,Truthful Account,"Stephanopolous gave a truely honest account of his time with the Clintons. It is an intimate story and he does a good job of keeping neutral in that he praises Clinton and himself, but also criticizes. Not for one not interested in politics!"
3,A look at self through corrupted idealism,"George's book reminded me why I am so troubled by politics. Can any president exist and work toward honest goals without succumbing to the mind-numbing necessity of spin? George recounts what appears (I truly am a skeptic) to be the honest story of a person sacrificing ""some"" to attain ""some."" The question of doing ""what is right vs. what will work"" called forth a philisophical question I am still churning. In many ways, I relate to his story albeit through a different career -- also one in which idealism is applauded until you find yourself on the ""inside"" of the organization. The book is written well and tells of the history of the administration without divulging too much. A good read for someone interested in knowing more about the backdrop of some well-known moments in Clinton's political history."
4,Pay attention to lost opportunities.,"More than providing unique and intimate details of the innerworkings of the Clinton Whitehouse, this book demonstrates how elected officials become isolated despite nearly constant contact with people. The closest advisor and the president lost the benefits of frank discussion between two intelligent, knowledgeable people due to protocol, deference and power struggles. Any advisor, staffer, elected or appointed official should read this book to understand how gaps are created between these various positions, even when collaboration is the intent. ""All Too Human"" offers a wake-up call to staffers -- pay attention, be forthright about facts and biases, speak your mind despite repercussions. And to officials - pay attention, be forthright and be aware of how the power of the office can contort what people tell you. Plus reward honesty."
2,The Tale of Two Books,"It's hard to argue that George Stephanopolous is an extremely intelligent, well-spoken idealist, but he makes the mistake of attempting to write two books in one with ""All Too Human."" He's a cheerleader throughout most of the book, but it's as if he was compelled to be critical sporadically to sell more books. The book doesn't flow. His portrayal of the political machinations in America today are fascinating, and disturbing."
3,Inside look is a yawner,"Interesting at times, this book never got off the ground regarding getting into the nitty gritty of the Clinton White House. Hoping to get the inside gouge on our president, his decisions and life, I walked away respecting him more than before.It was however very insightful into the life of George Stephanopolous. As awkward as it must have been for the author, he bares his mistakes and triumphs for all to read. In this book he covers not so much the candidate and president but how the author influenced decisions and perceptions. His actions did in fact change how we looked at the reality of our man Clinton.Whether you like him or not; George Stephanopolous tilted, skewed and otherwise distorted the views and changed how the public eye pictures William Jefferson Clinton.This proved an interesting perspective and just how far a candidate will go to ""Wag the Dog"" and also how far American Voters will let him."
1,hail to the turncoat!,"for all of his professions about honesty lacking in Washington DC i find it rather ironic that George Stephanopolous spends much of this book ratting out anyone he ever came into contact with. Despite his feelings for the president he should have kept his mouth (and his laptop) shut because for right or wrong Clinton made him what he is today. His ego is larger than the entire Government and i could not stand his whinning about how he burning himself out. This book is a search for vindication against those whom he feels have wronged him and a private pity party for himself. i gave this book one star because, despite my feelings for him, the puncuation is at least correct and consistant throughout the book. I hope he can live with himself. I wouldn't have been able to."
1,AWFUL,"I am an eighth grader taking Geometry, so it is obviously advanced. However, this book is not helpful AT ALL in learning. It is so frustrating to not even have a glossary in the back to find definitions, and the book does a very bad job of explaining tough concepts. If you are a teacher, please try a different book."
1,I hated this book and i sitll do...,"This Geometry book is a lousy waste of time...I'm a 13 year old 8th grade student in Geometry... this book [is] wastewater... to be conservative... First of all... it doesnt go into detailed explanations watsoever on the stuff they have in their... the Circles section of this book was one of the worst i have ever seen indeed u mite think im just a lousy low grade student who doesnt study... but actually im a straight A+'s student... but because of this book's lousy and downright concise information, i got a really bad score on a couple of big tests... never get this book it is a waste of money for your school district and a waste on your student's learning time...PS the hints on the back of the book arent really hints at all... they just give u another riddle to solve..."
3,Can be difficult to understand,"Michael Serra's ""Discovering Geometry"" is a great book if you are going to use it for honors courses. It can be difficult to understand because you have to figure out EVERYTHING (i.e. definitions to vocabulary terms). Though it can be difficult if you love math you may love this book. Also, just because you may have done well in Algebra 1, doesn't mean you'll do well in geometry."
5,"Ruy Lopez, Open Defense obtained from Amazon",This excellent review enabled me to improve my handling of this defense that i have used for many years. Now I can handle the new challenges developed for White.
4,See new parts of the World,"Not up to standards of ""In the Footsteps of Alexander"" but only because the myths he explores in these shows have less of an historical basis. This is still a fun learning experience and a good introduction to two more myths (including how Jason's story really ended) that have influenced Western culture.Louis J Sheehan"
4,Good quality repair part,This Guide is well dimensioned. Screws provided were a bit on the long side. Package description should mention that it contains 2 guides in one package.
5,Helpful Selfhelp book!,"This book is in wonderful condition, it is in nearly new condition and I would purchase from this seller again and again."
5,"Cheesy Read, but fabulous, do-able system!","Reading this I felt like I was in 2nd grade, but I didn't mind because I could read it all in one night, and it had a great, do-able system that I could implement immediately. I started the system the next day and had 6 new refferals in one month. Not only did it talk about a good system, it gave exact examples and wording that made it so much easier for those of us who have trouble putting the final product together."
2,"Effective, but simplistic","Effective in getting its point across, in an easy ""storytelling"" manner. Annoyingly simplistic, however. While the author bent over backwards to not be ""preachy,"" he ended up being preachy anyway. Some useful information, but mostly a waste of time."
4,Pleased,"The book came in plenty of time before school started. The book was in good shape, just as it was advertised."
2,this book is awful,This book is an awful book. The examples given are bad examples and most are not like the questions which makes it hard to understand.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:George Sanders is good as usual and the movie works reasonably well (the ""brick wall"" motif at the end is quite effective), but there's just not a lot here--the movie feels padded even in its brief running length and not a whole lot happens."
5,Bill will be1st against the wall when the revolution comes,"Read this book to find out why. The book is quite dull. The ideas are what any ten year old can deduce when you explain what the internet is. Actually, it misses the point that the internet allows communities to grow and collective understanding to reach new levels. If you don't know much about Gates or microsoft then it would be an illuminating read. The few dollars you spend on this book may save you a whole lot more in the future :-)"
1,Only anecdotes and examples.,The book seems to be more of a marketing tool to sell Microsft products rather than try and define a scope for future managers. I was highly disappointed. I think it is a poor book.
3,This book shows Mr. Gates visionary abilities of business.,This book shows that how a future is going to be affected by the internet services whether it is small or a large business. The description about the digital nervous system is appreciable.
4,"900 Lb Gorrilla Writes Book, Essential Reading","No doubt largely written by staff assistants, this book can be considered a watered-down version of Microsoft's game plan for taking over the world, i.e. being the operating system for everything. Each chapter has a useful figure that sums up business lessons and methods for diagnosing one of the aspect's of one's digital nervous system. This is a great airplane book. Like him or not, when the 900 lb digital gorrilla writes a book, we all have to read it."
1,What do you want to sell today?,"This was just awful. Bill is simply trying to put you in the frame of mind that the future depends on.....you guessed it...windows!With newer, faster, and overall better OSs actually starting to show up, Gates is doing what he does best, selling you his OS. Linux is not as fully functioning(but wayyyyy more stable) as MS products, but watch out, it soon will be."
1,A Real Snooze,"Nothing new here, and much of it is wrong-headed. First step, Bill needs a new ghostwriter for his next book... someone that can put a little snap in his verse. He keeps saying the same thing the same way.Second, his various claims that technology was the competitive advantage in his case studies is just flat wrong. For instance, the Japanese did not cave Detroit's head in because they had more computers and infrastructure, as Bill would have you believe. They had better business and engineering practices. That has been well-established in the business research press.The list goes on . . .A real disappointment that Bill put his name on this eighth-grade term paper."
3,Worth reading for anybody involved in corporate IT,"First published in 2000 this book provides valuable insight for corporations looking to leverage computers to improve their business. Although I suspect it will seem dated by 2005. The book provides an insight into what Bill Gates is seeing already and expecting in the near future. The book is something of a sales/technology pitch but few can afford to ignore the plans of Microsoft. I liked his view that, for example, telesales personal should use the same user-interface as the on-line customer -- to reduce intial cost, maintenance and inconsistency [seems obvious but it still tends to be the exception rather than the norm].I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book while driving into work over a period of weeks. I found it pretty interesting and the audio format allowed me to get through it at a reasonable pace without any difficulty. I think I would have found it a little dry to read (and I read a lot of dry technical material!)."
3,Where do you want to go today Mr. Gates?,"As far I have known, Microsoft and Mr.Gates have a reputation for pushing windows wherever they can.Call it marketing strategy or pushing it down people's throats, this continues in this book. Mr.Gates is laying the road to his company's success in the future. After all, if more people use technology, more WindowsXX can be bundled with new computers. That's all that is there to this book. Full Stop."
4,the title is a well done sumarize of that book,"This book is well made and I think is highly recommended to read. Are you thinking about opening a business or making your business better? This book has the hints you need; I believe; even if you don't have a business, this book will teach you something. You can see how good this book is; by helping you anderstand how to run a business today. Bill Gates helped himself advertizing and selling software! This is a good book for you to read, but you don't have to take my word for it."
3,"OK, but...","I thought the book had a few interesting points to make, but it did come over a bit like a Marketing Brochure for Microsoft!It was a relatively easy read. Not for someone who's been neck deep in eBusiness for a while, but gentle enough to be an introduction. On that basis I would recommend it."
1,Disappointing,This book was a disappointment to me due to the lack of staying with one train of thought. The author is all over the lot. I was hoping to receive information about each card that would give me a way of using the deck itself. That was not forthcoming.
5,My Hubby Loves It!!!,My husband has had the same watch for a long time. When we went camping he didn't want to wear it. So the whole trip I had to turn on my cellphone to see what time it was. That's why I bought this one. It lights up and amazes him...so easily amused. Now he doesn't want to wear it camping cuz it might get broken. So I am thinking about getting one for myself even though I don't wear a watch.MsStretch
2,Battery Vampire,"The battery on this watch was drained in only two years. I've moved on to a solar watch, hoping for a longer lifespan.The watch functions well, just don't expect it to last."
1,Loud and obnoxious,"My 2-yr old son loves Tigger but has trouble warming up to this one. It's too loud and he doesn't understand that he is supposed to squeeze the body parts instead of pointing to it. Even when he's right, it tells him he's wrong because he didn't apply enough pressure to the sensor. He gets frustrated because he knows he indicated the right part."
2,"an emphasis on the ""miss""","I adore just about anything Spike, and really enjoyed the film he made playing this character - but man, this book is tough going. I found it a good cure for my insomnia, as I could never manage more than a few pages without falling asleep... it was almost impossible to drag my eyes across the page, and this is coming from someone who gets a kick out of Finnegans Wake, and when suitably drunk can do all the Goon Show voices.Perhaps having a real editor would've helped string these ramblings together... a low point in the milligna body of work."
4,A different story,"The story of the book is very different from almost all the books that I have read and I have my own questions of the veracity of the facts when they happened 6 years before, but as I always say you read to have fun and you can't expect that everything written in a book is real.The story of any person in jail is depressing, and I think that is more depressing if that person was innocent no matter what other people think (outside of jail of course).The book is an easy book to read and is perfect for the beach or any vacations, because is not a turn pager but it keeps you reading, so if you have anything else to do you can stop reading any time."
4,Go Spoon,"Had a chance to see these guys at the E-town show they did in Boulder. I have to say, they're not the best interview, but man are they great to listen to. As a friend once said to me regarding their earlier Girls Can Tell release, ""This is a disc that I will listen to once, then it somehow it gets stuck in my CD player for a month."" Well, since mp3's have ruined that a bit, I don't know that this album will ever get the continuous play time the earlier releases did (having to get out the 30-disc case in your car, find a new CD, and then change discs made month long stints in the CD player MUCH more common). Either way, this release has songs that are going to find a good deal of radio play. You'll enjoy it, but definitely make sure you check out their earlier releases, particularly, Girls Can Tell and Kill the Moonlight."
3,Not as good as I was hoping,I bought this CD off of an Amazon recommendation and it wasn't great in my opinion. The music and lyrics were both fairly simple and unexciting - nothing melodic or deep. I know this isn't an extremely descriptive review but overall - sub par.
5,I really like it,"But the big question: What is on the bonus disc. This is from the comments:Brian Bonenberger says: Bonus Disc ""Get Nice""Tracklist:I Got MineBe Still My ServantLeave Your Effects Where They're Easily SeenI Summon You (Cool)Mean Mad MargaretLove Makes You FeelYou Got Yr. Cherry BombTasty FishDracula's Cigarette1975I Can Feel It Fade Like An AM SingleCurfew TollsThe disc is 22 minutes long and contains instrumentals, demos and alternate takes. The ""Cool"" version of ""I Summon You"" is great and makes the bonus disc worth it."
1,So. Ummmm. ?,"One guy came up to me and said that this album was so sweet. Spoons best. And I put it on. And listened to it.?It sounds like a bad REO Speedwagon album.But the kids must love it. I think.REO Speedwagon has not been on tour for a while...and they don't need to be, now that Spoon has released this boring album. Their older stuff ain't that bad either. It must be the record industry fueling the press to sell records. Like the new Modest mouse and stuff...they had sweet albums. But no press. Now they have wack albums and tons of press.Kind of like REO Speedwagon. Except they never had any good albums. Well...Tell that to a wagon-head and you'll get the same response you'd get from someone who is totally digging this new Spoon album.Is this where rock is at now?"
5,A Journey Back Home,"14 years ago, my partner and I got hooked on Northern Exposure in its 3rd season. We fell in love with the series and all of its characters. Imagine how excited we were to recieve the Parka Pack and revisit our old friends in episodes that we have never seen. Northern Exposure remains the most creative series ever produced on television. The episodes are as new and exciting and relevent as they were 15 years ago. They are truly a healing balm in a world that has gone crazy.I've just placed my order for the new 4th season DVD soon to be released.The Parka Pack is quite simply a bundle of magic."
1,Horrid Customer Service! BEWARE!,"Beware of Viewsonic Customer Service. I sent a LCD in for warranty repair, so far it's been 7 weeks with no repair/replacement in sight. Check out Planar LCD's if warranty service is important to you."
4,Just for Today/Emotions Anonymous,"This is the recommended daily reading for the 12-step, self help group, Emotions Anonymous. A must if you work the program; suggested reading for any who have emotional issues."
5,Great history,"Yes, there are some things missing but overall I would say this is a must have for fans of Dora Maar so that you can see her early influences as she worked for Man Ray, then later became enchanted with Picasso. I enjoyed stepping into the timeline of artist influence in this."
4,Overlooked philly-gems,"As it says in the booklet of this three(!)-disc compilation these three late 70 / early 80 records from The Stylistics are some of the most overlooked releases in all of the philly-soul catalogue.The sound found here is your typical late 70:ies slick and groovy soul (at times flirting with disco). What makes this record so interesting is that the material is not at all as cliché as other albums from this period can be, the songwriting comes of as fresh and creative and contain a lot of tracks that really have a unique feeling to them.If you're a fan of phillysoul or just late 70:ies soul than this compilation should not make you dissapointed. Personal favourites include ""Call on you"" and ""It started out""."
3,28 years to hear this one,"I've spent alot of my life listening to these guys. When I think about it, the Stylistics stoped me from listening to those Temptations, and that says alot. ""Hurry Up This Way Again"" was always one of my favorite albums, with alot of gems on it. ""1992, only for the true Stylistic fan ""you're leaving"" and ""United"" another couple of gems. What a great job they do on ""United"" (old ""Intruders"" classic) Now let me tell you about the one I never heard or heard about, ""closer than close"". If you're like me, it'll take awhile to get pass""almost there"", only then can you truly appreaciate the other tracks, ""closer than close"", ""mine all mine"" and ""serchin'"". You'll see how ""closer than close"" got lost in that disco era. Don't think that these guys didn't make money on disco also, you got to check there record sales in the UK, Asia and Europe."
5,Off the chain!,This CD took me back to the good ole days. . .Man. . .I put it on and just smiled. . . .People Make the world go round! They just dont make songs like this anymore. Guys if ya read this. . . .Thank you so much for this music!You'll never get to heaven If you Break my heart. . . .I just loved it. . .I downloaded it right into my Ipod!
4,Think before you get this guide,"First of all, think about if you should get this game. If you want to and do not mind the aged graphics amd you bought this game, then this is probably the best guide you can get for this game. With details on how to defeat every single boss and how rings work, you should have no problem beating this game."
2,Not much improvement,This gave my post laser surgery skin a very matte finish but really did not tone down redness in any noticeable way. It makes my skin appear dull.
3,Over Priced - Over Rated!,"The reviews on this book sounded so good, and the plot sounded interesting. Given the higher retail price for this paperback, I thought for sure it HAD to be a winner - WRONG. The book starts off with a ""bang"" and ends in a ""whimper."" It's not a bad book, but it certainly doesn't justify the glowing reviews or the higher price. I compare this book with a boring Harlequin. Save yourself some money...if you can't get this at your local library, just go to your local book store and read the first and last chapters. That's pretty much all this book has to offer. Such a let down. This same plot written by someone like Nora Roberts or Julie Garwood would have ROCKED!"
3,"Great start, disappointing end.","I flew through the first half of the book fascinated with the characters, the location and wondered where it would lead to. A dead end was the final destination. Nothing was resolved, justice was not mete out, confrontations that should have occurred did not and by the end of the novel I had nothing but contempt for all of the characters. Overall this book was a big disappointment. For a good book on Eastern Europe I would recommend Prague or the Russian Debutantes Handbook."
5,leon degrelle,There's not much I can add to what the other reviewers have written. They don't make them like Degrelle any more. His personal life is an example to anyone. He was one of many who wished and believed that they could make a better Europe and struggled mightily to that end. Whatever ones political outlook one cannot doubt the courage and conviction of Degrelle or the men he led. That he survived so much carnage and the vengence of his enemies at the end is remarkable. That he then went on to build a successful life for himself and his family in exile in Spain and produce such a memorable account of his experiences we should be thankful for. The book stays with the subject after a brief introduction about the author's background. The experiences of the Wallonians begins in 1942 and ends with Degrelle and two survivors in May 1945. It was an epic struggle by any standards and is related skillfully by an accomplished writer.
4,"Walkthrough lacking, but additional info is TERRIFIC!","Being a web author of cluebooks myself, I found the Walkthrough section EXTREMELY lacking. It explains the most obvious things that a player could have easily figured out him/herself, but is very lacking on the specific areas where most players get stuck. On the other hand, the background info for the game, items lists, and character creation info is GREAT! The 48 page interview with Richard Garriott at the end is pretty interesting, too. For the die-hard Ultima fan, or someone looking for a handy reference to the game, this book is an absolute must-have. But, if you're just looking for solutions to the game, much better help is to be found by searching on the Net!"
1,Not as expected,"You are constantly referred to his website www.lowcarboptions.com to obtain what brand names of vitamins, minerals, food, etc. that he recommends. Once you get there it is just 3 products and his own version of vitamins and minerals; plus the expense of becoming a member, but for what? A few coupons on products he refuses to mention?"
2,Thought provoking....but tiring.,"This book presented some decent ideas which would help people or businesses 'in a rut' see new ways of doing things. The book was tiresome to read because Ms. Sanders writes 'down' to her readers, much like she was writing to an audience of children. In addition, she is obviously an inside-the-beltway leftist which was another distraction throughout the book. It is fascinating that she can have grasp of complexity and adaptive systems, but not be able to see that the U.S.S.R. failed precisely because it lacked the primary ingredient of complex adaptive systems, namely freedom to innovate. Overall, this book had 10 pages of good information and 150 pages of fluff."
2,Disappointing but some gems,"This book was a bad concept from the start. The presumption of Carson, or the King Estate, or whomever, to create a book cut & paste style is a little distasteful. However, within these pages there are a few precious pieces, due in every way to King himself, not to this book or its creators. Perhaps it may serve as a good introduction to King for those who haven't had much exposure to him. Or better yet, go buy a book he really DID write."
1,Gibbon did it better,"This book is warmed over Gibbon. The thesis of the book can be best summed up as nasty Christians and their squabbles led to the Dark Ages and the eclipse of reason for a thousand years. Gibbon had the same argument and delivered it with a style, alas, that Mr. Freeman does not approach. Of course the thesis is completely wrong. The ancient world was in an intellectual dead end long before Christianity came on the scene. It was the much maligned Middle Ages that produced the intellectual trends that led humanity, for better and worse, to surpass in many ways the intellectual accomplishments of the ancient world. This book represents history on a comic book level, and contains a fair amount of Christian bashing. Polemics make poor history."
2,Scratchboard product,"As far as the professional response from the company goes, it would rate five stars. The product was very well packaged, and delivery was quite rapid. The cost was small enough that no one is going to get very bruised. However, I thought the product was really really poor. So bad, in fact, I placed 11 of the 12 sheets in the garbage, completely untouched. They are so thin that they are effectively unworkable as a ""scratch"" media. I ended up making my own scratchboard by applying two coats of dry wall mud over plywood, sanding the surface smooth, and painting black ink over the surface. This worked magnificantly... But it is alot of work."
3,okay,I thought the sheets would have been thicker. but overall i am okay with the purchase. Should have been a bit cheaper for just some paper
4,"wonderful singing, some strange staging","I am not a great fan of Rossini, but I love Renee Fleming. I heard the Met broadcast of this opera and loved it. The music actually changed my opinion of Rossini. I bought the DVD out of curiosity to see the production. I found some of the choreography, costumes and sets actually distracting - a little too much Broadway glitz. In spite of that, it tells a wonderful story and Fleming and Brownlee are superb. I highly recommend it."
3,fifteen dollars value,"It's a cheap iron, very small and does not hold much hair. It took awhile to straighten my short hair. Did not seem to get very hot. I only used it a few times and then forgot it at my friend's house one weekend and I do not miss it. Fifteen bucks.. twenty with shipping. Tried the curling thing and it just didn't hold. Maybe with more patience I would have had more success but I refuse to ration so much brain power to straightening my hair."
5,best series,"this is the best series since firefly...the characters, the writing, it is very entertaining. this episode is one that really confirms what a good man and agent booth is"
1,Very Unhappy,"The DVD you shipped is misssing the first 4 episodes of episodes of this Season Four. The DVD begins with ""The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond"" but does not have:1. Yanks in the UK (1)2. Yanks in the UK (2)3. Man in the Outhouse4. The Finger in the NestI Called and you replaced the DVD with a DVD that was identical, also missing these four episodes. I called and the customer service rep had no answers.What do I do now?"
5,bones season 4,bones is one of my wifes and my favorite series will buy every dvd season they make it goes with all the time in our R.V.
4,"Fourth Season, better than I'd remembered","I came very close to not purchasing this dvd. The last episode of the season struck me as a disappointment, and a few of the later episodes seemed entirely too glib for my taste.Having viewed the entire season once again, there's more to love here than I'd remembered.This season was actually longer than typical, the first few episodes of the year are actually on the season 3 dvd, and since they serve to wrap up that season's major story line, it works nicely, but the episodes in the season 4 set do make a coherent arc of their own.Editing to add: This set doesn't have a separate menu for scene selection. Not a huge problem, but I did notice the lack of it, which seems to indicate it's a feature I like to use."
3,Just wish they were cheaper,"I bought 3 of them and would like to have 5-6 more but I'll have to wait for the price to come down. I mean, come on; these must only cost $2-3 to make, right?"
3,Some Good Information But Not Enough Depth,Personally I think I'll order Mr.Murphy's book on Intermarket Analysisas I suspect it better covers the topic.
5,"Don't just read ""The Bear""!!!!","Please, please do not pass over the other fine stories in GO DOWN, MOSES and go straight to ""The Bear."" This gem means much more when illuminated by the other parts of the text, and only by reading the entire book can you fully understand the meaning of Ike's repudiation of the McCaslin land. I recently completed a Faulkner course, and of all of his ""genius"" novels--""As I Lay Dying,"" ""Light in August,"" ""Go Down, Moses,"" ""The Sound and the Fury,"" and ""Absalom! Absalom!""--I believe that this one has the strongest emotional core. Read the whole thing; your experience will be much richer."
5,"""You ain't looked right yet""","Go Down Moses is by far Faulkner's greatest piece. It is the most accessible of his works and contains some of the most beautiful prose of American literature. The implications that Faulkner suggests throughout the book are that we must refocus our minds, hearts and eyes to see the brotherhood of ""communal anonymity.""Faulkner's piece is arguably the most beautiful works of American literatrue. Go Down Moses is a must for all people who believe in hope, justice, and love."
5,hillarious show,hillarious show.why wouldn't you buy this.all the seasons are great.do not eat.all aspects of transaction were satisfactory.
5,Word on the street...,"I've heard September 18, 2009 as a release date. Not sure it's reliable info, but it's the only date I've run into so far."
2,Meh....,"This burner was bought as part of an outdoor homebrewing project. At first, it looked like it would do the job. However, it's a pain to light. It took many tries, and was just generally a pain. However, that's not the worst part. The paint on the stand and the spreader plate charred and flaked off, some of which landed in our beer!!! This was absolutely ridiculous, and if I could return it, I probably would. I will never purchase this brand again."
1,Returned the item,When I got the product I was very disappointed in how the burner mechanism worked. The hose hooked to a tube that had a brass fitting on the end with a small hole in it that the flame came out of. The brass fitting was not secure so the flame could have been directed i any direction. It should have been locked in place so the flame would go straight up the tube to the deflector. I returned this item and bought a cooker from Sam's Club that has an actual burner.
3,a little puzzled,The problems I have with this product is the first being that the book of directions had nothing to do with my model.Even the shape was different. Also the adjusting screw to adjust how the fan spreads the flame snapped off the first time I tried to adjust. Tho the price was reasonable so its OK.
4,Great burner!,"Works like a champ! Very hot flame is perfect for stir-frying! I have not tried it yet for boiling water or deep frying, but i'm sure it would heat up oil/water super fast!"
1,"Looked good, but broke right away","I was looking for a belt to replace the belt that had served me faithfully for years. I picked out several. This one looked good and I ordered it. Within an hour of receiving it, one of the ""laces"" broke. I ended up buying a similar design, but much more expensive belt that I'm now wearing - and hope to for years to come. I think the Lee belt was just too ""cheap""."
4,Good CD - but don't buy it if you want to play it on a PC,This CD is PC copy protected! I would have returned mine but I found out too late!
2,Choose Another Lindsey Book,"The characters in this book are interesting, but a little hard to believe. The main character, Lady Katherine, is kidnapped, drugged and basically assaulted by her admirer, a Russian Prince. Yet she amazingly overcomes this, and the fact that she is kept as a slave and is beaten by his aunt. It is trying to be a love conquers all sort of novel, but I personally don't think it conquers the stupidity and lack of human decency of the ""hero."" Even when you try to shroud it in aphrodisiacs, it is still really what it is."
3,Its great if you take out the drugging/violent aspects of it,"I really enjoyed the romance between Katharine and Dimitri. However, I was very disturbed about her being drugged and getting whipped. I really felt for her, but then I was also mad at her, because she handled everything badly. The first time she was drugged, she should've just told him the whole story, scandal be damned. Katharine was supposed to be a really smart individual, but I was just shaking my head at the actions she took. Also, she forgave him WAY too easily!!!! Dimitri needed to suffer in my eyes, as well as his ""aunt"" who had her whipped."
4,"Good job, JL!","This was another typical, wonderful JL book. Though neither Katherine or Dimitri were my personal favorites, the story was hot!"
2,Never worn,"I ordered the coat because it was a Pendleton and knew I could be assured of the quality. I was very pleased with the coat when I saw it. However, the zipper did not work properly -- it did not line up properly at the bottom and trying to close it was scary. Unfortunately, I had to return the coat."
3,NOT FOR BACKPACKERS!,"Love, love, love the pictures of the places, the people and (yum) the foods of each region. However, the book isn't really comprehensive and reviews mostly ""high end"" places (whether it's restaurant or hotels) that I personally found not affordable. In other words, if you've got a pretty large budget, this is the book for you. But if you're a backpacker kinda traveller, stay away!"
3,Italy (Eyewitness Travel Guides),"Very comprehensive travel guide. Perhaps a little too comprehensive... small print and very heavy. Good for reading at home before you go, not to carry around while touring."
4,Good introduction but can be better,"I traveled to Italy from Jan 3 to Jan 13 2002.This book does bring me a lot of information about the history of Italy and the famous article in each museum.With this book, I enjoy my travel a lot.To travel alone, the book gives me less information.I have no idea about how to take how to buy the metro ticket in Milan and also the require regulation about it.Also the information about buying the train ticket is a bit old.If you wish to travel with this book.You can enjoy your culture journey but must pay more attention about how to use public transportation."
3,Good for Rome; not very good for Amalfi Coast.,I thought the book was excellent until I went to the Amalfi Coast. All the info. that I was expecting was not there. I was disappointed and would recommend that future editions become as in depth as the more popular cities/towns in Italy.
3,Looks good but not comfortable,Could not beat the price for this good looking watch. Battery already dead and needs tool to replace. Band was way too long but after I cut it the keeper will not stay on. I will be buying a new band when I replace the battery. Once I do this the overall cost will be about the same. Always pay attention to the reviews both pro and con. They were right on with my experience.
1,Junk,Remote control operation either never worked or would work sporadically. Equipment does not seem to be able to work manually when the remote or other electronics are not working. Very frustrating as well because instructions have no troubleshooting information. They assume it will work first time and every time. This was a total waste of time.
1,misleading description,"I had a rude awakening when my tortillas arrived with all the nifty ""gourmet"" and ""organic"" packaging, but the ingredient list was chock full of preservatives. I suppose I should have looked for the ""100% natural"" label. However, in my defense, I must say I was drawn in by their claims of organic pesticide-free flour etc.These tortillas taste fine, and if you don't care about preservatives in your food, eat away! However, if you are looking for all natural, preservative-free tortillas, go someplace else."
5,Perfection on Perfection,"""Berlin"" is one of the most depressing albums of all time, along with Neil Young's ""Tonight's The Night"" and ""Faith"" by The Cure. Seeing and hearing ""Berlin"" performed live makes the album even better. And, Antony singing ""Candy Says"" with Lou for the encore is priceless. It's no surprise that ""Berlin"" was panned in '73. Like modern classical music, it takes time for its genius to sink in. Lou's age and life experience also makes this a powerful performance. He was still a young man in '73. 35 years later, these songs take on a whole new level of pathos, terror and brilliance."
3,Missing Detail,"Book is written well and easy to understand; however, it is not written for those persons who are wanting to learn the basics of using Backup Exec - it omits much of the details."
1,Disappointment of the Year,"This is clearly the biggest disappointment of the year. I'be been waiting for this album to come out for some time, and when I finally got to listen to it, I found that it was pure crap. They lost any kind of ""edge,"" I guess, they had on the first album. ""And Don't Forget To Breathe"" was absolutely amazing, and I was hoping for something along those lines for this new album. Absolutely not. It sounds like every other crap-band, and every song sounds like it was geared specifically for commercial radio.Thankfully, I work at a college radio station so I got to listen to this thing without having to pay for it.Avoid at all costs, but pick up the previous album."
5,Awesome Series!!!,"Breaking Bad the Fourth Season arrived just in time before season five starts on July 15th. I started watching this series a little later but am all caught up now, probably the greatest television series I have ever seen and it just gets better every season. It will be sad when season five ends but will be very interesting to see how they wrap everything up. Thumbs way up to Vince Gilligan all the actors and crew for creating this fantastic series!!!*****"
5,Breaking Bad Season 4,"This is a must see for anyone who has followed the series. Not sure what season 5 will bring, but will be hard to top season 4. Excellent!"
5,Breaking Bad,"After watching the first 4 seasons, I convinced my skeptical son to take a look. He watched all 4 seasons in 2 days. This is the absolute best tv show I have ever seen, and I've been around awhile. If you haven't watched it, start with Season 1, of course. It's so addictive, I can't wait for another season to start. I want to see when Jesse finds out Walt was at his house the night Jane died (spoiler!)."
5,Breaking Bad Season 4,"I could not be more pleased with my purchase of ""Breaking Bad"" season 4 in HD streaming on Amazon.com I have watched the entire series online thru season 3 on Netflix, and was disappointed that season 4 was not available. It was only available on Amazon. I was able to order and watch in HD quality within an hour. Thank you for this service. E."
5,Great,This show has always been great and continues to be with it's newest season four. Bryan Cranston is great to watch as well.
2,"If I could, I would ask for my money back",Same old same old. I must be missing the whole point of the episode because I guess I was supposed to be worried that Jessee might be finally killed. I wasn't. Its too transparent at this point. I wish they'd kill off Jessee and Skyler and get on with it.
2,The fly,"I really like this show ,but the fly episode was boring, nothing to do with the rest of the show."
5,incredible,"First of all, you must watch seasons 1-3 for the build-up to this. It's truly amazing to see how the pace, pulse, & explosion of writing take you through into season 4. Every episode will stun you, catch you off guard, & sometimes leave you breathless as to the complete insanity one man can get his life into. The actors are second to none. Bryan Cranston will win more awards, as will the supporting cast in this show. There are not enough words as to how much I recommend watching this show. Quality like this is just too rare nowadays."
3,Part of my childhood,"Although the pictures are nice. This was more memorable because of the cover, itself. I received this at an extremely early age, originally, so not much here to trigger any special memories. But nice book."
2,Against All Odds,"I purchased this title thinking it was a suitable read for adults. What I received was a book suited more for youngsters. More importantly I expected to read authentic, documented accounts of pioneer survival (definitely the impression given in the description). I was disappointed to find the book is actually a collection of fictionalized accounts of Mormon experiences. At the end of each story the author deploys a few sparse sentences to indicate the actual events that sparked her imagination - definitely not what I expected or wanted. The author has storytelling talent and therefore the book might be enjoyable for young adults interested in historic Mormon fiction, however I found it frustrating."
2,Doesn't fit,"I bought this for a Savage 111 30.06 without Accutrigger, which the description says it fits. Both mounting locations on my gun are rounded, but the rail has a flat rear mount so it doesn't fit the gun. I'd be angry but I only paid $11. Don't buy if both your rail mounting areas are rounded!"
3,Rail bends on Model 111 when screwed down completely.,"I ordered this Weaver Base after doing some searching and checking and checking again to make sure it was going to be exactly what I was looking for because the picture is the wrong one. Its actually a one piece base and it was exactly what I wanted. However, I've found an issue with this base. Its notched out on one end making the scope angle down and it angles down so much that when using a bore sight you can't see the laser threw the scope and you can see the rail bending when screwed down completely. The screws matched up perfectly, however, it won't work on the Model 111 which it specifies its for."
3,Just Okay,This video is just alright. My children like it as much as they like everything Barney related. It's a bit too short.
2,Rosemary's Baby meets Priests from Hell,"The subject of this book is attention getting, if nothing else. This book displays the evil imagination of James Patterson at its fullest. I found far too much of it annoying in that it was difficult to tell what was real vs. what was only imagined by the characters. The ending was no surprise to me, although Mr Patterson certainly intended it to be. I also found the character flaws of the eventual virgin to be unfitting with the story line. This one is not for the faint of heart, and I'm sure many Roman Catholics are offended by it."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing,"This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in years. James Patterson is a talented writer, so I plodded on and on in the belief that this horrible book would improve. It didn't."
1,Very Very Strange,"I was so disappointed in this book. What a waste of money and time. Very flat, one-dimensional characters. I can't believe I even bothered to finish it."
1,THIS BOOK IS A JOKE!,"THIS BOOK IS A JOKE -- A JOKE ON US. THE WRITING IS AWFUL, THE PLOT IS DUMB AND CONFUSED, AND THE CHARACTERS CAME OUT OF A COMIC BOOK. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS AUTHOR IS A BEST-SELLER. THE COUNTRY MUST REALLY BE DUMBING DOWN.TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THIS IS A REHASH OF AN EARLIER PATTERSON BOOK CALLED VIRGIN, AND THERE'S NO NOTICE OF THIS IN THE BOOK ITSELF (ONLY A SMALL NOTICE ON THE DUST JACKET) -- ISN'T THIS AGAINST THE LAW? MAYBE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CONSUMER RIP-OFF. PUBLISHER, AUTHOR, AND EDITOR SHOULD BE ASHAMED.END"
4,Book based on SUPERNATURAL stuff..............if u accept that than this book can be very very enjoyable...,"OK first off i had very low expextations for this book....well from the very first few chapters I accepted the fact that this book would be Supernatural.......away from Reality.........this book reminded me of the movie Rosemary's baby a lot........reading this book i could litreally see the scenes up in my head........it was fast and filled with SUSPENSE....well it seems many peoeple hated it because they were expecting a LOGICAL reasoning behind everything....but alas this aint tht kind of book........WEll i have read ""You've been Warned"" so i know better...anyways just loved the ending...it was out of nowhere........HUMMm this could have been a very good series.......the ending was very promising..........all in all a GOOD thrilling read............"
4,Suspenseful,"I really enjoyed the book, it's a real page turner. The overall story though, was a bit brief."
2,Expected more from such a talented author,"I started this book with high hopes, and the first few chapters seemed truly engrossing, but as the chapters flew by I grew more and more annoyed with the plot -- despite the ""breakneck pace"" there wasn't much of a plot to move along. A few random violent deaths thrown in here and there don't necessarily mean good absorbing action. There are too many incongruities, and the outcome leaves you with a feeling of ""That's it? Come on, there has to be more to this."" Even the subplots seem forced and/or too convenient. If this author has matured enough to rewrite one of his earlier novels to show his maturation as a writer, this seems to be a half-hearted effort. Patterson is capable of a lot more than this."
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I consider myself a huge Patterson fan, however, after reading Cradle and All, I am losing faith. Regretfully, I didn't read these reviews until AFTER reading the book, or I wouldn't have wasted my time. On a more positive note, I am glad to see that this was a reworking of an earlier novel. It actually gives me hope that the next Alex Cross novel will be back up to par. I don't know what Patterson was thinking, between this one and When The Wind Blows, was he trying to be Dean Koontz or something? Even if his future books have his traditional 'nursery rhyme' titles, if they are not about Cross, and if the chapters are not more involved than two pages, I'm not going to bother."
1,Stick to what your good at!,"A Pop Goes the Weasel, Cat & Mouse, Jack & Jill etc...it is not. He ventured off the beaten path and, in my opinion, fell off the cliff. Compared to his other books, I would rate this a 0."
1,rip-off,"This one star is generous. Next time, I'll keep my debit card in my wallet. This book was so badly written and a complete waste of a wonderful concept. There were sloppy errors in detail and zero meaningful background information about the characters; the relationships were cliches; the descriptions were inadequate; the scenes were ho-hum predictable. It was written in eighth grade style with stultifying sentence structure, flat verbs, and way too many adverbs. And those sound bite chapters stretched a 250 page book to a bare 300. Rip off! When an author lets his publisher promote this kind of second rate effort, it is an insult to his readers. I won't buy James Patterson again without reading strong reviews first."
2,A rerun...,"As I was reading this book, I kept getting the feeling I had read this before. In fact, it was driving me nuts. I finally realized I read this story 20 years ago. I re-checked the paper cover and saw a small insert about this book being a remake of ""Virgin."" Geez...do all prominent authors write reruns and get full price? The story was interesting, but knowing 95% of the ending made the ""thriller"" seem boring."
2,Who knew the end of the world would be so boring?,"I am a huge fan of James Patterson and try and read as many books by him as I can. I will admit that he has certainly written worse books then this but this was incredibly dull. The characters are laughable, the plot is easily stretched out, and the whole novel is just kind of boring. The book kept my interest and it kept me turning pages but I was doing it more to rush through the whole book then anything. I wanted to like this book but it boils itself down in way too much religious blasphemy which kept me rolling my eyes. Despite how dull and lifeless the whole book in general is, it's nowhere near as abysmal as Last Warning. This book is on par with the Quickie with being a time waster."
4,Excellent! Jana M. Chicago IL,"From the title i assumed it would have been a typical drama about lovers and babies,but it was far better than expected. With the turn over every page I was more interested. It had depth,religion and good old fashion mystery to it. a excellent read!"
3,Not one of his best....,"I'm a big fan of Patterson's novels up to the present, but this, to me, isn't as good as previous novels. Two dimensional characters, an unoriginal idea, and a topic I didn't find that spine tingling made this book just a little substandard. Any other novelist rather than Patterson and this definately would have been a 1 star novel. Here's hoping that the future finds Patterson with a few better ideas that hearken back to the Along Came A Spider days."
1,Not Your Typical Patterson,"I've read all of the Patterson novels to date and have been very diappointed with two of his most recent ones: Cradle And All, and When The Wind Blows. They are just too far fetched. Maybe he just fails to make it believable. In Cradle, the details are fairly skimpy and he could have spent more time developing certain parts to make the novel seem more believable. Seems like he gets caught up with keeping his chapters to 2 pages regardless of whether he gets his points accross. I'm looking forward to the next Cross novel."
1,Trite,"I hate to say it, but this book is a bunch of hogwash. It is trite, unbelievable, and poorly written. Don't waste your time with this. It's pretty awful!!"
1,Not up to standards,"I like James Patterson and eagerly await his new releases. I ordered this on audio cassette (unabridged) and truly thought it would never end. The characters were not believable and the storyline was absurd. Really, I should have just gone to tape 14 to see how it ended and saved myself the torture! Don't waste your time. Hope his next one is back to his usual page-turner."
3,Virgins,"""Cradle and All"" is new waters for Patterson. The book is a thriller like his books in the past. There seem to be problems all over the world that make people ask ""Is The End Near?"" Among these problems there are two women that find themselves with child that are virgins. These women must be protected above all else. I always enjoy Patterson's books but this plot is not to my taste. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
1,I will be throwing out this book,"I don't know why I continued reading the book except that I thought somewhere Patterson would find some redeeming features--not so. The book was far fetched with all the tragedies of the world, the pregnant virgins, the devil's voices, etc. Don't waster your time on this one."
2,"Check out ""Child of Darkness - Child of Light""","When I first read the book, I thought this story line sure sounds familiar, and as I go on reading, there's just a similarity of a tv-movie called ""Child of Darkness-Child of Light"", an 1991 USA tv-movie starring Sela Ward. It might not be of the same scenes but it sure have the same story line along the way. Even at the end of the story, it's almost have the same ending except the ages of both children. Otherwise, it's a page-turner alright."
2,Really didn't like this book........,I was very disappointed in this book. James Patterson writes books that are interesting to read but Cradle and All was just a take-off on an old black and white movie I saw. I knew what was going to happen throughout the whole book except the very end. Too bad to waste Patterson's talents.
1,ZERO STARS,"I could not read pass 15 pages. The premise is interesting and has been done before by writers who are not as popular as Patterson. Unfortunately, Patterson's storytelling has suffered. I was not hooked at all. The character development lacks and his metaphors are obvious. I'm glad this was a library book and not one I purchased."
1,Don't bother,"Even if you have not read Virgin, this remake is not worth the time. I've enjoyed many other Patterson books. Not this one."
2,disappointing,"I am a big fan of James Patterson (especially the Alex Cross series). However, this book was a let down. It started off well, but then the ending just fell apart and ruined the story."
3,Different and exciting,"I am a big fan of James Patterson. He may very well be my favorite author. With that said this book is not much diffrent than anything else he ever wrote. Mr. Patterson is into suspense and lack of character development and plausible plot lines are his norm. This novel did have the same ""norms"" but it reads so fast and as someone not Catholic I found it to be a scary look at the Church. I can see where a devout catholic would be offended but get over it is a novel.Overall, the book has more unanswered questions than ever but nobody is going to guess the ending and that is only the question that needs to be answered. Its fun and worth the two days maximum it will take to read, I still miss Alex though."
2,"Cradle doesn't ""Rock""","If you liked When The Wind Blows, you might enjoy Cradle Will Rock; but if you are a fan of Alex Cross, you will probably be even more disappointed than you think. Like all of Patterson's work, it is fast paced, and hard to put down; but it seemed to me, he was ""just going through the motions"". It read more like a screenplay than a novel - waiting for actors and actresses to fill out the characters. His work always seems to be ""Literature Lite""; but this goes a little too far down the path toward comic book reality, for my taste."
3,Not great not horrible,I have read most of Pattersons work and I find that Cradle and All was definately not his best work. I get sucked into all his books like I did this one but it was more predictable than anything else hes written. I give it a solid C
5,A Must Read,"Any book by James Patterson is a definite MUST READ! To the very end, I thought it had to be either one of the two girls... Freaky twists and turns caught my total attention. I can't wait until the sequel about Noelle..."
1,"Do what you best, Mr P. This is pap...","I am about 120 pages into this purported novel and find it difficult to class it anything other than ""stinker"". It is a light weight, superficial attempt to cross over to the occult, bump in the night world of King et al. It's virgin birth thread coupled with two page chapters make it laughable (if I could only forget that I spent good money for this book).Save your money and invest it in Sandford's new ""Easy Prey"" or Deaver's ""The Empty Chair""."
1,"Disappointing ""Rosemary's Baby"" wannabe!","James Patterson's books have always been a pleasure to read - until this one. I, unfortunately, assumed it would be like his other novels - even without Alex Delaware - and nothing could be further from the truth!"
1,Unbelievably bad,"This book is truly AWFUL! I have enjoyed other books by the author, so I am not prejudiced against him. I understand that this book is a re-write of an earlier work; I can certainly believe this. Without giving away the plot, this book concerns the concept of a virgin birth, as in the Bible. To those who do not believe in this concept, the book is ridiculous. To those who do believe in the Biblical story, particularly those who believe literally, the story is offensive. That leaves almost no one who should like this book. I sincerely hope that the author goes back to Alex Cross."
2,I Couldn't Enjoy It,"This one had a fairly interesting plot, with a couple of great twists. The characters weren't that well developed though.I tried to take this one in with an open mind, and the knowledge that it was a work of fiction. BUT, it went totally against my Christian beliefs in so many parts that I couldn't even enjoy it."
1,This doesn't even deserve 1/8th of a star,"What the hell was this?I really loved anything by James Patterson, but this has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The opening prologue was good - two young virgins pregnant and about to give birth, both saying the births will be miracle births..but that is about as believable and interesting as the story gets!I have to admit that I love the fact that Patterson writes very short chapters, if it wasn't for that, I would have dumped the book ages ago so I actually did finish it within a couple of hours, but it was a terrible book. The plot was pathetic, the characters were wooden and very silly and overall, I was very very very disappointed with this lastest book from Patterson.If you a big Alex Cross fan or just love anything from JP, leave this book on the shelf and if you want good vs evil, get Stephen King!"
1,What a Waste of Time,"The ""Cradle and All"" is not the only thing that has fallen with this book. The standard of writing has tumbled down into new depths. This is easily the most poorly written book I have been unfortunate enough to read in many years. The writing makes Sidney Sheldon look like Shakespeare. The plot is not just unbelievable, but ridiculous. I had to finish reading this book to see if it would end as badly, but I was a bit disappointed. It ended worse than I could have even imagined."
2,A disppointment for Patterson fans,"I didn't know this book was a re-working of Virgin until after I'd read it, but it shows some of the shallowness encountered in a popular author's early works. I am a fan of the Alex Cross novels, and I knew this book did not have the Cross character in it, but I wanted to read it anyway. I was disappointed. This book seemed very much like a meet-the-publisher's-contract-quota book. The characters are undeveloped, and there are gaps in the story that are unexplained. I found chapter-ending dilemmas that were not resolved. I was carried along, but skeptical at the same time. For that reason, I gave it two (instead of one) stars. All-in-all, not a book I would recommend to readers accustomed to Patterson's quality of writing."
1,Cradle and all,"What was he smoking when he wrote this one? I gave it one star, but I'm still not sure why.Don't waste your time, money or effort."
3,olympus 760,"Its a good camera, their are better cameras out there, however not with weather protection. It sacrifices top quality for protection."
3,"Words, words, and more words","Not to sound hard, but a novel should stand on its own merits despite the afflictions ot the author. There is a wonderful story hidden in the purple prose. These characters could have been so incredibly moving if only Christopher Nolan had not been in love with words--and often the wrong ones. When he gets more deeply into the story, his style becomes more lilting and descriptive--the rest of the time, the language gets in the way of the story and real communication. At times, I moaned aloud at the ridiculous overuse of words just to use words, and yet, I did love Minnie and her love for her land. I would have liked to have heard more from her--the earthy, honest woman--and less from the author."
3,GOOD COMPANY,"This is inoffensive light jazz, perfect driving music and great for casual atmospheres at home. There are some big jazz names here; Sonny Rollins, Charlie Hunter, and Lanie Kazan contribute pieces from their repertoire but all fourteen tracks are accomplished mainstream American jazz numbers sure to put you in pleasant spirits."
4,Blackfoot still rocks even without Medlocke!,Blackfoot is one of the greatest forgottensouthern rock bands of all times! The musicis still as great today even though thisisn't the original lineup! The two newguitarist can't replace Medlocke but theydo a great job & the band is smoking! Ididn't think possible to like this withoutMedlocke or Spiers but I have to say if youra Blackfoot or rock fan this is a great show!
1,"""A total waste of time & money""","The novel ""Coming of Age"", written by a black 18 year old, tries to give an impression about white/black/light-black problems. It tries to use a black slang for the black characters. This ,however, is a total failure, because it isn't real slang, nor is it normal language. This makes the language boring.The story isn't very interesting or complex: A black snob, Ruthie, realizes she loves a black athlete, AJ, and, to be sure that she keeps him, tries to destroy his ex-girlfriend, Erika, emotionally. Reading the book, it seemed that Ruthie is the ""perfect"" model of a student: hard-working, is in the Student Council, gets a scholarship, is the smartest, and makes everyone love school. The book bored me so much, that I didn't even finish reading it, even thought, we had to finish it for school (that's the first time I didn't finish a book that I started to read). A very disappointing book, and a total waste of time & money."
2,Distracting historical inaccuracies,The author should do a lot more research into the Regency period before she attempts such a novel. I find the historical inaccuracies very distracting (to put it mildly). Some examples: Noblemen of that period did not earn their living through trade. They were the landed gentry class and derived their wealth from their landholdings & estates. Anastasia was refered to a number of times as Mrs Damen Lockewood when she should in fact have been addressed as the Marchioness of Sheldrake. Ms Kane is also obviously not conversant with the mode and speed of travelling in those times. How can the villian who is in Kent and his informer who lives in London meet on such a regular basis late at night when the informer has to be back in his office by the next morning? These irritatating inaccuracies have spoilt my enjoyment of an otherwise interesting story.
2,Not my cup of tea,"I found this book disappointing regarding the romance aspect. I will give the author the benefit of the doubt seeing as how this is the first novel I've read from her, but overall, this one did not hold my interest. I found myself skipping pages throughout the whole thing. Almost too much intrigue that I couldn't keep up with, and really, didn't want too. The characters didn't grab me either."
5,Mardi Gras hit,Mardi Grais takes on new meaning when you know the history and importance of the places and people of old New Orleans. This pocket size handy guide helps one come away with a sense of the importance of this place in our American history.
4,Excellent Hair Product,"my stylist uses this product on my hair, I pay her $50 every two weeks. So, I bought this and flat iron my own hair and now save $100 a month on a $30 Iron."
5,excellent choice for the office,"EVERYONE IN OUR OFFICE LIKES THIS PRODUCT. THE SPACES ARE LARGEWITH ENOUGH LINES TO RECORD A VARIETY OF INFORMATION. WE ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE FLIP OVER PAGES, NOTHING IS LOST BY HAVING TO TEAR OFF EACH MONTHS PAGE.AN EXCELLENT CHOICE FOR HOME OR OFFICE"
3,Tortured Souls,"Although this was a good murder mystery, I found this book hard to read because the characters were all so depressing. Everyone had such gut wretching pasts and secrets. No one was happy and everyone was either guilt ridden or angry. I have read every book Penelope Williamson has written, but something in her personal life must be going on. Each new book seems to get darker. I will seriously consider buying her next book."
2,What my hair needs is more heat...,"This is a great product for someone who doesn't have coarse hair such as myself. I felt that the product could have been much hotter than it was. Overall, its good to use when you need something to get you by until you hit the salon."
2,Not comparible to a regular hot comb :(,"The combs are too far spread apart and although it's ""adjustable"", the black button you have to hold down does not lock the adjustment in so it wavers as you do your hair. I would not purchase this product again because I am an African American woman and this comb does not work well for me, as I need to get concentrated heat down close to my scalp."
4,Great old pictures,"The book has awesome pictures. The book review tells the facts about the book. Although most pictures where from before my time, it was very interesting to see how the city has changed over the years."
1,iListen does not run on Mac OS X 10.3.9,Just an awful product.Go through all the training and then the damn thing wont load. It givs you a kern_protection-error which is absolutely indecipherable. Probably the single worst product I have ever purchased.
5,Progressive epic masterpiece,"Simplemente apoteótico. Cuando Symphony sacó su disco V, el cual me encantó, me preguntaba dónde irían después. Creo que la respuesta está en el nuevo disco ""The odyssey"". Confirmé mis afirmaciones sobre cada uno de los músicos. Tanto Russell, del cual se escucha una nueva faceta, con latigazos de voz nunca antes escuchados, un estilo distinto al que veníamos escuchando en discos anteriores, como Romeo (guitarra), no podría decir nada, ya que cada nota es perfecta...Para terminar, sólo me resta decir que el tema ""The odyssey"" es una obra maestra... simplemente excelente. Hacer un tema de 24 minutos que no aburra al oyentes es digno de músicos realmente talentosos."
1,Not enough specifications,"This memory seemingly meets the specifications to be suitable for current Apple G5 Macintosh computers. Such is not the case. It requires 2.6 volts, not listed anywhere by Amazon, while Apple compliant memory works on 2.5 volts."
5,How to Eat for Life: A Doctor's View of Diet,"This is probably the most comprehensive review of how our diet affects our life that I have ever encountered.The authors have presented their case in an easy to read, yet fully detailed and referenced, book that should be mandatory reading for every person that cares about their health. The basics of human physiology and how we have evolved from our paleolithic ""hunter gatherer's"" diet to a modern ""agricultural"" diet are contrasted throughout.The examples are clear, concise, and follow basic logic. The dietary lifestyle that they recommend is simple, easy to follow, and filled with great health benefits. Their simple plan, and the 5 nutritional supplements (Vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, Vitamin C, Magnesium and coenzyme Q10)they recommend, should reshape the FDA's view of the food pyramid!"
5,A Great and Unexpected Project from Rich Mullins,"Rich Mullins' song cycle features an expanded Ragamuffins line-up on a project he believed very strongly in. There are a few breathtaking songs on here, fantastic performances and a fascinating story line. Hard to find, independently released. If you don't have this you should get it. Enjoy (and contemplate the content)."
5,Very good,"The book arrived quickly and in the condition that was specified. No issues, would use this seller again."
5,They fixed the random/shuffle mode play bug! Great!,They came out with a firmware upgrade and everything works cool now after they fixed the random/shuffle mode playing bug. This is a must for any gadget-freek and music lover. Go ARCHOS!
4,"a clear, simple and artistic look at golf basics.","I enjoyed reading the book and using the visual keys to help reinforce what I had read. Barbara and Jim have made an enjoyable golf read that doesn't bog down the mind. After reading the book, I went out and used the keys they suggested...they work!!..and its so simple..study the basics...study the basics..this book shows you how. I loved the classic illustration work as well."
5,Best & favorite crossword puzzle book,I love this book. Bought it about 10 mo ago and then lost it. It is so good that I bought another copy. I can find more in this book compared to the other three books that I own. I can recommend this book to everyone who likes to do crossword puzzles.
2,New Comprehensive A-Z Crossword Dictionary,"It's okay but not the one I wanted. That was on ""back order"". Hope it comes soon."
4,Pretty good when your in a bind for the answer.,My son bought me a book just like this for christmas about 4 years ago and it ended up falling apart. I was lost without it so I ordered me another one. It comes in handy when your stumped on a crossword.
2,Is it me?,"Am I the only one that thinks Ann is taking the easy way out with her short stories? I know she spent alot of time on her recent book, but these 30 year old stories have got to go. With all the lunatics running around out there, it seems to me that Ann would be writing one book after another. ""The Highway Accident"" was in a previous book, so why did I have to spend $7.00 to read about it again? Although the stories here were interesting, I can't help but wonder why Ann remains focused on such old stories."
1,Don't waste your money,Old newspaper stories put into an overpriced book to make Ms. Rule some extra spending money. Skip this one!
1,Maybe I'll just give up being an Ann Rule fan.,"No, it's not just you. This book is pathetic. Usually I love Ann Rule and I have enjoy each one of her books. But this???? Ugh. Old stories from 30 years ago or more. Stories already repeated in other books? And no indepth character descriptions like her other books. Maybe it's time for me to give up on Ann Rule and find another author. Don't buy it. It's a waste of time and money. Will Ann Rule ever get over having known Ted Bundy? My God, she talks about it in each and every book. I'm really tired of hearing about how she knew him. My, my, my, she's had a whole career on how she knew Ted Bundy, now get over it and stop talking about it. I can't take it anymore. And yes, Ann we also know you were once a policewoman for like a minute. Hurray to you. I should look at other True Crime writers and find a new one. Ann, same old, same old, it too old."
3,derivative Ann Rule material...,"In now the 9th of her Crime Files series it has become clear Ann Rule has run out of interesting crime cases to report on, or she is simply going through the motions on some modestly interesting cases with lots of dust on them (most were over thirty years old). I bought this book at the airport right before boarding a transatlantic flight, as a last minute purchase. At least it was very readable, in Ann Rule's somewhat folksy way. But having finished the book a couple of days ago I cannot remember any of the true crime stories it contains. This doesn't speak well for the book(, nor for me?).Bottom line: utter true crime fodder. Ann Rule has done much, much better."
2,Not very good,"I find myself disapointed once again with an Ann Rule book. The last few have not been up to the usual Ann Rule format. I hate to say it but, I too have considered not bothering to read another. Waste of money to read old cases that had been printed in earlier books."
4,Perfect Fit,"I bought this for my Golf Guru GPS. It fits perfect, though I did cut the plastic out of it..."
5,Good Book,A Little Piece of Sky is a book that everyone should read. It tells the story of how a person goes from being an insecure little girl to a self confident and self assured young woman. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a little peice of sky to get them through lifes stormy madness.
3,Not his best,"I ordered this a few weeks ago along with The Triumph and the Glory and the Harry Potter books and this is the only one of the five that didn;t measure up to my expectations. Pop Gies the Weasel just sort of fell flat, the plot drifted about, the characters were rather wooden, and the suspense and tension were nowhere near the levels I've been accustomed to from Patterson."
1,Very Disappointing!,"Sometimes a bad book just keeps you in. In this case, the ending proved that you just wasted your time."
3,Hooked!,"I have always enjoyed the cunning and intelligent ""bad guy"" characters that James Patterson creates. I did object to the detailed description of crime scenes even though I know they are necessary to show just how deranged the killer is. Even with these objections I am hooked on Dr. Alex Cross, his family and friends and I'll be waiting for the next book because I know our bad guy will be back for another book or two."
2,Like a roller-coaster ride,"It's exciting while it lasts, but it's not really all that memorable. The fantasy games and The Weasel were certainly innovative, but the impact that this traumatic case might have on the lives of his family (don't worry, I won't spoil it by saying more) are touched on in such a superficial way it's almost offensive. Alex Cross loves his kids, fiancee and old nana, right? I would have appreciated it if he spent more time on them during his narrative. He seems almost as uninterested in the effects this case may have on his family as the Weasel is about his ex-pat clan, and the Weasel is a sociopath! Show us a little more humanity, and we'll carry Alex Cross around with us a little longer after the book is done."
5,Thanks again Mr. Patterson!,"James Patterson is just good! Anyone who has read his Alex Cross novels know that. Pop Goes the Weasel is soooo good. The moment I started reading it, I could not put it down. I took it to work with me and would actually read it in my cubicle. If you have never read an Alex Cross novel, you can start with this one. Patterson does not give away information on previous novels that would ruin those stories, so please read them. This book is not for the squeemish. There are some graphic parts so be forewarned. Although this is not as graphic as Kiss the Girls, if Kiss the Girls was hard for you to read, then you may want to reconsider this one. I doubt this one will dissapoint you on those lonely, cold winter nights coming up. ENJOY!"
2,Poor editing,"Too bad, the book would have been much more of a pleasure if the editor (or the author) had taken time to realize that the same surprise announcement is communicated to the Cross family twice, once in Chapter 27 and once in Chapter 40"
1,Wretched,"Utterly predictable, Patterson gives away his plot ""twists"" with all the subtlety of a rubber mallet between the eyes. The endless repetition of the ""police ignore the murders in SE Washington"" theme made my eyes cross. Its also poorly edited--- in two different places in the book he tells his family about his engagement, and its mighty weird that they're surprised the second time, and then whoops and hugging follow, yet again. I generally enjoy Patterson's works, but this was tedious beyond belief. If the power hadn't been out, leaving me with nothing else to do by candlelight, I probably wouldn't have finished this."
2,First poor Alex Cross novel,"Patterson's slide into unequivocable decline was most obvious here. It is merely a retread of previous Alex Cross plot devices cobbled together under a different title. I was sorely disappointed.Please, Jim: No more Cross family members and love interests getting killed, kidnapped, or attacked. It couldn't possibly happen on EVERY case. It's old. You've done it. Stop it. Now! Please!"
3,An enjoyable read,I enjoyed this book but I was a little annoyed that (after 400 or so pages) I was just being set up for a sequel.
1,A huge disappointment,"Loved all previous Alex Cross, but should have know Patterson was losing it when he wrote that ""Butterfly girl"" sci-fi wannabe. Who was that man disguised as Alex? And the bad guy? - - couple of sick scenarios, but no suspense or backbone. What a bore! Save your money."
2,"""Empire Strikes Back"" of Alex Cross Series","I am a huge fan of James Patterson's writing. I even liked ""When the Wind Blows"" -- a lot. However, I found this long-awaited novel sadly disappointing. ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" read like it was written for the movie screen rather than for the avid reader and seemed like a set-up for a sequel. It had some wonderful passages but was mostly predictable and disappointing. How could you, James?"
1,No mystery. Predictable,"As an avid James Patterson reader, I decided to give him another shot after reading When the Wind Blows. Now, after I painfully completed ""Pop"",I will have to reconsider any further novels by him. I found this novel predictable and without mystery at all. The characters were boring and the writing ""sappy"".There was no intrigue to the murders and even Samson was weak. The children's dialogue were overgrown and Nana got on my nerves. The only positive thing is, is that I borrowed this book from the library instead of purchasing it."
2,james patterson not at top of game,"i love the character of alex cross (morgan freeman did a great job in kiss the girls). however i give this book 2 stars since it didn't have much in the way of character and plot development but was just plain gory. the plot was not as compelling as his other cross mysteries. all this guy did was slash and kill people, primarily women, in terrible and violent ways. yeah yeah yeah we've seen this before james - can we do something a little more imaginative next time? i also did not find shafer to be as intriguing as gary soneji as a villain."
3,As Always Cross is entertaining but...,"Alex Cross is one of the best detectives I have read, I have always enjoyed this series this novel left a little to be desired though the ending seemed a bit rushed and didn't really satisfy me. As I closed this book I saw myself thiking that none of this was plausible or possible. If you enjoy detective novels then this is a good read, If this is your first Patterson novel please pick something else."
3,This Story is Okay,"I listened to this audiobook while commuting to work. It is good. Not the best Alex Cross plot, but not the worst, either. I look forward listening to the sequel."
4,Good Book,"After being semi dissapointed with cat & mouse Patterson came back with this next book in the ""Alex Cross"" series. It was better then the previous and I recomend to any Patterson fan."
2,The Story is too Predictable and Ended Like a Romance Novel,"I am normally a big James Patterson fan. I have read all his books and usually feel they are ""page turners""Pop Goes the Weasel isn't a page turner. There were key places where I predicted what was going to happen and sure enough - it happened just that way. I like to be surprised.I think he gave the sappy romantic ending away early in the book. It wasn't obvious but it was there.Not the suspense I was hoping for."
2,disappointing...,"I could not wait to get my hands on this new James Patterson novel. Alex Cross is my favorite! However, Pop Goes the Weasel was certainly not up to par with Patterson's other works. I finished the book with feelings of boredom and disappointment."
3,Not quite living up to his standard of excellence....,"Being a long time fan of Patterson and especially the Alex Cross character, I was a little disappointed in this recent go-around. Although the suspense and intrigue were there as always, there also seemed to be something else there, something out of place...too much sappy stuff. Cross is supposed to be a tough cop solving spellbiding cases and pursuing brilliant killers. It appears as though the Cross character is becoming soft. Patterson, you really need to get back to the core of the character -- a smart, ""I'm gonna nail you to the wall"" type of guy. Hoping the next one is a blockbuster."
2,Awful and embarrassing.,"I don't know what's up with Patterson. There is no excuse for some of the glaring errors in this book.The ending makes no sense.This is not up to the standards of ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider""."
1,Soapoperatic schlock,"For me Pop Goes the Weasel was Patterson's second chance after Roses Are Red. I was disappointed with Roses and decided to try an earlier entry in the series. Patterson won't get a third chance.Pop Goes the Weasel put me off very early. Our hero is a widower with small children at home and an extremely time consuming job. When he has spare time he goes for romance when he really should be spending it with the kids. Yet Patterson portrays him as a model father. Frankly, I got disgusted with the combination of over the top villains, attempted family realism and cliched romance. I gave up.The Alex Cross stories are very popular. The reason escapes me."
1,a joke,"Please. Errors galore. Reminded me of John Grisham's The Client which was a horrible book but a good movie. Seems written in a hurry for a movie with the hopes that actors could do something with it that wasn't in the writing. (If you do make this into a movie, please get someone other than Morgan Freeman as Alex. At least a young studly Alex would give it an extra star!)"
1,An MP3 copy,"Let me put it this way: I took the CD, inserted it into my PC and... nothng. The disc they gave me was an MP3 copy, so bad I had to input the track names by hand."
4,dont get me wrong....,"...I do like this album. But for some reason, i guess i just cannot see what the big deal is. I only own this and ""V - The New Mythology Suite"" by Symphony X, but I must say ""V"" is FAR better than this. In fact, the only really great song on here is the 24 minute epic title track, which is EXCELLENT. The rest of the songs are good to forgettable(not bad, just well.....forgettable). If you really want an album that displays this bands talent, pick up ""V"" first."
5,S.T. 37 Antiseptic Liquid,"I haven't used this product for oral pain relief, although apparently it works well for that. I use it as a general skin conditioner. It takes the sting and itch out of insect bites and minor abrasions wonderfully. This is a really old remedy my father used. It's fairly difficult to locate now, so it was great to see it on Amazon.com I mainly ordered it for my niece who is experiencing some fairly horrific side effects from chemotherapy. It has worked well for her with no side effects of its own."
1,Bad!,"Well to start off, 25% of the movie you can't hear what they are saying. Poor sound and the background music being way too loud. That is the most annoying thing about this movie. The movie itself has issues as well. Poor lighting bad camera angles it's just irritating. The whole movie seemed to be lacking. You never feel any emotion towards the characters (and you kind of wish they would both die). To add on top of that you have a plot twist that makes no sense (when the girl is kidnapped). Just a bad movie."
5,Forget Roundabout...,"Forget 'Roundabout' and it's overplayed status. The rest of the disc is full of buried treasure! Kids, if you want to hear REAL MUSICIANS play, this is IT! All of the tracks on the disc are like worlds-in-themselves. Just close your eyes and listen to the subtle riffs...Steve Howe (guitar) is BRILLIANT!"
4,Canon PowerShot S70,"Canon has enhanced the PowerShot line with the introduction of the S70. The only drawback that I've seen with this model so far is that Canon has moved the rear display screen over to the left more than in the S50 so you don't have a place to rest your left thumb while taking pictures. The S50 was easier to hold in that respect. In addition, the S70 uses the same underwater housing as the S60 (WP-DC40), but not the same as the S50 (WP-DC300). The quality of the pictures is great and the software that comes with the camera is quite nice. For additional information, check out the S70 on the Canon web site."
2,Something getting in the way,"This is my first digital camera. It takes great pictures. However, the sliding door is becoming more and more of a nuisance. Just about any contact with it causes the lens to close. Picture a group of smiling friends or relatives. As soon as you hit the shutter button, the camera turns itself off. Then you ask your friends to re-pose. You snap the shutter. Darn, the lens goes in again. You try again. The lens goes in again! Eventually, you succeed in taking a shot. Just about every important shot you want to take, you have to put up with this nuisance. Before long your friends don't want you taking their pictures with this camera; and you don't want to either. Well, I'm actually looking to buy a new camera and thought I'd share my experience with you. :-D."
1,Very disappointing!!,"Maybe I shouldn't compare this game to others but I have been playing COD, Metal of Honor, Killzone, and Drake's Fortune and this game is like going back to the PS2. Graphics are lackluster and hazy. No run, jump, or crawl. The use of cover is the best part of this game. I quit playing just after the church-top assault. I expected more from a Tom Clancy game."
1,Terrible! Just Terrible!,"I feel relived that I bought this game used from Gamestop. That allowed me to return it if I didn't like it. I returned it the same day I bought it. This game is just terrible. It was created as a PS2 game, but then was just created on PS3 and Xbox 360. All the company that created this game did was take the PS2 version and write it onto a PS3 and Xbox 360 disc. The graphics look terrible and the lighting effects are worse. It is very hard to see and you sometimes have to use nightvision in plain daylight just to see two feet in front of you. Also, the terrorists are just plain stupid and will stand around and get shot sometimes. At some points in the game, you just sit around wondering what to do next. I know the reviews on this game are great, but please take my advice and rent this game before you spend $30 bucks on this piece of garbage."
2,Bad scripting cannot replace good A.I.,"The game has many good aspects, particularly gameplay dynamics. The controls are effective and intuitive (good cover system) and the graphics are OK. For some reason, though, the game insists on preferring 1080i over 720P even though this creates a hazy pixellated mess out of otherwise first-rate graphics; be sure to disable 1080i/P on your PS3 before playing this title.The storyline is OK but the gameplay is plagued with horrendous scripting and ridiculous spawning (i.e., a terrorist ""appears"" behind you in a sealed room and pops one in the back of your head). This makes for an increasingly frustrating experience as the levels become more difficult. It seems as though the only difference between difficulty levels lies in the number of goons that rope down to your vicinity when you walk half way through the rooms.Overall, too many flaws to save from bargain bin status"
4,rainbow six vegas,"I really enjoyed this game. It was one of the first games I bought with my newly purchased PS3 and let me tell you that it didn't disappoint. The storyline keeps you on your toes, and there is nothing better than a good ol' first person shooter. I highly recommend this game to anyone who owns a PS3 or is planning on buying one. It is one of the strongest games out on the market as of right now."
3,Dissaointed with the graphics,"i couldn't make up my mind on witch game to buy first, resistance fall of man or rainbow six. i really like the game play in rainbow 6 but the graphics are pretty bad and it seems pretty dark the whole game. I have a 55'' plasma hdtv and that shouldn't have been the problem resistance fall of man wasn't dissapointing at all compared to r6 they have great graphics. R6 is like playing a ps2 game on my ps3"
4,Rainbow Six rocks!,"I really enjoyed this game. I think I liked Ghost Recon 2 a little bit better, but this was a fun, challenging game."
1,wow,"wow! i'm so gald i only 25 cents for this book, after hearing so many great reviews on Mr.Salvatore this was a shock and disappointment. words fail me. this is the first and last book of his i ever need to read. its the oldest of stories with nothing new>"
2,disappointed,"There is nothing particularly Jungian about this Tarot deck.In order to utilize this deck of cards as reflective of Jungian thought,you must have the Wang workbook, which is sold separately."
1,Disappointing,"I wanted this deck for ages because I love Carl Jung and felt the symbolism of this deck would be amazing. Alas, I was really, really disappointed. If you are looking to expand on the traditional Rider-Waite deck (which I was), this will probably disappoint you as well. There are no numeric values depicted and the imagery is boring and barren. Each suit of the minor arcana has the same background images for each, is lacking in symbolism and the only difference between them is another sword, cup, etc added to the picture. I was really hoping that this deck would be rich in symbolism and depict the meanings behind the cards through that imagery. I have a hard time finding the meaning just staring at six swords with clouds in the background. So, if you are anything like me and look for a story within the imagery, this deck is not for you. I would not have purchased it if I had known this and will be returning it."
3,The plot started 180 pages into the book.,"My friends and I all read the same copy f this book withen a week. I haven't seen the movie, but I wanted to read the book. The first 180 pages are introduction. The next ten pages are the climax and ending. And the ending wasn't that great anyway. There were no clues leading up to the why certain things happen at the climax, and the things that do happen are two pags before the climax. Pls, I wish this book was more historical fictiony. If I didn't know it took place in the 50s, I would have guessd it took place now. I don't really reccomend this. My friends said it was really sad and cute, but it wasn't at all. Read OUT OF TIME by Caroline B. Cooney."
3,The Spark is Missing,"Yes, it is a sweet story -- still not in the league with The Notebook, but definitely an improvement over Message in a Bottle. The writing is not inspired, though it is easy to imagine it to be the words of a 17 year old. Mr. Sparks weaves an inspirational story of faith and trust and living our lives to the fullest. Touching, though a bit sappy and maudlin, but nonetheless worthwhile. More of a screenplay, though, than literature."
5,Great Book!,I couldn't put this book down! I highly recommend having a box of Kleenex nearby when reading this.
1,Predictable! ... real drudgery...,"After reading 'Message in a Bottle', I was prepared to read yet another wonderful love story. I was a bit surprised to read such a boring, predictable, and totally depressing novel...There was no laughter and certainly no tears while reading it. I do wish that Mr. Sparks would write a book with a happy ending!"
4,"Better than ""The Notebook""!","I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, and I have to say that this one is the best one of them all. Yes, it is even better than ""The Notebook"". Although the begnning was somewhat slow, the story picked up, and before I knew it, I was totaly engrossed in the love story of Landon and Jamie. And being the sentimental person that I am, the end of the book left me in tears. Sparks has improved so much as both a writer and a story teller. I am looking forward to his next book."
1,pure drivel,"I had read message in a bottle, and while it wasn't the BEST book I ever read, it was still enjoyable, with a little twist at the end. But this was absolutely midless drivel. It was lazy use of the English language; it was so un-thought-provoking!And the story was so predictable, that it is inexcusable that Sparks would not even devote an iota of effort to making the launguage interesting! I felt I had wasted a few hours of my life that I will never get back.Read this if you are hard up for entertainment, and just want to kill a few hours. But do not look to this book for stimulation, or even for a good story! It was just mindless drivel."
4,Sensitive and gripping,"As usual, Nicholas Sparks gives us a wonderful escape into a different world... a world where we laugh and cry with the characters portrayed."
4,Another One?,"I find that whenever I read a book by Nicholas Sparks, I always find myself crying.. I don't even bother to watch the movies after The Notebook came out.The book is great at best and in certain parts is pretty boring.. In my opinion, it takes a while in certain chapters for the author to get to the point."
4,"Mandy Moore Stars as Jamie, due out in January","YES!!!!! Mandy Moore, the beloved pop singer will play the part of Jamie in the major motion picture release of A WALK TO REMEMBER, due out in January. This movie will be a tear jerker!!! I read the book in one day. It was very easy to read and very touching, However, u can almost feel what is about to happen next, which is not really good, I want surprises. You will fall in love with Jamie, and Landon. You will be able to relate and learn from both characters. I dont want to spoil anyone's fun but I will say the ending was cute but a little too fake, ""unreal"". Read the book, its a treat. Then, when the movie comes out, go watch it!!"
5,Excellent!!!,"Hey guys-This book was absolutely extravagant! I could not ask for a better book to sit down by a fire and read. Most of my friends know that I am into books, you wouldnt know it by my personality, because Im outgoing, but I love good books, and often review them. This book was one of the best thatIve read. This book has to do with a young man, who knows this girl for basically his life, and never really saw her.When he finally realizes that shes not just the girl he used to know, but much more, sparks begin to fly.. but will the love stand through what the girl has to tell him? I suggest that you try the book, its a tearjerker, but its a good one."
1,Not worth the wait,Drivel is about how to describe this. Very predictable and not very engaging. I give this a thumbs down. I have read his other two books and thought both were very good. A big disappointment here.
5,a beautiful timeless love story,Nicholas Sparks has done it again. This book had me laughing and crying along with the highly lovable characters. This gripping tale of young but true love had me hooked until the very end. I would highly reccomed this novel to anyone.
2,Cheap!,"Ok... i thought that the story was written pretty well, hence the 2 stars. But the plot is literally ripped off from another story! The book is called LOVE STORY and it's basically the same concept:1. Rich guy falls in love with not so wealthy girl2. Girl only lives with father since there is no mother3. Rich guy has a bad attitude in the beginning and a bad relationship with his father4. Girl get sick and dies from the same disease that Jaimie Sullivan has!The only difference is Jaimie and Landon are in high school, and the couple from LOVE STORY are in college."
3,"""A Walk"" in Slow Steps","Having read Nicholas Sparks other heartfelt tomes, ""Message In A Bottle"" and ""The Notebook"", I was advancedly prepared to read his newest tearjerker. Yep, I had the Kleenex with aloe handy.However, ""A Walk To Remember"", seemed more like trippingly slow steps of two teenagers finding each other while pushed together during a Christmas play.I wanted to like this book, I really did. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was an unoriginal plot of boy meets girl, boy starts to take on lifes impending adulthood. I just could not wrap myself around Landon Carter and Jaime Sullivan.I might attempt to read it again...when I am in the mood for Sparks' emotional coupling of humor and remembrance. Still worth the buy.Thanks for your interest in my comments--CDS"
4,Movie Better,"I found it not quite as interesting as the movie, which had a much, much better and more exciting ending."
2,disappointed :-(,"so what,I didn't cry. I'm not a heartless person,mind you,I read 'the notebook' and cried alot but this book...well...didn't quite follow up.I think the writer tried too hard to make this book..sad..but it's not! the most emotional scene for me is when Landon and Jamie exchange christmas gifts and that's all.I'm bad at writing review and I don't want to criticize too much, but having the girl died from leukemia at the end of the story, come on! what is this,erich segal's? I have to say this is disappointing. (ok, sorry for criticized too much)"
3,"Young love, first love, sacrificial love","Young love, first love, sacrificial love is the story of Nickolas Spark's third novel.The son of a rich, powerful politician meets the only daughter of a widowed Baptist minister in a small North Carolina town in 1958. Combine the awkward years of high school dating, the popular boy meets the outcaste ""do gooder"" girl (add one small town orphanage), the annual Christmas play and top with a fatal sickness and - Walla! - a readable love story.Throughout ""A Walk to Remember,"" Sparks' underlying message is ""do the right thing."" While this book is not up to his brilliant first love story, ""The Notebook,"" it is a significant improvement over the co-dependent disappointment of ""Message in a Bottle.""""A Walk to Remember"" is a quick, beach-book read that will satisfy those hankering for a feel-good love story. Recommended."
4,I never read books like this,"I am by no means a ""romantic"" type, nor do I read romance-style books, but this book captivated me. After reading The Notebook I just had to read A Walk to Remember. I was not at all disappointed. I could recommend this book to anyone - no matter what style book you prefer - this book is well worth reading."
4,Bad Ending,"Everything was so great in the beginning. The love betweet the two was fresh. It was a love that I could only wish I would have. I was narrowing in on the end and I knew what was coming. But then the book shocked me with a highly unbelievable unding. Marriage? Give me a break. It was sweet but in a real world that would never happen. Also, like usual the book is 100% better than the movie but that's usually how it is."
5,A Book You Will Always Remember,"I started off reading this book with the reservation that it would be another sappy teen love story. I was wrong. This book delves into the conscience of Landons character, who is consciously selfish and somewhat shallow by nature but has a hidden depth to him that he doesnt show. Jamie is the catalyst between the boy he was and the great man he becomes. She opens him up to a world where beauty isnt seen in appearance but in heart. A love like this is something we should all experience once in our lives. Sparks goes beyond the human realm of physical and emotional love and illustrates the pure spirituality love has to offer us."
3,Rex's Review,"A Walk to Remember is a book about a young man, Landon Carter, who, without knowing it, falls in love with the preacher's daughter. Jamie Sullivan, the preacher's daughter, is an unlikely match for Landon, but nonetheless a sweet likeable young lady. This is a classic love story, the boy (Landon) unwillingly falls in love with the girl (Jamie), the girl gets sick and his world seems as if it is falling apart. I felt Sparks' foreshadowing was a little overdone because I could predict what was going to happen throughout the entire novel. For some it was a tearjerker, as for me it was not. I liked the book and would recommend it to others, but I do not think I would ever want to read it again."
1,Loved the notebook....walk to forget?,"Sigh....looks like a late ditch effort to get a book out before the holidays to pay for the family boat. I loved 'The Notebook'. This pales in comparison. Believe me, borrow a copy from a friend if you're curious. Hope this is not a trend...."
3,Thought Provoking for Teens,A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks was chosen as a text for eighth graders. It provided ample topics for classroom discussion and introduced the students to personal and emotional issues they might not have considered without the stimulus of this novel. Many of the students found the novel's ending unsatisfactory even disappointing. Some said they felt the main issues were left unresolved.
2,A bit too saccharin for my tastes,"Though his other two books are quite good, if overly sentimental, this book didn't quite do it for me. The story was too syrupy, the characters to young to really be believable. Landon had a very quick change of heart... These could be forgiven, I suppose, if the heroine was not so disgustingly perfect. She wasn't even human (I realize she is only seen through the eyes of a young man in love, but still). Her character had no complexities at all. I suppose my main problem was that the story was too sweet to be believed. It was better before Landon fell in love and before Jamie told him of her illness. After that it was just ridiculous."
3,A major disappointment,"Having read both The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, I eagerly awaited Mr. Sparks' newest book. I really enjoyed the first two - my measuring stick - how many tears shed! A Walk to Remember was mediocre. It was easy to read and short, but did not hold my interest at all. The characters were not appealing and the pace was too slow. I will definitely not run out to buy his next release."
5,A Walk to Remember,I loved the book and was dissappointed when the movie didn't play out the same way. Nicholas Sparks knows how to grab a reader's heartstrings at any age.
5,Best Book I've Ever Read..,When I read this book I was a little skeptical.Then after I was reading the book for about a couple chapters I realized I couldn't put the book down.After I was finished with the book I cried because the story was so heart-felt and sad that's all u can do is cry.
5,A beautiful story of timeless love,Nicholas Sparks has once again touched my heart and left me with the sense of how powerful love can be. Each of us can only hope to be loved as Landon loved Jamie. This is a book that stays with you long after you close the cover.
1,This book is boring!,"I watched the movie first with that Mandy Moore girl and really liked the movie. It was cute and sweet. So I was excited to read the book. ... I've never came across a movie that was better then the book until now. This book was terrible. Badly written and (YAWN) boring! It went on and on and on. I finally had to put it down and read something else. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,So incredibly sweet!,"This book is a very quick read, only about three hours. It held me from the short sample downloaded to my kindle until the very end of the book, only stopping to refill my coffee cup. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan and this is definitely one of my favorites. I only wish it was longer!"
4,Easy reading,This book was an easy read. I have never read a book in one sitting and I sat at home sick one day and read it from cover to cover... It's a nice story that should entertain you if not make you cry.
4,Good but not his best,A Walk to Remember was very quick & detailed up until the end. I was very disappointed with the ending. I felt like I had missed something in reading. The ending left me wondering more about what actually happened & I was confused by the whole thing.
5,A Very Sweet Love Story,"A Walk to Remember is a book that illustrates the power of love. Landon, a popular boy falls in love with Jamie, an unpopular girl whose father is a minister. Landon realizes how special she is and must deal with the conflict between Jamie and his friends. Then Jamie must tell Landon her secret that they will deal with together. You will cry, but the story will also touch your heart. This book shows all the elements of love and growing up."
3,The Spark has fizzeled out,"I have to say that Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. A Walk to Remember was a wonderful story, but lacked on some level, the emotion put forth in The Notebook and Message in a Bottle. It is definitely worth reading, don't get me wrong, but don't expect the same reaction you had with the other two."
3,Only okay,"I think the movie is better. Much more emotion from the movie than book. The book is okay and an easy read, but it was lacking substance,maybe lacking some emotion too."
5,Awesome Book,Beautiful love story!! The ending was a surprise to me. The movie was great as well. I enjoy his novels and this is another great novel by Mr. Sparks.
1,boring and immature,"After reading both Message in a Bottle and The Notebook, and loving them both, I couldn't wait for Nicholas Sparks' next book. This one seemed to be written by a seventh-grader in its content and characters. It was too predictable and goody-goody to keep me interested. Although I always read a book in its entirety, even if I don't like it, this was one book I would have put down after a couple of chapters, but since I bought it I needed to try to get my money's worth. After reading two-thirds of the book, something finally happened but not anything substantial. All the clues that something will happen, what a tease! Try again, Nicholas, and don't rush the next one."
4,Great Story,"I read this book in one sitting. It makes you want to keep reading until you discover the conclusion. If you enjoy Nicholas Sparks, this book will not let you down. My favorite Nicohlas Sparks book is The Notebook, but this book comes close. I would definitly reccommend this book."
5,absolutely astonishing,this book teaches you not to look over people who you dont normally hang out with but keep your eyes wide upen for love and new friends. I truely believe this shpd set an example to all!!!!
3,Good story -- not an exciting read...,"Although the story is crafted quited well, I did not find the book an exciting read. The book flew by quite fast since the book is easily read and not of great length.The story is quite riveting but just doesn't have the 'oopmh' to keep me on the edge, old fashion love stories just dont keep my occupied as well as other genres could.But, like I said, the story is good. It is worth the time spent if you are in the mood for a small love story which does not get crowded by small trivial trials and tribulations. It's concise and direct, making it simple and managable."
5,Its a great read!,"I really loved this book! It made me laugh, cry, and everything in between! I recommend this book to anyone with a heart. It took me less than 2 hours total to finish up this book. Read this book!"
4,A Book to Remember,"I enjoyed A Walk to Remember. It was another triumph for Nicholas Sparks. I becamed hooked on his novels with The Notebook. I know I will become involved with the characters and I also know that I will end up with a box of Kleenex before I finish. The characters are slightly predictable but they are real as well. If you liked The Notebook or Message in a Bottle you will also like A Walk to Remember. My sister has mixed feelings about the book, she didn't like it as well as the others but I was satisfied with the story and will probably read it again, which is an indication of a good read."
4,First time Sparks reader,"This is the first book by Mr Sparks that I have read and I could not put it down. Although the tale is drippingly sweet, and the moral point delivered rather bluntly, the writing is beautiful. Landon tells us this story in beautiful prose tha really got to me emotionally. I am not one to really cry when reading a novel (except ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"") but I was crying my eyes out on my commuter train.I look forward to reading Sparks other works"
4,A Walk To Remember,Great book... Nicholas Sparks never ceases to amaze me with his ability to write these novels.. I enjoyed every word in this book.. I could not put it down
4,Nicholas Sparks has done it again!,"After reading both The Notebook and Message in a Bottle with such enthusiasm, I couldn't wait for A Walk in the Park. Sparks does a terrfic job of getting your full attention and keeping it til the very and at that point wanting more, more, more! It was a more touching story of first loves than the previous 2 that were deeply detailed with loves thoughts and actions. I can't wait for the next"
5,A Classic,"I have never read any books by Nicholas Sparks before this one but after finishing ""A Walk to Remember"" I will. It's a classic, touching love story that I couldn't put down once I started. I recommend it for absolutly anyone! I am in high school so I related well to some of the things Jamie and Landen were going through, but I must say, you can be 17, or 71 to enjoy this book, it's so heartfelt and it really makes you think about your own life. Wonderful book. I also thought the ending was done quite well..."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"Ok let me get straight to it! This book was AWESOME! I do not like to read books and when I started reading it I could not stop! Nicholas Sparks is a fantastic author and his books are fantastic too! You can learn so much from this book! It teaches you how not to judge people by the way they look, you really need to get to know them! Take Jamie Sullivan (i can't spell) noone would talk to her because she was uncool! All they needed to do was give her a chance! I think EVERYONE needs to read this book! It it awesome and you will learn alot from it:)"
5,it will keep u up all night,"This book is a really good book. It is sad too. I dont read a lot of books, but this one I had to read. I think anyone would like this book."
4,A walk to remember is worth passing down.,"I thought this was an excellent book. It was easy to read and flowed from page to page. At the time I read the book my teen-aged daughter had her first ""boyfriend"" I passed it along to her to read and she also thought it was great."
4,master of character portraits,"Drawing from mundane incidents, Rhys's stories are told with a tone that is unsentamental and often detached. Yet her eye for detail, and in particular, character is unmatched. From everyday events she is able to create striking and realistic character portraits as witnessed in among others ""Tout Mountparnasse and a Lady,"" where the ""lady"" is to be both pitied and despised. While her stories and characters are often filled with a sense of crushing despair (""Sleep in Off Lady"" is particularly depressing), I also felt that her sense of humor (though often dark) is much more evident here than in her novels. In short, a great introduction to an underappreciated author."
5,As Usual...,"This album was dropped a long time after it's expected release date simply because (as usual) the record label just dont know what to do with Untouchable legendary emcees(Rakim & Kool G Raps are 2 other examples) thankfully it was put out. Now the beats are well made but as usual it's Chino's lyrical skill and the colabos that make this album. My favorite track would be the one with Killah Priest, but the tracks with beatnutz & Proof(R.I.P.)are both dope. I'd say it's not as well produced as his last 2 records but still worth getting for a true Chino XL fan."
1,"Hopefully, it's still coming","I know this album should be out already but I think it has to do with Chino on a different label (Bolo Entertainment/Bungalo Records.) Go peep the new Sway and Tech album, ""Back 2 Basics"" since Chino XL is on three of the tracks plus the album includes a live freestyle he did back in 2000; s#%* is hot, yo."
5,World's Best Band Comes Alive Again!,"I received an advance copy of ""Unfold the Future"" last week and over the weekend I was in Flower King Heaven! This CD is the best CD out there - hands down! It is their best work, equally as good as ""Space Revolver"" and beyond. Many favorite tracks include ""The Navigator"" followed by Vox Humana (absolutely excellent!), ""Genie in a Bottle"" ""Man Overboard"" ""Solitary Shell"" etc., etc. The whole album (over 2 hours) ROCKS!!!! There is nothing like this out there. Take my word for it. Nothing of this magnitude has been done in popular music for eons. Easily the best album of 2002."
1,"I'm sorry, but this CD is awful","Being a King Crimson fan I read in a magazine about the new prog rockers such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, etc. I'm sorry folks but this CD is awful. I should have known that a Swedish prog rock group is an oxymoron. The music is not compelling, there are no melodies or lyrics that linger. These guys are not Yes, King Crimson, or Genesis. I've been critical of Transatlantic before, but the weakness of the Flower Kings makes Transatlantic prog rock gods. Maybe it is my age, or I'm too involved in the early prog rock movement to appreciate the modern prog rockers. If so my apologies, however, this CD is awful."
3,unfold the future,"i have to say, i am disappointed with unfold the future thus far, after 3 complete listens. i was pretty underwhelmed.i was instantly impressed with 'flower power'. the new record does not have that same initial excitement factor. dont get me wrong. roine stolt is still one of the best guitarists around. the flower kings' chops are all in order. it just seems that after the epic opening cut, the band looses direction. i am a big fan of noodling and experimentation, but this seems to be noodling just for the sake of it. it seems to be all pomp and no circumstance.i hope i am wrong though. heres why. with most of my favorite records, i had a similar experience with all of them, just as teh one i had with 'unfold the future.' initially underwhelmed, but then after a few more careful listens, the records greatness was truly revealed.i can only hope that the same happens here. until then, unfold the future is a disappointment."
1,Terrible,Vert poorly written and an utter waste of time. I cant believe this book actually got published. The editing and the writing is quite terrible. This guy needs to go back to college to learn how to write a book.
1,"Wont learn, gave up","Used Dragon Naturally Speaking for years on my PC, but shifted to a Mac and got this program. Did two tutorials and txt document for training, but after hours of frustrating attemps, will have to give it up. Most of the time it will not even correctly recognize the command ""correct that"", and enters other words. Repeatedly I did corrections of common words to no avail. I have some disappointments with the Mac, but this is serious for one used to voice dictation."
3,Not as good as i wuld like,"I purchased this product hoping I could save myself a lot of typing. It kept adding words that i was not saying and by the time i corrected it, it would add more words. I am writing a book on short stories, so i had to send them to my sister to type for me."
4,"Great Book For Coaches, Fans, and Leaders","In this book, Coach K does an excellent job of explaining his leadership techniques and how they have led to his unrivaled success with the Duke University men's basketball progream. While Duke fans will appreciate the examples more than non-fans, anyone who takes a leadership role in their life, or wants to, can benefit from reading this book. I would especially recommend it for aspiring coaches - from little league to the pros.The layout of the book adds to its effectiveness. Sections of the book are labeled much like a basketball season...with the preseason, season, postseason, and all year. When he puts his leadership tactics in this layout, it helps everyone whose role as a leader changes focus throughout the year."
1,THE worst book I have read by any coach,"I am a professional College Coach. I have read Coach K's book and I found it to be the worst book I have ever read. The book repeats itself over and over again. Almost like he doesn't have anything really to say so he filled the book with filler. Nothing in the book made me go wow. Nothing was new to the coaching or leading world. Save your money and get a real book on Leadership.I do not know one Coach in the NCAA world that has not read this book. And I can say that the majority of people agree with me. The ones that don't are just big Coach K or Duke fans.I am not a UCLA fan in anyway. But I found that John Wooden's book to be more thoughtful and helpful.Skip this book and find books on Leadership in the business world. Coach K is a great coach, but he can't write a book. And lets be honest it is not hard to coach the 10 best College players like Duke has. It is harder to coach the 10 worst. And that is what we all are looking to get advice from."
2,cannot consider new,I purchased this book to give as a gift. It was described as new. When I received it it had a bend in the book and a big black marker across the top of the spine. I could no longer give this as a gift and had to go to a store to buy a good one. I would never purchase from this vendor unless you didn't care what it looks like !
2,"For veterans of the weights, naw...","I have read Steve Arlin's ""Raw Power"" two or three times now. As a struggling ""rawist"" I find some parts to be helpful, and even inspirational. Other parts I find to be a bit self-aggrandizing, and not to functional.Bottom line, if you are new to Raw Foodism, and want to lift weights, then-aside from the workouts being way to long- read it and get some ideas. I would suggest other works for a better grasp of weight lifting in, and of itself.If you are a weight lifting veteran, and have been around the gym awhile, as so many have already stated, you won't be too impressed. For you stick with what you are doing, and phase in the raw food diet as you go."
4,D&D players hand book,this book is essential for those who remember the 1E and like it(it was not broken)
4,"Colorful, broad overview of the Boeing Jetliners","An appealing look at the Boeing jet airliners from the 707 to the new CAD 777. Great photographs of the planes in flight. Includes various insignias of world airlines, and each series of plane. Unfortunately this well illustrated paperback does not include any interior shots. A fine addition to the aviation enthusiasts library"
