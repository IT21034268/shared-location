3,Thug What?,I'm from the Bay Area where Yukmouth is from....However his long awaited album will not thrill every rap fan. Tracks like Thug Money and Thug Lord are ok to listen to....while Puffin Lah and Clap Yo Hands are amazingly good heatbangers...These two tracks make the album an ok buy. Support the artist!
5,yuk is back,"at first when i listened to this album, i thought it wuz hella wack, but the reason is cuz the album has a different sound that at first seems way off and stupid, but as you listen to the album more, it seems to completely fit the music, a definite album to cop"
4,Amazing first album,"When I first listened to Chingy's song ""Right Thurr"" I must admit, I honestly didn't like it that much. But after hearing it over and over again I started to like it more and more. So I decided to buy this CD just for that song. But boy was I surprised that ""Right Thurr"" is one of my least favorites on ""Jackpot"". Some of the stand out tracks are ""He's Herre"", ""Chingy Jackpot"", ""Gettin It"", ""Bagg Up"", and ""Sample dat Ass"".All the tracks of course are great in their own way. If you're a fan of smart lyrics and a hot beat to boost, cop this CD today if you haven't already."
2,what a waste of money!,"Wow! Can't believe this guy got famous just because of ""Right Thurr""! HE SUCKS! I agree, RIGHT THURR is a fair song but this much publicity just cause of ONE song!Let's get down to the album! the ONLY ONE song i LIKED from this album is ""HOLIDAY INN""! Rest has nothing in it!Can't believe that i just wasted m 15 bucks!Below are some CDs I would like to recomend INSTEAD of this album:Grand Champ by DMXKings of Crunk by Lil Jon and East side boyzGet Rich or die tryin' by 50 CentDon't buy this one!"
3,Ching-a-Ling,"First of all I like Chingy.Okay, he ain't got no flow but he still got everbody dancin and doin the monasterie.The CD is good if you into chingy and how he rap, but if you not into Chingy don't listen to it because it isn't being forced at you.So what, he got a wierd St.Louis accent, dat is what makes him diffrent from everybody. But fa real, this CD is good.If you like Chingy,you should go buy it."
2,What to say?,"Now, I've seen all of the bad reviews this album received and I think people are hating a little too much. Now, I didn't buy the album but I did hear a couple of his songs on tv and I thought they were ok, not great, but ok. Several artists hit snags and thats exactly what happened to Chingy. He may do better next time."
2,its... aiight,"when ""right thurr"" first came on the radio in the lou waaaayy back last year, it was hot. its a great song to dance to, but i never thought he'd be bigger than local. ""holidae inn"" was tight too, but then all the pop fans hooked on to that and played it out. ""one call away"" was sort of cool on the album, but now that its on the radio 24/7 i hate it. really, the whole album isnt worth buying. get a friend to bootleg it for you so you can have some tracks for a party, but otherwise, dont waste your money. the only other good song is ""bagg up"" cuz the beat is tight, and ""sample dat ass"" and ""represent"" are okay. chingy is fine, and his songs are good for a party, plus i gotta hold it down for him a little since he's from st. louis, but truth is, he's just not that great of a rapper."
1,why do people listen to this guy,play some big L and some Ras Kass to refresh your ears and i hope he never raps again cuz he is the worst possibly ever he beats silkk the shocker in that cateogory1 of 10 lyrics 4.5 of 10 beats
3,THE FUTURE OF HIP-HOP?? HELL NO!!,"The cd is nice. I think i was better gettin the instrumentals. The beats are bass driven, which i like, i love bass. As far as the lyrics, its so....right now. His style is original but everything he's saying i've heard before. It's not unique enough to take hip-hop to the next level. He has a couple of good songs like ""One Call Away"" (a cross between nelly's dilemma and Jay-Z's excuse me miss) i love the hook, ""Right Thurr (remix) and Wurrs My Cash (it sounds like snoop doggs ""cousin"" Big Jeffery teamed up with trak stars and made a hit."
1,Just another overrated rapper with connections,"I don't understand the whole Chingy thing and why this guy is so enormously popular. Basically this guy is just like Nelly in that his style is slick and Top 40 ready, but at least Nelly has a somewhat unique flow - there's really nothing distinctive about Chingy whatsoever. The guy lacks talent to the point where he needs other rappers to keep his songs afloat - I think that pretty much says it all.And much like other St. Louis rappers, besides favoring an easily digestible Top 40 style, he also favors the ""chicks, blunts and forties"" approach to lyrics, which means that you can expect the entire album to be lacking in substance. There's one song that is decent because of the interplay between the rappers - the grossly misspelled ""Holidae In"" - but that's about it.In summary: This guy says nothing new and brings nothing new to the table - he's just another inconsequential MC."
2,"D*mn, I Tried","O.K. Chingy might be the hottest artist out right now, but d*mn. A friend of mine (from STL) always brings up the fact that I think rap music (not hip-hop) is garbage. He brought up a good point by mentioning the fact that I don't always give everything a fair chance. With that said, I borrowed his Chingy CD and gave it a listen. After one listen, I knew my assumption was right all along. This guy isn't that good. He has no substance, storytelling ability, ill metaphors or similes, nothing. I'm not hatin' on the brother because he is doing his thing, but he's really not that good. As far as the CD goes, it's bearable (that's a compliment)."
2,Original?,"This album is one of the least original albums to come out of 2003. Others include The Young and the Hopeless and others, but Chingy is rapping what most rappers rap about:girls, weed, and being rich in da hood. By now, everyone should know that the best artists in rap/hip-hop are not rapping along the same lines as Chingy.Chingy not only raps and looks like an overused Nelly clone, but he also has an indistinct voice that sounds like too many rappers. To succeed in the game, you have to have some fresh sounds when rapping.I can't tell you everything bad about this album, I can only tell you that there are one or maybe two good tracks on the album."
2,I don't usually hate...,"Got this album for free at a prommotional event, and I was excited because I was just about to go out and pick it up. Let's just say that event saved me $20. Chingy brings the beauty of superficial rap to life with this joke of an album. Basically, One Call Away saved it the embarrassment of 1 star. Really isn't a good album, unless your into mainstream, teeny bopper rap."
1,sucks,this is cd is the worse thing i have ever heard do not waste your money on this. i would much rather burn a 20 dollar bill then use it to buy this cd.
1,great stopper,"i found that by wedging this cd (which i got for 20 cents in a bargain bin during a closeout sale) i can stop the wind from blowing through the gap between the wall and the window. when i get more money i'm gonna call a carpenter and fix up the house, but for now this album does the trick. worth ever penny i paid for it."
2,"i could have given more stars, but ...","this is album sooo corny & formulaic & trite. i appreciate a good hip-POP album as much as the next man (i have all of Luda's albums), but this is just too contrived. Holidae In and Right Thurr are as good as it gets with this album. there are 2 or 3 others decent similar sounding songs (sample dat ass, gettin in, he's herre), but from there it goes down hill. the entire album is repetitive AND i have now permanently sworn off St Louis rap. Chingy reminds of us the sins of Nelly against hip hop.and this mispelling gimmick sums up this whole album, 1 big silly gimmick. im gonna give this disc to my 14-yr old cousin."
1,What has rap turned into?,"First of all - this is not rap! This is pop. Just another St. Louie artist. The only STL artist that i give props to is Nelly, cause he started it. Chingy sounds like Eminem if he was from the ""derrty"" south. This album is garbage. The whole STL rap scene is garbage. The first single ""Right Thurr"" ... first time i saw the video i thought it was making fun of Nelly. Haha. Listen to how corny his lyrics are ""give me what u got for a porkchop, she threw it at me as if i was a shortstop,"" what is that. This is perfect for a 14 year old girl to dance to in her bedroom. If you want real rap listen to that new DMX joint ""where the hood at,"" and stay away from this mainstream bull... i dont know bout you but i think right thurr is a really annoying and played out song. WARNING: DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, YOU CAN GET MORE JOY OUT OF A BOTTLE OF CHOCOLATE MILK!!!"
1,Bad Stuff,"Rap is in a world of trouble, and Chingy is one of the reasons why. Just listening to this makes me long for the late 80's and early 90's hip hop. There's no real creativity or intelligence here. Don't do it!"
1,"It sucks man,but rap is dying out like Basic Cable","Rappers like this piece of S***,him and Nelly,all that southern bull is the reason rap is flockin,one of theese days 50 and Jaare gonna end up like big n pac.What i do is,i be honest is i listen to rap and rock,also thats played out if you want to wath thoose new bands and there videos watch Fuse,but anyway i may belaughed at n S*** but i listen to rap from the 90's and the early 2000's cause there aint jack S*** out there but bubble GumM.C.,s.Anyway lets get back to Chingy,the only good major release he has is that Jackpot BullS***.Plus his F***** style isannoying he sounds like a chipmunk on Helium.Anyway if you like underground rap go cop some music from Aesop Rock,Murs,Wordsworth,MF Doom,but please avoid this S*** at any cause.P.S. HAPPY NEW YEAR 2006!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I Love the Izone,"I recieved the Polaroid Izone camera for Christmas last year. So far, I am happy with the results. Pictures are fun and easy to take. I can stick them almost anywhere. However, sometimes the pictures don't stick and are often hard to see because they're so small. It was also difficult to get the right amount of light. I had to experiment for a while before I could get the pictures to turn out right, but now that I have the hang of it, I love my Izone!"
3,Camera Worth the Price - Film is another matter,"I recommend this camera for kids and for young teenagers - with some reservations. The pictures are not great, but the kids will have great fun. At $19.99 the price is not an issue. Where Polaroid makes money is on the sticky back film. It can get expensive to buy the film real soon. This is the main reason for the three stars. Should Polaroid come up with a cheaper film I will be happy to revise my rating."
3,"It's a great camera, but one bad thing almost ruins it all","the CAMERA is great, but the film costs almost $1.00 PER picture, plus the pictures are about the size of the cotton on a bandage. If your'e a child, then I'd advise you to get a normal camera, not everything has to be instant.Pro: it's instant Con: film costs alot. normal camera pro: film doesn't cost alot Con: is'nt instant and may take quite a few days to arrive."
1,Not like other polaroids,"this was abig disappointment. The photos do not come out automatically like our regular Polaroid. This was a birthday present for my daughter and the first time out she pulled and three photos came straight out and did not tear off in between. I thoguht she'd be taking photos and sticking them everywhere, but the thing is gathering dust in a drawer somewhere."
5,child guidance is suggested,i find the berenstain bears book collection educational. this one was (surprisingly) an eye-opener for me as a parent as well. i followed the tip given here to stop my child from bitting his fingernails - and it worked.
4,"Great book for kids with a ""Bad Habit""","We got this book to help us teach our 2 1/2 year old that it was a ""bad habit"" to suck on her fingers. We started with the book for a week, then moved on to Mavala STOP nail polish. It worked! She was a SERIOUS finger sucker, and after 3 days of the Mavala and the support of the book, she no longer sucks on her fingers. She even states, ""It's a bad habit."" She loved the book and I am ordering some of the other titles that my family can relate to."
5,Love these books,Best purchase ever for young kids. I love how they have lessons to be taught in all of there books.
4,Watch out for your funny bone,"Don't read this book on the tube, Metro or anywhere in public. That is my advice, born from experience. This is an incredibly funny book, combined with some biting social commentary, for example, of Australia's relations to its Aboriginal population.This is not a novel but a collection of short stories. When you read it, you can almost imagine sitting around the campfire with the old committed socialist telling these great yarns while drinking down the ""coolabah"".Go and get it. Just a shame that's out of print. I reckon an inspired publisher could do well republishing it."
4,"Very good, but editor's judgment biased?","I found this collection to be quite through and wide-ranging, overall very good. The only criticism I have is that the editor and publisher display a Great Britain bias. Numerous speeches by members of Parliamant, etc. are included, despite their seemingly limited subject matter and relative lack of eloquence. I would have preferred that other speakers from around the world have their presence included or increased or, simply, to have had these speeches omitted.That said, however, I reiterate that it is a fine edition, worth the reader's time and money."
5,Ella Vive Otra Vez En Nuestros Corazones!,"Finally an album that commemorates a memorable event in this beloved singer's life! :D This is SO special because it is live and Selena has included her fans to take part of it. I have heard all these songs on previous albums, except ""Tus Desprecios"" (until now, and I love it! It's a great cumbia-like song.) and each one of them sounds terrific! She put her corazon into them, like her father taught her. That's a beautiful thing when it comes to her music and her fans! I want to acknowledge the Quintanilla Family, Chris, and all her friends for helping her follow her dreams, her faith, and her heart!"
4,Let's not forget the rest of the people who made Selena,"Great CD, great music from a very talented lady. But all I hear is Selena, Selena, Selena. How about the rest of the band, the behind the scenes people, her family, promoters, etc.? She would be nothing without these people. So let's honor them too. And remember, Selena was a singer, an artist...not an angel. Highly recommend this CD."
3,A Great Book.. BUT,"A good book, BUT check out read Peter Lee's ""Opium Culture"", formerly published as ""The Big Smoke"" (now available on Amazon) if you want the definitive work on this subject. Peter Lee really knows his stuff and will have you captivated throughout the book!"
2,Mediocre and short-lived,"I've used my T200T 50 to 60 times over a few years. It has always been sort of sluggish and quick to fade (and my beard is far from heavy). The thing recently quit altogether. Reason I'm online right now is because I was searching for ""troubleshooting conair t200t"" and ""conair t200t repair."" (No luck so far.) I did note that Conair's website does not offer a ""contact us"" feature. Hmm."
3,How many?,Important fact is left off this description for anyone who is planning a party. How many come with the package? There are 3 pictured but...
5,Pa. Dutch Night Before Chriistmas,This is absolutely the funniest thing I've ever read. A friend reads this every Christmas Night with a Pa. Dutch accent. Cracks everyone up.
4,Doesn't matter if it was a flop,"I'm happy to see small theatre groups around the countryare scooping up this work. Many inspriring and sweet songsfill this slightly confused storyline, and you can skip pastthe few duds. Will bring cheer and a positive, clever outlookto tots around the country (and world). Thumbs up Horton!"
1,A low Point in 20 years of Theatregoing,"After seeing Seussical, I can honestly say that it tops my list as one of the WORST shows I have ever seen on Broadway. The Music was immature, Horton has no voice."
1,Horrid musical experience,"I usually enjoy most musicals in some parts, but this is the only one i have found that i can absolutely not listen too. I have made several attempts to listen to the whole things, and indevidual songs and each time i give up in frustration from the pedestrian music and lyrics, as they grate on my central nervous system. god, i hate this musical."
5,Fantastic,I ordered this CD for my granddaughter for her birthday. She loves listening to it after having seen the play locally.
4,A Superb Soundtrack for the Entire Family!,"My children (age 7 and 4) love listening to this soundtrack! The music is so ""catchy""! You will be singing the upbeat tunes all day long!!"
4,Sort of Cheap Fun,"I often buy this as a gift, especially for the 8-12 year old group. It's easy to use and the pictures aren't bad - they're about 1 X 1 1/2 inches and have the same fuzzy flattering quality of the regular size Polaroids. The film isn't cheap, though, and after the kids run through the measly 5 picture roll that's included, Mom and Dad or older kids with allowances get to shell out close to [price] for another 3-roll pack (12 pictures each). But it is fun and kids of all ages love it."
1,Used,"When I purchased this item it said it was new. When it arrived it had 2 small burn spots on it. It was meant to be a Christmas present, but I just gave it to my grandson instead.It was clean and had its tag on it, but the burns don't make it new. I was very disappointed in this item."
3,Good quality pictures but:,The Quality of the pictures is excellent but a camera like this should not be sold with a 16 MB memory card and it should have a rechargeable power pack. The recommended ( and supplied) batteries are enough for 8 MB if you use the display and about 14 MB if you only use the view finder. The rechargeable batteries are even less useful. I did not find the external power pack in your accessory list. This may solve the problem although it would be cumbersome to use an external power pack. The lens hood falls off if you are not careful as it has no locating device in forward or reverse mode.The Zoom is outstanding and the digital zoom makes this camera an excellent tool to take shots of fare away objects. Easy to use but with many useful features to find if you take the time.The rubber protector of the view finder comes loose and breaks.
1,Worse,"This battery is worse than my old one, which lasted about 5 min. (Don't waist your $) I guess I'll have to go for OEM stuff."
4,what a buy,"At first I hesitated to spend $30 on a toilet seat. But it's saved me serious cash in diapers. Once the kid knows it's ""theirs"", because we all know everything is MINE at this age :) it's easy. It was delivered 2 days after purchase, the hardware was included and separated into easy-to-see packaging, and best of all, rubber gloves! How thoughtful! Why no 5th star? It's a chore to clean. But worth it."
1,Broke after less than two months!!!!,"We happily purchased this when potty training our daughter a month and a half ago. It broke tonight, and I just found out that the return window expired two weeks ago. It is an awesome idea, and she really likes it, but with a broken hinge (the part that attaches the seat to the toilet), it isn't much good. We'll be hunting for a better quality version."
3,Family seat!,The concept is exactly what I was looking for. I didn't want a potty seat to stick out in our downstairs bathroom. This is the only one we have downstairs and I didn't want you to come in the bathroom and say someone is potty training in this household! I am a little skeptical on the strength of the seat holding up for the long run. I have kept our old seat that I took off and will be putting it back on when this faze of our lives is over! It was very easy to put on and I think my main complaint is that it is not wood and the plastic might be a little thin to hold up for a long time. Other than that I am happy!
5,"If you love the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!","If you love the movie, you'll love the soundtrack! This great-quality CD sounds amazing on a good stereo system!"
4,Another good 70's-esque soundtrack.,"Blow was a decent movie, I like this genre...and to have a good 70's movie, you need a good 70's soundtrack. This is good, but not excellent. Big props to songs by Marshall Tucker Band, ""Big Willie"" Rosario, and probably my favorite Stone's track, ""Can't you hear me Knockin'... kinda bit the Pulp Fiction jive when they put Link Wray's Rumble on it... also, where the heck was ""Connected"" by Stereo MC's? DAAAAAAmn! such a good track that was in the ads, not on the soundtrack. Big Props to adding those silly Pacific Rimmer's the ""J-Girls"". PEACE. Check out my other smash or trash's......"
5,Feel the Love,This is a beautiful compilation of music. It is also one of the better soundtracks. Just take a look at the list! A great soundtrack to a brilliant movie.
2,not as good as the movie,"This soundtrack has a few good songs on it, but I would have rather bought the individual tracks, rather than the whole CD."
1,Awful,"I love horror films and am a particularly big slasher fan, but Blood Reaper is scraping the bottom of the barrel.I'm all for independent films and low budget flicks, but this is seriously taking the piss. The acting is terrible - so much so that its a joy when the characters are offed, I was hoping they all would be - for a start, the story is non-existant - thats usually expected, but this film deserves no mercy - and stupid, the production values are terrible.During one of the death scenes, for example, there were so many inaccuracies that I was left focusing more on the mistakes made by the film makers than the film itself.A massive waste of time and - albeit not very much - money. Don't spend your money on this garbage, its not worth it."
3,eh,"Well, some are catchy, some are just annoying. A lot of it sounds the same. There style never varies a all (similarly to Linkin Park), and most of the songs go on for way to long, just when you think its over it starts up again...I can some people liking it, but make sure you listen to most of the songs to see if you'll like it...I didn't do that, stupid me."
4,Hmmm...,"Im not entirely sure what to think of these guys. the first time i heard these guys was on the radio. i said to myself ""what the hell..."" and prepared myself to change the station, but something stopped me. I listened in a little more and couldnt help but be intrigued. I am a big fan of street punk, and you can definately hear its impression on this band. They sound like a 70s punk rock/ hip hop/ hardcore band. They actually seem to have some good talent which so many new bands lack anymore. They do seem slightly generic to me but something sets them apart from the cookie cutter pop emo crap you find all over the place anymore. I still do take a good liking to them though, very catchy. I suggest anyone who is into almost any kind of music go out and purchase this cd, you wont be let down."
3,Good Product,"I got this product as a gift for my boyfriend... he loved it but, i did notice that you have to use a foam dispenser instead of a gel dispenser which i know he would have like better. Other than that i heard from him it warmed really well. Oh there's a little green light that's supposed to come on when its hot enough.. well, it only goes to yellow, i don't know if that's the way it comes but that's what we got, so far it hasn't broken down...good!"
2,Returned my Conair...,"If you have ever had and/or are looking for a traditional barbershop shave, don't bother with this supposed hot lather machine.After I finally got it working (and not spewing out handfulls of cream) I was awaiting my barbershop shave at home. What I bought was a cannister heater that provides luke warm cream at best.Returned it..."
2,This deal was a dud,"At first I thought I really found a bargain...a hot lather machine made by a company I was familiar with that didn't cost an arm and a leg. And for the first few weeks, it was great; it worked just as it was supposed to. But after 4 or 5 weeks, the lather took longer and longer to get hot, until finally it was warm at best. I followed the instructions to the letter, even changed cans of lather (just to see if that was the problem). Then, to top it off, the luke-warm lather would start coming out at the seams of the dispenser...what a mess. I again changed cans, and again the same thing would happen. All in all, only the first can worked the way it was supposed to. I deposited the machine in the trash and went on with my life."
2,Gives cold lather in less than 1 year,"When I first got this last Christmas, this was great. The lather was hot and smooth.But, as I was approaching having this machine for a year, the lather starting getting colder and colder coming out, even when the machine were turned on for longer periods of time.I just threw the machine in the trash, because today, the lather was as cold as the regular can."
3,Gets the job done but could be a lot better,"I live in an area with treacherous traffic and no bike lanes, so as a result my only means of cycling for exercise is at home. The DVD does a good job of providing great views with instrumental music that never gets in the way. On the downside though, the video is fullscreen which died out with VHS, and the worst part of all is the video constantly cuts to different scenes. You'll be enjoying a nice ride down a road when all of a sudden the camera is looking at something to the right then next thing you know it quick cuts to a completely different location or town altogether! Seeing the side mirrors of the vehicle in some shots was also a mood-killer. I would rather see a cycling video recorded by someone on a bicycle, or at the very least a motorcycle. Keep the camera pointed forward, and save the scenery that is to the sides for occasional pull-offs into rest stops or scenic spots but keep it one continuous shot rather than all these quick edits."
2,Copy Protected CD = crippled,This CD is copy protected and not labeled as such. I was unable to listen to it on two different computers and that is my only method of listening to it. I hope that Copy Protected CDs are clearly labeled in the future so I know not to buy them because I will not be able to listen to them! Its sad the way record companies treat their Paying Customers.
1,Not worth it!,"I bought it in FYE for 10 bucks. Watched the first 2 movies, well, actually, could not even finish the second movie because they are such bad quality. This should be 1.00 they are horrible to watch, audio and picture terrible. Everything black. Awful. Don't buy it"
5,A Great Parenting Tool!!,"This book is excellent for providing ""at home"" reading practice for your students. Our 4th grade teachers used this by sending one lesson home each week- due back on Friday. It was a great help for parents to understand ways to help their child while also giving students meaningful reading assignments at home. It has a space for parents to sign before the lesson is turned in, which is very helpful. The stories are also extremely engaging, with a variety of genres."
5,Back Home is a heart-warming story about a young girl.,"""Back Home"" is a heart-warming story about a young girl whowas evacuated for 5 years to America because of World War 2.The book is about the girls return to England and how shemust face the difference between America's plentiful supply'sand Englands few. Also how she has to deal with the emotionalhardships of being reunited with her family again and thebig difference between England and America's custom's. She mustalso deal with the fact is that she's being sent of to boarding school werethe girls don't like her."
4,So far so good,"I was surprised at how small this item is, (I tend to not read dimensions before I order something...bad habit) however it seems to do its job. Our dog is an 80-pound Belgian Sheepdog (maybe he's too fat to jump over it?), so it it doesn't ""just"" work for small dogs. I have a standard size, four-door sedan, and installing it wasn't a problem. I used to have to drape my arm over the passenger seat to keep my dog from standing on the console, so I'm very happy I no longer have to do that."
2,Cheaply made and doesn't work,This product is cheaply made which would be fine except that it didn't even work. On the first car ride my puppy jumped right over it with ease. It may have given her 30 seconds on hesitation but that didn't stop her.
3,good price,I bought this item in good faith since there was no description on the product page of how it attaches to your car. Bad move. You MUST have detachable headrests for this product to work. My explorer's seats are one piece with the headrest as part of the seat and the straps aren't long enough to reach around the seat. I did get a chance to try it out on a car with detachable headrests. In this situation the product performed okay. my lab set her head on the barrier a lot which loosened the straps. If she really tried to get to the front seat she could easily have done it.
4,Barrier,This barrier worked great for my Golden but the Pit bull jumped over it. Something to consider when purchasing.
5,it works,"i own this and it works. 2 straps for the headrests, 2 straps around the bottom of each seat secures the product. easy to install."
2,Unbound Hound,"My dog could, and did, hop over this barrier with ease. He seemed to think it was a traveling agility game. In the end, I trained him to stay in the back...something I should have done in the first place."
3,fell apart in 2 weeks,"This product seemed to be very good at first, but one of the strings lost the stitches and there were all the dogs again on the front seat two weeks after I bought it. Now I have to sew it myself to use it again. I guess this product would be much better if the strings that are attached to the seats were one piece (going from one seat to the other). Since it's two pieces (one for the right seat, one for the left seat), they don't support much pressure if the dog tries to pass."
3,"Hard to find, but is it REALLY worth it? It's a toss up...","Early recordings of the band. BAD recordings of the band. The sound quality is horrible, and the only thing that saves this release is the great playing by the band, and the fact that Rozz changes some of the lyrics... Well, it's disappointing, but it is a rare find..."
3,Building castles in the sand,"Three cousins inherit a beachfront cottage from their loving grandmother and all three must come to a decision as to what to do with it. Lesley is an anorexic (the poor little rich girl of the story); Bret is an alcoholic (the bad girl of the story) and Anne is a teacher who falls for married men (the stupid girl of the story). All three develop romances during the course of the story, and everything is resolved nicely. Bret's story is by far the most interesting and she is probably the best developed character."
1,poor quality,"I ordered this product and thought I was getting a great deal but this product is of poor quality. I followed manufacturers directions regarding charging time and proper usage but after it never worked, after 2 days it still did not work. I then attempted to open the battery area to check it and it stopped charging afterwards and the battery was emitting a white liquid. Conair.....Never again."
2,Poorly made product,"This product looks very nice and has a lot of features, but it doesn't last very long. It worked correctly for less than a month and shortly thereafter would not turn on. I cleaned it and did everything the manual suggested. I would not recommend this item."
3,Works well,It does what it says it does. It keeps a charge for days. But the little plastic heads break often. This is the second one we have used (the first one lasted 3 years..?) and the main head broke within a couple of months.
4,7 years of use and still running strong,"I have owned this model for the last 7 years and it still works great. I have changed the rechargeable battery out 3 times it is simple and uses over the counter AA rechargeable. It still cuts a goatee just fine. Don't buy this if you plan to trim a full beard. Buy this because you don't want to own 3 separate trimmers and like just one item on you sink top. I use the nose and eyebrow trimmer every other day, the beard attachment takes a gentle touch but will trim a small goatee easily.I admit this tries to be many things and fails at half of them. But for a $15 trimmer to work for 7 years; I think I got my money's worth."
2,WOW! I thought I was the only 1...,The trimmer seemed like a good idea in the package.. Though the blades dont cut very well.. I found yself going through the same spots over and over.. Does not work well with hair longer than 1/8 inch. So the long hair attachments in my opinion are pretty much useless. works decent for nose and eyebrow trimming.. I would spend a little more and get a different unit.
1,Bossing?,Some good information. Not worth the price. I agree with first review that this article was not what the title leads one to believe. I would not have purchased it if I'd read the review first. Shame on me.
1,Serious waste of money,"The title of this document is misleading. In fact, most of the content has nothing to do with the advertised title. Plus, what is contained in the document can be found anywhere on the Web for free. I feel foolish for making this purchase."
1,VERY DANGEROUS,"I was excited about it while it lasted. 3 Weeks. Then, all of a sudden it just crashed and took all my information wiwth it. I had the information backed up, but can't stop in the middle of the day to reload software if it decides to do this on a regular basis....."
2,Eh,"Got this item a while ago, was super excited to try it out but the chain is extremely short and hard to even connect it from the top of my ear to the actual ear piercing. Wish I had not spent my money on this."
2,Highly acclaimed. Terribly dull.,"This book is touted as one of the highest level books written by a deaf man. It does contain a lot of good information, but I found it to be pretentious and incredibly dull. I feel if you wish to make a point, you should go ahead and make it; not go broke using ten-dollar words as often as possible. No wonder this book is so unbelievably expensive. I would not recommend this book to friends. I wish I could, as I said before, it's got a lot of good information in it. It's just unfortunately like digging for a needle in a haystack."
3,Breaks too easily,"Great concept - my daughter loved, loved, loved the animals, but they started breaking on the second day. First the tails break off (and there is no way to reattach). Then the limbs start coming off, then a bear's head fell off. The problem seems to be that they are made of brittle plastic, with moveable parts, and they are just too brittle to keep the moving functions working."
4,North American Trek Eco Expedition,"The product may very well rate 5 stars, but I reserve the top rating for perfection. The recipient of the gift seems to rate it a 10. He has been playing with it steadily since Christmas. I will look for the others in this series. I am impressed with the workmanship and detail."
4,Its a great deal for the price,"This is not the top of the line receiver or speaker, but its a pretty good deal for the money, The DVR works great and makes life easier."
1,Far below expectations,"I was looking forward to receiving this because not only does it receive cable tv signals, it can handle FM radio as well. First, the good: the radio was fine. The bad: cable reception was very fuzzy, and the sound was bad. Every once in a while things would clear up for a few seconds, but even then the video was jumpy. I installed this in a very high end desktop system, so any argument about the video card being unable to keep up won't hold water.I've returned this to amazon.com and am probably going to try to order a replacement card, but a different brand and model. The documentation for this product was also sub-par and gave very little in the way of troubleshooting advice."
5,STEVENS,"THE BLOCKS ARE EXACTLY LIKE THEY ARE DESCRIBED, IN FACT, I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED AT JUST HOW DURABLE THEY REALLY ARE. VERY TOUGH, PLASTIC"
5,Absolutely great,The product arrived on time. Very happy with the purchase. Quality of the item was good as well. The kids enjoyed it.
3,A quiet life,"This is a very peaceful and introspective book about a quiet life on a small farm, living in a house that the author built for himself as a very young man. He has kept a detailed diary of the weather and other occurrences of his farm and puts some excerpts in each chapter, and this to me shows his pleasure in the small things that make up everyday life on a farm. He earns some outside money by selling honey and some milk, and doing a little substitute teaching, but otherwise he is self-sufficient. It does make me wonder a bit if he is sometimes lonely..."
2,Sad attempt at a pop album.,"I'm a big Jude fan, but I want my [money] back. His previous work was deep and moving. This album is filled with sorry attempts to get radio air play. He repeats the title song twice and both are pretty bad offerings. He even includes a lesser version of a song released on his previous album. I continue to say that I will never again buy an album without hearing it first; this time I mean it. Jude, please give me my money back."
1,A very poor follow on from No One is Really Beautiful,Noone is really beautiful quickly became one of my favourite disks of all time. This one unfortunately became instantly one of the worst. So bad in fact I felt upset to have paid for it. So I binned it.Jude can and does do much better than this.
1,Poor Effort,"I have followed the champ's career for almost forty years. This is clearly the worst book ever written about him. And it is very poorly written. What were these guys thinking! I'm sure Ali would not approve of the many factual errors, not to mention the way the information is presented. It's obvious that the writers did not interview Ali. If you want to read an accurate portrayal of Ali's life stay away from this book. There are many others out there that are worth buying. This one is not even worth the paper it is written on."
5,"Finally, a true portrait","Wow, finally a book that gives more than the usual boxing cliches about Ali. This book tells about the other side of Ali, the crusader for justice who took an incredibly courageous stand against the Vietnam War and risked going to prison for his beliefs.The average boxing fan probably won't like it because it doesn't talk much about Ali as a boxer but rather gives us some political insights that most boxing fans are probably too conservative or apolitical to appreciate.It's a truly fascinating book, very well written and it explodes a lot of the myths about Ali because it is co-wriiten by Ali's best friend Howard Bingham, one of the only people who knows what really happened. Read this book!"
5,Good Songs,"I've listened to the Rolling Stones for some time and have to admit, I like it. Once you start listening, those songs stick inside your head. It doesn't have all their songs but that is okay. The CD is still good to listen to. If you are a die-hard fan of The Rolling Stones, you might have to wait for a case of all their hits like they have done with Led Zeppelin."
1,waste of money,"if you want the best of the rolling stones, do yourself a favour and buy ""hot rocks"" and ""rewind"" instead...hot rocks has all of the essentials from the 60's and early 70's, and rewind covers the late 70's and early 80's...after this period, the stones stopped writing good songs and simply regurgitated their past successful formula, which is evident on forty licks...don't get me wrong, i love the stones, but forty licks is an unnecessary compilation, as the new songs are bad and all the good stuff is available on hot rocks and rewind, and this is why i feel it only deserves 1 star."
4,Solid Overview of the Stones,"This two disc set is definately a good overview of the long and illustrious career of the Rolling Stones. It includes most every major hit the Stones had from their entire run, which is nice, however, a few more rarely heard gems would be nice. The new songs on the album are not all that great, and jseem to be there just to be able to put a few new tracks on the album, which is what is all the rage these days. OTherwise, this is a solid hits collection worth buying."
2,They could have fit full length tracks !,"I agree, that I want full length tracks on compilations.A 'corrected version' or maybe it should be called 'bonus tracks', can be made.If you have the needed original album tracks , it's just a matter of inserting these on blank media.Here are the tracks.Four songs:1. Miss You2. Beast of Burden3. Emotional Rescue4. It's Only Rock & RollThe running time is 80 minutes & would have fit on CD2.Another record company rip-off, to encourage fans to buy the complete albums, with the full length songs.I will also give a diminished rating to this release, for theshave on quality running time.I'd recommend Hot Rocks & Jump Back, as alternatives for better quality."
2,EDITED VERSIONS!,"I've been a die-hard Stones fan for many years and was excited to have all these great songs in one collection. But be advised, many songs on the second disc are EDITED VERSIONS!!!! Call me a ... music geek, but when I listen the the world's greatest Rock & Roll band, I wanna hear the songs the way they were intended to be heard!!! The WHOLE song, not some EDITED version!!!! The new songs are real good and maybe ""Dont Stop"" will come out as a single; Keith's ballad is great, too! But it's hard for me to listen to songs that I know have more to them! I hate when they EDIT songs just so they can cram a bunch onto one disc!!!! Forty Licks shoulda been 3 discs, it's that simple. And even if someone is new to the Stones, they should hear the REAL, ORIGANINAL versions!!! Disc one is okay, but disc two, not so much!! Just wanna let people know; fair warning . . . . . ."
4,"Where the is 'Harlem Shuffle', 'Can't You Hear me Knocking?","Let's point out a simple fact: This is a cash in for the Stones cash register.But why on earth would they add three mediocre songs that could have been replaced with 'Salt of the Earth', Harlem Shuffle, and Can't You Hear Me Knocking ?"
4,All you will Ever Need from them,"there is no denying the Rolling Stones had some Great songs&a Great run.I use to like them more along time ago but over time they got too boring&never changed there style or vibe&I pretty much lost interest in them&I cringe when they are given this title as ""WORLD'S Greatest Band""?? more like WOrld's Safest Band.but on the Bright side is this Compilation that has all the Songs that I enjoy by them&that for me is more than enough.the problem is the new songs which sound just like everything else they have done over the past 25 years.but for ""Ruby Tuesday"",""Miss You"", ""Beast of Burden"",""Emotional Rescue"",etc..those are my Cuts from them."
5,Rolling Stones,"This is the only stones album I own, and if you only get one album by these guys, this is it. What I normally do in my reviews is give them a song-by-song review, but all 40 songs on this compilation are great! Each would be 5 stars. I highly recommend this album to anyone."
3,Find a better collection,"This has most of the Stones' hits but a few key songs are missing. Where's ""She's so Cold"" or ""Waitin' on a Friend""?I got this because I like their hits and thought a few extra songs would be good, too. I was wrong. Titles that you don't recognize on this disc are not good. Their four new songs are terrible.There are 25 great songs here, but what can you do with the other 15. Find a better collection."
4,You Can't Fit 'em All.,"I was very impressed with the number of songs on this compilation. There has been much discussion concerning what was left off. ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"" gets my vote for most glaring omission. ""Out Of Time"" finishes a close second mainly because most of us in that generation remember that as the song from ""Coming Home"". ""Time Is On My Side"", ""Tell Me"", and ""Lady Jane"" deserve Honorable Mention. Still, even with those songs left off, it is probably the most impressive hits package around, the Elvis 30 #1 Hits pkg. not withstanding."
5,Forty Licks,"The Rolling Stones Forty Licks contains forty of the Rolling Stones biggest hit singles from the last 40 odd years. Forty Licks is the ideal purchase for the casual stones fan who doesn't want to purchase all of their albums, but wants more than Hot Rocks. Some songs may be editied, but Forty Licks is still an excellent double disc overview of The Rolling Stones career. The sound quality is also very good, much better than that of the Hot Rocks set. Forty Licks does not contain all the Stones that you'll need, but it is a good starting place for fans who do not own any Rolling Stones cds."
3,so-so-stones,"I bought it just to have a convenient best of for my car. Some of the songs are some of their best, and some I would hardly classify as greatest hits and then there are 4 new songs that all sound alike, and like what the Stones have been sounding since Steel Wheels.The Stones haven't done anything original in years but no band in the world can match them for their recycling output."
2,Silliest Band in The Land,"This band is very silly. They have elephant-sized egos (Like calling THEMSELVES 'the greatest rock n roll band'), and just their music is overall silly and overrated. They were all right in the beginning, because they were more of a hard rock band then. But they continued churning out an annoying brand of pop, which can really get on nerves. But if ya have to get a Rolling Stones album, I guess this would be the one."
3,Haley Mills in an Erotic Thriller,"Mis Haley Mills made this erotic thriller somewhat later in her career. Wanting to make the move from the genre of her earlier films, she chose an erotic murder myster featuring adult themes, including voyuerism. Throughout the film she willingly sheds her innocence and clothing. If you've always wondered what the star of Pollyanna, Summer Magic, and other Disney greats looks like smoking and nude this is your ticket."
3,"lots of potential, could do better","Yanoff's book has become something of a standard in this part of the world for want of a suitable replacement. There is no doubt it has good coverage of the topic, the colour photos are of good quality and distinguish it from much of the competition, and the text is generally detailed and informative. However the organisation and layout of the book are often confused and confusing. The index falls well short of what is expected and is often a source of great frustration.Hopefully a new edition will correct these failings and secure a more-deserved first choice status for this book."
3,Decent but nothing new,"I'd never heard Ben Harper before I bought this CD but I heard him on a radio interview and I liked his personality so I thought I would give him a chance. I dig the first tune. It's a pretty fresh raggae sound and was blown away by the guitar work and soul sound of the second song. Everything after that was decent but nothing spectacular. It's like the songs weren't necessarily thrown together but just music that wasn't developed as well as the lyrics, which are decent. After track two he lost me and the music fell background to my thoughts. I heard a lick here and there and he has an amazingly distinct sound to his voice but the majority of the music on this disc is nothing special and actually does well at drawing your attention away from listening. He lasted one rotation and I'll give it another play just to make sure I'm not missing anything and then I'm going to put JSBX back on and get down!"
3,Not the best of Ben but good,Only a few good songs compared to his other albums and he's seemed to transition into a Paul Weller style.
1,beef,beef beef beef. beef. beef beef. beef beef beef beef beef beef beef beef beef. beef. beef beef beef.
1,Completely Unreliable,"I don't know if this player is still being sold but if so, steer clear of it. When it works, mine works reasonably well but it rarely works. Most of the time it gives me a ""no disc"" message when it has just spooled up a DVD that works in every other player I have.More interesting is GE's response to this. They don't acknowledge that it even exists. Could it be some kind of illegal copy, I ask? No response. I think they know there's something wrong with it.The only good thing about it was the price, but on a per-play basis, I probably should have bought a different player. What also bothers me is what this says about GE. Would this be true of all their other products? I wonder."
1,frantikcd not my favorite cd,"this cd was not my favorite it of wwmt. i really liked all there other cds prior to this one. I was dissapointed that it was not the techno dance stuff, like the jumping in the house cds."
2,Personal Journal,"Wilber seems very intelligent - probably highly evolved intellectually. I think of this as a wonderful result of the flow of Kundalini Energy which is very different from Spiritual Energy. I failed to find evidence of humility, and simplicity and compassion in the book (qualities of spirituality)so I would have labeled it as: Daily Reflections on A Highly Intelligent Life."
2,stuck in the movies,"The title of the book I read is Creature Features. The first thing that happened in my story is four boys named Simon, Nate, Albert, and Jon go into an old run down drive-in theatre. Then the boys started playing with the projector and get sucked into the films. They have to run away from monsters. Simon somehow gets zapped out when switching to a different movie. Simon can't just turn off the projector because when ever you touch it, it shocks you. The ending was one of the major reasons why I didn't like the book. The ending was Simon just unplugged the projector. Then the three other kids just fall out of the screen but the monsters fall out too and in a movie length of time the monsters just disappeared. The author should have explained why the projector shocked him and I think the author should have put more thought in to the ending. I rated this book a 2 out of 5 stars."
5,Compact and comfortable!,"These are great! The inside is soft and comfortable next to your skin. These are lightweight and streamlined, unlike my old ones which are big, heavy and uncomfortable. I use these periodically when my Carpal Tunnel Syndrome flares up. These are comfortable to wear, yet supply the support needed with the metal insert. They would work well for Tendonitus as well. I highly recommend these."
3,"good to watch, but not the best.",A typical 80's horror flick which by today's standards in this genre is somewhat comical. It's a good movie to watch on a lazy saturday afternoon when it's raining outside and ya don't feel like going anywhere.
2,The Haunted Casino,"A group of friends head out to a run-down casino off the beaten path that was left to them as part of their inheritance, but they soon discover that some of the debts were never paid when a pair of ghosts come to collect their souls! Full Moon scream queen Robin Sydney headlines once again opposite Sid Haig and Michael Berryman, who play the casino's rambunctious spirits. THE HAUNTED CASINO gets off to a disastrously slow start, with no real haunts for close to an hour. After that, there are few scares and very little action, but Charles Band still delivers enough gore and light humor to keep his fans interested until the end. The only interesting character becomes Rico Simonini's undead BlackJack Dealer, who brings to mind the coercive Lloyd the Bartender from Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING. Also known as DEAD MAN'S HAND: CASINO OF THE DAMNED.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,Very BEST of Bluegrass,"This three CD box does represent the best by several of the founders of Bluegrass, including its amazing Father - Bill Monroe. The well known Mr. Monroe, The Stanley Brothers, Flatt and Scruggs and Jim and Jesse are here at their best. The suprise may be the band of the Lilly Brothers, Don Stover and Tex Logan. The music they play here further documents that their music was in a league with these other wonderful early bands. The music of the Lilly Brothers is a hidden gem - as was the music of Monroe and these other now prominent bluegrass bands for too long. Hylo Brown and Hazel and Alice give performances worthy of the title - Best of Bluegrass too. In fact, all the music in this set is truly beautiful!"
5,"Hands down, the best criticism of Faulkner's works","If you are engaged by Faulkner's works and seek the insights of a guide through Billy's Yoknapatawpha country, look no further. Through the decades this is my most trusted Faulkner companion. While I am not a scholar, I have been reading and rereading Billy's works and more than any other author (I've been reading for 50 years) I feel an affinity for his books, to the point I have subscribed to email lists populated by Faulkner scholars.So, while many scholars have approached Billy's works, none (in my humble estimation) surpass Cleanth's insights.Dedicated to Robert Penn Warren, it contains 13 essays devoted to Faulkner's major works, and three offerings on qualities of Faulkner's works. The writing is clear and accessible, not at all cluttered with the multi-syllabic gibberish that characterizes so much scholarship."
1,More Cult Fodder,"More crap writing from Flora designed to make the reader believe she's got all the answers. Flora automatically assumes all readers are spiritually confused morons who need her to dumb down all things metaphysical. She makes much ado about gurus keeping the masses down with their complicated talk, then proceeds to attempt to snare readers into her cult where they can become dependent on her! Shame, shame, tsk, tsk!"
1,Disappointed in Eastbay,"I ordered this item through Amazon from Eastbay. Watch out on this one -- the picture on the Amazon web site does not update when you do your radio button selection, you end up ordering the ""wrong color"", you return it and get charged for the shipping for the enclosed ""return mail paste-on"" voucher. That despite writing a note asking Eastbay not to charge me and telling them about the failure of the website to update the picture when completing the order (so I would have known I was ordering a different color than the one shown)."
2,"Very good, if we were in 1980","Here in Brazil, I read this book, thirty years ago, when I was a child. Well, if we were in 1980, I'll would give four stars for this book. Well, we are in 2010 and I have to give two stars for it.This book has many things that became corrects. Others became an absurd future."
3,Good but not great,"In the first wave, power came from violence or force. In the second, the Industrial Revolution, power came from wealth. Today, it comes from knowledge. The battle for the future is going to be over information. Unfortunately, the book takes 500 pages to say that.Toffler's other books are stronger and if short on time, can be read in exchange for The Third Wave. However Alvin does write a particularly touching foreword about his wife who has been his long time writing partner."
4,VISIONARY,"The book was published in the the early 1980's. The situations and examples given by Toffoler , though excellent, cannot be well appreciated by us as they seem out of palce in current times. However we must give Tofler his due for his predictions of the future. Even back in the 1980's ,when he wrote the book, he has rightly predicted the break up the USSR and emergence of the 'EURO'. I would'nt recommend this book as a ""must read"", but anyone with a literary interest and the patience must invest in this book."
4,I've read a bunch of historical mysteries,"This book is a tremendous mix of history and mystery. The characters are well drawn, and the author allows glimpses of Tudor England without overwhelming the reader. The mystery is well thought out and unlike many actually makes sense. One only hopes the author produces more in the series. I'd also reccomend P.F. Chisholm for Elizabethan England and Owen Parry for the American Civil War."
4,Good Mystery/Suspense Novel,"I enjoyed this book very much. It will certainly please the myriads of historical crime novels. Period crime novels are probably at their highest level for many years and this is certainly one of the better ones. Not a classic but certainly a very enjoyable and interesting read.1540 and Mathew Shardlake, believes that he has put himself out of favour with the flinty Thomas Cromwell. Matthew is trying to give his full attention to his legal practice and stay out of the way of one of England's most powerful men without success. His involvement in a murder case once again brings him into close contact with the King's chief minister and a new assignment.The secret formula for Greek Fire, a legendary substance that creates fire that cannot be extinguished by any known means has been uncovered in a London monastery and Matthew is sent to recover it, but he soon finds out that everything is not as it would seem . . ."
3,Dark Fire - a slow burn,"Christopher Sansom's first book, Dissolution, is a great read. Gripping, fast moving with a new twist in every chapter. Dark Fire: A Novel is also a good read, but for me, it was a little slower. Several of the plot lines didn't really seem to make sense. For example, it was clear early in the novel that a couple of conspicous villains needed interrogating. So why couldn't, arguably one of the most powerful men in the world at that time, Thomas Cromwell, provide our two hero protagonists Shardlake and Barak with a few soldiers to get the job done?Overall I enjoyed the book a lot - but I think it could have been vastly improved with a bit more editing."
2,A lot of filler to say the least...,"Yes, many have noted that the music here is not necessarily in the movie itself...but then again that's why there are two soundtracks for this film. This is the rap infused soundtrack that exists mainly because Ja Rule appears in the movie. That said, Ja Rule provides really the only track here that's worth listening to. His `Furious' (which appears on his album under another not so nice name) is the only track I really liked here. The Limp Bizkit remix was never better than the original, and the random tracks by almost every other rapper are just filler at best. Ashanti was nice to see, she's always great, as is Faith Evans, and I found myself starting to like the track by Caddillac Tah, but all in all this is just another compilation of tracks by artists you probably wouldn't listen to had they not been on this soundtrack."
2,Question about a song title,Does anyone know the name to the music playing at the beginning of the movie where Paul Walker is first seen testing the speed of his Eclipse in that parking lot looking area? Please let me know or email me a shockg2000@excite.com
1,How to waste your money...,"We are talking about the same movie? When this people release a score music album of this great movie, please someone tell me.Even the ""more music soundtrack"" left me waiting for the real thing."
1,not worth anyone's money,"When I bought this soundtrack, I expected to hear all the phat techno beats that dominated the background in the movie, but all there is is Ja Rule popping up in almost every song. I think the only reason they put him in the movie is so they could give us a Ja Rule album instead of a soundtrack. It doesn't even have the song that's playing when Vince and Brian get in that fight in the beginning of the movie, and that's the entire reason I bought the CD! I'm still hoping they'll come out with a ""More Music from the Fast and the Furious"" disc. Or at least a score or something. The soundtrack that's out now is just a disappointment."
4,Song Missing,"Hello yes I would like to know what's the name of the song that is played on the movie when Bryan arrives at torreto's to eat a tuna sandwich it goes someway like that ""Tell me baby""thanks and God bless us all"
1,Stay away from this album,"I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some:NO!!!Don'tBadStay Away from itI told you, NO!!!In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or something"
1,title of song in movie wanted,like many others i bought this cd expecting to hear songs from the movie. anyways i was after the song played during track 15 of the movie. It is a very dancy track its at the very start of track 15 where they are at race wars and brain goes looking for mia but finds out that Toretto and his gang have gone to do another job.
5,Hot Sound Track!,"Although the songs are'nt related to the movie in any way,which I guess doesnt really matter, the album is really good.Its different sounds on each track."
1,shawna- say aah,"Hey, did anyone find the song shawna- say ahh? Does it have a different name or something? that song is so hot"
2,Where?,"I recently saw this movie again and thought ""I should get this soundtrack"" I expected songs like Dope's ""Debonair"" and others that were in the film to be on there, but I expected too much. If you like rap, pick it up, if not, move on."
2,Not the real music,"This quite (stinks), i liked a lot the movie, and also the soundtrack, but this soundtrack just (stinks), i liked only ""Rollin"" by Limp Bizkit, but they also forgot another song from them which is ""My Way"", i am not a fan of Limp Bizkit, but this soundtrack simply (stinks), if you want to hear the real soundtrack for the movie, see the film."
1,Who is BT and where is his music?,"After seeing Fast & Furious twice, I am dying to get the real music, which unfortunately, isn't on the Soundtrack CD. The credits say BT (whoever or whatever that is) wrote the soundtrack, and there is some GREAT techno and background music, plus some really good songs which don't show up at all on the CD. Is some company like VareseSarabande going to release the REAL soundtrack? (Any record execs reading this?)"
3,Entertaining,"This book as an entertainment value is good, although a bit slow at times. Some of the scenes seem very coincidental indeed and the main male protagonist is show having almost superhuman qualities. Don't look much further from entertainment though."
4,Just as good the second time through.,"A set of appealing and well developed characters inhabit a rather improbable plot that is peppered with an old unsolved murder, smugglers, Bow Street runners, and a smiling villain. The dialog is some of Heyer's best, as are her portrayals of the older of the two romantic couples especially. I'm in the process of rereading all of Georgette Heyer's historical romance novels, and I definitely rank this as one of the better ones."
2,"Looks great,performs less so","I unintentionally gave my new Milwaukee radio a reception comparison with my shop radio,and the Milwaukee failed miserably.I had a radio going in my shop. I decided I should try the new Milwaukee radio that had arrived the previous day.The old shop radio was set on a Boston FM Public station(Boston is about 45 miles away). I sat the Milwaukee alongside the shop radio and turned to the same station. To my chagrin,the macho looking Milwaukee was barely recieving the station that came in quite clearly on the shop radio. Since [price] is a lot more than I've ever paid for a jobsite radio,I decided I didn't want one with poor reception,and immediately returned the Milwaukee.I could not recommend this tool!"
5,A good anthology on Black Film,"From the early pioneers of Black Film like Oscar Micheaux in the 1930's to the present day era of filmmakers including Spike Lee, this book adequately covers it all, with a fair amount of time devoted on independent cinema. Interesting read. Especially useful for the academic world."
1,Unreliable phone,"I have had many problems with this phone and with Cingular service. Sometimes, when my friends call, they do not get my voice mail, they do not get ringing- they get dead air (or sometimes one of those evil prerecorded messages like Message GL 23 blah).As for the phone itself, it developed this problem of the sound going out. The person I was talking to could hear me, but I had complete silence from them. Then if I tapped the phone or made a noise, the sound would come back (so obviously, this was not just me having the volume down too low). The reception is also terrible in my area of Central Florida with this phone.I got a different phone (Nokia 3595) and it has worked a lot better so far. Much better reception in my area, none of those sound problems.Overall, I was very disappointed with this Ericsson phone. I had the T60d before and it always worked really well, but the T226 just is not very good."
2,Uh...?,"It's not that this is a bad phone. It just had a lot of glitches, freeze spots, processor slow-downs, etc. I guess Sony Ericsson didn't quite test this one as well as it should have. There are plenty of free phones out there, but avoid this one. It has an updated counterpart, if you want to look into that."
3,Going thru the motions,"Was real excited to get this CD, but after I got it was very dissapionted. Excellent performances, but totally lack the urgency, explosiveness of the originals. Sounds like old men going thru the songs as if they are old standards at a wedding. Redue early Beck performances ? - good luck! Limp train kept a rolling.New guest guitarist add nothing to the tracks. Still a halfway decent effort, but I would rather listen to the originals."
2,Unnecessary re-makes,"This album confirms that the McCarty/Dreja rythm section still have it after 35 yrs and really were the heart of the Yardbirds sound.It also shows how talented, timeless, and creative the group was.But, unfortunately, these re-makes are intended to provide the fret-shredding audience the rare treat of quality material and is unlikely to establish any affinity elsewhere."
1,This is a lousy book!,"I like poetry, but the poems in this book are all written in the same style. There is no creativity shown, and no real variation. I have yet to find a person who liked this book. ""Jump city"", the poem from which the title was drawn, is the second worst poem I have ever read."
2,Not quite what I needed,"This didn't have enough ""poop"" to blow my twin air horns so I ended up not using it. I am not sure what it is really capable of doing."
1,spend your money elsewhere.,"The choice of songs isn't bad, and the performance is ok, but the recording quality of this album is awful. If you want good live recording, iconologia is much better."
2,Where is the action???,"Thankfully, I only rented this game! I am not going to write a huge review, but i just would like to point out why you should avoid this game at all costs. The graphics only look modestly better then a regular ps1 title. There is no sense of being in the game. When I selected Michigan State to play Duke at Cameran Indoor Stadium...there was no sense of the wild and crazy atmosphere you would expect from 2 great schools with basketball tradition. Where were the Duke Crazies? So i shut the game off and never played it again. Please Please PLease!! Save your money! 989 better get their stuff together if they want to stay in business. They are facing stiff competition especially considering Sega Sports is now providing titles for the ps2."
5,NCAA Final Four 2001,"This is an excellent game and it has all you need for a college basketball game. If anyone tells you that this game sucks and you shouldn't buy it, don't listen to them. You are able to work your way up through the top 25 and compete for the title. The gameplay is quick, and the controls are easy to master. I've played both nba live 2001 and this game, and final four is MUCH better. When I bought it I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but after 3 weeks of playing this game, I still like to play whenever I can. This game definately met my expectations and it should make yours."
2,i dunno bout this one,i am not a big fan of this game. i love basketball and basketball games on systems. but this game has very slow gameplay and is much to easy. you can score like 60 points with one player in a game. the good thing about this game is all the teams you can be. but all in all dont buy this game if you have never played it before. save your money and wait till nba live comes out
1,GArbage!,Garbage!............I gave it the benefit of the doubt..and gave this game chance. (Didn't believe any of these owners ratings)..I figured that its impossible for any ps2 game to be that bad........Guess what it's all true...and I'm out 50 some bucks....don't have second thoughts.....Be patient!
5,ACE OF BASE RULES WITH DA CAPO,"Once again, Ace of Base has outstandingly triumphed with DA CAPO, their first album in quite some time. Filled with uplifting, groovy tracks, Da Capo will lift you right out of your seat and have you dancing along in no time. The first four tracks are incredible. Unspeakable, Beautiful Morning, Remember the Words, and Da Capo are a terrific set of songs. The following songs are also impressive: World Down Under, Ordinary Day, Wonderful Life (great track!), Show Me Love, What's the Name of the Game, Change with the Light, Hey Darling, and The Juvenile. On this album, there are special extra bonus tracks which you won't want to miss! BUY THIS ALBUM! You will never regret it! Ace of Base may not be in the U.S., but if you don't have Da Capo, your AOB collection is not complete!"
4,Good Throw-Back Product,"Did my outdoor patio in Retro. Product fit in well. But, if you are looking for an ashtray that will stand up to everday use then this product is not for you. Does have a cheaply made tin top that will not hold up."
4,Finally!!!,I'm not one for romance novels but this one has so much history. Can't put it down! I've read it many times and I was so excited to finally get it on kindle. There are a few typos I've noticed but otherwise it's fine. I recommend this book for anyone who wants a good historical fiction surrounded by a great love story.
4,My review,Red meets Misty and catches Red her Gyarados.They also go through Mt.moon.After they go through Mt.moon they end up in Cerulean City.Red stays at Misty's place.After a while they start to train together.Soon Red had to go and he did.
3,Don;t Buy it,"DON""T BUY IT SAVE YOUR MONEY THSI WOMEN IS AWFUL AND SINGS LIKE A CAT BEING BELTED WITH A STICK"
4,stress & mental health,"Even though OVERCOMING EMOTIONAL CHAOS is all about stress, it is not a stressful read. This is for everyone who feels that their lives are overloaded with stress, their emotions are off the charts, & their uncontrollable reactions are damaging their relationships.Good exercises -- RebeccasReads recommends it as good stuff!"
2,Myths That Every Child Should Know,"Not having any children at home any more, I just wasn't really interested in reading this book. I have put it aside."
4,good book and great for kindle,good book and great for kindle. this is a good price and works well. it is well written for children.
5,I can't believe I only bought ONE!,"I would love to find more of these! I also have several friends that have asked me where I got mine. I got it at Walmart, they had 3 or 4 bright colors and I bought Pink. I use it everyday and have to fight my husband for it!! I really would love to get some more of these neat tables."
3,Works just fine,Bought this because my local marine dealer wanted $45.00 for a oem replacement. This one works just fine and saved me some money which is always good
4,More Questions,"Overall, the questions in this book were on the ""curiosity"" side than the ""getting to know you"" approach. Some of the ideas were excellent -- many were hypothetical situation which would never happen.This book seems like it is more designed for a sleepover with your closest friends, than it is for couples who are wanting to make sure they know each other before going forward. That's not a bad thing.I was looking for something specifically for couples and did find 1000 Questions for Couples that really fit the bill at questionsforcouples. com"
4,Book,The book had a little wear and tear but still is a awesome conversation starter. It is awesome to see how your partner will respond.
5,Great Conversation Starter,There are a lot of great questions to get into good conversations with new relationships!! Feel each other out on where you stand on certain things
5,Fabulous Product!!!,"I continue to use my Body Burner after purchasing it almost a year ago in 2007. This is a wonderful piece of equipment that has changed my body! After using the BB for two weeks after receipt, I saw great changes in my body. My legs started firming up, and I lost inches and pounds from my body! I use the rebounder almost daily. I don't use the dvd's that came with the unit, but utilize other rebounding dvd's, and most times, just jog using varying tempos and movements. My stamina and level of energy have improved trememdously, and I look forward to my workouts. I incorporate the rebounder with weight training and stretching techniques. I consider this equipment a great investment and my total being has reaped great rewards!!!"
2,not too good,the trampoline is not ideal for a routine exercise program. My kids just play on it now and I got a treadmill.
2,Flathead Tuning manual,Not very impressed. They could have done so much better. Nothing like writing a book just to pat yourself on the back.
3,Business Strategy,"I think that this book as a whole is a good book, except for the fact that the graphics were done only in orange. At a business stand point I thought it gave a good representation of the material. I thought that the material covered was covered well. Although there was times when I didn't understand what the authors were trying to say because the layout was difficult to understand. Another critizium that I have is that there was no pictures. I now that this is an upper level material but some people also learn by visualization like me and to see a representation of the material would be helpful."
5,Great Cookbook!,"This cookbook is inspiring, beautiful, gives great information, and great recipes!I'm on a very limited diet, but found a couple of dishes that would be perfect for me. My husband is a great cook, and when I showed him one of the dishes, he said ""I'll make that for you!""The list of ingredients and the excellent photographs and instructions make preparation very clear. There are also some pages of how-to information about preparation and safety and other aspects of cooking. Clear, concise, really good for any cook of any age!As the book says, cooking is a wonderful way of sharing with people. This book will inspire a lot of that!"
4,"A lot of fun, and great with kids","There are a lot of cookbooks ""for kids,"" but when you read the directions, you realize that they're really cookbooks for kids to pick food from and for the parents to make. ""Boil for 30 minutes"" is not an instruction you want to see when you're trying to keep the attention of a child through the dinner creation process.This cookbook has very little of that. I've made four or five of these recipes with my boys (six and ten) and they've been able to participate AND have genuinely enjoyed the results. Some of the recipes did have some steps only mom or dad can do, but there was always something for the boys."
4,"Poetic Sardonic lyrics, great, but too much sound clips.","Claus Larson is quite an artist. His lyrics are intelligent and pertinat to what is happening and because of how frightening and evil his voice and the truthful blatantly repulsive view of society brings out a sound that very few other bands could pull off. However, he can go overboard with the sound clips, but that's what the gast forward button is for, right?"
1,really bad,"This isn't a real song! There are maybe three lines in the whole thing and the tune is really off. The ""goodbye"" line isn't sung. The AOL voice is used instead to be gimmicky, I guess. I'd be embarrased to sing this song, it's that bad."
2,"Fantastic music, but disc won't work in many players","Yann Tiersen produces some truely amazing music. Get Good Bye Lenin, and also check out Amelie and Rue De Cascades.But, as stated by another reviewer, be aware that this disc will not work in many CD players, and especially computer CD rom drives.Apparently this is because the 'copy protection' on the disc breaks the CD standard.I would suggest buying the music on-line."
4,Wow!,"My order arrived today and I'm just listening to the soundtrack for the first time... it's absolutely gorgeous - just like the film.I was very excited to hear that there was a new Yann Tiersen disc out on the market - I have previously bought ""Tout est Calme"", ""La Rupture"", ""L'absente"", ""C'etait ici"" (his double live disc - PHENOMENAL), and of course ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie poulain"". What a master of music this guy is. To boot I've also seen him perform in Marseilles and Montreal - Yann is worth whatever the ticket price is... great concerts!To sum up - buy the disc!!! And like the OP said up above, make sure to get the one that's the right length, eh? The one with 23 tracks.A Yann Superfan,Ryan."
2,It may be difficult for you to get the correct CD!,"I've tried to order the 23-track Good Bye Lenin soundtrack twice now, but Amazon sent me the 18-track (copy-protected) version each time. It's especially frustrating because they have separate pages for each of these two versions. I order it from this page - the one that displays the plain red CD cover and the 23 tracks, but I've had no luck yet. I'll just keep ordering it until they send the right one - and when they do, I'll post that here.UPDATE: As promised, this is my long-overdue follow-up review, documenting my ultimately failed attempt to get the CD that they show in the photo. Although the CD that they'll ship you isn't exactly the one that's advertised herein (hence, only 2 stars), do consider it for the lovely music that it does, in fact, contain. Not a bad consolation prize, in all."
5,Briefcase,"This is a great Briefcase, especially for the price I was able to get if for! Since I've had it, I've found it to fill all my needs in a briefcase."
1,Piece of crap,"This film blew chunks. I'd give a detailed review, but I think I fell asleep, or I had an out of body experience. Either way I had more fun watching my cat eat a spider.Watch Law and Order SVU if you want good drama."
3,Good remake......,"Being a fan of all the Manson movies and movies about the Manson family, I rented this film and I was not let down. I think Jeremy Davies gave a very believing performance as Charles Manson. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It is much better than the movie The Manson Family. Definetly worth renting if you are a Manson movie fan. A strong 3 stars."
2,Helter Skelter 2004 is pitiful,"This was such a let down after the 1976 version which was tons better. Ronny Marshall's review is ""right on"" because I thought the same thing, the person playing Sharon didn't begin to capture a 1/10th of her beauty. The '76 version is so much more suspenseful and captures the true feeling of the time and the crime. This new one is a joke and at times made me want to laugh. What a sorry actor playing Vincent B.! He made me want to laugh everytime he spoke with that accent which Vince doesn't have. Really a huge disappointment but then remarks ususally are. The guy playing Manson was also laughable after Railsback's portrayal. Don't bother with this movie. Get the original or do without!"
4,Could be better,It's a cute game but i thinks it's a little bit hard for my son to play. He still tries though.
5,Beautiful Book,Beautiful illustrations and a heart warming book about a mom working and her child in daycare.
5,Transformational information!,Dr. Laura Berman Can Help! - Intimacy Rx: Improving your Sex LifeTransformational information!
3,Nice Packaging of Recycled Material,"For horror fans who have to have all issues for their collections, this one will pass as a ""good"" one to have, but it ain't great. Regular FMOF subscribers already have seen most, if not all, of what's between the pages. I could live without it."
5,So Liltingly Musical,"First, the thought of yet another version of the Well Tempered Clavier in my collection seemed not merely unnecessary, but truly pointless. But how wrong I was, and how delighted I am with this magnificent performance and production. It is clear, crisp, and unslurred by the artificial colorings of the pedal. The musicality of it comes through definitively and liltingly. It stands head and shoulders above the other recordings I have. I will never come to the point, as Andras Schiff has, of being able to play this set of four CDs from memory(!), but I will definitely be listening to it far more than the others I have. A lifetime of practicing has paid off stunningly for Andras Schiff. This is a real accomplishment, and makes this precious achievement of Bach's all the more eternal. His feet may be flat on the floor, but his fingers are dancing."
5,GREAT MUSIC FOR EVERYONE !!!!,"In this cd it contains GREATNESS!!! TRUST ME THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!If it's to be uplifted by the inspirtational ""Optimistic"" to the great smoothness of ""Everything is going to be alright"" , As Ann Nesby and Sounds Of Blackness take it home with ""I'm going all the way"". The most perfect song on this album is during Christmas time when you have family and they come to celebrate the great ""Soul Holidays"" that makes you want to have Christmas in the middle of the year it just dosn't get any better then that!BrandonLove the album!"
1,A masterpiece of sh*t.,The film looks like a teenager grabbed a hand held and got permission to shoot in the Sams Club warehouse in his home town. I bet the horrible actors were paid with Red Lobster gift cards and all the Keystone Light they could drink on set.I just couldn't take more than 20 minutes of this train wreck. I just had to turn the thing off. This film isn't even worthy of a Mystery Science Theatere 3000 appearence. I'd honestly rather watch a Chuck Norris Total Gym infomercial. At least I'd get to look at Christy Brinkley's tight As$ in spandex.
4,Nice and light,"This windshirt is like a light jacket. I havent gotten it wet so I dont know how it holds up there, but for light winds and cold breezes it held up fine. I'm not an aggresive hiker so it did fine for me. The construction was good and the materials and nice and light."
2,Not his best,This is not the best work by this artist. Some of it is dis-jointed and other tracks are great. Little more work required by the artist.
2,"Careless Love - Madelein Peyroux - did not ""take off""!","Whilst I loved her voice, yes definitely shades of Billie Holiday,the compilation of material and arrangements were to my mind quite repetetive and boring. She is obviously surrounded by some good jazzmen, some of who I kept waiting to be allowed to contribute their undoubted talents in improvisation. Unfortunately, they were reigned in far too tight and for me the music never really lifted or ""took off"". I don't know if MP only sings ballads but it is a pity that she did not up the tempo a bit now and again. The arrangement for ""Careless Love"" in particular did not work for me, whilst interesting for perhaps the first refrain, to maintain the strict thumping tempo throughout was a mistake. Again, things failed to ""take off"""
4,best album you've never heard of,"It's true that Madeleine Peyroux sounds a lot like Billie Holiday in both her voice and her phrasing but that's okay. Both Harry Connick and Bobby Darin made good careers from reminding people of a young Sinatra. Peyroux or someone chose a wonderful collection of songs all which fit the album's theme pefectly. She has a beautiful, smokey bourbon on the rocks voice, like Lady Day and she's using it to marvelous effect here. Nevermind what you saw at the Grammy's. This was the best album to come out of 2004."
3,Well-produced Labor of Love,"Impressive A & R with soft, light instrumentation to make the listening experience perfect for a restfull afternoon. Grab a green tea or two and a lemon cookie.Her alllegiance to the ""Queens"" of Jazz/Blues/Folk has been duly documented above. My favorite tracks are ""Lonesome Road"", one of the best renditions I've ever heard and ""Don't Cry Baby"", though I was hoping for something like James Brown's sonic exercise on said opus. She really needed to open up and go Soulful on at least one - there is a samey quality to every single cut."
4,Fondness for Careless Love,If you've ever wished that Billie Holiday were still alive and singing. Check out Madeleine Peyroux. One of the best thing out of of Georgia in a long time.
4,Fu Manchu has a skinny lil bro...chillin',"What's up with the goon who reviewed this cd twice, giving it two different ratings? This album is pretty cool-a rockin' good time, just enough bite and crunch to keep me groovin'...mellow man."
1,Nikon 995 [stinks],Spent nearly [item price] when all was said and done. The camera is fun. The software [is bad] and renders the camera of little value. Nikon supports [is] worse than their software. Virtually impossible to get any of my computers to recognize the memory cards so I can transfer the images to my hard drive. I have spent hours and hours and hours trying to get this worked out. Buy something else!!! I seriously regret this purchase.
4,A wonderful camera at $[money],I paid only $[money] after rebate for my camera. I am thoroughly pleased with it. I have made hundreds of pictures and have had great results. It does have a complicated menu but that is due to it's extensive feature set. I have been buying 128MB Compactflash cards for about $[money] at a local electronics supplier and they have been completely satisfactory.The only annoyance with the camera is the size and weight of the wide angle adapter and the fact that the flash and viewfinder cannot be used when it is installed. I will have to buy a flash bracket and an external flash to be able to use a flash with the wide angle adapter.
5,Exactly what I wanted,This memory card has worked perfectly. It was exactly what I needed (to be able to play PSone games on PS2). Fast shipping too!
3,ps1 memory card,Well there were some info that was wrong the memory card was not gray like the pic that was displayed. It came in blue but that's ok cause that my color of choice over all it works and it saved the games i was playing so no its not defeacted in any way.
3,Good!!!,The product was acceptable. The peanuts were not real crunchy. The packaging was terrible so maybe that had something to do with the freshness.
1,A Specious Endeavor,"The folly of this book is that Ms. Rudacille paints it as a matter of Animal Research vs. Animal Protection, when the real dichotomy (not that animal research doesn't torture animals, because it does) is Animal Research vs. Good Science. This book presupposes that animal research helps people, which evidence shows is faulty at best. 92% of all new drugs that pass animal testing go on to fail in human clinical tests because they are too toxic or ineffective. Of the remaining 8% that pass the human tests, HALF are later withdrawn from the market because of side effects (sometimes lethal) that animal tests did not predict. That means FOUR PERCENT of drugs that pass animal tests stay on the market (and who knows how many humans they kill or maim in the process)!If you want to read a more accurate work, check out ""Sacred Cows and Golden Geese: The Human Cost of Experiments on Animals"" by Dr. C. Ray Greek and Jean Swingle Greek, DVM."
4,Good looking,The mat came fast and looks good but it is not very big. I bought this mat as a present for someone so I hope the receiver likes it.
2,Okay,"the music is okay, but the production and playing can use a little work. Get Eva o's 1999 release Damnation-ride the madness. It is so much better, darker, and moving. I can not explain how much better that album is. The style is way different, while the playing and production is much better."
5,"A Fine, Fine Film",I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Raven is a doll. Martin is Martin in a G-rated version. I like the way they interact and I am glad to see a movie with a clean-cut black family. I like the fact that there is a Mom and Dad that seem to love each other and their children. This movie can be related to by all families. It gives a person hope that there are still decent people living decent lives.
3,Come on Raven and Martin!!!,"This movie is a great concept, but I think some of it was too childish. Even though it says college road trip it is meant for younger audiences. So this movie isn't bad it has a lot of good moments and funny moments. I thought Martin Lawerence would be funnier."
5,Handy Snack On the Go,These nuts are absolutely delicious. I eat them whenever I get a little craving for something good and tasty. They always hit the spot and I have to control myself to keep from eating two bags sometimes. I am ordering them again and I am glad to have found a healthy snack that I don't have to feel guilty about enjoying.
3,Go with the book,"I remember reading Flatland as a kid and I thought it was cool to think about all the different dimensions. I was excited to see that someone undertook to film it. Granted Mr. Ehlinger did this as a one-man show and I give him a lot of credit. I liked the imagery and the colorful world he created and he captured the story well. I wish the women's ""peace cries"" weren't as annoying as the book portrayed them and there weren't as much bloodshed and the story stalled at times, but if he had a larger budget he'd have accomplished much more. So ""A"" for effort, ""C"" for delivery."
3,"Excellent Stories, but Where was the Editor?","I've never enjoyed reading negative reviews, but I felt it necessary to post a word of warning as well as a question. The real-life experiences contained in this book of stories were excellent, but the spelling, punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure were clearly and disturbingly not edited. It is possible that I received a draft or early-release copy of the book, but I wanted to know if anyone else who bought this item noticed this. Feedback anyone?"
5,Excellent resource,"This is the one-stop, must-read reference material for anyone with an interest in American politics. The book's narratives of the states, members of Congress are first-rate and can't be found anywhere else."
3,Where's the bite of yesteryear?,"I share the reservations of others here who remember the oldestversion of Almanac, written with Grant Ujifusa. The Almanac was fun, then: witty, balanced, wry, sharp. It spoke often tothe real worth--or lack of it--of the Congress members and Governors reported on. It dared to note who was a pompous charlatan and who was an unappreciated workhorse. Its criticism and encomiums seemed to me to be balanced. Now, unhappily, the reporting is bland, and radicalism of any kind isdecried--particularly on the left. Probably it sells more copies now--I know that it's much more expensive. It's worth it for the assemblage of data in a single place, but reads rather like the average telephone directory. Surely the dullards of today in Congress deserve to be as bitingly outed as the old Almanac began?"
2,Fox News In the Print Edition,"As one reads the various customer reviews, it becomes obvious that the commentary in this book is skewed sharply to the right. Conservatives think it's ""fair and balanced""; liberals don't. That's a tell tale sign as far as 24 TV news networks are concerned.I have bought every edition since I turned 18 in 1978, but have decided not to purchase the next release after the 2006 election cycle. The hard factual information is accurate and well-presented. But the partisan slant compromises the book's credibility as an analytical product. With so much tendentious material, how can anyone not desirous of receiving the Fox News party line have confidence in the soundness of the commentary--the ""soft"" factual information? Michael Barone made an excellent and original contribution to political research when he introduced the Almanac back in the '70's. He now generates a product that's ""in your face"" if you're moderate or liberal. If you like George Bush, you'll love this book."
2,Browining sugarcoats life in a mill village,"If you title your book ""Linthead""--a truly ugly term--you suggest that you will have something to say about the stereotypes that thousands of textile workers have had to endure over the decades. But Browning's life seems to have been nothing but ball games and front porches, a sunny slice of Americana that could have happened anywhere (especially on tv--this is smalltown America as black and white tv imagined it). Browining just doesn't seem to get it: for people who were not talented ballplayers or who otherwise lacked the skills he was fortunate to have, life on a mill hill was not edenic."
1,Doesn't support WindowsME,"I just received the Microsoft Internet Keyboard PRO today as a gift. After connecting it and trying to run the install program I received the message that the software is incompatible with this version of Windows (I have Windows ME). The message gives a link to Microsoft for a download, but the link does not work. As I type this the spacebar is sticking. When I tried to download new software the time required will be over two hours. (This is with a cable modem.) The technical data for this item says it is compatible with Windows ME, but does not say a download is required."
5,Just like MS to make a great prod. and then yank it ...,"... from the shelf. This keyboard is now out of circulation. MS decided to discontinue making them, why I dunno. It is great if you have a laptop but like to use a regular Keyboard when space allows. With it's 2 USB ports on the back, you can plug into the USB on your laptop (I only have 1)and still have not 1 but two USB slots available (one for optical mouse and one for digital camera in my case). Great idea, at least I thought... guess MS didn't like the idea of a happy customer."
1,"""November Dream"" is the only reason to own this..","Usherhouse simply failed here.. As the title says, the only possible reason to own this CD is the song ""November Dream"" - In my opinion the best song they ever released and it's utterly amazing, if only anything else on this release were 1/10th as good. I can almost justify an extra star for that song but I decided against it =PIf your going to get an Usherhouse CD get their first release ""Molting"" its much better, but even at that - ""November Dream"" is their only stake to salvation as far as I'm concened.This CD is selling used for 43 CENTS used at the time I'm writing this and thats 42 cents too much if you already have the compilation disc ""Gothik"" (has ""November Dream"" on it, mislabeled as ""November Rain"")."
4,Bear Blaster,"I give this Air Horn 4 stars because I haven't had a chance to put it to use for the purpose intended, but it IS loud. The only criticism I could have in the future is for the plastic ring which is used to attatch the horn to the air bottle. The ring is thin and under some tension. Once attached, my concern is that it could snap and allow the horn to fall off. If that happens, the ring cannot be repaired and the horn will become useless.--Just speculating!"
5,CHRISTMAS GIFT,"I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. It was very high on his wish list. And he loves it!! (Sorry, mom.)"
1,Worse Music DVD Ever Bought,I bought this DVD based upon other's 5 star reviews. I cannot figure out if they got a better DVD copy than mine which has terrible video quality almost like someone made this DVD from their cell phone. The audio is by no means in any audio format than a poor stereo recording. I was hoping for Dolby 5.1 and could never get this to play in other than stereo. I then looked at returning this DVD and found out that i would loose half my money so i just decided that i would leave this as my lessons learned loss. Do not buy this DVD!
4,Enjoyable,"I purchased this as a gift for my 75 year old father and though I wish the videos were more current than 1975, he really enjoyed it and that's all that matters,"
1,review,"Its over-sized kiss lock hard ware is perfectly cute. However, its opening is extremely narrow and flat so it is uncomfortable and ugly. The material is not leather but cheap vinyl or PVC."
2,Oops!,"I read the reviews on this product AFTER I purchased the product as a gift for my nephew. My sister was too polite to complain, but this product is a pricey plastic piece of junk! Too ridgid to provide opportunities for improved gross motor development. I'm very disappointed. Should have gone with the Peg Perego version of this product."
5,Best Book By Far....,"I've read the MSPress Certification book, BOL (SQL server Books Online), and neither come close to the under standing this book gives. Things I've read 5 times over in the other aforemenioned book and still didn't get an understanding, I read once in this book and understood right off.I wished I had this book before taking the admin exam (I passed, but caught heck doing it).aaron@aaronford.com"
4,Great book,This book covers the client side of Sql Server application development extremely well. It covers nearly all the client side technolgies and provides real-world examples for putting them to work. Rob is a good teacher and I've put many of his recommendations into practice. Get a good T-Sql book to go with it and you have all you need to build sophisticated Sql Server applications.
4,A somewhat dissappointing show from a great band,"I love The Jeff Healey Band. I have for quite some time now. Something was missing from this show, however. I can't quite pinpoint it. Mr. Healey did mention that the band was jet lagged. Perhaps that was it. They just did not have the sparkle or energy that they normally have. Even a disappointing show from them is still really good, though. It is a worthwhile purchase, even if it is not their best effort."
3,A hard read.,"I have read several books by this author/teacher/designer. I have to say that although he has written some usefull books, such as Printing in a Digital world, (which is now a bit out of date, but much of the same information is covered in his other, newer books), Publishing with In-Design suffers from a too narrow point of view. It is a textbook, and should not be considered a ""Quickee reference book"" on In-Design. It is not the best example of writing either. It is dense, not particularly well organized, and suffers also from a sort of train-of-thought writing style that reads as if he wrote it one page at a time, front to back, and didn't look back. It also has many typos, and I don't find the author's personal viewpoint on certain matters to be interesting or well conveyed."
5,Great little tool.,"I bought the Averatec 2200 and am really happy with it. I have not found a single thing that I haven't been able to do with it. It actually moves much faster than my desktop, which has more memory. The great thing about the Averatec 2200 series is that it is small and lightweight and it has almost every kind of basic device and input you would need. Of course, I am not running more than one or two programs at a time mostly and I am not running a huge amount of graphics. Mainly I use my laptop for word processing, internet and e-mail. I also occasionally play computer games (the graphics are as good as anything its size and not too slow) and mess around with photographs and DVD's. These have run well for me. I can't find anything wrong with the computer and no glitches to speak of, so I give it a perfect score - especially because of the price and features."
5,I like the Vitamin Shoppe products,"It's hard for me to know if these vitamins are as potent as claimed, since I'm not a medicinal chemist. However, the Teavigo capsules I've purchased from the Vitamin Shoppe (don't forget the 'e' at the end!) are good quality, so I assume the best.The price is right on these vitamin B3 tablets. The niacinamide delivers the goods without the annoying flushing of straight niacin, the other major form of B3. I've read a study that shows, in healthy volunteers, niacinamide boosts the immune system by increasing the numbers of neutrophils. I've also just read that niacinamide may help reduce the brain's natural decline as it ages. Hey, that sounds great! So I'll give it a try and see.This manufacturer has a good reputation and now has retail stores in many states. Recommended."
1,Not worth it,"We bought this camera for my 5 years old daughter as a gift, she was so excited and she took a lot of pictures, when we arrived home, I've tried to upload the pictures to my Windows 7 and couldn't, even with another PC, it simply didn't work.it was total waste of money and I'm totally NOT recommending this to anyone."
1,kt7002 Drivers,The drivers only work on Windows xp. I tested it on Vista and Windows 7 and it doesnt work. If you manage to get the drivers to work you will realize what a crappy camera it truely is. It has a flash but good luck using it unless you have a doctorate in electrical engineering. You dont need the headache!!! Picture quality is also bad.
1,downloadable?!,"If you can get the pictures to download before the batteries die, you might have fun with the camera.I haven't been able to download the images in any format."
1,Shakespeare's worst play & Anthony Hopkins' worst film,"The critics said that Titus is the worst play of Shakespeare, although I may not fully agree... but difinitly this movie is the worst of Anthony Hopkins.The movie should have not been placed in the current century, this has killed the movie and made it senseless!I loved the music of this film, loved the settings and acting but all together with Shakespeare language did not make any sense."
1,"Too far gone to even be considered an ""interpretation.""","After viewing this movie, it was more than plain to me that directress Taymor had bit off more than she could possibly chew. The idea of Taymor making her debut in movies by directing Shakespeare is preposterous in itself, and as soon as you see the first time she inserts ridiculous ""visions"" of limbs being burnt and men wearing deer heads, you'll realize that this ""Lion King"" directress has absolutely no place touching works by the great Bard. In addition, the ""grand finale"" of the movie consists of 3 entire minutes of NOTHING but a boy walking out of a theatre in slow motion. Such monstrosity and ""post-modernism"" may have a place on MTV, but they do not in the eloquent world of Shakespeare. Before she is allowed to touch another script, Taymor needs to learn the difference."
1,Rent before you buy,"My wife and I rented this video anticipating a nice evening watching two of our favorite actors perform together. Our bewilderment started when the movie started off with a modern day kid playing with gladiator dolls at the kitchen table and absolutely trashing the place. It was messier than the food fight in Animal House. We became perplexed when shortly thereafter was a scene of gladiators marching, amongst which were carts being pulled by motorcycles. I guess some folks have better drugs than others. It didn't take us too long to get our fill of this bizarre movie. We were so glad we didn't waste more than a DVD rental fee and either see this in the theater or buy it. So if you're considering purchasing this film, rent it before you buy it."
5,great movie,I saw this movie in theaters and I was very impressed with it. The acting was great and the costumes and sets were very well done. See this movie!
5,Bloody Good!,"Shakespeare's ""Titus Andronicus"" is a bitter, bloody example of blind hubris and the strenght of family ties. Set in a post-modern Rome, ""Titus"" is blood, conspiracy, and murder. Unlike most Shakespearian plays, this one is full of blood, not just assumed violence.Anthony Hopkins plays a very believeable Titus, who has arrived from battle to see a Rome devided by his own son, Bassicus, competing with Saturnicus for the crown. Titus, respecting nothing but honor, suggest that his son's opposition take the helm of Rome. This begins a tragic ride into the abyss for Titus and his family. They are then subjected to unspeakable tyranny while the Saturnicus is being seduced by the evil Tamora, played by the beautiful Jessica Lange.This movie is not for the under 18 crowd. Brace yourself, this is not the Shakespeare you know..."
1,"Blood, guts, and good acting",This film is artistically well-done. The acting is top notch. It is also one of the most disgustingly violent films I have ever seen. It is so gory and disturbing that I couldn't get through the entire film. Only for viewers with REALLY strong stomachs.
5,A wild and literally timeless masterpiece,"This movie throws one from all accepted standards of film out into an oblivion where anything can and does happen without reason or explanation. The acting is excellent as are all of the techinical aspects. If you enjoy Shakespeare and confusion brought together in heart-wrenching beauty, buy this film."
1,Poorly Written,I am the CEO of a midsized company and I don't know how this man is able to publish. He butchers the English language and is terrible at articulating his ideas. This is a TERRIBlE read.
1,Can I give negative stars please???,"The previous posters did a good job of describing everything that is wrong with this movie. If I hadn't paid for it, I would have never watched it. I would prefer staring at a blank TV screen."
2,Yawn,"We played this in the car, modifying the rules a little to make it possible to play without writing things down. Some of the sounds are truly challenging while others are simply impossible or too specific. It becomes more of a chore than fun after about 10 minutes of play. Also the ""announcers"" repeat themselves often and it becomes annoying."
5,Funny and Creepy!,"Unexplained, Unexpected is awesome! The characters are quirky and relatable, they are so funny. A paranoid man named Dr. Doubt, a Star Trek fanatic, and a woman with a hidden past make up just part of the team in this amazingly funny and creepy story. A must read!"
4,Absolutely haunting...,"It isn't often that I stumble upon an album every track of which I enjoy, but ""Terra Regina"" is just that. A spectacular melding of the guitar-driven variety of gothic rock and the swirling dreaminess of the ethereal genre, there's something on this album to appeal to anyone who fancies either style.There are a number of strong tracks on this CD (""Protecteur"" being my personal favorite) and nearly every song included here is mournful yet danceable. Even ""Epilogue"", the vocals of which are spoken rather than actually sung, is a powerful piece, without the pretentious quality so common to spoken-word works."
1,WARNING - DANGER D70 Owners!!!!!!!,If you bought or own a D70 DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! IT IS **>NOT<** COMPATIBLE!!!!!Stick with the recomended SB-600 or SB-800. I bought one without the camera shop sales clerk correctly pointing out that I was simply wasting my money. Now its an expensive paperweight.
4,Good improvement from last edition,This is the book that I used to teach comparative vertebrate anatomy. The previous major flaw of the book was the many inaccuracies in the figures. However many of these appear to be changed. All in all this book is a good book to reference to for a variety of questions about vertebrates. Not the easiest of books to wade through for a beginner but Kardong for the most part does a good job in explanations and descriptions for a book of this level
5,Gems from the King,"This is one of the best CDs released by Follow That Dream Records. It features outtakes from Elvis' American Studios recording sessions in 1969. These recordings are acknowledged as being among Elvis' best. This CD features alternate versions of Elvis classics like ""Stranger In My Own Home Town"", ""In the Ghetto"", ""Suspicious Minds"", ""Long Black Limousine"" and ""Kentucky Rain"". It's fascinating to hear early versions of these songs, without the horn, string and girl group overdubs the finished versions have. Recommended for all Elvis fans."
3,More questions than answers,"I enjoy reading topics about education during the summer months, and this book had some really good questions. However, I felt like I walked away with more questions than answers. I would like to see a book with more ideas about the solutions rather than the problem. It would have been o.k. to check out from the library, but buying it wasn't worth it."
2,A Bit Shallow,"Though it does provide the steps to publishing children's books, it does so with as little depth as possible leaving the reader with a multitude of unanswered questions."
4,Son Volt rules,I'm a new fan of Son Volt and I really enjoyed this DVD. Jay Farrar is a very talented songwriter and he surrounds himself with good players. Highly recommended!
5,Excellent show!,"I miss these days! I like Jay's current stuff but Boquist was a heck of a musician. He demonstrates his diverse abilities on this set with rockin guitar, banjo, electric slide, and a fiddle. Is there anything with strings he can't play? Jay looks like such a youngster but already commanded a presence with his unique voice and complex lyricism. I figured out how he plays 'Out of the Picture' by watching the DVD. If you like Son Volt or Uncle Tupelo, this one will make you smile over and over."
4,"Son Volt ""Live From Austin, Texas"" = A Very Good Alternative Country Concert DVD!!!!","The lead man for Son Volt is Jay Farrar. He originally was in a band called ""Uncle Tupelo"" with Jeff Tweedy of ""Wilco"". This is a very good concert, with a running time of approximately 68 minutes. Jay Farrar wrote every song in this DVD. This concert was filmed on November 11, 1996.The line-up:Jay Farrar - lead vocals, and guitarDave Boquist - guitar, violin, banjo, lap steelJim Boquist - bass, backing vocalsMike Heidorn - drumsThe songs set:1.Route2.Loose String3.Cemetery Saviour4.Catching ON5.Live Free6.Tear Stained Eye7.True to Life8.Left a Slide9.Windfall10.Out of the Picture11.Back into Your World12.Ten Second News13.Picking up the Signal14.Drown15.Too Early16.ChickamaugaOverall, this is a good entertaining, solid 4 star concert DVD. So, if you like alternative country, then you should enjoy this one. Thanks!!!"
1,What a Disappointment,"Having religiously read (and loved) Elizabeth Lowell, I was ecstatic to see this previously released novel reprinted. However, the novel does not live up to my expectations. Clearly, Elizabeth Lowell's novels have gotten better over the years (thank goodness). But as a consumate Lowell fan, this really does not compare to some of her more recent attempts."
3,"great product, leaky capsules","I have bought Solaray for several years, exclusively. Recently I have found the same problem as 2 other reviewers - leaky, broken capsules. Not only is it a waste, but it makes it nasty because all of the unbroken capsules are coated in Calcium powder. I hope they fix this."
2,RODENTS ON THE RUN,"This is a dubbed German made for TV movie that isn't all that bad, nor all that good. The scenes with the thousands of rats is pretty effective. The dubbing is pretty bad and hinders the actors (?) performances. The story revolves around a rat infestation in Frankfort, where the bitchy mayor lowered funding for waste removal thereby causing a strike, in which the garbage isn't picked up; it's also the hottest summer in Frankfort history so this situation inflames the rodent's appetite and ferocity.Not a complete time waster for fans of this kind of movie."
5,Great Products and Service,"Our very particular Jack Russel clearly prefers these natural products over all others, including other natural brands. We are very comfortable feeding them to her. The Doggie De Lites owners were very responsive in directing us to the great deals at Amazon on their products."
5,Just what I needed,"I'm writing as someone new to Final Cut Express (and a veteran of 4 iMovie blockbusters.) After spending some frustrating time with printed out chapters from the long but not very helpful Apple supplied online manual, the light finally shone when Tom Wolsky's book arrived.He writes well and organized the rather complicated material clearly and patiently. The included DVD is a great complement to the text, providing material for practice in each chapter. It felt as though I was working alongside Mr. Wolsky. The DVD also contains helpful examples of transitions and effects.I'm still a beginner but I have completed 2 modest videos and a third is in the works. Final Cut Express Editing Workshop is just what I needed to get started with this fascinating software."
2,Not happy with this,"It is not at all clear from the description what this book actually is. It is only an index of names which appear in the book, nothing more!"
2,Not what I exspected,"Not really the best book about WW1 in Flanders. Sometimes boring. Too much information about locations (too specific for a non-flemish) and regiments and batallions. The author should have focused more on tactical warfare and possible different strategies and their implications. This is just a too detailed chronological report of the facts, nothing more. The few comments he published from soldiers that survived the battles are too short and do not fit in the structure of his book. The author should have worked out this book much better. I was disappointed!"
4,The Very Early Cliff - British King of Rock Music!!!,"This is the very first Cliff Richard album, my mother bought for me whilst I was 10. I was rather distracted by the screeching and wailing of the teenage girls, when I initially listened to the LP on my turntable. But after a few listens, Cliff's singing and the Shadows'(known as the ""Drifters"" at the time)energizing backings started to show its 'pounding' power!!!I particularly like Be-Bop-a-Lula, Donna, Move It(Cliff's classic), That'll be the Day, and of course, the two Shadows' instrumental greats,viz. 'Jet.Black'and 'Driftin'',demonstrating the individual craftsmanship of the four superb musicians.To this day, I still enjoy the album tremendously. Remember, this is the very early Cliff, and the teenage flavour of the late Fifties, was very strong!!! Give it a good listen.....I'm sure you'll like its raw recordings."
5,Failing Your Way to Success,"Did you hear the one about the travelling salesman...? You will when you read, ""The Death of 20th Century Selling,"" a quick read that really hits home! In fact, you'll find out all the blunders the travelling sales rep made, so you won't fall into the same traps.All those embarrassing moments when we lose the sale stay around to haunt us, but Dan shows us the value in using those sales blunders to develop better selling techniques. This highly entertaining book is packed with wit and wisdom. You can't help but learn from other people's mistakes, which is a whole lot better than learning from your own! I highly recommend this book for anyone in sales, and after all, aren't we all selling something?If you want to laugh and learn at the same time, add this book to your library of sales books. Highly recommended!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I did and at first i was really looking forward to getting it since i ordered it off amazon. i listened to the sample and i thought to myself yeah thats pretty good. but when i recieved it in the mail i put it in my stereo and listened to three or four songs and had to turn it off due to the fact it sounds like every new metal band now a day and had no originality and it wasn't that great. i am a die hard black metal fan. I am all for church burnings and pentagrams everywhere and now i'm getting into the viking style of black metal. I'd reccomend buying Cradle of Filth's Thornography before this and i hate Thornography with every fiber of my being. Stick with Emperor, Immortal, Mayhem, old Dimmu Borgir, Bathory, Graveworm, Kampfar, Naglfar and Leviathan if you are into real black metal!"
5,Excellent Reading Experience!,"This was truly a book I could not put down! I was rapt with attention on every page. I could have read another 500 pages about this family. Dani Shapiro has a gift for making you feel like you are listening to a friend tell her story to you. I was rooting for all of the characters and really cared about them. This is definitely one of the best books I have read. Do not hesitate to purchase this book, just make sure you have an open schedule when you start reading it, you will not want to stop!"
2,Boring,Kept waiting for something to happen. Something to pull me in. Sorry but I couldn't relate to this New york art couple living this life that is to far from any reality I know. The 2nd child born 12 years later. That is strange to me and then the what crazy teen daughter was she mental or spoiled the book won't tell you. Who are these people and what kind of fictional family is this?
1,I couldn't finish the book,I couldn't get past the 3rd chapter with this book...All Rachel Jensen talked about was how her life sucked and how she couldn't get through....This book really was not good
2,but no history offered...,"I was disappointed with this book, as it seemed to start to lead somewhere, and then wander off. I first thought the abrupt change in the daughter's behaviour, that leads to her being mentally ill was just not quite right in the description. She was perfect one moment, the child from hell the next. She returns from camp with a navel piercing: no professional would do that for a 14 year old and it is practically impossible to do yourself. Then there was the accident, it seemed almost as if Kate was going to admit she was on drugs or drinking when it happened,but she never did. It seemed a little too trite considering the heavy tone of the writing in the aftermath. However, the description of the borderline personality mother was perfection in itself: how they ruin the lives of others. That alone was worth the read. Rest of it was just below average. Also, as it was called Family History, it never linked the mental illness to the family, in my estimation."
4,Very good experience so far.,"I received this DLP TV a few months ago and have had plenty of time to experience it. I haven't had any serious problems, the shipping process was painless- the shippers called me to schedule a delivery time making it easy to work with my schedule, and the quality of the TV has been outstanding. It's a huge projection TV and the HD channels come in as good as they possibly can. Hooked up to my XBOX 360, the quality is amazing. I had no troubles taking advantage of the full 1080p. Finally, hooking up my laptop to the TV was easy to do and gave amazing quality as well.The only downside that I experienced, which I'm not sure where the problem lies, but I have COX cable in my area, and while using their On Demand feature, I noticed the TV will turn itself off automatically after some time goes by. Almost as if it is detecting idle time and shutting down. But only seems to happen with the On Demand feature. Not really a show stopper."
4,Great TV!,"I bought this TV for my home theater, essentially for watching movies from DVDs. I also bought an upconverting DVD player and I am very satisfied with the quality of the image.This TV is capable of receiving off-air digital television (DTV), both for standard and hig definition TV. The HDTV reception is very good. Be sure you use the best possible connection from your video sources to this TV for the best possible picture.The only thing that bothers me (so far...) is the fact that whenever you try to reprogram the channels (if you adjust the antenna, for example), the previously programmed channels are deleted and replaced.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, but I think that the prices of DLP TVs should come downs pretty soon."
2,Lemon,"IF you can get this massive tv for a good price that's great but just know that you will have to pour money into it just like a lemon car for the duration of owning it. The bulbs burn out, it gets white dots all over and costs 200.00 dollars to repair. We have had to replace other pieces as well. Also it has started just turning itself off, and dont you DARE try to turn in back on right away because you will freak it out and break it again!!!"
5,Code of Bushido,"For those who like a more ""realistic"" depiction of Japanese martial arts, ""The Hunted"" is a MUST SEE. The only thing that seperates the Samurai from the Ninja IS the code of honor ""BUSHIDO"". The Hunted pits these two age old martial disciplines against each other in a very exciting and realistic way. The sword ""fight"" scenes are incredible at the same time believeable. A MUST SEE for anyone who enjoys, and appreciates, ""BUDO""."
5,The Hunted,"DVD and case good to excellent, service fast, return information provided. Thats all I need."
3,Too bare,"What content is in this book is decent. The problem is that there just isn't much of it, and it doesn't go into much depth. It might be good as a basic introduction, but one should look into more substantial volumes if they really want to know about armored warfare."
3,bleh,This is what feminists and civil rights activists have been arguing for over a century... just re-phrased by an upper-class white male - how typical!
4,": looks for sense of humor, puts it back in place","Did those of you who, at any point, thought these were real, rather than excellent works resulting from dynamic inspiration, check your senses of humor at the bookstore door, or did you never have them in the first place? You *cannot* take these kinds of things seriously, per se - you just have to enjoy them for what they are - brief ""missing scenes"" which were written in *homage* to Jane Austen's stories, and which *do* fit well into the works themselves in terms of characterization, manner and writing style, but *obviously*, *clearly* and *blatently* are 21st century writings!"
4,Bushnell Night Watch For the hard to buy for guy!,"Got this for a gift for my grandson, he loved it, good gift for a hard to buy for guy!"
3,Not for serious nite watchers.,This was my first experience with nightvision monoculars. Doesn't pick up images very well therefore use is limited. Perhasps I expected too much.
3,Bushnell night monocular,Size and weight are nice for carrying - works very well and was surprised at the distance you can still make out an image. EZ to use.
2,"Bushnell night watch 2x24, w/built on infrared monocular","When I bought this item, I thought you could really zoom in and see far away. But that is not the case. It does not go as far as, I would like it to go. We have a snake in a tree and a racoon, and I THOUGHT IF I BOUGHT THIS ITEM I COULD SEE DEEP IN THE TREE, TO SEE WHICH ONE WILL WHEN THE FIGHT OVER THE OTHER. It is very clear from side to side, but, does not go very far long distance.I do not reccommend this item, it is not what I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, FOR NIGHT VISION, INFRARED MONOCULAR. I ONLY GIVE THIS ITEM TWO STARS.Jim in Ohio"
3,Could be more comfortable,"I'm using this for a 13"" aluminum MacBook.This is a great product--sturdy & lightweight, with high quality manufacturing. It seems to do a great job dissipating heat. It also fits perfectly in my laptop back without adding too much bulk.The lip at the bottom is the perfect height for the new MacBook. Before getting this stand, the sharp bottom edge of the laptop used to hurt my wrists, but this has solved that problem.The only problem is that it becomes uncomfortable on my lap after a while. Eventually, the laptop becomes heavy and the hard edge presses into my legs."
3,disappointed,"It is a good program if you would like to know about Nostradamus but it wasn't what I expected. I had expected more detail about his prophecies but they were not dwelt on as much as his life was. That was okay. Alot of info I did not know about him. Again, Not what I expected but still a biography movie."
2,not exactly what I had hoped for,"I was kind of excited to find a book written by archeologists. I love historical fiction, and I am interested in the early Amerinds. Actually, there is a lot of good attention to detail in this book. Names of plants, ways of life: it all seemed very real. I found myself perusing an atlas: where exactly are these ""sideways mountains""?However, there were some aspects of this book that really turned me off. Okay, I get it that Amerinds engaged in sexual relations. But it seemed a bit overdone. You know, the I-can't-give-this-to-my-teen feeling.What was worse was all the mysticism and spiritual stuff. Again, I understand why it was included. But it was incredibly overdone, consuming many pages. I finally had to stop reading. The theology of these people (as imagined) was so illogical as to be painful, and it threw a wrench into what was otherwise good writing.Think of ""Dune"" only set in Montana. Actually the Dune universe made more sense."
4,Supported by Scripture,"Mr. Van Kampen does very well supporting his answer of when the Rapture will occur with scripture. He does not use assumptions or ""wouldn't it be nice"" opinions of the pretribulation rapture supporters. I strongly urge those who fall into this category to read this book. I originally believed in the pretrib rapture, but when I actually studied it on my own, there was more evidence against it, then for it. Then I read Mr. Van Kampen's book. He backed what I had come to believe, and supported it with very strong scripture evidence. Good read. Flows nicely."
5,Compatibility,You stated in your description of this product that it is compatible with ALL Nikon digital SLRs. This is only partially true. The autofocus feature DOES NOT work on Camera bodies such as the Nikon D5000 which do not have an internal autofocus motor. I feel that I was misrepresented on this item. I kept the lens because it was a little cheaper and I've owned camera's that I had to focus manually but I'm not altogether happy with it.You need to let people know that this lens is not 100% compatible.
2,Verizon FIOS TV,"Little disappointed, I have Verizon FIOS I installed this in my media box ened up recieve a very porr signal on all my TV's ended up having to go back to my old 4 to 4 2GHZ radio shack splitters. Which doesn't look very pretty in my media box. I tired everything I could to get this to work even went out and got the primer RG6 connectors and recut the wires and still was getting a poor signal."
4,go to run,"Fast, sharp, but you got to move your feet if you want a good pictures. Work great indoor. Has not try much outdoor. A little noisy with the focusing. Overall, a great value and fun to use lens. You can get sharp images without flashes indoor at f2.8. Also can get great bokeh."
3,Make sure you have the right camera,"The information on the website says this is for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras, but it apparently is not for all such cameras. My son has a Nikon D5000, which has autofocus and is a digital SLR camera, but the autofocus on this lens does not work with his camera. I had to return it (a Christmas present) and order a different lens. I'm sure it's a fine lens, just don't get it for a D5000. I don't know what other cameras the autofocus might not work with. (The manual focus works fine, of course.)"
4,Good Lense and delivers nice depth to pictures.,"This is a good lense , I like the output.Only difficulty is you need to move back and forth while taking picture as its only 50mm but I'm use to it."
5,Great Lens!,Perfect lens for camera. Can take really great photos with it. Thought I had already reviewed this item. It is perfect. Thank you.
5,Worth every cent!!,Indeed it is a very bright very fast lense. Great for portraits. Just two weeks and I am loving it already for what all can it do. Its very sharp. Aperture ring is a bit stiff though and has the plastic feel to it as others have pointed out too. But thats no biggie... Go for it guys... for 100 bucks its a deal always.
3,Dissapointed...,"I was so excited to order this based on other comments, but I found the name and packaging milseading, It's called AF, but its not AF on any digital camera in the enthusist range. I find the lens difficult to focus and only so-so for low light."
2,Nikon 50mm,Nice lense but it does not work with a Nikon D5000. It had all the features that I was looking for but no cigar. When I put it on the body it told me that there was no lense attached.
3,Dissappointed,"I was looking for a lenses that could get great bokeh in portraiture without breaking the bank, and the 50mm f/1.8D looked like an excellent option. Well, I slapped down the money, got the lenses, and was--well--disappointed. I should have read more reviews first, but I didn't. The bokeh is extremely polygonal as apposed to circular. When shooting wide open the pictures are very granular. Auto focus does not work with D3100's, but I am okay with manually focusing. Also, the focusing ring and whole lense feels flimsy.All in all, you get what you pay for; the lense still functions, so it isn't a complete write off."
3,Great value for the price,"This lens is definitely a great value. Some distortion in my exposures, and the auto adjust is quite loud! All in all though, it's a nice inexpensive lens to add to your collection. I found this is best used as a portrait lens in low lighting."
4,After several months of use: excellent -superb !!!,"Hi: this is a really good lens, I got sharp pictures of waterfalls that looked very nice. The depth of field you can attain is significant, and you can create many artistic effects with this feature. In my Nikon D90 works fine, with autofocus. At 50mm in D90 it is actually 75mm, so not wide angle, and you need forward and backward yourself to frame your subject. It is fast and light, incredible light ! It needs a photographer backside, of course :-) !Update December 2009: After several months I can say the lens is superb in quality, especially for portraits, it is sharp, fast, indoors and outdoors, excellent."
5,Can't beat it for the price!,After a ton of research I finally opted for the f1.8 50m and I'm so glad I did. For the price there really is no better lens you can own.
5,So nice,"This lens is a true great buy. The dof is amazing and everything in focus is so crisp. I was shooting (using the kit lens) the other day, and I ended up pulling out this lens because the Lighting was so bad in the gym. My shutter went from 1/60 to 1/150! This lens is also great for portraits and I even use it for mountain biking. It is super light, and a really great extra tool to have. Plus, how can you go wrong at only $130?"
4,Must-have standard lens for cash-strapped photographer,This is a must-have standard lens for photographers who lacked the extra cash to spend for a faster 50 mm lens.
5,"Believe what other say about this lens, cause it's true","I heard so much about this lens , but was deciding If I would buy the new Nikon d3100 or the P7000..$699 and $499...I tried this lens on my Nikon d70 and now I don't need to upgrade .. even at 6mp the Pictures are Fantastic , Clear , Sharp , nice color., and I saved Hundreds...Sharpness , Clarity , Color is what I look for in a camera this lens does it for me......................I don't know If I will even use my Nikon 18-70 zoom as much any more.."
5,The greatest lens ever,"This lens is pure awesome. Although i have a d60 and cannot use it for auto focus, the nifty 50 has made me experience and enjoy and become good at manual focusing, which is something every photographer should be capable of.I highly recommend every nikon dslr owner out there to have this lens"
4,Nikon 50mm f/1.8D Af Nikkor Lens,I recently added the Nikon 50mm f/1.8D Af Nikkor Lens to my arsenal and after using it have found it to be a very solid lens. The lens is fast and takes sharp pictures. The only adjustment I had to make using this lens was framing the composition of the photo because of a fixed length. Besides that this lens is a great for low light photography or portrait photography
4,Decent purchase for the price,"I suppose it works well, the only thing bad is that you need to manually focus the shots yourself with the Nikon D40. It gets kind of annoying and time consuming especially when you're trying to get that perfect shot of your kids. It's not easy, when they're constantly moving around! However, when you do get the shots, they tend to come out great."
4,was disappointed,"I like mysteries. The first two seasons were great. But this one . . . I knew knew did it from the get. The only question was why and impossible quests since there was never a clueThe second show didn't take much to fill in the blanks. True it was a.guess, but an.accurate one.I am done with Gently. I like Midsomer Murders now. That series is.impossible to make a good or even reasonable guess"
2,Did not keep my interest.,This book started out great but I quit reading about 1/2 to 2/3 the way through because it got boring and repetitive.
3,Until The End......,"Riveting account of peacekeeping operations by my favorite combat author...right up to the end. ""They hunkered down at the Alamo waiting for the final assault, when suddenly..they all lived happily ever after! "" What the heck was that? I will anxiously await the ""Idaho"" explanation. Which will be first...God's Children part 1 or Savage Wilderness part 2?"
2,Loyal Coyle Fan Expect More,"Normally Harold Coyle is such a good read it is hard to put the book down. As a serving military officer, I was looking forward to the subject matter of this book for several months. In my opinion the book fell short of my expectations for an author of his caliber. I got the feeling that the book was written as a labor of love for the first 150 pages and then was shelved for a period of time before it had to be finished in a hurry. Readers need to know up front that the book will fall short of expectations in the end. The book even had some editing and proofing errors that are not normally seen in his work. Normally Harold Coyle's books exceptionally balances the drama of fiction with military realism to a very high degree. This one lost out to drama in a several ways. I will continue to look forward to his next effort, but I will not jump as quickly to buy it as I did this one."
4,A Study in Small Unit Leadership Issues,"Not as solid as Coyle's earlier books but in view of how tough it must have been to base an entire book on a single patrol, it's still a darn good read in its own right. I was reluctant to put it down once I started reading, although I thought the plot fell off at the end as to one of the main characters. I was surprised to find two typos and wondered whether the separate credits to Clausewitz and Napoleon as the source of the theory that morale brings a 3-to-1 ratio to combat was intentional. I didn't read the book with an eye to technical accuracy but rather as a study in junior officer leadership. Would definitely recommend."
2,"Just a bad, bad book.","As others have said below me, the plot (ugh!), character development (next to none) and pacing (sloooow) of this book all leave very much to be desired. The biggest debacle of all however is the ending, which is confounding and contrived to the point of complete unbelievability. Too bad...Harold Coyle's previous books have been great and I will definitely try him again in the future, but I can not recommend God's Children at all."
3,"Very Coyle Loyal, but this was only ok.","Coyle is my favorite fiction writer, but this one does not measure up. It is not as complex or well-developed as his other books are. If you are Coyle loyal, you will want to read it. If you are not, read ""The Ten Thousand"" by Coyle instead."
2,Coyle's Worst,This book was frustrating. Too much was missing or unexplained. For example - What was Dixon's performance in Idaho which was referred to but never described? How were the Hungarians captured just before the end? Who were the final rescuers and how did they get there? It seemed as if large chunks had been cut out or the book written too quickly to meet a deadline. I have all his books but was very disappointed this time
2,Control sensitivity,Slow responce in turning abilities.Also canot calibrate 100%. Crimson Skies is the game and the key board have much faster moverability.
5,May the force be with you!,"Back when 3D cards came out I swore I would never get one as it clearly meant signalling to everyone that you cared enough about wasting your time to actually pay for something that could not be used for serious activity....but naturally, I eventually got one and never looked back. I also used to feel the same way about force feedback. Really, I would say, I'm after what's on the screen, my imagination will do the rest. But here I am, at 1 a.m. with my truly amazing new joystick, trying to keep my WWII fighter plane from rolling over in the heavy winds as I bore in on a pack of bombers. As I pull the trigger, a rumble is heard and my arm trembles from the recoil.....THIS is fun!Installation was a total breeze, by the way, so why wait?"
5,Smooth move,Vey good joystick. plenty of buttons. throttle is better than microsoft joystick. will last me a long time
1,Nice stick- for a while...,"I have had two Logotech sticks: the first, Logitech's Wingman 3D. It lasted a year and a half, but toward the end lost center and never recovered. My second, this one, lasted for 3 months. Then the twist started to go leaving me guessing where neutral on my rudder was (every time). I have read of others who have had similar centering issues: it is a good product out of the box, but the quality of components inside the base are not what I expect.I ended up replacing it with a Saitek Evo Cyborg Force- it may cost a little more, but it is much more adjustable, and the feel is more substantial to me.I won't be buying Logitech again from my experience. Some others may have had better luck- but from the centering issue, well that's pretty basic in any flight sim."
5,Just plain awesome,"I have only used this Joystick for several hours but I can say without a doubt it is just plain awesome. The feedback is great, setup is extremely easy, and the accuracy with which it operates is so realistic I forget that I am at home and not in the aircraft I am flying. The only improvement might be to light up the translucent plastic in the base for true nighttime fun."
4,Pretty Good Book,"Okay, this book, was really good. There were a few things I did not like about it though. Like, why are ""shrinks"" so stupid, it was clearly the mothers fault for the girls anorexia. This book has made me cry everytime I read it, and I've only owned it for about 2 weeks. I love it. It's so true, trust me, I know how she felt."
2,Hm.,"I couldn't help but be a bit offended by this book. I mean, I read the whole thing and it wasn't terrible, but it didn't portray eating disorders in a way that I would want individuals who have not suffered from the disorder themselves to see. ""Wasted"" by Marya Hornbacher is much more realistic and a better use of one's reading time."
1,Another book filled with nonsense,"This book isn't worth the paper it's written on. What a stupid bunch of nonsense. If you have given this pathetic book any thought whatsoever, don't listen to it. Buy this book if you can afford the ten-bucks for fire starter in your fireplace."
2,A Shallow Look at a Disturbing Subject,"I was quite disturbed by this book, not because of the subject matter, but by the cavalier treatment of it. The final resolution was scripted enough for a sitcom; does such a terrible disorder really just go away from one look in a mirror? I also was a little put off by Lori Gottlieb's self-aggrandizing attitude toward her intelligence. And the life-sized portrait on the back cover did nothing to dissuade my opinion of her as a self-absorbed Beverly Hills brat."
2,Lacking...,"As I am in recovery myself, I expected to find something I could relate to in this book. However, I found that the case of Ms. Gottlieb just didn't ring true to life. This book does little to portray the grip of obsession that anorexia can have over one's life, nor did it describe the heartbreak that can come with this disorder. Most troubling was the book's conclusion, in which Lori seemed to realize, in a bolt-from-the-blue fashion, that her eating disorder wasn't worth it. Amazing how a person could magically get over an eating disorder so quickly! To recover from anorexia requries a lot of effort, and although I'm sure Lori Gottlieb must have put forth that effort in her own life, she certainly didn't clearly portray that in her book."
5,So True,"I loved it, and I find it amazing how similar Lori's eleven year old thoughts and experiences were to mine (at eleven). I wish this book had been around when I was growing up and I'm glad it exists for other teen and pre-teen girls today."
1,"Flat, boring and a waste of time",This book just teaches you how to have a worse eating disorder. The author creates a simplistic view of the forces behind eating disorders.
4,DISTANT LAND OF MY FATHER...GOOD BOOK,"THE BOOK IS A NOVEL WRITTEN AS A MEMOIR. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY REAL AND WELL DRAWN. I CARED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REALISTIC. THE CHINESE HISTORY AND THE DESCRIPTIONS OF SHANGHAI WERE MOST INTERESTING. THIS IS A ""MUST READ""."
4,Wow!,"Rated 4 stars only because it is not a classic, but wow, is this book good! The story is fabulous, the premise and message are powerful, and it is unbelievably well written. As close to a must read as there is!"
1,Author's information inaccurate,"The Author should investigate his own lineage, to determine who his Father's oldest sister was before he put it down on paper. Powerful and full of imagery, but full of inaccurate information and embelishments. The Macioci Family, those who survive, pray this author can finally put his childhood behind him and leave us alone. TIME marches on and it is TIME to get on with it!!!! It is interesting that the ONLY review, other than this one, comes from his half brother and a friend."
2,"I read all of it, but just barely","In the book's favor, the desire to find out what would happen kept me reading until the end, but that was all that kept me going.This book was not well-written, had over-the-top stereotypes as characters, was funny in about two places, was badly edited, and was very formulaic. I would not read another book of Ms. Heller's. Luckily, I didn't buy this one: it was loaned to me by a friend. I recommend reading Bridget Jones again or reading _Simply Divine_ if you want a decent novel of this type."
4,It's Okay to Make Fun of People,"The reviewers who stated that they didn't like the book for a variety of reasons, just didn't understand what JH was trying to say. JH was making fun of how males/females communicate. JH wasn't trying to write a ""know it all"" book on the subject. She was shedding light on a very humorous issue. I think a lot of the reviewers saw themselves in the ""scripts"" and they didn't like what they read. If you can't laugh at how differently men and women think, then you won't enjoy this book.I enjoyed the book. It was easy to read. Each character stood alone. I would have given it 5 stars if the epilogue would have included information about the ""friends"" and her assistant. It seems JH forgot they existed in the epilogue. That was a mistake."
3,loads of history,this books is good if your using it is as a source for a paper I did and I got an A in the class.
5,A Whole Lotta Fun,"There's a whole lotta fun in this autobiography. Hagman is a great teller of hilarious stories. It seems amazing he survived long enough to need a liver transplant, that's how wild some of his earlier adventures were. The transplant tale is inspirational and informative too. Being a fan of his helps, but Hagman's story is really an inspired blueprint of living with gusto no matter of the times are good or bad. Hagman has lived, and readers get to laugh. That's a good value, if you ask me."
1,Had to cancel order - Hidden additional shipping charge,"This generator weighs 191 pounds. The day after I ordered it, I was sent an email saying that I would be responsible for taking it off the truck, but that for an additional $39 I could have ""lift gate"" service: the item would be taken off the truck and placed on the road near my driveway. The $39 is in addition to the $79 shipping fee that was charged with my order. The email also suggested that I might want to consider picking the item up at the freight terminal with a few of my friends in lieu of the truck option. When I called the vendor's (Gizzly) customer service representative, she confirmed that all of this is simply standard delivery practice. I don't appreciate hidden charges, nor was I willing to pay $79 to go to a freight terminal to pick it up myself."
4,Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis - Vol 2,"A nice collection of old movies, none by themselves are worth watching unless you are fans of the Matin/Lewis style antics of yesteryear and want to take a trip down memory lane. However, if you pay attention through the flicks you WILL get a chance to enjoy moments of comic brilliance by Jerry, albeit sporadically."
4,FREAKY!,I liked this book because it has to to with alot of real-life ghost stories.I would recomend this book to anyone who likes ghost stories or freaky/out of this world stories.
2,Not Green!!,I was very disappointed in the shade of this polish. I don't know why I didn't read the other reviews before purchasing! The color is definitely blue...not green at all!
3,"Pretty color, but not great","This is a pretty color, an iridescent greenish blue. Not really green. It also dries really slowly and takes at least three coats for good coverage."
3,Earlier arrival,"Personally, I didn't like the product, but it was a gift to my sister, and she really loved it. She has been using this product for more than 5 years. It arrived earlier than scheduled, in perfect conditions."
3,Some Chick's Theme Song,"This song is okay and I like the guest appearance by Too Short. The beginning of the song is great, and so is the chorus, but you would think with a song called ""Bossy"" that the sassiness would be continued throughout the song and it's not. Kelis's vocals were basically bland. Other than that, an okay song."
5,funny but insightful,"this book is not only entertaining and funny, it's insightful and helpful. I really related! I found myself in the pages and could give myself grace and joy in the midst of seeing some evidence of aging--even at 54!"
3,"OK, but slow autofocus","I tried this lens out for a few weeks. I was shooting it on a Nikon D300. I found the autofocus was too slow for my liking. The image quality was decent, but fairly soft wide open. The zoom on this thing is great, but the zoom is worthless if you can't get the autofocus to track fast enough for moving objects.Anyway, if you're looking for a lens with good zoom capabilities and will be photographing mostly still objects, than this lens is great. If you plan to shoot sports with fast action, you will probably be disappointed."
5,Love it,"I used the Nikon 80-400mm lens with my D200 for the first time last week at my kids lacrosse game. Before purchasing this lens, I was a little concerned about some of the comments here that the autofocus is slow to react. I took about 100 pics at the game, and had one that was slightly out of focus. All other pics were incredibly sharp. I think this is a great lens."
5,Nikon 80 - 400 lens,"Excellent lens, very flexible, but you need a monopod or tripod. It's heavy but worth it's weight in gold!"
5,My Favorite,"I love this cologne. I have been wearing it for about 37 years, and during that time I have received many compliments on the scent....even from strangers. I have tried the other newer Jovan Musk scents, but none of them compare to this one. It's a keeper."
2,THIS PENCIL WAS ON A STARVATION DIET!,"The tip of this pencil is SOOOO tiny, that the pencil breaks quiet easily. Seriously if you want to apply one eyebrow hair at a time, then this is the product for you.The rest of us are busy, and this takes far too much time. The packaging is cheap; the plastic covering the other end of the pencil just fell off and won't stay on.The color is okay,I usually love Almay products, but this one I regret purchasing."
3,I love and Hate it..,"I have owned this watch just over a year now, and Im sad to say its does not stand up to daily wear. The ""polished"" Steel wears out very quickly and the under is a ugly bronze color, which cheapens the look of this watch. However I LOVE the Swarovski bling, and I do get compliments on this watch daily.."
1,The cheapest watch I've ever owned.,"This watch is the cheapest one I have ever owned. It says water resistent to 99 ft. This is inaccurate. Water gets into it when showering. Bulova also has terrible customer service. They charge you a $ handling fee to have them fix it. When my watch was returned it was not fixed. Now Bulova says water resistence does not mean protection from water and they are not sure if my watch will be covered under warranty. I wish I had purchased a cheap one from Walmart, because their $10 watches are of much higher quality than this one. Do not buy this watch or any other Bulova if you would like quality!"
5,Bulova Women's Crystal Watch purchased via Amazon.com,I love this watch! Swarovski crystals give this watch an extremely elegeant look. I wear it most all of the time and am truely thrilled with how it looks as well as the fact that it is a Bulova! I have not seen a watch that is more beautiful since I found this one. [...]
1,Not water resistant.....,"Bought this watch for my wife and within a week use of the watch, water got into it... for a $150 thats the last thing you would expect. On top of that I have to pay for shipping to repair this piece of junk..."
5,I'd Love To Nibble This Vampire Hero,"Christopher Marlowe is damned sexy for a guy who's been dead for 400 years. I can see why Dixie LePage is drawn to him. Too bad she has to deal with murder, mayhem, and blackmail, too! Rosemary Laurey writes a neck-nibbling tale designed to satisfy any lover of vampire romances. Thank God there's a sequel!"
4,Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!,"Adorable little comedy about relationships. Robert Downey Jr. was ever so delightful as a wacky German ski instructor with a bit of a secret. His love scene was priceless, I coudln't stop laughing! In fact, Downey stole the film, even tho his on screen time wasn't much, compared to all the others in the film."
1,Beef Jerky for the Brain,"As one reader comments, this book is ""a must for any serious Hollywood History library."" Yes--in the same sense that the complete works of Ed Wood belong in every comprehensive home video collection."
4,NOTEBOOK ACCESSORY KIT,This kit is a great value. For the money you can't beat it! The wireless mouse and the USB calculator are so handy! Highly Recommend!!
5,HAK U UP,DARK AND ambiant this cd is cool with alot of sampeling klanks and mello beats i really enjoy clocks work and you will to go get it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Chokes on faxes with lots of text,I'd give it a zero star if I could...it chokes on faxes with lots of text on the page. A worthless machine unless you are sure you will be receiving pages which do not have much text.
2,disappointed,"I received the candy wrappers and they look purple in the picture, but when I got them they were more pink. I followed the return instructions given to me and sent the wrappers back. I was then accused of not putting the wrappers in the box and told I would not be getting a refund. After some emailing back and forth, they did end up issuing me a refund. However, I had emailed with a person named Nic and he made a rude comment."
4,Sinatra's choice,"This is the cologne that Frank Sinatra used. It smells like Lavender, clean and fresh. It's a man's scent, not sweet and flowery, and admittedly a bit dated when compared to today's more feminine smelling fragrances. I use it often. It's good for work, doesn't over power."
5,Can't wait for this - love this show,Watched this show from the beginning and have all 7 seasons. Can't wait to get this one. Can't help wondering what the difference is between this set and the other shown as Season 8 and Final Series which looks like it's a little bit more money and it looks like it's available now. This was one great show and I recommend it highly.
4,dvd,"item included 4 dvds, three of the four were fine, fourth one had pauses in viewing it, item described as new. very good shipping time.."
3,CORRECTION TO MY REVIEW,"Hi there and apologies for bothering you. Judy Bachrach has contacted me to point out that when I say an anecdote was repeated twice at the start of the book, I should in fact have said an entire quote. I know this sounds like splitting hairs, but she seems a little perturbed by this and so if you could change the review to make it 100 percent accurate I'd be very grateful. Many thanks in advance for your understanding.David Ljunggren"
5,Essential!,"I'll keep this short... if you love the guitar you need this recording along with the other Deutsche-Grammaphon complilations (The Art of Segovia and the boxed set). The recordings are beautifully remastered!They didn't see fit to put the recitation of the poem on ""Platero & I,"" just Segovia's guitar work, understandably. You can find it with the recitation on one of the MCA Classics releases from the late 80's/early 90's (The Segovia Collection, Vol. 8), which are brilliant for their organization of the Maestro's catalogue by category."
3,Binding shot,"Book was advertised as ""very good"" condition. I expected some wear on the pages, but the binding was no longer attached to the cover. At this price point, it is not useful to complain or ask for a refund. The important point is that the words and definitions are there for a five year old."
4,"Its made for your car, it comes with a plug for your car","Beautiful picture and the sound is good, even better through the headphones, No ware on this product do they imply that it has batteries, it is made to be used in your CAR, the box says Mobile not cordless. I paid 179.00 at sams club for 2 players cords etc. So far I am going to give it a thumbs up."
1,Get Owl Clip Light at 'real' store,"Having used the Owl Clip Light with success previously, chose to order through Amazon (to a secondary provider)for a gift. The gift finally arrived, broken and unable to be used. Also, at the same time, ordered one to keep for future gift - it has never arrived.Probably will never order through a secondary provider again."
1,Very disappointing,"I wanted to buy a smaller booklight that didn't have to have 4 AA batteries. I have used the Mighty Bright for so many years, but the batteries make it very heavy, especially at late night reading sessions. I thought this would work out great due to the advertisements. I paid the 9.99 which I figured was okay - but realized after I got it home that the clip is not secure enough, the neck not long enough to fit over the book pages and the light does not light up the whole page. The clip kept falling off of the book and eventually I gave up. I'll just have to stick with the Mighty Bright. Hopefully someone will come up with a lighter weight book light - this Book Owl is just not worth the money spent or the time to take it back."
1,Please don't buy this,"I made the mistake of buying this, and other books by the author, thinking there would be something worthwhile in there. I then checked every reviewer and realized that his books were the only ones they reviewed. Way to ask your friends to hype your book up buddy! I hope you at least paid them."
4,Fado Curvo,"Mariza's voice is beautiful like always. It's a good cd. Some songs I like and others I didn't, but for anyone who likes fados I would pick any of her CD's!!!"
3,Spahn Ranch - 'Blackmail Starters Kit' (Cleopatra),"Decent six song mini CD by the electro-industrial unit known as Spahn Ranch. If I remember correctly, I used to keep in touch on a regular basis with one of these members. It's been awhile now and I recall this disc being released on Cleopatra around the same time that key titles by Die Krupps, Front 242 and Front Line Assembly had hit the stores. Been a few years since I sat down and put in one of these CD's. Not bad for a an EP, as the best two tracks are the demo for ""Commination"" and the *ss-kicking ""Kenneth, What's Your Frequency?"". Last I saw here, the Amazon asking price was 10 cents for the CD - how could you go wrong?"
2,Not activities - worksheets,"I ordered this book because it said ""activities"" in the titile. These are worksheets. Nice worksheets but still worksheets. Activities are hands-on, creative, problem solving. Not paper and pencil."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I should have read the reviews before plunking 20$ on this mouse... The battery compartment and the small cover look so cheap...but that's not the problem. The mouse is all jumpy and erratic, and doesn't respond well. I'm back with my old corded Targus travel mouse, which works like a charm, and is smoothly responsive to my hand movements."
1,Useless,"This thing is practically unusable, the mouse doesn't move where you want it to, it jumps around. Their customer service was admittedly nice, they gave me a list of things that might help, but none of them worked, so I still have to give it only one star. It would have been better to spend the money on practically any other mouse out there, even if it were a trackball mouse."
1,Don't bother,"This is NOT a scholarly work. The author mixes quotes from reputable scholars with mostly unfounded surmise. The main topic of the book is not medieval music but New Age philosophy.The author's lack of knowledge of the basic conditions of medieval life is immense. For instance, she refers to a ""schoolyard"" with children playing in it in medieval Germany."
3,Diana's Boys,"This IS a rehash but the one thing that keeps coming through in all the books written about Diana is how twisted the Windsor clan is. I would challenge any woman who thinks she's marrying someone who loves her (she, sadly, was simply breeding stock)to take a position in this kind of family and have any hope of a modern, caring-for-others, compassionate life. It's a marvel she fared as well as she did, poor thing. She had her problems but the Royal family are a pack of jackels."
5,You Gotta Read This Book!!!,"Listen folks this isn't some hokas pokas fairytale stuff. You don't even have to believe that it works. It doesn't care if you believe... it works anyway. It's working right now in YOUR life whether you believe it or not.Look at everything you have in your life right now. THAT'S THE LAW OF ATTRACTION!!!. YOU ATTRACTED IT. So if the stuff you have is not the stuff you want, including the type of person you long to be, READ THIS BOOK! It will tell you exactly what you need to do to turn your life around. I can't stress enough how absolutely powerful this information is."
3,So-So rehash,"I gave this book a 3 because I like the subject matter. For someone who knows nothing about the Law of Attraction, I would suggestThe Secret. The book rehashes all the LoA stuff with nothing new. I was looking for a step-by-step approach but this wasn't it. In retrospect, I do recommendLaw of Attraction: The Science of Attracting More of What You Want and Less of What You Don'tbecause it is a step-by-step approach.Buy this book but don't expaect anything new."
3,students with severe disabilities,"Lots of good information about students with severe disabilities and some practical tips. The authors' philosophy is complete integration for all students. A wonderful idea, but I am dismayed that there is little mention of placing students according to what will work best for them. Every student has a different LRE and different needs."
4,A good fit and comfortable,"I couldn't be sure before purchasing whether it would be the correct fit for me, since I could only order based on my usual sizing for other brands. However, it has turned out ok. The 18"" neck size is correct, and the length of the shirt would be perfect for someone taller than I am (6'). But can't really complain when it's longer, since that'd be definitely better than shorter, hey.The material seems to be of rather heavy cotton, which is how I like it.It's good."
5,Best Nosferatu album,"WTF!!! anyone who says this album sucks obviously doesn't like Goth rock. This is the best Nosferatu album. I am a fan of the band and like all of their albums, this was the first album I got, and at first I was like this is really lame but after about 5 or 6 listens I was hooked. This is real vampire rock."
1,Buyer beware!,"This is a really terrible album - I was very dissapointed when I bought it several years back. Many of the songs are laugh out loud cheesy - not just your typical goth dramatic melancholy and metaphor (which we all enjoy immensely, don't we?), but actually over the top ridiculous. Don't waste your money on this CD - buy 'Rise' instead - it's much, much better."
5,This is a great camping and hiking attachment!,"Smaller that a Machette, yet big enough to hack your way out of any Back Woods excurtion or your own back yard!Nicely crafted with good quality materials including the shieth!"
2,Sound Quality Disapointing,This is a SACD that sounds bad. The violin work is very nice but the recording is not good. If you are into sound quality I do not recomend this CD.
4,Well worth it!,"I was looking for a way to get better sound and tone in my recording, and I was fairly sure I'd need a condenser mic. The spc-25 replaced a high-end mike I've had for years, and it is exactly what I needed. It's a condenser, but it doesn't require phantom power. Bottom line- It's a decent, cheap mike."
2,worked well for a while,"Bought it 2 years and 2 months ago. It failed and wouldn't you know it, it only has a 2 year warranty. Its firewall has always slowed things down and been very tempermental. Usually it runs better with th firewall turned off. After it died, I bought another brand, one that had a better warranty."
5,Wonderful storytelling by one of my favorite authors.,This is the final book I have read by this author. I devoured her other two and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. It was just as thrilling and as informative as her others. I have passed this one on to friends as I did the others. We have formed a new Beverly Jenkins fan club!!! Please give us more!
1,Dropping connection every 2-3 hours !!!,"I simply hate it.Every 2-3 hours I have to reboot it.Also I upgraded it through internet to the latest firmware.Is it something else or the modem itself I can't tell, but with the same line and PC there were no such problems.All I have changed besides the modem is the router, a D-Link DGL-4500.Before that I used the 2wire 2700HG-B worked GREAT ...Well, I simply don't recommend it."
2,Prolix,"This is a book with some clever ideas, but like so much else written on 18th Century Britain, it sacrifices scholarship for trendiness. Wilson looks at the bizarre and mistakes them as representative. Ultimately, this is an exercise in 21st century political correctness, not 18th century Britain."
4,A strong showing in this excellent series,"I gave the other two showing in this series 5 stars, and this one would have received 5 also except for some small points. In certain chapters especially the first few, the story thread seemed to be disjointed in parts. But these were few and far between. The storylines regarding Sharing, Cashel, and Ilna were all extremely well done, letting us see deeper into their characters as a whole (especially liked Cashel's part). Garric was busy being King, so his was a tad weaker than usual, but the others easily made up for it. All in all, highly recommended."
2,Let down....,"The first book was good. The 2nd book was a minimal thumbs up,but this last book has been rather dull. The classic fantasy motiffsare paraded about, the characters start to become like broken records in terms of personality traits, and i get tired of hearing how tall and big all our protagonists are (oh, and btw, I know how cranky Ilna is at this point!). A good series gone bad. Save your time, save your money, and save yourself from another standard fantasy epic (read Geroge R.R. Martin's GAME OF THRONES or CLASH OF KINGS to see *real* characters embedded in a fanstasy world)"
3,Older than I expected,"I bought this system used. Everthing still works, but for $385, I expected it to be newer. The label in the back indicates that it was made in 1997. The box is no longer white, but yellowish. After overcoming the initial disappointment, I am beginng to like it."
4,Good...For the most part.,"The Logitech Freedom Navigator is a very tight keyboard and mouse combo. And for the price, it's pretty good. Instalation is fairly easy. It takes around 10 mins and isn't to hard to do. The mouse ""grip"" is wonderful. It fits in your hand perfectly. The keyboard is very nice too. The ""play/pause"" button [stinks] though. It's more like a stop button. And you'll really never use the buttons much either. But all the same, it's a good keyboard. A lil problem. Sometimes the mouse and keyboard get a little sketchy... And it is a bit annoying. But all you have to do is reconnect. So it's not a life-threatening problem :) And I really wish the mouse were optical. That is a major downer. But overall it's pretty good."
2,"Keyboard is Great, but Mouse Fails","I purchased the wireless keyboard and mouse combination. The keyboard worked great--I would give it 5 stars--but I couldn't get the mouse to establish radio contact. I exchanged it for a new one twice more with the same result. I am a fairly technical person (so is my roommate) and since set up is not complicated at all, I'm quite certain that the reason for the mouse's failure was not a result of something I and my roommate did.And there is no customer service number.I would wait until this technology develops a little more. Then I would jump on it. The wireless keyboard, for it's part was well worth the money."
2,Dull IDM.,"Marion is the merging of new tracks and ones previously found on the Demon EP's. It is pure IDM, matching chunky, harsh beats with lighter synth melodies. They problem is the both the melodies and the beats are dull. It is like IDM by numbers. The beats sound garage oriented, never quite doing anything inparticular and some sounding very uninspired and sloppy. The melodies are quite tame and uninteresting... barely maintaining any depth or catchiness, while most IDM has one or the other. What interests me in IDM is the depth of production, which unusually involves either sparse, emotionally driven melodies or harsh, crafty beats. Marion has vague hints of this, but in general it has neither."
5,"Elegant, gorgeous","Listen once and you may find this album only mildly affective (vs. effective). Listen twice and you begin to hear things you may think were not there in a ghostly fashion the first time around. Listen more and you shall be astonished at the altitude of the supremely crafted composition of Eberhard Weber's work on this very underrated album: Endless Days. Easily summarized, if you love great music, of any genre, buy this masterpiece. One of the finest whole cloth works of ""Jazz""created in the last 25 years. (Maybe it's time to cease these rather narrow genre categories. These set of pieces are more than Jazz, closer to classical perhaps. I encourage also to listen to Weber's Pendulum album, which is also incredible music.)P.S. I should mention also the amazing playing and musicianship of his cohort on this album and several others, woodwind specialist Paul McCandless (late of work with Oregon and Ralph Towner among others.)"
3,"Excellent music, pitiful vocals and lyrics.","I would have liked to give this CD a better rating, but the embarrassingly bad singing and lyrics really destroyed alot of the album's potential. I wish that german industrial bands would sing most of their songs in german, because it is such a powerful and heavy language which complements the genre perfectly. On the other hand, the music on this CD is unquestionably some of the best industrial I've ever heard. In fact, I liked the music on this album so much that I copied all the CD tracks to my computer and remixed them to get rid of the intolerable vocals."
5,Great for toddlers/preschoolers!,My family absolutely loves Max & Ruby. This video is no exception. The lemonade episode is great & my son always wants lemonade after he sees it. Hippity Hop Dance is another favorite as well as Super Max. Max is so mischiveous. A great family video to own.
1,No sumber party is complete without ???,"What do you think off when someone asks:No slumber party is complete without ...?Pillow fight, board games, lemonade, jumping on beds?Not in this show.Here is what the authors put in the mouth of Ruby:1 fashion magazine2 makeover3 catwalkIf you want to bring up your kid to be a slave to fashion and consumption. Let's watch this dvd often.Otherwise stay away. Better check out the Backyardigans."
3,"Pay a bit more and buy 16 gauge, this stuff is ok though","I bought this stuff without doing enough reading. I would recommend buying 16 gauge for just a few dollars more. However, one benefit of 18 gauge is that it is easier to hide under the edge of your carpets.Delivery was prompt. No complaints there."
2,radio guy,"I bought a roll of this stuff and found that you have to use scissors to cut the 2 wires apart, this is not zip wire, if you try to zip it apart it will tear to the wire. This is a pain in the field. Also this wire is STIFF, or maybe it's just old. It is good grade of wire, just hard to work with."
2,Junk,"Shipping and Order was perfect. The speaker wire is junk. Plastic wire wrap is super thin, makes it very hard to cut ends off. Cheap wire, save your money."
2,Speaker wire,"Came on time and worked OK, however, the wire strands are extremely flimsy and break easy when making connections."
3,Good overview of the French and Indian War,"This book is little more than an overview of the French and Indian War, and not a discussion of the British Army during this period. The plates are well done, and a number of illustrations are included, among them some of the few contemporary depictions of British soldiers of this period."
3,sweetened cranberries,"Although they did not specify , when I received these cranberries I was disappointed to learn they were sweetened with sugar . If you dont mind sugar they are great , was looking for a sugar free product ."
3,It's decent.,"Carmageddon on GBC is nothing at all like the PC version of course,so graphically it's GBC quality.It does look pretty good played on the GBA SP(thats what I use).The view is also top down naturally.The gameplay is not the best,but I guess it could be alot worse.There are some cool vehicles that you can use to run over zombies(at least that's what I think they are) and splatter them all over the roads.There also is a decent amount of levels that you can play through.It's best to just use the cheat code and unlock all the cars and tracks without having to go through the trouble of doing it yourself.The password is 0Z6SZD(SKULL)V Overall,Carmageddon is decent on GBC but far from perfect.It is a nice little portable time killer I guess."
1,Even Sister Wendy Can't Save This Book,"I love Sister Wendy. I really do. But this book can not be saved by anyone. The pictures are edited poorly. Some are too small, while others stretch across the binding in a cheap distracting fashion. I often found myself turning the book and saying, ""Is that someone's head or foot?""Sister Wendy rarely has much to say about most of the pieces in this book. No trademark historical, technical, or interesting little tid-bit. Just a few words about how much she likes this or that, no reason for her favoritism just a few words of positive acknowledgement.Many other Sister Wendy books are well worth the money, but not this one."
5,Extraordinary in every way,"Among the many brilliant things about this recording (and the DVD version) is the musicality of the entire enterprise. The JACK quartet plays this incredible music with elan, energy and emotion. Bravo to this young and terrific quartet."
4,Great performer,"I use these batteries in my portable CD player, my digital camera, my electric toothbrush and my electric hair-curling brush. They are very convenient and work well. Not sure yet how long they last in the camera, but I'l be testing that in August.They completely recharge (the little light chnages from red to green ont he charger) in about a day and half, so it's a good idea to have an extra set. It's still better (and cheaper) than buying Alkaline batteries and throwing them away."
5,It worked fine for me,"I got this charger and battery set several months ago and used the charger to charge both NiMH and old NiCd batteries. So far, I have no complaints myself. The LEDs on my charger do become green after the charging is done. At the time I bought this charger, there were several negative reviews about defective charger but I thought it probably worth the risk since the price is not too much more than just the batteries. I guess the plant that manufactured the charger is not ISO 9000 certified and may have a higher defective rate than the brands of much higher cost. But they ought to make much more good ones so I believe your chance to get a functional one is still good if you are willing to take a little risk here."
2,"The charger is not bad, the battery is really poor...","The charger is not bad although charging time is very long. Well, the price is low and it is said that slow charge is better for the battery. But the battery is really poor... From the words on the battery, I guess it is 1700mah, however, someone told me that it is 1600 mah. I compared the battery with the panasonic 1600mah ni-MH battery I got...panasonic worked 5 hours and 45 minutes, while Millenium worked only 4 hours and 30 minutes. Poor battery! I will never buy batteries without capacity on its label. It is sure that the manufacturer is not confident about its capacity/quality."
4,I have no complaints with Millenium batteries,"I bought my first set of these things literally a decade ago, and shock of shocks they still work (NiCd variant). I used to consider their lifetime warranty something of a joke. I bought another set recently and am quite happy - these are NiMH."
4,Another Sparkling Classical Change Of Pace!,"As one of five classical pieces that Elvis Costello composed since the early-1990's, Elvis Costello would again delight listeners and critics alike with this significant work of classical art in 2004, the same year he would release the electrifying rock and roll masterpiece The Delivery Man with his next band line-up Elvis Costtello And The Imposters. Il Sogno is a fascinating but challenging classical CD that certainly ranks as one of his best classical works, just compared to the powerful rock god he would become in the late-1970's when the Punk Rock Movement shook rock and roll to the cores of it's foundation and gave the music more fresh and radical energy. For those who have listened to his four classical CD's, including The Juliet Letters and North, Il Sogno again proves that he can deliver a highly successful classical hit on special occasions, and one that ranks as one of his finest works."
2,What happened???,"I can't believe that I actually spent money on this before listening to it. If I had, I'd be $8 richer and believe me, I wouldn't mind, money's so tight right now! This is by far, one of the worst cds I've bought this year-its' actually painful to my ears. The lyrics suck and the music, well, I wish I could say something positive. I guess the only thing going for this cd is the first 2 tracks, but you can find ""Friends & Executioners"" on Wired Injections (Cleopatra Records) and that cd is a much better investment than this, dare I say, album. Save your money kids."
2,Good Layout - Shoddy Quality,"I got two of these as gift. One controller went bad, and then the other. The problem is that the 6 buttons on the right spring back up after pushing them down partially because they are attached to some medicore plastic chassis inside the controller. Anyone who pushes these buttons repeatedly(I do this for speed bursts and checks in EA NHL games) will ultimately break the button away from the plastic. As a result, the buttons will start to stick. To put it another way, you push down, but the button doesn't come back up. I took one apart and cleaned the buttons out a little, and seems to be functional again, but the responsiveness of the buttons is not what it used to be and it's only a matter of time before the buttons go bad again. And another thing, there's too much space between the buttons and the controller, and it allows grit to get into the controller and affects the buttons, too. I'm probably going to get a gravis next time."
3,Keeps losing its callibration settings,"It's a good-sized pad, with good force feedback. Unfortunately, the left analog stick keeps losing its callibration settings every 30 minutes and refused to go right after a while. The only way to re-callibrate it: plug it out of the USB port and re-connect it. Then you have to switch our of the game to the profiler application to tell it to apply your profile setting again. A serious annoyance."
2,calibration problems,"As one of the other reviewers mentioned, there seems to be a calibration problem with the left joystick, at least in the batch that Amazon is selling (and Logitech doesn't make this model anymore, so you can't get a fresh one). I've tried two of them and in both cases, the left joystick won't stay centered."
3,This is a PS2 Clone,"I've had this pad for 2 years and have to say its my favorite. Other controllers I've used like the Interact Hammerhead and Radioshack analog multipad had really poor pots in thier analog sticks and never held calibration for more than a minute. Im now on my second rumble pad (the force feedback motors and the analog sticks broke off on th old one).If you were to take this controller and a PS2 controller apart and compare their analog components, you would see that thier identical, which is good because PS2's have the best analog sticks i've used. The major difference between this controller and a PS2 is the throttle slider on the right top corner of the pad, IHMO the space would have been better used to put 2 extra sholder buttons Left and right. I have yet to find any use for the throttle slider, it seems like more of a gimmick than a usable feature."
5,This is the rumble pad you need for your PC,I love this game pad. I have worn out 4 of them. I will continue to buy this pad till it becomes unavailable. Yes I play games on my computer that much. I don't like wireless game pads they use batteries. So if anyone from logitech is reading this review. Don't stop making these. I'm sure I will need another one soon. I don't know what else to say to encourage you to buy this product. Hey don't buy it. That will leave more of them for me. :)
5,Good controller,"I bought this controller years ago, but only opened it recently. It loaded perfectly with Windows XP, and I used it for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. It worked very well, even though it isn't considered a joystick, but it did the job. It even has a throttle switch."
1,"like every other gamepad I had for the pc, a piece of junk","This pad fall in the catagorey of all the games pads for the pc that I have tried. CRAP!!!! It broke after a week of play. The software that came with it was good, but all the software in the world can't make up. I threw it into the street in frustration. Why can't they make a durable game pad for pc's? They have them for console systems."
3,"Okay for flying games, stinks for anything else","The layout of the pad is nice...two joysticks, directional pad, and lots of buttons, all within reach. Throw into that the rumblepad and its pretty nice. However, when actually using this pad, I've found it pretty difficult going.The direction pad is almost impossible to use because the buttons are quite hard to push and hold down, and likewise the buttons are quite difficult to use. Overall, I find the pad to be very uncomfortable. Logitech had a good idea with planning this pad, they just should have tried actually using it too."
2,"Works kind of, for a little while","I usually like Logitech products, which is why I'm amazed they would actually put their name on this garbage. To start with, 2 out of the 7 push buttons have intermittent faults while pressing down continuously. The 8 way directional hat, has a hard time detecting presses to the right. The left Joystick looses it's calibration after about twenty to forty five minutes of game play. After that, it simply will not go to the right. Since it was decided that this stick was above mere calibration, none was included. The only way to resolve the problem is to reboot the computer when this happens. A real mood killer while playing any game. I'm a avid gamer and have other game pads, wheels and sticks, so no it's not the computer or USB port. They all work fine, I just thought this one would be better. Next time I'll think a little harder if it say's Logitech on it."
4,I'm liking this book!,"Initially, I was concerned that the questions were from the 1995 exam, but the questions are still valid today. Also, any question now obsolete has been removed explaining that it's no longer valid. I'm on test 3 from the book and will be moving on to the final test next week. Once completed, I will go to Wiley 2012 text to continue to push through. I've already purchased the FAR Computerized Test Bank and many of the questions match Barron's.I'm learning quite a bit fron Barrons and having a few ""a ha"" moments. It's not derailing what I've learned thus far nor is it taking me backwards. If anything, this book is enhancing my teachings. I feel more confident, especially after checking online and comparing some of the book's responses to online information.Not a bad tool at all."
5,Let the adventures begin!,"To quote the author, ""Take nothing for granted in your surroundings. Edit from your life that which does not inspire you and replace it with items and energies that feel adventurous.""The day before my birthday, I told a friend that I intended to make the coming year better than the last. My goal was to view ""life as an adventure."" The next day, I spotted David Silberkleit's little book in a gift shop, and I instantly knew that it was meant for me! Inside, I found 541 interesting (and often unusual!) ways to add pizzazz to everyday life.Since reading this book, I have been editing from my life those things that don't inspire me, and, in doing so, I have discovered just how easy, fun, and energizing it truly is when you start viewing life from a different (and somewhat zanier!) perspective. For an entertaining and inspiring read, choose A New Adventure Every Day. You, too, will discover that adventures are everywhere, just waiting for you to become a part of them. Join in!"
2,Disappointing....,"This DVD is about Sifu Wong's family and top students demostration in weapons, forms, and kung fu workout. There was also interviews with Sifu Wong and his wife. Some candid clips were added in.Watching a movies would be more exciting and entertaining. BUY ONLY if you are fan of Sifu Wong OR got extra money to spare."
2,Boring with some exceptions...,"I'm not a professional belly dancer and my judgements are mostly based on ""I like it / I don't like it"" impression. Although content of this DVD was quite disappointing as a whole there still were few tracks worth watching.Ariellah is stunning with her every move so refined and perfectionned. Her Siren is my absolutely favorite track - a gorgeous example of American Tribal style. Asharah is also OK but not as controlled and her moves seem to be not sharp enough. Neon's dances are beautiful. A friend of mine also liked Jeniviva's second performance. The rest was simply boring. Jehan's video was disturbing if not even disgusting. Brrr.Bottomline: with the exception of two or three tracks this DVD is not worth wasting your money."
2,Ghastly Gothic!!,"Ghastly gothic and I don't mean that in a horrific, slasher-type murderous way!!! This is just plain AWFUL--can't try to ""try out"" or ""take on"" goth--it's innate! Goth is much more than donning black clothing, kohl makeup and APPEARING eerie! Now onto the bellydance review. I do not dispute that all the featured bellydancers are skilled and talented, but (outside of Ariellah--who is an interwoven gothic energy) should continue to master and mix their true passion and stay within these realms as opposed to trying to be gothic. Graphics--oh--the graphics?? The graphics were just as horrible. I was expecting the bellydancer to be on stage with props as opposed to some ill-laden graphics as an after effect. This production did not hold my interest and I am actually typing this review while the DVD is playing. I would NOT recommend this DVD. It was much more entertaining to watch the 4 minute 55 second clip of Espana Gothla 2010 than 85 minutes of......"
3,View and Go Gothic Belly Dance,"I find that when this DVD came out a lot of Tribal Belly Dance fans and teachers went haywire to practice the moves they saw on this DVD, and incorporate it into their choreography (at least in South Florida). I watched the DVD and it is great for viewing purposes. It is great that a new fusion of Belly Dance has come out. It just shows that the dance is expanding and ever growing. This DVD is great to refer to and to teach yourself while watching it. Namaste."
3,"Won't be Watched often, but interesting..","Another closet Goth and recent Bellydancer, I bought this not sure if it was performances or instructional. A good collection of ranged performances, I would say half inspired me visually, creatively, and made me want to work on a gothic inspired bellydance choreography. (Skirts and knifes! Soo cool!)The other half? Ugh. Neon is a good dancer but I've seen her in all her other videos and I can't take her seriously in this one -(she's the cute pretty blond caberet dancer). A few 'performance art/dance' pieces left me smacking my head... THIS IS WHY BELLYDANCE HAS A BAD REP IN SOME PLACES! A S&M; dance set? Come on!Anyway if you are needing to add to your bellydance video collection, buy it cheap or used."
1,what a waste,"I'm no goth; however, I am a very experienced belly dancer. I was under the impression that this was a darker, sexy approach to belly dance. I wish I had read reviews and spent more time researching this product because as I watch it now, I discovered that it's a cheesy celebration of the gothic pop culture insulting the art of belly dance. The effects were cheesy and the choreography took no thought nor talent; total waste of my time and money."
1,its Gothic... but hardly BellyDancing -- false advertisment,"I'm a fan of BellyDancing, and I know many Bellydancers and one of them is actually in this DVD. But here is the problem. I think they should have called it 'Gothic Interpiative Dancing"" or ""Gothic Fusion-Dancing"" ..Litterally only 2 out of all the dancers on this DVD actually BellyDanced..all the others were not. I was very disapionted, because I was expecting Bellydancing, not a half hour of a woman trapped in human sized peice of cloth trying to get out 'Cacoon / transformation' that is not Bellydancing, that is interpative dancing..completely different.Also, there is a very sleezy S&M; music video that has NOTHING to do with BellyDancing what so ever...what's up with that?I suggest find a friend who has it & watch it just for kicks (and maybe laughs), but don't waist your money."
2,Gothic Bellydance - Darker Side of Fusion,"Darker Side of Fusion was again, like I said for Revelations, not bad but not great. There were some dances that were entertaining, and the dancers did well, but the feel of the Dvd was lacking somehow. It just didn't give off that Gothic feel and some of the music didn't flow with the scenes. I'd say, if you could, rent this instead."
2,Dissapointment,"I was so excited to get this dvd. What a let down. The dancing, for the most part, was just not up to par. The S&M bit involved very little dance, mostly just wondering around the ""dungeon"" caressing various items, WHATEVER! My 2 stars go to some of the interesting costuming and concepts."
5,Medium Oak Ottoman with Black Pad,"Very well made real oak ottoman and is quite sturdy, I am very happy with the purchase of this ottoman and so is the recipient of the ottoman, my husband"
2,Land of Fog,"I must admit that I do not have an appreciation for this collection of atmospheric pieces. I'm not sure that means that it is necessarily bad. I will say, however, that among my peers, that I am usually the music snob. Maybe this is a case of getting something different than what I expected. I bought the LP Patruns about 35 years ago. Patruns is odd in its own right, but there was definitely something in that work that kept bringing me back. I expected that I might get similar feelings from Land of Mist. NOT. Land of Mist seems barely more than prolonged sound effects. So here is the real question, was the $.025 I paid a representation of true worth of this CD or is it simply a case of throwing a pearl before swine?I am not afraid to say I don't get it!"
3,The Director Should've Tackled Less,"The director should've tackled less and focused on directing & producing as opposed to adding acting to his ""roles."" The movie feels like it's moving in real time; a week in ""movie time"" equals two weeks in real time. Glad he was able to salvage his movie from a distributor who went bankrupt and then, put it ""out there."" Read at imdb.com. Congrats, Mr. Anthony."
4,"Ver comprehensive guide, but not for beginners","This book about Spanish grammar is very comprehensive, but I don't recommend it to beginners. This book is aimed at advanced students. The explanations are a bit technical, but the author provides ""real world"" examples on how each piece of grammar is used. When I say ""real wordl,"" I refer to the newspaper articles or the speeches the author cites.I especially like the chapter on the subjunctive. This book provides an entire chapter to it, very important. Although, I don't like how the information is organized.For beginning Spanish students, I don't recommend this book at all. It is too advanced. I recommend ""Side by Side English & Spanish Grammar."" I used it when I started studying Spanish, and it taught me a great deal of Spanish grammar.Brandon Simpson"
2,"Good Parts, but mostly bad","I just would like to add that the book was a real letdown for me. There were some really funny parts in the first half of the book, while the unit was in training but when the unit actually went into combat in Normandy the book really went down hill fast."
4,Great read,This book is a great account of a very special platoon. The subject is a real hero. Well documented and well written.
2,Forget it if you are looking for classic Santana,"I am not a jazz person, but I am a 50 year old head-banger that grew up on 70's rock.If you like the jazz-phase of Santana, then I cannot comment. However if you were looking for ""Evil Woman"", ""Oyo como va"", etc. then you won't find it here. This is not classic Santana. That's what I wanted but this DVD does not deliver that.Let me point anyone who has a nice hi-def setup and is into classic rock to Heart - Live in Seattle and The Eagles Farewell Tour #1, both 5 star HD productions...and the artists are true to their roots and are perfect and professional."
4,Santana one of the greats,"Ive own this movie for some time now, i still cant get enough of the sound and visuals in the dvd. and even though it is in HD it is still a very good format not a sound or visual is lost . the price is well worth it ."
4,as expected,Easy enough to use. Not as dark as I'd like but certainly dark enough. Instructions are easy to follow. The solution has no unpleasant odor.
2,Didn't work for me,"It may work on your hand but it did not work on my legs. I can't see the transfer working multiple times as the ink smears from the application fluid. Also, I thought I was buying stencils and not a stencil maker."
5,Extremely practical and useful,"I bought first edition of this book 7 years ago and have used it A LOT. I just bought the 2005 edition. I am interested in the nanometer CMOS design techniques and ""indirect compensation"" (how they are getting the ns settling times for the op-amps)."
1,Serious Security Flaw,"It is easy to overwrite a password protected file with another file of the same name. All you need to do is ""Save As"" under the name of the password protected file. It is easy to lose information either by accidently or through malicious activity. If security is a concern consider other programs on the market. I voiced my concerns on Lotus' website several weeks ago and no one has been able to find a solution to this problem. I wish Lotus would take a more proactive position to customer concerns.I am extremely disappointed in Lotus Organizer 6 lack of security. I am even more disappointed in how nonresponsive Lotus is to security concerns."
2,not so great,i liked their first one much better! now they made almost gospel! it cannot be right! you cannot play gospel metal! it doesn't exist!
2,zepplin vs. ozzy and gang,"Warpigs, Iron Man, and Parinoid are all great songs, but everything else ...!! With Zepplin everything brings down the houses of the holy. Fool in The Rain, Stairway to Heaven, and The Rain Song, and other greats take the cake!!!!!!! Too bad Sabbath. :(J&B; rEVEIWS"
2,SEMI GOOD,"Before I go on i'll tell you im not a big fan of black sabbath. I got this album for ironman warpigs and paranoid. ALL THE OTHER STUFF [lacks]THE SONGS IN ORDER LETTER GRADESWAR PIGS,A+ 'NUFF SAIDPARONOID,A- GOODPLANET CARAVAN,C-IRON MAN,A++++++++++ THERE BEST SONGELECTRIC FUNERAL,F- THIS SONG TO ME IS WRONG AND SICK TO EEEVVVILFOR MEHAND OF DOOM F LOOK ABOVERAT SALAD C-FARIES WEAR BOOTS C IT JUST DOESN'T APEAL TO MEWELL THATS WHAT I THINK FOLKS"
5,I was blown away.,"I bought this album from a friend about a year ago. I paid fifty cents. I got a thousand dollars worth of music. This is IT, the definitive metal album and the standard which all others should be judged by. Nothing has ever come remotely close.This is music the way it was meant to be played. From the opening notes of the masterpiece ""War Pigs"", to the anthemic crunch of ""Iron Man"", to the final moments of the hallucinogenic ""Fairies Wear Boots"", it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. As if you would want it to. I have never gone three days without listening to it. I don't think I can.If you like any hard music, from Nirvana to Ministry to Judas Priest, you will love this. Crank it up high, stare into a candle, and think ""This is where it all began."" Because it was. You might not be able to buy it for fifty cents, but this is the one that you have to buy. Pay any price. Because, no matter what, it'll be worth it."
4,Fathers of Heavy Metal,"So often Led Zeppelin are credited with starting heavy metal but I never understood that. I love Zep but they do much more acoustical, melodic stuff than Sabbath ever did. Plus their riffs were never as dirty and heavy either. The first 3 BS albums, in my opinion, define the beginning of heavy metal. They may not have the same depth and punch as say Pantera but that would probably be due to technology constraints of the time. Paranoid and Masters of Reality are 2 of my favorite heavy albums. Sabbath deserve the Fathers of Heavy Metal title exclusively."
1,Sabbith,"I picked this cd up and I was not happy with it. There are only 3 good song on the whole cd War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man. I wouldnt buy this. Buy Sabbith Bloody Sabbith its alot better then this."
5,The band that started it all,"First off to the guy that said this is posser metal, how in the hell can you call a band posser metal when their the ones that started metal. Don't be like some idiots that once said a few months back that Korn started metal. Now I respect Korn but come on they didn't even create nu metal. Man you need to get your history straight about how metal started. Anyway this is a good Black Sabbath album. Not as good as Bloody Sabbath but it's still a great album from one of the greatest bands of all time. Paranoid is one of the best songs from sabbath. Other good songs on the album is of course War Pigs and Iron Man. You don't have to like the band but you do have to respect the band for what they have done."
4,Black Sabbath Remembered,"Paranoid...is one of the first and one of the best Black Sabbath albums created. It was an original sound then, and still is to this day. Hard Rock doesn't come like this today. I enjoyed this cd just as well as the LP when it originally came out...A great piece of music...."
3,Warner Bros Paranoid about dimishing returns?,"First of all I am a huge huge Sabbath fan and have all original releases as well as tons of bootleg and rare audio and video. That said, I can understand why Iommi may have been less than thrilled about the release of this. I thought it would be thrilling to hear alternate versions of Planet Caravan and Paranoid. I suspect though that these were just place-holder lyrics. Scratch vocals. The lyrics on these versions are really sub par and I doubt Geezer had worked them yet. The quad mix I hear sounds muddy and not good. I don't hold Sabbath at fault at all for this. I just see it as one more example of how greedy record companies are. And it bothers me no one bit that they are suffering now from their own greed and stupidity. And they still don't get it."
3,DVD-audio or just DVD?,"Is the 'quadraphonic' disc DVD-Audio or just DVD?I say this as you need a specific DVD-audio player to hear it properly, asDVD-audio uses discreet PCM streams.DVD uses a digital stream, so the sound quality is different. If you playa DVD-audio mastered disc on DVD equipment no doubt it'll sound muffled and crap as they are different signals.Since DVD-audio is a dead format, like Quadraphonic, you would think the record company geniuses would release it as a standard DVD disc with a Dolby digital 5.1 or DTS mix like they did with the Nick Cave and Talking Heads remasters.Regardless there is a bootleg Quad DVD of 'Paranoid' in DTS format on the net, you wonder why the stupid record industry complains about bootlegging and going broke when their idiot staff can't even get formats and product right for the market. But i may be wrong, if this post get responses to confirm otherwise."
2,NOT SO GREAT AS PEOPLE KEEP TALKING!!,"GOsh!! PARANOID is really a bad album! It is ""sandwiched"" between BLACK SABBATH and MASTER OF REALITY, both of them wiht MUCH BETTER PRODUCTION. THat's right! PARANOID's sound is obnoxious, boring, a real pain to listen. Only the famous tracks are killers, the rest is some of the worst Sabbath (with Ozzy) ever wrote, obvioulsy due to the sheer speed this album was written and recorded, soon after their homonimous great (thi is really a a great album!) debut.PARANOID has so much fame due to it's title track. Nothing more than that."
2,Pretty good record,"Not bad for the old sabbath. Ozzy says his idols were the Beatles, too bad his band will never be regarded as greatly like the men from liverpool who changed the world. The Beatles still are the greatest thing to happen to music"
4,Sabbath's greatest,"The first truly awesome heavy metal album ever, Paranoid is from start to finish the greatest thing to ever come from what people today consider to be ""classic rock"" era, meaning AC/DC, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Purple..etc. The title track alone makes this worth purchasing but with songs like War Pigs and Iron Man in there also this is even more of an amazing album. And after you listen to this go and get Reign in Blood from Slayer, the greatest album of all time."
4,Excellent,"Well, I read all the reviews before buying. I can't give it a full 5 stars because, although quite beautiful and unique not to mention the beautiful main characters, It didn't touch me as deeply as some other shows. This could be because I was too caught up on the way it looks. I wasn't expecting the cinematography to be use playfully... I would have liked to see it done more traditionally, but i'm sure they're budget wouldn't have allowed 14 hour-long episodes to be filmed like movies. Oh well... No other complaints, intriguing, complex storyline."
3,Steve Peregrine Took-'The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus',"I give this Cleopatra label release a 3 1/2 star rating.For those of you that may not know,Steve Peregrine Took(R.I.P.)was Marc Bolan's right hand man when he first formed Tyrranosaurus Rex BEFORE the duo had split and Bolan had shortened the name to T.Rex.The two released three lp's from 1967-69.Took was said to be somewhat legendary with his drug use and the pranks that he pulled.'The Missing...' is a decent display of his solo recording effort.Took(played drums&bass)is said by some to have been like UK's reply to Iggy Pop.What drew me to this CD was Took's incredible cut of ""Scorpius""(Deep Space mix)on the 3-CD box 'Space Box 1970 And Beyond'(see my review).The tracks I liked best were the original mix of ""Scorpius"",""Luck Charm"" and ""Seventh Sign"".Second rate UK psych,but still a decent find."
2,dissapointing,just have to express that i had much higher expectations for this and am quite dissapointed. both of gilbert kaplan's M2s are preferable and i still find the Israel Phil/Mehta account to be my personal fav.
5,We just love this show!,"We got these two seasons because we have seen Season 1 & 2 over and over on Comedy Central in the UK and were desperate to know what happened after Casino Night! We were not disappointed - we watched both seasons in a matter of days, it was that great. Now all we can do is wait for Season 5 to be on DVD so we can see what happens after the fireworks die down. So exciting!"
4,Great show!,"My husband & I love this show! It is so funny, and the chemistry between all of the actors really makes the show worthwhile!"
1,Bogus Bionaire,"This little filter doesn't do a thing - and I am returning both units, which were purchased from HSN. Save your money as this is a noisy machine, even on low setting."
4,"A good product, better value buying the combo.","Why buy a wireless mouse and keyboard separately? Makes no sense, and Logitech offers this great solution. The product has tremendous range. I live in an apartment and can type in the living room and the receiver receives the info flawlessly. Walls don't seem to be a problem at all. It is great if you like to lay down while typing. I use it for copying reports that I hand write first and it is nice not to have to sit at the computer staring at the monitor.Drawbacks... well if you are a visual person like me, you need to look at the screen anyways and it is hard to type in a different room and not know what is going through or what errors you are making. As Office 2000 and Word 2000 gets better with its auto corrections, it will improve my comfort level with the remote abilities of this product. Also, the product uses batteries, which I am not entirely comfortable with, but it needs power from somewhere!"
3,Informative but not compelling,"What could be more interesting or filled with more fantastic characters, exotic places and famous clashes than the British Empire? This survery is generally informative, but it's not nearly as engossing as I had anticipated. It's true that attempting to write a one-volume account of the British Empire is daunting in the extreme, and James deserves credit for his attempt, but after closing the cover for the last time, I did so with more of a whimper than an enthusiastic bang."
5,Great DVD!!,Great DVD!! It gives you some great theoretical insight into street fighting. It is a good DVD to start martial arts or JKD.
4,Beth Hirsch - Early Days,"There seems to be a monopoly of electro-folk singer-songwriters named Beth, but I think Beth Hirsch and her album Early Days has the upper hand over her compatriot Beth Orton. For one, Hirsch's voice is stronger and her songs are achingly lovely. There's also a strong sense of melancholy on tracks like ""Come a Day"" and ""Gabrielle."" This album is certainly more acoustic than her work with Bang Bang or Air, but it showcases a different sensibility, one that isn't necessarily linked to electricity. Most of the tracks here speak of heartbreak, and they do so beautifully."
4,"Preludes, the stories before the chronicles.","As an avid Dragonlance reader, I found this book very insightful on Tanis's past. The prelude volumes are extrordinary reading and very fulfilling for those DL readers who first read the chronicles and wondered where Tanis, Flint, Sturm, Tas and the others originated. The preludes should be the next books to read after the chronicles. Besides, Tanis is awesome as always in this book."
2,kind of misleading,"This is nothing but a 2oz bottle of non-refillable rubbing alcohol that is squeezed through a plastic mesh.. for $6. You can get a whole liter for $1 and rub it on with a q-tip or cloth. $6 is a gross overcharge for this, this exact bottle, marketed as zit medication with salicylic acid, which is more expensive than rubbing alcohol, is still only $2.I thought it was gel for the electrode pads."
1,Unsatisfactory product,"Not only did this product NOT improve the conductivity of my stimulator, it actually neutralized the pads so that they would no longer stick to the skin, and resulting in having to order new pads."
2,Not good,Arrived on time but that's it. It did not stick well to the electrodes and it dried to quick. Not a good product.
3,Decent & inexpensive,"I have had the Quickcam for a while now, and while it is a decent camera, the quality could be a little better. The software is slow, which I would like to see improved. But for the money it is a lot of fun and an easy way to have your own Webcam running in a few minutes."
1,what about XP,"This camera is o.k. for quick snapshots, or a 5 second video for ""happy birthday"", but that's it. It is not compatible with Windows XP, even if you ""download"" the extra software from Logitech. I will cut the cord off mine and use it for driving practice at the golf course."
5,Judy at her best!,"This movie has everything going for it, great songs, good storyline, and likeable characters, and manages to keep you watching it all the way to the end. And I know this as I have watched it many times. And, as I'm a Judy Garland fan I think that this film is wonderful. Definately a MUST SEE film."
5,nice old movie,This was a nice family movie that we all enjoyed. Nice romantic story and good music. Also would be a good movie to watch at Christmas even though the title would make you think it is more a summer movie. Our five year old daughter also enjoyed the movie which is a plus for us.
4,Loses a star due to extras,"The most disappointing DVD in the Signature Collection.The included Chicago travelogues while curiosities tangentially worth including aren't worth trading off for in lieu of the missing deleted scene.Why didn't WB include Garland's version of ""Last Night When We Were Young,"" which was filmed but not used for this movie, on the DVD?We know they have it .We've seen it.If they are saving it for the That's Entertainment Trilogy, I would have bought it anyway.This ommision is not inadvertent and only created ill will."
4,Once again Judy's done it!,"As always a spectacular performance by Judy.I loved the acting, the singing was not a great as Judy's others like ""Meet Me in St.Louis"" or ""Easter Parade"" but I'm proud to be a fan of Judy.A lot like ""You've Got Mail,"" for people who loved that movie. Even at 13 y.o. I can recognize a true star,can't you!"
3,GARLAND`S BEST COMEDY ROLE,"This is not strictly a musical. It really is a comedy with s o m e songs included. In this film Judy Garland shows us a comic style not unlike the greatest ofèm all, JUDY HOLLIDAY (1922-1965) of ""Born Yesterday""(1950)-fame. The film is well crafted with great supports from Van Johnson, S.Z. Sakall, Spring Byington and Clinton Sundberg. Poor Buster Keaton is wated in this film. It`s great for the Christmas season."
1,I am just glad that I didn't buy it...,"I almost bought this book because I am interested in the topic. Fortunately, I checked the library and they happened to have a copy. Thank goodness for library cards! Honestly, is there anyone who has ever travelled with a kid who doesn't know to bring a ""boredom bag"" (a bag with crayons and puzzle books) for a long car trip? Want to know a great place to go with kids? Disney World. Who'd have thought?I am still looking for the recently published book that has some creative locations for family vacations. But unless you've been on the international space station since they invented the internet, this isn't it."
2,TOO ADVANCED!,"This book was the most confusing text I have ever read. The author jumps back and forth between infant weeks, months, and years which made it really confusing when trying to understand the order of milestones. The author expressed too many opinions and personal experiences. This made it difficult to understand the ""typical"" development of a child. I have seen other reviews explain that the book is very advanced; perhaps this is true because I am an undergraduate student. I may keep the book in case I need it later on, but overall, there has to be a more understandable book out there."
5,Language development,Excelent textbook. Super complete and super easy to understand... It was used but came in perfect conditions and it was here super fast..
5,Spaish Version,I like the reviews... im lookig for the spanish version. Does anyone know if amazon has it?
5,"A magnificent book, clearly a classic.",Lamm and Holls have hit a home run! This book will provide any car lover with many hours of informative and pleasurable reading.
4,Not truly cordless,"This is my second trackball. My first was a plug in. I love almost everything about it. However, when I ordered a cordless one, I assumed that was what I was getting. I was surprised to find a 4 ft. cord that plugs into my computer, which ""cordlessly"" connects to the trackball. I was expecting something along the lines of a memory card type plug in. I still love the trackball, and will always use one, but be careful what you assume."
3,Trackball Mouse,This product is Okay. I was expecting to get rid of the wires with the little USB plug. So in someway It's still like the corded version I own. Thanks anyway.Jeff
2,Old Stuff!,"The reception is not good, the base that you plug to the computer is as a big as a mouse so there is no space saving....wouldn't buy it again."
1,Huge disappointment (both product and Logitech customer service),"I'm really disappointed with both this product and the response I've rec'd from Logitech's customer service. If I could rate it lower than a one-star rating, I would.After purchasing this cordless trackman in December '09, it quit working in January '10. I contacted Logitech for a warranty replacement (January 25, 2010), and, as of Feb. 27th, I'm still waiting for a replacement. For some unknown reason, their customer service folks are unable to ship a replacement trackman. Today, I rec'd another email saying they were sorry and that they would ""reprocess"" my warranty replacement item. No explanation for their lack of shipping at all.This is the 2nd cordless trackman that we've owned. The first one also suddenly quit working - but, at least it lasted for more than 5 weeks!!What a huge disappointment from a company that used to be pretty good."
3,"Great fit, awful to clean","It fits my hand well and is very responsive to small movements, however the trackball collects gunk and is extremely difficult to clean. You can't simply pop out the trackball and wipe down the contact points; you need a screwdriver and at least a half hour of patience to put the pieces back together."
1,Logitech discriminates against lefties!!!,"I've recommended this product to right-handed customers and friends, but being left-handed myself I can't use it. I've called Logitech to see if/when they'd produce a left-handed version, but the representative I was dealing with basically just laughed in my face.Get a clue guys. Lefties might not a huge percentage of the market, but do you have any IDEA how much customer loyalty you'd get with marketing a product that's ergonomic for US?!?!?"
1,Trackballs are no good,"The Logitech Cordless Trackman Wheel has the following drawbacks, some of them endemic to all trackballs, some of them unique to this product:1. For _precision_ mouse movements (such as using AutoCad), using the trackman ball with your thumb is like balancing a plate on a pin--I would rather use a touchpad.2. At least in my office, the RF signal is ""line of sight"", so your receiver has to be within 2-3 feet of the device.3. Get an optical mouse instead; more accuracy.4. When the batteries run out, be prepared to navigate using your keyboard until you reinstall new batteries.5. Only advantage I can see is if you have very limited desktop space."
1,Logitech Cordless Track Man,It's great. Fits my hand perfectly and moving the track ball with my thumb is very easy. I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of moving their mouse all over the place
2,Blasts through batteries,"I love the comfort of this device, but it went through batteries like there was no tomorrow. I've stopped using it and I'm buying the same model in a corded version."
4,Excellent! If only I could switch the handedness..,"Otherwise I just love the track ball, but the only problem with it is that I can't change the handedness when I feel like 'exercising' my left hand. With my old mouse I got used to changing it from right to left every now and then but it's no longer possible with this one. :/"
5,"Great product, but need to get used to the button placement",would have prefered the buttons be farther apart but I'll get used to it.Great product.
5,Great option for long term use.,"I had the corded version of the mouse before, and it fit my hand just right. I could use it all day without fatigue. (The middle could be a little less arched, but it's not really worth complaining about). I use a 4000dpi corded laser mouse for more precise things like Photoshop, but sometimes I just want to lean back and put the keyboard on my lap, and the trackball on the arm of the chair and relax a bit. This is a great product provided it fits your hand comfortably, and I would suggest anyone try it. It's durable and well made, and comes with a 5 year warranty. Note that the reciever is rather large, and if you were using it on a laptop that might matter to you (I suppose). The large size might have something to do with the fact the mouse only takes a single AA battery that will last quite a while. Whatever the case, I like it a lot and recommend this cordless trackball."
5,great product,"This is my second purchase of the Trackman. After several years of use, my old one needed replacing. I like the feel of it in my hand and that I don't have to move my mouse around or pick it up to cover the full area of my monitor. I am so comfortable with this product, I admit I get aggravated when using a standard (AKA clumsy) mouse."
4,Cordless Trackman Wheel Review,"I think the Trackman is an excellent product & I much prefer it over the standard mouse. However, it is lacking one feature that I miss because I used it constantly on my Logitech Cordless Mouse. I has no back or forward buttons. With those buttons it would be perfect. If you ever design one with that feature, I will purchase it immediatley."
2,broken very easily,"I purchased this item about a year ago and now it starts to moving stiffly. I tried cleaning the inside, change the battery and update the driver, but still once or twice it suddenly moves very slowly and looses its track. Even the click button failed very often. It's very annoying when I was fliping webpages and editing documents. I have to switch back to my touchpad to drag it back."
5,The best is better,"I have been using the trackman wheel for what seems like forever and when I decided to streamline my computer system via wireless everything that I could, I was delighted that there was a wireless trackman. Had there not been one, my trackman wheel would have been my only wired connection because I would NEVER give up the wheel. It saved my shoulder from the damage the regular mouse was causing me. I definately recommend this product!"
4,My favorite mouse,"I used this identical mouse for several years before my three year-old got ahold of it and broke it. I could not find a replacement anywhere local, but found it here, at a good price. I prefer trackball and this one's cordless. One AA battery lasts a few months, and the range is very good, as long as the receiver is not on or near the CPU."
5,Much better than a mouse,"This trackball is a great replacement for a mouse. The thumb ball is easy to use, and the fit in the hand is excellent. I have been searching for a good replacement for a mouse since most of my laptop work isn't done at a table, and a mouse pad is awkward on your lap. The cordless aspects is icing on the cake. I do wish the receiver could be a bit smaller, but that is a minor gripe."
4,Usual Logitech quality,"I have never been disappointed in the quality of any Logitech product I have purchased. This trackball works well, rolls smooth, and has good range from the wireless receiver. At home, I can use it from across the room. At work, however, with more electronic interference, I have to be much closer to the receiver. The one caution is the scroll wheel - do not take out your frustration at the web on this part, it WILL break."
3,"Works OK, but is out of date","This wireless mouse uses a usb sending unit that is quite large for what it does. I discovered the hard way that the little lines on the usb receiver mean that the pointy end of the device needs to be aimed at the trackball mouse. I had it mounted with velcro to the back of my computer and it wouldn't work at all. I moved it to the side and it wouldn't work until I aimed it at the place on my desk where the trackball was located. Since then, no problems. I don't think it has enough range, so the new (blue) wireless trackball with the tiny usb dongle is going to be a big improvement. Hopefully it has more range. I wish I had waited a couple of months to purchase a wireless trackball mouse."
5,Great Ergonomic Device,"This is my 2nd one of these. I had the first one nearly 10 years and it was still going strong. The only reason I bought a new one was because the surface was all worn away from where my hand sits as I use it a lot and it was looking a bit grungy. I have arthritis in my hands, especially my thumbs and this is the only device I have found that doesn't hurt my hands when I use it. It is shaped so that my hand rests very comfortably on it and the cursor is moved with only the tiniest movement of the thumb on the track ball and I can scroll with just the lightest touch of my finger on the wheel. I love the fact that it is wireless and there are no wires getting in my way. After using this you will never want to go back to using a regular mouse again."
5,Excellent!,"The ergonomics of this trackball are excellent. Your palm rests on top of the mouse to operate the left and right mouse buttons, as well as the scroll wheel, and your thumb operates the trackball, just as God intended. Uses one AA battery, which will last a few weeks or longer with heavy use. It's optical, so no need to worry about dirt gunking up the works as with a mechanical trackball, and when cleaning is necessary, just pop out the ball and clean away. My only quibble is that the ball glides on three pieces of hard plastic, and these should be cleaned and wiped with oil if moving the ball gets to be more difficult than usual - or just eat some greasy chips while perusing the internet."
5,A Gamer's Must !,"Whether playing MMO's online or a standalone flight sim... the logitech trackman marble series is by far the best there is! The ability to do anything with a slight move of the thumb makes games where controll, timing, and speed much easier; and the cordless feature is an added bonus! I've never regretted using a trackman marble and keep a spare one around at all times."
1,What's with that price?,"When I bought my wireless Logitech trackball that looks just like this, a few years ago, I paid $75. The price on this one is absolutely nuts."
1,Piece of unreliable junk,Finally threw mine in the garbage. The wireless goes off and on continually - a constant battle of resetting and resetting. I LOVE this type of trackball and have never had a problem with the wired version which is what I went back to.
1,disappointing mouse!,I had the original with cord and I am glad I kept it when I received this cordless mouse. It worked good for about 20 minutes and then froze. Also within the fist 20 minutes that it did worked the range was not 6 feet. It was more like 12 inches.
5,Well spent $$,"Excellent video, covers almost all the features of the 2488. The host not only explains each function but shows the keystrokes and demonstrates how to record some guitar and vocals. If you are new to home recording there is even an introductory section titled ""Recording School"" which explains the basics of recording. I started recording on my 2488 immediately after watching this video. The visual demonstrations are like they say `Worth a thousand words'. I learned faster watching this video than I would have by reading the manual."
2,OK I guess...,"There are some parts that make sence, but other times it seems as if you were reading a story about a teenage girl going through normal teenage stuff. Not really a great book for young kids. High school only. Mentions drugs, drinking and a unusual sexual encounter. I don't recomend it, but read it if you must."
2,In Country Review,"This book was way too slow for my liking I'll tell you that right away. It also annoyed me how much detail she got into about the stupidest little things. Sam was so pariniod about everything in this book. It seemed as if every page she was worried Emmett had a new disease. That just basically ruined it and the book was in my opinion kinda of perverted. I don't think Tom's ""problem"" really had any signifigance in the story. No one cared how Lonnie and Tom played with Sam's breasts. I think it was perverted and just not nessary to put in."
5,Mason's Best,"Mason's first and most widely known novel, In Country is also her most evocative and enduring work. She captures not only the legacy of Vietnam for a daughter left behind, but also a small-town Kentucky life that's quickly slipping into the past.Perhaps the most nearly perfect representation of teenager caught between her hometown and popular American culture."
2,"In Country - Good Subject, half-baked novel","This novel took a good subject, good plotline, and good characters, and turned it into a lukewarm novel. Long, drawn out sequences strayed from the core of the novel, and made the reading tedious. The way the main character, Sam, acted made it hard to like her at all, which detracted from any enjoyment this novel may have provided at all. All in all, this novel could have been much better, had it been treated differently."
4,I like this tool,"I have been using this now for about 2 months. Sometimes when I open Amplitube 2, the sound is all distorted. I can usually fix this by changing the sampling rate on the setting menu and opening and closing the software again. There is something funky about the software. I'm still trying to figure this part out. You should have the recommended half gig to run the software. Once the sound is working, I have no complaints. The sound is really good thru the speakers on my computer and the supplied patches are great. It works great with my bass and guitar. I find the loop feature a big help to figure out how to play some of the licks in songs. Using the mouse to control the amp settings is also a little funky. I would buy this again if I had to do it all over. It's a very easy way to interface your guitar to your mp3 files and play along with them."
1,part received not as pictured or described,The item received was not as pictured - not white and not with a off/on button. The button changed the spray- but it is always on. So it is not as described or as pictured. It is a totally different hand held shower sprayer. Very disappointed and sorry I purchased it!!!
4,Chick kicks!!,"Chick was the best character in this book; an insightful, telling, sad, and extremely humorous portrayal of an oft-ignored part of our society. I found myself trying to ""sneak ahead"" to the next Chick chapter!"
3,Looks great but does not work for me.....,"Everything looks great with the AceriRhythm, except that it does not work for me.The distance between my pc (with the transmitor) and the stereo set (with the receiver) is only 10 to 12 ft (with a normal wall in between). However, the sound is highly distorted, even though I have re-tuned over and over, and the sound volume levels have been reset everywhere.I need a stronger signal..... Otherwise it is a great product."
1,Comment on this book,"I am completely dissapinted with this book. It is just a one-page introduction to every chapter plus little comments on two or three representative works of each period. Whether you have some knowledge or not on arts, the book is useless."
3,"Gorgeous shoe, terrible fit","I ordered these in a floral print after seeing them in a magazine, from Zappos. Paid about $100. I wear a 9.5m in most manufacturers, like 9 West, Franco sarto, Sesto Meucci, Unisa, and sometimes a 10 in some others...Stuart Weitzman, Cole Haan. When I got, I think in a size 10 in these, even those did not fit.Because the forefoot has this decoration that holds the shoe together at the front, it is very tight--there is no ""give"". The fabric itself is not leather, obviously, and it has no give.Even with a 10, this killed the forefront of my foot, which is a little on the wide side due to the fact that I have bunions. I could barely get them on...So, be cautious when ordering the correct size. Otherwise, a beautiful shoe, although probably not a walking shoe for anyone...this is a date shoe for when there is no walking!"
1,LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE!,"If you want your carpet to be soaking wet every morning, this is the unit for you! It seems to have a design flaw that allows too much water to run from the tank down into the lower humidifier section. The result is 1) no vapor, and 2) water all over the place. (I suppose the water in the carpet WILL eventually evaporate, and that IS a sort of humidification...)Read how many of the other reviews here talk about leakage - and decide how many days you want to waste trying to get this thing to not leak. I suspect you've got better ways to spend your time!"
4,"Cheap, easy to use mp3 player & jump drive",The sound quality is good. The battery life is good. It's great you can also use it as a jump drive. Only problem I have with it is that after listening to a song or two it shuts itself off unless you press pause or forward.
3,Received Broken,This is a beautiful set but unfortunately my palm tree was broken. Decided to keep it anyway.
5,Furnace is an all time modern Electronic Classic,"To this day Download in general has been a very influential group producing master pieces over the years. Furnace especially has a symbolic / nostalgic place for me. I still get inspired by listening to Furnace and it has to be one of the Best Download Albums. The Microscopic EP is also a masterpiece in its own right. both discs are a combination of experimental industrial noise and ambiance. Download among other experimental / electronic artists were very influential for me as fan, a musician, and now a fledging producer. And Download is it's own beast in contrast to Skinny Puppy, which I grew up listening to."
4,"Some great, some not so great","I would give 5 stars to Pride and Prejudice, The Scarlet Pimpernell, Emma, Victoria & Albert, and Jane Eyre. I didn't like Ivanhoe or Lorna Doone. I haven't watched Tom Jones yet. I got this set of movies for such a great price that I'm extremely pleased with this purchase."
4,A collection worth owning.,I waited for so long for this order to reach me....and it was really worth waiting for! A very nice collection of classic movies put together for viewing. Great movies with a great price. Thank you!!!!
5,An excellent guidepost for motivated senior IT managers.,"I rate this book 5 stars because it's the first text I've come across that accurately maps out the IS landscape (also known as IT or MIS or EDP). IS should always be about providing process automation - and that requires technical leadership. Most people in IS have forgotten that objective.Bob has done his homework and writes with a confidence born of experience, taking you through the phases of exploration, planning and tracking. I have especially enjoyed the chapter on decision making.Bob's writing style was interesting enough to hold my attention, though I could only handle a chapter at a time. Overall, an excellent reference work if you're an IS/IT manager looking to move up. It can help you build the skills and understandings for your next promotion."
5,Another good one from Robbins,"David Robbins has done it again. Scorched Earth is a book that I just could not put down. I recommened the book for my church book club and it was a hit with everyone. It is suspencful, action-packed and a love story of sorts. I truely enjoyed the book as did everyone in our book club. I promise you, you will not be disappointed with this book. It deals with love, racial prejudice, justice and the common good. Everyone should read this book. Then, you should read, War of the Rats, The Last Citedal, Broken Jewel and Betrayal Games. Robbins is a master story-teller."
3,"Good, but not great","This contains an interesting mix of fantastical elements and 19th century scientific beliefs, but it seems to drag on in certain sections--especially in the middle during the main character's pursuit of Foedora. Not up to par with Le pere Goriot or La fille aux yeux d'or, even if the final scene is nearing the delicious perversity of the latter."
2,"Not their best work, by a long shot...","Front Line Assembly has gone down in my book as one of the greatest techno-industrial groups out there. Not quite as hard hitting as KMFDM and NIN, they have a distinct sound which I have yet to hear another band duplicate. Unfortunately, Corroded Disorder does not reflect this. The Album is horribly repetative...it lacks the distorted vocals and ingenious use of clashing harmony which made Tactical Neural Implant and Hard Wired so fantastic. If you listen to the first 20 seconds of Corroded Disorder, you've just listened to the entire album. I was very disappointed in this release."
2,what's up with No Limit now.,I bought Mysticals last album and thought it was tight and I heard the first one which was good. This new one GhettoFabulous is just straight up garbage. Beats by the pound do bring in some tight songs time to time but there not coming up with any new material. Every No Limit record sounds the same. Mystical got some MAD skills but his beats are wack. Get his first or second album instead.
1,Nothin' but exploiting gangsta rap cliches,"A couple of decent tracks (Round out the Tank, Whacha want Whacha Need) aren't worth your money. Most of this record is lyrically idiotic and musically weak; nothing but an example of shameless pandering. Mystikal has an interesting style though, full of fire and loud and soulful. With some sophistication and a little non-existent integrity he might actually become an artist one day."
2,Mystikal represents all that No Limit has become!,"In thier early days, No Limit was one of the strongest labels in the game, now they are the Bad Boy Records of the south. Mystiakal's debut album was rocking, and it stayed TRU to the basis on which No Limit started, mad beats with a lyrical assault to back it up. This album, however, is just like the current No Limit, same beats, with repeating lyrics that are hard to understand. I would not reccomend this album, but instead reccomend that you pick up Mystikal's first album. P E A C E !"
3,No Limit Fabolous,"Mystikal is the only good rapper at no limit. Cuz snoopdog now, official *****. I like that song, ""That's the *****"". Mystikal should leave no limit before it is too late!"
5,This is the GREATEST No-Limit Record ever!! A Masterpiece!!,"No doubt, MYSTIKAL is the tightest soldier on the NO LIMIT TANK. This album is so tight I don't even know what to say. Hell, even if you don't listen to rap, you'll love this. His words flow together seamlessly and the beats will have your speakers exploding!! If you don't have this album, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!?! Get off your *** and get it TODAY!!! Str8 representin' dat dirty south!!!"
1,Not the item shown! Do not purchase!,The calculator they ship under this item number is not the view screen calculator. It is simply a TI-73 that can be purchased at this price in many places. I should have known that the price was too good to be true. I will not do business with this company again.
3,PERPLEXED,"I'M SIMPLY PERPLEX FOR THE FACT THAT ALL THE WOMEN IN THE BEDWYN SERIES FIND IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEIR LEGS CLOSED, OMG, WHY, WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT? I'M NOT PURITAN BUT ALL, ALL, ALL OF THEM SO FAR PRACTICALLY FORCE THE MEN TO TAKE THEM, THE THING IS THAT THE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESPECTFUL WELL MANERED LADIES, BUT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY BUM!!! THEIR SKIRTS ARE IN THEIR WAIST AND THEIR LEG OPEN. I PERSONALLY FIND THIS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTING. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT GIVES ANYTHING EXTRA TO THE STORY. ALLEYNE STORY IS MUCH BETTER THAN MORGAN'S, I LAUGH AND CRY. I LIKED IT MUCH MORE."
3,Nice...,I thought that this book was ok b/c well I don't like what all happens in this book. Yeah there are some great parts but it doesn't have the WOW factor. It isn't all that memorable to me. Out of all the Slightly series this is one os one of my least favorites.
2,Of a different vein than Wheeler's historical novels,"I can say now that I vastly prefer the author's historical works. I just didn't appreciate being lectured to for 400 pages. Everyone in this book is stubborn, drunk on personal belief, and mostly unlikable, a trait seen in many of Wheeler's antagonists, making it that much harder to stomach."
1,Chewed it up,Our Miniature Dachshund chewed up the ends of it. He ruined it. Had to take it away from him...I was very dissappointed as that was a more costly toy.
2,Not that good....,"The pictures in the book are very nice, color photographs. However, there is little organization to the photo section. For example, in the beech family photo plates you will see several oaks listed....I dont know why.The range maps are totally useless.I am a biologist so I am familiar with the terms and information in the descriptions, but I can see the confusion or need for a supplementary field guide for non-scientists."
5,A One Line Review of The Far Country,"Andrew Peterson pulls of a stunningly beautiful album, layered with exceptional instrumentation and lyrics that chase after themes of love and loss, life and death, and the hope of heaven...the results are absolutely moving."
5,great,"I loved this book, Valerie King does not disappoint. great chemistry between the characters and very well written."
3,An alright Debut Album,"Switchblade Symphony through thier short career found themselves in a alot of peoples ideal music collections. Often critical reviwers find it fairly easy to develop a real likeing for them(much more so thier later albums). This first SS album shows a more decadent and goth sound then thier later two and may not win favor with a wider audience then goths. Still as in thier later albums they keep thier songs diverse from eachother never giving fans a predictable or boring sound.I'd recommend thier late two: ""Bread and Jam for Frances"" and ""Three Calamities"" both before I'd recommend this being that it doesn't at all have the dynamics and dub, trip-hop sound that the later two explore with a sound outside of any single genre. All in all this album is still ok."
5,This kicks [body]!!!,"(...) kickin' rockin' wild blues. Man this Piazza dude plays harp(harmonica) like a wild maniac, with toooo much talent!!! WOW, and his lady Honey Piazza palys piano with power and loads of boogie woogie honky tonkin' Jerry Lee Lewis-Champion Jack Dupree wildness and pure pounding power!!! This band is like a vitemin pill, full of pep and energy, and zaniness, in the best possible way. This band is tight, and Rod's vocals are right out of 1954! The bands sound is authenticly 50's sounding, yet they are fresh and play a lot of originals, that sound like they were written in 1954! Awesome band, and sheer terrific jump blues that truly rock!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Not bad, Not bad","There's no doubting that this review book contains everything you could ever need to know to get a 5. The practice tests well represent the AP, and the practice questions after each chapter are very useful. However, organization is very important in a review book, because we tend to compartmentalize information. Unfortunately, organization this book lacks. Coupled with your notes taken from your class textbook, the book should work like a charm."
2,d-pad breaks,This and other saitek pads like the p220 and p2500are fine except the d-pad falls off after a monthof usage. I hear that you can call saitek to geta replacement but cant confirm and who wants thehassle of shipping the pad for repair. Avoid unlessyou desire paying $20 every month.
1,Buyers beware.,"You cannot uninstall the drivers that come with this. They have no uninstall utility, so if you ever want them off of your computer, or if they messed up your computer (like they did mine), then you're out of luck.I contacted saitek support about the issue, but got no response."
3,extra plug,I wanted to give my phone dock a built in look but not having a visible phone charger cord so I but this in the dash and then plunged my charger into it. problem I had was the door/cover but it came off easily and the second was my phone charger was not being held tightly but a piece of electronic take fixed that.it was very easy to install I used quick splices from auto zone I have been using this for the last month with no problems.
1,not standard headphone,The headphone was broken really quickly and it couldn't use any standard headphone. So the mp3 player became a trash!
1,Cheap piece of crap,Doesn't work unless it's plugged into the computer. Buttons don't work. Four-way button is loose in the socket and feels like it could fall out any second. Headphone jack only plugs halfway into the port. I feel like they built this thing for around 98 cents. Completely worthless. Maybe the one they sent me is defective.
2,Hard to believe,"These boots seemed sooo well made - thick sutrdy, the handles well-connected.So now - 2 years of occasional wear by a youngster - the black rubber laminate (over fabric) is flapping in the wind - just torn completely. Otherwise, they are in great condition, but such a shame. I would NOT re-order these boots - cannot return/exchange after 2 years, even if only occasional wearing.He LOVED these boots - we invested in the hat and coat as well.=:-((The ""seam"" - connection between t he yellow toe and black, seems to bear the brunt of any pressure from movement - both boots the same - and maybe the rubber flexing only against thin cloth is more prone to tearing?? That's my non-engineering guess.Very disappointing. . . ."
2,I had such high hopes and am left with mixed opinions,First these are not the first pair of this exact boots that I have owned. My five year old son had the same pair in a smaller size that we purchased from Nordstrom last year. He didn't wear them enough to judge back then because they were grown out of quickly. I purchased this pair in December and have not had good luck. The 2nd time he put them on the handles you grip to pull them on broke off on both boots. After wearing them for about a month the sole started pulling apart and ripping. I'm not impressed. I will tell you that my 5 yr old son is extremely high spirited so perhaps they wore out quicker than normal. Not sure but I won't be buying these next year.
2,Worn to death in 6 months.,"Ok, my son wore them to death.He also got the ""Jr. Fire Fighter Suit with helmet"". That was a creat buy and 3 year of almost daily useage is still ok.The boot start falling apart at the seams."
1,Save your money,"I was sorely disappointed in these rainboots. My little fella loves all things firehouse-related and was thrilled when he saw them under the Christmas tree. I expected that for the money paid, they would be well-made and last a good long time. Within a few monthes they were splitting across the tops of the boots. He still wants to wear them but they are of course, not waterproof now. I had purchased a pair of rain boots for my daughter from Old Navy and they survived without damage for years. I will not purchase Western Chief rain boots again."
1,Fire boots,"My sons totally loved these boots the only problem is they ripped apart at the toes and the sides of the front of the boot. We tried fixing them but, it didn't hold and the boots had to be trashed. This was very upsetting due to the cost and the disappointment to my boys. I am looking for other boots to purchase that will hold up to the everyday wear and tear of boys."
1,"Cute, not durable","These boots just don't last. In less than a month of light use, the upper portion had separated from the sole on one of the boots. I would be very reluctant to buy another of these."
1,These boots fell apart,These boots fell apart after very little wearing. They came apart at the seams. I would NOT recommend them. Very disappointing to us.
5,We've worn out 2 of these CD's already!,"My 6 year old listened to this every night for over a year...it is beautiful, soothing and comforting and there is nothing to jar a child who is falling asleep. I hear him humming to it after I shut his door, and then he just drops off to sleep. It's great, and I'm buying my third copy!"
4,Overall A Good Book,"Overall I felt that this was a good book. However, I not did feel the need to stay up all night turning the pages. I was easily able to put it down. I felt that the story moved at too slow a pace.I wished that there had been more development to the Sandy character and I would have liked to have known more about Dashay's mother. It was hard for me to beleive that a mother could leave her baby like that. I know it happens, but it's hard to beleive. More development as to why that happened would have made me happy.I cried at the end when Isaac proposed to Bebe. I was very happy that things had worked out for them.I did believe in the characters. Ms. Joe was able to make me feel like these characters were people that I knew. Ms. Joe had the ability to make the characters real. I feel that that is the most important thing an author can do. As I said, I felt that overall the book was a good read. I look forward to reading future projects by Ms. Joe."
2,"Great Idea, Little Action","The idea behind this product is terrific, but the execution needs much improvement. I found that the accuracy was much less than advertised, and the pen required considerable testing to get at the proper angle to scan material. The system for selecting a function for the pen is confusing and requires several hours to master. This item needs much refinement before it deserves major marketing. It remains more of a toy than a tool."
1,Not compatible with Linux or MacOS,"I didn't see this anywhere in any of the other reviews, but this Pen isn't compatible with MacOSX or Linux. This is unfortunate since it'd make a great companion to my PowerBook G4 otherwise."
5,Don't Get Lost in the Sales Cycle,"It would be great if you could develop some new technique for walking into a large corporation and closing a major sale on the first visit, but it rarely, if ever, happens. Chances are, you're in for drawn-out process with lots of players. Most corporate sales professionals meander through this process hoping to ""do what it takes"" to close the sale. Miller, Heiman finally offer up a way of keeping score -- of knowing where you stand in the process and what you have to do to keep it moving in the right direction.By developing a standard nomenclature to discuss buy types and their relevant position in the sales process, Miller, Heiman allow you to keep track for yourself, but discuss it with your sales management. This is likely the most important book about the strategic side of selling.I can guarantee you this: read this book -- practice the technicques within, and you will never find out you lost a sale after the fact."
1,not very original,"I wouldn't compare Pygmy Children with the great Skinny Puppy or even FLA. Skinny Puppy created a style of their own, obviously with influences but handling them in order to create something: a) new b) good FLA is not that original but also good. Pygmy Children is, like many other bands, not able to create their own style but instead follow another bands's style stmes to the extent of copying. Some of them, however, make it good anyway: Mentallo and the Fixer, for example. But Pygmy Children is, IMHO, a band lacking interesting ideas; ok they have at hand good electronic devices and so their sound is magnificent; but they don't add any interestng thing FLA has not made before. If you have all Puppy, 242 or FLA records, then I would recommend you to listen to C-TEC or even OHGR; they're much better than Pygmy Children."
4,Looks good on your table,"These little forks are sturdy and look good when you are serving anything. I use thermoforming cheese and crackers, antipasto all throes of things and everyone comments on how nice they are"
5,"Building Trust in Business, Politics, Relationships and Life","Dr. Flores has written much on the subject of trust, and I have been reading his words for many years. This book is his MOST readable. And so for that reason, it is probably his most important to date. The readability may or may not be a result of teaming up with Dr. Solomon, but irregardless, buy this book. Everyone of us has had setbacks we could call trust issues. So why is it we don't read more on the topic? Is it so sensitive an issue it can not even be approached? I hope not. Even the approaching will illuminate troubled areas of our lives. And there is plenty more to be discovered here. We can not avoid trust, so here are some practical ways to help the common person think about trust philosophically. A whole new concept: a philosophy book you can read and discuss with your children!"
5,"Wonderful Aroma, Excellent Lather","Bought this for my hubby; it creates a smooth, creamy lather and smells slightly of Tabac (my ALL TIME FAVORITE aftershave, which he also wears). The soap is long-lasting and looks like it will last for at least a year of daily shaving use.You also really owe it to yourself to try Tabac's men's aftershaveTabac Original By Maurer & Wirtz For Men. Aftershave 10.1 Oz.Tabac has a classic, manly smell that's quite unique and, what can I say, very German. It reminds me of a sumptuous mahogany library filled with leather bound books, with a slightly woody aroma. Love it!"
5,"Great soap, Great Lather",Love this soap.It is super easy to use to create lather. This is a shave soap not a cream so you must have a shave brush in order to create and apply the lather. If you want a cheap starter brush I recommend starting with something like thisTweezerman Men's Shaving Brush. Tabac helps moisturize my skin and prevents irritation. The lather is perfect for a smooth shave.I really enjoy the smell and so does my wife though I have heard some people state they don't like it as much as others. To me it just smells like soap is supposed to smell.This puck will last you quite a while (longer than any canned goo)Highly recommend for anyone wanting to try something different in their shave routine.
5,Top of the short list,If I were on a desert island and only allowed 10 CDs this would be on my list. I don't even consider myself a huge Soft Cell fan. This recording has stood the test of time. I've had this for about 15 years and it still sounds fresh everytime I hear it.
2,Wow nasty,"I recently got a puppy from a shelter. They insisted on this food and gave me a free bag. Its terrible! My puppy is 5 months and It makes her get the ""runs"" and the worst farts you can imagine! I can't even finish out the bag...and its FREE!! I even went as far as putting her on a chicken and rice diet and gradually putting her on this food and she still can't handle it."
1,Waste of money,This product is garbage- it looks and feels like a cut up pair of pantyhose with no support or shaping provided despite claims otherwise. I perhaps should have ordered a smaller size but following their sizing chart I ordered correctly. What a waste of money! Do not buy this product- go buy a pair of cheap control top pantyhose for under $5 and save your money. Notice this company does not even stand behind its products by allowing returns for new un-used products. RIPOFF!!!!
4,"Great Shape, can't live without them","I had a great loss of weight in the last 2 years, and this one, and the long ones had helped me a lot in my shape... I can't live without them... you just have to buy the right one for your size, if you buy it too little you will pay the consecuences... Just try to be honest with your size and you will have the good shape you want... I'm using an XS right now. It is great... I wear them under my bra. I bought two, because I wear them everyday... you have to replace them maybe in 6 months, in some cases I've had to sew them."
5,Real insight into the new Thunderbird,"I ordered my 2002 Thunderbird months ago, long before any hit the streets, and long before there were any showroom models to sit inside of or take for a test drive.This book gave me a chance to know this car from the inside out. There are countless photos of the car (inside and out), in addition to technical descriptions and diagrams of the components. You even get to see a T-Bird assembled step by step. It's a fascinating book..."
1,Not worth the money or your life,Simple review: Falls apart or breaks depending on how you would like to describe it. It would probably be safer to put a fish bowl on your head.
2,Knockoff,"Shipping took FOREVER. Total disappointment when it did finally arrive... Box (packaging) looks nothing like what it was online, no paperwork, certificates etc. There was also no Bulova cloth sponge inside holding the watch. Just some cheap looking black one. The watch itself does resemble what is pictured but screams knockoff from every other aspect.... SOLD BY AMAZON"
4,"A fun, quick read, great for a snowy weekend","Have you ever been so terribly upset that you did something absolutely stupid and crazy, but it turned out to be the best thing you could have done? Well, not me, either. But Teresa DiRosa does in Feeding Christine. Imagine facing Christmas without your college age son, who has chosen to spend the holidays with your ex-husband; imagine that around this time of year your beloved sister killed herself years ago; imagine that you have just discovered her daughter, your darling niece Christine, with a gun and the intent to kill herself. What would you do? If you can accept what Teresa does, you will laugh and love this book. It will give your heart wings and feed your soul. ANDDDD....you'll have a big craving for Italian food when it's done. Buon Giorno!"
4,Very unique and interesting!,"""Feeding Christine"" was very different than my normal book picks. I found it kind of hard to follow and identify with the characters. Theresa was the hardest nut to crack. Christine wasn't all that unstable as they made her out to be. She just needed to get away from James and live her own life. This book was good..don't get me wrong...but it was hard for me to follow."
5,Saitek P990,"delivered on time , and the pad works perfect , i love it because it has 12 buttons ,so for fps you can configure a lot with this one ,,,,"
1,Very disapointed with Amazon,"Only plays AVI files. The SMI and SRT subs is a BIG lie. I have not receive any carrying case, hand strap and remote control. And now Amazon replys: Contact seller. And seller (J&R Music) says: It's an error of Amazon's web page"
3,Does the job,"This media player is good for the price. I just dont understand why they dont make it so it can pass forward, you can bacically only play, pause and stop."
1,"Product ok, not manufacturer!","After receiving it, I was billed again by the manufacturer! I wouldn't buy anything from them again."
2,What a waste of money!!!,"Had these for about 2 years, didn't even wear them once. They're very uncomfortable. Cute but extremely uncomfortable. I finally donated them to Salvation Army."
3,Nice but....,I returned the item. Very attractive but thicker and heavier than I would prefer. The watches should show their thickness in the discriptions.
1,Poorly written and badly structured.,"Jumbled and poorly structured. Parker is an academic, and yet he doesn't know what a 'premise' is. Read Alexander MacKendrick's On Filmmaking for all you need to know on screenwriting; and it's written by a filmmaker."
5,Great Printer,"I gave this printer as a gift and it was a big success! This canon printer has lot's of great features as one can tell by the review, however, what makes it so wonderful is it's simplicity! However, be aware that 6AVE company does not provide additional boxing for it's shipping! 6AVE was quick and efficient BUT, this cannon printer arrived on my front door step in it's orginal packaging just like you would fine on any store shelf. I was amazed and GRATEFUL that it arrived intact and hadn't sprouted legs along the way!"
4,Great all around printer,"I recently purchased this printer to use or documents as well as photos. The performance is outstanding! Photos print at an amazing speed with near photo lab quality. But it DOES guzzle ink and replacements are somewhat pricey. I especially like that you can not only monitor your ink usage on screen, but it also will notify you of low levels before it runs out. I am very pleased overall with iP4300."
1,Not Satisfied,Does not print. I have gone through all the trouble shooting and nothing works.Error message indicates may need servicing.I will be returning it and get my money back.
4,Bosnian Noir?,Three soldiers that murder a Serbian neighbor feel the noose tightening. The narrative structure here is to cherry pick certain scenes until we guess what's happened and then replay a few of those scenes with an added minute of dialogue that reveals the missing motives and schemes. Effective at showing what a moral black hole these soldiers lived through.
4,Buy this cd because its great!,"I was so happy the day i got this cd in the mail. It was a bit of a dissappointment because not all the songs were as good as their song of all desperations, but if you listen to it. it will grow on you like a fungus in a gym shower. Some songs are slow and boring, but songs like Saraband, the shelter, patient, and sufftagette city (a david bowie song) make up for it. This cd will have you hissing like dracula in no time! By: Deathly Death"
4,Dance like crazy!,"This was Soft Cells' second album, is a very fresh and danceable one. It gets us all back to the 80's. It's astounding what a great quality and creativity this two guys were able to cook up just using a couple of synthesizers. Of course Almond is a vocal talent and Ball a great musician. I strongly recommend it to people over 35 yo."
5,Great product!,"This product is a wonderful cleansing bar. Cleanses using natural, gentle ingredients and doesn't over-dry skin. I found this product helps my face look more youthful and also helps with occasional breakouts!I love this cleansing bar! I definitely recommend it!"
1,What happened to Buck-O-Nine?,This album is complete trash. It sounds exactly like their old stuff minus all the good parts. This CD is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever bought. Save your money or pick up Barfly.
4,"Internet Cool Guide is an Insightful, Critical, Great read","I spend a lot of time online, and trying to find decent Web pages with a search engine is a shot in the dark. This book is great because it does all the work for you--it's so much easier to look in the index for a good banking site than to use Yahoo!. And it shows stuff on the Web you didn't even know was there to look for in the first place. I'm getting this for everyone for Christmas!"
5,The awesome Bionicle book that I ever had,It gives you alot of information about Rahi. There may be some creatures that are familiar and some that are new to you.
4,Track listing...,"This is only a 2 track cd single, not a full cd...Track listing...1) Hold On To Your Friends2) Moonriver (Extended Version)"
1,All Pictures No Substance,"I tried a few recipes from this (yes beautiful but) useless cookbook. They all turned out horribly. I tried one recipe for noodles with lamb kofta and it called for three tablespoons of red curry paste. I'd never used red curry paste before so it was partially my fault but when I tried the kofta, my tongue almost burned off. I love spicy food, but this was an obvious mistake. And unfortunately, this cookbook is FULL of them."
1,louzy waste of time,"I have no idea how any body can give this book a good review. The book is made out to be a bio of John Pershing but in the 331 pages of this book you couldent fill 25 with information directly about Pershing. This book is mostly a history of the times Persing lives with little about the man himself. The book is redundent booring long winded and when I had finished it I found I knew little more of ""Black Jack"" than I could have gotten from a Wikipedia artical. Dont incorage writing like this by buying this book."
1,Crappy counterfeit balls,"These balls are not legal for tournament or even good for practice use. They are NOT 3 star balls, they are crappy counterfeit. Don't waste your money at all on this. They should be sold in a dollar store, not here for this price. Totally wasting my time and money on this. I wish I could have given them negative 5 stars."
1,poor quality balls,"These are the worst balls I have ever bought, I do not think this is the 3 Star quality ball. I could not use them even for practice. I will never buy these balls again."
2,NOT FOR ENGINEERS !!!,"If you are an engineer on the field, you already had general ideas about these programming languages, so this book is a joke! DON'T WASTE MONEY ON IT ! You need more specific books. This book is best for 2nd-year engineering students, or general readers who are CURIOUS about software development, it will satify your curiosity, but it will not take you anywhere ! The book title ""...For ENGINEERS"" stinks because engineers need much deeper book than that, they need 'real food', not just a 'smell' of foods which may [make them upset]!!!I gave '1 star' for the book title ""...ENGINEERS"" and '3 stars' for general readers, so my rating is 2 stars."
5,Awesome Coils!,"I put them in a 2000 s10 2.2. Idles better, takeoff is better, installation is a breeze (5.5mm socket). Best hundred bucks i ever spent!"
3,a culty sounding album,"Psychic TV's Force the Hand of Chance is an interesting mix of pop and experimental music. I think the album gets better as it goes along. A few listeners may find some of the lyrics unintentionally silly; however, the album definitely sounds different and a few tracks are even memorable. The two best albums to get from Psychic TV--that are also still available-- are Dreams Less Sweet (a classic!) and Hex Sex--The Singles (excellent pop music and much more)."
2,Book misses a complete chapter,"For a textbook advertized as ""used-good"" I find it acceptable that it has highlighted parts by previous user. However, I find it unacceptable that a complete chapter in the middle of the book is missing (cut out). Resellers should check books more effectively and notify potential buyers (""some parts missing"") and substantially lower the price for an incomplete book."
1,"awful, teachers please do not use!","This is the worst textbook I've ever had to use!! The layout is awful, poor examples, everything about it is awful. You can't even find any definitions or terms. If any definitions are given they are at the end of the section and don't expect them to be bold like most textbooks. The actual text is very dense and is organized poorly. Professors, please don't make your students use this textbook. The won't enjoy the class or get anything out of it."
1,Measurement and Assessment in Teaching (10th Edition),This book is missed printed. As you move into Chapter 5 the Chapter title on the top of the pasges read Chapter 4.
4,Diving Vancouver Island,Good amount of detail. Every dive site has a map which makes it easier to dive as comapred to useing the others (99 Dives).Over 50 Dive Sites for the South end os the island
4,Psychic TV - 'Trip Reset' (Cleopatra),"Wasn't this their comeback effort after a lengthy absence?Never been all that of a 'big' Psychic TV fan,but I would like to see them tour the states again sometime.'Trip Reset' is a good return for frontman Genesis P-Orridge and crew.Real tough to describe their sound,try industrial experimental.Tunes I thought were nice to check out were ""Mother Jack"",their decent cover of Pink Floyd's ""Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun"",""White Sky"" and ""Star To Far(Lullaby For Sid)"".Might appeal to fans of Controlled Bleeding,Meat Beat Manifesto,Nurse With Wound and possibly My Life With The Thril Kill Kult."
4,Great for an aspiring writer,"I used this for a class in creative writing. Anytime I got writers block I would read a few of the stories in Sudden Fiction. It didn't always help but all the stories are highly entertaining and from time to time the stories inspired me to pen up my own experiences in their voice or mine. All in all, whether you're using it seriously or not, you'll enjoy this book's short stories. There's a wide variety for all moods and writing styles. It'd be hard not to like at least some of the stories and if you're a writing student or pro I'd think this type of material would be essential for those lean times."
5,The best thing ever,"This is one funny manga. Especially this first volume. I really could not stop laughing. It's also so addicting, one of those books you can't put down till the end, and even when it's over you read it again and again.The art is also very noteworthy. It is absolutely gorgeous. The character designs are some of the best I've ever seen. It's one of those mangas where the guys are drawn really good. I mean they literally make you drool.Ahhh I love this series so much. I recommend it for anyone who likes a good story. What is the story about? Basically a misunderstood highschool girl (momo) that everyone assumes is a easy party girl because of her looks. She likes a guy named Toji and a guy named Kiley likes her. Then there's her ""friend"" Sae who wants whatever Momo wants, Momo wants Toji so Sae wants Toji.( But where does poor Kiley fit in). So it basically sets off from there. Read and enjoy."
2,I was not impressed with Peach Girl at all...,"This is one of the most beautifully done manga I've seen, but that is all it has going for it in my eyes. The characters are shallow and superficial. The plot is unoriginal, and I felt as though I wanted to slit my wrists after reading some of the episodes. Not for those who feel for another person."
2,Disappointed and misled,"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday. I looked around at a lot of ride ons and chose this one because of the educational value. However, it only teaches the letters a-d and is VERY loud. Additionally, the stickers started coming off within a week. On a positive note, it is sturdy as far as toys go and my daughter loves the music."
3,Rand McNally 2005 Northern Colorado Street Guide,Not up to date - but then at the rate northern Colorado is being the developed the new one will be out of date before it is printed .OTOH it gets me where I need to go.
2,psu,well let me say it this way mine went bad shortly after i got it but was so cheap i didnt even try to warranty it lol but went for the xion 1058watt psu instead to replace it after the failure
3,"Not the best Nico compilation, but still Nico","If you are going to buy a Nico compilation, I would suggest buying 'The Classic Years' instead, as it has a better overall selection of her songs. If you are going to buy your first Nico album, I would suggest The Marble Index or Desertshore instead (and if you have those, pick up everything/anything else of hers produced by John Cale). I wouldn't really suggest this heartily, but then again, I wouldn't tell you to NOT buy it, because it's still Nico."
1,Buyer beware!,"While both of the movies in this DVD collection are terrific, classic comedies, these DVDs have such poor sound that it is extremely hard to catch all of the witty diaglogue and great performances. Do not buy this edition! The sound goes in and out, the visual quality is poor, and there is a reason that both of these movies are offered for so cheap a price. I strongly recommend seeing both of these movies, but spend more money for a DVD that you can actually watch!"
2,disappointing,"A good start with a promising plot but, like a previous reviewer said, a very predictable end. Weak characters with 'watered-down' emotions. I found myself jumping paragraphs and struggled to finish it."
4,The first A. Q. book I ever read.,This is the one that got me stared with A. Q. and now Amanda Quick is one of my favorite authors.
3,an icon still white,"The very slant of this book is it's only problem. It more than hints that Mae West's entire career and even her actual race was attributed to African American origin. Having read every book ever written on Mae West, I will say this one offers a few new and interesting tidbits and some good photos. But clearly Mae West was not black, and her ""black roots"" stemmed from nothing more than a love of blues music, a few black lovers and respect for the African American community when it was not considered the thing to do. Still it is an interesting read, if you can overlook the desperate attempts to make racial connections to even the most minor situations in West's life, music and films."
2,Not What It's Cracked Up To Be,"I have read a lot of Mae West books. Obviously, that means I am a Mae West fan--and a big one. I found this book difficult to read, what I mean is-difficult to finish. It is boring, long-winded and the author seems to feel Mae had black roots. This is the writer's whole theme, and it is just groundless. On and on and on...enough already. This bio of Mae adds nothing to earlier works."
3,Nice design but very heavy,"I bought this as a gift for my fiancé, as he loved to mix drinks. Overall I think it is pretty as a piece of decor, but less practical for actual cocktail-mixing. The item is fairly heavy, and gets very, very cold when you mix a drink with ice."
5,"Relaxing, rejuvinating and meditative","Both my husband and I love this DVD. There are 2 level options (A + B) and three time options within each level. It's been a great way to both vary the workout and fit it in no matter what.I find that it has a nice balance of relaxation and meditation, with a moderate workout. There is a great section of the DVD which focuses on the specific poses. This has helped to improve my practice greatly.The instruction is clear, easy to follow, and uplifting. I strongly recommend this DVD for beginners, anyone overcoming injuries, or those just looking for a gentle yoga practice."
3,Easy but no diversity in routines,"The dvd is really good and I would recommend it. However, even though there are 6 routines, they are all pretty much the same routine with small additions with increasing time. I was just expecting more diverse routines I could choose from."
2,1 of: Yoga: Gentle Vinyasa Flow (Used - Very Good),"Vinyasa flow to fast in it.I do like long stretch,and with this DVD I have no Good stretch at all!!!So fast all the way,this DVD!!!! :("
1,Horrible,"This was horrible! I was so excited to see some of the greats! Holy smokes, i didnt realize the geriatrics Were performing! Spend yor your money on somthing else, this sucks!"
1,There are many other better costume jewelry reference books,Pictures and selected jewelry are average. Price guide is inflated and unrealistic. Text adds nothing new to information already available in other books.
5,I think the book is beautiful!,"I am trying to get the email address of the author, Fred Rezazadeh. Is this possible?"
2,A Poorly Designed Grill Cover and Some Fantastic Weber Service,"In June I ordered a cover for my S 420 Grill. I looked great, fitted well and I was very satisfied until the first rain storm. The cover, which was designed with a mesh vent on the back fed water into the drip pan of my grill, filled the grease pan to overflowing and wet & greased the entire inside of the lower cabinet. I called Weber's help line and a nice lady confirmed my original purchase then said she would ship a redesigned cover to me. Within twenty hours Fed Ex arrived with a new redesigned and suitable cover at no charge. Service like that makes Weber a great company.Nels TyringStratham, NH"
4,Weber Summit cover fits like a glove,Fits perfectly on our Weber Summit 450 and looks like it may last a few years as well.
5,Best Show Ever,"This series was so much more than a great crime drama. It was about a strong independent woman, her charming and charismatic partner (with a sexy sensitive side), and the great chemistry between them. This is one of those great shows where you learn more about the characters as the seasons progress and you feel like you are part of their team. You get their inside jokes and laugh along with them. If you missed out on it when it originally aired, don't deprive yourself any longer!I bought the box set for fun and to just remember what the show was like. Needless to say, I fell in love with it all over again and could not stop watching until I had seen every episode!"
4,gooses review,"The feelings cd is a good cd in general. The songs on the cd stick more or less to the same theme. The highest quality song on the cd is ""love story"" followed by ""after you my friend"", ""train"", ""may 16"", and ""messengers"". If you really like lagwagon then gun in your hand and leave the light on are good as well. The artwork on both the cd and cover for the cd are humorus especially in comparison with the boring cover on double plaidinum. This cd does seem to be on a different line of thought than lagwagons other albums but it is still good."
2,not good,"If you have heard that lagwagon is good and want to buy a cd don't get this one. It is very whiny ... . There are some good ones, but it is mainly a very annoying cd. After getting this cd I will never buy another lagwagon cd because they have changed their style from punk to whiny, ..., wannabe-punk. If your looking for a good lagwagon cd purchase Double paladium cuz that's a great album."
3,condition not as indicated,"the book condition was fair, but the seller listed it as in very good condition. the spine has damage and the pages are quite earmarked. i have purchased other books from differnt sellers, and as a comparison, this seller did not live up to the stated condition of the book."
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband and I purchased this doll this evening. We were hoping we would get a good deal on a doll that would introduce our son to the idea of potty training, let me say, you really get what you pay for.First we noticed it was impossible not over-fill the dolls mouth, causing water to drip/leak everywhere. Forget trying to get the underwear off. They were stuck in the legs and practically impossible to remove. I have yet to get them back on, which is even more pathetic. Part of teaching is showing the child that underwear/clothing needs to be removed. The difficulty of this dolls clothing makes you want to just leave it nude from the bottom down. POINTLESS.All in all - about the only good thing are the cute little hats. I should have put the $10 towards a better doll. Oh well, live and learn."
2,Fails to address some important issues,"This book is certainly noble in purpose and probably helpful to many, but I was seeking information on overcoming the damage done when people have had premarital sex with others besides their spouses. There was almost none, perhaps because the authors have not been in that situation. Other books about the Christian perspective on sex in general have addressed that issue more fully than this one devoted to ""the consequences of premarital relationships,"" so I was pretty disappointed."
1,Poor Product,I placed an order a couple of days ago for 2 sets of color and black in for my Epson printer as it was running out of ink. The cartridge packaging looked new and even had an expiration date of 11/2006. The ink cartridges printed as if there were no ink. It was worse than my cartridges that were running out of ink.
4,Get ready to get pumped!,"This cd is a great combination of some very talented music makers, there isn't one song that I want to skip! I love to listen to this cd right before I go on the field. The cd booklet has great pictures, too! I suggest this cd for anyone who likes to get pumped and to anyone who loves rock. The only problem, no AC/DC, though it lacked that, it's still great!"
3,not what I thought,My wife was looking for a video that would actually be a lesson to help her learn to give me a lap dance. This video is more of just a porn video.
2,Disappointing,Not great...only one dancer really managed to look erotic/hot. Unfortuneately most of the girls are not really beautiful and when they speak the little charm or sex appeal they have evaporates.
3,"Not an instructional, but performance tape","Yes, there is absolutely no instruction involved in this video, but if you learn by watching, then this is a good one to watch. Specifically, I've yet to see a well-made tape devoted strictly to lap dance. However, this tape does show women doing good routines (although I think a bit more creativity with props and erotic products could have made the routines better) and the girl-girl routines were especially hot and had a lot of energy!"
2,Expected more,Being a VJ and listening to many different styles of electronic music I was really expecting alot more from 242...The visual part was Ok! It is just footages of the race with some filters a little computer rendering so forth not much animation or anything like that. The footage is good some parts are quite nice but over all it could get boring.The music I was expenting more fast paced music but alot it could be like dark atmosphereric some of its more upbeat but really disappoiting I would have say. and there are two versionsthe second version is some guy just talking car and race stuffbut I bought this DVD expenting visuals not technical data about the cars if I wanted that i would go buy a dvd for that. I dont see the point of this.I guess I was expeting too much and the reviews I read were all great and from the packaging and the previews it look very interesting. But overall for the price I payed its ok not bad.
1,Trash & Profanity,What a disappointment! Did not waste my time finishing it. Full of profanity and worthless story line. So many to choose from. DOn't bother with this one.
4,loved the instrumentals- not the vocalists,"Jim should stick to playing- he does it so well!! The vocalists were distracting from his beautiful playing. I just want to hear him play!! If I wanted to hear a vocalist, I would have purchased a Streisand album!! The music that he did play was relaxing, inspirational, and lasting!"
3,More fodder for the AC airwaves...,"After hearing 'Love Of My Life' on the radio, I succumbed to my curiosity and bought Destiny. Some nice piano tunes, a few vocal tunes I could have lived without, but really enjoyed 'Rendezvous' by Jim and Herb Alpert. Nice melodies, nice interplay between the soloists (including a guitarist who's name escapes me). I never heard that one on the radio though."
2,Baby Blue Jeans by Versace for MEN,I DO NOT like Baby Blue Jeans by Versace for Men at all...TOO STRONG of a Lemoneey mixed w/ Baby Powder type of smell. (smells like Lemon Pledge u use to clean with).I would NOT purchase this again.The only reason why I did was because I wanted to TRY it out and the Price was good at around $13 bucks on Amazon.I would suggest you PASS on this one.You will not be satisfied....I wasn't anywayIf you don't believe me......try for yourself ! ; )P. S. If you want to try a decent cologne by Versace go with BLUE JEANS....thats a classic and its a decent price on Amazon at around $20 for a 2.5oz bottle.
4,"Great Shipping, Alright Smell","Received it fast and in perfect condition! Bought this for my boyfriend a few months ago, not knowing that I bought the wrong one haha. I like the scent, in my opinion it smells very lemony and it's a citrus scent that wakens you up. It's not bad but I probably wouldn't buy it again. He seems alright with it though :)"
1,Interesting but NOT practical,"There are many interesting medicines discussed in this book and the authors cite as many studies as possible. However, these studies are not referenced in the book so you can not look them up to find out their validity. More important, doses are not mentioned AT ALL. There is no discussion about the dangers of combining any of the medicines or interactions with prescription drugs that some people may be taking. There are far better books on this subject. Don't buy this one."
1,Ready to buold should read Major parts required.,A ready to build would mean that all the parts are included and you would not have to go out and purchess the main parts to make it usable.
3,"Good swing Set for the price, issues over time","We bought this for our 2 sons ages 3 and 6. My husband bought the lumber and had it up in 2 afternoons working solo. It was a big hit initially with the boys and also the neighbor kids. It's popularity has faded somewhat over time, but the kids are still more eager to get outside than before. We did acquire an old slide from a neighbor and that improved the product greatly.And to the reviewers who were upset that the lumber was not included, do you really expect to get a truckload of lumber, the works of a swingset, and free shipping at this price? Besides, the product description clearly stated that the lumber was not included.Addendum. We've had this for a couple years now. The kids still use it sometimes. My issue with it is that the chains are coated with a rubbery substance that has grown sticky over time and actually leaves residue on your hands. Thinking if we replace the chains it might get more use."
4,does the job,"My kid loves this play set! I was able to construct it myself but a second person is essential for installing the main beam. Only complaint is that the equiptment they give you to intall the swing attachments are pretty cheap. With their design, the provided small thin washers are the only thing that is holding your kid off the ground. I highly recommend going to a harware store to pick up washers that are more durable."
5,Simple yet beautiful words to live by.,East meets West in our modern world and Sakyong Mipham is an excellent spiritual guid through the maliase! He demistifies the mystical.
1,No Review,"Unlike most AP review books, this one fails to include what I'd call ""American History in 150 pages."" The content review is extremely minimal and extremely difficult to navigate. Anyone who sells this book would also sell Kaplan or Princeton Review. Definitely better choices."
4,My US History bible,"This book is great. I had the 1996 edition of this guide and it helped me a lot. I used the book to help me write my essays and DBQ's, all of which I did usually well on. The book helped me to memorize history for my quizzes and exams. However, there is a downside. There's only one complete AP exam in the book and that doesn't provide enough practice. Otherwise, I referred to this book throughout all of my junior year up until the AP exam in May. By the way, I got a 5 on my AP exam, not to mention an end-of-the-year award for excellence in AP US History."
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is such a horrible review guide, I would definitely not recommend it. This book has no history review (yet it's for a history course??) and is all about how to write an essay, a skill we all learned a long time ago. Reading student essays and their critiques is not helpful whatsoever, and to make all of that worse the whole book is written in the most boring, dull and redundant language possible. The only reason I would buy this book is for a cure to insomnia."
3,Great index,"I took the exam yesterday. This guide was very helpful for the multiple-choice portion of the exam, even though there was only one practice section. However, the essays in the beginning of the book were confusing to me and it focused too much on the DBQ, otherwise I would be giving 4 stars. The most helpful part of the book for me was the timeline because it was a very useful reference for issues I had trouble remembering. The index of Presidents and policies was also very helpful. My friends were using other study guides and they were jealous of that index. I would buy this book for the index and the essay material, but for my next AP exam I will also buy a separate book for multiple choice."
1,Failure after 2 years,"Nice picture, beautiful styling, but reliability extremely poor. I expected Sony to be a high quality set, and give at least 5 to 7 years of service in our home, where we only watch TV in the evenings for a few hours, a few nights per week. This set failed with a 2.5"" black band from top to bottom of the screen, which makes watching the HD picture TORTURE! It is well after the 1 year warranty, so I am on my own. Cost to repair versus cost to by SOME OTHER type of set??? Waiting to see."
5,A Fun Pink for girls who love Pink!,This color is fun and a nice matte color of pink. I can't really describe it....it is just a PINK....a colorful pink! I think it is a fun color to add to your collection from the normal pale shimmery pinks.
2,NOT SO GOOD AS THE SOUNDTRACK,"It`s the image album, not the soundtrack album. So, if you like the music as it appears in the movie purchase the OST.In this Image album you have a collection of arrangements from Porco Rosso music in a more simple form, less symphonic and more ""acoustic"". It`s a curious and beautiful album (ah, that love theme!)... but the soundtrack is much better."
4,ohhh the memories,"A good friend and I would watch this every week together it was our favourite show,watching the dvd brought back all those good memories.What a great show loved it then love it now."
5,Perennial greatest TV series candidate,"Great characters. Great writing and directing. Great story-lines. Hill Street Blues passes the ""stands up after time"" standard. It's been long enough, FOX: RELEASE SEASON THREE!"
2,A big disappointment--not at all what I was looking for,"I bought this album primarily for Clint Black's ""Something that we do"". The excellent customer reviews convinced me to buy this album instead of a regular Clint Black album. I was sorely disappointed to find that all the songs on here are strictly instrumental versions. Why in God's name would anyone play a version of ""Something that we do"" without the words? Not that the tune isn't wonderful, but all the meaning is in the lyrics! I'm baffled, and angry that I can't return the CD since it's not at all what I wanted.When I got past my frustration and listened to the rest of the album, I still didn't see what all the fuss was about. Yes, the recording quality is excellent, and the playing is fine. A few of the songs are winners, but many of them sounded very generic to me--not very inventive or original. Maybe some of these are also songs that have lost their meaning by having the lyrics omitted."
5,Ring,Cute toe ring. I received lots of compliments on this toe ring while wearing it during the Spring and Summer.
3,OK.,"Received two of these rings. Ordered only one. Because of low cost, I didn't return it. Gave one as a gift."
5,Beautiful little toe ring,"This is a really nice toe ring. It sparkles when it's on your toe and is really very pretty. It is adjustable, so that is nice. It is very nice and for the price, you just can't go wrong. I would highly recommend buying it. You won't be disappointed."
4,NICE EASY SEASONING,"I enjoy this mix...not quite as spicy as i anticipated from the name, but it is good on everything."
5,great product,This is a great product. It is the same exact brand that my local Nissan dealership sells to their customers.
3,Sleeper,"Close Your Eyes (aka Doctor Sleep) has all the makings of a horror sleeper. I hadn't heard anything about it, and thought the DVD box looked interesting, so I picked it up. I'm used to renting bad movies that have great packaging, so I didn't hold out any great hopes for this one.Surprisingly, this movie has some taut moments and manages to sustain a fairly creepy vibe throughout. There are some logic gaps in the story, and most of them have to do with police procedure, but even with those problems the movie ends up being very watchable. I was left a little unfulfilled by the ending, but overall it's a better than average thriller. Should have been a sleeper hit."
3,robosapien,please dont get it is stinks. I heard their coming out with a new on robosapien V2.IT will interact with its pets the robodino and his dog.he can pick his self up and can walk faster!so dont get the robosapien get the robosapien V2. ITS COMING out in july 2005.
4,A great toy !,My son played with this at a friends house. He is 10yrs and couldn't keep his hands off of it. He got it to do all sorts of things and especially liked when it picked up a small toy and threw it at someone. I bought it for his birthday (Oct 12) wait until he sees it!!!He will go bonkers!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Pretty good robot!,"This is a great robot. It can interact with other robots but it is great. It can dance, do karate, whistle, fart, and more. The company who made it added secret things it can do that make it so much better. You can search on google.com autonomy secret for Robosapien. It makes it do so much more. Make sure its not other versions of the Robosapien. There are ways to make it better by unscrewing it and reprogramming it and there are easier ways were you only have to type things in order on the controller.If you want to use the hidden things it can do it is to hard for 7 year olds. I love this toy. All Wowwee products are fantastic."
5,it was great,"My 7yr son loved it.it is 1/3 smaller than the old robosapien, and the voice is more Japanese.otherwise still a good toy."
1,FOR GEEKS ONLY!,"Unless you have a high IQ please don't even bother use. I got one for Xmas. It was incredibly hard to get out the box and we had to buy batteries too. Finally on mine the infra-red signal (what makes him ""obey your commands"") was totally broke. Even if he hadn't been broke it wouldn't have been much fun since you have to use color codes on the remote which is so complicated an adult would have a hard time working the robot. You are better off buying a more creative robot kit that actually lets you build the robot. This kit is for uncreative geeks only."
1,"Thin, weak and inaccurate...","...probably like the law-dawgs that wrote it.I really can't recommend this even as light entertainment. If you know absolutely NOTHING about the lifestyle then you might pick something up, but you'd be better off watching a couple of 60's biker flicks and it would be more fun too.What you do read here that isn't common knowledge is mostly wrong. An example: The Filthy Few are hardcore assassins according to this book. According to Chuck Zito they're just the most incorrigible of party animals that show up first, go home last and ingest any and all mind altering substances in between. That's quite a difference of opinion there. (I've heard the theory that Zito is just trying to throw law-enforcement off the trail with this statement, but I'M not going to call Zito a liar.)It's about 44 double spaced pages in outline format. Dry and uninspiring; if you simply MUST you can get through it in an hour. But don't say I didn't warn you."
3,"Beautiful photos, lots of info","I too have fond memories of beautiful lilacs in a yard known in childhood. I also had a lilac years ago here in Phoenix in the heart of the low desert. It would have done well here if I had been a better caretaker. I have to fault this book for not meeting my own particular needs. The author is a Canadian and seems very good on northern lilacs, but I need to know about those that can thrive on mild winters and extreme summer heat and dryness. Ms. Bennett does touch on the topic of southern lilacs, but there does not seem to be an easy way to sort out what varieties would work here. (I have bought the book.)"
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I got this book as a gift which was purchased on Amazon from my wish list.I was Somewhat disappointed` because from the title I expected something that;* Explains how to select motors to meet specific requirements* The use of motor curves published by manufacturers to determine the best motor for the need* Pros and cons on different motor types* More detail on motor construction* Typical lifetime of types of brushed motors* Best motor types for smooth operation verses high torque applicationsThis book was more into bullet points, than detailed explanations of what construction is best for different application. In many cases I can get more detail on motor construction from Wikipedia."
3,Strange DVD,"The exercises in this DVD are helpful, but the music sounds like the kind of music you would hear if watching a porno movie. Once I master the exercises, I am going to do them with the mute on.If I'd known it, I would have bought a book instead."
3,"The night light is great, but no small plush turtle","My kids love this turtle night light. They turn it on every night at bedtime, along with a clock radio tuned to a classical station with the radio on 45-minute sleep mode. The whole setup has worked just great for a nice segue from playtime to chill out time.The only caveat is that the nightlight did not come with the small plush turtle. I wrote to the seller, and they say that it is on backorder (it's been a month), so don't advertise the small plush turtle to the kids (as we did with our birthday girl.) Otherwise, a hit."
4,Adorable,"I always wanted something like this for my little boy and when I found it, I was so excited! It lightens up the whole room with stars and you can even change it from one color to another with a choice of three different colors (Blue, green and amber). Plus it turns itself off in 45 minutes. My son loves it!"
5,Great buy!,"We received this as a gift for our first daughter when she was a year old. She is almost three now and still loves it! Turning ""the moon and stars on"" is a comforting night time ritual. It doubles as a nightlight, so in either mode it keeps kids comfortable in the darkness. We now give these as gifts! Everyone love them!"
3,"Short,Poetic, and Refreshing","I could not give this book five stars because some parts like the description of the elephant seals was just disturbing even though it was just an accurate description from Maxine Hong Kingston's point of view...and because it could at times be confusing.What I did like about this book was the quick pace at which it can be read while not sounding shallow. I especially like the little sketches that were doodles drawn literally and figuratively(through words).I liked seeing the author mature as a poet as the book progressed. The writing got smoother and less disjointed.I liked how she brought uniqueness to her writing by not being a native speaker of English,because that added and did not take away from her words.I think this is a nice read for college students on up, just because it provides a little insight into writing that will not only come in handy personally, but also inpersonally by seeing things through Kingston's eyes."
5,Great!,Awesome music from Vineyard! This album is great all the way through! Biblical songs from scripture that really groove! I like every song on here.
3,"Focus, focus, focus","This book sets an audacious epic framework for itself and then goes on and on and on. It probably would have been better if it were at least two hundred pages shorter -- tighter and more focused. It's certainly an impressive foray into the cultural history and mindset of the CIA, but I would ask all of the reviewers that have given it five stars: Thematically speaking, what, ultimately, is it about? The book has no unifying theme and therefore does not coelesce with the power of a great novel."
1,mudd,"One of most disappointing books I've ever slogged through. An uneventful and unexciting passing of time through the life of a CIA agent and major touch points in CIA history. 1400 pages without crescendo or inflection. I wanted someone to shoot me when I was done reading this. The only reason I read to its end is because I thought it was impossible to write this much without really getting to a high point. To add insult to the mental injury, the book seems incomplete. As though Mailer needed more pages to drone on about the life of the lead character in a follow-on novel. I never wanted to burn a book until I finished reading this one."
4,"The Shock Absorber Handbook, Reviewed","The Shock Absorber Handbook is a good work, providing hundreds of formulas for computing load-dampening responses. Somewhat overly detailed on advanced theories,with strong references to hi-performance applications. It is the book you picture as a classic textbook for a college-level shock-design course.

2,What IS this???,"This is deffinately Weird Al at his lowest.I only bought this for the song Midnight Star (whuch IS good, but still) and I liked the first half, but WHAT is this crap on the soncond half?? I have never known Al to be as vulgar and bad mouthed as in ""Nature Trail to Hell""! This is NOT genuine Weird Al. If you want what I think Weird Al is all about, buy 'Dare to be Stupid', 'Alapalooza', or 'Bad Hair Day'. Thank you."
4,"A ""Weird Al"" CD worth buying!","""Weird Al"" is one of the most creative people on the face of the Earth, and this CD is one example to back up my theory. With hit songs like ""Eat It"", ""I lost on Jeopordy"", and ""The Rye or the Kaiser: Theme of Rocky VIII"", this CD is worth getting. I was a little dissapointed in ""Nature Trail to Hell"". Some of the lyrics were funny, but I couldn't imagine Weird Al singing such a profane song. Also ""Midnight Star"" wasn't as great as I heard it was, and neither was ""Buy Me a Condo"". But some pretty good songs like ""That Boy Could Dance"", ""Polkas on 45"" and ""Mr. Popeil"" can fill in the dullness gaps left behind by these surprisingly mediocre songs. Just the same, if you are a big ""Weird Al"" fan you'd probably like most of the songs on this ""Al""-bum just like I did!"
3,A beginning.....,"Besides a couple of songs (Midnight Star, Eat It, and I Lost on Jeopardy) this CD is just not so hot. But you can definetly see where Al came from. And just to let you know....Nature Trail to Hell is a pretty good song. Unfortunatly it is supremely long. Too much solos, and screaming."
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,"I agree with the reader ""North Cali"" the book was hard to follow. I don't feel like I got the point of the story...maybe it's because I'm not into Broadcasting...I seriously doubt it though. I've read many books dealing w/ things I'm not into and have enjoyed them. When I finally finished the book I thought why did I waste my time. Don't wait for the paperback...I think this is one book you could really do without reading."
2,BOOOORRRINNNG,"I have met Yolanda joe at several venues, and I must admit that she is down to earth and friendly individual. I am a fan of her previous books, however, This just in was a difficult read and boring. I stopped in the middle of the book and gave it back to a co-worker whom I borrowed it from. I understand that she is from the journalism field, but as another reviewer wrote, a writer can give a reader a new perspective in an enlightening way. This book did not deliver. I am disappointed, but i did not waste my money. I will continue to support Yoland joe in the furture, however, it appears as though our new bred of writers is allowing their names to carry them and they are not producing the kind of enjoyable material that made them a household name."
3,A reader in No. Cali,"I was so eager to read this next book by Yolanda Joe, but I found it very hard to follow. Because I have no idea about the broadcasting environment I felt like I never got the point of the story. I was in hope this latest book would be as thrilling as her past two books. Like another reader said, wait for the paperback."
3,Behind the scene of tv news !,"First I must say this novel was certainly different from Yolanda's great work in the past ! While it is a good read done in her great way of telling a great story this story is strictly about going behind the scenes of a tv news broadcast station! She dealt with sexism, and racism !If you have ever wondered what goes on behind the scene of a tv news broadcast station be sure to read this book now ! If not ,I would suggest you wait until TJI... comes out in the paperback version to avoid disappointment ! While I did enjoy the novel and thought it was a good read I would have prefered ,to wait for the paperback version. ! Now you have it .... IMO"
1,"Sad, really sad!","I was very, very disappointed in Yolanda Joe's new book...I found it followed no logical sequence....I can usually read a book within 2 to 3 days, but after I was approximatley half way through this one, I was through..I am now wrapping it to return to the seller....I cannot in good faith keep it...sorry, but this book was SORRY!"
4,Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War,"When I bought this book, in March 1981, it still had a stylish black-and-white cover with red text and a Hinomaru on the spine, but apart from that the book above is the same standard reference I still use for Japanese planes. Though the texts are rather short, and there are no colour paintings or photographs in the book - as with all other books in the Putnam series -, really all Japanese planes get mentioned. Combined with the two books by Donald W. Thorpe about Japanese camouflage and markings you have a good starting point for research of about literally all planes flown by the Japanse from 1937 till 1945. To really top it off you could also buy the eight Osprey/Aircams about Japanese planes, or all 16 'aircraft in profiles', which would give you more additional information about colour schenmes and markings, and also some aditional photographs, but the backbone of your Japanese library would still be the book by René J. Francillon, Ph.D."
5,Great documentaries and videos,"Despite what other reviewers may have said, the format of this DVD is very simple. Sure you have to click around a lot to find everything but the main attractions (2 Documentaries & Music Videos) aren't too hard to find. The first Documentary ""Who Then Now"" covers the band from when it started through the making of their 2nd album, it runs 40 min. The second Documentary ""Deuce"" takes care of everything else in Korn's career up until they performed at Woodstock, it runs 75 min. Within the Documentaries all of Korn's Music Videos are shown, but a menu of them can also be found. The videos are for the songs Blind, Shoots & Ladders, Clown, Faget, A.D.I.D.A.S., Got the Life, Freak on a Leash, Falling Away from Me, Make Me Bad, Somebody Someone, and the Make Me Bad Remix."
2,I FEEL LIKE BEING COMMITTED TO AN ASYLUM...,"After just trying to find Korn's videos on this DVD. Great content...if you can find it. They really need to add an option on this DVD for full playback for those who do not have the patience to navigate through the 'asylum'. The ""who then now"" portion is pretty easy to find. the newer videos it takes upwards of an hour to locate. Reccommended for die hards only."
3,Good Movie...Bad DVD.,"This is Korn's new DVD, Deuce. It also features their previously only VHS-released Who Then Now? video. It has all their videos, the ""Make Me Bad"" remix video, and behind the scenes for every just about every video. The problem:finding these features. Example:I've found the Who Then Now? video on the first day. I went searching for the music videos (which ae right by the Behind the Scenes videos), which took me 2 days. I still haven't found the self-titled Deuce video. I don't know if it's supposed to be a maze or what, but either way, it's very annoying. Just buy the VHS. Even if it dosen't have all the bonus features, it saves the frustartion."
2,Excelente telenovela! TERRIBLE edición!,"""Cuando me Enamoro"" ha sido una de las mejores novelas de Televisa en los últimos tiempos. Logró mantenerme en la expectativa de lo que pasaría. Tuvo un grandioso elenco y una calidad de producción de LUJO. Pero, el DVD de esta telenovela fue pésimo. Los primeros 3 discos están más o menos bien editados, pero de momento el disco 4, suceden cosas que hacen que uno se pregunte lo que acaba de pasar. Me decepcionó que la mayoría de las escenas de Fina en la última etapa de la telenovela NO salen. Cortaron muchísimo!! Entiendo que la novela duró 8 meses, etc. pero al menos hubieran añadido un 5to disco. Si la viste en TV completa, y quieres tener un recuerdo, entonces cómprala porque la mayoría de las escenas buenas están, pero si la piensas ver por primera vez, mejor espera que la repitan por Telefutura o Univision tlnovelas."
3,Not sturdy enough,"I do not think the product was bad. However, it was not sturdy enough in my opinion. I tried to use an umbrella stand instead of mounting it into the ground so I could easily move the set around, but the pole was not strong enough when hitting the ball. Even if I mounted it into the ground, I personally do not think it would have been sturdy. Having a single pole (instead of a pole that you have to put together) is probably the best option. I had to return the Halex Select set and will look for one with a single pole (preferably with a stand that comes with it so I can easily move it around to different parts of my yard)."
4,Easy read,"This publication is especially helpful for the first time cruiser, and is a good brush up for the seasoned one. Easy reading nicely arranged."
2,A cute rendition of common sense.,"Not only is this book little (literally), it contains facts even novice cruisers are aware of (such as myself). Occasionally, I felt as though some of the comments were condescending, don't do this, do do that..., etc. There were a few nice ideas in the book but overall I was disappointed in the quality of the book and for paying extra to have it shipped faster to me."
5,"Questions on Legality, Morality and Equity.","This book is a must, even to those who are remotely interested in knowing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Judiciously authored by the renowned international jurist Dr. Henry Cattan, who in 1946 gave evidence before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on the Palestine Question, this monumental work critically examines the origins of this conflict up to modern times.Being a lawyer by profession, much of the discussion is predictably on the legal aspects of this conflict. The duplicity of the Balfour declaration (1917) and the unlawful establishment of the Jewish state are well documented. Additionally, this book coherently undermines the numerous myths perpetrated by the pro-Zionist propaganda. Easy to read and packed with concrete information, `The Palestine Question' will be particularly engaging to students of history and international law. Do make the effort to promote this book as widely as possible."
4,Medocre compared to some of his others,"This is a fairly good CD. Al's done much better, and he's done much worse. ""Dare to be Stupid"" is by far the best. ""Like a Surgeon"" is ok, and so is ""Girls just wanna have lunch"" and ""I want a new duck"". ""Yoda"" is funny, even if (like me) you aren't a Star Wars fan. These are all of the songs I remember the titles to. The rest are forgetable and lackluster. Buy this CD if you are a diehard Al fan. If you aren't, wait until it shows up in your gold box someday."
2,Look instead for the skeletal truth,"In my opinion, as a Chameleons fan, a person new to the band would be better served finding their Script of the Bridge studio album, or, failing that, Strange Times, or the Peel Sessions. Don't rely on this as representative of one of the gems of UK bands at all."
3,Beware of Bounceback Express for Macbook Intel laptops,I sent my new Macbook Pro(Intel Pentium II) back twice to the factory and had it gutted to find the problem of it crashing. It turns out it is the Bounceback Express Software that this device comes with. The software is like a virus itself because it constantly is working to find updates. It would freeze up my cursor and scramble the keyboard lettering.As for this drive it works great with out the software and is very fast to upload using firewire. I would NOT put that evil software in your precious system. I also read on these reviews that some of these devices can have virusses inside so be weary of that.
4,MAGNIFICENT SINGING AND SUPERB ARRAINGMENTS,"YOU MUST HEAR IT AND COMPARE IT TO ""SWEET CONTROL-THE BEST OF JON LUCIEN""."
5,Can you critics say F-A-N-T-A-S-Y?,"Jeeezzz...Some of you are looking for logical plot endings, complex characters, and great dialog.This movie is meant to ENTERTAIN... This is not meant to be a realistic dinosaur movie -- it's FANTASY so cut it some slack.By the way, I thought the sets were awesome -- made me want to visit Waterfall City. And the acting wasn't that bad either."
2,Not So Gentle,"I purchased this video because the chiropractor advised me to try Yoga. I have never done Yoga. I wish there was a booklet along with the video instead of trying to flip though a chart on the video for poses. After trying several of these exercises that are labeled ""gentle"" I could barely move the next day. I have never tried the video again."
5,Gentle and Thorough Beginning to Yoga,"I enjoy this program very much. Since I have never used an excerise video before, I didn't know what to expect. This one turned out to be a very good choice. Its easy and fun while still being valuable for its thorough workouts. Zyrka goes slowly and picks simple but deeply satisfying poses. There is music in the background, which is neither too loud or irratating. Most of all, I like being able to adjust how much time I spent with the lessons, an advantage with all DVD's. I highly recommend this product."
1,Get the Garmin 305 Instead,"I got the RS400 to replace the Polar 625X--which failed to connect to my computer just after the warranty expired. key thing about this device is being able to download data to the computer to use the analyzing software. Unfortunatly, I am RETURNING the RS 400 becuase it FAILS TO DOWNOAD to the computer--even using the very expensive POLAR brand IRD interface device. The old watch (625x) was always very touchy to download, took many tries. This fails to transfer at all. I've had the Garmin 305 for 2years and love it. It downloads thru a USB connector every time. the only reason I tried to get polar again is to for the OWN INDEX test. But I don't need to spend $249 for only that functoin when the Garmin 305 does everything else and also has a robust analytical software program (but you cannot print it). really wanted to give Polar another chance and really disappointed. GET THE GARMIN 305 INSTEAD!-middled aged female athlete"
3,Expectations,"USABILITY: Dark viewer, small and unclear digitsRESISTANCE: big glass, but un-protectedMONITOR: perfect, captures heart rate in seconds, accurateBEAUTY: owesome, very beautiful"
4,"hey, i liked this","the music on this cd is great. really neat guitar lines that echo Johnny Marr's work in The Smiths, excellent bass playing that has grace and style, and drumming that is so good, it hurts. but the vocals are going to be the ""make it or break it"" element that determine if Life Without Buildings is your cup of tea. Sue Tompkins waifishly belts out her lines as if she was reading from her journal. most of her lyrics are spoken in soft Scottish tones and many times she repeats the same word over and over again to the rhythm of the song. a unique style of vocals, for sure. but if you can tolerate her style, this band is great. very tightly wound and full of a confident stride. and the production is smooth and clean; allowing all the elements of the band's sound and style to be fully exposed. and using no dubbing or overlays really gives a fleshed out feeling. pretty neat little album from this band."
1,Tastes like chalk!,My boys absolutely hated these vitamins. Couldn't understand why until I tasted one for myself; all I can say is YUCK!
5,Teaching the comparative idiots,"The late Carl Sagen had a wonderful way of relating his apparent knowledge of everything into a form that comparative idiots can understand. His genius appears to be, not just his ability to formulate the evalution of the cosmos into something understandable to himself, but into a book understandable to those of us with IQs less than was his 150-plus. I've read this book a couple of times, as well as ""A Brief History Of Time"" by Stephen Hawking. Both books are wonderful in the authors' attempts to share their enthusiasm of science and physics, but the difference is Sagen's ability to simplify the topic for the common intellect. Hawking either seems unable to to so, or is tackling subject matter much too difficult for the general public. Not so for Sagen... AND Perhaps even now a life-form on another planet across a hundred billion stars from Earth is observing our planet as it appeared in the past, in a better time when the great Carl Sagen lived among us."
1,This book is not for educated people.,Maybe in the 70s there was something interesting that one could get from this book but in 2010s its just pure boredom.Especially going through the ending is very painful.
5,This Is A Must Read Book,"Simply put, this is one of the books that makes you both extremely proud and extremely amazed to be alive here and now. Nobody should go without reading this wonderful work of nonfiction."
1,Amazon Description is FALSE; No Color Images in Kindle Edition,"Amazon falsely claims ""This visually stunning book with over 250 full-color illustrations..."" in its description for the Kindle Edition.There are NO COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS or color photos in the Kindle edition. Yet, if you are an owner of a Kindle Fire, you would expect this edition to include the 250+ color illustrations as are shown in the hard copy book edition. Amazon needs to either provide a color edition for the Kindle Fire, or take down their FALSE ADVERTISING, when someone selects the Kindle edition review."
4,Series is improving.,"Hiromu Arakawa, Fullmetal Alchemist, vol. 5 (ViZ, 2003)I'm really starting to like Winry as a character. Once their small band reaches Rush Valley, we get involved in a mini story arc where Winry, who's also looking to better herself (despite the fact that everyone in Rush Valley marvels over the complexity of Ed's prosthetics), makes a journey deep into the mountains to submit herself as an apprentice to Dominic, the universally-acknowledged best automail artist in Rush Valley. Most of the rest of the volume (the last chapter finds Ed and Al at their teacher's place reminiscing) details the goings-on at Dominic's little campground. We get to know the people there, and get some tantalizing clues about the past doings of Winry's grandmother. The series just keeps getting better. ***"
5,How now sacred brown cow,"Mr. Lakshminarayan's review is not a review at all; it's a smug and self-satisfied misreading of Nietzsche and Foucault, a transparent piece of projection/reaction formation. Ignore it. This book is not intended to change the world, but rather to reflect it in such a way that the reader laughs, squirms, recognizes his/her own hypocrisy and the blatant absurdity of most unquestioned social conventions. In this, Crasta succeeds in ways not unlike Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat character or Chris Rock race routines succeed, i.e., brilliantly. As social criticism the book is potent enough, but the sheer zany exuberance of it all make it far more than that-a delicious and mischievious pleasure. Highly recommended."
1,Not What I expected,"Although, the heart in this album is present the production as a whole is very weak. The sound is far from reggae although it is advertised as R&B influenced Reggae. The sound just doesn't have it. I do enjoy ""Lion of Judah"" and ""Speak the Truth(Rocker's Alley Remix), but overall the album doesn't have the same quality that I would have expected when four out of five of Christafari's members leave and collaborate. It is just a very poor production overall."
4,"Smallest footprint, corded, 2-line phone on the market","This is a great phone! It's the smallest footprint, corded, 2-line phone on the market. I bought it from 101Phones.com for $36.99. It's got great sound quality. It's well-built. It's got true hold and conferencing features. It's not too pricey. And the ear piece volume has a dial adjustment (not just a switch).Downsides?No caller ID !!No speaker phone.The illumnated handset is not quite bright enough for me. It does not have lights behind the buttons; it merely has a tiny yellow light aimed down at the buttons.If it had caller ID, I would have given it five stars."
4,5 Stars for price,"I bought a Logitec MX 1000 laser mouse, and didnt like the feel of it so i traded it in for this one and like it better. Laser Mice have no adantage over optical dont waste your money."
3,Nice But...,"I have got used to buying bulk packs of AA bateries for this.It oftens says 'low battery' and there is still lot of life in it.If you are using it with a OMNI-Cube switching between many PCs you have to be on that PC when you power up otherwise the Mouse is not detected, unlike if it were a traditional mouse.I also get the mouse pointer jumping all over the place selecting at random (like it is not calibrated) which requires me to Alt+Ctrl+Del+Esc a couple of times to normalize it.The horrozontal scroll does not always work in many windows applications (fine in MSIE) but no is VS2005But on the plus side, fits nice in the hand, is a good work horse so I got use to feeding it batteries, and dont switch off the PCs much."
3,too big. bad 4th and 5th buttons position.,"I've big hands and even so I found this mouse a little awkward. I did'n like the 4th and 5th buttons. Some times I pressed them involuntarily and I really ended not using them at all. I found the battery life to short too, but I do like the precision."
5,Great Product,"First of All the mouse is not all black like the picture shows.the mouse design is great , its very comfortable .and I love the magnifying button on the side , very helpful when the works are really small. Great Product Great Buy5 Stars"
3,Large receiver,"When I first got the box for my mouse the first thing I thought was ""this thing must have a huge manual""...only to find out that the wireless receiver for the mouse is about the same size as a regular optical mouse itself. This defeated the whole purpose of a wireless mouse in the sense that my aim was to reduce clutter on my desktop...not have the equivalent of two mice on it! Performancewise I have no complaints whatsoever....it works wonderfully...soft touch keys as well as two prorammable buttons...I love the zoom feature. If you're going to buy this as a replacement for the ole ball & chain corded mouse be muy guest, if yu want a neater workspace...skip it and go onto your next choice."
2,ms wireless optical mouse 5000 - negative review,"I found this mouse virtually useless given the graphics paces I needed to put it through. Aside from very frustrating inaccuracy, the thumb buttonsare placed too high,a completely inergonomic setup. When the hand is resting on a mouse, the thumb naturally rests inferiorly, on the desktop surface, not up at the top edge of the mouse. Additionally, it is extremely awkward to depress the thumb buttons without inadvertantly depressing the buttons on the opposite side. Finally, the clicking itselfwas not smooth."
4,Nice Mouse,"NOt too bad of a mouse. Seems to work fine. Perfect size for me but a little big for my wife. Overall, I'd buy another one. One dissapointment is no ""off"" switch. No way to save battries. Batt life is good."
5,Love the ergonomics of this,"Having worked on the computer all my life since they came out and having had bi lateral carpal tunnel surgery, I look for things helpful and that has ergonomics. It fits great in your hand and extremely comfy. Best mouse i've had and that is saying alot being on computers over 20 years at work. Someone sent me a brand new logitech and it is no where near as good as this one."
5,Good Mouse,"I've had this mouse for a couple of years, and so far, so good. My hands are big, so most mice do not fit my hand well. This one does the trick though. The mouse's weight is also just right. It has all the side buttons I need, a nice, big scroll wheel, and the setup for it is straightforward. Just install the drivers on the disc and you're good to go. You can also program any of the buttons to do whatever you want, so its capabilities are quite flexible. Battery life is very good as well. I've only had to change the batteries about 5 times over the past 2 years. The only thing I can complain about is the mouse sometimes seems to move just a little bit on its own. It wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't take the computer's monitor out of sleep mode.The mouse is fairly accurate, reliable, efficient, ergonomic, and well worth the money. I would buy another in a heartbeat if this one broke."
4,Pretty good for gaming,"I've used this mouse heavily for about 4 years. This is definitely a mouse that you put your palm on. There's a decent polling rate such that you can give a quick swipe without having the cursor hang. Compared to wired gaming mice it's not the best but this is the best wireless mouse I've tried for fps gaming. Since the wheel is ""smooth"" scrolling if you press the middle button sometimes it scrolls a tad. Sucks to zoom in with sniper rifle and then suddenly switch weapons. But this happens with regular mice too, just a lesser extent.Of note you may have to position the wireless receiver in a few places before you get perfect signal. Also since the polling rate is so high the battery life isn't the best. I use only one nimh battery in the mouse and it lasts for a month (8 hours a day). You could use two batteries if you'd like but it's too heavy for my taste."
1,Not made to last,I bought this mouse in June 2011 and here it is December 26 2011 and the right button is blown out. I am not a gamer but I do use it for more than 10 hours every day.I would not recommend this mouse to anyone.
2,The egonomically sticky optical mouse,"This battery eating devil is ergonomic to the human hand until years of use cause it to become a gooey sticky mess. The rubber grippy handhold sides degrade over time and begin to shed god-knows-what kind of chemical muck on your fingers. Once it comes to this stage, it gathers hair, dust and crumbs like duct tape residue. The mouse sides become impossible to wipe clean with a mild household cleaner and paper towel when it devolves. Selection of materials used for this product were a mistake in my opinion. Otherwise, this mouse would be comfortable to use if it didnt have an annoying set of magnify zoom buttons that you accidently press from time to time and try to remember how to disable."
1,This mouse is broken by design,"Unlike most of my other MS mice that I've owned in the past, this one is terribly unresponsive when trying to move the cursor or scrollwheel. It jumps into power save mode or something after a ludicrously short idle time, and needs time to ""wake up"" practically every scroll/cursor move. As far as my hours troubleshooting go, I do not think it is possible to alter this use-case oblivious design."
1,I hate myself for buying this,"1.- The receiver its HUGE!...its like a fat extra mouse with a looooong wire...looses the whole point of the ""wireless"" feature. Thats why its not shown on the pics.2.- The wheel runs free, forget about the standard ratchet type. The buttons doesnt ""click"", they just depress smoothly...as if you dont want to wake up your wife while working late on the bed.3.- Doesnt have an on-off button on the back, the laser is always ""on"" unless you remove the batteries.4.- the extra buttons (4th and 5th) are difficult to reach when you need them, except for when you dont...and you trip on them.5.- Its UGLY!..and HUGE!...and its MICROSOFT!"
1,This CD SUCKS! ! !,"I purchased this CD expecting MUSIC. Unfortunately the CD contains screaming no-name wannabe's that don't even know how the actual music sounds. And they call this a ""tribute"" album?!?!?"
2,Phone falls out easily,I have bought many items from Amazon and this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review. The only redeeming feature of this holster is that it is more convenient to use than carry the phone in your pocket. The phone will fall out with any bump against it. I have dropped the phone many times and find myself constantly checking to see that the phone is secure in its holster. I will be looking for a new one to replace this one..
2,Poor Design,This holster is poorly designed. The cell phone will not remain securely seated in the holster if bumped or nudged from the bottom. My phone has popped out of its holster several times and hit the ground. Not good!
2,Over price status symbol book,"Once again, I find another [...] publication not living up to the hype in other dragondoor books. The price [...] was not worth it. The book had few illustrations and and seldon corresponded to the type. A person could get very frustrated in trying to figure out how to do these few exercises. There were never enough illustrations to properly understand the exercises.Horrible - little thought went into this book just hype on how to be a great player. Dragondoor is a rip -off factory. NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,G.B.H. - 'Celebrity Live Style' (Cleopatra),"'Celebrity...' appears(to me anyway)to be like a band-released effort.The way the 'live' sound is slightly distorted.Not too bad,though.Was recorded at two(2)different shows - November 11&12,1988.A decent hardcore/punk pressing.Tunes that sort of made me sit up and take some notice were ""Hearing Screams"",""Grinning For The President"",""20 Floors"",""Sick Boy"" and their Stooges cover ""I Feel Alright"".Current line-up is what I believe the original one,that remains intact to THIS very day,except for the drummer.Colin Abrahall-vocals,Colin Blyth-guitar,Ross Lomas-bass and Scott Preece-drums.Should appeal to fans of U.K.Subs,Gang Green,D.R.I.,Black Flag and Agent Orange."
1,VERY Christian 'guide' to married life...,Very old fashioned(...) Many of the questions revolve around the woman staying home and not working. Also VERY Christian. The workbook focuses exclusively on Protestant beliefs to the exclusion of all other religious and spiritual perspectives. The book even makes statements about how God should influence financial decisions in the marriage! Not recommended for non-Protestants.
5,"Really great camera, but the film is kinda pricy","This is a really durable camera. i've dropped it about a billion times, and it still works as well as ever! The focus isn't all that great, and the pix aren't SUPER high quality, but considering the price... but the pix are absolutely adorable. the size is so cute. i definitely recommend this camera!"
1,No Longer In Production,"Shipper was great to work with and quickly refunded my money, but you can't buy film for this anywhere anymore, as it is not being made any longer!"
5,Enjoyed this book immensely,"This was an extremly well written, entertaining book. The author has obviously done her research, and it was wonderful to be tranported back to the regency era. Characters were entertaining, and the romance very believable."
5,So far this book has been very helpful,"I have not finished the workbook yet, but I must say, so far it has been very insightful in helping me discover my money issues!"
5,Just ask,"Fantastic Discounts and Deals for Anyone Over 50! is packed with dozens of discounts on all sorts of products and services. Only $9.95, you'll get your money back in no time at all. Right after reading it I noticed a number of discounts we could take advantage of, many I would never have thought of. Anyone who is at least 50 years old and interested in saving money should have a copy."
5,Excellent aid to prepare for and take an important test or exam,"I am a trained hypnotherapist myself, but bought this cd to prepare for an important upcoming professional exam. The hypnotic sessions (there are two), are well-scripted and the hypnotherapist uses great technique. I highly recommend this CD to anyone preparing for an important exam or just as an aid in studying. Even if you don't experience test-taking anxiety, this cd will help you gain confidence as you master study material."
2,Siouxsie deserves better...,"Excited about a cover album of songs by one of my favorite bands, I eagerly purchased this album even though I had only heard of one of the bands on it(Switchblade Symphony). Quelle disappointment! Where is the passion? Better yet, where is the musicianship? Absolutley nothing really creative. The only song worth listening to twice is ""Red Over White"". The Banshees influenced countless bands like Hole, Garbage and Curve, to name just a few. Why can't bands of this caliber get together and pay tribute? God knows the Banshees deserve it."
2,bad reactions from too many critics..,"THIS IS A TRIBUTE ALBUM ,WHAT DO WE EXPECT,SIOUXSIE AND HER BANDMATES TO PLAY IN IT?..LET'S BE REAL TRIBUTE ALBUMS ARE MOSTLY ADECUATE ,WITHOUT SHOWING ANY POTENTIAL FOR BRILLIANCE,,,,,IF GREAT MUSIC IS WHAT WE ARE AIMING FOR ,PERHAPS WE NEED TO STOP COMPLAINING ,AND STICK WITH THE ORIGINALS....SO LET'S SHOW SOME SUPPORT , AND STOP TRYING TO BE MUSIC CRITICS, UNLESS WE HAVE THE MUSICAL TALENT TO BACK IT UP..............THANK YOU. MACHI BABACHI"
1,WASTE,"There are some rarities, but it is a shame, a home burned dvd with poor quality. Don't waste your time, your money and your hopes."
5,best thing with best price!!,"I have never written any reviews in my entire life, this is the 1st time ever!!! i really wanna share this with all of you.....Recently, i have lots of breakout all over my face. I have been trying lots of products which cost me more than $500, but none of them is works!! Because I have spent part of my saving on those useless yet expensive products, so i would like to give this ""low-price"" Cleansing pad a try... wow!! these pad work like magic!! after less than 1 month of use, my face is obviously clear... no more breakouts... trust me, give this a try n u will love it...how i use it: after cleaning my face with cleansing foam (other brand), i pat my face dry with tissue paper, then i clean my face again with 1 of this Desert Cleansing pad, let my face rest for about 10 sec, then apply toner (other brand)and desert essence moisturizer... that's it... i'm so happy that i have found this product!!!"
3,gentle?,"Some reviews have said that these are really gentle but this is not the case for me! They are very intense with a very intense feel, I used it the first time and had a Home Alone-type moment. I am not allergic to anything (I've checked) so I don't know what the deal is. I have sensitive skin, so maybe that's it. They definitely cleaned my face, but I am not sure I can use them when they have this burn effect!"
3,Strong Medicine,"I use the the liquid face wash made by the same people and I really like it. However, I think these pads are incredibly strong. If you're prepared for very abrasive texture and overwhelming scent this is the cleansing pad for you. I don't want to diminish the benefits of tea tree oil, I just think everyone has a different threshold for scent and feel. Whenever I opened the jar my eyes watered profusely. I gave them fair a try but I had to give these bad boys away."
2,New packaging and different product!!,"I have used the tea tree oil cleansing pads and fell in love! My skin was never as clear as it was while using this amazing product! When it came time to reorder, I ordered 2 knowing that I would definitely use them all up. The problem is, when the product arrived, it was in a new package. This jar was white whereas my old trusted product came in a brown jar with brown lid and green label. I figured that it must be the same product only in a different packaging.....WRONG!!!!!!!! The pads were dried out, the smell was different, and there was no tingle on my face telling me it was working. I compared the ingredients from the old packaging, and found slight variations but the end product is completely different in my opinion. I need to find the old product again in the old packaging. I will be contacting the seller."
2,great product...horrible company!,I have been using this product for a few months. It is a good natural alternative to all of those cleansing towelettes that are on the market. The ingredients are much better for your skin than the other cleansers out there. I haven't noticed any difference in my breakouts but these pads remove face makeup. The reason I only gave two stars is because of the problems that I have had with the company. I highly suggest that you buy these in a store versus buying them with [...]. I never received my order and sent many unanswered emails to ask what happened. After my fourth email within 2 months I finally received a reply saying they would look into the problem. It has been 2 weeks since that reply and I still have not heard back. If only this company had better customer service.
3,Could be peppier,"I don't think this is as awful as other reviewers say, but it's not as effective as the amazon.com reviewer claims, either.Musically, I prefer the Michel Plasson-directed Orphee on EMI. It's both more sprightly and more profound, capturing the full range of Offenbach's unique genius.The singing here is generally lovely (with some exceptions), and the set fantastic. There are some wonderful visual moments, but the pace isn't quite exciting or dramatic enough, ditto the comedic moments, and the choreography could be more imaginative.PBS did a brilliant one decades ago that I've rarely seen or heard surpassed; sadly, it's not available."
3,Offenbach's Train of Thought,"This is a good production of one of Offenbach's more popular operettas with good cast and orchestra. The setting is that of Nineteenth Century Paris, not Classical Greece. The setting, I suppose, makes a statement, but frankly I would have preferred the setting stay true to the story. That being said, if you like Offenbach, you should like this. There is some very familiar music, including the famous ""Can-Can."" One prominent stage device is the arrival of an old-fashioned locomotive in Hades. Very loud and very cute. I cannot help but note that in Offenbach's ""La Belle Helene"" (his take on the Judgment of Paris and the abduction of Helen by Paris), Paris solves a riddle which also involves ""locomotive."" Whatever can all this mean? On the whole, I like both the music and wit of ""La Belle Helene"" more than that of ""Orpheus in the Underworld,"" but ""Orpheus"" is very entertaining."
1,worst DVD ever?,"Beyond belief. So bad it just lays there. How could anyone ever produce, film or release this mess on DVD? Poor Offenbach. The Kent Nagano ""Tales of Hoffman"" was awful but nothing like this. The perfect gift for your worse enemy."
4,Good Basic Investing Information,"As the title would suggest, this is very basic investing information. If you are a new investor, and seek a very broad overview of investing, and your options, then this is the book for you. I bought this book for my mother, who has never invested outside of a savings account. I read the book to be sure it would give her the information I was hoping for. It was exactly what I wanted, written in easy to follow terminology. If you're an experienced investor, this book is not for you, however if you're seeking basic investing information, give it a read."
3,Classic,Still luv listening to Weird Al......it always brings a smile to my face and a laugh after each song
3,Pop goes Slowhand,"One of the many other fine compilations of recordings from Eric Clapton's 30-year plus recording career is titled simply ""Blues."" If the same logic had been applied to the naming of this collection, they would have called it ""Pop,"" because the 14 tracks included on this disc are too laidback, smooth, and bland to really be considered rock, and too polished-clean and adult contemporary-sounding to be considered blues. Don't get me wrong, there's some excellent musicianship on display throughout this ""chronicle"" of the latter years of EC's career, but though the net result is a collection that makes wonderful background music, those familiar with the best cuts from Clapton's solo electric blues-rock heyday, such as the original epic version of ""Layla,"" ""Cocaine,"" and ""I Can't Stand It"" won't be able to get through this disc with a certain longing for the good old days."
3,For Sentimental Clapton Fans,"As reviewers here state - this is not your guitar on fire Clapton collection. What it is: a post '80s collection of Clapton's assorted work. ""The Best"" or even ""Chronicles"" is somewhat misleading although there are certainly some strong tracks here.I got this for ""Forever Man"" and ""Change the World"" - two great Clapton tracks. ""Before You Accuse Me"" and ""It's In the Way that You Use It"" are cool too. Other tracks blend in well but some songs like ""(I)Get Lost"" and ""Blue Eyes Blue"" are pretty uncharacteristic of Clapton and will surprise long time followers. I seriously doubt their merit in being included in any best-of collection...certainly not songs that any Clapton fan will remember in his legacy.That said, this is not a collection for vintage Clapton fans. It's more of an above average sampler - not a representative retrospective. Other recent collections and albums have him exploring his roots. This is more of a glossy summation."
5,Golden Eric Clapton!,Eric Clapton is such a talented and feeling musician and it shines through in his work. Some of his music even brings a tear to my eye (Tears In Heaven) and evokes the sensitive guy in me. Change The World really moves me. The rest of the songs are really good too. Don't miss out on this album. Get it!
3,This isn't all there is to Clapton,"This short disc of puffy hits seeks to re-position Eric not as a guitar god, but as an MOR crooner.Granted, he's had his soft hits, but his career and reputation hasn't been made there. But Warners seems to have decided that, yeah, he plays a mean guitar but he's really an easy listening singer. Which is like saying: sure, Einstein was a whiz at that math stuff, but did you ever taste his strudel?To drive home the point, the liner art is full of photos of Clapton with an acoustic guitar...not a Stratocaster in sight. The real truth is shown on the portrait found on the traycard: Clapton wincing with an ""I-smell-excrement"" look. Exactly my reaction.The legacy of Eric Clapton is his prowess on guitar - and you'll find little of it here. So if you like your Clapton light and puffy, fine, but this is NOT Eric Clapton."
2,Terrifically competent wallpaper from a former god,"There's no doubt that Eric Clapton is one of the best pop guitar players of the recorded era. Nor can there be any denying that at the height of his first era popularity, the music he recorded was also first rate. But in the mid '70's Eric tasted gold with a series of mid-tempo tasteful but frequently less than tasty albums, which served as a template for all that has come since. Though an occasional flash of brilliance shines through, the '80s and '90s music documented here makes for better dinner party wallpaper and beer commercials than anything else. Perhaps worst of all is the lifeless acoustic remake of Layla, which sucks all the life out of the raging original. In the end, this music is not offensive. Which, when you think about it, coming from someone with Clapton's obvious talents, is in itself offensive.dap"
5,VHS That Forsythe Woman,The VHs although a used video had no flaws throughout and the color was excellent. I wouldn't hesistate to purchase a used video from this company in the future.
1,Puerile.,"The dust cover says it is elegant writing. Technically, perhaps. I found the plot and story and details absolutely puerile. I ordered the book because I read all things bush/Cheney, trying to get a clue as to whatit was that made them tick. Scooter Libby was one of those things. Scary."
1,"Bear with me a second, Scooter","Scooter, we will miss you behind the big granite walls, but hopefully now that you have given up your government job for a future career as a - well, let's not go into that just now. Just keep in mind that the important thing now is that you can focus on your best skill: developing ground-breaking, tawdry fiction.Admittedly, there is not much new under the sun. We've seen and heard so much in this informational age. The first atomic bomb -yes, that was plowing new ground, as indeed man's first steps on the moon. But in ""The Apprentice,"" Scooter has moved on toward new horizons and, thanks to his vivid mind, given us something truly new - lascivious bears with a yin for young girls, thus rendering them frigid. Now, admit it, you will not find that plot line in any other volume you have crossed. My hat's off to you Scooter. You have taken the written word to a new low point. Gutenberg would be proud.Bears and little girls. Yes, you will find prison fun. Do write!"
2,OK but not great.,"It's an original for sure. I was a little disappointed with the character development. Not as strong as say Chetan Dave (Datoga Island) or Michael Crichton (Rising Sun) in terms of Far East suspense novels. If you have read everything on your list and want to try something a little far out i.e. experimentation, you can give this a shot. Unfortunately this may sell just because of the author's name being in the media for other reasons."
3,Disappointing work,"Former Wall Street Journal writer Faludi's treatise on how Ronald Reagan is personally responsible for the backlash against women. Faludi somehow never seems to explain that Reagan appointed more females than his predecessors, or how female-owned business startups far outnumbered those of men during his term, or how one senile old man could personally influence thousands of male bosses. I found the book anecdotal, not journalistic."
4,Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women,"This book is a little dated, but some of the things are going on against women as they are today. It was published in the early 1990's. I especially like the fact that she goes into detail about this backlash by setting chapters aside for movies, TV, etc. If you desire to read a meaty book about feminism, this one will tempt you and will be great reading."
2,Women Don't Need Men,"For all you fathers out there who have had to fight with the tenacity of a pit bull for a modicum of visitation rights with your own kids, it may seem difficult to understand how feminists could be so livid - and so full of hate. I speak not only for myself, but for male friends, co-workers, and family members who have lost their homes, a good percent of their income, and have been told by their ex-spouses, girlfriends, and the court just how little time they may spend with their own children.It seems men are just a gang of aggressive tyrants. Of course, they are certainly convenient when it comes to fathering children and paying the bills, aren't they! I find the book to be a declared war against men. I wish a feminist could experience what it feels like to be a disenfranchised father, with the unspoken cultural belief that you're not a man if you show your hurt. Men are taught to hide their feelings and keep quiet about such things. I think it's time we start to speak out."
5,Fabulous Unfolding,"This is such a wonderfully researched and recounted book and, with ""The Beauty Myth"", got me into feminism. In chapter after chapter, Susan Faludi takes the way we have thought things are and turned them around to show what was really going on behind the scenes. Her writing style is very personally engaging. The chapter on ""Fatal Attraction"" has stayed in my mind for the 5 years since I first read the book. My favourite book of non-fiction."
5,Class Act All The Way!,"Vonda Mills wrote a review not even worth reading.She evidently doesnt have a clue.This performance is Spectacular and there is nothing pathetic about the 80's.The music scene was so inventive and diverse,a time period which will be truly missed.Rick rips through all his greatest hits with bursting energy and his backing band is top notch.The video effects are cutting edge for the time.Rick was and always will be a pop rock icon."
5,Go back in time and enjoy the ride!,"Being a young Puerto Rican in the US, this is the CD that keeps me going on when living so far from my island. I have 5 CDs from the Sonora, and this is one of the best. This CD has the best songs recorded by the Sonora, including a well-blended mix of different genres: cha cha cha, mambo, son, and the good old boleros romaticos del ayer! Most of the songs are by the original singers. These are the songs my parents grew up litsening to, and I know all the songs by heart. I certainly recommend this CD to anyone who loves good old latin music."
3,"ex militant claus, in a depression","Theres a lot about this album I find intriguing. Yes, sure, maybe the lyrics arent as defined as some other Leae releases. Yeah, sure, maybe Its constructed from a simple pattern, and yeah, sure, maybe it isnt as aggro as most people have come to expect from claus. But if he did what we were expecting, wouldnt that be boring? I think this album has a very somber flowthrough, occasionally touching extremely gothic edges, which i normally dislike. Some was a tad to resemblant to crap rocker trendy razor, but it is what it is. The sequel to legacy, a continuous self expression project alering the emotions of what claus' life holds. It goes though a series of emotions...from angry to depressed, to let down to rememberance...It isnt as bad as people who have this pre conception on what it should be has made it sound."
5,A Great Find,"Was looking for a set of Monsoon (why did they go away ?) speakers to match a set on another computer. Found these on Amazon, price seemed fair, so decided to give them a whirl. Surprised a what great shape they were in, almost new. One very happy camper now !"
1,Floridaconsultant,"First time your mistake; second time mine. I have now used the Wilson/Thornton tutorial for two training sessions, and will never use it again. The format and layout is good, but the errors that should have been caught & corrected have enough of an impact upon learners that it should not be used, particularly for anyone at the beginning level, even though the book is marketed as a tutorial for beginners. Macromedia should be informed of the negative impact this book has upon AW. In the last training session I had one trainee have the IT person from where she works help her ... and he couldn't believe the errors found in the middle and later chapters. The trainee gave the book back to me and said she would never use AW again!Enough said."
5,A Great Start for Beginners,"As a wine-lover in early training, I find this book helpful and quite entertaining to read. Like many who have posted comments here, I think this is a great start to LEARN about wines. It's refreshing to see the authors take an unique approach towards such a seemingly ""over-written"" subject by including some interesting conversations/interviews with winemakers as well as chefs. Oftentimes this type of books tend to lecture on what we should/or should not like. This book, however, is refreshing in that it is NOT judgmental. It simply lays out an guideline which allows me to enhance my own wine and food pairing experience. After all, wine tasting is very PERSONAL. Highly recommended."
2,tailbone agony,"It could be that all pilates would cause this type of pain if you have a history of a cracked tailbone, but I was very dissappointed that 95% of this tape you spend on you tailbone. I tried it once and never again!"
4,as advertised,Product was a replacement for one that was lost. Obviously liked it enough to re-purchase it. Took over 3 weeks to receive it - thought that was a long time.
5,Great work out,"This video is a great work out, but it doesn't mean you can go and eat anything and everything you desire. You still have to watch your intake of calories. This video was a great first time video for me."
4,Use it or loose it,"Between trying to loose weight and turning 60 and wanting to keep flexible...a friend introduced me to this and I got one for myself. Use it every other day and feel that it does not only work up a sweat but it also works hips, knees, arms, etc. So it works for me!!!"
3,"Good book, but....","Plato's Republic is a classic work, but it shouldn't be the only book you read to understand who Socrates was and what he taught. I suggest reading this book, which includes the Republic and other works about Socrates: Searching For Socrates: Ancient Texts About The Great Philosopher (Illustrated). It's also less expensive."
3,Weak,These worked good for about 1 session before they broke. I wouldn't buy again. I didn't notice too much a difference.
2,Cracked the first month!,"Received the drum sticks for a birthday present. They do cut down the vibration which is great, and give more movement capabilities. But, the sticks cracked with in the first month that I had them, and the ink ran all over the sticks!I called Zildjian directly, and was told since the center of the stick is hollow, only use the tips, not the other ends of the sticks. I am sending sticks back to Zildjian for a replacement. Also They are not very phone friendly. I love Protec, they wear like iron!"
1,Words cannot describe how bad this is . . .,". . . But I'll give it a try. ""Descent Part II"" has all the faults of Part I, and then some. To an utterly stupid storyline, bad directing, and a lack of suspense and the necessary epic feel, Part II adds gratuitous cameos, a nonsensical storyline of Dr Crusher commanding the Enterprise (wasting heaps of time that could have been used to far better purpose), and - YET AGAIN - a ""no consequences"" conclusion. Many of these problems stem from the fact that Part I and Part II were written by different people, I suspect. The one good point is Brent Spiner - he does a scarily good job as Lore, now driven by a sense of destiny as well as his own superiority. But can anyone explain to me why Data can execute his brother and Dr Crusher can disobey an order, and neither are ever punished?"
1,Too Scary,"Let your children read these books.. if you want to scare the crap out of them. I read these books when I was younger and they scared me to death. The illustrations were the worst part... those images stay in your mind. I am 21 now and I still remember these stories even though I haven't picked up one of these books since I was twelve. If you don't want your child waking you up in the middle of the night telling you that they can't sleep, DO NOT let them read these books."
4,Great Introductory Books for Scary Stories as an Oral Story Telling Tradition! Classic for a Reason,"My opinion of Scary Stories 3: More Tales to Chill Your Bones is about the same as the second (and first for that matter). The pictures remain the most disturbing aspect of the book...the rest makes a fine initiation for young readers into creepy, scary, spine-tingling urban legends, tales of terror, ect... I'm glad to be done with the series and while Girl isn't ready for these yet (she's basing not wanting to read it on the pictures alone), I'll happily check them out for her (or buy a boxed set) when the time comes (and I'm sure it will). I think once she gets past the pictures, she'll have no problem with the text, there's nothing she hasn't really encountered in one for more another in her reading or TV watching over the last 9 years...and since we frequently watch shows about urban legends and ghosts, I doubt much here will shock or upset her. Three stars for this one too."
5,SCARY THE POOP OUTTA ME,the story Harold scared me so bad...to this day if i think of the ending for 2 long i get chills...it is a fantastic read regardless...i suggest reading it yourself before you pass it on to your children NOT for young kids
1,Poor quality,A few years ago these used to last a long time. Now you get a week or two and that's it. Avoid.
4,Great way to buy. Product is ok.,"If you are buying this product, it is because you have the handle to go with it. In that case, buying on Amazon is definitely the way to go. However the quality of the product is not exemplary. It is fine, not great."
5,best yet!,"This is by far the best router we have ever had. It was extremely easy to set up with our ibook, powerbook and imac, and wireless canon printer. We have not had to reset it even once. Prior to buying the Airport Extreme Base Station we had a belkin router which had to be reset at least daily and eventually overheated and stopped working all together (and it behaved even worse when we were running our old Dell desktop PC). We are about to get a pc laptop (reluctantly) for business since we don't want to defile our macs with windows. I expect to be able to set that up to work with the Airport just as easily, but will add to this review if their are any surprises."
2,Price is crazy,"You can't remote manage this thing, it doesn't have 1000Mb ports. Find another product."
2,Not ready for prime time,"I bought this Airport Extreme to bump up the speed of my network, but also to complement the two Airport Express devices that I own. The Extreme worked well for the first (my network seemed slightly faster), but failed MISERABLY on the second point. This product is completely incompatible with the Airport Expresses, despite what Apple's website says.I highly recommend that anyone looking to buy this go to the Apple support discussion forum first and look for people who have tried to use it the same way you did. Otherwise, you're going to be stuck with a very expensive paperweight."
1,poor functionality,"the software vendor pretends to offer a demo/trial version of software, but when trying to download it keeps providing only a series of screenshots. so customer can't try it.turned out very poor software.OCR quality is very low.The best OCR quality i've seen was on the Canon's CanoScan software that comes with their scanners."
1,Piece of junk,This the worst oxo product I have ever purchased. The sponge tears off after few uses with little pressure. Obviously no one ever tested this product in actual use. Very disappointing!
4,Good Golf book.,"I am glad I learned of this book...it allowed to eliminate the multitude of swing thoughts etc. which were leading to 'paralysis by analysis'. If this sounds like you, the book may be helpful. The swing proposed by Knudson, is rather simple, as explained by other reviewers; basically, hands remain passive while weight transfer and balance drive everything. The swing itself is now a lot more enjoyable for me. There is some repetition in the book, and reading about Knudson's time on tour is rather boring. The 150 page book could be compressed in less than half that; regardless, worth going through the whole thing to change your swing."
5,A must-read for rescued animal adopters.,"Even though this is a children's book, I cried when I read this. It is a great story with a very happy ending. The pictures are the best part because they are so cute! I wish every shelter dog would end up like little Boyd-Friend."
5,"Loved this movie, some people are too critical.","If your a sci-fi fan, you'll like this one. It's fun. I feel people are being way too hard on this film. It's no masterpeice, but I liked it. Bai Ling is fantastic and super sexy. It's action packed. I liked it alot."
3,OK For A Rental.,"I rented this from Family Video last night. It was ok. It is what it is. If you go into this expecting anything spectacular you'll be disappointed, because this is a straight to video release.The acting was decent, the visuals were average, but the action was lacking. I was bored for the majority of viewing. Faye Dunaway was a total throw away character in the film. What a waste of a talented actress. However, Bai Ling is pretty good. Without her this movie would have nothing going for it at all. Really, everything here in this cyberpunk/cyberfunk world has been done before and better (Blade Runner anyone?). Yet, it was still better than most of the movies shown on Sci-Fi. Rental movie only."
2,Combichrist yes...The Gene Generation no.,I rented this DVD from Hastings last night because I heard that the techno/industrial band (COMBICHRIST) did the music for the movie. There is indeed a cool music video for COMBICHRIST but as for the actual movie........yawn. This is a low budget sci-fi thriller with goofy charachters and cheap CGI. I found the movie to be dull and I couldn't even bare to watch it all the way through. Nothing special here...just another cruddy movie that will eventually go out of print or sell for a penny at a garage sale. Lame! I'm only giving it two stars because I didn't finnish the movie and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that it had something entertaining at the end...seriously...a bad flick.
3,Not there best stuff,"As with Tyranny of Inaction, this CD captures Rosetta Stone after they switched over to rather bland industrial music. This is too bad, as in there first several releases they could do no harm. Unlike Tyranny of Inaction, this CD does have a few decent cuts, in particular a cover of Venus in Furs. 96.6 Before Dawn isn't that bad either. If you came looking for songs like Adrenaline or Subterfuge, you may be let down. Some of the remixes (Adrenaline in particular) sound like they are played on a cell phone."
2,I've tried to read this book three times...,"and finally gave it away. While I think it's a great concept, I don't find it a page turner, or enough to make me care about any of the three characters Ms. Hager Cohen follows throughout the book."
3,Exagerated logo is misleading,"The Fanmats 5869 are nylon-pile carpeted fabric which won't hold up as long as other burber fabric or better material. Despite the picture shown, the team logo is not as large on the product I received as it appears on the display."
4,"Outstanding info, but a tedious read","Contains a wealth of detailed info about electric kiln construction and usage, and about how to mix and use clays and glazes. The editor should have done a better job, because the wording is sometimes awkward and tedious, but it's still a good reference book containing very valuable information. Also has many excellent photos of finished work, as well as side essays about individual ceramists."
3,Very Picky About Positioning,"These speakers have a very tiny sweet spot, and if you accidentally stray out of it, you lose your mid/high ranges.They're on their way back....I took the plunge on a pair of Klipsch Promedia 2.1s, simply awesome. But, the price is a major drawback."
5,"Great- Very funny, entertaining, and the music is good","I really liked Bad Hair Day, though all the hype over ""Amish Paraadise"" I thought was strange. Sure, it's a good song, but I liked ""Everything you know is wrong"", ""The night Santa went crazy"", and other songs better. Over all, it is a great CD, a good sample of WALY (Weird AL Yanchovic) if you haven't heard him before, and it really isn't very offensive to very many people, I would think, except, of course, the Amish. Who have been selling crack, importing pot into Canada, and killing. Not really much of a paradise anymore..."
4,Different,I bought this cd for my 14 year old son as he watched a weird al video and loved the take off on the songs. I listened to it (don't tell my husband or son hehehe) and it is rather interesting.
5,"this is one of his top albems . the topsong is ""phony calls""","the top song's on this CD are ""Iam so sick of you"" and ""Amash paradise"""
5,A classic from the Master,"This is one of the best things Weird Al has done. Amish Paradise and Gump are 2 great songs, but The Night Santa Went Crazy WILL BE everyones favorite Christmas song from now until the end of time! Anyone that even remotely likes Weird Al will LOVE this!"
1,He's Not Funny Anymore,"Previously known for h is gross out comedies, here a Twist on Coolio's Gangster's Paradise sees Al becoming an Amish Rhabbi seriously. The rest of the album isn't funny either. The record company said they were trying tyo make Al less like a geek, and instead he became an Amish icon. If he would've done this from the beggining, he would be the main guy in music right now. They were sent in to clean up this gangster stuff, which they got accused of being Gangsters themselves. Because it was played on MTV in the days when it was still music video oriented."
5,U.S. version is excellent,"I believe that this is the U.K. version of the book, and I'm sure it's excellent too. However, U.S. readers should search for ""I'm Pregnant"", also by Lesley Regan."
1,NO HANDLE,ORDERED THIS HANDLE FROM (BEST PRICE MIRROW )1/26/2011(((((( HAVE NOT RECIVED ORDER AS OF 4/5/2011 )))))))
1,Do not buy this product!!,"This product has been horrible. I have been on the phone with tech support for hours and they now want me to send it to them because ""it doesn't work"" they claim. What a nightmare and so many precious wasted hours! Don't get this product! Stay away..."
1,D.O.A.,"Item arrived with dead batteries, Will cost more than its worth to replace the batteries since they are not a common size. Even though it was fairly inexpensive, it would have been nice have something like that work when You get it."
3,Edix jail tower,"This is a beautiful looking wooden tower, all hand painted. In my opinion, it is not suitable for real play. Its roof pieces come off (fly off) often, and the gate would be easily broken.Also, know that this is part of a castle set, so the tower does NOT stand alone. It has no floor; and it must be propped up in back to stand level."
4,Nice Overview of the Relevant Issues,"This book is a terrific overview of the questions concerning the ULTIMATE SOURCE of moral values. Have values developed as part of human socio-cultural evolution? Are they nothing but the outer manifestation of the innerworkings of ""selfish"" genes? Is ""morality"" just a particular type of discourse used for conveying personal emotions about certain activities? Or do they arise from our ""intuitions of the divine?"" (Or perhaps some combination of these?). Highly recommended for anyone interested in current trends within the science/religion dialogue, and anyone interested in evolutionary psychology."
2,Let Down,"The past Lips albums have always been jaw droppers. New sounds and soundscapes. This album is kind of wack. It's better than most albums to come out htis year, but for the Lips it is a piece of pooh pie. There are some good moments, but it just sounds like something that could have fit into Yoshmi or Soft Bulletin. A dissapointment. But not he worst. I guess I would have to say that there is not a thread that holds the album togeather that makes it a ""whole piece"" with a vison, like their last 6 or seven albums.so pick it up, it won't kill ya. But it definetly won't blow your mind. Like the Lips should.I'm sure these songs sound great in concert.Lips concerts are the bomb.This album, though, sadly, is not.It's a poof..."
3,Less lingering,"Creative strain can be heard in some crude implementations of melody and druggy effects, resulting in less memorable music. If only unable to compete with their last two fantastic outings, the entire package-particularly the first side-flows well enough to produce another agreeable neo-psychedelia entry."
3,"It's no ""Soft Bulletin""","This album, like it's predecessor ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots"" has the same fantastic production & unique arrangements of the band's 1999 masterpiece ""The Soft Bulletin."" However, to me, the songs aren't nearly as strong. In fact, it heads in the direction of bands like Elbow & Super Furry Animals, laden with nifty sound effects & arrangements but with songs that don't stick with you at all.If you agree that ""Yoshimi"" was just ""Soft Bulletin"" lite, then don't bother with this one - at least ""Yoshimi"" had 1 or 2 great songs.But if you loved ""Yoshimi"", you'll probably like this, too."
5,Mark Lowry DOES have a serious side and this is the result!,"If you have ever wanted to hear the serious side of Mark Lowry this is the album for you. It contains a peppy ballad ""Being Happy"" which includes backup vocals by the Gaither Vocal Band. Another good pick is the old Rusty Goodman tune ""Look For Me"" which is a duet with His mother Beverly. ""A House of Gold"" is also a favorite which features Michael English and his vocal flip-flops. Also featured are the Martins on ""Farther On Down The Road"" and Vestal and Howard Goodman on ""I Can't Even Walk"". So all in all this is a must for any Mark Lowry or Gaither Homecoming Fan."
2,Not too good...get the originals,I was pretty disappointed with a lot of the tunes on this box set: many sound like sound checks or rehearsal space jams that go on a lot longer than they should. There are a few good tracks sprinked throughout. Alien Panetscapes is a standout - but I played bass with this group for a few months (not on this lineup) so I am biased ;-).For some mind expanding sounds:space rock:GongHawkwindOzric Tentacles (sp?)Alien PanetscapesElectronica from the 60's and beyond (academic sound):Ilhan Mimaroglu - Wings of the Delerious DemonMorton SubotnickPauline OliverosMilton Babbitt - Philomel...
2,Only shows central Denver.,"This map shows most of the city of Denver. It goes east to Quebec St, missing Lowry Field. It goes south to Evans, missing the parts of Denver south of Evans. It shows none of the suburbs around Denver. The scale is 1 inch = 0.50 miles."
1,Do not...repeat...do not bother!,"It is not often that I offer a negative review but this compilation while attractive does not deliver at all.The foot massage gizmo is awkward and uncomfortable.The pumice stone leaves rough splinter like skin.The foot scrub doesn't reall scrub.The rotary action tool has five heads, none of which work well and you must hold the switch in place or it turns off. It is cumbersome and ineffective.The one star was initially given for a foot brush (which later lost its bristles very easily as I update the review) and a sweet smelling foot repair balm.Don't waist your money. Soak your feet and invest in an inexpensive German Titania file, smooth and coarser side, or a like product. It will last for years."
4,"Polaroid ""Joycam""",Hi!... I rate this item 4 stars because i feel taht since this item has no customer review they must think it's very bad. I think that if you are the type of persont aht loses EVERYTHING then this is the thing for you. you can NOT lose this...it its impossible. it's bulkyness combined with it's insistant whining after taking a picture can remind you of it's place. thank you for reading!
3,Worth it but not an epic,"This being one of the most exciting cars of the past 10 years, one would expect a better production to befit the title. Its not really a comprehensive ""story"" of the Impreza but a collection of interesting bits of video and examples of the car. Some ""talky"" interviews with Prodrive chiefs and engine mod specialists are of interest but overlong. The footage of the legendary 22B model are enticing. Enthusiasts will like it, as there is very little else by way of DVD choices, but those with a passing interest need not bother. I am glad I bought it, but I also love the car."
5,This deserves to be updated and re-published.,"Mr Hedges wrote a very detailed account of the band here, so much so, that one can feel that he was really connected with the bandmembers. There are many upon many quotes from the band in here that really give more depth than I have seen in recent documentaries. I can't believe I spent the amount of money I did for it, but I just couldn't find a copy and other Yes fans have praised it. I agree with the reviews. It's funny where the book finally ends up at and that is the departing of Rick and Jon from the band. The Drama album was actually very good in my opinion and fresh at the time. I still would like to see an updated version of this book, or a bandmember account of being in Yes."
5,Best collection of its kind,"A fabulous collection for professors, students, and amateurs alike. More concise than others out there without sacrificing the breadth and importance of the readings. Editors' introductions are extremely helpful in placing each reading in context. A must-have for evey music lover."
2,Misleading ISBN,"This product came up when I searched for the ISBN of the new edition, but instead is was the old edition!"
5,Child's Learning Tool . . .,. . .my grand daughter loves to learn from this CD . . . she has so much fun . . .she doesn't realize just how much she's learning . . . but her parents sure do!
4,Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research,The four rating is because of this book -- although a good and informative read -- is boring. This is because I often find myselft struggling with sleep while working to understand and absorb content.The authors would be well advised to find a way to present this content in a way that inspire students to continue reading to the end of the text.
5,Guidance for everyday life,This is a work which provides guidance for everyday life by revealing the fundamental values given in the Jewish religion. Rabbi Jacobs is one of the great teachers of Judaism in the twentieth century and has contributed much to increasing understanding of it. This work is written with the kind of learning and modesty ( walking humbly with one's God) that are fundamental Jewish values.
5,Effective and startling,"This show is a bleak and straight forward glimpse into the lifes, minds and activities of contemporary neo-nazis, and some people affected by them. A powerful and simple show, but a challenge for all involved. It is dedicated to one of the victims."
4,"Great story to have in French, but cheap edition","In general, I am not a big Eric Carle fan. Some of his books I do not care for at all, while others I do like. This one, however, I think is wonderful. It is my favorite of his books. I like how it incorporates the days of the week, different foods, and the life cycle of a caterpillar. I like that my toddler can learn all these things in French, and he likes being able to put his little fingers through the holes made by the hungry caterpillar. I think this is a GREAT book to have in one's French children's library. The only thing keeping me from rating it five stars is the quality of the binding. It appears to be very flimsy/cheap, and I seriously wonder how long it would last if I allowed my three-year-old to look at it on his own. I really wish Amazon would offer this classic in hardcover, or at least in a better quality paperback."
2,Nice as a one season sheet set,"I have to admit that I love this set. Especially since I found it hard to find white flannel sheets. Most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen! So when I found these and at this price I was quite happy. They feel great, not the best flannel but nice all the same. But after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore. Later the fitted started getting holes. So since this was rather cheap I am not horribly sad about it. So if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning, this is the set for you!"
2,Never in focus,"I know this camera is convenient but the pictures are never sharp. I have used it for a year. I wish I had spent a little more to get a quality 35mm. I plan to replace it with a digital model at greater expense. At least I won't lose the cost of film & developing, approx $15 a roll."
2,Flash,"I loved the size of the camera, but that has its flaws. A constant problem was red eye. Even with the red eye reduction, it was quite prevalent. I believe, from what I have read, the flash is too close to the lens."
2,Someone loves themselves a bit too much.,"I'll preface this with an admission - I am not a designer. I am an engineer by degree, having never actually practiced as one. I find the arts brilliant, each artist exposing themselves in the art they create.In regards to this book, there were quite a few sections that were brilliant. The paragraphs on defining a home were fantastic - I even wrote up that segment and sent to quite a few of my friends.Where this book fails, for me, is the extreme self-indulgence of the author. I'm a fan of elitism - we should be as elite as we can possibly be. That word is nice. But there is elitism, and then there is the self-love that this book is all about. The whimsical writing contrasts heavily with her judgementalness and her own severe issues.For every 2 times I quoted the book in a positive nature, I found myself quoting double the amount of passages in a ""jeez, someone is full of herself"" manner. That sums it up best for me."
4,Good movie!,"I liked this movie a lot, I'm a 'sucker"" for a love story! I didn't view it as an i/r love story, but as two lonelypeople finding each other! I thought her character was a little mean to him, but I guess it was her way of dealingwith her situation! But I cried when she passed away, the scenario was so realistic!! I recommend it!"
3,Could have used 200 more pages,"This book could have used 200 more pages, to give the author more chance to share the deeper feelings of the characters with us. Matthews other books allowed us into the soul of every character who even as much as passed through the scene. So I'm sure that in this case, it was probably some reason I can't imagine that the book appeared far too short, and left me feeling that with the extremely interesting moral dilemma she explored, there was a lot more she could have told us about."
5,Very nice,This was shipped promptly and the screen printing was accurate to the original painting. I bought this to go with the Lester's Ammo sign they are a great parity together.
5,Great,"I bought the book for my son. My son loves the book; it is full of great recipes that are easy to follow. I don’t' know how authentic it is, but the ladies at the Korean Market when we were buying the ingredients for the recipes recognized the dishes we were going to make."
4,Very informative on Islam,"In this book, Hal uses scripture and other sources toillustrate the foundational reasons for Islam's view of""conversion by force"".Very interesting read."
5,Great book that everyone should read,This is a terrific book which put modern Islamic Jihad in a historical perspective. Many Americans and Europeans do not understand the real history of Islam and theroots of Jihad. Hal Lindsey provides great insight into why we face the current titanic struggle against those who do not seek peace. This book will make you thinkand will open your eyes. I read it in two days and then my wife read it. We are going to pass the book on to family and friends.
1,I have a challenge for you,Instead of going to secondary sources about Islam like this book written by a religious bigot named Hal Lindsey. Why don't you just read the Koran and know for sure what muslims and Islam really stand for.
4,An accurate account,"As a Muslim from Ankara who is disgusted with years of Islamic indoctrination, I must assert that much of what is written in this book is accurate. Particularly the exposition of the later Suras (which are quite bigoted, violent, and narrow minded) through which the earlier texts of the Quran are to be understood. As far as any apocalypticism is concerned, let that be left to the theologians to figure out. Anyone who has lived in a Muslim Society knows oppression not unlike that experienced by those living under the Iron Curtain. Don't be fooled."
3,Not a bad book but not my favorite,I was actually a little disappointed in this work from Hal Lindsey. The main problem I had was that it became somewhat boring in places especially when he was giving the history of the Muslims. Sometimes too much detail can actually distract from a book such as this.There were some good parts but not anything I had not read (much easier) in other works.
2,"Too expensive, too short, same old-same old stuff","This book has a lot of so-called energizers which have appeared in one form or another in 30 other books on the same topic. There's nothing fresh about this approach and the textbook manufacturer has, as usual, priced this way beyond its worth.skip it."
5,Waste King 1 hp,My second WK disposal unit. Very reliable and quiet. 121.00 was a half the cost of my first unit some 12 years ago. Don't waste time and money with another brand. Sinkairator and Sears are other brands that have failed me. Steve
2,Plastic and flimsy,"I bought this because Consumer Reports rated it highly. My plumber went to install it today, and said that he'll never install it again. It's plastic (instead of stainless steel) and flimsy, and a pain to install. He said that Insinkerator is a much better brand.It's a good reminder to let the trade professionals buy the fixtures and equipment -- they'll select the ones that are good, simple to install, and won't require callbacks on warranties."
3,Do it Yourselfer + 1 on Installation,"Product looks to be of good soild quality and function(hence 5 stars),but during installation using the EZ-mount system, it is anything but. Getting the unit properly aligned and seated to the cushion mount on sink is more than a chore with 2-people. The cushion mount needs to be compressed enough and aligned to allow the mount ring to secure the proper connection to sink. With a 2-drain sink, no room left for your regular garbage container either."
1,Lost parts,I still have not received the items I ordered necessary for hook up. I've been waiting for a good bit. I was told over the phone they would be here by Jan 15 Thanks
1,Arrived Broken,"I had read wonderful reviews and ordered the Waste King to replace our leaking Badger 5. There were two problems. My Badger was connected electrically directly to the electrical line. No plug. The Waste King came with a corded plug and required a regular outlet. I don't know if you can order it that way, but check before you order online. There was no way to use the one I ordered without cutting the cord and voiding the warranty. The other problem was that the Waste King arrived with some serious cracks around the base. Looked like it had not been packaged well. In fact, the Waste King box arrived loose in a bigger box with no packaging. The GOOD news is that return and refund procedure was very easy and I was not charged for the return postage. Wish it had worked out better."
3,works great but opening much too small,"well, I must say we have only had this for 2 months, but so far it grinds up anything put in -- no problem. the trouble is the opening is smaller than any other that we have owned, I find it a BIG ANNOYANCE that I cannot reach in and retrieve objects from the disposal myself!!!!!! and if anything ever falls down into the disposal I will not be able to retrieve it myself as the opening is too small for my hand to fit through!!..............which means I will have to get one of my kids to do that..........not a great idea, I do wonder why this has this problem. I do have large hands ( which really stinks as I can't wear ladies gloves but mens med fits except I don't like mens gloves!) but all the other disposal IN any other house I have lived it since childhood (that would be 7 )accommodated my large hands. AGAIN I find it a BIG ANNOYANCE that I cannot reach in and retrieve objects from the disposal myself!!!!!!"
4,Jam Free,"Jam-Free, Mess-Free FeedsThe Legend 8000 is a continuous-feed disposer, which means you can add waste while the unit runs. Stainless steel swivel impellers reduce jamming, and an easily removable. It does not hold a lot at one time but works well. It took a couple of days before it shipped. So far very happy with product."
5,A fine disposal at a discount price,"The Wasrte King L-8000 Legend Series 1.0 Horsepower Continuous Feed Garbage Disposal has met all of my expectations and then some. Not only is it able to do the job of grinding all of our soft organic items, but it is so quiet at times I wonder if it is really operating. After one month of ownership I am pleased. Ask me again in a year."
5,Good product,"This garbage disposal is Quiet and powerful. However, it is bigger than other products so make sure you measure before purchasing it. Overall, I am happy that I purchased it."
5,great,Very quiet and does a good job. The installation was a real hassel because I had hard wired my old one and had to install an outlet for this one. I should have just pulled the plug off this one and hard wired it as well.
5,This Disposer is Great!,It was easy to install. It took me longer to install the electrical outlet under the sink (the last disposal was hard wired) than it did to install the unit itself. The first time I ran it I thought that something was wrong. It sounded like it was stalled and I was just hearing the motor humming. I had to stop the water and pull the little rubber splash guard out of the sink to see that it was indeed spinning. This thing is so much quieter than the InSinkErator model that I had before. It seems to be very powerful as well. I haven't fed much through it yet but I feel pretty confident that it can handle anything that we can throw at it.
5,Great product,"Was easy to install, it's quiet and is a work horse. Can tell a big difference between the 1/2 horsepower one that we replaced."
4,Surprise.,Works great. Was surprised to find that it is designed to plug in rather than be hard wired. Had to get an electrician to change the connection so that my wall switch would work.
4,Good Unit,"I purchased this unit as it was recommended by Consumer reports and got a great price on Amazon. This was a replacement unit for a Kenmore waste disposal already installed. What I learned from changing brands is that the dimensions of the Waste King and the Kenmore are different and it was very difficult to realign the drainage pipes. Had to use a flexible discharge pipe to make connection to drain pipe. If I had it to do over again I would probably get the Kenmore unit so it would be a ""drop in"" and easier to install. If its a brand new install I would go with the Consumer Reports recommendation."
4,A plumbers opinion,"I like this product a lot, it works well and it has a great price; there are some flaws though. This thing is loud! Any Waste King product actually does everything the ads claim it does but it is very far from quiet, running this disposer is like having a jet engine running in your home. My description of the noise produced by this product may be an exaggeration but it gets the point across. At the same time I wouldn't think twice about installing this product in my home; it has power and I've NEVER seen one fail or been called out to a home where one has been installed because of a problem related to it, I've installed a lot of them over the past 17 years. If you use the 3 bolt adapter along with this disposer you can't find a better deal ISE (Emerson Electric) seems to have this market cornered but I really think that if you're looking for value you can't beat a 3/4 or 1 HP disposer from Waste King; 1/2 the cost, it chops waste finer and, you can't beat the warranty."
5,It just works!,I forgot about this because it does it's job trouble free. I never need to think about it. It just works without a hitch and chews through anything. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.
1,Misled,"I'm sure this a great product, although I was misled about the sink flange. It was to be stainless, it is chrome. I will have to order from after market company as Waste King does not have other colors for the EZ mount. The only one I can find to fit the Waste King disposal will cost almost as much as the disposal! Which brings up another issue, today five days after ordering the diposal Waste King direct lowers the price and yes, the flang does cost as much as the diposal."
4,compass,"bought this product for my husbands truck as his compass stopped working, he loves it now he has a clock, compass and temperature gauge in his vehicle, now all he needs is a new truck."
3,"No first 7""? Not Complete Decry!","I was about to buy this CD until I read the reviews. I was hoping to get the first 7"" on CD (or at least the original version of Falling). The version of Falling on their first album does not give justice to the original song! Oh well."
3,Rain drain OK,"Plastic thinner than I thought it would be, but easy to apply to downspout with the right connector. I expect that this will not last as long as thicker ones I've had in past, but it was a lot less expensive, so that's the trade-off."
2,The little drainspout that couldnt,"Doesnt work that great and is difficult to control... great concept, bad execution. Collapses and the water just collects in the tube. Not the greatest."
3,Another Vega CD Easy On the Ear,Nothing remarkable but several nice tracks. If you like Vega you will like this CD.
5,Rock In This Pocket.,"I have all five of Vega's cds and I think she was her most daring with 1992's 99.9F. She blended alternative electronic sounds into her music creating a kind of Nine Inch Nails/Vega sound. I like all of her work, but I think this is a classic cd along with 1996's Nine Objects of Desire. She really hit her stride here. Songs like ""Rock In This Pocket"", ""Blood Makes Noise"", ""99.9F"", ""In Liverpool"", ""If You Were In My Movie"" and ""As Girls Go"" make this a classic. This is a must have for any rock collector."
4,OttLite bulb,"Good price. Not as bright as original bulb, but then the old one doesn't work any more.I would order again."
4,excellent sotware,"this version of Vegas may not be the recent one, but the new ones don't have much more than 6. This is a great, east to use program, and for what I paid for it on Amazon, it was a steal. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I can't seem to use the capture mode."
2,Don't beleive the hype,This book was VERY disappointing. First of all the hard cover leads you to believe that the book is of a reasonable size. It's more like a Children book size. Many of the pictures are old and seemingly out of date. I was duped! I also bought his other book at the same time called Derriere and was equally disappointed. WATCH OUT and don't get duped like I did.
4,I LOVE Timon and Pumbaa!,"My favorite songs in Jungle Boogie are Yummy Yummy Yummy,Take Your Sweet, Sweet, Time and Stand By Me. Timon and Pumbaa are the PERFECT singing team! Take Your Sweet, Sweet Time is a terrific song that the Jungle Cubs(the Jungle Book characters when they were kids)perform. They tell you that it's great to be a kid, so ""let's do our growing up naturally."" Yummy, Yummy, Yummy is based on a song from the early 60's. It's perfromed by Timon and Pumbaa telling about their fave food: Bugs! Stand By Me is also based on a 60's song. It's also performed by Timon and Pumbaa(but mainly Timon). Timon is singing to tell Pumbaa that whenever he needs help, just ""stand by me""! Well, I guess I've been talking long enough. I know that if you buy this CD you will LOVE it! Bye-bye!"
2,Cut-down version of Boulder-Longmont map,"Rand McNally makes a map called ""Boulder & Longmont"" and another map called ""Boulder."" They're the same map, same scale, except that the Boulder map is cut smaller and just has Boulder and is laminated onto plastic. I guess this might be better if you never leave Boulder and are incapable of folding a map, but for the same price you might as well get ""Boulder & Longmont"" map. It's not a bad map but I was hoping to find a large-scale map showing more detail (and easier to read). The scale is one inch = 0.50 miles. It's frustrating that Amazon doesn't require that maps specify their scale before you buy them."
1,Very poor quality animation,This thing looks like it was made when computer graphics 1st came out. The quality is so poor and it's super annoying.
2,My toddler loves it . . . unfortunately.,"This is the most annoying video in our collection. It's not annoying in the way that Barney is annoying. It's annoying for its low production value and because it's utterly inane. Now I'm pretty forgiving of children's educational videos, but this one really drives me crazy. Let me give you an example. There's a running joke in the ABC section where the little boy character falls down (standing flat-footed on even ground, he inexplicably falls down). This running joke is repeated 26 times--once for every letter of the alphabet. My toddler tittered the first time this happened. But even that joke wore thin for him.The producers of this video should be forced to watch it scores of times, because that's what parents have to contend with. Other than that, my toddler loves this video. Loves it! Wants to watch it over and over and over! The horror!"
3,Handset is a white turd,"Handset and base are sturdily built, but even set at the highest volume it's still difficult to hear who you're talking to, and the sound is muffled, not very clear at all. Also, as is true of almost all cordless phones, each time you press a button it beeps. And with this phone those beeps are loud and can't be turned off. I called customer service to see if I could turn the beeps off and was told they can't be. Also, the batteries are the expensive battery pack type not AAA or AA, and they're Ni-Cad which are toxic to the environment. Don't know why they don't just supply NiMh. BTW, the light in the upper left hand of the handset does not stay lit or flash constantly as is the case with some phones which can be annoying. It only lights when the phone rings."
1,Buyer Beware,"I got this game thinking it would be fun, a street soccer game for the DS. But I was wrong. This game was without a doubt the worst game I had ever played, I was actually embarassed that I was a DS owner for a little bit. The game is very boring and repetitive and the touch screen didn't help at all. I only played this game for a short time before I quickly sold it. Please, if you want to begin a DS sports game collection, DO NOT get this game, you'll thank me for it later."
3,Relax...Enjoy the Sound,"I really enjoy this album. Being a long time fan of classical music, I enjoy the symphonic versions more. But at the same time I have absolutely no problem with trying new variations, especially of the electronic variety. It seems to me William Orbit is getting the same bad rap that Wendy (Walter) Carlos got years ago with her Bach recordings on the oh so sonorous Moog synthesizer. Relax people...just enjoy the ambience."
1,Oh Brother! :(,Terrible... just terrible. This CD is more or less murder of some fine classical music. And to think Orbit has done some very good work. But I guess all artists mess up now and then. Dont waste your money.
2,Great re-fill kit for a product that doesn't work.,"The refill kit is just fine.The problem is that the original product for which this kit is intended is a real dud!If you have the Clean/Repair machine and you like it, then fine. Go ahead and buy the refills.If you have not yet used the machine yet, then DO NOT waste your money on this refill kit until you discover how pooly the original machine performs!"
4,Review of Optifix pro refill kit,Works great at cleaning and repairing DVDs. Received on time with no problems. Would recommend this product to anyone who has the Optifix system.
4,Americana,"This is a part of our heritage as Americans. We all have some folklore that helps shape our lives and upbringings. It is the underlying history that does not get placed in the history books. We unfortunately do not teach this stuff in schools. America, being an extraordinary melting pot has a great diversity of tales to be told. This collection includes ballads, tall tales, fiddle tunes, childrens song and hymns. It is a quality overview of American folklore. It will set a yearning in your soul and make you wax nostalgic for lemon-ade and Tom Sawyer. This is a small chunk of what it means to be American."
1,General Hospital in Space,"If you're looking for good sci-fi, keep looking. If you're looking for a good drama, keep looking. This is a poorly written book. Recently, I've read some really good stuff and some bad, but this is terrible. There's no depth to the characters or the universe they exist in. It looks more like an outline to a novel than a novel."
4,"Slow Start, Picks Up Steam","It took me forever to pick this book up off my shelf, and several days to plow through the first 40 pages, but once Dr. Cherijoe Grey Veil makes planet fall at the colony where she will be a trauma doctor, the plot took off and I was hooked, reading the rest of the book in about a day. Cherijoe herself and a large cast of supporting characters are very well drawn and an action-filled space opera plot keeps things moving nicely. I'm going to be looking for the rest of this series!"
4,A nurse from Michigan 2-6-00,"Most enjoyable, enjoyed the medical aspect and she also portrays her characters well. I am looking for to the sequel this summer."
2,Treading into dangerous territory,"I was very surprised by the author's inclusion of rituals that seek to control or influence others. Rituals for exerting power over others? Breaking up a love relationship? These rituals go against both the Christian Golden Rule (Do unto others as you would have done unto you) and the Wiccan (Do as thou wilt and harm none)which the author so painstakingly sought to portray. Someone looking for knowledge, dark or light, will find what they're looking for here; I'm just saddened to think of those that will play with fire only to burn themselves and others."
3,"good for ideas, but...",An okay book but to rigid for my tastes. It doesn't explain candle magic rather it gives you stuffy spells to follow. Not what i'm looking for.
2,not for beginners,"This book is definitely not for beginners...and most of the candle burning rituals take many days...I was disappointed in this book, but maybe as time goes by and i become more experienced it might grow on me and become one of my go to booke for rituals."
1,Bremen Is A Gas,"I thought the German fellow might like to know that Sid was 21 at the time of his fatal OD, not 23. I'm sure this record is as musically compelling as he was accurate! Equally accurate, yet far more interesting (brilliant, really) is Alex Cox's film of Sid's rise and fall, ""Sid & Nancy"", a must see for all who came of age in the Punk Era."
3,Worst Flotsam & Jetsam album ever.....but it is still worth a listen,After two member changes and somewhat of a let down album('High') F&J release 'Unnatural Selection'. The best word to describe this album would be mediocre. With a new drummer and guitarist on board (who truly don't do a bad job) the album seems unfocused and boring at times. The arrangements are lacking and some of the pieces just don't fit. If you are expecting some masterpiece the guys are far from it. But there is certainly some good songs. Probably the best on the album that could remind fans of there earlier work would be the song 'Promise Keepers' a well put together song. Then there is 'F**kers' which has an interesting feel to it and 'Brain Dead' which I also enjoy. The rest just seem a bit generic and uninteresting. With that being said fans should leave this for last. And after owning there whole catalog this is by far there worst album but is still worth a listen or two.
3,Polaroid I-Zone Camara,"This camara was really fun to use and I had fun with it for a while. But unless you are living in a college dorm or somewhere else where you can use the pictures to do all the great stuff on the commercials,(Would anyone really do that anyway?)it is really no use. My camara also ran out of batteries very often, so all the pictures I took indoors, when the flash did not work, were ruined (plus the film is definetly not cheap). Don't get me wrong the camara is fun to use, but you need the right time to use it, or else you will end up with a pile of stickers sitting on the desk in your room, like me."
1,an excersise in futility,"Albeit Professor Gorodetsky wrote a book that is very interesting to read, and falls in-line with everything I learned in my schooling in Russia, there is one fact that I do not understand. He keeps relying on information he uncovered in ""secret Soviet archives."" Given the very nature of the Russian governement, given the fact that he is a jew, I would love for him to shed some light on the following:a) how did he manage to get in thereb) how did he manage to get out of Russia having been therec) how can he be still alive having information that will probably never see the light of day, and according to Gorodetsky himself, is still secret"
2,MACs of HELL,AppleTalk doesn't quite work as advertised.Tried several things but it won't detect it as the correct printer through appletalk. Works great with windows machines.
1,Didn't Work,"I followed the install instructions to the letter, but the install program started giving me an error that I couldn't get past. I downloaded the latest install from the Linksys web site and got past the point where I had been getting the error, but I couldn't get the print server to connect to my wireless network. When I had the print server connected to my network via an Ethernet cable, it detected the attached printer but couldn't even print a test page successfully. This product was a complete waste of time."
1,Stiffing Vista Users,"My print server is now useless, after upgrading to Vista, as Linksys evidently has no plans ever to support Vista with this product.I've purchased many Linksys products in the past, but I will think twice about ever doing so again."
1,"Junk. Didn't work with my multi-function, then died a little over a year later.","This was my first, and only, purchase of a Linksys product. I unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer, then hooked it up to another printer, only to have it die just out of warranty. A completely worthless piece of Chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer doesn't even stand behind it."
1,No support for vista,"Linksys offers no support for vista, nor do they plan to offer support in the future. Seems even they have given up on this product."
3,"Works decently, setup was easy","I was a little apprehensive about this one, due to the the comments here. I took the plunge after confirming that it would work with my HP 6540 printer. Setup was easy - but since I run WPA on the wireless side, hooking up to the wired side was a necessity for configuring it (of course - how would it know your key?)The quick start guide was passable, I ended up using the PDF version of the full manual instead.It does run very hot - but since everyone says this about them, I'm sure it's ""normal"". I'm currently trying to decide whether I will leave it on all the time, or keep the printer and printserver powered off until I need to print."
1,poor wireless support,"Very hard to configure - nowhere in the supplied documentation did it list the default password (admin), so I had to search on the web. Once configured it worked well wired, but it lacks WPA support and it doesn't seem to work when I have SSID Broadcast disabled on my router. I guess that's fine if you have an unsecured wireless network, but if you care about security you'll only use the wired Ethernet port, in which case you may as well get a cheaper wired-only one.UPDATE -- as others have noted, the (unreleased) 6047 firmware supports WPA."
2,"There aren't many other choices, so this will do (barely)...","This print server has a personality and life of its own. I have it hard wired to my main computer via a switch, and that works fine. But it drops connectivity with the remote computers for no apparent reason and at no predictable time interval. Power cycling the Print Server remedies the situtaion for a while, but I can be sure the connection will drop again soon. No computer is more than 30 ft from the Server, so there seems to be no excuse. The only good thing is that the kids' computers are the ones losing the connection, so I'm saving on ink $$!"
2,Excellent Design - (Except for tabs),"I did purchase this item for my point-and-shoot camera (2.5"" LCD) and it works very well in blocking the sun/glare from the screen. My only problem, and it's a big one, is that in removing the shade itself, when you don't need it is a nice little TAB arrangement (4 TABS, 2/top and 2/bottom) made of plastic. These little tabs actually broke off within 2 weeks of purchase. Not very reliable. These should be made of a stronger material so they don't break with normal use."
2,"Great idea, lousy quality","I loved the concept for this; a pop up screen for my digital camera. Next thing best to a viewfinder, right?Uh, right...so, against all the reviews who said there were major flaws, I bought this.I had this on my camera for *two* days before it broke.The adhesive is crummy, the sides are flimsy, the whole product is nothing less than shoddy. It's a shame, because it's such a good idea. I hope that Delkin can improve the quality if they make another version."
1,A Piece of Junk!,A week after I bought it one of the PLASTIC hinges broke. I can't belive they would manufacture this with plastic hinges! Don't waste your money.
3,If you absolutely can't stand music theory...,"This is the book for you. It introduces each note very slowly (there is only one scale, 6 open chords, and 3 power chords) and provides plenty of songs to give you a context for each note. The description is also misleading as you learn absolutely no blues scales or chords in this book (there are just a couple of songs) and don't even get me started on the puns. This could be a good book if you have no musical background and like playing simple songs more than learning new concepts but even then this book is light on the concepts and big on corny humor."
4,SOUL TO SOULS - NELSON RANGELL,"ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM, ALTHOUGH DESTINY IS STILL MY VERY FAVORITE OF HIS."
4,good clean fun....,"***A truly enjoyable read. Although these books are geared towards children, I find them to be a nice light feel-good story that soothes my soul. I enjoyed the television shows and I enjoy the stories written in book form just as much (if not more)."
5,Awesome,I love this CD. When my vehicle was broken into and I lost it I was very upset but then I found it online. It is the most relaxing and soothing CD I have ever come across.
3,strange landscape,"I'm not sure yet what I think of this album. Not what I expected.Sometimes I hear a song and think Wow, this is a cool mellow mood, then others are jazzy and spacey and for me disconnected from melody. THey seem very personal and he has a character that comes through clearly, but I'm more into melodies that stick in my mind, and so far these don't."
4,"Wonderful, comforting bed and body warmer!","I purchased this item last winter after trying one at a friend's home! It was cold and my back was hurting so she brought out this incredible 'bed warmer' which was long enough for me to wrap around my entire low back and waist area. Shortly, I was in slumberland, and quite embarrassed when they awakened me!! As soon as I returned home, I went to the computer and ordered one. It has been an incredible addition to our family as many people have benefitted from the Battle Creek Thermophore Bed Warmer - friends recovering after surgery, friends and family with colds or flu, or just myself needing cozy warmth.This item is well worth the purchase as I consider it my warm friend!"
1,Buyer beware!!!!!,"I purchased a RJ4200 DVD CDG Divx RJ4200PK Karaoke Player, 2 Mic + Supercore 2008 - 16 CDG on 2/16/09 though a karaoke website and got it in about a week. I hooked it up and the CDG played just fine, but when I tried to sing into the mic it would make a terrible crackling sound. I thought that maybe it was the mics, so used the my own mics that I've always used with my old karaoke machine and it did the same thing. I also tried to adjusting the mic volume, the echo, the delay, and the results were all the same. I feel like I would of been better off just buying a little karaoke machine for $35 I never had any trouble with the one I've had for years. Anybody that says this karaoke player is great are fooling themselves and don't karaoke very much. If you enjoy karaoke like I do PLEASE HEED THIS WARNING!!!! Save your money and read good reviews before you make a purchase"
3,Am about to purchase this unit.,"Reading all of the negative reviews was pretty funny. You people don't realize that all karaoke players are supplied with microphones and cords that cost the manufacturer about one dollar. You will never have good sound from the supplied microphones plugged into any karaoke machine. I've had a couple of karaoke machines with supplied microphones before, and I either give the microphones away at one of my shows, or throw them away. I'm going to try this machine because I have professional equipment that it will be hooked up to. I will only be using the video/sound out jacks straight into my system. I need a machine that can access the tracks on a karaoke disc manually, right on the front panel. I also need a machine that auto-plays PAL DVD's at home with a visible time counter for disc editing. I'll write another review on this machine after I buy it."
5,Art & patience,"I discovered Ed Burtynsky by chance when waiting for my dentist...It was a chock : over its technical knowledge, this guy is capable to find the perfect angle to show what he wants to show !as we say in France ""respect !"""
4,Covers more than just Tai Chi,"Excellent read for any student of martial arts, not just for T'ai Chi. - During my brief period studying Chinese-Indonesia arts my Sifu recommended this book. I got more than I expected and wished I found it sooner. Most people know Tai Chi was created as a complement to meditation, but this explains why. This book will not teach you Tai Chi but explains the relationship of the movements in Tai Chi to the movement of Chi in the body. Includes diagrams and explanations of meridians, I Ching and Tai Chi Tu."
1,This is NOT the vinyl you want to upgrade your appliances!,"This is NOT the vinyl you want to upgrade your appliances! I have bought the heavier vinyl for the side of my fridge and it's nothing like this. Thicker, stuck well and went around corners excellent! I have had many tell me that they couldn't believe it was vinyl. The texture and color of the real stuff matches the stainless on the fridge perfectly! But then again, you get what you paid for. The real stuff is a little pricy. This is just like the rolls of contact paper you can buy in Home Depot for $9.99 only wider. Since I wanted this for craft projects it's no big deal, but it's also way to shiny to use on appliances. It would blind you, and I would not bank on it staying on for very long."
3,Average,"50% of the songs on this album are just brilliant, dark and scary, and beautiful at the same time. But the other half seems to be a bit too noisy for my Delerium ears! Very industrial. The covers and designs are brilliant!"
5,Appalachian Twilight,"Appalachian Twilight has it all. Murder, suspense, and just the right amount of romance. One automatically falls in love with the heroine, Josie McGuire, as she leads the readers through a suspenseful ""who-done-it."" The multi-faceted nature of Josie gives the reader a glimpse into long held Indian traditions, everyday problems of coping with diabetes, and the ""dog eat dog"" world of academe. The author's careful eye toward detail makes the academic world seem anything but dull and boring and the descriptions of the Appalachian Mountains causes one to want to drop everything -except the book - and rush to the nearest mountain. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat with its twists and turns and then slowly all of the pieces fit together. Can hardly wait for Broken Circle, the next book in the series."
4,I'm Free,"Emma has produced a sexy single! I love how she put full force into this single because it is fabulous!SONG: Lovely. However, compared to the remixes, I prefer the faster versions to the slow, drawn out version. It's a killer song, though.REMIX: The Full Intentions Freed Up mix is very nice! I like Dr. Octavo's Seduction mix better, but this is great! I like the beginning where it just goes, ""Free.... me..."" and then has some a capella mix with ""Let me lose to love you oh how I long to seduce you.""B-SIDE: ""Who The Hell Are You"" is a track off of her latest album of the same name as the single. It's a track with a lot of attitude and Emma pulls of the calm, cool, collected, but angry music styling.VIDEO: How she longs to seduce us? Too late. I'm seduced. She comes out in a lingerie-esque garment at a house with luxuries and everything. It's pure fantasy.Overall, great single, Emma. I just wanted to hear something newer than the b-side and remix which you can find on the album."
1,Refurbished in China.,"Plugged it in, and it won't stop beeping. Computer doesn't recognize it. Will update this if I can get it to work, otherwise it's being returned."
3,it was amazing!!,Have been putting this on any beet whether i grill or fry and it is amazing. Took to deer camp last week and put on some fresh deer steaks and wow it was amazing!!! Even better when you sprinkle a little bit over your salads!
3,An odd thing happened...,"Let me start by saying that the part that I received worked just fine, and it arrived in a timely fashion. But I ordered a new Dorman 698100, and I don't think that's what I received. What I received was a Borg-Warner rebuilt (I think) solenoid in a falling-apart greasy old box that was held together with packing tape... The box didn't say Dorman, the solenoid didn't say Dorman, and it looks different than the pictures I have of Dorman's part... But hey, it works great... I have no complaints, but there are a few unanswered questions about this order."
5,Best Resource I found,This was the only resource I found that truly helped me potty train my 3year-old son... He would fight it and have accidents everyday until we began using the ideas supplied in this book... It was fun and entertaining for us both and made training alot less stressful for us both!!! Buy it!
2,Less-than-Average Quality.,"The black balls used to hold the towels are not wide enough to prevent the towels from unraveling if yanked too hard. Additionally, it's a little difficult to take the paper towels off as the holder requires that you pull back a good bit on one side before there's sufficient room to take the roll off. The metal is not quality worthy either. I think there's a better product out there, I just have yet to find it!"
2,Rain FAIL,"This film is uncompelling and filled with overacting. Plus, the plot is impossible to follow nor can one discern the motivations of the film's protagonists. Finally, it needs to be in English. 90%+ was in Japanese.Don't waste your time."
5,Spiffy Shirts,"rating Five stars. ***** 12/26/2007. Very good shirts, banded collar shirts, ordered through Amazon. com. I recomend these. Neil Allyn shirts.Neil Allyn Banded Collar Poly Cotton Shirt for men - ON SALE"
2,"All this for 30,-$ ???","I,am a little bit frustrated.First, i was waiting about three month...Second, it's only a Floppy Disk...No Pics, No other Stuff..What's with the CD-Rom Version????That's sooo disappointing for me :-(((Here in Germany, there is no Chance to get further Information about an Porsche 912 Motor overhaul.Crab.."
1,"Only worth two cents for the two best track"" slippn & no lov","Deranged old man won't last , tryn to be like 2pac, he won't last long in this game . Just because he preaches the truth don't mean itsworth buyn."
1,No Way,"Terrible, Terrible. What a waste. These songs sound like they were done overnight. It almost sounded like he had nothing to say. There is prabably 1 good song on the album. This is nothing like the first."
1,WHY YOU WISH YOU WAS 2PAC?,"DMX wishes he was 2Pac but he's not no matter how hard he tries man. I ain't gonna str8 up diss him personally or say he has no skills, cause that's only my opinion. Buts I will say go get some real rap like Eazy-E, N.W.A , 2Pac or any Death Row or No Limit shiznit ta see how it's REALLY done."
5,just as good as the first one,"not as hard as its dark and hell is hot, a little more pop influence that reminded me more of method man than dmx. definitely worth buying if you like the first one"
4,The X Man Cometh Once Again....,"Flesh of my Flesh Blood of my Blood is the 2nd Album from DMX, and its a huge keeper. DMX brings the same formula from the first album and even decides to excite the hardcore with the bloody front cover. Non the less, this album is hardcore as hell and even darker. He doesnt change his style and thats a great thing, I actually think Pac would like X cause his style is somewhat like his. My favorite songs on this album r, my n*****, bring ur whole crew, We dont give a F***, Keep ur S*** the hardest, Coming from, The Omen, Slippin' No Love 4 me, Dogs for life, Blackout, flesh of my flesh blood of my blood, heat and ready to meet him. All of DMX albums are great so go and get them if u dont have them ."
1,Incredibly overrated... do NOT buy this garbage,DMX- Flesh of my Flesh Blood of My Blood... this is gutter trash. He's just copying Tupac anyway. Buy a 2Pac album instead.
4,DMX tkes rap to a new leval,DMX make rap go above and beyond it's limit. He uses real life experiences to express himself.
5,dmx is tight!!,dmx is tIgHt!!! this is his best cd with rUfF rIdErS athem part 2!! and slipen!! those songs are tight! everybody here is talkin' about it! THIS DOG IS TIGHT!!!!!
1,Wac with the capital W,"Is this what happened to Tupac. It isn't hard to be a success when tou take two styles and combine them to be Master T. Come with it for real DMX, you represent the fake thug in all of the #itch made Mc's. Hip Hop isn't blasting and running from police chump, stop humiliating the game."
5,"Hell yea, DMX is hard as hell","I got an advance copy of this and i gotta say that dmx keeps it real. He doesn't sell out like most rappers do after they make it big. My copy doesn't have the same tracks as listed in amazon, though, but it's still da bomb. My copy has 18 tracks and most of them are phat as hell. He's got a song with mary J blige so you know that he blew up! he even does a track with marylin manson, but i don't care for that one too much. DMX is a bad --- and he's one of the only true hardcore artists left. WHERE MY DOGZ AT?!?!?!?!?!!!!"
4,PRETTY GOOD C.D.,"THIS IS A GOOD C.D. TO PICK UP WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE HEARING GREAT BEATS.THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH DMX IS HE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT KILLING,HE NEVER TALKS ABOUT HIS FAME AND HIS MONEY.I THINK DMX IS A GREAT RAPPER AND THIS IS AN AWESOME C.D. TO PICK UP. IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS HIS FIRST BUT IS STILL WORTH HAVING AND LISTENING TO FOR QUITE A WHILE."
3,"Farily Good ,His other Cd is Better","DMX'S CD IS OK!!! I'VE HEARD BETTER FROM HIM .IF YOU WANT A GOOD CD GET HIS OTHER CD,IT'S DARK AND HELL IS HOT!"
4,Flesh Of my Flesh,"I just got the tape today. It's phat, check it out. I still don't think it's as good as It's Dark and Hell is hot though. 'No Love 4 Me' will probably be one of the top songs of '99. RyDE OR DIE!"
2,Should've took more in releasing soph album,"I thought DMX's first album, It's Dark and Hell is Hot, was blazin, but Flesh of my Flesh was a big letdown. I thought he should've spent more time in between albums rather than push his release out so soon. Flesh... might be topping the charts now, but I think people are more sold on his image, rather than his music."
5,The album is hard as hell!! Doesn't stick to hiphop styles,"DMX was the hottest rapper of 1998! And he will be one of the best for years to come. Learning from the successes of 2pac and Ice Cube, DMX released 2 albums within 1 calendar year, and saw both debut at #1. The new album is his best work so far, because he fails to stick to the norms of rap and hip-hop. Usually rappers try to satisfy all types of listeners by mixing up songs and having some slow songs, some moral songs, some ""Chick"" songs, and some ""Dance"" or ""Puffy"" songs....DMX rarely does any of this and it is found in the new album as well as his first album. Fearless of the criticism of critics, DMX says what is on is mind, and always makes his point. His songs are sure to pump up and hype any ""true"" rap fan. Finally there is a rapper who isn't afraid to be who he is."
5,It's one of the Best Rap Cd's ever.,DMX expresses the way real people feel. He talks about stuff that happened to him. He tells it the way it is. He don't lie like some of those other rappers do about what they have or what they did. He deserves the upmost respect for his lyrics.
1,this cd was not even close to the dmx cd before it,i thought this cd was over rated and bad. they tried to rush it so they would have another hit cd too bad this cd wasnt even close to a hit cd.
3,good,DMX's first cd was better....but this cd is aight. my name is jae rim and i love my neighbor.. his name is joe bob.
1,whak,"I don't know what anybody was thinking hen they decided they liked this garbage. The only reason this album did as good as it did was because it was from X. This cd did not even come close to It's Dark and Hell is Hot. It was like DMX decided his name was big enough that he didn't have to put effort into this album because most people will buy it just because its by him. This album was sorry and if you disagree with me you know you're playing yourself. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater and I like DMX as much as most people do but we all know he could have done better if he would have taken a little more time. I think this album was done for the money and not for the love of hip hop."
2,DMX/Ruff Ryders worst album ever!!!,"I was really disapointed at this album, most of the beats is the worst I ever heard... The beats makes NO LIMIT's early producers sounds like GODS!U will be greatly dissapointed, buy IT's DARK AND HELL IS HOT instead it's DMX's greatest, they could have easily removed 6 wack songs from this album and made it an EP instead"
1,"HE'S GANGSTA, Y-E-A-H R-I-G-H-T.",I cant believe people are still buying into this clown's wannabe gangster image.He is simply just selling this gangsta image only to sell records because the truth is that this guy has never been a gangster.Do you really think that gangsters live in beverly hills or have nine security guards?This new album with his group is as silly and dumb as anything you have ever heard of him.The beats are really weak and the lyrics are even weaker.This fake gangster is probably laughing at all the stupid people who are buying into his bull and making him alot of money.Without dre making the beats for him he would still be selling crack and getting arrested by the police.DO NOT BUY THIS NONSENSE!!!
3,G-G-G-G-G- G Unit!,"What's the next step after you've had a monster year. Put on your crew of course. Backed by Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and the still-incarcerated Tony Yayo, 50 cent's 'Beg for mercy' is not you're typical support group album. Each member of G-unit can hold his own lyrically. Tracks like 'Stunt 101' and 'Guns for sale' are the same thugged out, arrogant and heavy spitting music that made 50 Cent hot. Althought it's going to have a tough time with comparisons to 'Get rich of die trying,' G-Unit comes just as hard on this album, if not harder. Banks, Yayo and Young Buck add their own hunger and determination to the mix."
3,"not bad, but too much of 50 cent","well, beg for mercy is not a really bad album, you could say it is good. but most people would expect something different, something rather different from 50 cent. but i can tell you the sad truth... it is nearly 70% 50's style, he raps all the time and his two friends just act in the backyard of an old house (if you know what i mean).... i would say the first songs are good and they are real earcatchers, but after listening to them for a while you get tired of it... so the best thing you could do, is to buy yourself the 50 cent album get rich or dy tryin, if you haven't done that yet, or invest your money into other things than this"
1,Beg for mercy is Beg for Nothing,"This album is one of the year's worst albums even worse than nelly and chingy combined, stunt 101 is garbage, good beats, but stupid lyrics, the rapping is horrible(with the exception of lloyd banks), and the same old, SAME old useless plot goes downwards over and over.No Wonder Jigga and DMX Retired and ja will be nextPoor 2pac must be rolling his ashes at his grave site in north carolinaThis album is a shameful reminder that people can't do anything anymoreA Big Thumbs down for me on this albumBig Tymers is much better than this."
4,"Great ""Get Pumped"" Album","This album is hardly high-concept or great art, but it's solid, fun, catchy music. When you want to get pumped on the way to the club, it's hard to beat. If you just want something fun and enjoyable that keeps it moving and doesn't require you to think too much, you'll probably enjoy this. If you want groundbreaking work, unconventional beats or ambitious lyricism, you will be disappointed."
1,Beg for mercy is wack,I loved Get rich or die trying.But 50 know he is wack for this one.Ja rule personally is a better lyricsist than 50 but 50 ain't wack.It's just that he loss some cool points with this album from me.Young Buck is wackTony Yayo is tight Lloyd Banks is tight but they need a better album than this and they know it.
1,"Beg For Mercy, Maybe They'll Stop","50 Cent and the rest of the G-Unit crew are no talent image based rappers. Not only are the verses they rap weak, but they rap poorly and slowly. The only saving grace is slightly good beats. They rap about nothing important, and FAR too many love songs, ala ""Smile"" and ""I Wanna Get To Know You"". The only people that like this crap are clueless kids that think this stuff is ""gangsta"". If you want real rap, listen to Pac, Biggie, Dayton Family, Bone Thugs N Harmony, Top Authority, Gangstarr, Scarface, Too Short etc."
2,you want gangster rap this isn't it,"sorry but westside connection is much better and this does'nt represent the streets whatsoever you want gangster rap try wc, mc eiht, spice 1, and southcentral cartel.this really sucks and eminem is getting really desperate."
1,'Betta Ask Somebody' before you buy this (...),"Why did I buy this album? Well one of my friends is into this commercial junk and recommended this to me. I took it back after the following day. I don't like their flow, they find a way to flow badly on the most simple tracks, which, I could probably make in a few hours. This is the worst ever era for commercial hip-hop. Compared to the 50 cent album, which lacked lyrical depth but had a few club bangers, this is a lot worse. Don't buy it. If you really want some commercial (...).. buy something OTHER THAN THIS."
1,beg for another job,"what kind of sh*t is this that were are listening to. Yo, 50 your cd get rich or die tryin' was worthy, but come on nobody wants to hear the exact same sh*t, that is all this album is, is smae ol' sh*t. This album was so horrible that I traded the mutherF*cker in for gettin' an album that is worth checkin' out. Verses are wack, beats are horrific to listen to and why does 50 think he goin' to take over hip hop he ain't even close to it, there are veterans in the game that will f*ck him up in one verse. For all these people readin' this get an album that you all will luv and as far as 50 goes he is only woth his name."
2,"""Beg For Mercy"" after Buyin' this (2.5 stars)","This was a highly anticipated album, but it seemed so rushed once they got it into stores. To be honest, there were only 2 good songs on here, the opening track ""G-Unit"", where Buck, Banks, and 50 all kill their verses, and ""Groupie Love"" w/ Butch Cassidy. If you wanna get technical, ""Salute U"" w/ Buck & Banks, ""Eye for Eye"", and ""My Buddy"" are pretty good tracks too. But ""Stunt 101"" was probably the WORST G-Unit single the ever be released, as the beat is just annoying. The track ""Beg for Mercy"" is just a sped-up, knockoff of ""Back Down"". Lloyd Banks' ""Smile"", though a decent song, is just his version of ""21 Questions"". And the closing track ""I Smell Pu**y"", has been heard by EVERBODY through mixtapess, and it was a bad choice to be put on this album. Basically, is you didn't get the album, you made a GREAT choice, as the next G-Unit album will be SO MUCH BETTER."
1,Why was my review deleted?,"What the hell is going on here? My past 3 reviews haven't been posted and another one got deleted (for Deicide's Legion). I seriously think Amazon has something against me which wouldn't surprise as I'm one of their most controversial reviewers.As for this review, do I really need to go in depth on why these guys suck horribly? I think the cd cover pretty much speaks for itself. Everyone pretty much knows how I feel about modern rap. This is just a 'test review' to see if Amazon hasn't totally abandoned me yet. OK LET'S SEE IF THIS ACTUALLY GETS POSTED! Plus we have to lower the average of the cd to 1 star, remember my new mission I mentioned in the Chingy review? PEACE."
1,this is no game anymore,"if truely 50cent is the future of hiphop,then it is abvious to me and you what will become of hiphop in the next future,bringing out an ablum like this,i think this people should take there time, not to rush in bringing out ablums,this is not a platnium effort,the only classic track in it, is stunt 101,the other tracks is pure and undiluted crap.i think people should not make the same mistake i made buy purchasing this ablum,instead go for blood in my eyes."
1,I AM DOING A NATIONWIDE G-UNIT BOYCOTT#3-KEHINDE OLOWOYO,"WHEN THESE GUYS ARE COMING OUT,I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR ALBUM,BUT WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR THEY MADE A SUPERGARBAGE ALBUM, I SMELL FISH, IS THAT YOU FIDDY, I SMELL FISH, IS THAT YOU LLOYD, I SMELL FISH, IS THAT LIVA THE MAN-LADY, I SMELL RAW FISH, IS THAT TONY YAYO AND M.O.P, THOSE WANKSTAS SMELL LIKE FRESH SUSHI,IF I WAS AM ACTUALLY RAP ARTIST, I WILL TURN THESE NIGGAZ INTO CHOPSUEY, DOESN'T TONY YAYO LOOK SIMILAR TO KING LOUIE?

HAHAHHA!"
1,DISGRACE TO MUSIC!!!!,"I don't listen to much rap. When I do, it's mostly old stuff like N.W.A., Public Enemy, Ice Cube, humously issued Tupac (the albums he released when he was live), KRS-One, etc. It's a shame how rap has become so low. If you want good rap, listen to any of the above mentioned rappers/groups. Until rap finally becomes good again, listen to good quality music like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, etc."
2,G-Unit drops and... ehh,"Well, it's not a terrible cd, but its about 1/4th of what the Black Album is. Lloyd Banks proves he is truly the most innovative, and the best rapper in the group, and Buck basically flops out. He isn't tight at all. 50's verses are alrite, but nothing we haven't heard before. I personally can't wait for Yayo to get out of jail because his flow is siiick. Heres 1 vote for a Yayo, Banks group. 50 stay solo and find something new to rhyme about. And Buck please... just go away. Every1 go buy Jay-z's final effort ""The Black Album"" its a true classic, and the last album from the best living rapper in the world"
2,Disappointed......very disappointed,"If you're thinking that this album is even close to being as good as ""Get Rich or Die Trying"", you're sadly mistaken. Most of the songs in there is garbage, with the obvious exception of Stunt 101. I was very impressed with Buck and Banks on ""Blood Hound"" and ""Don't Push Me"" on 50's last album, but what da hell!I found ""My Buddy"" very annoying, even though it was a good metaphor. ""Smile"" wasn't very good either, 'cuz Banks needs to improve his flow. On the contrary to what Ja fans and 50 haters say, 50 Cent has pretty good lyrics I mean, who didn't think ""...to make it up I do whatever it take/I love you like a fat kid love cake"" was hot? It's just that Buck and Banks need to improve on their rap skills, or they'll just bring down 50."
1,G unit so hood or G unit so bad?,"yo holla bawla, i just got in from heardin this LP at the store and its def whack yo. It be, money this, girls that, and shooting people here, but it's all been said before. Nothin here aint original,...just terrible artistry. Them beats be flowin a little on Betta ask somebody and Beg for mercy, but gangstah, pulease! Them lyrics just aint be spittin like they should, ya feel? uh oh, holla to my ganstas in pa, and watch out for the new bo' jacksuhn album, that shiz is fo money!>!>! aight peace bawlas, playas and hatas."
4,GGGGGGGGGG-UNIT,"ALBUM IS CRAZY GANGSTA,LOVE WHATEVER IS ALL ON THIS ALBUM 50,BUCK,YAYO,AND BANKS KEEPING GANGSTA CAN'T WAIT 4 THE NEXT ONE"
1,is it luther vandross or 50 cent??? anyway its horrible!!,"this my friends is one of the worst albums ive heard in a long time!! 50 cent sings so many hooks on this album to the point i dont know whether luther has gotten better from his stroke or if its a crap *coughs* rap cd!! anyway i wouldnt waste my time or money on this garbage!! garbage beats, wack love songs, terrible lyrics!! 50 and g-unit need to go back to the drawing board cause beg for mercy had me begging for mercy!!! before 50 disses the next man for doing something, maybe he should take a long hard look at himself in the mirror, if it doesnt break!!"
1,Vitamin k underground chi-town rapper,"I gave this cd 1 star because it seems rush through. The onlything they seem to to be concerned about is being coomericialand assesible. They do not touch on any real topics. I can't stand when people think they are so good. They are good withlyrics, but just good. This is commerial rap."
4,WOW,"people who don't like this cd suck at life and need to stop listenin to rap as soon as possible, quit complaining about how they rap about killing and jewlery, if you don't like it don't listen to it, thats what they are always gonna rap bout so deal with it and they are gonna continue to sell.Anyways great cd, Young Buck surprised me on here, he came better then i thought he would, Lloyd Banks was alright, and 50 sounded like he does on his old stuff, not like the mumbling he does on Get Rich or Die Trying."
1,Rap at Its Absolute Worst,"Ever since 50 Cent blew up with `Get Rich or Die Tryin' and screamed ""GGGGGG-UNIT!"" over his songs, I knew this was destined to be a disaster. Despite having respectable work on the mixtape circuit pre-`GRODT', I knew G-Unit would follow the same path as 50 and sell out to move units. At least on `GRODT' you can say that the beats were good. Not so on `Beg For Mercy'. Lackluster production, lyrical content, lyricism, and talent make this one of the worst CDs I've ever heard. 50 has lost his flow, Lloyd Banks is a walking punch line, and Young Buck... well he's just kind of there. There is not one CD on here that I like for the exception of `I Smell Pussy' (despite the huge contradiction they make when addressing Ja Rule) which was featured on a G-Unit mixtape before this was released and is old news.(0/5 mics)"
4,g-g-g-g-g- g unit!!!!!,"The new cd is raw. Most of the songs on here were tight although not all, 50 cent made an excelent debut and now hes back with his whole crew, some sick lyrics, dope beats, and overall gangsta tone makes this one not to miss. I must take a star off though due to a couple of wack tracks in the middle. holla!!!!!!!"
1,no dmx luv,stupid g unit. no Dmx luv here or on fitty centz get rich or die trying. tho in tha club wuz a killa song pi.mp wuz ok but get grand champ by Dmx instead. And oh yeah tha great depression is dmxz worst Cd. It is 3 stars.
2,What a waste!,"After seeing these guys perform on SNL (tucked in at the very end of the show), I was impressed. VERY impressed. It was one of the best live rap performances I've ever heard. So obviously I rushed out and bought the album. I want my money back.These guys are all great rappers. So there's absolutely no excuse for this album being as poor as it is. Even the beats are lousy, so you can't even dance to this. And the vocals are awful. C'mon guys...we all saw you perform ""Wanna Get To Know You"" on SNL and you sounded great. So why is it that the exact same song - PERFORMED WITH THE BENEFIT OF THE STUDIO - sounds so terrible? Because you didn't put any effort into it. You mailed it in. Well this listener says: RETURN TO SENDER!!!"
1,G-Unit! Oh Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"G-Unit!! Oh Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 50 Cents thinks that he's on top of the world now. His ego has gotten so big and he talks like he's been in the music business for twenty years. It makes my stomach sick the way he talks about other artist and disses them. When 50 cent first came out, he was a nobody and he wouldn't have blown up if it weren't for Doctor Dre and Eminem. This album was horrible. He's trying to blow up his friends by putting himself on the album because they know without him, they're nothing. Overall, this album sucks."
3,They all sound the same,"Every song on this CD is average. Nothing sticks out for being exceptional, or horrible. It gets very boring after more than a listen or two, since they all sound the same. Although I do enjoy listening to 50 rap fast on G'd up."
3,Free Yayo!! (please),"Let me start off by saying this album does have some good moments. But signing Young Buck as replacement because Tony Yayo is serving a bid might be the worst move in music's history. There is a reason why Cash Money fell off the face of the earth, they were horrible. This album would have been a lot better if Yayo hadnt got caught. Solid beats though, and decent punchlines from Banks. Too much b******, gunz and violence though. Best songs: g-unit, poppin them thangs, eye for eye, g'd up."
4,GREAT RAP ALBUM!,"If you're really into rap, you won't care what the songs are about. Yea, they're all about the same thing, but it's good gangsta rap. The beats, the tunes, and just their voices are great, and make this a joy to listen to and dance to. I don't see why so many people don't like this album. They just don't appreciate this type of music, thats why. If you're big on hip hop and rap, like I am, and know a lot about it, you'de realize that this stuff is good! And there are clean versions for all of you who don't like explicit lyrics.So don't listen to those who are hatin!"
1,Gangsta Rap's Version of Limp Bizkit.,"This Album is truly the worst album of 2000's, I Used to think Lil Jon and 98% percent of the bad rap is horrible, G-Unit and this album is even worse, Poppin Them Thangs is a rip-off of C.R.E.A.M., The Main title is truly bad, and the GGGGG G-Unit catch phrase, maybe the worst catch phrase creation of all time.and I Can't believe that some people had the nerve to call this truly complete waste of time better than NWA?This album is a truly total disgrace.This is not even a Gangsta Rap Album at all, it's pop gangsta rap at it's worse.This is the single worst album of the decade.If you want a current gangsta rap album of this decade, go buy Westside Connection's Terrorist Threats, not this disgrace to genre.Beg For Mercy: NO STARS"
4,tony yayo,the only thing to do do is to bring back tony yayo in a form of the original g-unit. and with 50 and banks it's gotta' wark.tony yayo is the realest and he got love from israel
1,Listen to,"Listen to Big L,Little Brother, Pharoahe Monch, Black Star, Ras Kass, Chino Xl, Killah Priest, Raekwon, Canibus, Jedi Mind Tricks, Jeru The Damaja, Gangstarr, Kool G Rap, Freddie Foxxx, Onyx,Brand Nubian,Organized Konfusion, Nas and Common Sense and tell me that these clowns who are a disgrace to hip hop are better then these artits. terrible! leave the game with your millions a be gone with yourselfs! these are the least cretive rappers of all time god bless common sense and talib kweli you creative men!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!3.5 of 10 lyrics 5 of 10 beats"
3,Beg 4 Mercy,"This album by g-unit is not as good as i anticipated, i thought this album was going to be good but it was aight. It had some good songs and some bad songs. I give this album a 3.5/5Top SongsG-UnitPoppin Them ThangsMy BuddyStunt 101G'D up (Best Song)"
2,BEG FOR MAINSTREAM! (LITERALLY),"MAINSTREAM... THAT SHOULD BE DA NAME 4 THIS CD, WAY 2 MANY OLD SONGS ON HERE LIKE I SMELL P*SSY. I SMELL MAINSTREAM. IF U LIKE FIFTY CENT, BUY GET RICH OR DIE TRYING INSTEAD.G UNIT BRAGGS ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY AND CRAP THEY HAVE, I PERSONALLY DONT CARE ANY MORE. G-UNIT IZ PLAYED OUT.BEST TRACKS:WANNA GET 2 KNOW UPOPIN THEM THANGS"
4,Ipod armband,The Tune Belt Ipod armband is a good buy. It is light weight and very comfortable to wear around your arm. I like the extra velcro flap on the side of the case which is where I put my headphones in. It is convenient when I go to the gym over here in Iraq. Good product! I will buy from Tune Belt again.
5,Great show!!,"This is one great show. I never ever watched it before this year. My father-in-law started buying the seasons one by one & every time we went down to visit we would watch some of them. I got hooked on these shows. I never knew how funny they were. Cartman is one crazy kid. He is always starting trouble with everyone & everything. This is a show for adults. If you have kids, I wouldn't recommend this or any other seasons. If you own all of the 10 seasons out there, then you don't want this set because they are all in the 10 seasons. I don't own any of them so I bought this set. It's really funny. From Santa carrying a gun to satanic animals. Some of it is just plain sick. But very funny. It's no wonder that this show was once banned from TV. If you like Family Guy & it's dry humor, you will like this Christmas DVD. If you can't handle bad language then you won't like this or any others."
3,Some really good moments!,"I was very surprised to find some very nice touches to this new recording, being overly familiar with the music. The problem I found was Kate Shindle , her vocals are very weak and her huge ballad ""Someone like you"" is just awful. Better luck next time."
2,Simply Not Good,"I've listened and enjoyed every Jekyll & Hyde recording in existance. I was really hoping to enjoy this one and share it with friends just the same. However, I couldn't possibly do that now having listened to ""Resurrection."" Both women on this recording find themselves not signing but whining through most of the songs. Rob Evan is about as equal to the talent of the women. But, to hear revisions to these great songs may still sway you to purchase this item, despite the lack of talent. Well, let me throw in this last bit of criticism. Guitar solos. That right folks... guitar solos. The guitar sounds fine mixed with some of the songs but whenever they let the guitarist venture outside of the score it becomes cheesy and unbearable. However, if you're looking for something cheesy and unbearable... try one of my favorite songs (but not from this recording): ""A Dangerous Game."" Any amount over $5 would be a waste of your money."
3,J&H A Bit Disappointing,"I've been a huge fan of J&H since the beginning and was looking foward to this new CD, just for a new song or two. I like the new song, but the vocals on this CD by the two leading ladies was disappointing. Kate Shindle sounds extremely weak and Brandi is just a bit better. Thank goodness for Rob Evans. At least he has the strength and power in his voice to carry his songs."
4,Hits and Misses- but where it Hits- Watch Out!!,"Rob Evan's rendition of ""I Need to Know"" and ""This is the Moment"", Kate's ""A New Life"", as well as Bandi+Kate's rendition of ""In His Eyes"" are enough to pick this album up.Kate's ""Someone Like You"" made me feel positively ignored by the lack of intensity.Everything else is solid- but the tracks above will make you soar and itch for the upcoming movie adaptation (PLEASE PLEASE hire Rob Marshall to direct it!!)"
4,A solid effort,"Being a huge Ozzy and Sabbath fan, I figured I'd pick up this album. It was well worth the money. This album is much better than Bill's first solo album. Too bad he won't release his next album (Beyond Aston)because it sounds amazing as well (check out his website). Pick up this album, you will be quite surprised. It's definately Bill's style, which you would know if you listened to the songs he sang with Sabbath. A mix of blues, jazz, hard rock."
3,Not even close to a Eastwood performance,Thought the movie and the performance by Anthony Steffen could have been better. Probably could have enjoyed the film if the anoying back ground noice durning the last 30 minutes of the film wasn't their. Eastwood doesn't have to worry about Steffen making his day.
3,Thwn try novel,"William Henry Brisbane (1806-1878) was a Baptist pastor and physician who inherited a plantation with its slaves. Upon freeing his slaves, he was forced out of South Carolina and took refuge in Cincinnati. As he reluctantly became an abolitionist, he searched for ways to promulgate his convictions and tried fiction. A common device by abolitionists, this was also used by his Cincinnati neighbor, Harriet Beecher Stowe. However, WHB was much better at expository writing than fiction. After a disappointing experience at publications, he moved to Philadelphia and hoped the atmosphere of this leading publications city would work to his advantage. It did not.This is not good literature, but it is a helpful and informative document for the study of abolitionism.A biography of Brisbane is being written."
2,Sorry... it tries too hard to rock.,"I love the Naz. They are my BOYZ! I love most of their albums after ""Hair of the Dog."" ""No Jive"" was awesome, but the two follow ups to that, this and ""Move Me"" just try to hard to ""rock out.""There is a point in life where rock stars have to cease singing about cheerleaders, booze and sex, and Nazareth has passed that point. They wrote prolific songs in the 80's about politics, and life in general, so I expect more. This album has about 2 good songs."
1,our miss brooks,"I thought I would be getting quality programming coming from Amazon. However in this case I received a very very poor quality video. These shows were taped off a television program similar to nick-at-night.It was channel 50....wherever that is. Unfortunately, you see parts of commercials, station identifications, poor quality jumping from one scene to another. There are parts of shows that start and than just stop and don't end. The picture quality was very poor at times. You see that someone was using the tracking button but to no avail. I would not recommend you buy this videos from Amazon's private dealers."
4,great show,i like investigation on aircraft fatalities. This is a great show and amazing to causes of certain aircraft crashes. I like this
5,Cute and Fun,"I had so much fun reading this book! Its about a girl called Meimi who is actually a magician-like thief who returns stolen and wrongfully taken items to their rightful owners. Her nun-in-training friend helps her with info on stolen items, while the son of a detective, Asuka Jr. tries to capture her."
4,good stuff,"this was a great resource when teaching about the armor of god. i also used some other resources, i wouldn't rely soley on THIS book to teach about armor of God.very good starting place."
4,Good Toy,I liked this toy Gondor is my favorite counry and this was the first soldier i found for them. it can stand by itself and looks great on display. the detail is amazing!!! If you like Gondor this is a must have toy
4,Nice,The texture and the bendability are amazing with this!!! I only wish it came with some sort of bag to keep it from getting dusty etc.
5,Sweet book!,"Didn't really know what to expect and have been pleasantly surprised, I love this one. Wendy Alec is so talented and anointed!"
5,Eye Opener . Will never be the same ....,"I was humbled, rebuked, encouraged and shocked at the details Wendy potrays in her journal. I couldn't relate to the intimacy she has with the father(maybe becuase I'm a guy or simply not spiritually mature enough), but you can't walk away without a feeling of jeoulosy(or longing) at how some people are so much in tune with what God is doing and saying on earth and in the heavenlies.When you read the book, you'll no doubt feel multiple waves of conviction, relief and reflection and the Fathers voice resonates in your own spirit. You world view and priorities are guaranteed to definately change.Warning....You'll need some time to grieve over your own shortcomings but you'll feel encouraged to sharply focus your life in a brand new direction and with greater and meaningful purpose...Definately highly recommended !!!"
3,Attempts to be more than a mystery,"In fact, this book attempts to explore the difficult and fraught-with-taboos world of race relations and racial riots in Washington, DC. In that, it's realistic, and exceeds the boundaries of its genre, and it takes a balanced view this is difficult in such a political minefield. Despite all this, it is exceptionally linear and there is no change in our perspective from the initial to final stages of the novel, which despite all of its organic detail invests itself in christlike characters and demonic ones, but particularly thin formulations, those. I am inclined to like what the author attempted but would not read another by him."
5,Pelecanos gets better with each outing,"The writing is the best I have read in the crime genre in years, and the characters are drawn perfectly. Each new addition to his resume seems to add something amazing, surprising and interesting. Pelecanos is not only the best writer in the genre, he is probably one of the best American authors working today - period. Everything is fresh, and the story crackles with action on each page. For sheer entertainment value it is unbeatable. The plot is tight, the background realistic and the pace never slows. Not a boring passage in 400 pages."
5,It's like Zao and Norma Jean having a kid.,"What happens when you bring an old Zao vocalist together with a band that likes to play very chaotic hardcore metal a la Norma Jean? Well you get Symphony in Peril stupid! Certainly not Ja Rule, like all you guys were probably thinking. This is really good chaotic fun headbanging, thrashing, kill everyone with noise MUSIC.For those who like Norma Jean and Zao GET THIS NOW. They were good live too."
4,Table and Chair set for Christmas 2012,"I recently purchased this table and chair set for my two granddaughters for Christmas. My husband and I spent a Sunday afternoon assembling it. While it took us a awhile to put it together (about 2 1/2 hours), it was well worth the effort. Read all of your instructions and pay attention to them. My husband used his own tools to assemble, the wrench with the set is really of no use.The table and chairs are really cute! I am sure it is going to be well used in their playroom. The colors are nice (I purchased the pastels) and all pieces look sturdy."
3,not as good as beat noir,"I don't really own much spahn ranch, but my first exposure to them as warmth of silence, off beat noir, and damn it, that's still to me the greatest thing I've ever heard by the group. Standout tracks on this are probably black skinned blue eyed boys and futurist limited, but yeah, I don't know, the whole album has a kind of one level feel and sometimes I just want more than it gives me. It is good though. really quite good. what a vague review."
2,Is this bait and switch?,"When we ordered the splint, we recall the picture showing a different brand than the one that that was received. It didn't fit as well as the brand we thought was ordered which was a replacement for a worn out bunion splint. When we emailed the company, we got no reply. Our solution will be to avoid the Atrex Company."
