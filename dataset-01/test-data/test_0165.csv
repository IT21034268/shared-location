5,"Support Battlestar Galactica, no matter how you feel about Universal or SciFi","Seriously,We all know it is taking forever for Season 3 to release on DVD in the states. The last bit of information that I received about Season 3, is that it will be hitting shelves around the same time Season 4 will air, which is April 2008. Universal is playing games with our money by only offering the series via online episodes. We shouldn't hold this against Battlestar Galactica by giving ""Razor"" a poor rating. Support the show, make sure you all tune in November 24th. Heck if you want, you can even get a FREE screening November 12th of Battlestar Galactica: Razor in a theater near you.Aside from all that babble, we all know that ""Razor"" is going to be awesome. 5 STARS!!! Based on the webisodes that I have seen."
4,PM5K rules,"This DVD is a great dvd. With all the backstage scenes and music videos. It is even better on DVD than VHS. the sound and graphics blow you away!!! If you have a Playstation 2 or DVD player and are a fan of Powerman 5000, you must get this DVD!"
3,"not enough standouttracks, definitly not as good as Though luv","The album isn't bad it's just a little boring, the beats laidback: way back. And the fellas don't seem to inspired.Tough Luv is one of my fav-albums but this is not by a longshot...And It's short too less than 50 minutes, Tough Love was over 70 minutes and almost every track was a standout."
2,"Different album, Same Sh*t!!!","from seeing the album cover I expected the Brothers From Another to be waaaayyyy better then what I heard. I almost fell asleep listening to it the first time. The later part of the album is what made me not throw the cd away, starting with grown men pt 2 and on. MAN... I thought they were going to really do it from the sparkles I heard here and there from TOUGH LUV. I ain't given up on them though... but they need to stop trying to be hard and make music with a purpose...grow up again."
5,aMaZiiNg,"Play sure has proved that they are still strong as ever with their latest album. I immediatly fell in love with this cd the moment i bought it. The vocals are amazing expecially in ""O holy night."" I definatly recommend this album to anyone, even if you aren't a Play fan. Also when you buy this album and send in your recipt you get a holiday card from play! (if you mail it in before December 20, heard on play-mania.com) It's worth checking out!"
2,It's Easter,"This DVD celebrates the holiday of Easter. I wish that had been more clear in the description. However, we love Stanley and his show, but wouldn't have purchased this had we known it was about that specific holiday, which we do not celebrate."
5,I love the smell of mouthwash in the morning :),"I'm using either the Fresh Burst or the Cool Mint flavors. I can't say that I get fresh breath all day long just because I rise with Listerine twice a day but the mouthwash combined with some good toothbrushing - Sonicare has been my favorite tool for the past 10 years or so - and with a couple of extraListerine Pocketpaksdoes keep me confidently fresh.All I can say is that I miss the mouthwash in the morning if I'm away and I forget to bring some along.1.5L size is the right size to use at home, by the way."
2,Terrible,"This is a sad excuse for an album. The only reason I gave it two stars (instead of one) is the guitar playing, which is surprisingly good in spots, and for the occasional interesting rhythm/time change.These guys sound like good musicians (especially the guitarist and the drummer) but the songs come across flat. It's too much fluff and not enough substance."
4,excellent. should be read by all corporate leaders,"detailed, easy to follow blueprint on how to turn your company into a winner. chapter on dgc is especially informative."
4,Encouraging But Realistic,"Publishing Magazine Articles encourages you to pursue your love of free-lance writing for magazines, newspapers, and online content. However, Chapter 5 gives you a reality check by giving you the ""real scoop"" on being a free-lance writer. In other words, you have to be able to be persistent and accept rejection without quitting. If you can get past Chapter 5 and say to yourself, ""Yes, freelance writing is still for me!"", then the rest of the book is your key to becoming a successful free-lance writer."
5,Love this tea!!!,"Usually out of stock, but well worth the wait. Much more full-bodied than other teas."
1,Fantasy Fix = More of a Mix-Up,"Why does ""Fantasy Fix"" have the exact same plot and characters as the Other book ""A Bite with a Stranger""? Here's a case where the readers don't get two for the money. Make this situation clear to book buyers that like buying series' titles in big lots. Or am I wrong? Isn't the most recent book in one series really the same book used to start another series under a different name?"
2,Stinks,"I bought this lotion because I am new to tanning and somewhere I ran into or got recommended this lotion, I do not like the smell at all, its a turn off totally, but it does moisturize your skin. Shipping was fast and nothing was broken."
5,I've been a user of Body Drench for over 12 years!,"That's right I have used Body Drench for a long time! I first bought it at a salon in Maryland when I was on vacation and forgot to bring my lotion. I'm 60 years old now and it is hard to find a lotion that will soften enough. Body Drench not only softens enough, it keeps my skin soft all day. I have gotten compliments on how good I smell when all I have used is the Body Drench. It is a little on the pricey side but, if you buy the larger sizes it all equals out. I have asked for it as a Christmas gift and look forward to getting it. I recommend it to everyone I hear complaining about their chapped hands and dry skin. It is a wonderful product and will keep it on my Christmas list for a long, long time."
4,Update photo,"Prompt delivery, good price. My only suggestion would be to update the photo. It shows a bottle of 200, when the item being purchased is a bottle of 280!"
3,transition cd for Ratt as they explore a bluesy sound..,"The first four Ratt cds basically defined the 80's era ""glam metal"" or ""glam rock"" with their signature L.A. sound (along with bands like Motley Crue, Quiet Riot, Dokken, and many others).Here on their 5th cd, the bands shifts to a more blues-feel rock (think Aerosmith). And while I personally think ""Invasion of Your Privacy"" and ""Dancing Undercover"" are their best works, this set of songs have some powerful tracks, among them: 'City to City', 'Way Cool Jr.', 'I Want to Love You Tonight', & 'Chain Reaction'.Must have for any Ratt fan."
2,nothing like the original,"This dog is nothing like the original. I had a digger the dog over 20 years ago and that is why I wanted this for my son. The one I had was big enough to pull over, through and around anything! This one is so little and light it, plus the pull string is on the top/middle, so when it is pulled by a one year old it just topples over, even if he pulls it on a hard smooth surface. The only enjoyment he gets out of it is by pulling the string to get it to make the noises."
1,What's the problem?,"I follow the directions and the rice is dry and nowhere near cooked. I have to add more water and put it back in the microwave for a few min. After about 4 times of doing this, the rice is passable. I don't understand what the problem is. It has also overflowed and made a big mess. Very disappointing."
5,"Fast, convenient , easy cleanup rice cooker","I've had my cooker for 11 years (got it in college). Great for making a quick (12-15 min) single or double serving of rice. The plastic design (as well as the lid disassembly) makes for easy cleanup.Larger servings can be difficult due to boil-over issues, so I wouldn't recommend making more than about 3/4 cup of rice at one go. Also, the bits that snap over the lid to hold it down can come off and get lost. I still have mine after 11 years, but my college roommate lost one of his way back then. (It was after he moved out with his cooker in the summer that I had to pick up my own - I was hooked at that point.)"
5,amazing,This is my favorite movie of all time and I got it for 50 cents. Its the most amazing website in the world (:
3,4 stars for movie 3 for DVD,"I really liked this movie in the theater, and the 3-4 TV trailers were great, but the DVD is a real disappointment. The TV trailers are missing, there are no deleted scenes (Moxon and Jules making out in the forest, which is in the theatrical trailer), and the disc 'skips.'"
1,Didn't even work,I am very upset with this purchase! We opened it to play it and doesn't even work! We tried it on both of our DVD players and both said the disc couldn't be played.
5,Varsity Blues kicks!,For all of you that have played competitive high school sports this is a must for your collection. Everything from football to cheerleaders is covered in this awesome movie. The music also rocks and is tied into the movie perfectly.
2,Typical Teenage Rebellion Flick,"Again we have another ""Teenager who wins out in the end"" plot with a cool soundtrack and not much plot. The football sequences were better than most in this category, but this and the soundtrack are the only things going for this overrated teenie-bopper flick."
4,Perfect view into high school life and football mania.,"Johhny Moxon is the perfect antithesis of the common action hero seen in movies today. When called off the bench mid season to rescue the quaterback-less Coyotes, he is fulfilling only his father's drean of unseen glory. Through his eyes football exists only as a ticket out of Texas and to Brown University. Fine acting and some of the best football action sequences I've seen make this video a must see."
3,"I enjoyed the movie, but the ending is ridiculosly","unrealistic. In real life, the school's principal would havebolted to the sidelines as soon as he found out that his headfootball coach was not on the sidelines.I read the book Friday Night Lights about four years ago and thisis extremely close to a movie version of it. Many of the characters in the book can be easily matched to the ones on thescreen.This movie had appeal for me because I am in the sports medicinefield and have had to deal with coaches like those seen in thismovie, and at times have felt the same way that Jon Moxon didabout winning another district title for that coach: ""If wewin on Friday night, then Kilmer is still the greatest coach thatever lived, and nothing ever changes. He can just go on making uphis own rules and treating players like cattle.""Enough of the soapbox. The soundtrack is awesome and I enjoyed the movie"
1,Not my speed,"Although the cast was quite a lot of eye candy, I did not like this movie at all. Since I bought this for my husband who is an avid sports movie fan, I do not have to watch it again."
5,GREAT DEBUT BY A VERY UNDERRATED BAND,"I bought this album after first buying the 2nd album by KING'S X, ""Gretchen Goes to Nebraska"". Not as artsy or quite as creative as ""Gretchen"", this still ranks as one of my all-time favorite CD's because of the honest lyrics and spiritual dynamics of the material. If you want to hear rock music that LIVES and emphasizes the positive rather than all of the status quo garbage out there, this will be one of your faves. I only wish KING'S X hadn't lost this feel in their music. - Brad Farha"
4,Very Impressive,Ty's mysterious guitar tone. Doug's massive bass sound. Jerry's forceful yet dynamic drum work. Those incredible vocals. It all started here. This cd has timeless songs a KX fan can't do without. Goldilox is a masterpiece and so is King. This disc received critical acclaim upon its release and helped pave the way for the band's widespread success a couple years later. Essential if not quite as good as Gretchen. (4 & 1/2 stars).
2,I did not like this CD at all...,"Well, to put it plain and simple, I thought this was a terrible album. I listened to it several times, and thought that the band was reaching for something, but couldn't quite grasp it, and each and every time, I would come away not knowing what I had just heard, and hardly remembering a single chorus, tune or anything (and for the most part, thank God I didn't remember it). Now don't get me wrong, King's X did go on to write some great stuff, I own a few of their albums... but this one just doesn't do it for me. The only reason it gets two stars is because at least it's creative and different, and not pop drivel."
2,I didn't like it,"I have normal to dry skin. I'm not sure where the rave reviews are coming from, but this lotion was not for me. It is not greasy, but it has a soapy feel when you put it on. It feels like there's a film of soap on me and it left my skin feeling dry. The scent did not agree with me. It has a very ""old lady perfume"" smell that lingers. Unfortunately I purchased the gallon size based on all the great ratings. If you're curious... I'd recommend you go with the smallest size. I'm not sure what grade the ingredients are but overall the lotion feels very cheap to me."
3,Keeps Yout Interest,Author has done an excellent job of capturing a period of history that little is known about. Little is written about the Indians around the time white men were first seen in the west.
2,Standard slapstick.,"Three shorts: DUNKED IN THE DEEP; BUBBLE TROUBLE; and LISTEN JUDGE. Outstanding plots, weak construction by Eddie Bernds."
4,Inspirational,"Expectancy by Jacky Clark Chisholm, is another anointed job well done,very inspirational,and will be a blessing to all that hear it."
4,"Low impact, good for beginners","This DVD is very low impact- there is only one short section that has any bouncy movements. I adapt these or fast-forward through them, which makes it a perfect workout for someone like me, who experiences knee pain/shin splints/etc with most other exercise DVDs.The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of reasons mentioned by other reviewers: the song does kind of sound like a country song, and some of the moves aren't traditional. If you are very serious about learning traditional hula dance you should purchase a different DVD. If what you want is a good low-impact workout, you should choose this DVD."
5,FANTASTIC BOOK!!!!!!,After reading the first and second in this series I thought it couldn't get any better. Was I ever wrong! L.A. Banks has found the way to dominate the vampire world with imagery that will make you feel that you are a part of it all. You'll talk out loud to the characters. You'll love some passionately and hate others intensely. But you won't be able to put it down. Ms. Banks' writing is magical.
1,terrible writen book and book,"I really was disappointed in this book and author. I nver read L.A. Banks before and thought I give it a try. The cover captured my attention...once again people don't let the cover fool you...thought I learned from prior bad books with nice covers. I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THIS BOOK AT ALL. I AM NOT FLUENT IN BLACK SLANG. L.A. BANKS SHOULD OF WRITEN THIS BOOK IN PROPER ENGLISH AND NOT SLANG THEN THE BOOK WOULD OF BEEN OK. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE AT ALL. I HAD TO SKIP THROUGHT THE ENTIRE BOOK AND GET THE TORTURE OVER WITH QUICKLY! I WAS SO LOST,I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT! I DO NOT LIKE TO READ SLANG BOOKS AND WISH BLACK AUTHORS WOULD WRITE GOOD BOOKS IN PROPER ENGLISH AND NOT SLANGGGG! I WILL NEVER READ HER AGAIN. I REALLY TRIED TO AND GAVE HER A CHANCE BUT I JUST COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER WRITING AND THE WHOLE BOOK. THAT IS IT FOR ME"
2,You need to read the other books first.,"I love the scifi/romance/supernatural genre and am always on a quest to find interesting and hefty books. I had been looking for something to ""sink my teeth into"" and was thrilled when I saw this at the grocery store.I've finished the first two chapters and am really not sure what to do next. I hate the slang, trying to hear the dialog instead of reading it helps but since I am not used to reading slang it puts me off and hinders my getting into the story. I'm considering putting this book on the shelf and getting the other two since I am feeling a little lost in terms of plot and think getting some backround might help me enjoy the current story more."
5,GIft for Husband,I bought this for my husband and a friend of mine..they both loved it =D..so that is all that matters to me.
5,a masterpiece,"when i bought this album i chose it because i liked the name and the cover, and when i listened to it, i discovered how lucky i was, because what was entering through my ears was some if the best music from one of the best metal bands that i have ever known. this cd is melancholic and beautiful, i will always keep it close to my heart."
1,Embarrassing for metal as a genre,"This is pretend progressive music. While these guys are great musicians, they haven't figured out songwriting or conceptually what they're doing, so this is as boring as a slide show in grade school. Beep."
2,O.k.,"Interesting to see about the actual people who were involved in the Harlem Renaissance, but the author uses so many names that it gets confusing."
4,Allignment Template for Cabinets,Worked the way they advertised. This was a handy little rig. Made our job a heck of a lot easier.
4,A very well crafted and put together movie.,"From start to finish, the film had a genuine kick ass feel to it. Conery, Cage, and Harris gave excellent performaces. Harris a little short of an oscar in my opinion. I hold the musical score in high reguard as well. It certainly added to the movie's feel and gave it depth. To tell the truth though, Im not too quick to give something the highest rating just because I liked it. This film isn't a masterpiece but, I can tell they're doing something right."
3,the rock,i think the rock is a great film i watch it every day and if anyone can tell me the name of the theme music pleise contact me at bigbrother121@hotmail.com
5,Greatest action movie of all time,"The Rock is an excellent movie from beginning to end. From the beginning, Hummel (Ed Harris), a disgruntled war hero, steals the VX Gas Rockets that he will launch on San Francisco. Nicolas Cage is a chemical weapons expert selected by the FBI to diffuse and stop the launching of the gas. Sean Connery is the only man to ever escape from Alcatraz. He is locked up by the FBI because he stole the Microfilm containing everything ever done be the British Members of Parliment and the British Prime Minister. Together, Cage and Connery lead a team of US Navy Seals to stop Hummel. This is a great movie for anyone who likes non-stop action."
5,"along wioth bad boys, one of my favorites","Jerry Bruckhiemer's signiture style and camera angles that showed up in the blockbuster, bad boys, are back. the rock has great actors (sean connery is awesome!), a super soundtrack, but most of all, edge-of your-seat action. great movie!"
2,Full of nonsense electronic beats,"This album is not an exciting one. ""Give you all my love"" and ""you wrote the book"" are ok. The rest of the album is just a bunch of nonsense electronic beats. The worst part is the title song of the albus ""nights like this"". I cannot imagine anyone would dance to this rhythm."
2,bored. during the sex scenes.,"also, the hero was irritating enough that she should have refused to talk to him til he gave an actual explanation instead of letting him convince her to sleep with him."
3,adequate but small,"This table is adequate but small tilts and adjusts up and down fine, it is small for my purposes which is using maps, GPS and books to plan vacations and write recipes and ideas in notebooks. since i have a thick carpet it is very difficult to move without standing up to move it. If not storing it at the foot of the bed it can easily be in the way. And lastly it would be fantastic to have a storage drawer that slides out the end for storage of pens,pads books etc. but over all it functions,when tipped at an angle a lip would help hold things in place."
1,.....,"Typical metalcore. Average mediocre musical skills. Highly unoriginal. How they can be called thrash or be compared to the big thrash of 4 (Slayer, Anthtrx, Metallica and Megadeth) perplexes my mind. Screaming screamo vocals. Matt Heafy is trying too hard. The CD cover is so emo-ish.I love metal, don't get me wrong. But this is NOT metal. It insults the metal genre. Emo/Screamo and metal are two totally different genres and to fuse them together and think you're original is a sin."
1,Very OVER-RATED,"Well, I'll just say it.... I don't like them.... They are an overrated metalcore band that sounds like all the other ""groundbreaking"" crap out there right now.... I think what really throws me off is the vocals.... He sucks as a screamer, but not a bad singer... So, I say just sing.. Don't scream, you sound retarded......"
3,"not bad, not great, typical stuff but to a point,, I will explain","Talent wise: Solid musicians with techinical skills. I like that they do solos and do the two guitar octave solos. It works well. The lyrics,, good when you can understand what he is saying. I say just sing man, scream if you wish, but make it understandable. I say DL it, I paid for it, unfortunately. You make your own decisions on it,, overall I am not impressed really. Someone needs to help them out in the studio, perhaps a new producer would work. They could be much more than they are."
3,good effort but...falls short. 3 1/2 stars,"This falls short because it is over-hyped and over-rated, I don't know why they are so over-hyped maybe because of the rising popularity of the genre metal-core and the media? But I do like songs such as: Rain, like light to the flies, Pull harder on the strings. But some songs seem to go know where and have bad vocals in some parts. They are good musicians but that's not enough. I listen to gore-metal all the way too Alternative, this cd does not work for me I'm sorry but that's just the way it is!"
5,Outstanding !!!!,If i Could Give this Album More Than 5 Stars i Would no Doubt Give it A Ten . This is an Amazing Piece Of Work . The Best Album Ive Heard in Years . Most Metal Bands wish They Even Come Close to What These Guys Pull Off. I Listen To This Album All The Time In Fact It Hasnt Left My cd Player Since The Day It Came Out . Looking Forward To More Killer Tunes From An AMAZING Band . I Recommend This To Anyone Into Metal .
2,How can it get such good reviews?,"I just don't get it. Metalcore? Emo-Metal? Emo-Core? Whatever you want to refer to this style of metal as, it is indeed the antithesis of originality in my opinion. All of these singers sound the same, and they don't even sound good to begin with. How am I supposed to know if I am listening to Killswitch Engage, Unearth, As I Lay Dying, Trivium, etc., etc? It amazes me how completely unoriginal metal bands are these days. Carbon copies galore.WARNING: If you want to hear another metal/em-core metal band, then by this album - you'll probably love it.If you are a purist and would like to hear some truly thought-provoking and ground breaking new heavy metal albums, then get something by Mastodon, Clutch, Arch Enemy, or Shadows Fall (The War Within). Other good bands include At the Gates, Damage Plan, Quicksand, Carcass, Obituary, and Napalm Death to mention a few."
1,Absolutely awful textbook,"I am a college student taking Probability (2 credit course) and our teacher used this book. I must say that this book is one of the worst books I have ever worked from. The material in the sections is all over the place, and the examples are blended in with the material so you really don't know what's going on. The fact of the matter is, the subject matter in this book isn't very complicated. However, the god-awful examples and the lack of clear and concise explanations really drives you insane. Not recommended at all."
5,A good book on statistical inference,"This is a wonderful book to introduce Probability and Statistical Inference to students with some background in calculus. The contents of the book start with summary and display of data, then gradually move to estimation, hypothesis testing, linear model and non-parametric methods. Several lists of distributions, confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis are given in the book. Many interesting examples are chosen to introduce some abstract concepts in probability and statistics. This book is not only useful as a text book but also useful as a reference book for further study."
3,Warren Diggers dog toy is BIG,"Warren Pet Products Diggers Vinyl Ball Dog Toy With SqueakerI bought this item thinking it would be a great replacement for the 2"" vinyl dog toy balls we had for our little Terrier and Dachshund dogs. WRONG... These things would be great for a Doberman. Tossed them out. I would have liked to know they were that big. Would not have purchased them."
3,rose art crystal zoo,"I bought this for my daughter and she loved it--but, there aren't enough colors to make it look like the picture on the box. At least 3 critical colors are missing--green, blue and purple. Im trying to see if I can buy some additional crystal markers but can't seem to find any."
3,Hula! Works out the abs.,I enjoyed this entire series. The setting is beautiful and it is extremely easy to follow. Very detailed in instructing you how to move along with the music.
2,Where's the hula?,"If you are looking for authentic cultural Hawaiian hula, this is NOT the video set for you! It is a good workout, but is lacking in Hawaiian traditions. It is an insult to the sacred dance of the hula. The instructor is 1/2 Western Cowgirl, 1/4 body builder, and 1/4 Kumu Hula. Too much time is spent with the camera-man's nose up her skirt, and some of the ""hula"" moves are a bit vulgar compared to how they are traditionally done. Better to go with Patricia Lei's ""Hula for Health"" video if you are looking for graceful, beautiful hula exercise and dance."
2,'A'ole Hiki (impossible!),"In order to do this workout, you must be very coordinated, able to move quickly, and able to look past the distorted variation of hula dancing. You can get a good workout (if you can keep up) but if you're interested in learning hula, this is not the right video. The movement in this video is very fast, rigid, and down right ugly. True traditional hula is a graceful, beautiful expression of mind, body, and spirit that can provide a spiritual and physical workout when performed properly."
3,Good value.,"For the price you pay this is a decent fishfinder. However, even with the updated software the performance of the 240 blue has been disappointing. As long as you do not plan to fish any water deeper than 500 feet, it works well. After 500 feet you lose the reading and you then must circle back into shallower water to regain the signal. Unfortunately, you generally have to go all the way back to about 300 feet of water to actually do this. In shallow water it works well. Just keep in mind that the actual max depth is 500, not 1500, feet when buying."
5,More than satisfied customer,"Have been using this product for several years now, and it is very good at controling my rosacea, just as the ads claim. Found this vendor on line a couple of years ago and have been very pleased with their service and will definitely continue to buy this product from them."
4,Blissful,"Kathleen came to Blissful to escape a domineering family. . When she realized that her newly adopted town was dying too, she presented a daring plan--make Blissful the most wicked town in the West. Bounty hunter Charlie Macon has arrived in town chasing an outlaw . . . a real outlaw. By the time Blissful is turned into the kind of town it should be, Charlie and Kathleen have fallen in love. Leave it to Ms. Estrada to come up with a unique premise for a Western romance."
2,Supply Chain Management,"I typically don't review books, but after seeing these reviews I just had to chime in. I think I took the same class as GPP and agree, it is a hard read. There must be several books out there (Perhaps Lean Distribution by Zylstra) that can teach you just as much but with more down to earth wording. The text example in the review by J. Jericho pretty much sums it up."
1,don't waste your money,"This chest is pressed board with a cheap cedar overlay. I've found it was ""patched"" to cover the defects. This chest is not a good value, save your money! They even expect you to pay another $55 to return it."
4,DVD Movie,"This is one of my favorite Danielle Steel books/movie and I had difficulty finding it. Thanks to Amazon.com, I was able to not only find it but purchase it. I watched it the day it was received. Thank you Amazon for having those hard to find items."
5,Perfect fit,"This battery terminal extender fit like a charm. I purchased it for use in a 1992 Chevy S10 Blazer, which needed the extender after I installed a new headlight system. It fit the battery perfectly, but I had already removed some of the plastic off the positive cable to get the old terminal off, so that may be needed."
2,The book blunders,No refrences are properly cited and much is based on misinformation. The story about W.C. Fields is often quoted but instead of fact is actually based on a joke he told. There is no W.C. Fields missing money. It could have been better researched. But it makes for entertaining stories.
1,Typical,"This book has interesting monologues to read; but as far as using it to find audition material. . .forget it. It is not clearly organized. I like monologue books that are divided into serious, comedic, etc, so I can go straight to the type of monologue I want. But this book is full of monologues with obscure chapter headings that make absolutely no sense. This is not a resourceful book. . .I would use it only for entertainment purposes, but then again, if I time for that, I'd rather read the entire play, rather than an excerpt."
4,Great History Lesson,This book should be taught in all of our schools. Our great grand-daughter study this book in her private school. I remember this in my elementry school years. Check some young person out as to who created the first flag or the discussion on the format of the stars. Thanks again Amazon; Keep up the good work.
4,"good, but not all it's cracked up to be","as with any Opeth album, ""Morningrise"" is very good. However, the first three tracks can get a little boring, especially ""Nectar"". ""Black Rose Immortal"" and ""To Bid You Farewell"" are stellar, though. If you like Opeth, I'd buy this album. If you're just getting into them, i'd get ""Still Life"" or ""Blackwater Park"" instead."
2,"I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me","I love Opeth. I was crushed when I couldn't see them when they toured near me, and I couldn't wait for Lamentations to come out. For some reason though, Morningrise, for all of the things people had to say about it, bored the hell out of me. The songs just droll along and do definitly travel from one point to another, but they never really rise in energy or gain any momentum. It's kind of like an engine idling the whole time. I was just waiting for them to break out with something throughout the whole thing and they never did.The songs didn't seem to flow very well from one riff to the next as if there were just a bunch of riffs written and randomly strung together.I would recommend My Arms, Your Herse or Deliverance to this one. Yes, those two albums are their heavier ones, but they are solid and don't have any of the problems mentioned above."
3,Good music but...,"Yeah, this is good music. Not as original as I expected, but still quite good. One big, big problem though: the vocals. Now don't get me wrong, I like the occasional aggressive growl (Chuck's vocals on Testament's Demonic are simply frightening) but this? The vocals on this album are way too much on the ""barfing my lungs out"" side of things... Now put cleaner vocals on this CD and you're not too far from an instant classic. GRRRAAWWGHHH!!!"
3,Voyage,The Cd Voyage by Christy Moore was promptly sent and arrived within a few days. The music is eay listening and really gives an insight through the lyrics into life in Cork in relatively recent times.
5,movado eliro,"I was alittle worried about buying a Movado on the interent, but emailed amazon and was given a guarentee that the watch was real. I was very impressed on the quick delivery(ground), ups had it to me earlier than what I had asked for. I had the watch in plenty of time for christmas. My girlfriend loves the watch, it is a different look then the rest of the movados and she gets compliments on it everywhere she goes. I would order a watch again."
4,Very enjoyable!,"Easy to use, though at times the buttons can be somewhat on the difficult side to push to control the vibration. Otherwise very nice design, simple but very effective."
1,Save your $$ and get a Pocket Rocket - or ANYTHING else - instead,"Just does NOT get the job done. A simple Pocket Rocket - or pretty much anything else at all - works better.I'm surprised that it's not a better product since Fun Factory is known for quality... not that the quality seems poor, but it just doesn't do the trick, so in my book, that makes it useless and a waste of money..."
5,Comfortable,This material is perfect for everyday use. It is wonderful. It even looks pretty too. I would recommend this product.
4,Colombia golden age the real deal,"These sound like the original artists, hits from the 60s and 70s that I used to hear at latin parties with all kinds of south americans, not just colombians, who considered a lot of these ""classics"" for party music. It has a good variety, moving from salsa to cumbia to other rhythms. . .fun. I think colombian music is way underappreciated in northamerica; we mostly hear only NY/PR salsa if any. I like to listen to it while driving or doing something active but I don't think the mix has quite the right flow to be a fantastic party record on its own."
1,This video stinks,"I tried this tape once and got nothing even remotely resembling a workout, because the entire time I was standing in one spot, halfheartedly swaying my hips while scratching my head in bewilderment (simultaneously!).Note to the makers of this video: Next time, it *might* be a good idea to actually show the lower half of the instructor's body. Some of us weren't taught hula in the womb, and need to be, I don't know - instructed, perhaps?This video is really bad."
1,What a waste of paper & time!,"I learned how valuable time is , by wasting it reading a long useless book like this!"
5,Scholarly Work that is Understandable,"This is a very scholarly work but is well written, easy to understand and very informative about an aspect of the ancient Greek culture. I wish Dr. Reed would do more. I'd sure read it."
5,Still a great computer language...,"Sadly the Plus language isn't available for most of the hardware which exists these days, but it was a top-notch language for systems-programming purposes."
5,Born on the 4th of July,Tom Cruise did a great job in this movie. It's a story about Viet Nam injured Vets and how they were treated & the poor condition of the VA hospitals and how one Vet fought the system.
4,EXCELLENT,"this was a great movie, and I love the ending. The acting was great, the story was wonderful, and the sets/etc. were so believable. I am amazed at what a great job Tom Cruise did."
1,Acting GREAT : Movie NOT SO GREAT,The Acting of Tom Cruise was absolutely wonderful! The facts and Chronilogical order of the Vietnam Conflict should have been researched instead of created. Acting of Cruise was GREAT the movie itself WAS NOT.
3,Did not get the hype,"I needed to review the movie for a project, did not understand what all the hype was about.The movie was predictable."
3,these reviewers just don't get it...,"I read the earlier reviews of this cd and I do agree in principle with their arguments. It seems, however, that they are reviewing this cd as if it is a pop, or bubblegum R&B cd, which is totally unfair. This cd is about addictions of the human experience, so therefore, all of the tunes shouldn't be polished and melodic. Award the artists for trying to articulate the feelings of those in chemical and/or sexual bondage (Ghetto Heaven) or those addicted to a person (In Summer I Fall, The Last Temptation), scold the marketing department for not knowing how to get this music to the masses. The major fault of this cd may be that there were too many ideas and too much experimentation. Save the harmonies for The Carpenters!!"
1,Cheap wire remote cat,"I thought this was an outfit for the icat, it is not. It is a cheap robot cat with a remote that connects the cat to the remote. What a rip off. Amazon should require a picture or take this off their site. Now I'm stuck with something I'll just give to goodwill or I have to pay the shipping back. Shoot!!!"
1,broken,"We received this item as a holiday gift and the granite sections were broke. I called amazon, and they said too bad, I could return the whole thing for a gift certificate. Since it weighed 70 lbs and the packaging was destroyed unpaking it, we are stuck. The pieces could not be replaced. bummer."
4,reasonable buy,"When i first say this watch, i was thinking to myself... wow this watch looks great... and the functions are not bad either... but i was worried about the price. It is not that i dont like cheap stuff, but sometimes, i am just worried when something seems too good to be true. Afterall, you get what you pay for... and i did. Once i got the watch, i looked at it, and it looks great. This watch looks really really good, but once i picked it up, i realized why it was only 24$. Even though it looks expensive, the watch feels really cheap. Nevertheless, i still really like this watch. Just let your friends see it but not touch it."
3,Nice effect,This light is nice but if you have a bigger than an 8 foot pool than you might need 3 or 4 lights
3,BNC male to binding post adaptor,Does not have a standard 3/4 inch center to center distance. Otherwise a good product. This would have been a five star product if not for the center distance.
3,Seljuk costumes,"Excellent little book on with Turkish Illustrations. A little of everything. Good starting point for SCA Middle Eastern costumes. If you can't afford the usual $300 dollar books, this is good to have in your library. But, it isn't a must have. The book is small and so are the illustrations. (Album of the Conqueror, Book of Accomplishments, Book of the King of Kings, Book of the Festival, 28 various plates total.)"
4,Almost great,"It does the job and works for the person I bought it for. It's main flaw is that at its lowest setting, it's still a couple if inches high for proper leverage. There are a lot of short people out there and this needs to go a notch lower."
4,Medline Safety Rails,"These are a little wobbly and I do occasionally trip over them. However, they do serve their purpose well ( recovery from hip surgery). My husband was able to install them without difficulty. The width can be adjusted, but not the height. While you are shopping, don't forget to get your reacher."
4,Good support,"Like all the adjustable features. Easier to install. I paired this with a separate raised toilet seat for my father and it worked out perfectly for him. Like others, I found the legs were wobbly when moved left to right, but that doesn't really matter since the stability is strong for the actual act of standing up and sitting down. Dad feels more confident when going to the bathroom now, and I feel like it's more safe, so we are both happy with the purchase."
5,Best Exercise For Life!,Dr. Schwartz was a very kind & compassionate fellow! Not only did he develop the Heavy Hands Program-He went on to thoroughly test & research its performance and how it compared to most every other exercise option! Great System from a Great Man!
2,Too Many Mistakes,"I've worked with a lot of exercise DVDs and this one has the most instructor mistakes of them all. She confuses herself, she confuses her team and she confused me. On the plus side, the routine is not hard to learn; it's moderately challenging as far as being complex. There are lots of arm movements so your arms get a good workout. I still use it when I want a change of pace. I work out every day 30 - 90 minutes and rotate my exercise DVDs."
5,Lambada,A fun dance movie with a different story line. A math teacher takes a real interest in teaching students that have difficulty with school as opposed to boy meets girl. Dance is part of him that helps connect him with the kids. He is a great example for the kids and has wonderful ethics. A feel good movie with great dancing.
3,hoyle casino texas hold-em poker,"i purchased the hoyle casino cd on amazon and the seller was terrific. i paid bottom dollar, received a response from my email from the seller right away and it came in the mail quickly. couldn't have gone smoother or any better. howevever this wasn't the cd i was looking for afterall. apparently there are several with texas hold-em but each cd has a different variation. so the reason i rated it with 3 stars is only because it wasn't the particular one i wanted."
5,from a Civil War medicine museum docent,"I'm a master docent ... and I love this book. The book does a terrific job of blasting the stereotypes which often portray doctors of the time as either incompetent or uncaring. Civil War surgeons were not ""saw happy"" and, with rare exceptions, soldiers on the edge of the battlefield were sufficiently anesthetized during all surgical procedures. Dr. Bollet establishes both of these facts right up front. Bollet's book does a wonderful job of clearing up the picture of medicine during this American conflict. In the decade before the war, surgeons at Massachusett's General Hospital performed, on average, fewer than 200 operations each year; during the war, surgeons would perform in excess of 40,000 operations. A great deal was learned in the process, and Bollet recounts it all. As a museum docent, I am reading this book with highlighter in hand. ..."
2,Toast Oven,This oven toaster is ok for the price. Door is hard to handle because it lies flat when open. But it does toast well. Timer is noisey.
1,not so good,"I guess it works,one problem the rack is on a slant one side is higher than the other. Watch what you are toasting or cooking. I would have sent it back if I noticed it sooner"
5,Excellent Baroque Music,"I bought this CD solely on the basis of a review in Klassik Heute and have never regretted it; it is one of the most-played albums in my CD collection. Although the solo instrument is the oboe throughout, each concerto has a very distinct character, so the music never seems repetitive. The ordering of the concertos is well thought out, so if you listen to the CD from beginning to end, you hear a coherent program, not a jumble. Dombrecht is a real master of the Baroque oboe, and his cantabile playing alone is worth the price. This album is an especial treat if you love Vivaldi but are only familiar with his string concertos."
1,Absolutely not recommended,"The product comes bundeled with good software. However, the scanner itself has serious issues. Most notably, scan speed and feeder reliability. Making things worst, clearing a paper jam is a significant amount of time. I did not realize how terrible a product this is until I bought a Fujitsu S510 (from Amazon). The difference is night and day. The fujitsu is extremely easy to use, fast, and reliable. When it jam, it is straight forward to clear the jam."
2,Keep looking,"I have had problems with this scanner and document jams in the adf also...and they are regular 8.5 x 11 sheets. I have also had problems with a blue line running through my docs (if in color, grey if in b/w)and there is no way to clean the glass. The printer does not even arrive with perfectly clean glass so everything has smudges all over it."
1,Grabage,"Doesn't scan, doesn't feed. Doesn't accept software that is for scanning. Doesn't come with appropriate scanner software. I was surprised. We use a lot of HP products and generally have been satisfied. This one is the exception. It really is trash. $700 down the toilet. Tha's what I paid from Amazon. As you can see these now cost less, and I can understand why. Still a lower price for something that doesn't work is no bargain."
3,sheets,did not end up being the sheets i had hoped for with the imprinted steeler logo. instead the imprint is NFL with a football. the only steelers design is on the pillow case which is bothersome to put your face against. also the material is a stretch cotton and you must be careful with it in the dryer for shrinkage and for the design.
4,Stocking Stuffer,My son will be so happy on Christmas morning since he has been asking for Diesel 10 for weeks now!
3,Must buy for Thomas fans,"Despite the fact that, this is a conspirator, an ill-willed, lying, unreliable character, if your child is a Thomas fanatic, s/he will be very happy to watch Day of the Diesels while holding this toy in her little hand. For some reason, children loved the Diesel 10 character just like they liked the arrogant and snob Spencer character when Hero of the Rails was out. The claw is not functional but I see that as a plus. A bit expensive as it is a hot topic now, but was worth the price to see my daughter with that kind of smile when we gave it to her."
3,Claw is disappointing,"The claw is the main attraction of Diesel 10. In this toy it only slides forward and back - there is no up or down movement and the claw jaws do not open and close. This is a huge drawback because that's why the kids love Diesel 10. My 3 year old plays with it, but not to the extent he would be if it could do more. Remember, this toy is only a few inches long. It fit the track system, but I think my son would have been happier with a different character - it was VERY anticlimactic to have a non-functioning claw."
2,Keep looking,"As a doctor trying to expand my spanish vocabulary, I was disappointed with this dictionary. The words it has are just the very basic medical terms and it is sorely lacking in any specialty vocabulary. For example it doesn't havethe word cancer or injection, and no names for surgical procedures either. Keep looking."
4,A fast paced adventure,Set in the near future this is a thought provoking technothiller well worth a read.
5,Best book I've read all year,"I received Susan Bulkeley Butler's book so I could interview her for an article in her hometown newspaper, The Abingdon Argus. Honestly, I didn't think it would capture my attention but I was SO wrong! This book is fantastic! I felt as though Susan was speaking to me. For so many years I've waited for things to happen to me, but as Susan says, don't wait for things to happen to you, make them happen. I can't wait to apply the principles of Become the CEO of You, Inc., to my every day life."
1,Makes pain WORSE,"This stuff not only does not work as advertised - it makes gum pain WORSE. I'm experiencing a lot of gum pain and irritation following oral surgery. When I used Rincinol as directed, the irritation and pain got much worse. Note that such pain caused by ""Oral Surgery"" is one of the symptoms this medicine is supposed to resolve.Save your money. Do NOT buy this total rip-off."
5,Amazing product - makes canker sores bearable,I had an outbreak of canker sores that started off my weekend. After using this product on Saturday mid day and then before going to bed my sores are much less painful and I can actually eat pretty normally without much pain. Unsure at this time if this product actually makes them heal more quickly but just being able to eat a meal without every bite hurting makes it well worth the price.
5,The only mistake...was not a mistake,"I remember watching this on a big screen at the cinema!! If it's shocking on dvd, imagine on a big screen!Anyway, the only thing i did NOT like was that NOBODY could believe that such a beautiful woman as Monica Belucci could date such an ugly guy. And later I found out they are married in real life!By the way: I just watched on my dvd for the 3rd time in several years, and found out it's not right guy who gets the revenge after all! (the one who rapes Monica B)And for those who think the rape scene is explotation: I think it actually helps MEN REALIZE HOW TERRIBLE A RAPE IS. Once you watch that with such realism you understand how bad of an experience it is for a woman.Kudos for Monica Belucci for being such a brave actress as to act an endless rape scene, no cuts. Not very many would dare to go through that."
5,Warning!,"This film is one of the most explicit movies I've ever seen. It is a great movie, but I wouldn't recomend it to the soft hearted. My wife had cried in disgust during a rape seen. Enough said. Great movie, not for kids."
4,One Seemingly Innocent Wrong Move And It All Spirals Out Of Control !,"""Irreversible"" is a perfect exercise in dangerously original filmmaking.The film is a thriller like no other and is disturbingly hard to watch, both physically and mentally. The camera is constantly twisting, turning and jumping as to compliment/run parallel with the emotional and truly disturbing content in the film. Evryone involved did a great job, you couldn't ask for a better preformance by the actors. Monica Bellucci is an amazing actress, it also does not hurt that she happends to be one of the most beautiful creatures on the planet. Vincent Cassel is simply one of the most underrated actors in showbiz. ""Irreversible"" is yet another french masterpiece that belongs in every Horror/thriller fans collection."
1,Major Disburbing,"To say this movie is disburbing is a major understatement. I was so dizzy from the first 10 minutes, I got sick; but that was nothing for what was to come. I wish time was reversible to where I could go back and not see this one."
1,"stink,stank,stunk","This movie rates NO stars!!! A real,real bad movie!!! A""gag me with a spoon"" movie."
1,disturbing,"Disturbing not just for the pointless violence, but disturbing that there are people running around, unrestrained, that would even consider making a movie like this. Ridiculous spinning around and round with the camera....for what? Pointless violence and profanity...like a junior high school dropout made this ""movie"". ""Selling"" this piece of crap with this beautiful and sexy actress and promising graphic sex...should be against the law.If this depicts something that actually goes on in the world, why glorify it by making a ""movie"" about it? Leave it in the gutter where it belongs, please. Absolutely no socially redeeming qualities at all here."
3,Reverse It,"When I watched this film, I already new that it was shot in reverse order from all the reviews I have read previously and I still had problems keeping up at times. What also made it confusing was the way the scences were shot, with the camera always spinning around and having to read the subtitles while trying to pay attention to learning characters and plot details. I found the ending or shoud I say the beginning powerful yet bittersweet because Marcus himself didn't get his revenge personally. The film was good enough and held my interest anyway, but I suggest watching it a second time, but this time in reverse order from the last chapter to the first to fully see what you have may have missed."
2,Oppressive and disturbing,"This film reminded me of Man Bites Dog, another film that made me feel sick. But this is possibly worse than MBD. Irreversible is gimmicky pretentious camera work and oppressive soundtrack which makes you want to throw up, and an unnecessarily long rape scene which is only one of the scenes of sordid and sickening violence. There is something peculiarly poignant about how it ends, but it is not enough to redeem the film. Monica Belluci is amazing, especially in the play of emotions over her pregnancy test. But again, not enough to redeem a film that is essentially designed to shock and disturb. Life can be pretty grim as it is without even grimmer fiction thrown in for good measure. It may be worth seeing this once for academic interest, but only just. If you want to be kind to yourself, don't (it is not going to enrich your life)."
1,Don't waste your time or money....,"I liked Memento, but this was really something else. It's bad camera angles, super shaky shots, overly dark choppy frames, and the bizarre music, it was awful. Not to mention the story wasn't developed, and you don't end up caring about anyone. Besides the extremely long and graphic rape scene, which I agree is horrific, you just watch and kinda' wish the whole stupid movie was over."
3,DVD,"Got the DVD and seems I was wrong about the ending and also wrong about whether or not the Tenia cashes in his chips. I love the warning on the cover about flashing lights. No warning about the sordid violence giving you a heart attack. Sign of the times? Originally thought the film was some sort of throwback to the radical feminist rants of the seventies but subsequently discovered it was all improvised (rather well, in fact.) Overall, my memory of this film will be, despite it's horrors, one of laughter. Black comedy slowly giving away to the more lighthearted and touching humour of human relationships. The sixties decor of the lover's flat which I took to be a subtext of the permissivness of the sixties leading to ultimate disaster may be no more than a tribute to the director's favourite director. Sometimes you can read too much into things. 'Irreversible' is definately worth a look."
1,"Extremely Starting , Raw and Unnecessary/Over the Line.",This movie is Extremely Raw and Graphic with a disturbing rape scene. If you are going to watch it please be cautioned that it's startling. I wish I could unsee the movie.unnecessary
1,Horrific. DON'T WATCH.,"I am telling you and warning you, this is the most horrific, disturbing, depressing, and EFFECTIVE film ever committed to celluloid. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. I watched it because I heard all the hype about it, and I am sure that is the reason you will watch it too.All I can say is that it is probably the only film out there that I might tell someone not to watch. I am not calling this a bad film or a good film. It is effective. During the rape scene you feel like you are right there with Monica Belucci. After I watched it I wanted to go out and kill someone with my bare hands, I was bloodthirsty. I was so angry that such things can be done to innocent people. I have never had such an emotional response to a film, and I watch A LOT of films. It made me feel like the world was a horrible place filled with horrific people. Not a good feeling. I will never watch this film again. Proceed at your own risk."
1,Irreversible: A French Turd! Absolute Shi*t!,"Definitely DO NOT buy this DVD! It's total CRAP! ( RUBBISH ).The whole story goes backwards from the beginning of the DVD. ie: It opens at the ""Ending"" of the story and as the DVD progresses forward normally, the scenes go backwards!! There is a horrific, graphic 20 minute rape scene in the story, where a very beautiful young woman is raped ( doggy style ) in the subway. It's quite violent too! Give it a miss! A Sick French Film! A French Turd! That's what you get when you buy this DVD!"
1,Just plain awful!,"Worst film I've seen in a long time...don't waste your money, this is just plain junk...bad camera angles and poor photography that trys to subsitute violence and sex for talent...the story unfolds in reverse...Who ever told this guy he could make movies, lied...."
2,a bit over the top,"actors in this movie are better than the gimmick of brutality, etc. that's in this. move along...nothing to see here."
1,Woman-hating,"This film is exploitation at its worst. Not only indulging in rape but also locating the film's ultimate trauma in the woman's hidden pregnancy, as if rape is not a violent enough act when the victim isn't pregnant. Disgusting, and everyone who likes this film scares the hell out of me."
3,Holy Cow!,This movie is disturbing. I can see how the shock factor and such might appeal to some. If you somehow are a spectator of the dark side of humanity then you might enjoy this. This film should have it's own rating. lol.
2,You will feel pain.,"I understand Noe's philosophy and reasoning for making this film... other reviewers have covered this. Violence portrayed as reality rather than entertainment, etc. etc. Sure, I get it. But the fact remains that the filmaker(s) refuse(s) to allow there to be any hope or faith in humanity. The banality and beauty in the ending scene (the first chrologically) between the romantically linked characters illustrates NOTHING. Apparently, we are all predestined... which is a trite and infuriating belief system as far as I'm concerned. One does not need to BELIEVE in what a film SAYS in order to LIKE it, I realize... the message of this film is simply too childish for me.I believe that this film was important for some people to see... hell, I believe it was well made for the most part. However, being able to recommend it is a whole other story. It's simply too painful and stupid at base."
4,A MUST PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a very good R&B cd. I haven't heard music that sounds this good since the Maxwell Urban Hang Suite. A vert refreshing style of music. For all you bass lovers, track no. 6 Frayne's Soul Lounge, Pt. 1 is some killer bass playing. Please do not sleep on this cd it will be a shame to all music lovers."
4,bigdad44,Was surprised the quality of music. Great variety of R & B and jazz. Should of expected it with son of Ramsey Lewis involved. Obviously it didn't get much exposure because they should have definately done a follow-up.
4,"Like the size, not the plug part","I love the 3' size, but the actual plug that goes into the wall is not a straightplug type. It is a flat type and because of such, takes up more then one spot on a multi-plug receptical, not as convienant for me, but if you want a flat flush type, this is for you."
3,Can't be used in small space,"Before you buy this cord, make sure you will have enough room to the right of your outlet for the whole flat plug. The picture shows how the plug angles to the right. I bought this to use in the outlet in a bathroom light, but there's no space between the outlet and the wall."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't waste your money on this one unless you want to watch people setting up the festival. You get to see one song from Genesis.That's it. The rest is a bunch of talk, and not even to the musicians.A complete waste of time and money."
5,"Believable characters, plot, and wonderful witty voice","The sensitive, brooding, witty protagonist in an attempt to better his condition falls prey to misfortune. He gains our sympathy and we root for him. His clever sense of humor helps him survive. A believable character and plot, set in the 70's brings us back to that period with accuracy. With pleasure, I look forward to the next in the series."
1,Skip if you're not a beginner,"If you are not new to yoga and consider yourself intermediate to advanced, you will be wasting your money if you purchase this DVD. Although the view is perfect and the crashing waves are serene and soothing, for the more experienced yogi, this workout DOES NOT make you sweat. Additionally, this DVD does not showcase true vinyasa flow yoga. Rainbeau does not flow, but rather fidgets into, throughout and out of every single pose. Her voice is also quite annoying, and it definitely does not leave you in a calm and peaceful state of mind after completion. I did not find this DVD to be challenging, a workout or pure sweat. If you would like to sweat, build muscle, increase cardiovascular endurance and flexibility, and lose weight/keep in shape then this DVD is not for you. Instead try ashtanga yoga - that is definitely a weight reducing, sweat producing, muscle building type of yoga."
5,Milagro Entertainment Acquires the Film and Television Right,"Milagro Entertainment, Inc., is pleased to announce that it has acquired the Film and Television rights for Two books titled ""Madam President"" and the ""Hooligan Navy"" from the writer Wesley E Hall."
3,Not terrible.,"I bought this camera while saving up for a Nikon D50 (It was cheap, and I really needed SOMETHING to take pictures with, as my other camera had bit the dust) and was pleasantly surprised by it. It takes brilliant macros and it also performs wonderfully outside. If you can get outside and play with this thing, you won't be dissapointed.That's not to say there aren't a few problems. For instance, the flash is worthless, and I found myself loading up on off-camera light so I wouldn't have to use it. But at 150 dollars, I was willing to just deal with that. It truly is a bargain."
2,Very blurry photos,"I've spent a lot of time figuring out how to use this camera and I found that the only ways to get a good photo are to use flash, use sports mode, or black and white mode. Using sports mode, you have to have very good lighting, like outdoors. All of the other modes - museum, beach, even auto mode got me a blurry photo almost every time when I held it with my hand. My hands aren't even very shaky."
2,depends on what you expect,"If you expect a cheap camera with limited functionality and picture-taking that will only work in good light, then this is a good camera for you.When we purchased the camera, I didn't expect that it would be as bad as it is indoors. It truly does poorly any time the flash is involved unless you're using the flash as a fill-in flash.Outdoors, in good light, it does reasonably well. Otherwise, it's a pretty lousy camera."
1,Voice Message Expansion Card,"I received the card wrapped in NON static proof plastic ""AS IF IT CAME FROM SOMEONES JUNK DRAWER"" .. I've never got the card to work. I'm not going to buy electronics from them again.. I've accepted the fact that I'm stuck with it! $$$$"
2,Not detailed enough when needed.,"As a new user to Quicken, I could figure out enough of the basics using on-line help. When I wanted more detailed info on tracking investments, the book basically mirrored the on-line help. And neither one could give me the answer. Other topics were better though. One thumb down."
3,"OK, but not great","If you are new to financial management software, this book explains how to start from scratch with Quicken 99. If you are a previous Quicken user or even MYM like me, there isn't much here. Quicken's on line help gave me 3 answers to every 1 that I got from this book."
5,Reviewed Transaction on February 7.,"woodys-books 5 out of 5 ""ordered Jan. 30, received Feb. 7"" February 7, 2008I (5*****)rated this transaction on February 7th, [date of receipt]. Requesting 2nd and 3rd reviews is puzzling. I was pleased with the condition and timeliness of it's receipt. I have no further comments."
3,Didn't Fit,"I'm an occupational therapist working with a man who has pretty significant tremors. We tried this product and while it is weighted very well, and is very thick for easy grasping, I had a very difficult time trying to find a pen that would fit into it. Just know that any pen other than a very, very basic generic pen or any wooden lead pencil will fit in this holder. Turns out my patient had none of these in his home and when we finally found one that worked with it, I think my patient was disenchanted and we sent it back.This holder does come with a big pencil (like the big one in the pic) but try handing a huge kindergarten pencil like that to your geriatric patient who is grasping at his dignity. Didn't work for me. Hope it works for you."
3,Just didn't really interest me!,"I thought I would love this book, I really wanted to love this book! After reading Katherine I was sure I would. Unfortunately, I just could never seem to ""get into"" it enough. The premise of the story just didn't interest me in the beginning or the end. I got tired of reading about tragedy after tragedy that fell upon the main character. The poor woman could hardly catch a break. I did learn something about the religious intolerance of the early settlers. The hypocrisy of those who leave one place to escape religious intolerance only to bring it full force to a new place, however, did not escape me. All in all though I just didn't really connect with this book like I thought I would!"
3,Not her best,"I'm a big fan of mysteries and Donna Leon, but this particular book moved too slowly. I lost interest."
1,Not Compatible with all G series lenses,"This very expensive Teleconverter is not compatible with the 300G 4.56 Telephoto Lens, It will not even connect and allow you to work in Manual Mode. It will connect to the G 400mm lens in Manual mode. I am sending mine back to Amazon. Very disappointed."
4,As goofy as I remembered..,"It is a suprise that many people don't know about this movie, it is kind of like it does not exist. Even on the Meatloaf specials on VH1 and E! they neglect even a mention of the movie, which was a highlight of Meatloaf's career after not being able to record the followup release to Bat out of Hell (forgot how to sing).Loaded with guest performances, check it out..."
1,If this sucked any more it would be a black hole,"Even if you love Alice Cooper and Meat Loaf... in fact, especially if you love them both (as I do) you will hate this movie. The writing and acting is horrible which is somewhat unforgivable because Mr. Loaf gives a stunningly great performance in Focus and, of course, his memorable job in Fight Club. Not to mention he had enough talent to score parts in Hair and The Rocky Horror Show. Where is that talent here?It could be the abysmal writing. It could be a total lack of direction.Even the music sucks. This movie could have been very good and lots of fun but in every way possible, it not only falls short but is downright painful."
3,Good watch but easily gets scratched,"This is a warch with quite a lot of features. If you loose your manual, then you are doomed. Once, it took me 1 month to adjust the analog time just because i lost the manual :)The backlight is really cool. I love the auto backlight on when you tilt the watch to 45. But, 95% of the features are not useful to day-to-day life. Even to get an accurate temperature, you need to remove the watch from your hand and keep it aside for atleast 10 mins.Saying all these, i am proud to say that my watch has all these features. Helps me to show off infront of my techy friends.The worst part of the watch is that it easily gets scratched. It becomes very ugly and now i hate to wear the watch. I would have give 5 stars. But, the scratches makes the watch useless after 12-18 months. May be it might last longer to people who handle them more delicately."
4,A very nice watch!,"I'm very satisfied with this watch, it's nice, elegant or casual depends on what you wear with it. The termomether makes it interesting and the analog-digital is perfect!"
2,buy the white background one,"The black background on this watch makes it very difficult to see without using the light.Also, the temp is not accurate without taking the watch off because your body temp translates through the metal casingO yeah, unless you have tree trunk arms, you will have to pay a repairman to remove the links in the band = add $5-10"
3,Good book....but to expensive,"As a student who is just starting to become familiar with security concepts I have found this book to be great guide towards getting my security+ certification. This book explains things clearly and does a good job at explaining why the information is needed. I'm only giving it 3 stars since I don't feel that after reading it I'll be ready for CompTIA's test but it does give me a good grasp on the basics and terminology so that other books will be easier to understand.The only reason I bought this book is because it was for a class, otherwise I would have chosen a different book mainly because I feel the price is too high. But I did learn a lot from this book and time permitting I will most likely read through parts of it again."
3,not the best quality for the money,"I am disappointed in the quality of this table, I think for the money I should have built my own, however it did save me the time to not deal with laminating my own mdf material, the table is a flat plane no warps...which is the good thing the down side is they mounted wood rail stiffeners to the bottom of the table for mounting puposes. They didn't mount them in alignment with the edge of the table causing me the additional work of shimming for a corect fence and table surface to saw table surface mount....no real biggie but for the money the should have gotten that right, so it lowers my opinion of the product I give them a 3"
2,laminate over wood frame,"It's a 1/4 sheet of high pressure over a wood frame for $169.00 The ""table"" is flat and the correct size, which is just how it should be, but for only $25.00 (what it's worth) You'd think that when someone is spending $500.00 for a fence system, mobile base and table legs they would give them a break on the price. And if you figure they just spent $2000.00 on a new cabinet saw the company would be greatful. No, they want more. Delta USED to be a brand to be proud of. Not anymore. Now if you buy this brand, you look like a sucker seeing how the other companys are making higher quality products for less. Amazing how greed can destroy a companys reputation."
2,"At best, an extremely pricey handbook","Although the editorial review claims that Perl for Bioinformatics ""introduces Perl to the bio/computer scientist interested in or working in bioinformatics,"" this is really a bit of a misnomer. While it does contain a decent quantity of useful, relevant reference information for a bioinformatics student, the (dollar) price tag is far too high. Furthermore, no real introduction to Perl is found in the book, save the preface in pp. 4-5--that is to say, some basic knowledge of Perl will be an absolute requirement. As a student, I would personally lean toward any of the excellent O'Reilly bioinformatics and/or Perl books myself; they are well written, contain much of the same relevant information with additional explanations, and at a much lower price per page. Bottom line: You may find Perl for Bioinformatics useful as a pocket reference guide, but it is probably not worth the astronomical price."
4,CSI NY Seasons 1-7,Enjoyed watching these dvds and keeping up with a very good television series. I would recommend them to any CSI addict like me.
4,CSI-NY Seasons 1-7.,My only regret was getting a set w/o subtitles. I am otherwise very pleased with the quality of the DVD's. Wil continue to use Amazon in the future.
2,"""product dimensions"" are smaller than shown here","This playboard is fine. It looks nice, is sturdy and, according to other reviewers, seems to do well over time. Prospective buyers should be aware, however, that the ""Product Dimensions"" as given on this page are actually the dimensions of the box the playboard is delivered in. The real product dimensions are 48"" x 32"". Unfortunately, I built a table for the dimensions as given thinking the ""product"" dimensions were actually the measurements of the ""product,"" i.e., the playboard itself. Nope. Now my sons have a some extra room around the border, which isn't all bad, but I thought you should know."
4,A good yarn,Light the fireplace and enjoy this good old fashioned Western. The characters are well drawn and the story a good if familiar one.
3,"Flint, western novel by Louis L'Amour","Flint is a good, solid L'Amour western tale and in typical L'Amour fashion pits obvious good against obvious evil. However, the main character is someone the reader never really gets to know very well. I found the plot mechanics L'Amour uses make the story jumpy and confusing, with the flow interrupted by unnecessary flashbacks to a long-dead character. The battle between good and evil is a good one, and the main character's internal conflicts are interesting, and poignant, but I found myself losing the thread of the story too often in these side issues. Nonetheless, a good western book and fun to read but not L'Amour's best by any means."
5,One of the best blues-based Rock,I place this album in the same league as Led Zep's 'four signs' album and AC/DC's 'Back in Black'.
5,One of THEE greatest CDs out there.,"I was familiar with Badlands back in the day but was recently turned back on to them. This CD flat out rocks ! It's got it all, fast paced rockers, bluesy ballads and arena rock anthems. Jake E Lee really shows his other side after being is Ozzy's band and Ray Gillen is one of the best rock singers out there (RIP)If you are fan of rock music ... you must own this CD."
3,"Amazing guitar work, songwriting not so amazing","I bought this one through amazon, after reading great reviews. They really are very good, Jake E. Lee is one of the best guitar players around. But, the songs are not as good as I expected. If you are a guitar player, buy it. Otherwise I reccomend Zakk Wylde's Pride and glory. It's very good technically and has great songs in it."
1,Not worth the money,"The only positive thing I can say about this coffeemaker is it looks great, until the enamel above the burner plate starts bubbling and peeling off. The stop and pour function never did work perfectly, however it did brew an excellent cup of coffee. Ours died after a short year and a half, not what I expect for the money paid."
2,Won't last long,"For a year and a half, this coffee maker would have earned 5 stars. I bought it for it's solid construction and as a side benefit, it made darned good coffee. Then I noticed some blistering in the plastic lid that covers the water well. I guess the water heating element had melted it, making me wonder what kind of hot-plastic chemicals were seeping into my coffee. Then the burner plate started to peel...dramatically. I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could purchase a replacement cover for the water well and they never responded. It's gone to the landfill now and I've switched to a manual drip cone over an insulated carafe.Greener and cheaper."
4,I LIKE THIS ONE,"For some reason, I really do like this mini-series show. It's really touching and it's kind of like a guilty pleasure. I just have to view this every once in a while -- and I enjoy it!!!"
3,"Why define the characters with such ""butch"" & ""femme"" traits","This book could have been a very good romance/mystery story, but I was a little annoyed by the authors decision to make the ""Ranger"", Miki so overtly masculine that i was constantly asking myself....what does Christina see in her. The only physical traits the author describes for Miki is that she is 6ft tall and has short straight brown/blonde hair. But for the ""femme"" character, christina, we are told she has the ""figure of a model with a small waist"" and that her eyes are black and she has a long graceful neck that her looks are equal to Nefertiti. The book contradicts itself because the character Miki states that looks have never been important to her in a lover and yet she falls in love with a woman who looks like a woman whose name means ""beautiful one"", Neferiti. Miki describes Christina as a willow that bends easily and needs to be protected. In short I found the book to be sexist and the characters one dimensional."
2,Beware of seller,"I've purchased DayWhite from other vendors and never had a problem with the product. When I ordered from SmileMedic, I was unable to get a specific product expiration date from them, only that it would be 12-18 months. I believe I got a faulty product because I've had trouble with the syringe tips popping off and the gel oozing into the case while being stored which exposes the remaining gel to air and ruins it. Also, the unopened tubes seem to have lost their potency despite having several months left on the expiration date. I found SmileMedic difficult to communicate with from the very beginning because they did not know everything about the product they are selling and will buy elsewhere in the future. It's too much like talking to a wall to attempt an exchange at this point. Though I'll take a loss on this purchase, SmileMedic has lost a repeat customer."
2,Battery doesn't last long,"I liked the watch while it lasted. Very attractive styling. But about a year later, well before I'd be replacing a conventional battery, the solar battery now doesn't hold a charge for long. I've had to reset everything twice in the last week. Solar power isn't saving you anything with this watch."
2,Only for a beginner,"First let me say, Ned Davis Research does excellent work. I was hoping to get some insight into the types of research his company uses. But I'm sorry to say I can not recomend this book to anyone but those completely unfamiliar with sentiment analysis. Only the basics are covered. Over half of the book is stock charts showing fundamental variables (I thought this was about sentiment?) and is a waste of space. He does say he is using these variables as a measure of investor sentiment but maybe they could have used a handful of charts as examples, not over half a book that is only 170 pages long."
2,The Nadir of the CSN career,"Firstly I'd like to say that this is not a live album - as described here. Its a studio ablum from 1990. frankly, its quite bad. The production is very very cheesy - synths, wimpy drums etc. With a different production - perhaps simple acoustic guitars - this album could be rescued. There are 3 quite good songs on the album - Haven't We Lost Enough, Yours and Mine and After The Dolphin. These guys can sing almost as good today as they could in 1969 - a sparse backing track instead of the awful 80's synth/drum tripe would've been lovely. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to buy the Box-Set (which contains the 3 aforementioned songs), or a fanatic who must own all their stuff - otherwise i wouldn't bother - Buy ""Crosby, Stills Nash"", ""Deja Vu"", ""CSN"", ""Daylight Again"", ""American Dream"", ""After The Storm"" or ""Looking Forward"" first - they're all better albums."
2,Their weakest album,"This is Crosby, Stills, & Nash's weakest album. They venture too far into pop and not enough rock on this one. The most interesting song on it is ""After The Dolphin"" where Nash seems to try to remake the C&N classic ""Last Whale"". All-in-all, this is a very forgettable album. Recommended for hardcore CSN fans only."
1,Mine lasted less than 6 months,It is a sleek and sharp-looking box but fails at performance. My 500 GB drive lasted for less than six months under very low usage (once or twice a week for backup) and optimal conditions.I got it checked and found that the electronics are still working but the drive (made by Hitachi) is completely dead. The technician says keep away from Hitachi drives.
2,Wrong Jersey!,"Just received this pkg today-had wrong jersey (Jets-Revis #24)! This wouldn't usually bother me because I can return it, but I bought this as a Christmas present, so now I'm hoping they have the Urlacher jersey size I'm looking for. So much for shopping early!"
3,"May work for you, it didn't for me...","I had a problem with the arbors, they fit very loose on all my rifles, I was mainly looking to be ""on paper"" at 50 yards, but this boresighter was not the answer, I thought I could make it work, but all the adjustments were off, I mean, way off. It is still sitting on a shelf."
5,Another great one for beginning coaches!,"Along with the other books which I purchased through Amazon.com, this one has been excellent for creating swim workouts for my high school team. There are specific workouts for various techniques, which makes it easy to locate exactly what my swimmers need. I then adjust the workout to their needs and away they swim! Highly recommend this for a swim team or individual."
5,A very important guide to help amateur swimmers.,It is a perfect book to read for those who want to workout their skills in swimming and don't have a coach. The workouts are excellent and they are divided in three ascending levels. Read it and swim it!
3,Fan noise,"The convection fan vibrates the thinly constructed oven to the point that you might not want to use it just to avoid the racket. It is an advantage, though, if you want to be reminded the oven is on even if you are in another part of the house. Also, if you ever want to pull toast off of the oven grate be sure to have oven mits handy since there is no handle included to pull the grate out far enough to reach inside without branding your hand."
2,average book,It is an average book but there is no better book on websphere as per date 26 aug 2002if you find a better choice in future please do not buy this book.
3,Broad and Shallow,"The bulk of the book is dedicated to general J2EE topics. Relatively little information is provided in regards to WebSphere. If you are wanting to learn about J2EE/EJB and an intro to WebSphere, this might be a good book. If you have plenty of books on J2EE and looking for in-depth information on WebSphere, this is not the book."
5,Love this movie!,"I really like this movie, it's a lot of fun! If you own at least the first one, you need to buy this one as well!"
3,Misleading,"I received this dvd fully sealed. My order definitely showed NEW. However, on the front label printed in the label it says RENTAL."
1,Hmmmmmmm,"This movie STUNK! It seemed to just ""lay"" there till the very end.... Only the last 5 minutes was mildly exciting! Hopefully there is not a F D 6."
3,Final Destination dvd order .,My DVD said it came with digital copy . It did not . I wrote company asking why I did not get my digital copy and as of yet have not heard from company ....Ralph B
2,seen one you seen them all,"I think the first one was the best...then it was sort of rolling down hill from there, just a lot of gore and that is about it. Fine for some folks I am sure, just not my liking."
4,Final Destination 5 Blu-ray 3D,"Ah, wasn't FD4 the Final? Not in Hollywood, Baby! Death comes full circle for 5 back to where it all began a decade ago on Flight 108. These not so lucky 8 survivors of a bridge collapse. Find that you can't cheat deaths list or can you? From start to ending 5 doesn't disappoint on the 3D screen with shocking realism!Must own for any Blu-ray 3D Fan."
4,JamieLynne,"Probably one of my favorites of the series, besides the first one. Good acting, good death scenes, good shock value. I did a more thorough review on youtube at : [...]"
5,Stay away from sharp objects,"I have the entire series thus far; I would definitely be open to purchasing any others they'd care to produce.The big question is............why? Why do I love this series? You have to admit it's a bleak formula that they follow with strict accordance in each film. Only the deaths of each new cast changes. They're like slasher flicks with an invisible slasher at work rigging up these bizarre Rube Goldberg traps. That's the part I like best, watching how one set of actions leads to something else that in turn causes something else to happen........and........Kapow! There's a certain amount of macabre wit at work here, I like that too.Advice to the filmmakers, don't stop now and work faster, 3 years between films shows a bit of laxness on your part."
5,"If you only own one cookbook, it should be this one.","Here is an introductory textbook on cooking. By introductory I mean it is complete, covering all the basics from gutting fish to French toast. While intended for the student enrolled in a professional culinary program, or as a reference for the working chef, it is useful for the serious amateur too.To get the most from this book, you have to be prepared to embrace a technique, rather than ingredent, based approach to preparing dishes. For example, the fish recipes are not collected under seafood. Instead you'll find them spread out between sections on grilling, poaching and baking following a detailed introduction to each cooking method. If that, or the fact that the recipes are usually scaled for 10 servings or more, bothers you, then this book isn't for you.This is a beautiful book full of useful, practical information to help you cook better. I adore it."
3,Not for the beginning chef!,Very technical. I am probably a better cook than the average person and have a hard time with this one sometimes. It's kind of like a cooking encyclopedia. Good for the academic chef. There are many good tips in it and plenty of recipes that will impress non-chefs (as long as you don't mess them up too much)A bit pricey though
4,Not for Conventional Thinkers,"In retrospect,this book reflects some of the internal conflict that the author was experiencing. Originally (in the mid 70s),it was the photography that caught my attention. Later, it was the chapter in which the author initiated a dialogue between Christ's humanity and divinity as He hung on the cross that held me spellbound. Religiously, if you are a conventional thinker, this book may distrub you. However, if you take it in small doses and really consider what is being said, your faith will be enriched."
5,New motorcycle again!,"I bought this pipe for my 2006 Yamaha Fz1 and... wow. Makes it sounds amazing, way more throaty. Just has a mean growl to it now and between this and my air intake definitely added pep to the bike. Doesn't feel like the bike is being choked anymore when I really get on the throttle. I had one issue and that was the noise reducer that came with it didn't fit into the pipe, but for me it wasn't an issue cause I really didn't have any plan of using it. Glad i went with the carbon fiber pipe looks 1000% better then the stock pipe that was on it. Also a side note, a friend of mine has a 650 Kawasaki ninja and he had similar results to myself with a very similar Yoshimura Slip-on pipe."
4,Ferdinand Who??,"I bought this album on a whim. I am always looking for different music for my ensemble to perform and this looked interesting. I couldn't take it out of my CD. The Piano Quintet is simply wonderful. The Octet is better than the Schubert Octet (same instrumentation). The Brahms influences were obvious, and while the music may be somewhat old fashioned (in the same manner Brahms is old fashioned), it is worth listening to.Buy this album for the music, not the performers. They do a very good job, but as is appropriate, you come away thinking about the music, not about the people who played it."
4,Excellent resource for crossbow builders,"This book is an interesting look at crossbows and siege engines, with lots of useful info for the DIY armourer. It's weakness is that it's written at the beginning of the century, and a little dated, both in writing style and content. I.e. modern materials are quite naturally not covered. It's strong points are the excellent drawings and illustrations. Highly recomennded overall."
5,excellant cd,"It came as expected. I am very happy with the price for the cd, it's very difficult to find this type of genre in the stores and not pay over 15.00 for them."
3,Not compatible with Samsung,"I bought these for the Samsung HT-C5500 home theater system - these mounts are not at all compatible. Didn't realize this until I opened the package, so I can't return them. Hopefully I can sell them on Ebay. If you have a compatible speaker system, these appear to be great quality and should do the trick. Just be sure they'll work with your speakers. Your speakers must have places on the back for screws - if not, they won't work."
3,Great deal and service.,"Good price, service and very fast shipping. Not really happy with this product cause it states that it can handle up to 8 lbs and in reality, it can't. I have 7 lb speakers that have stressed them to the point of almost failure (when mounting on the wall). After changing the mounting position from the side wall to the ceiling they are handling it much better. These mounts are only good for small speakers (like Bose) when wall mounting. If you are going to use them for heavy (capacity maxed) speakers, you should hang them from the ceiling."
3,"Look great, but difficult to install!",These mounts are great but they come with so many extra parts because they are universal that it took a while to figure out which piece went to my actual speakers. I would say it took a good 1.5-2 hours to install.
4,Great collection of stories commented by the author,"Some stories featured show a very strong writting fiber in Mr. silverberg, some are really among the best short science fiction stories I have read, the author also shares briefly his view on each story"
3,Just Okay,"For the money ,the Argus DC 1500 is okay. Keep in mind it doesn't have a flash or a window to preview the pictures. It takes 20 high res shots and 80 low res. I haven't even tried the low res because the high res isn't that great. If you're looking for a digital camera for e-mail than this camera will serve that purpose. Just keep in mind that you get what you pay for. I did really like the software that came with the camera. The Arcsoft Fantasy Photo is alot of fun to play with..."
2,FOCUS IS NOT ACCURATE.,The focus is incorrect. Picture is always not what you see in the view finder.
1,Don't judge by looks,I bought this digital camera for about $$. I was so excited because it was the first webcam I've ever bought and what seemed as a good price. After a while I regretted buying it in the first place because it takes bad quality pictures in both indoors and out. Besides that I've been having many problems with it (when I try taking pictures it wont work).
3,Couldn't finish it!,"Sorry, I tried several times to read this book. I hunted for passages that might interest me. Unfortunately, all I found was [the author] blowing his own horn. But then fantasy and science is about all that interests me. I'm sure someone with a historical bent would find this tale exhilarating."
4,SHUFFLES ALONG WITH ATTITUDE,"Charlie is so relaxed, taking time to stop off to look for a drink. He seems to sleep walk through his life with caual ease, whilst carrying out such dark deeds.The irony is that he has a sentimental heart which ultimately leads to his own disaster.I enjoyed this book very much; it draws you into its sleazy heart with consumate skill: introducing a world of cheapness in every turn.People get killed but no one cares... least of all the reader, it's as if we have quickly learned that some lives are not worth anything. It's a lie of course but we believe it without realising that we too have been numbed by what we see.I recommend this as tale, full of irony and extremely well written."
3,Amusing first novel.,"""The Ice Harvest"" by Scott Phillips is an interesting first novel.It is light entertainment...a noirish dark mystery/comedy.Filled with irony, it is set on Christmas eve in Wichita in 1979. The major character is Charlie Arglist, a ill-fated lawyer for the owner of some local strip clubs.He has a big scam going, skimming off the top. But then, everyone is scamming everyone...and the need to eliminate some participants along the way seems only natural.Charlie gets in and out of many jams that night as he attempts to make his getaway. How he is rewarded at the conclusion is the ultimate irony.It is short, to the point and a snap to read. A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."
2,Good Instructive Video,I found this video to be VERY useful...all steps were shown at different angles and I was able to do the steps after several attempts....I recommend this video to anyone that wants to learn two-step...
3,Databank calculator watch,"I bought this as a gift for a techie 18 year old. It is ok, but more a gadget than a nice watch."
4,The Watch That Slaps Women,"When I bought my last watch, the crystal was promptly scratched, and that was sad. But with this thing, I don't need to worry about it, because it's so cheap. All rubber and plastic. And you know you've got a Casio when the date function moves forward just like the clock. The cheesery of this devise absolutely blows my mind in the best way possible. It also made my arms incredibly buff."
2,Beware - No Backlight!!,"I've enjoyed Casio calculator-watches for many years. This one looks and feels cheaper than its predecessors. Most importantly, it lacks a back-light rendering useless in low-light."
3,Awesome watch!,This is an awesome watch! Feel like I am a kid again. Only thing is there is no backlight but other than that it is awesome!Fast shipping too!
3,it works just fine,"I bought this for my husband to replace an old calculator watch he had in high school--yes, he still likes them. He thought it was great and I thought it was a good price for the watch. So far, it works just fine."
3,"Review of Casio CA53W-1 ""Databank"" digital watch","This watch is of the usual Casio high standard but I was disappointed to find that it was not a true Databank Casio watch. The Casio Databank watch I had until I lost it recently had the cabability to store all manner of data.. including up to 100 names and addresses and phone numbers... This watch I received from Amazon is just a standard digital watch with an inbuilt calculator.. So I don't consider it to be a true ""Databank"".... GP"
2,I will watch this movie when I am out of the country.,"I like Passolini films, and have seen Canterbury Tales and The Decameron and enjoyed them. This film has a format which does not work in Canada."
1,Extremely disappointing....,"I did not find the film luminous, the scenery stunning, or the acting even entertaining. And, by the way, where were the 101 tales? All in all, neither the acting, nor the scenery or plot were enough to engage my attention beyond the first few minutes of unhappy disgust at the money I spent to purchase the DVD."
5,"Engaging, compelling, deeply moving and rewarding novel.","A beautiful Chinese girl disguises herself as a man and lives under one roof with a young male scholar for three years without revealing her true identity. They become ""sworn brothers"", soul mates and lovers in a world in which marriage is determined by social status and arranged by parents. Butterfly Lovers is based upon a popular Chinese folktale and is an engaging, compelling, deeply moving, highly recommended and rewarding novel."
5,"action packed, entertaining and informative possibilities of UFO & paranomal activity",I am a long time serious X-file fan. All the shows are throughly enjoyed for content and possibilities of ufo and paranormal activity
1,Disappointing,"I am a huge Gena Showalter fan. I love her LOTU series and her Atlantis series and have read some of her stand alone books such as Animal Instincts (I think that was the name of it but not sure). I am sad to say I was very disappointed in this book. I felt the characters lacked...well...character. Normally Gena's characters are full of life, sarcasm, wit and are likeable. These characters were not. They both fell flat for me and I found Julia Anderson to be annoying and didn't know why Tristan would like her at all. I also didn't find Tristan to have the humor or wit that Gena's warriors normally have. I got about 75 pages into the book and stopped reading. It just didn't hold my attention at all. I hate to write a bad review, especially on one of Gena's books since I really love almost all her series. I highly recomment the Lords of The Underworld and the Atlantis series. Love them!!!"
5,Loved this book,This was the second book I have read from Ms. Showalter. I was very pleased with the entire story line and her characters are wonderful. This book made me laugh and was almost impossible to put down until finished. I will be looking forward to more of her wonderful writing style in her books.
2,Still Looking for Pleasure,"Gena Showalter makes a valient attempt at creating a fantasy that is rich and full of lively characters. Unfortunately, the pleasure slave theme has already been used by an expert in Fantasy Lover and Showalter's attempt is paltry at best. The main character is so unbelievably pathetic. She does nothing but question herself throughout the entire book. She has no depth of character and is so annoying. Tristan, the hero, is also unbelievable, even for a fantasy. The pacing of the book is slow. I can ususally read a book in one sitting-it took me almost a week to wade through the Pleasure Slave.If you want really want a good read on pleasure slaves--check out Sherilyn Kenyon's Fantasy Lover."
2,"""Complete"" is a misleading modifier","My favorite segment of Top Gear is ""The News"" so I was disappointed to buy a DVD set that refers to itself as ""complete"" and then discover that ""The News"" was cut out of most of the episodes. There are other cuts as well, including a couple of the ""Star in a Reasonably Priced Car"" segments. The DVDs are still entertaining, but I have to give them a low rating for not CLEARLY stating which parts were missing. The disclaimer on the back of the case is infinitesimal and unhelpful."
3,"It's not what the last album was, but still...","Not as many straight-edge rockers as ""Winger"", and a little keyboard-heavy, but still a good effort. Of note: the Gulf War anthem ""Miles Away"". At least there's no Purple Haze cover this time around."
4,Gardening,The 1st-time gardening FL family members I got this book for found it very helpful within the first couple of pages.
4,Good Book,This book has lots of things in it. I think it will help to know month by month what to do. I purchased this book because we will be moving to Florida and I want all the knowledge I can get.
3,Surf section is highly misleading,"This review focuses on the section that drew me toward the book, the surf section (page 151). The author seems to have conducted some research about the names of some breaks but completely overestimated surf heights. For example La Marginal in Arecibo never, EVER reaches 25 feet. And if Los Tubos could reach 25 feet, then I'm 23 feet tall (8 foot maximum surf height seems more appropriate). In fact only a handful of breaks around the island legitimately reach 15ft plus. Make no mistake, surfing around the island can be a bit treacherous, specially for the inexperienced, but the book exaggerates maximum heights two fold sometimes maximum heights are even 3 times smaller than reported here. Just thought I'd mention this for the sake of accuracy. For more accurate descriptions on surf breaks in Puerto Rico, you might want to do some research online (many options)."
3,"Good, with practice","It is a difficult subject, surely not learned in a day! With practice, time and determination, the book is a really good one for learning plant families, not for the beginner or someone that wants to ID plants in the field. More of a text book."
5,"great wipes, great size!","These wipes are easy to get at, even in a hurry, and a wonderful size so that I don't need to worry about any oops. I have been very pleased with them."
2,deceiving picture,"You get what you pay for. It does work and it is technically a flatscreen but it is NOT a ""thin"" flat screen. I was looking to increase the space around my desk and the price was cheap but I would've certainly shelled more money out for a ""real"" flatscreen monitor. That was what I wanted in the first place. The picture of this item is deceiving and gave the illusion of a flatscreen but in reality, it is very bulky and weighs 40lbs."
2,Tell me Why?,"After reading all the raves, I bought this book. What a disappointment! First, none of the characters had depth, personality or held my interest with the exception of the stories surrounding Fraser and Kerslake. The plot was thin, or maybe I am just not interested in the innerworkings of British Parliament. However, I read it all, turning each page, waiting for something to happen. Someone tell me what I am missing here."
1,Was it all worth it???,"466 pages with the most predictable ending any decent reader can think of. I had to read it for Uni, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted the money. I would suggest Mr. Archer to spend less time designing his covers and give the stuff inside some place in his head. I'm serious."
1,Boring,This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read and that's saying quite a lot since I average 3 books a week. Maybe if you are a Brit the machinations of the House of Commons would be riveting but I doubt it.
3,does not fit for the thomas the train bed.,"I purchase the mattress which was recommended for me to purchase with my thomas the train bed. unfortunately it does not fit the width is two small. The matress sinks to the floor. I trusted the recommendations and that is the result I got, not satisfied at all, especiallly the delivery charges. I only give it a rating of 3 because the bed is soft and can work for a standard crib bed."
2,"Works, but not for very long","We have this fan in an incubator in the lab. It broke down after a few years, we replaced it with the same one, which lasted for another couple of years, then broke down again. Not very impressed. This fan breaks down too soon, and is very expensive for a fan lacking ball bearings. Now we got the Cooltron fan with double ball bearing for less than a third of the price. Let's see how this one holds up."
4,Perfect for the price,"I use these every day and don't expect them to last forever at $10, but they last about 6 months a pair, are totally comfortable, and offer pretty stellar sound quality for earbud-type headphones. Unless I one day discover substantially longer-lived earbuds for this kind of price, I'll keep re-ordering them."
2,Ahi Ahi Ahi my poor ears,"The sound is great but i don't suggest them if yourear's concha is small (like mine), it could hurt y...."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"I have never written a review before but this product was so terrible i felt that i had to spare the rest of the world from pruchasing such an appaling product. I bought these earphones with the intent to use with my ipod as i ran. However to my dismay they would not fit! Even when i was sitting they would fall off with every movment of my head no matter how sublte. Trust me, these ear bods are not worth your money"
1,Complete Crap. Incredibly horrible in every way. Lasted not even 1 day.,"I got them, i thought they look alright, they sounded decent and they weren't uncomfortable. so i was planning on typing a 5 star review for them. HOWEVER, less than 12 hours after buying them they started shorting out, one ear stopped working with minutes of that and then they completely stopped working. Please don't be fooled by the good reviews, these things will stop working when they're made this cheap."
2,Comentario,"El sonido no es muy bueno.Cuando tienes con él puesto unosminutos comienza a doler el oido. Por otrolado el agarre al espacio exterior de la orejaes perfecto, y no molesta a lo interno. Solo molestaen el canal auditivo."
3,"Work great, unless you have small ears....","These work great unless you have small ears. I had to give them to my husband and am still in search of something that will fit these small ears, as earbuds wont stay in my ears =("
4,A Surprising Find,"I used to burn through headphones all the time with my ipod. I got a pair of the black ones last fall and am still using them. This is simply a great headphone for the cost. Excellent range of volume. Stays is my ear for the most part when I'm out jogging or biking. For ten dollars, probably less, I have no regrets or second guesses about this product. The reason I am buying a new one is that the plastic covering near the splitter is off, now exposing the wires. Then again, this has after the countless times of tossing them in a packback, pocket, wrapped around the ipod.Again, for the cost, this is the best headphones that you can find."
1,"Fine for at first, then painful",These are painful to wear for any extended peroid of time. I have average sized ears and they start to really hurt after about half an hour or so.
3,Quite a good book,"This is quite a good book. It centers round the question of why the EU refused to mention the 'Christian heritage' of 'Europe' in their new constitution. The author argues that it should have been mentioned. It argues that 'Europe' will fail as a democracy unless it recovers its Christian heritage. A flaw in the book is that it takes the existence of 'Europe' for granted. But there is no such thing. 'Europe' doesn't have a Christian heritage, and neither do 'Europeans' - so it is not surprising they are amnesiac about it. France has a Christian heritage, and so does Poland, Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, Slovakia, Spain, Italy, etc. Even today, probably a small majority of people in most of the countries would say, 'Ireland has a Christian heritage', 'Germany has a Christian heritage'. The Irish, Germans, Italians, etc, could hardly deny it, if they reflect on the history of their own countries. But 'Europe'? What Christian heritage could this non-country have?"
2,Just a rehash,"Weigel spends most of his time sifting through others work most notably J.H.H. Weiler and trying to defend the RCC's social gosel. While he correctly sifts the ""europe problem"" as a lack of faith in God, he tries to fill the void of a faithless europe by substituting John Paul 2 and the gospel of works instead of the life changing gospel of Jesus. His solution doesn't resolve the problem of faithlessness.He mentions that Europe is without hope, yet he doesn't connect that only Jesus Christ is "" The Christ in you, the hope of glory""He seemed to have written this book by condensing others works along the lines of an undergraduates term paper in college.Very little , if any, original thought."
5,Nice one,"This album is undoubtedly one of the best albums in my CD collection at the moment. I never really heard of them before accidentally picking up this album for cheap in a junk store and its been in my stereo ever sinse. They have a unique sound combining the heavy rock atmospheric AOR style of Giant, with the almost bluesy feel of poison. The guys voice is amazing and the guitar work is fairly innovative adding particular diversity to each song. This is a well produced 80's hard rock album filled with some very good ballards. Worth buying"
4,more exposure,"These guys need more exposure,would be great if the radio played thisstuff.If you want to hear this you have to get satellite radio,at leastwe have that.The radio plays crap like green day,goo goo dolls and the foofighters since when are they hard rock?.Hail to 80's and amazon forintoducing rock like this.If you like real good rock this is great foryour collection."
3,Beggars & Thieves Overlooked Solid First Release,"One of the many cut out bin bands that came out of the Atlantic Records mill in the early 90's, Beggars and Thieves went on to record two more full length LP's and is now considering doing another to be release in 2010. For fans of Kiss Of The Gypsy, Electric Boys, Drivin-N-Cryin, The Graveyard Train, Cinderella and Baton Rouge this is a perfect release to add to the collection.Currently former members are residing in Las Vegas and are part of the Sin City Sinners band."
5,demon hunting is fun!,"Ok, the name kinda sez it all. If you want a fun, sexy, stylish movie thats an enjoyable distraction for a few hours you will like it!"
3,opening scene and title credits,worth buying for the opening scene and the opening credits are pretty cool with that song playing. plus there's a couple good fight sequences in it. for a million dolar budget which 900k probably went to Sean Patrick it was ok.
1,An abomination of cinematography,I only watched it because it was late and there was nothing else on. It's very bad movie. I'm disappointed that Sean Patrick would go from Boondock Saint [ AMAZING ] to demon hunter in a crappy film. Sad day.
3,A nice ring,"Great packaging, and arrived very fast. As for the quality of the product it is very shiny and clean, but the only one thing that I didn't like was that the small grooves by the heart had some thing black in it, and that just marred the clean looked. But over all the design is pretty."
5,wonderful ring,"This ring is so nice. Always trying to find a claddagh ring i like, its perfect for me. I was worried it would look too tiny by some reviews left, but its really a nice size. Nice proportions between crown, heart & trinity symbols. For the price of this, im glad i bought."
5,Karen of NY,This ring is gorgeous! It is solid and beautifully crafted. Should you be a half size go up one size. The ring came in an adorable gift box with bow. This ring is truly special and I love it.
1,Silver Plated,"Shortly after this ring was purchased my girlfriend could not wear it because it is only silver plated.Please be aware of this fact. The coating will wear off, and in some cases will cause an allergic reaction.Purchase jewelry with care when buying online, and contact the company before you purchase their product."
4,Great Ring!!!,"This ring is a beautiful piece, I bought it for my sister and I think she will love it. The box that it comes in is adorable!! It is perfect without wrapping it yourself!"
1,NOT REAL STERLING! - NO STAMP! GREEN FINGER! A FAKE!,"I just recieved this ring from my boyfriend as a birthday gift. After one day of wearing, I'm having an allergic reaction - as the ring is NOT sterling silver. Upon closer inspection there is no 925 stamp on the ring as the as suggests. This is a fake. Do not purchase it if you have sensitive skin and can only wear sterling, gold, or platinum. HUGE disappointment."
5,wonderful,I bought this for a pinkie ring and it looks and feels great. I get many compliments on it. It is dainty and feminine. I have worn it continuously for several weeks and NO problem with green finger at all. I believe it is a quality item both in workmanship and in sterling silver content.
3,Disappointed,Was stoked when I got it and then by the second day it turned my finger green because it's not real very disappointed!
5,ballistic/fists of justice,"I wanted to say that this is one of the most under-rated films in the action genre to come out,,I had it on laser disc and I loved it.I have looked for the dvd for years.Jones is a good villain,Beeson a great fighter and so good to see Richard-Shaft-Roundtree in action,,,and Marjean Holden is great as the heroine and quite beautiful to boot,,,come on release this on dvd or better yet blu ray.."
1,not really a handbook,"I got this book because of the wide array of religions covered but I didn't realize how biased the author was in describing the other religions. Instead of giving out just the facts, the author states his own opinion about the religion in relation to his own Christian background. For instance, he claims that certain Old Testament chapters are dated incorrectly too late and that is why Zoroastrianism could not have influenced the Bible but he doesn't say HIS PROOF for how it was incorrectly dated. If you're interested in a book that gives a neutral account of world religions, this IS NOT the book for you."
5,It's a great CD,"One of the best lullaby CDs ever! B-man says it's insipid but it's made to put baby's to sleep. It's soothing. It's not made to be entertaining. And yes, it is real Hawaiian music! I buy it every time for baby showers and everyone has loved it."
2,... horror,"The only reason I bought this movie is because Steve Railsback is in it. This is a typical T & A film which I suspect appealed most to those who want to see Pamela Anderson naked. The only acting in the whole thing occurs when Railsback is on camera; his portrayal of the evil and sadistic police chief is over the top, as only he can do it - he sends chills down your spine - but I love it! Call me sick. The story line is weak and contrived."
1,"Why would anyone see this movie? Hmmmm, I wonder...?","Due to group preasure I did see it.The movie was somewhat funny. I mean; bad acting, stupid story, everything realy sucked. That is the one point for seeing the film though (well, that and Pamela Anderson... but why not rent a porn movie if that is what you want). If you possess a sence of irony the movie can be rather funny. But had it been anything like Plan 9 I could have given it better rating for just being geniously bad. This film is not even that!"
3,Yes!,"Unless youre a eunich, you cant help but get turned on by Barb. You will rarely see a movie actress in leather outfits like these, and riding a motorcycle to boot. Personally i dont feel the plot is as bad as reviewed here. It's campy sci-fi with enough action to keep you entertained."
3,Three stars,"It's better than Anna Nicole Smith's ""Skyscraper"" movie. It's better than Jean Claude Van-Damme's ""The Quest"" movie."
2,BARB WIRE review,"There are some movies that really don't need a good plot. Such as any film starring a leather-clad Pam Anderson with her breasts nearly popping out in almost every shot. Pam looks great in a really dumb movie that is actually inspired by Casablanca (I'm not kidding!).Pamela Anderson is a leather-clad babe (but don't call her that) who is fighting crime in 2017 as a female soldier who also runs a nightclub. Anderson's superb cleavage (which pops out at every corner) is the real star of this silly live action comic book. Running around in leather bondage-type numbers with really big guns makes for some easy on the eyes entertainment. Her acting is awful but if you are in for that, you get what you deserve. As far as movies for horny young males to entertain themselves to, they don't get much better, but as a serious action film, this one is pure garbage. Anderson as a tough superhero chick is about as easy to believe as Marlon Brando as a sex object."
1,doesn't really do the job,"The product is cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I found that there was alot of stuff i didn't use or needed. I rather buy the lamp separate for better quality."
4,"Solid, but DP 36 is better",There are several releases now from 9/72 all are good...DP 36 is the best easily though
2,Not as good as Season 1,"It's ok, but it hasn't grabbed my attention like Season 1 of Deadliest Roads did. I liked how you learned more about their interactions with the local areas in Season 1. This one so far seems to be more of just in the trucks and not learning as much about the area they are in. It loses something by just having the truckers in it and not having the local spotters like in season one. The reactions of the local people and interactions are what make the show to me. Otherwise it's just driving on dangerous roads over and over and over and listening to them complain. Hopefully future episodes are more like Season 1 !!!!"
4,Loved it with qualifications,"TC Boyle is such a good writer and story-teller, and this particular story and its attendant characters are so fascinating, that I found I couldn't put the book down. The prose is, for the most part, energetic, riveting, lush, evocative -- everything I've come to expect from Boyle. But I do agree with reviewer A. Maxham that Boyle hasn't dug quite deep enough into the character of Katherine to make us understand how such an obviously intelligent woman could have married the lunatic Stanley. I think he comes close -- love is a strange thing, and people fall in love despite obvious red flags all the time -- but in this case I had trouble believing that, when all was said and done, Katherine would go ahead and marry Stanley anyway. So it took a little more concerted effort to suspend my disbelief concerning that aspect of the book (and it's a central aspect). Still, I was willing to make the effort bec. I was enjoying the book so much, and I was sorry when the story ended."
2,Not the Best,Even with a love for the areas that he writes about in Riven Rock and an appreciation for how he threw in local references - this book sadly lacked a central plot. I was dissappointed that the book took several turns that led to nowhere significant with both Eddie and Mr. McCormick. Having loved previous books by T.C. Boyle - this one left me feeling like I had wasted a day of reading.
1,Never got it!,Was suppose to get to me by Christmas. Said it was shipped out on the 14th and here it is the 28th and still nothing. This company is a joke. Do not order from them.
5,Got this CD autographed by the band,"This is for the hardcore Zebra fans. If you ever seen them live, this CD will bring back some great memories. My CD was signed at The Grant Street Dance Hall in Lafayette LA. What a great night. I was searching around on UTUBE for zebra videos and one came up of Randy Jackson doing a solo cover of While my guitar weeps. It was awsome."
1,......WAY TOO MUCH!,"Judging from the cover and the description on the back of this DVD, you might guess it contains examples of several styles of Martial Arts, with David Carradine hosting, interviewing, and narrating. But you'd be wrong.The clever ones guessed this is a 30-minute episode of some early 80's teen talk show, in which Carradine speaks maybe 10 sentences (and one of those sentences is used up plugging the upcoming ""Americana;"" his bare foot do get a lot of camera time, though), the teen hosts sloppily don white belts and ask martial arts instructors a few basic questions, and, of course, there's the video of Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" and a few clips from the bottom of the poorly-dubbed-kung-fu-theater barrel.Silly me. I was one of the dope's who guessed the first scenario. Sheesh, it's all so obvious now..."
2,Hard to use functions,Initial set up was hard to use even though the buttons worked. Directions mis-leading and could never get watch to read 24 hr time in the digital time. Also the light portion was poor and could not read the digital section.
1,Too cheap...,The idea was to get an inexpensive watch for use it on all those times where you don't want to ruin the pricey watch. Well... this Casio is TOO CHEAP! I don't recommend it at all. Spend U$S 10 more and get something better.
1,Casio Men's Forester Ana-Digi Sports Thermometer 10-Year Battery Watch #AW80-1AV,"This is not a Thermometer but a telememo, very disapponted!Telememo is some useless function to store 3 character memos with numbers."
3,Not what I expected,"This watch has great features but the one drawback is its domed face. Within a few days the face was all scratched. Most watches have a ""sunken"" face that is protected by the rim. This one does not. Very disappointed."
2,Really small face,"This wrist watch has an unusually small face. So small, it is annoying to look at. Go for something else if you need a wristwatch that fits nicely on the wrist."
4,Good Watch,Good value for the money. I was looking for an everyday watch with day/date functions. This fills the bill. It's lightweight and the ten year battery was a selling point. Only thing it lacks is a second hand.
3,Just good enough,"I purchase this watch because I thought it would be classic and appropriate for different occasions. Well, this watch is just good enough, it offers different options such as stop watch which I need for my workouts. It also offers world time and daylight saving automated programmation. The problem is the screen of the watch. Before I knew it I could see scratches on the screen. It really got to me, then I realized that it's plastic. I guess that's what I get for the money I spent. Overall, it's good enough for the money spent."
4,Swiss army knife of a watch,"Good point - watch has a light. Overkill - watch stores phone numbers, has 3 alarms (2 is more than enough). Keeps time in various world cities. Set analog time with button combinations. Watch has too much and god help you if you lose the owner's manual. Oh did I tell you there is a Daylight Savings Time mode that I also couldn't figure out. So the price is great and you get more than you'll need or probably ever use."
3,Stop working after 6 months,"The watch stops working after 6 months. It says 10 years battery life. Not sure whether the battery ran out or something else went wrong. I had another analog-digital casio previously and that lasted about 5 years. This one seems to be a lemon.There is no regular nob to change the time. So whenever i like to adjust analog time when the time zone changes, I had to read the manual to do it. That is not convenient.Edit:After i opened up the case and tried to take out the battery, it became working again. will update this if it breaks again."
4,Good target workout,"Work those abs in a different way than ever before! This workout works! If done consistently it's as good as doing a bizillion crunches but definitely more fun. I use this in combination with another, such as a half hour to 40 min cardio workout in addition to one 15 min segment of this workout. If you haven't had any dance training or aren't familiar with bellydance, this isn't for you (why I took one star off). I say this mainly because you could easily injure yourself doing the undulations if you aren't familiar with how to move your body in a correct way. I also love Suhaila's Jazz Fitness Fusion. This is a lot of fun and a great way to play around with belly dance if you haven't had any dance background. It's also a more complete workout."
2,living under the shadow,"Interesting to see what the descendant of Jean-Jacques is up to. Well, it's a shame really."
2,"improved my skills, but no drills.",I was sorely disappointed when I found that the drills promised in the product description had been left out of my order.
2,bad writing at its finest!!!,"To keep your interest and keep this short simply know that this book in my hand contains NO LEGAL ADVICE nor does it contain ANY INFORMATION ON HOW TO ESTABLISH A COMMON LAW TRUST. This book is simply the precursor to the authors' self-help book which runs (...)! Also this book contains NO LEGAL CODE!!!IRS of otherwise. The authors' obviously expect the reader to have a lot of faith in the truth of their deductions.It may be true that Thomas Jefferson and Ross H Perot have established common law trusts but they had their lawyers do all the work!!! The actual paperwork of the trust is simple but it is necessary to pay for advice on how to file correctly. ALso, you may want to have a ""professional"" overview and inspect your work to make sure the IRS will have no problems with you.Anyone reading this book should look for a book which contains encoded filing information...actual court cases and actual code always helps the reader understand and believe at the same time!!"
1,Constitutional Trusts are TAX FRAUD,"Constitutional Trusts/Pure Trusts are absolutely bogus. They are not legal trust entities and do not shelter income of any type. These trusts are tax scams that do not work. Please see IRS Notice 97-24; T.C. Memo 1994-303; T.C. Memo 1991-264.Contact any experienced tax attorney/CPA for the truth.Do not pay anyone to establish this type of ""non-trust."" If you believe that you can avoid income tax/reduce income tax by utilizing this type of vehicle, please reference the above mentioned Tax Court Memos. The IRS will prosecute. Don't believe this material."
4,One of the better Bollywood films,"NYC was used to great advantage in this film, as well as the talents of the three main actors. Shah Rukh Khan stands out, as usual. He is both funny and dramatic; overacting brilliantly, Khan shamelessly and effectively tugs at your heart strings. The only real problem I had with the film was the subplot involving the annoying grandmother's hatred for one of her grandchildren-it was over-the-top and unnecessary. The music is great overall, with the moving theme song perfectly encapsulating the mood of the movie. I would definitely recommend ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" to those who generally avoid Bollywood films-this one is definitely worth your time."
3,One of the best from Ratt,"""Can't wait on love"" is a truly great song and it is followed by my second favourite song-""giving ourself away"". I am not so fond of their singles ""loving you is a dirty job"" but still the whole thing is worth a listen. It is 99 and i am still thrashing all those late 80's hard rock tapes i need more!"
2,It could have been a really great read...,....if only it wasn't a story of why men hate women and why women hate men. The bones of the story could have provided for a very unique story line. I almost gave this one three starts because parts of it were really good.Then the author had to get on her soapbox about the battle between men and women and it fell apart. I ended up speed reading the last half of the book just to get it over with.
3,Good novels but decisions are all wrong,"After reading this many books from this seire, I have the real feeling that the main character made this far in life because of amazing luck and the constant protection of Shamron. The man is letting his heart dictate his decision and not his brain. That is one of the no no in that kind of world."
3,Names.......,"I had difficulty with the names of people and streets, etc. Maybe that was the reason I didn't feel the thrill. Will try another Daniel Silva."
3,mistake at the beginning,On page 4 author states that tenant appeared on the final Friday of March on the next page he states that he vanished in the middle of March. Neat trick.
1,same old blame game,Mr. Silva continues on with the overwitten saga of Isreal and Palestine.How one blames the other and how they go about the sad story of countless justifactions for murders of each other.I found the story slow a filled with a slanted bias towards one nation over the other.
2,head creep,"When you tighten the elevation screw, it pitches the head horizontally from level to non-level. That makes the horizon in your photos pitched... If you don't tighten the elevation screw, the head creeps forward and back.I cannot recommend this tripod to anyone and ended up here because I'm looking for a replacement tripod."
4,Velbon VideoMate-607,"I've owned a Velbon tripod before. Bought my first one in 1985 when I purchased my first Sony 8mm camcorder, and I've had it ever since! This one is of course more modern and lighter in weight. The handle for the head is nice and long, just what I was looking for. But, yes, here comes the but, I was disappointed in how much plastic is incorporated into the design. Because of the lighter weight, one sacrifices in sturdiness, and I know something I will need to remember when panning with my prosumer camera's mounted to the head. The quick release is an improvement, I like the larger size. Hey, didn't pay much, so couldn't expect too much, right?! Heavy-duty? No sir. Practical and worth the price? Yes."
1,"i never recieved it, it was sold before i got it",i cant review something that i didnt receive. someone bought it right before i ordered it.
2,NOT the best mattress,"I was really disappointed in this ""Sealy Ultra"". It does not feel like a very good mattress. We'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better. I'd say you need to see the mattress, decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet."
3,it's too soft for me.,"I knew that this matress was soft when I purchased it. First off it was bent and I can't get it perfectly flat. Our baby came early, so I didn't have time to exchange it or return it. Maybe I just wasn't expecting it to be so soft. From the review, I was expecting it to be firm, but with a little give. That's why I gave it only 3 stars. The price is nice, but I think next time, I'll go for something firmer."
2,"BLINK sure did not read in a blink--slow, slow read!","Skip BLINK.BLINK sure did not read in a blink--slow, slow read!To honor the crux of his book, I figured I should write the review so you would know within the first few seconds that you could skip reading this book.Liked the concept. Delivery was tediously slow. Lessons learned were minimal.However, I will give TIPPING POINTThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differencea shot based on strong recommendations from friends and colleagues."
4,Terrific storytelling...,"Gladwell is a superb, captivating storyteller. He opens the book with some compelling examples to support his principal objective of the book: the ""task of making sense of ourselves and our behavior requires that we can acknowledge there can be as much value in the blink of an eye as months of rational analysis."" He amply succeeds in accomplishing his objective yet you can't help being left wanting for how we can opportunistically leverage our instincts versus when we should sit back and take a deep breath and analyze. That being said, I enjoyed the book and found the topic to be important. And the book passes my ultimate screen of a subject well explored that I will remember for years to come."
2,amusing...,"I agree with mr. bookworm, this book doesn't contain any secrets or insight...and I'm still not sure of the point...but some of the studies are amusing...though taking a nap could possibly be more useful if you have some insightful dreams..."
3,Not my favorite,"Started out really liking it, but it suddenly started feeling suspiciously like a self-help book. I'm not crazy into that."
2,Interesting but not really awakening.,"The book is interesting but not too awakening. It makes you think about your subconscious and instincts when making decisions. If a book is really good, I find it hard to put down. That was not the case with this book."
2,"Major, MAJOR Disappointment; DRIFTS, BADLY!!","This book could probably be anywhere from a 1/3rd to a 1/4th as big as it is; if not a pamphlet. Maybe the 2d star I gave it is too altruistic. But I will credit it with a few good points.For what it purports to write about, it's WAY WAY too heavily larded down with minutiae and details to the point of the reader starting to doze off, break concentration from Gladwell's aggregate point, or both. Gladwell really needs to take a course on/in brevity.As much as I tried to give it a chance in spite of what the coverflap said of who the author's written for, I can understand why he writes for them and why they hired him.Definitely near the bottom of my list of recommends."
1,please,"I didn't finish blink, made it two-thirds of the way through. The whole premise is stupid to me, and the most bothersome part is that while the author tosses around buzz terms like thin slicing and this so-called built in ability to laser through the troublesome act of actually reflecting on a comprehensive picture, he never really touches on the fact that 9 out of 10 of his examples are the result of expert ability based on 20+ years of dedication to the respective discipline, or riding on the shoulders of the equally applied efforts of someone else. And what really bothers me is how many people flock to this *&% as this wonderful new way of thinking. I made it as far as I did because the anecdotes are entertaining, but c'mon gimme a break, and jeesh."
5,Ausgezeichnet!!,"One of the most facinating books I have ever read. If you want to know what people are really thinking, despite what they may be saying, read this awesome book."
3,A fall off from Tipping Point,"A talented writer can make any topic interesting and Gladwell is definitely that. However, in comparison to Tipping Point it pales in the revelatory value of the science. So, it is a good read but I expected more from this author."
2,noncohesive and contradictory,"Just a short note to mention that while some of the thoughts and stories in the book are pretty interesting, as a whole it is not cohesive and often self contradictory. It's written a bit like a first year term paper. . . all over the place with no direction. Skip it."
3,Very Informative but not Well Written,"You can learn some very interesting things about yourself and others by reading this book, however the author fails to make the material interesting. Somehow, Malcom manages to make boring a discussion that should be truly riveting."
1,Superficial pop sociology,"I found Blink to be superficial with no serious insights. Its basic premise is to trust your snap judgement but only if you have sufficient knowledge to do so. Its other points are to think outside the box and don't get bogged down in the minuteness of knowledge.Although easy to read and somewhat enjoyable there is nothing new here, so move along.I've also read Malcom Gladwell's ""Ouliers"" which I would rate higher because it did contain some new insights for me, but it was still basic pop sociology."
2,BLink and you'll fall asleep..,"Blink! what seemed like a fascinating subject pulled me in and then after 100 pages I put it down. Just like that, in a flash of a moment or a blink, I decided I can't finish this book. Might have made a fascinating magazine article in New Yorker magazine but like that magazine this book just started boring me. Blink."
3,Tipping Point is better,An interesting take on a phenomena already described a few years earlier by Gavin deBecker in 'Gift of Fear'. Not as good as the author's earlier work 'Tipping Point'.
2,Simplistic,"Malcolm Gladwell writes the book like the reporter that he is. All the relevant information is presented in the first few chapters : the rest of the book is pretty much a ""repeat and rehash"" of the original concept. Which by the way is not a novel one at all. Anyone who lives above the most superficial level knows that as humans we react to circumstances at many levels: intuitive, energetic, genetic, instinctive or even karmic. An okay book for cocktail conversation; very lightweight for anyone halfway intellectual...minal"
2,Quick read,Blink flies by too fast. It was to me like reading a series of newpaper articles. But very interesting nevertheless.
1,Aha? More like ha ha...,"A book filled with flabby logic and intellectual laziness. Very frustrating, as I concur with the underlying premise that we should recognize and employ our gut reactions. This is a popular journalist's version of a subject better handled by someone with more expertise."
2,BLINK -NOT A GOOD READ FOR ME ( I WISH I GET MY MONEY BACK),"I did not like this book because to me it felt like the author is providing unnecessary details to fill pages of a book.The underlying theory is well understood, but the narrative is too verbose."
2,Little better than a snoozer,"While this book has some fascinating sections (see the section on autism, as well as the opening chapter) mainly I found Mr. Gladwell's latest release to be boring overall. Some of his examples of 'thin slicing' were far fetched to say the least, and he did not explore the other possible reasons behind the failure of certain of his examples. Read it for a book club, and everyone else liked it to give the author credit... but I won't read any of his other books on my own. After the interesting first chapter I was expecting better, and was let down. And there was absolutely no reason to include every muscle twitch in the body language section."
3,"Interesting book, but....","""Blink"" is a very interesting book to read. Plenty of stories that really make you think about how people make decisions, even first impressions. The reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 5 is that though the book is interesting, after finishing it, I'm unsure of how to apply what I have read or even if there is any benefit to applying what I have read. The book's focus is on the bad and good decisions that people or companies have made in the blink of an eye. But, even as I write this, I'm still left with -- what did I really learn and can I apply it? It's still a good read but I wish I would have borrowed it from the library instead of buying it."
4,Futures created in an instant!,"A fantastic book, tells I like it is! Lives are guided by instant subconscious decisions, choices made - futures secured or lost in the flash of an eye. As a friend in military intelligence taught me ""success is about people's perception - which often is totally void of reality."" A brilliant book for any Corporate........I specialise in seeing at first glance this book encompasses a well rounded insight into the importance of these skills. TRUITY Williams from Wanabelong.com Australia."
3,One Either Likes Spumoni or One Doesn't,"This book appears to literal, rational, linear thinkers to be an experiment of disorganized pseudo-intellectual dissertation about rational and irrational thought by a master of the latter. Although I'm also one who isn't likely to stay inside the box, the direction I take when exiting the box is a different one. Therefore it didn't really hold my attention as I worked my way through it in a time-constricted world because I wanted to move on to something else. It's like ice cream flavors: one either likes spumoni or one doesn't."
3,Lots of Interesting Topics,"I am a big Malcolm Gladwell fan. He has a way of weaving very dry, scientific material into great stories in which you learn not only what he's intending to advocate, but also about miscellaneous, interesting topics. In short, you become a great guest at cocktail parties because you have fun topics to chat about with other people.He's tough to recommend, though, since the subject matter can be a bit dry and bog down at times. I am also sometimes challenged by the leaps he makes that A automatically equals, or leads to, B, without giving me more support for why. But, I still enjoyed the book (although enjoyed The Tipping Point a bit more). All in all, very interesting, though."
2,good at the beginning but boring after 2nd chapter....,"the book began with lots of interesting observations and new ideas, really eye catching so to speak but after a couple of chapters, it is the same thesis rehashed many times with different stories to illustrate the same concept(s). i thought the writer could have done a magazine feature article on this topic instead of writing a full length book. so, definitely borrow the book from the public library as you can finish the whole book in 2 hours. on content alone, this book does not deserve a ""buy"" but deserve a ""borrow""."
5,Book,"Awesome book!! Have read The Tipping Point and the Outliers by Malcolm McDowell as well and they are all excellent. He writes in a way that holds you from page one and reads like a fascinating novel. Blink is my favorite as it is amazing food for thought, insightful and makes you look at things in a whole different way. I've recommended this book to many people."
1,Duh....,"In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener."
3,Interesting enough,"Some very interesting case studies. Some very obvious (not so interesting) case studies. Decent writing. Overall, worth the read (or, as in my case, the listen-to). In the past, I have enjoyed Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker Magazine. Blink is like several NYM pieces strung together, not fully satisfying for the stringing, but entertaining enough, and occasionally thought-provoking."
3,Lightweight read for intellectuals,"A series of interesting anecdotes create an enjoyable, effort-free and disposable read. Gladwell shares other people's hard work and hard-won insights, but by the time it gets to us it's conversation-piece material.The stories themselves are interesting and well-told. The case of the ghastly series of errors of police officers and a man standing on his stoop was expecially compelling."
3,Blink,"I found the book somewhat boring and repetitive. There were parts, particular the police reactions, interestering but the first half seemed very repetitive."
3,Interesting but not much to take away,"The book is interesting to read but it doesn't offer much (or anything) in the way of ""lessons to be learned"". It discusses how some people have developed a good intuition and why that intuition is sometimes wrong - but offers nothing in the way of improving your intuition / decision making ability."
1,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,A big waste of time... he could have told the story in about 5 pages...
2,BLINK!! Blank. blunk.,"Gladwell deftly squeezes about 100 pages of content into almost 300 pages of book. It goes from pretty good to tedious to boring. He draws conclusions which are not based on any ""facts"" in the book, but he states his ideas as if they were absolute truths. I gave him 2 stars because the first part of the book was OK.Don't waste your time and your money."
1,Neither Power nor Thinking,Just a long list of antedotes. Interesting for the first two seconds at best. Not useful reading.
1,Failure,Summary:If you are an expert then trust your gut feelings.If you are not an expert then don't trust your gut feelings.
3,Just OK,Starts out fairly interesting with thin-slicing theme. Ends up just a bunch of regurgitated b.s.
1,Junk Science,"This Book is worth nothing, not even the paper it is printed on.The book is totally self-contradictory and the book contains useless facts and is much too verbose. A waste of time and money."
4,A must read...,"I think this is a must read, especially for those that enjoy psychology and understanding human behavior, human interaction and the reason we do many of the things the way we do. I think it is also a great self improvement tool.This book really makes you think. I loved the different examples that are provided from situations in the lives of people, from various walks of life, ranging from an Army commander to a food taster!The author does a great job of evaluating all sides of the topic and provides frequent reference to earlier instances.Overall, a very nice read, that I hope to keep doing time and again"
1,Misleading and disappointing,"The main reason I bought this book was because of the promise of teaching you how to improve upon utilizing your gut instinct. As I progressed through the book, my gut instict was telling me that wasn't going to happen, and it was right. It was just a series of studies and examples of where instinct has worked and where it hasn't. I didn't read one paragraph where the author instructs on how to improve upon or develop your unconscious decision-making. The stories are interesting but the book was a big disappointment to me."
3,"Blink, and any substantial content is gone!","There are some interesting narratives in the book- strung together with useless chatter and fill. (Too much about Kenna and Coke, for example.) I think Gladwell had enough real content to make an excellent magazine article and spent some time creating enough filler to turn it into a book."
1,Fantastic...................................................,Oh boy! This book is fantastic! There are so many good advices for me and you!'You can easily with the red score! This is one of the best books in the world!Hups... sorry.. I was just kidding :)
3,"good, but didn't agree with some of the info","This book was an interesting read until I reached the chapter ""Seven seconds in the bronx"" I disagree that police officers should be taught to look at a persons face when most officers are killed by the HANDS of another person. I agree that a lot can be learned by evaluating a person's facial expressions; however, I am always skeptical about persons who second guess anothers actions. I had an appreciation for the book as a whole. I would never encourage a police officer to focus on an offenders facial expression, PERIOD! Take a ride in a patrol car and see what body part you focus on."
4,"Not what I expected, but not bad","When I bought this book, I thought it would have exercizes to increase one's ability to think quickly. This book does not do that, but instead gives you a look into some of the amazing things your brain does in an instant. An interesting read if you want to learn a little about how we are able to make decisions in an instant."
4,Good airplane reading,I enjoyed the book. If you liked Tipping Point you should like this one. I experienced a humourous moment when a (consulting)client was giving me grief for not being able to make a decision quickly enough. I realised I was halfway through the book and perhaps needed to 'take a leaf out of it'.
5,Blink,"Classic Malcolm Gladwell which is always fascinating. A look at judgment, and when we should trust our instincts over our more considered thinking and when we should not."
3,"Repetitive, but thought provoking","Repetitive, but thought provoking. The author tends to make the sames points using other's research. Fairly basic premise with some opposing points of view as well. Worth a read if you're bored. Otherwise, just read the overview and save the time and money."
3,The Power & The Danger Of Snap Decisions,"""Blink"" reads more like a review of studies of the consequences of making snap decisions. Guess what? Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're not. How enlightening.Nevertheless, the experiments that are discussed are fascinating, and will give you insight into when to trust your intuition."
2,"Quick, initially interesting but then seems to lose focus","Substantively not as good as ""The Tipping Point"", but delivered with the same easy prose. Especially in the beginning, there are some interesting recounts of real life situations. Throughout the book the author draws some conclusions that are tenuous at best and thus the book is probably better if read with a critical eye. The number of copies sold may be misleading in regards to the real world, business knowledge that can be drawn from the book. All in all, I recommend this book as simple, leisure read that should be approached critically."
2,blink tank,"If you consider yourself an intellectual (you know who you are...Matrix is your favorite movie) you will appreciate reading this book. Thereafter, you will commit the anecdotal experiments to memory and will shamelessly flaunt them at wine tastings.The author introduces the concept of thin-slicing beyond the delicatessen. He also informs the reader that snap judgments are not merely relegated to NFL quarterbacks."
1,A Major Disappointment with Unsightly Errors,"Well, I rushed out to buy Blink and after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this book was not worth the money. The Tipping Point was an interesting book, but in this boring and silly volume the author tries to analyze all sorts of topics without the credentials to do so. The reader is left with information that seems upsupported and in some cases outdated. Moreover, the book needs a good editor. Even some of the basics of English have been overlooked. For example, the author mixes a singular object with a plural subject in this sentence, ""we need the ability to know our own mind."" There are a number of examples of this throughout the book and it made me think that the author and the editor rushed to get this book published. What a disservice to readers and what a shame. You know one would think if the author is so good at examining the mind, he would be as good at catching first-grade grammatical errors."
3,INTERESTING BUT NOT ESSENTIAL,"Mr. Gladwell is very talented. He certainly did his homework on this one. At the end of the book though I was left wondering, ""Okay...so what is the conclusion?"" The book came to a rather abrupt ending and I couldn't tell if the author was for or against snap judgments.My biggest disappointment is that there was no warning regarding explicit language. I was listening to this work on CD with my young daughters in the car when all of a sudden he starts using profane words in an effort to quote others. Was it necessary to include such language?"
2,Borrow this from the library,There are a few interesting stories -- loved the food tasters-- but there is also a lot of verbage to slog through to get to them.The author's interview with Charlie Rose is what got me interested in reading the book. Mr. Gladwell is a better talker than writer.I am very grateful to have gotten this book out of the library instead of buying it.
1,"I should have followed my ""blink"" thought","1. The only reason I gave this a one star is that the material in this book (which is interesting) could have been markedly condensed. My ""blink"" thought prior to reading this book was, ""this is going to be a lame book... I'm going to be wasting my time on common sense stuff"" and as this book describes throughout the too many pages, I was right.2. Thus, unless you want to waste your time reading redundant and somewhat boring material, just read some summary reviews, get the gist of the book and live life."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I am giving this book four stars for bringing together so many interesting studies and facts into one book. As a hypnotherapist the commentary on the various aspects of the power of the unconscious mind were fascinating to me. The book could have been more cohesive and explained why split second impressions can be both beneficial or detrimental. The weave of all this information was a little loose, and it tended toward repetition of the same concepts over again. I enjoyed it and have recommended it to others."
3,Good read but not much of an insight,"Well I think books like these are easy to read, easy to grasp, easy to relate to and somewhat easy to digest. This probably explains its massive popularity. However as some of the other reviewers have rightly mentioned that there's not much of an insight or new findings presented. It's just anecdotes, events, encounters and happenings of rather random nature but presented in a way that really invokes interest."
3,I Guess,"Snap judgments are arrived at by a ruthless pruning of information, which our brains process without our being aware of it. A good snap judgment occurs when the information which has been discarded is irrelevant to the matter in hand; a bad one when it is not. An overload of information leads to a paralysis of judgment, which is why information-gathering bureaucracies are often not merely inefficient but grotesquely error-prone.Gladwell's book, which starts well enough, meanders and begins to go off the point about halfway through. This is probably because the subject cannot sustain a full-length study without digression. His style is conversational and easy to read but (for me at least) too colloquial."
2,"My initial gut instinct said it was good, then i read it and it SUCKS!","Here's some words that describe this lenghty and boring book - lenghty and boring to begin, not useful, too basic, did i mention boring? Oh yes i did. Outier is a way better read. Blink is useless garbage. So disappointed.Follow your gut or don't? That is the question. Dumb question, just use your brain. Your gut is good for digestion, your brain is for deduction. Use that instead, unless you're eating a hamburger."
3,Good but not great,"I really did enjoy this book, but it didn't change my life or make me desperately want to read anything else by this author.The negatives: The start of the novel is a touch disjointed and jumps around a bit. Lacks focus at the beginning. (The book's flow is just fine at the end though). It still jumps around though. This book is racially charged and clearly written by an African American. This isn't a bad thing, but all the racist accusations are pointed toward white against black. Nothing of Islam or Middle Eastern prejudice or others. He does touch a bit of blacks being prejudiced against blacks which is interesting, but I would just love to have heard more expanded research into some concepts.Positives: If you're a fan of the TV show, Lie to Me, you'll at the very least like this book. Interesting read. Has some great incites. I'm tired of writing this review now....."
3,was not what I had expected,It was a good book. Just not what I had expected from the book based on what I had heard from a 3rd party. Not the fault of the seller. It was the fault of the person that recommended it to me.
2,"Not a ""Self-Help"" book","I've read many self-help books. I picked up this one espcially because I have ""The Thinker"" personality and it usually takes me time to take in data and decipher information before I make a decision. I can sum up the idea of ""Blink"" in a blink:When it comes to making a decision, often times, there's something inborn in us that (your gut) that can make the ""right"" decision for you in three seconds. So follow your gut! On the other hand, our guts are prejudice at times, and they can lead us to make the wrong decision. So be aware of prejudices you have before going with your gut.The book is filled with examples wherein people made wrong judgements in a blink, such as the electing of Warren Harding as US President, New Coke and Amadou Diallo. Although the books tells you that the right decision can easily come by you, it is short on HOW people can make the right decisions in a blink - and that's what's most disappointing of all."
1,This book is a disgrace,"For all of you readers who think that Blink will be as good as The Tipping Point, you are sadly mistaken. Sure, this book has fun ideas, but it also has no real point, no real insight, and offers you nothing to take away. I think this book is very much like Psych 101, you finally have a name to put to things you already know about, and can do nothing with the information but forget it. I would like to recommend that you simply re-read The Tipping Point."
4,A very entertaining read,"This book is a very entertaining one from cover to cover. It is delightfully written (I imagine that Gladwell is a great conversationalist - the writing is very smooth and pleasing).Other reviewers have attacked this book because the writer is not a cognitive expert - they have questioned his credentials and conclusions. This is not a textbook, it's a popular treatment. The author discusses intuition not on the level of psychology professors but on the level of average readers. In my view he does this very well. The author takes an anecdotal approach - each aspect of his theory is supported by his analysis of an event, sometimes backed by interviews with experts.In short, a new take on the idea of intuition that is accessible to the common man, and presented in an entertaining and thought-provoking style."
5,a grateful heart,"After a long hiatus from performing, reading this book excited me to absolutely no end! Stephen's thoughts and wise teachings brought me back to a place that I'd forgotten and was sorely missing. Thank you for the palpable tenderness and care that LEAPS off the page directly into my world and "" where I live "" Reading about acting can be confusing, right? This book magically trancends anything stodgy, incoherent, or inconsistent in structure and message. ( SO MANY acting and performance manuals DO NOT EVER get past the lumpy and condescending realm...) THIS is elegantly crafted and now sacred to me! Thank you Stephen."
2,"Poor workmanship, engineering","Though this backpack is large enough to hold a couple of suits, towel, fins, goggles, cap and pull buoy, the materials don't seem strong enough to support a full pack.The main compartment is made of a mid-grade, water-resistant canvas. The mesh pockets, though, are the pack's weakest point. They are made not of nylon, but of cheap plastic, which breaks over time, making them unusuable. The pockets are essential for storing wet suits, so once they're broken, the pack is useless to swimmers. My first pack had holes in the mesh pockets within a few months; I foolishly exchanged it for a second and now it too has holes in the mesh pocket.Furthermore, when the pack is full, the weight is poorly distributed and strains the middle back and shoulders. For the price, one can do much, much better."
3,"Awesome ""on the couch"" keyboard for HTPC, PS3, Wii, XBOX, or whatever.","Ordered this for my home theater pc, to replace a horrible Microsoft one that only worked if you were mashing the ""wireless"" receiver against the keyboard itself (yes, i tried new batteries).Also this one has a laptop-style touchpad which is way better for sofa use than a mouse which i had to lean over my coffee table to use. The touchpad is tiny though, compared to modern laptops. But for occasional use it's usable.It's good for the purpose. Plenty of range even for the biggest room, and that's even with the receiver stuck behind my giant mess of cables behind the TV.It's just a regular USB keyboard as far as your computer/PS3/whatever is concerned. No drivers or anything needed. No Windows key, so use Ctrl+Esc to bring up your Start menu. This is more awkward for a Mac because it means no Command key. You could swap the modifier keys in System Preferences.Pretty good for cheap."
4,Good wireless keyboard not just for PS3,"I don't own a PS3. When I get a PS3 I will buy the bluetooth version of this keyboard for it.I use my desktop computer as a media center for my television. Since you can't read the entire screen sitting so close to my television (using wired controllers), this is the perfect keyboard since it integrates a mousepad on the keyboard. It lets me sit on my couch while I can completely control my computer. I did some shopping around and this keyboard seems to be a steal compared to other keyboards with an integrated mousepad.Another positive is that it is thin so it can easily be stored beside my couch to keep it out of sight when not in use.One negative is that it feels pretty cheap. Another is that they didn't include a number pad above or below the mousepad. When there is plenty of room for one.I have yet to try this with the Wii or the Xbox 360 but I will try it and update my review accordingly. I've heard rumors that it works with the Wii's internet module."
5,Good quality,This is a nice quality item and was much cheaper at Amazon then the retail store. Recommend it
4,Cheap look and feel but it does the job well,"I am using this with my PS3, mostly to enter password or whatever other short text strings may be called for while surfing the Web on the PS3.One important not: this is a Wi-Fi keyboard, it is NOT blue-tooth. Meaning that it WILL require a little dongle-transmitter plugged into your USB port. If your PS3 is one of them 2-USB ports models then you must be aware of this.The keyboard is battery-powered and the batteries seem to last. I don't believe I've changed them since I first started using the keyboard, a few months ago but I am not a heavy user. It's good to know that it comes with a little touch pad and 'mouse' buttons so if you are comfortable with it, you won't need a mouse.Overall judgment: it's much better than it looks. For the price and for moderate use with a PS3, I have no complaints whatsoever, it's the right implement. I would NOT use it with a computer, especially if I was into writing big novels."
3,Works (mostly) with Macs and PCs,"Picked this up to see if it would work with Macs and PCs. While it does (although it's not bluetooth; the Mediaboard Pro is bluetooth), it doesn't have a Windows/Command key, so you'll have to remap another key (say, Caps Lock or Control) on a Mac to use command keys. (System Preferences->Keyboard and Mouse->Keyboard->Modifier Keys).Keyboard feel is not terrific, and the trackpad is small. Still, works fine as a media remote or for light use, and so for $35 is worth it."
4,Is this only for PS3 use???,"I have not personally purchased this item, but I have to wonder if this only works through the PS3's system or if it has compatibility with PC. If this has been made for exclusive use on PS3, it seems to me that it's kind of a waste of a seemingly good product."
3,Buy it for the songs from Mr. Big,"I bought this soundtrack a long while back after seeing the movie at the theatre. What a great movie, and i couldn't get enough of those 2 great rock sounds. So i quickly discovered who made em', and the band was Mr. Big. A band which never got recognition and it's a shame. They have big talent and great sound. The two songs ""Strike like Lightning"" and the song that ends the movie in the credits ""Shadows"" are both some great tracks and you won't find these songs on any other album of Mr. Big's other than this soundtrack. So whether you like the movie, like Mr. Big, or both, get this soundtrack before it's out of print for good!"
2,"no pictures, only text ?",I must see photographs of final meal and/or ingredients. It's not complete without pictures with just a text.I didn't want to try to cook anything from this book.
2,Too Disjointed for Me,"Noon is a well-known English sci-fi writer, and his wild imagaination is on full display in this surreal blend of cyberpunk, science-fiction, drug haze, surrealism, and Greek myth. Unfortunately, it came across as a little too much of too many things to keep me involved. In a Manchester of the future, the barriers between the real world and the dream or ""vurt"" world start to break down as an insidious pollen begins to reduce almost everyone to sneezing, sniffling wrecks. It all gets far too phantasmagorical for me."
1,horrible movie,"You ever want to reach into the screen and punch someone lights out, batemen was tolerable, the other two and the verbage, typical today, constant cursing and base language, where the hell is my refund for this pile of poop. Didn't laugh once, was just frustrated and didn't finish the film."
1,Sad what passes for humor...,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The ""humor"" (such as it is) is very low-brow. Writers actually got paid for creating this script? Amazing...What I can't figure out is how they got Keven Spacey to agree to be in such a crappy movie.So NOT recommended."
1,False Advertising and a Scam!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF THE MOVIE!! IT'S A SCAM!! First of all, the ""TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE EDITON"" and the other extended cut features are ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE BLU-RAY disc. If you're like me, and just own a DVD player, then you're just getting the theatrical version w/o any of the extra features. So why would I spend the additional $8 on this version? The Digital Copy, you say? Well, there is NO digital copy for the customer, but the ""right"" to stream the movie over the internet from Flixster. THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE ADVERTISING AND FRAUD!! I'm sending this back to Amazon for a refund. I've gone ahead and purchased a High Definition version from iTunes. Amazon needs to clarify these facts w/ the customer BEFORE they sell these ""combo"" versions. This movie and others like it are distributed by Warner Bros., which commonly makes these ""combo"" packages.John Paul YatesBelle, WV"
2,It's like one long joke with no punchline,"I know you want to laugh. $4 is not a lot of money. But, we're still in a recession. Wasted money isn't funny. Want to know what else isn't funny? This movie. I am typing this review WHILE watching the film. It's that boring.For a woman who loves Jason Bateman, adores Jamie Fox, enjoys Charlie Day, and likes Jennifer Anniston, I am both surprised and disappointed. I am surprised that a movie full of my favorite actors has failed to deliver. I am disappointed that it sucked. And I waited so long to see this."
5,"Great cast, great movie",This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time! We were almost literally falling on the floor laughing.Watched it twice in a row and I know we'll watch it time and time again and laugh just as much. It's that funny.
2,"Horrible Waste of Talent, Money & Time","Only made it through 20 minutes of this filthy mess of a trashy romp, and only because my wife wanted to see it. If you want to see incredibly good actors saying and doing impossibly stupid things, this is your bag of crapola for sure. I am no puritan, and can appreciate a well done movie no matter what the subject matter is. This is just swearing and sexual innuendo for the sake of shock and laughs, although there's no humor to be derived from this joke of a film. Got 2 stars because Jennifer looks absolutely stunning. The writers of this should be flogged for thrusting this on the public. The majority of US movie goers are dense, no arguing that, but not dense enough to devour this. Forget it!"
2,Movie for Middle Schoolers,"Such a letdown. I was really looking forward to watching this film just to be dissapointed. With big names like Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx I thought this movie would be a given for laughs. Many of the laughs are forced, the scenario becomes greatly unbelievable and the dialogue reminds me of middle schoolers who just discovered curse words. If you're looking for a filler in the background or are easily impressed with 4th grade writing, this is the movie for you!"
2,Bad Boss,"Three old friends make a plan to kill their bosses, who are horrible. Kevin Spacey, is Jason Bateman's boss, Jennifer Aniston is the other boss, a nympho sort of a character who constantly alludes to sex and genitalia. Colin Farrell as the third boss is the best in terms of the radical transformation that he has undertaken. He is totally unrecognizable as balding drug addict.A crazy comedy with only a little fun and very few laughs. So much talent has been wasted here including Jamie Foxx, who plays a killer for hire. Did not enjoy this film Two stars. 2/17/2012"
2,Don't believe the hype,"I don't know how this got so many reviews saying how hysterically funny it was. I don't want to undermine it altogether. Aniston did great with a raunchy role (she should take more roles likes this), Spacey was excellent ... as always (although his role in here was a PG-13 version of his character fromSwimming With Sharks (Special Edition)), and Bateman did well carrying most of the film as did movie newcomer Charlie Day. But ... the plot was mediocre and the humor died out halfway through the film. Also, what the hell is up with Jason Sudeikis? How is he cast as this ladies man ... and one in real life!? I mean Mad Men's January Jones and House's Olivia Wilde!?!?! Seriously!?!?! The guy looks like a used car salesman! I don't get how he would be cast in a role like this. But, nonetheless, the trio worked well together. An OK film but not as funny as filmgoers made it out to be."
3,Digital Copy Bull**** SCAM,"IF YOU HAVE AN APPLE PRODUCT AND WISH TO VIEW THE MOVIE ON SUCH DEVICE, GOOD LUCK!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS COMBO PACK. i tired effortlessly before reading the reviews to get this movie to sync to my iPad or hell just to get it to my itunes library. the whole reason i shelled out the extra $6; which is truely not a lot, was to be able to watch it wherever i take my iPad, will be returning mine tomorrow and getting just the regular blu-ray. will never again trust any packaging that says Ultra Violet Digital Copy!!!!"
2,"Good concept, bad execution","There were some funny parts in this movie, but it seems like the directors didn't really take advantage of them. The movie had a surprisingly strong cast and a potentially really funny plot, but in the end the main events go by way too quickly. Plot twists like being accused of a murder are great entries into comedy, but it seems before the full weight of the accusation sinks in the movie ends. I don't really know if this movie deserved 2 full hours, but at 1.5 hours it just seems like it's going through the motions."
4,"Horrible People, but also Irreverent and Funny People","""Horrible Bosses"" falls into a category of irreverent and ironic humor that is all the rage in American cinemas and television. Three hapless guys with horrible bosses come to the realization one day that their bosses are indeed horrible, and thus starts a chain of nonsensical events that basically become the plot of this movie. The best part of this movie is Jennifer Aniston, who in the best role of her career is an utterly sexy and convincing as a sex-crazed dentist.This movie is witty at times, but it can also be too lazy and convenient in other places. Nevertheless, it's still an entertaining ride."
1,Worst movie in the world,This is the worst DVD I have ever bought from Amazon and Jennifer Aniston whom I like very much just damaged her reputation by taking part in this stupid movie.
1,WTF???????????????,"Better off watching it for free on the stupid hotel service. If over 92,000 folks loved, loved loved the ""refreshing"" comedy of this celluoid idiotic waste of space, then what is there left to say? Okay, Triple hated it, reveals the thought processes of the decline of the ""new society"" and guess what, we're all in a bunch of effing trouble to see 4 star ratings over this. If you have got to see it on your bucket list, at least rent it for .99 and then pee on it, throw it away and save the rest of the country. Yep. And oh, drink plenty of Maddog 20/20 while kicking your own ass for unfolding any kind of dollar and sticking it in a red box. Anyway, watch the film more as a National Geographic ""WTF happened to filmmaking"" and perhaps maybe those who are dreaming the dream MAY just get a clue on what not to aspire to when you grow up. Piss-shaw!! Parrumph!"
1,Movie awesome DONOT buy if you want digital copy,"Seriously!!!??? No mention on package this is a new way to control the consumer. Had to down download $?!$&@!! Software on my PC and then create two new accounts with web services. Sorry, I wanted to download in iTunes like the rest of America. Wouldn't have forked over $25 to only have blu-ray, will never watch e-copy through Flixster.And they wonder why some pirate movies. Too bad I can't give 0 stars."
2,annoying movie,"Tried to watch this movie last night. It always seemed on the verge of being good, but could never quite make it. After a time, it started to really become annoying and i felt embarrassed for the actors. Kevin Spacey is on of my all time favorite actors and that's one of the reasons i watched it. Jennifer Aniston I only recognized by her voice at first. She looks like she's done something to her face. I do not recommend this movie. I could not finish it."
1,if this is really comedy....,"Could have had potential..Yet, not funny.. and not entertaining..If this is comedy, Hollywood must be on a serious decline..as well as the need for good actors.."
1,Most Horrible movie!,"Not only was the acting and humor poor, it was not a possible believable story and was in fact ridiculous. Anniston look rough nearly naked as if she had stopped working out just to play the old lady harasser unless she has gone down hill more since her previous flick with Adam Sandler. Then again, it is difficult to picture her as a whore type when she has played mostly wholesome characters in the past. There was a few funny parts but difficult to picture in mind when you have images of some actor scrubbing his butt with a tooth brush....oh that DNA!....lol. Maybe ok to rent, but would never want to own it."
3,So So,I saw this in the theatre and I don't Know if the sound was off but with Charlie Day's High pitched voice I ended up missing most of what he said. For the most part this movie was decent and I will rent it and try again.
2,Great Stars but a disappointment,"I was encouraged to rent this because of the quality of the cast. But, honestly, I could not make it through more than about 40 minutes of the movie --and at that point I was really pushing my patience, hoping it would get better. While the premise has potential for comedy, the humorous moments were few. Mostly, it was a painful, joyless experience watching the characters struggle for freedom from their horrible bosses."
4,Pretty funny,"People have different types of comedy they find humorous. I find this pretty durn funny. The cast is great (especially Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston). I laughed out loud throughout the entire movie! I recommend giving this a try, if you don't mind people trying to kill their friends bosses."
1,Low Budget High Salary for Actors,"This is the perfect example of a low budget, over-hyped, lousy movie that unfortunately attracted a few bankable box office actors . Kevin Spacey should be ashamed to be associated with this crap. I actually felt sorry for their bosses after about 20 minutes of watching this. I really liked them more than the poor victim man-boyz. What is it with the wimpy guy movies? Is this really still entertaining? Why not just watch some re-runs with David Schwimmer on ""Friends"" or anything with Ben Stiller? Not that all low budget movies stink; loved ""Bad Teacher."" This is just Bad Movie!"
1,AWFUL Movie,"I don't generally rent R-rated movies but thought I would give this one a chance since I was looking for a comedy and generally enjoy the acting of several of the actors in the movie. All that this movie did was make me more committed to not renting R-rated movies! Jennifer Anniston, what were you thinking in taking that roll? Yikes! You're a better comedic actress than this!"
3,DVD,"The item I purchased was not exactly as described, the dvd was in tact but it was inside of a cd case and not a real dvd case. the good thing about buying this was the shipping."
1,horrible movie,nasty language..nasty content.. i just didnt care for it.. if being dumb is funny im out!!! it had possibilities who doesnt want to off thyr boss?? but it went no were..blah!!!
5,one of the best movies I've seen in a LOOOONG time!!,"I think this movie is great! And not that sophomoric, '80's boob-fest, cheesy, trashy or slapstick-humor kind of funny either. I think Jason Bateman is seriously funny, loved him in Arrested Development; I also love Charlie Day in It's Always Sunny, so it's no surprise to me this is a good movie.Well, let me take that back...when this first came out I thought it was going to be stupid. Colin Farrell isn't my favorite, Kevin Spacey can go either way for me in movies, and Jennifer Aniston (I thought) has seen her better days in comedy. WRONG! I watched this by myself and laughed numerous times, was never bored, and want to watch it again when my husband gets home.It had a good beginning, the plot carried itself all the way through and the end worked out reasonably. It didn't leave me thinking, ""That's how this is going to end? Are you kidding me?"" like so many other movies do.I recommend this movie and give it ""Two Thumbs Up""!!"
2,Seriously dropped the ball(s),"This one had SOOOO much potential - great premise, great cast and could have been really cathartic for the thousands of us who have worked for borderline sociopaths. The Kevin Spacey character is a retread of his character from ""Swimming with Sharks"", a far better dark comedy with a similar plot-line, and comes closest to being successful. The Colin Ferrel character is relatable, but they really missed the potential for some great, crass humor, going instead for a few fat jokes and the like. The Jennifer Anniston character is an absolute cop-out, though. There is great potential in exploring the tough female boss, who overcompensates for her perceived shortcomings or for inherent sexism by being TOO aggressive (I've worked for a PRIME example), but instead they go for the fantasy character of the sexy nympho boss. This plotline is completely unbelievable and ridiculous. What could have been an excellently dark cathartic comedy ends up being unforgivably lazy."
1,70's satire,this product would not play in my sony blue ray player so I returned it. the replacement also does not play. its not in my player and the item is from the uk. i am not sure how it is recorded but its not worth my time to send it back again.
1,Fritz the Cat,The package was broken... Nothing good. I can't see the movies. Please take care with the international post. Some other providers use little boxes with a plastic cushion to avoid damages.Thanks
4,Sometimes perfection cannot be improved,"I bought this duo because I was curious about Mr. Bakshi's newest feature. I was disappointed with the second feature. Its workmanship was cheesey and it was made without the feeling put into the original film. It reminds me of the magic in the first Tim Allen ""Santa Clause"" film and the crap that the second and third movie produced. We live in a greedy society and true art often is the victim of greed. Buy this for the first movie if you do not already own it. If not, wait for the blu-ray version. The first movie is a masterpiece, the second is just plain crap."
2,The version is wrong,"The version delivered was for European machines, therefore we could not watch it. Am looking for an US version for next holiday season."
1,Fritz,I purchased this dvd thinking i would enjoy it. Well i was totally wrong because the dvd i purchased did not play in my dvd player's. For one the dvd was from the United Kingdom and there dvd's don't play in american dvd player's. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!
1,Not captioned or subtitled!,FYI: Unlike the television broadcast and the individual DVDs you can purchase - the DVDs in this set do NOT have any closed captioning or subtitles so the material is inaccessible to children with hearing loss. We were so disappointed.
5,So educational and fun!!!!!,These DVDs are the best!! My kids watch them all the time and they learn so much!! They don't get bored with them. They don't even realize they are learning while watching!!!
1,Great shows on poor quality discs,"These is a great collection of all the Magic School shows. However, the quality on the discs is poor. We had trouble with a number of discs from the time we first opened our box.1. Menus not workingFor example, you would click on ""Episodes"" and the disc would not respond. Eventually after 30-60 seconds it did respond. When you would click to select the episode you wanted to watch, you would again have the problem that the disc did not respond at all. This happened with a few of the discs.2. LoudSome of the discs ran very loudly (which does not happen with others discs in my player).Some of the discs have menus that worked properly, and some of the discs ran normally. However, because several of the discs had problems, I felt that the quality of the set was poor.Overall, these are just wonderful shows but the quality on my discs was quite poor. This made the discs difficult to use, frustrating to navigate, and not worth keeping."
3,Well...,"OK, if you consider the place the band was in this night it's a good show. Overall though, it's a little weak. Obviously Bruce Hornsby cooks - hello? But overall the band is tentative, and it's Vince's 9th show. God Bless Him, I just don't think Vince was the best fit for them - even though he did eventually find a place for himself in the music once he gained some self-confidence as a member of the band. (It's a shame that happened right as Garcia started to slide for the last time...) Steve Urbauer Stephen Urbauer"
2,I COULD'VE TRADED BETTER AND CHEAPER,"The first CD of this pick leaves me wondering why I bought it when I could've traded a better show for free. There's just one word that describes it, and that's BORING! Although the song list is great, the performance is not. Cold Rain and Snow isn't to be missed, but the rest is slow and heartless. Jerry is lost on Stagger Lee, and can't find him in Queen Jane either. The Iko on the second CD is awesome, but I've heard better Looks Like Rains. The 3rd CD is the only redeeming factor on this pick. The Standing on the Moon brings tears to your eyes and chills up your spine. The Miracle and It's all over now is great too, but you could probably find just as good on a tape from a good friend. In short, if I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't. Not this one."
3,Better show than this cd reveals,"This is actually a great show. The whole September 14 - 20 Madison Square Garden run is great - all 12 sets are worth obtaining. And Dick's Picks 9 is one of the better of this six show run. But with the lifeless soundboard used as the CD, you'd never know it. This is where I can't understand why the GD organization doesn't go to tapers for better versions of these shows. The same is true for Dick's Pick 6 - Hartford 10/14/83 (again, a better show than the lifeless soundboard would indicate). Get on the internet and find a superior audience copy of this show. Then you'll know why this is a show worth having, just not this version."
4,Great source of information,"Despite the comments about the recipes (none of which I have tried), I liked the book - especially the organization of it, the way the foods are listed with their important vitamin/mineral/etc. I think it is a very good book to have for any mother or father, as a source of reference, even if the recipes aren't used b/c at least you know what food is providing your child with what nutrient. I checked it out at the library, read it and wanted it immediately. My mother saw it on my coffee table, read it and also wanted it just for herself."
2,Glaring factual errors in 'hygiene' section,"The book is very informative(so far) as a basic ingredient review, but there are glaring errors on page 114-115 (paperback version)in the section entitled 'kitchen hygiene'. While cooking food to the correct temperatures to prevent foodborne illnesses is certainly important, cooking roasts to 290 F; burgers to 320 F and poultry to 360 F, will yield a totally inedible and revolting product. Likewise, reheating leftovers to 330 F will not aid in economical use of leftovers. (The correct temperatures should be approximately 140F, 160F, 180F and 160 F, respectively). Should you need exact numbers or a specific reference, almost any other cookbook will have data on proper cooking temperatires, as will your local health department."
4,It is white!,"I thought it looked silver in the picture; maybe my eyes are going. Anyways, it's metal, coated with white, rubbery plastic. I still like it though!"
4,AMAZING!!!,"Our cat has been peeing in the tub for weeks and a few times in other places around the house. She would NOT pee in her litter box. We took her to the vet to get her checked out and $200+ later they told us she was healthy and gave us a list of things to try. One of the suggestions was to try a new litter. I went to the store and saw Cat Attract. It was expensive, but I was desperate so I bought it. Brought it home, put it in the litter box and she's been going in there since!Now the only problem is that our other cat loves Cat Attract too and she would prefer to use the litter box with Cat Attract in it. Now I have to put Cat Attract in our other litter boxes. It's too expensive to fill all the boxes with this stuff, but I'll definitely mix it with a regular litter to keep my cats happy and peeing where they ought to.Thanks Dr. Elsey!"
1,Save your money,This did not work for my cat the only good thing about this litter was that it is dust free.
4,Book,"Hey guys, Just wanted to say Thanks for getting this book to me so quickly. It came in right on time for classes."
3,"OK, but not as good as expected.",I have had problems keeping all the ends together on this one and must admit that it is made more difficult because I am reading it on my kindle and it is not as easy to flick back through the book to check on details.
4,They do work,"I have used these gold plated clamps in the past and I did get better starts, faster starts, and no amperage drops. These clamps are not made for that though they are made for areas where lots of corrosion can build up on the clamps or terminals. Good qualify battery wiring that is the correct size and gauge is also important as is having a good battery like a deep cycle battery. Without those two things these clamps wont give you anything better. Lastly, you cannot mechanically clean these clamps because if you do you will strip the gold plating. If for some reason you need to clean the battery terminals then remove the clamps first. You should not need to clean these clamps but if you do then use a chemical spray on cleaner. I learned from experience that you do not clean these clamps mechanically or you will strip the gold platting right off of them."
4,"""The Hill Top!"" ""The Hill, Hill Top!!""","This is Cool-C's 2nd and last album. A good album, but no way near as good as his classic debut. It has production from Steady B, but it just can't measure up to his debut. The ""Hill Top Hustlers"" along with Steaby B put out strictly classics in the 80's, this one isn't their best work. Unfortunately Cool-C sits today in death row awaiting execution in the state of Pa. for killing a female Police Officer during a botched bank robbery."
5,Exactly,This product was exactly what they said it would be. I'm glad I picked this seller. I am looking foward to doing more business with them.
5,Shipping,"Product worked as promised, shipping was another matter. Called back after buying the item (same day) and wanted to change the shipping, was told I didn't need to as it was being shipped the same day, instead of the 3-4 day that I wanted it turned out to be week or better. Amazon could do better."
1,very dissatisfied,"I live in the Midwest. We had a very mild winter. Last spring I did a lot of research on deck stains and made the decision to use this product, regardless of the cost. I have a very large multi-level cedar deck. I power washed the deck removing all previous coats of stain used-got it down to the bare wood, replaced some cracked boards and even sanded the entire deck, spindles and all. It took 13 gallons to cover the deck, rails & spindles, with 2-3 coats on each. However, just ONE year later, the ENTIRE deck needs to be redone! It is all flaking off. I am not happy at all because of the cost of the product; secondly, because it took a few months to complete and lastly, the fact I paid someone $1000 to do it! The product I used was Sikkens Cetol SRD Semi Transparent Stain."
1,SIKKENS CETOL SRD,I USED THIS PRODUCT ON MY NEW LOG HOUSE IN GOOD FAITH ABOUT 3 TO 4 YEARS AGO. NOW IT NEEDS TO BE RECOATED AND IM BEING TOLD THAT I NEED TO REMOVE ALL OF THE PREVIOUS COAT BY BLASTING OR CHEMICALS BEFORE RECOATING. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD NOT TO TRY TO USE ANY OTHER PRODUCT OVER THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT REMOVING ALL OF THE SIKKENS CETOL SRD BY BLASTING OR CHEMICALS. I WOULD NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.
4,Interesting concept,It is very hard to focus on the now but when I have accomplished it strange things have happened. Once I saw a blue meteor go across the sky and another time I noticed a tiny bird perched on a tree limb staring at me it was a perfectly gorgeous little bird ordinarily I neverr would have seen it.
5,Woowoo!,"I bought the first half of this box set (The Golden Road) for my dad last Christmas and ended up stealing it. This Christmas I bought him this one and am trying my hardest to let him keep it but it is so tempting.BOTH of the box sets are an absolute must have for any diehard deadhead. The cover art, the bonuses, the records themselves...awesome.You won't be sorry."
2,"Death wish, death sentence, death period","Go figure, both Dead Wish and Death Sentence, the sequel, were out of print for ages until the Kevin Bacon film Death Sentence appeared in 2007. So they brought it back in print, slapped a film tie-in cover, and likely duped a few folks who thought it was a novelization or was more related to the new film.Death Sentence was the Chicago follow-up to Death Wish and has Paul Kersey taking his vigilante act on the road, just as was suggested at the end of the first film. The novel is short and brisk and not very deep, and lacks something the first one had...written almost like a film tie-in.Either way, since the Death Wish film series entered camp territory with the third one in the 80s, the regular-guy vigilante flick has been cheapo territory. Probably more for fans of the first book than movie, this isn't bad but it's just odd they didn't bring both books back in print."
1,What a let down!,"I was very disappointed in this book!I have always said that the books were better than the movies they made from them, but in this case it's not true! The movie""Death Wish"" was much better than the book!"
3,Not helpful for SAHM's looking to reenter the workforce,"Hirshman's essay is fairly straight forward, but it left me with a couple questions. She tends to portray the ""mommies"" who disagree with her ""choices"" as intellectually challenged. What is the value of coaxing these ""mommies"", who are apparently incapable of logical reasoning, back into the work force? Why would we want these ""mommies"" to make any decision that is more complex than whether to serve green beans or haricot verts with the chicken? It seems to me that the world would remain a safer place if these simple-minded anti-feminists stay at home to bake cookies, and leave the heavy lifting to the smart girls."
3,this book isan't that great.,I think the book my name is amerrica the journal of patrick seamas flaherty. was a okay book but not great.it is a good book with some boring parts. It has gtood detals though.I think it only daservs 3 stars
2,Not for heavy use,"I received this as a Christmas present in 2006. I do a lot of baking, and this was fine for light jobs (cake batter, whipping butter, etc.), but it labored with heavier things like cookie dough. The motor made a grinding noise when mixing heavy things, and stuff had a tendency to crawl up the sides of the bowl, necessitating scraping them down with a spatula. Then I tried kneading bread dough with it, and the motor died - despite Sunbeam's claims that you can use the mixer to knead dough! They don't make any replacement parts other than beaters and bowls available, so my mixer is now an expensive paperweight. It didn't even last two years."
3,Very cute but size for head questionable.,Size for the body as described but the was too small for the head and we have had to adjust. It is cute but material is very thin. Ok for the value.
3,Its OK if you don't mind a little work,"Packaging of this item was barely adequate. There was no damage to the table, but only by luck.Strangly enough, Beisemeyer - now part of Delta - doesn't even seem to know the real sizes of the rails they make for their own fence for the Delta Uni-Saw. I had to modifiy the top (shorten it by about 1/2"") before I could even mount it to the Beisemeyer rails on my Beisemeyer fence for my Delta Uni-Saw. And, I had to re-glue the mounting strip to the table top as it was never adequately mounted at the factory (was not set square and only used 3 small spots of glue).However, after all that work, it is a nice out-feed extenstion table. I bought this table as I could not justify spending twice as much for a smaller table and this one exactly matches the right side extension table that came with my fence."
4,The child with Special Needs: Encouraging Intellectual and Emotional Growth,Dr. Greenspan gives helpful information and different appraoches to help the mental health aspects of a special needs child. I have a child with autism and this book encouraged me to look at different approaches in my quest to help my daughter. The socialization aspect was a big concern and Dr. Greenspan's books gave me a starting point to work from. Read about our story in Coming Through the Fog. [...]
4,Great Understanding for those who cannot always speak,This is a very hepful and interesting insight on understanding those with special needs. Greenspan specifies a light and patient approach for the lay person as well as professionals. This book is a staple in most school districts and should be in each home.
5,Exactly as described. Smooth transaction!,"The product was exactly what I expected, and exactly what I needed! Thick, almost cushioned for comfort! The transaction was smooth and without incident or issue."
4,High School Kids Love It,"This book has gotten many of my high school students, particularly boys, really interested in poetry. They are familiar with Morrison through his music and are surprised that he is a poet. I can hardly keep the book on the shelf."
2,This collection from the three poetry books by Jim is the,"least exciting, It does however contain Jim's script for the film ""The Hitchiker."" It is also notable for having the last writting he did ""The Paris Notebook."""
2,"Ok, but def not a good movie","Movie was weird from start to finish. The accents were horrible and did NOT represent New Orleans, my birthplace. Some of the actors/actresses were good, but for the most part they were not especially 50 cent. Good story line, but again not so good acting and ending."
1,What a disappointment!,This is an exceedingly poor copy of a VHS tape -- and what is far worse -- it is significantly cut from the original. I find it very misleading that these two issues were not mentioned in the product description.
4,"Fun, needs a new edition","I got Out of Context as a Christmas present in 1989. It still gets played some 20 years later in my Wednesday gaming group. Last time we played, nobody guessed the real quote four out of seven times.A famous person's named is announced. Everyone then submits a ""bluff quote"" from the box of bluff quotes they have. All the bluff quotes and the real quote are then put on a special board. After the famous name and the quotes are read, players (or teams) choose which of the quotes is the actual quote said by the famous person announced. You score three points for doing so. Voting for a bluff quote scores one point for the person who submitted it.I think this is a great game and my Wednesday gaming group loves it. I'm hoping they come out with an updated version of this game, I think it's long overdue."
2,Comparable bedding set for less,"Hi! I just wanted to let you all know that I found a comparable bedding set by Brandee Danielle titled Starbright for A LOT LESS! We'll be purchasing that one for our little girl versus this one for that reason! It also got better reviews than this set did. Don't get me wrong...I think this bedding set is gorgeous, but the Starbright is just as gorgeous and it's $100 less!! You might want to check out this website: [...]"
2,Disappointed,I was so disappointed when I saw this pattern in the store. It definitely did not look worth 299 plus extra for all the accessories. The chennille looked dirty. The total would be over 600.ooI definitely suggest going to the store to see the product before you order it.
2,really cheap,"I was so disappointed when the set came today- the embroidery isn't straight, the fabric isn't soft and the ""chenille"" is a fabric that i have never seen before- it is overpriced and looks plain tacky- don't waste your money!!!!"
3,Old Broadway,"If you like Old Broadway this CD is fine... I thought it had more contemporary artists/performers, but it doesn't. I had seen an ad with Brian Stokes Mitchell on it ( and who happens to be one of my favorite artists/performers on Broadway), but he is not one of the featured singers/performers on this CD... so I was kind of was disappointed. Over all a nice collectors peice for the true Broadway fan."
4,The Ramones sitteth upon the Right Hand of GOD!,"The film contained references to many Ramones songs, only one of which is on the CD. Clearly, the producers regard The Ramones as the greatest rock band ever, so why not blanket the disc with The Ramones?"
3,Charles from Canada,"I know the song ""the wait"" from metallica is in the film but not on the soundtrack. Maybe that's the one you want?"
4,"Great movie, great soundtrack","The only reason I'm actually writing this review is to let my pal in Warrensburg know that his (or her) search is over...the song you're talking about is ""Roadrunner (Once)"" by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. It's an excellent song, and it's a real shame that it doesn't appear on the soundtrack. You can find it though on CBGB's and the Birth of US Punk, a nice little compilation of some early American punk songs.Anyways, if you haven't seen the movie yet, do so now. It'll put a smile on any rock fan's face and a warm fuzzy feeling in his or her respective heart, and it's pretty damn funny to boot. The soundtrack was nicely done, culling many classics from past eras in celebration of the ""majesty of rock""."
4,Great CD,"Yes, I did buy the cd without seeing the movie. But, I have my reasons. You see, my favorite performer sings two of the songs - Adam Pascal sings both ""Heal Me, I'm Heartsick"" and ""Fight"" with the band ""No Vacancy"". I was a little upset that he was given no acknowledgement on the cd for his vocal performances, but then I realized that if anyone has ever heard Adam before, they would know it's him. I did listen to the rest of the cd, and I found a lot of my favorite classical rock. Hey, who doesn't love the Doors, right. Also, the Black Keys piece was awesome as well. Still, the two songs with ""No Vacancy"" (to me) are clearly the best... but then again, I'm a little prejudiced, LOL. If you liked these two songs, you may wish to look at Adam's solo album ""Model Prisoner"" at www.adampascal.net or the soundtrack to the Musical Rent. Sorry about the biased review, I just couldn't help it."
2,Cheap movie cash-in,"Track listing only bears a remote resemblance to the movie. Many tracks are missing, or substituted for alternative tracks from the same artist, the question then remains, why bother... Can it even be called a movie sountrack?What happened to Black Shuck by The Darkness, it got replaced by the more radio friendly ""Growing on Me""...Where did Bowie's awesome Moonage Daydream dissapear to? Who knows....Avoid, it's a cheap corporate cash-in. Spend your money on some classic rock albums from Purple, Sabbath, AC-DC instead...Great movie, rubbish soundtrack...."
4,After Smoke on the water,"Could anybody tell me what's the title of the song that Jack Black plays just after Smoke on the water?, while he keeps jumping from one leg to the other one, is it in this CD?Many thanks"
4,CURIOUS ABOUT A SONG !!!!,"I am trying to find a song which is in the movie but i don't know what song it is called. it's the part where the kids are learning in class and all you hear is the song but no talking. maybe its bowie or something, but it sounds like the ramones or the who? help me!!! post the answer or somethingPLEASE!!!!"
3,With a plot only skin deep...,"Hal and his buddy see only see women on their ""hotness"" scale. Then Hal has a weird elevator experience that seems to ...hypnotize him? The plot idea is that his evaluative scale then turns to things other than physical features. The kinder a woman is, the better she looks to Hal, no matter her real appearance.Okay.This only works because of Jack Black. And the only reason to watch this film is to...see Jack Black perform. Don't expect too much here, although there are a few great laughs."
4,A fun movie!,I enjoyed it! Jack Black is always entertaining and I loved the premise that he could only see the good in a person after an encounter with Anthony Robbins.
4,Not that shallow...,"""Shallow Hal"" is about a shallow guy, Hal, who can only see women's souls (nice women= beautiful, mean woman= ugly). He falls in love with an obese woman who appears to Hal like a model...I thought that Shallow Hal had a few shallow scenes, but overall was pretty funny. Although some people may argue that the movie was about making fun of obese people, I beg to differ(I love saying that!). I think the movie was about Shallow Hal realizing it's what's inside that counts, not what's outside. I thought the movie was really sweet.I've seen a lot of movies where a boy ends up falling for a dorky girl and it's supposed to have the message ""it's what's inside that counts""(""She's All That"" is a perfect example). The only problem is a beautiful girl plays the dork (think Mandy Moore in ""A Walk to Remember""). In ""Shallow Hal"" Hal falls for a girl who isn't a an anorexic model."
4,Personality reflects real beauty...,"On the fathers death bed Hal receives some advice for his existence that he should follow as he grows up. This advice involves to only have women with external beauty, which causes Hal to have an extreme shallow outlook on life and love. One day he gets into an elevator with a self-help expert, Tony Robbins, and the elevator gets stuck between floors. Hal tells his life story to Tony and Tony understands Hal's shallow view on life and helps him see the inner beauty of people. Shallow Hal is a hilarious comedy with laughs and moral messages that most can identify themselves with, since it is a very appropriate tale of modern society."
2,a great view seeing Paltrow in a purple thong,"i tell ya I freezed the movie when paltrow stripped down to her thongy. but his movie is supposed to be about a message and then it has all these crappy non funny jokes and its stupid and the worst part is seeing JAson Alexander with that thing in his back, the little dog tail, just plain crumbby"
4,A must-see and a keeper.,"So much has been said about this movie so I just wanted to add something real quick. ""Shallow Hal"" really stands out in its genre for the last few years, you don't want to miss it. Also, I honestly and sincerely hope that you already watched ""Roxanne"" (1987) and ""The Tao of Steve"" (2000), but if you haven't, you better go back and check them out. They all dealt with the same concept, in different and equally good ways"
4,Not as degrading as others put it.,"I, for one, really like this movie. Hal is shallow for a reason. His father messed with his brain. He doesn't mean to be that way. Also, sure Rosmary is overweight, but she is also a kind, compassionate, witty character. Some jokes are unnessary but overall pretty tame. I also like Walt. I have a disability and this shows that someone with disadvantages can be successful and enjoyable to be around. This movie also shows that someone can turn around in their attitudes towards people. Rosemary's Dad was more degrading to her than Hal was in my opinion too."
4,Brilliant,I loved this movie because it challenged our perceptions of what was beautiful and how truly shallow society's perception of beauty is. Jack Black was a comedic genius in this and had a strangely loveable quality about him. Gwyneth Paltrow was wonderful as Rosemary. Definately a must watch.
5,Solid!,Fantastic product. Does its job well. Have used it heating liquids in making ice cream and other treats. Good construction and accurate. Recommended.
5,Go to the source,"A fabulous source of ideas and inspiration for mosaic artists at all levels. The designs are in the categories of: animals, birds and bees, sea creatures, symbols borders and patterns, food, and a mix of things from musical instruments to transport modes.Each design has two or three colour templates .The opening sections deal with basic techniques and materials, as well as tips on colour and design. However, the real value of the book is in the designs available for copying and I would recommend another book for the complete beginner with a bit more step-by-step guidance, The one I used for my first project was Making Mosaics: 15 stylish projects from start to finish, by Martin Cheek.This book will be an invaluable addition to the mosaicist's bookshelf, and will pay for itself many times over for the useful design sources."
2,crappy,"Your standard crappy tool set. The individual screw driver handles are really cheap, the screwdriver with different bits is not bad and the bits seem ok, the tweezers suck, the tape measure is worth about 50 cents, and the needle nose pliers are a typical cheap-o set. i would not be surprised if i saw this product at the .99 cent store. This set is not bad for the average computer tech but do not expect much."
4,Ton of Fun yet snoring and boring,Yea uhhh this game is ok. Its not challenging. There is this one vet came that is challenging thatyou have to SAVE the animals but not this one! Barbie says the same thing what a healthy girl in her shrilly little make me wanna blow voice! I mean how does she know its not a boy? Anyways my point is this game gets rreeaaallly dull after awhile! It depends on what type of game you like. If you like easy going games....This one is for you!
2,No Way,"I dont have any idea why soooo many people like this game, it did not keep me cntent for more then a little while, I expected way more. You dont acually have to ""nurture"" the pet back to health....................... And there is only about 7 missions tha you do over and over and over. Younger kids probably ,like this much more then older kids though......... oh well"
4,pretty cool,"this cd was cool,but a bit too easy. i finished the eight missions in record time. The monkey part was kinda hard, but with the help of the manual, i had it done quick. it was an ok cd."
4,Ireland as you've never seen it!,"Ms. Brandner brings northern Ireland and it's 'troubles' to vivid life in this first book of her trilogy. There is love, adventure and, yes, violence in this very well researched historical novel. The characters are real and their problems will become your's. You'll feel their passions, outrage and determination. The villains are superior as well! Don't miss this one!"

1,"Nice articulated arm, but bulb sticks out from shade !","This lamp has a very nice, easy to manipulate articulated arm. It movessmoothly in all directions and is plenty long enough. BUT...The shade is very small and the bulb extends below the shade! Thismeans that the bulb shines directly into your eyes when you have itabove your newspaper (say) over the table. I can turn it a bit sothat it points away from me, but then it points toward my wife andshe gets angry with me.The shade and bulb mount assembly are flawed. The bulb should notextend beyond the shade.1 star."
3,Not What I needed,"I bought this book as part of a nutrition curriculum for preschoolers. I will be skipping this lesson because although the book is very informative, it is also very technical and includes too much information for pre-k or kindergarten kids. I think they will tune out & I'll end up with some distracting behavior going on."
4,An Important Relic,"I was fortunate to see Quicksilver Messenger Service in concert on two occasions, and this welcome release is a terrific souvenir of a great band. The sound quality is hardly state of the art, but that's a minor quibble. Of primary importance is the fact that this is the only live document (except for bootleg recordings) of QMS with both John Cippolina and Dino Valenti in the line-up. And as David Crosby once declared, Valenti ""does his level best to stir up your guts with a spoon!"" I prefer Dino's ballads (check out his 1968 solo album), but here he's obviously ""up"" for a largely high voltage gig. Even if one finds his voice an acquired taste, the double leads by Cippolina and Gary Duncan are not to be missed. In the final analysis, well over half of what's presented here is essential Quicksilver."
3,Could someone tell me what role Peter Wingfield played?,"Does the acting world not realize what a gem they have in this man? If you do not remember him, his most famous role was the character Methos in Highlander: the Series in the mid-90's.Anyway, I am extremely curious to know what capacity he played in this particular film? Thank you to anyone who could respond."
5,The Spider and the Fly,This book has amazing illustrations. Children love the macabre tale of the spider and the fly. I read this every year to my kindergarten class and it always gets rave reviews from the kids.
1,What happened to the writer?,"We just loved the series until this Thanksgiving ""turkey"" release. Could they not afford the prior writers and actors? Did the purducer allow his grandchild to write a film while still in fifth grade? Skip this one, no really, I mean it... and, if you don't listen to me, you will remember my warning witnin five minutes after viewing this bomb."
3,Let's get back to the original!,"This movie was ok, but not as good naked mile or beta house, which truthfully isn't saying to much. Can't wait to get back to the original with Reunion! P.S. The Canada scene was pretty funny (lockjaw)."
5,Daughter's order,The movie and the cover were in perfect shape... My daughter was very happy to get it. Thank you very much...
1,"Not Clear,,,","I've studied this book and followed the directions to the letter. I have not seen anything I desired be manifested just by lighting a few colored candles. This workbook doesn't really explain much, sure it tells you what color candles to light for a certain date, hour, and minute. However, that is all. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be lighting 3 or 4 candles."
4,Good little film buff style film,Who Is Cletis Tout? is about a minor league crook and takes on a false identity who happens to be top of the pops for hitman. But the film is not a thriller. It is a light comedy with a mine of stuff about other films laced through it. Tim Allen has his best role to date and it all works well.Well worth a look.
3,History Yes Technologicaly accurate NO,"If you want a concise and brief history of Russian/Soviet Airborne arms development this is a good book for you. However there are so MANY Technical screw-ups in the book to make it almost worthless as a Desk reference. Many tables have the wrong designations, Incomplete data, misspelled words etc. Worst off is this book does NOT include information about many particulars of weapons systems. Even Obsolete ones. If you want technical information on weapons, you are far more likely to find it in Yefm Gordon's Famous Russian Aircraft series.Mikoyan MiG-31 (Famous Russian Aircraft)The MiG-31 book in that series is by FAR more complete on the R-33/R-37 family than this book for example."
2,His worst offering,"A bad Kundera is still better than most. But this is a regrettable book. Kundera's worst aspects are all on ample display here: his clumsy, if not indifferent, depictions of women; the valorization of the sexual conquest (coupled with degradation here); and his philosophical and historical musings. At his best, Kundera makes these weaknesses into a plus. (Don't ask me how but they work.) Here, these qualities are all parts of a carnival of pathos.It is as if Kundera decided to write the appendix to 'Immortality.' But this time around the structure isn't so surprising. The originality is, the second time around, presented as farce."
5,slowness in all its glory,"nobody ever understands how and why I read this book slowly as I did. The burden of each word had been as heavy as its brilliant title. I don't know if I had been influenced by the title itself, but i was reading half a page each day. But the meaning was so wonderfully crafted to be dense and gliding back and forth in the story, that it took me ages to come out of that party with the character. I do not recommend this book (though it is small in size) to the light reader who does not know what deep thought is. On the other hand, this book CAN teach someone how to think."
2,A cheap program with some big gotcha's,"Sure, this program is [cheap] compared to [the expensive] Movie Magic Screenwriter 2000 or Final Draft, but this program is so loaded with technical glitches and gotchas that I can't recommend it unless you're planning to write and print a single short screenplay for a school assignment or something like that. The documentation says you can export your text into other programs, but you can't! So whatever you write is locked into this limited-feature program forever, unless you want to retype it all. There are lots of other things promised by the manual or box cover but not delivered in the program. If you have any fantasies of actually writing and selling a screenplay, don't buy this product. Save your money and buy one of the industry standard programs instead."
1,very dissatisfied with product,"Having to put the disk in each time I want to launch is a major pain and buyers should be warned of this unusual requirement. For those who travel, it is really a nuisance.But my biggest issue is I can't get the program to start up half the time. I am spending more time with tech support than writing. And I have little enough time for that as it is. I thought the program was going to save me time. It hasn't and, at the moment, I've lost an entire script, which I cannot access."
3,revised review,I feel like this would be an excellent start for people who are interested in writing.
1,Be Aware. Be Very Aware!,"I returned this item because the manufacturer takes great pains to keep secret the fact that the application will not work unless you insert the CD every time you start the program. Not every time you want to install or modify the program, every time you want to use it.Aside from the ethical questions this raises, it is infuriatingly inconvenient. The fact that this ""feature"" is nowhere mentioned on the packaging or in the company's advertising -- perhaps because no one would buy it if they knew? -- made me wonder what other surprises await the customer. I decided not to find out.If you are a serious writer, you could create your own screenwriting template in a word processing application for free in a fraction of the time you will eventually spend fetching the CD, inserting the CD, waiting for the program to recognize the CD, removing the CD and filing the CD every single time you want to use this program."
2,Do not buy for kids older than 7,"I gave this game only 2 stars because for the age of the child that used it that's all the it was worth. However, the graphics where cool, and for any child 4-8 they should love it, but older then that it was a little boring."
2,"One good song, rest pure 80's","The first song, ""Celebrate"", is excellent. The rest of the CD is lower-mid level 80's pop. The ballads really don't work."
5,Realistic Flight! VERY cool to watch.,"After enjoying our bird kite for months, I am writing this review almost only for the sake of an alternative opinion to the other reviewer's negative comments. I'm not sure where they went wrong, but this has not been our experience at all.This kite is great!! It gets so many questions and positive comments.Well, except that a neighbor at first asked us to take it down because their dog kept barking at it because it looked so realistic! He finally got used to it after a few days and stopped barking. So all is well.At any rate, this also works great to deter birds from the garden and it looks wonderful doing it.A thumbs up on this kite!"
4,"Served its purpose, with small design flaw","This clothesline, once rigged, was effective for its intended purpose. However, it has one design flaw, which is that both ends terminate with open loops. One end can be secured to a towel bar by leading the line through the eye of the loop on one end. But, this means that the bathroom needs have at least one post over which the loop on the other end can slip over to be anchored. Bathrooms we stayed in lacked such a post, so to secure the second end we had to use a pen to secure it. A hook on the second end would have been more versatile."
2,Ummm...did not work,"I read the amazing reviews for this clothesline and purchased it to use on my month long European adventure.Sadly, this clothesline was terrible and didn't do anything it was supposed to do. I could hardly hang 2 small garments on it and they would fall off within 10 minutes even though I'd spend 10 minutes trying to secure the garment to the crevices in the clothesline.I just didn't find this a quality or useful product. And for more than 10 bucks....I don't think so."
4,Amazing,"An absolutely amazing read: probably the best book ever written. Travel with Ivan to Reno, NY and Yugoslavia and meet some of the scariest successful failures imaginable, and try to remember that it isn't fiction! These are portraits of our fallen heroes illuminated with Diogenes' halogen pen - yes, that really was ex-NY Jet superstar Mark Gastineau hoisting his teenage girlfriend's mom onto an exercise bike; yes, that really was the Godfather of Soul contrite before a local judge; and yes, it really was a bearded Bobby Fischer leading his circus into the war zone. Ivan has finally demonstrated his mastery of the craft, but God! I wish it were fiction. The Yankee stadium scene, with all of the unbelievable but utterly commonplace losers, hit home a little too hard. He has made a strong argument about neo-nihilist America, and it, ironically, is only his success as an author that counters it effectively."
2,Oedipus Rex,"While it is beautifully filmed the grunting instead of dialogue got irritating. I bought it to show my students in my Literature class, but I couldn't get thru it, I figured they couldn't"
3,Too bulky,"I've been looking for a watch to replace a couple of broken Casio F-105A Illuminators that I've been nursing along with broken bands and run down batteries. I like the low profile of the F-105A but do get tired of the inadvertent bump from 12-24 hr and having to reset on months more or less than 30 days. So far, I've struck out with Casio and Timex. The Casio DW290-1V has all the functions I wanted, especially the Illuminator, but it is just far too bulky for my taste. It's 3-fold the mass of watch that the F-105A is and just won't work for me. Although I've never owned one, it seems to resemble the G-Shock series more than not. I'm tall, on the thin side and my wrist is probably considered small. I want a watch that I'm not constantly reminded I'm wearing that has a stop watch, timer, alarm, a day and date function and can be seen at night. If the DW290-IV was half the size, I'd keep it. Because of its bulk, however, it's going back."
4,good watch,the thing that i find annoying is when u want to adjust the digit u can't move them back only forward.
4,Casio DW290-1V,"I am quite pleased with this watch. I wanted a G-Shock, but this is as close as one could get and loving it!"
3,useful but not magnificent,"This is a great little pot for making small quantities (sauces, gravies, or cooking dried beans). It's easy to clean too.It lacks some nice control features (such as a timer), which means it's not as hands-off as other slow cookers. I have a Crock Pot Smart Pot which is truly worry-free. I can set the timer and leave it alone all day, and it will automatically switch to ""warm"" at the end. It's HUGE however, which is why I bought this smaller one.This is fine as long as you will be around to supervise it... you'd need to manually switch the temperature or turn it off since there's no timer. But otherwise it's a fine machine. No problems, just no bells and whistles either."
4,Cute Little Crock Does the Job,"It's easy to set up, use, and clean. I appreciate it takes up so little space.If only it had a timer. However I can purchase one."
5,A great bargain for small families,This product is exactly what I was looking for. I can cook small meals for myself and it is dishwasher safe.
5,Healthy breakfast cooking while I sleep,"Perfect size for oatmeal! I purchased this a month ago, and I make a batch of oatmeal every 5 days for my daily breakfast. Compact enough to stay on the kitchen counter for continued use."
5,perfect size!,This is the perfect size for fondue's and two person dinner servings! Most nights I only cook for two and that doesn't require my large crock pot. This one is a nice size.
4,Great for side dishes. Works great!!!!,"We bought this little guy for a party that we recently had.We used one crock pot to hold nacho cheese and this tiny one to hold a batch of pulled pork.The size was great for this task, not too big or small. It kept the pulled pork nice and hot for hours and heated up quickly to start.It did it's job and was easy to clean up.I recommend!"
4,A Brave Film about Profound Cruelty,"This film goes to the heart of the times we live in. It is about cruelty in the most profound and disturbing sense - the atrocious, ugly things we know of and read in the paper everyday, but somehow can't fathom. Art is the only tool that allows us both understanding and the possibility of moral and social reponse. Some think this is a perverse, even evil film - but they are deeply mistaken. It is indeed about evil - it is also about the ability of the artist to look at evil and give it definition and deny it its mystery. If we feel violatesd by this, it's because we are denied the comfort of ignorance. At its center, Salo is a film of the highest moral order. In the century to come, it will be better understood. And its courage will be appreciated"
1,This movie is awful.,"This movie sucks, don't see it. I really wish I would have streamed this film before I paid $18 for it. I wanted to see this movie simply because I refused to believe it was as disgusting and horrible as everyone seems to say it is. Short answer is it's not, it's just stupid. I get that it's supposed to be an artsy movie and a graphic analogy for fascism or whatever but that doesn't mean it's a movie worth watching. The only redemptive quality it had was almost putting me to sleep because of how extremely boring and bland it is. Full to the brim with bad acting, bad dialogue, and bad ""special effects"". What a waste of time and money."
1,What's the point of all this?,"While watching this film, I kept wondering, what's the point of all this? Many reviewers rave that it depicts how cruel and debase humanity can be. My thought, is, duh, really? You don't need to watch this movie to make you realize that, just study all of the human atrocities committed throughout the history of the world. Better yet, pick up any daily newspaper and read about all of the homicides and other criminal acts that occur everyday!There really is no redeeming qualities to this film, I found it to be stupefyingly boring, with stuffy direction and repugnant yet somewhat phony looking violent and sex scenes.I found the number of positive reviews for this film much more disturbing than the film itself!"
1,horrifying/appalling/nauseating,"I ordered DVD based on review in major weekly magazine...i am not thin-skinned, overly sensitive, or prudish but i could not make it even half way thru this movie.Movie contains graphic scenes of extremely deviant sexual behavior and abuse."
4,Good but not terrific.,"I had to buy this to add it to my DVD collection. I would have kicked myself in the you know what if I hadn't. I have watched it, but my husband hasn't yet. I honesty looked at the film as a depiction of de Sade's sick mind, and well, it worked. It's still screwed up, but if you decided to watch the film, you knew that before you started watching it, and if you didn't, I'm not sorry."
1,Some masterpiece....,"There are so many reviews here that hail this as a masterpiece, as a landmark in cinema history...and then they complain at the poor acting, editing and script. So what exactly makes it a masterpiece then? Beats me.Ok, you have to admit that the main reason people watch this is to get shocked, offended and generally freaked out at some of the weird stuff they'll see, but at the end of the day I found it boring. Yes, even the 'distrubing' scenes seemed so over-the-top that they just didn't seem realistic, and after it all ended I felt violated. I felt like someone had come into my house, destroyed my belongings, beat me up, beat up my parents, raped me and made me eat s**t. That's basically what the films about. And if you enjoy watching that... you need help."
1,Trash rubbish,"total trash rubbish...if you fancy eating human feces this is the movie for you. im sorry but im a music and film collector with the most sophisticated taste and I do appreciate or ""dig"" even the most incomprehensible stuff but this was just awful. I tried hunting down this movie after hearing all the controversy and finally i got one but to my surprise it was all junk. i suggest for all those who are spending so much money to watch the movie, save your energy and money get Caligula instead. This movie is just TERRIBLE!!!"
3,lol,I thought it was funny as hell (but I'm weird). Too much gay stuff in this movie though. Definitely surprising.i would give it 4 stars because it can hold anyone's attention but there is too much male nudity so i give it 3.
3,The wicked perish by their own wickedness.,"I guess there are times in live when you might want to consider things like those in this movie.It's clearly about shock value and Sadism.Some people get bored with the world and come up with crap to keep it interesting.The movie is almost laughable because the victims seem like willing participants to me anyway.My mother would always say, ""It's a boring person that's bored."""
1,Insulting!,"Ms. Campbell's book slams the childfree and the childless, using Bible verses--many incorrectly--in an attempt to prove her point. She is affiliated with a fundamentalist Christian ministry that is anti-women's rights in any arena. The author even includes a quote in the book that states that those who have no children are ""useless"" to society. The list of ""101 Reasons Why Mothers Love Having Children"" paints a picture of parenting as always being worthwhile and rosy, instead of being realistic about what parenting really entails. Avoid this book!"
2,Be Fruitful and Multiply,"I do agree with some parts of this book, but I believe that she takes a lot of verses out of context. I would not really recommend it to study. There are better books out there."
1,"Trust in God, But Tie Your Camel to A Tree","Another wacky tome pushing a thoughtless, selfish worldview that claims to be Christian, but is right out of the Dark Ages. No, I'm just kidding, I support her premise -- having another kid is as easy as picking up another quart of milk at the supermarket. Don't worry, be happy, if you all starve, you can blame it on God's will. Worked out great for Andrea Yates, didn't it?"
1,Really terrible,"Bola de Nieve was a good lounge singer, 50's style, from Cuba; he spoke his songs over music rather than singing them. Today his art sounds a little passé and unpolished, but if you are Cuban you still find something endearing in his old recordings... Poor Bola must be turning in his grave now that this awful CD is out. It's simply agonizing to hear, grating on the ear, appallingly unmelodical, with a maudlin style that's more psychotic than heartfel (which is not at all). Save your money and buy the real Bola de Nieve. You might like him."
4,"pleading ""not guilty""","Night and Fog - Criterion Collection,Night and Fog (Enhanced) 1955Except for Albert Speer, none of the leaders of Nazi-Germany on trial in Nürnberg for their crimes against humanity felt any guilt. The analogy to our present crimes against the creation (our destructive exploitation of nature and triggering global warming) is obvious. This documentary provides valuable data for Gerald Edelman's Theory of Neuronal Group Selection that might help us find ways to counteract our irresponsibility."
5,Debbie Gibson,"She is a very talented lady, unfortunatly the early 90s doomed a lot of great artists, I think a lot of people were shafted back in the early 90s. This album went gold but it is quickly forgotten because Anything is Possible only charted at 26, Debbie is talented but I suggest ""Electric Youth""."
1,"Even I, a huge RW fan, hated it!","Okay, it was kind of interesting at first, but then the whole movie and its supposed quality just dropped like the stock market. I felt ashamed that I had seen it and wasted 2 hrs of my life watching it. I felt even more ashamed that MTV actually made it."
1,worst RW ever!,"this is by far the worst RW i've ever seen. It was so pathetic. It was a terrible plot, terrible actors, and just terrible all together. don't waste your money. I wouldn't even spend a dime to purchase this load of garbage!!"
3,Fits under sink,"This plastic piece fit pretty well under the sink and my main purpose was if there was a leak I didnt want the cabinets to get damaged. The little dividers that it comes with is pretty useless, the minute you brush your hand on it , it comes out ."
2,Didn't enjoy,"While Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are fabulous actresses, I had a difficult time with this plot. In fact, there wasn't one. Mysterious young Polish man gets washed ashore. Two old maids take him in. He is healed. He plays the violin beautifully. Judi Dench falls in love with him. He goes away and becomes a concert violinist. End of story. Kind of a film festival-type film. There was no climax, no real problem solved. I don't enjoy the kind of plot where a poor old maid realizes for the first time in her life that she hasn't ever had romance, and probably never will (especially if she keeps falling for young men). Kinda depressing. They even threw in the f-word to try to attract certain audiences who evidently enjoy hearing those types of words. Kind of a dive for two celebrated actresses."
4,Wonderful!,"I loved this movie, the setting, the relationship of the women, the easy pace of the story, and particularly the music. Their is one odd quirk in the story, being that the women become sexually attracted to the young boy which the story centers around. It was too weird, and absolutely unnecessary. It would have been much more believable to limit their relationship with the boy to simple rivalry over his affection. As it is, I feel uncomfortable to have my young teenagers watch it. All in all, I will ignore it and enjoy the wonderful music and the women."
1,Dull and ridiculous,What would she do with him if she did catch him? Pass this one by if you see it on the shelf!
3,Movie for Ladies Night,I got this movie for our monthly Ladies night. It was a good movie but was darker than I expected.
3,Ladies In Lavender,"Dame Maggie Smith is very strong but the part Dame Judi Dench is given is 'wet' - for it does nothing to show her true acting/filmic talents (as the strong, powerful, dominating woman). However, the settings are great and Andreas the stranded violinist plays his part convincingly. Other than falling down in the area of the 'tormented older vicarious female lover' role that Judi is given, this is still a fine film and well worth watching. It rates as one of those Dench films that you will talk about and recommend to fellow enthusiasts."
3,I have seen better!!!!,"This program is ok. But FictionMaster better for pro's and WritePro is better for newcomers. I can't understand why Amazon doesn't seem to have either (try writepro.com for both.). Both have won alot of praise from both computer pros, and writting pros. And the Software is done by a real pro writer, one of the finest writing teachers around, Sol Stein. I have taken some of his workshops. He teaches the pros."
1,Dramatica-How Undramatic !!!,"I spent my Christmas money for this product expecting a lotmore than I got for .... So now I'm both broke and storyless. Thanxfor all they hype and no help, Dramatica."
5,Does what it promises,"I've been disappointed more than once by software that promises to make life easy in some way or another. I've bought software that promised to help me write a business plan, one application that was supposed to help me design a house, and one package that would teach me Italian. In each case those applications did about of what they promised. Dramatic, though, delivers. For me, coming up with a story idea is easy. I can write dialogue without breaking a sweat. My weakness is getting bored with all the details required to construct a long-form story. Dramatica makes it fun. It doesn't make it easy. It might even make the process of story development a little harder, but if you use it, you'll have a better-developed story with deeper more interesting characters."
2,Disappointed but I may not be the intended audience.,"The sad truth is that there are no great software products for creative writing. With all the great reviews this product was getting I decided to purchase it. After installing it, I realized I needed to do a bit of homework before I could use it. I tried but eventually gave up and resorted back to just using a word processor.The user interface is terrible. It looks like something from the 80's. They need to rework the interface to bring it up to current standards.I should say that I am not a professional writer. It's possible that someone who writes as a career could fine this to be a worthwhile product. For myself, I was just looking for a creative writing tool to help me get started."
3,Ying Yang Sword,When I recieved my sword it didn't look as pretty as the picture. The blade was a bit loose but it takes a second to tighten. The blade isn't as flexible as I would like and the scabbard was scratched to hell like someone kicked it across the floor.
4,Medieval Illustrations Set A Certain Tone That Fits This Work,"This 18th century translation of the 500-year-old Christian classic has both beautiful Medieval illustrations and an archaic tone to its passages that work well together in removing the reader from the confines of contemporary life and putting them inside the mindset of the monk who wrote this meditation on imitating the life of Christ. This is the version of this work to have, in my opinion, far better than the endless, text-only editions of this we had to wade through in theology classes in high school. I've always liked The Imitation, even though I recognized early on that its lofty goals were absolute impossibilities for we imperfect mortals."
3,The Imitation of Christ: Illustrated With Illuminated Manuscripts,"This book takes excerpts from the larger work, ""The Imitation of Christ"" by Thomas A. Kempis and sets them with beautiful, classical artwork. It was recommended to me by a spiritual advisor for the purpose of daily meditation. It is an excellent book to that end. The language remains in the archaic Christian form of ""thou's"", ""followeth's"" and ""camest's"" which slows the reading pace a bit. However, the message is powerful and used along with the readings of scripture, it will help in keeping one focused on the true values in life. Bro. Mac"
5,"Ilike the books on the Mckinzies, I would like more of them.","The kook on the McKinzies mountain and the mission were just Great ,I also like where they always got the family togeather, it shows much love for each one even Chance, I would like one where Chance finds some one and gets married,"
5,A long-term watch!,"I've had this watch for 11 years. I work outside, typically in heavy woods and it's never let me down. I have had to replace the battery maybe 3 times but it was worth it. I've probably purchased 5 or 6 watches since I bought this but I always end up coming back to this G-Shock because every single other watch I have owned cannot stand up to the abuse of my job-even watches I've paid 3 times more than what I paid for this. Also, I'd note the price is about the same that I paid 11 years ago. So it seems the watch is an even better deal today than it was then!Edit 12/2010: Just replaced the battery in this watch again. Good as new, 13 years into owning it. I'd also point out I lost the gasket that serves to keep the watch waterproof a couple of battery changes ago. However, I've taken this watch to the beach and shower in it daily and have never had a problem with moisture, even with no gasket!"
3,"Good Seller, Squeaky Speakers","The seller from whom I received this product was very timely, and I received the correct order. However, ths speakers have a tendency to squeak every once in a while. Although this product is not cheap, it isn't expensive either. I guess you get what you pay for, and for that reason, I am happy with my purchase."
1,poor product,"unfortunately I purchased this as a gift and it was a great disappointment. Even tried ordering it a second time, with the hope the first one was just a fluke... WRONG! Terrible product and shipped the replacement one back as fast as we discovered the same issues .. poor contacts with the control buttons. I was embarrassed by the poor quality of this 'gift.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURER."
3,Great size but sound quality is not there,"I purchased this product for a good friend of mine for xmas. We actually listened to it after she opened it. It sounds ok until you turn the volume up loud. Lower volumes sound great. When you turn it up there is a popping sound that distorts the sound.This would be nice just for your office desk when you would listen to it with a lower volume. I was disappointed because all of the reviews say that it has a nice sound. Not entirely true. Or maybe I got a lemon, who knows."
4,Very Happy!,"I normally don't review items, but I do faithfully look at the reviews before I purchase an item. In this case I felt compelled to review the speaker. I am very happy with my purchase. For the price the speaker is surprisingly good. If your looking for a speaker that replaces your whole stereo system this is not for you but if your looking for a speaker that is a good price and has a good sound consider this one. I however, use it in my office and it suits my needs. I haven't experienced the static that other reviewers have mentioned. The only thing is the adaptor supplied for the Ipod Nano didn't work with my Nano 2nd generation. But, not to worry. I left my nano in it's ""ToughSkin"" slip case and put the Ipod mini adaptor behind it and it seems very secure and works great!"
4,Nice product,"Item wasn't the best quality, but for the money it works great! I am perfectly happy with the sound and the fact that I can now charge my ipod without the computer. It is also great that you can use any kind of ipod with this unit since it comes with all the adapters for use with all the different ipods."
2,Review of the IPOD Round Speaker,"I am very dissapointed in this product. When it starts to plays, it makes a loud squeaking sound, and if you turn up the volume it sounds horrible. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Not compatible,"This item is not easily compatible with a 2010 ipod nano. I contacted the company, and they said it was produced in 2006. I can play the music on my nano using these speakers, but I can't do that and charge the ipod at the same time. The ipod can't play music while in the dock - you have to take it out and plug in an additional (included) cable. So it works, but not while it's docked and charging. For me, part of the convenience of the product is that I can play and charge at the same time...not so much with this!"
1,Complete ripoff of JBL's On Stage I & II,"JBL originated this design in 2004 (winning design awards) and Im surprised CTA isnt being sued with this obvious ripoff. However, reading thru the reviews theyve only copied the outer design and the rest of it is complete [...]. I ended up owning 4 of the JBL's. My mom has one, and I use the other 3 in various rooms and travel. I would not support CTA just by the fact they couldnt come up with their own original design. Then again, the reviews say its not that good either. Make your choice, live with it."
1,Defective,"The docking caused my ipod to freeze up multiple times and always caused glitches in the music. I started using it with the cable to plug it into the speakers and not dock it, and the music sounded like it was in a bubble. The unit kept turning itself off every five minutes. Returned it after 3 days of constant baby sitting just to get it to work instead of being able to enjoy my music."
5,Most Comfotable Docs Ever,"These shoes are lightweight, good looking, soft and extremely comfortable. I have bought three pair for my husband who works in construction areas. They get pretty beat up, but are very durable. I highly recommend these shoes for everyday wear and for those who don't need a steele toed shoe. They can only bought online which is a shame."
5,Great Little Printer!,"I bought this printer and so far, I have not had a single problem. I was so sick and tired of my ink jet printer cartridge getting clogged up after not using it for a couple of days that I had to make a switch to laser.It takes about 10 seconds to warm up, but after that it prints very quick. It prints black text perfect, with all fonts nice and dark. It even has the option of placing a watermark on the paper. Labels and envelopes print good too, with no jamming. Not too shabby for a laser printer that cost me ... (after rebate). I would not recommend this for anyone that wants to print graphics.I couldn't imagine using an ink jet printer again; and with a price and performance like this Lexmark, I will never have to again!"
1,Did not receive the watch!!!,"I have not received the watch!!Where is it????You charged my credit card but I never got the watch.Richard Siefert8596 Alessandria CtNaples, FL 34114239-732-5885"
4,Very useful watch,"This is the third time I have bought this model. I first bought it or a similar model about 15 years ago.The good: Accurate (of course), easy to use timer, stopwatch and calendar alarm functions. The calculator works. I don't use the other (time zone, daily timer, directory) functions. It illuminates easily and well.The not so good: Replacing the watch band or battery is a pain."
5,pretty cool book,"i recommend this book versus the one book ""talking"". seems like a condensed version of his autobiography, i like it a lot. good book, good quality, shipped with the other book"
5,Great for understanding the field,"This was a real find because it helped me understand the background to magic(al) realism and provided good food for thought about where it is going next.I like the way the author shows the links between the painters, writers and film makers in particular.There are some fun surprises, such as finding that Paddington Bear has his magic(al) realist side!"
5,Joseph Brodsky Rules!!,This is a superb biography of the great Russian Nobel Laureate Poet Joseph Brodsky along with his powerful readings.He Rules!!It's a must see video!!
4,Disturbingly fascinating,"Lafferty had himself pigeonholed as a science fiction author, but the SF veneer here is fairly thin, with a little fantasy thrown in. If anything, the story has fewer ""impossible"" elements than most of his stories. This story of Irish immigrants in the rural Midwest (or if you insist, alien Puca immigrants to Earth) is strangely savage, marked by the author's typically surreal violence and verbal extravagance. Think of Tom Sawyer rewritten by Stephen King, and you may get some idea. Better yet, just read it.By the way, I do not think the last line of the chapter title poem ""Or Altered World or Dead Dulanty"" is a typo. I've seen that slightly awkward formulation of Either/Or somewhere before."
3,desperate italian housewife,"Rosalba, a slightly overweight woman in her forties, is left behind on a family vacation. Rather than return to her family, she finds her way to Venice and a romantic encounter with a waiter named Fernando. Will she find the romance she longs for, or return to her family and the hum drum of whatever it is we call normal life?"
5,"Ah, Romance!",Wonderful escape movie. Fun characters - great scenery. Warning: if you are a housewife you WILL have a hard time appreciating doing laundry for a while.Grab your favorite friend and a bunch of flowers and enjoy!
4,mother deserts family for 'love',"where are all the pro-family types in these reviews? everyone seems to love this movie - about a house wife who is hare brained enough to miss the bus that is taking her and her family on a tour, and then frivolously embarks on a 'new life' in, of all places, venice. who wouldn't fall in love in venice? a dead person? yes, she meets a man (a father who has death fantasies, ie he would desert his own grand son) and falls in love with this guy - a waiter in a restaurant. licia manglietta is a delightful 40-something actress in the main role. uh, rest assured in the united states they would've recast the role with a 20-something ditz brain. this is a delightful movie - please check your morals at the door."
1,warning,even though cute david is NOT singing on any of these songs the cd s ok there s even walk away andy hill new pearl but only1star cause i dont like to be misled before going to bed
5,go see him live,"I've seen Marc Broussard live 3 times now (basically every time he's in Pittsburgh) and its always incredible. Go see him live, and notice this: he plays his entire set through without pausing between songs for more than a minute. Its just ridiculous the amount of energy he has; it makes the good songs great, and the great songs drop dead silly.Carencro is a strong, strong album, and a lot of the tracks (notably ""Home"") play great live. I saw him with Gavin Degraw and Toby Lightman, and he stole the entire show. Just ran away with it, I think Degraw couldn't compete with his energy, and the crowd thinned a bit during the headliner's performance. Buy Marc Broussard's albums, but definitely see him live."
1,Just Not Worth Buying The Whole Thing,"This CD contained a few good songs, but for the most part was a collection of second rate pop ballads with lyrics that would make any objective listener cringe."
3,"Great Performer, Cheesy Producer","Broussard puts on an amazingly powerful, soulful and moving live performance, which is why the CD is so disappointing by comparison. I blame the producer, Marshall Altman, for burying Marc's talent under all that glossy overproduction. He really sucked the life out of the music. Marc's talent still shines through, but you only get glimpses of what he really does when he's running his own show. Marc, FIRE the producer! You know who'd really be good with you? Don Was. Marc has just enough in common with Bonnie Raitt stylistically that it seems like they'd match up well."
4,Hillarious!,"I heartily enjoyed this DVD, and is a must see for all Spongebob fanatics and newbies to the show alike! Although I had only once seen the TV show before, I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who, like me, doesn't get this channel.The verdict: OK Buy, Excellent Rental"
2,Ummm...,"I'm sure there is more advice in this book than what I've gathered so far, however, the style of writing for this book made it completely unappealing. It is written in the form of transcripts taken from conversations the author had with two different clients. At first I thought that may help me relate to the information better, but instead it just made it harder to find the information that would be helpful to me. The book also doesn't explain in anyway how to apply these audition success techniques to your life, so overall I didn't like the format of the book and it was very unhelpful to me. The author has another book titled ""Fight Your Fear and Win"" that is ten times better in that sense."
1,Crossed signals,"Support your hardworking local semioticians -- and don't buy this book. Donald Norman needs to learn the difference between a few 3x5 cards' worth of lecture quips and an actual, fleshed-out, sustained literary effort. He has some very alluring ideas here about how symbolism works in modern society, and apparently he thought that was enough to write and sell a book. Let's do him a favor to keep his next book from stumbling into remaindered-land, and ask him for some discipline and depth next time"
5,Beautiful Peaceful Butterfly Suite,"The case got broken, which was disappointing, no doubt postal services. The CD however, is beautiful and sounds divine. I jam very pleased with the CD and of course the prompt delivery."
1,It's done!!,"When I got this I thought it was a good deal. Now I am back looking for a new one. I used it for SKYPE phone calls. It was fine the first few months I got it. I take care of it, plus it was not my main headphone. I have a SONY that is great wished they also have one with a microphone.It worked great the volume control and the flexible wire of a mike it's easy to adjust but very easy to bend. After two months the sound went in the left ear not sure if it's because of the design or where the microphone is placed. Thought I would limp along since I didn't use it too often but I tried to adjust the thin microphone wire and it's coming apart. This is after 4 months of light use. I didn't drop it or used it too often just light use."
2,Better be able to memorize quickly,"This video has excellent potential, but unfortunately, I found it difficult to remember the moves. The problem is he teaches all the steps to the routine in one go, and then you dance it together. He doesn't teach a few steps and then go from the beginning and then add on some more and start from the beginning. You just learn some more and learn the next part and then learn the next part and then when you go to do it all together you have forgotten the first half."
4,Totally worth it,"This product was totally worth it. I've tried nearly everything to prevent seed messes on the floor but nothing has really worked. This product was great because it was thick enough so my birds didn't destroy it (like they did every other barrier) but thin enough to manipulate to fit the cage. The only thing I would suggest is buying multiple, one isn't enough. I bought three and put it all the way up near the top of the cage and I used packaging tape to seal the pieces together. But it does work and the price was way cheaper than I was expecting."
2,Not attaching well / not practical to clean.,I bought two of these seed guards hoping to use for two of my cages. They first look fine but the glue's for attaching them don't work so I had to replace them with regular tapes and the attract dirt... Needless to say it makes the cage look dirty and they will not be a good/practical option for cages. I am now going to give the acrylic sturdy ones a try were no taping is needed and they can be attached with fixtures.
4,A seminal classic,"This now obscure book conveyed and infused the seminal concepts that became known as ""Blitzkrieg"". No complete study of armored warfare would overlook this title. Very much recommended."
3,Good but not great,"I've had my binoculars for 5 days now, and I'm not all that impressed with them. Don't expect to be able to see anything when using more than about 25x magnification. I'm using my binoculars with a tripod, which is a MUST, but that doesn't help at all when the quality of the lenses don't seem to allow for focusing in the 25x or higher range. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any other binoculars out there with high magnification at a bareable price. If you can manage with the clear 16x-25x range, then they will probably be ok for you."
1,Probably the stupidest movie I have ever seen!,"I HATE this movie with every fiber of my being. I watched it with some friends that LOVE it and I almost had to disown them. I think the filter they used on this movie and Scanner Darkly is a STUPID GIMMIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you cant make an interesting movie don't try to cover it up with a stupid photoshop filter. For those of you who think it is ""animation"", your WRONG! It was filmed with real people then it had a filter applied to it (I work in the industry, trust me). Which makes it NOT animation. If I could give this movie negative stars I would. 1 star is VERY generous.This movie reminds me of when I was in high school and everyone was trying weed for the first time and every thing was just ""totally blowing their mind, man""You want some REAL philosophy? read PlatoIf you think this movie is DEEP, your stupid. Get educated.sorry"
3,This movey made me feel rill smart an' stuff,"Muh gurlfrend n I wur gon watch king of thuh hill, buhht then we sed lets go t'thuh vidio storr? We took this 'un, an' we feel reel smart an' all that bcuz we watcht it. If I gon to skool 'sted of bein tot at hom thun mabuh I'd unnerstan whut this moveys 'bout. Hunny, whurrd yu put thuh pork rines?"
5,Philosophy for the A.D.D. student,"Waking Life is a wonderful movie that makes you question the difference between your real-life, and the life in which you dream, and if you can really differentiate the two. It is filmed in a very interesting and transitory cartoonish style with a beautiful string soundtrack behind it. The film revolves around one young man as he travels throughout a dream stage, and learns little minute long philosophies along the way from his peers and his strangers. The more he learns, the more he understands where he really is, and the more confused he becomes. It's a wonderful movie to watch in a group, if only for the conversations that will spring from the very unique thoughts the movie brings up. Kierkeggard fans will be pleased too, existential philosophy ranks high in this dream world, as does a quasi-Biblical view of the book of Acts. Fun film!"
4,A Great Piece Of Work.,"This movie can be a barrage for the senses and can make you doubt what you might think is reality. I was moved greatly by this movie and I have loved ith from the first time that I saw it. Some of the theories in it may seem so far out there because you have never really thought about them that way before, but once they are presented to you they kinda make sense. If you like to think outside of the box then give this movie a shot and you won't be disappointed."
1,review waking life,"The movie did not reveal the truth. vety poor I thought. The author does not have a good understanding of light work and metaphysics, yet tries to come accross like he does. Actually I found alot of darkness in this moviethanks, Debbie"
4,"Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics,","Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics, objective human perception. if you liked 'what the bleep do we know?"" you'll probably like this movie. it's only about 85 min long, but the animated main characters encounters various people throughout his day and hears their perspectives on life (philosophers, an evolutionary biologist, young intellectuals etc.). the voices are from real interviews it sounds like and they're just placed in the movie to fit the flow...a unique movie that's worth watching. 4.2 stars. written review from a 34 yr old atheist."
4,"Excellent film, but not for everyone.","If you are the philosophical type, you will probably love this film. The loose story is brought together nicely by numerous vinettes of quircky actors, most of whom are simply playing themselves. I loved the film, but I could see that if you are the kind of person who wants action, characterization, or even a comprehensive story, you probably will not like it. The movie-making style and soundtrack are incredible, however. On the DVD, the live-action clips that they used to make the animation are really fun to watch as well."
3,Not his best,"Ray Bradbury was a science fiction icon, but there's a reason he didn't write ""The Playboy of the Western World"" or ""Finnegan's Wake."" The dialogue is all you get from this book. The rest of the book is a thin vehicle to get you from one conversation to the next. There are few descriptions and few insights. The dialogue itself is very humorous at parts, and in others it's obvious that this is Bradbury writing how the conversations should have gone, not how they really went. I've thoroughly enjoyed other works by Bradbury, but this wasn't one of them."
1,You're kidding right?,"Is this a joke? This is not Tidus's sword; not by a longshot. I think that fact is painfully obvious to anyone looking at that picture right there. I mean, just LOOK at how different they are!"
1,raziel,"I have a hard time believing they put much thought into this replica. Honestly, how hard is it to make the thing blue? Attention to detail, thats not too much to ask for is it?"
3,3rd Trilogy but only his Last Story Over the River -Flows like Vintage Galsworthy,"This is a review of the trilogy which is 2 stars but the 3rd story is Over the River - 4 stars and as good as any of the Forsyte Saga. I also prefer the 3rd story to his 2nd trilogy. Over the River is available by itself and only has one gag me with a spoon moment which is ""Dinny""s name . Once you get over thatsettle into Galsworthy's on the money UK 1930 life of the near rich in the UK Depression. His last work and history gave him amazingly relevant years to today to wind his life stories.Save the other two stories for snowstorms or your trips to the hospital. I am reading the 1934 US Charles Scribner edition from 1934 from my library and feel the tie to history when I open it up."
4,"forthcoming review in the NYTBR, February 18th","There is a very informative review by Suzannah Lessard in the February 18th issue of the New York Times Book Review. Not only does she provide interesting background to the issues surrounding urban growth in America, she also defines what these issues mean to us today, and the contribution this book makes to our understanding of the built world around us."
5,Great book on Eschatology,"I have this book. There are about 4 or 5 good books on Catholic Eschatology. That being said this is the King of them all and 'the authoritative reference' on Catholic Eschatology. Highly recommended and acclaimed on the back cover, foreward and many reviews.Done in an exceedingly scholarly way, everything referenced. This is a huge book at close to 600 pages. Provides hours of enraptured reading over and over again."
4,An excellent suplement!,"This book, like most in Hayashi's ""How to Draw Manga"" series, is a fabulous suplement to his introductory books. It's not meant to show every detail of drawing, as that's what the basic books are for. However, it does help clearly define the differences between the male and female figures, and goes into detail about male body structures, common design styles and builds.Excellent reference material, a must have for the anime/manga artist! I know I've inproved since getting it!"
1,not that great for price,not worth price with shipping doesn't help smell for any longer then anything I can get from dollar storethan you have a great day god bless
3,Over the top,"An amusing movie but a little over the top. James Garner is one of my favorites and he couldn't do much that I wouldn't like. This is about a retired Army man who purchases a Sherman tank to take with him because he always wanted one. What would you think if one of your neigbors pulled up in a Sherman tank and put it in his garage? To say nothing of your wife. Turns out, his son is arrested for something he didn't do and of course he has to rescue him. The tank and the people they meet along the way to his rescue are very interesting."
5,Excellent Framework,Provides an excellent framework for examining key characteristics of a healthy church. It can be used to frame an individual review of a pastor or for reflection on the effectiveness of one's church as a whole. Discusses societal trends and the need to adapt but remains anchored in the importantance of the church and the importance that it thrive.
5,As Stated,It's a cable that connects this HDMI doohickie to that HDMI doohickie each within about 25 yards of one another. Well informed on status via email and arrived in a timely manner.
2,Not water resistant at all,"This is a standard fuse holder, it is not water resistant. It has two rubber O-rings that help hold the end caps tight, but they do not keep water out of anything. There is nothing to keep water out of the fuse compartment or wire connections. It did not come with a fuse."
3,"Good Show, Bad DVD","I have loved the Cosby since its premier and was estatic when they released it to DVD. The first two season's releases were exceptional. The third and fourth, save for the shows themselves, leave little to be desired.I could care less about the packaging, but Menu options such as Play All are necessary when multiple episodes are involved. I like the slim packaging.Remember, you get what you pay for.... these releases were priced considerably less than the first two."
3,not bad,what I love about this is that you can turn you v finder around to take pics of yourself and ee them before you shoot. the pics though are not to good
1,THIS DOLL IS AWFUL,I GOT MY FRIEND THIS DOLL FOR CHRISTMAS AND IT STINKS AFTER MY FRIEND TOOK THE BRATZ OUT OF THE BOX AND I CHECKED OUT HER HAIR IT WAS AWFUL IT WAS ALL CRUMBLED UP...! IT MADE ME WANNA JUMP OUTTA MY SKIN I HATE THIS DOLL.AND HER SHOES AND SKIRT ARE HIDEOUS (TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T HAVE BIGGER LETTERS TO WRITE IN SO I CAN EXPRESS HOW I REAAALLY FEEL)
4,Through the Fire,"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Chaka who is already a musical legend keeps it real from beginning to end. She is a strong woman, who should be celebrated for being a survivor."
5,What a saw!,"I actually picked one of these saws up at an auction as my first table saw and didn't realize the quality of the saw until I went shopping for a new band saw. While at the local Grizzly outlet, I stopped to take a look at their table saws and quickly came to realize some definite advantages in the Jet.The fence on this saw is considerably better than any of the other factory fences I have seen, and it seems to be quite durable. (Mine was purchased by the original owner in 1992!) The saw is basically built like a tank, so make sure you have help if you want to move it much!!!I'm now within another week of getting my new bandsaw and if the table saw is any indication, I can't wait to see what the Jet bandsaw is like!"
3,"Great Saw Overall, but Entry Level Fence is Garbage","Smooth & quiet compared to the jobsite saws. Nice induction motor, sturdy stand with nice thick paint. The painted sheet steel wings are just as usable as the cast iron ones, so don't spend your money there. Spend your money on a better fence. This fence has a super-duper lock in the front, but a cheezy little one in the back. Not good when you need to push heavy pieces of wood against it. Basically, everything is good about this except the fence, but since the fence is the most important part of a table saw, I had to knock it down by two stars."
3,Dissapointing,The topic is compelling; the writing and acting are not. The psycological analyses are problematic. Serious subject could have used a more serious analysis.
4,Griffin House Album,This is a pretty decent album from a band that I found on a mix-CD. Sort of mellow with interesting lyrics.
5,Saw Griffin in Concert ~ Fantastic!,"I had the pleasure of seeing Griffin House in concert; he opened for John Mellencamp. He was absolutely fantastic! His voice, lyrics, and guitar definitely touch your soul. He has a sincere, honest style that I liked immediately. He will definitely continue with success. If you have the chance to see him live- do not miss it! Great new artist!"
4,great new artist,"Amsterdam is one of those atmospheric pieces of music that evokes those moments when we lost something unrecoverable. it is a good beginning to an album by a songwriter with the ability to describe emotions without sappiness. He has an elastic voice and no reluctance to stretch it around unsentimental lyrics. And, let's not forget great guitar work. Loved it."
4,Wonderful version of Bach's Harpsichord Concertrii,"Having experienced in person the performances of Bach's Branderburg Concertii in person by the Bach American Soloists, I knew I wanted to hear their conductor Jeffrey Thomas' renditon. In a word: wonderful. The sound is crisp and their rendition is fast and lively as always, without being ""too heavy"" as one of the complaints my sister shares for not liking Bach and preferring Chopin...Whatever!! The only fault I could find with the recording is that the otherwise strong & brassy sounding Mietke harpsichord is a single manual instrument and there are at times a certain ""monotony"" to the dynamics of the movement (specially noticiable in the D minor Concerto). That's the only reason I gave it a 4 star review. One, however, cannot go wrong with the purchase of this disc."
4,Ex-Soda Stereo Goes Symphonic,"Gustavo Cerati was part of Argentina's Soda Stereo, one of the most popular and forward-looking pop-rock ensembles in Latin rock. Cerati's silky tenor has been featured in four excellent pop albums recorded since the demise of SS during the 90's (""Bocanada"", ""Amor Amarillo"", ""Siempre es Hoy"", and his superb collaboration with Daniel Melero, ""Colores Santos""). This DVD serves as a souvenir of Cerati's artistic engagement along with a symphonic orchestra, reprising a well-thought out selection of songs from his solo career as well as some Soda favorites. Standout arrangements include ""Un Millón de Años Luz"" and the opening salvo, ""Canción Animal"". Although the shot-on-video direction lacks in imagination, the sound, mixed in 5.1 surround, is superb, placing the listener right in the director's position. You cannot go wrong with this title, which avoids the muzak direction and rearranges the songs as true symphonic pieces. Close to a masterpiece..."
5,A TRUE MASTERPIECE,"i have followed Gustavo's music since he was in Soda Stereo and this DVD shows how great his music really is. He is a great singer and performer this DVD truly shows that, I highly recommend this DVD, this DVD IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE !!!"
1,SUPA..WACK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All i Have to say is Beats,Beats,Beats Fraiser boy sound like a wanna be Playa Fly."
3,Subpar for Vangelis,"Vangelis once said -- at least once -- that only a tiny fraction of his music was ever released, and that some years he could release 10-20 albums if everything he did were to be released onto the commercial market. Then it would seem that the year The City was made was a bad year for him. It is well below average by Vangelis standards and just average on an absolute scale. It has its moments, but it's disappointing overall. Look elsewhere for excellent work from this brilliant artist. There are dozens of better choices than The City."
3,"Not even close to ""Blade Runner""","In many of the reviews before mine, I have noticed many customers have compared ""The City"" to ""Blade Runner."" You cannot compare them. Although this disc does contain some decent tracks, it lacks the soul, originality and emotion of ""Blade Runner."" ""Dawn"" is perhaps the most Blade Runnerish track on the disc due to its etherial feel. However, ""Nerve Center"" is one of Vangelis' most irritating compositions as of yet. In any case this CD is worth owning for such tracks as ""Dawn"" and ""Twilight,"" but is nowhere near as good as ""Blade Runner."""
2,He could have done better!,"Vangelis's music sounds unceartain of itself, for it changes its style in nearly every song. Although change is not always bad, this change in Vangelis's music is unwanted. He relies, too heavilly, on rhythyms that seem more appropriate for rock albums, and the rest of his music fails to create any beautiful themes. Instead of his simplistic, beautiful rhythms, he offers nothing memorable and I am sure that this album will be forgotten."
5,"Great,Great,Great","This is truely a great film. The other reviews all tell you it's about abunch of guy's who were drafted and get ready to go to war. Well it is about that but what I got from this film is a story about friendship, about two guy's who don't have anybody and they find each other and form a brotherhood. The movie is so good and the look of the movie is raw and real and it is written so well. The only thing I didnt like was the ending cause it's so real, I think everyone can relate to the ending cause we've all had that friend."
1,THE TIGER EATING HIS TAIL!!,"I kept waiting and waiting and waiting, for a tag line to appear or even a character build up. Something!! Jeeeeezzze, what a flop.The only interest here was the pseudo-homosexual overtones of men at war and that was not developed. No wonder I hated that Bat Man movie this guy Directed.At no time was this movie believable.Colin Farrell, prances around like some 'boot-camp-guru',helping guys get out of the service, and although his acting, along with his friend, Matthew Davis, was good, we have to grasp at straws to bring any sense to it all... I gave it a *. Yes one (*)The ending you've seen a thousand times, but mostly its a man and a woman in the crying scene. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against homosexuality in movies, but this movie left us flat on both fronts.This refers to the theatrical release, not the DVD.ciao yaaah69"
4,Ever wonder about basic training,"If you ever wondered if you could get through basic traing, watch this movie. Well done, well acted, and well produced movie. 75% of the reviews agree with my 4 star rating, the others...????I was 1 inch away from experiencing this, and I still don't know how well I would have fared.I'll keep this disc for a second look about a year from now."
3,Well Made Military Training Movie,"It's about soldiers being being given advanced infantry training in the U.S. before being shipped to Vietnam. Some are draftees, some enlisted. The lead character, Boz, wants to be a human being.The whole movie takes place in the U.S.It's about how the soldiers are abused and what they did to get out of the Army. Very intense and entertaining. I didn't like the ending. A good study of what happens to normal people undeer extreme stress. Also a good thermometer of attitudes and moral (bad) in the army during the Vietnam war era.I'm tempted to say that, overall, the plot lacks credibility, ...The actors and characters were all very intriguing."
1,this is terrible,tigerland is the worst of the genre i have seen...a waste of hard earned money and an insult to the the men and women who serve and train the united states army...it uses only the worst the worst of cliches...there is no substance...realtiy has left the building in this one...this is not how soldiers trained for viet nam...the setting at ft. polk with the rain and mud is the only thing well portrayed...save your money...vince.
5,Amazingly accurate,"This movie captures the essence of the early 70s US Army, losing a war and its sense of direction. The characters are all too real and the cinematography perfectly captures the mood. I remember many people just like the ones in the movie. Remember the young recruit who ""went almost through 6th grade, married a woman a might older, 28 to 17, and had a few kids, some mine, some hers""? That was no exaggeration, I ran into many of those people.Tigerland shows how good a low budget movie can be."
1,I never received this item; I got the wrong item -- twice!!,"The item shown in the picture is the one I ordered and I did not get it :identified as ASIN:B000059TS4--- Item Model #625133,these blank CD's are used only for AUDIO equipment.Unfortunately the item I got TWICE were the ones that are used for Computer Drives and audio equipment ( CDR-80MU/10 ),with a DIFFERENT picture in the package so I returned them.As far as review,I have used in the past many Maxell blank CD's like the ones I did not received and never had any problems with them. They are outstanding -- if you can get them."
3,Good questions for PmBok,"Nice book to grasp and understand Pmbok guide, but in order for me to actually get the PMP certification, I used these questions, PmBok guide and Rita's book. Quality of the questions is really basic in this book, which is good to understand the PGs and KAPs but for PMP exam they need to add another 500 scenarios based questions."
4,PMP Exam Prep,"The PMP Exam Practice Questions and Solutions was a very big help to me. I credit part of my ability to pass the exam on the first attempt to this study guide. The explaination of why the correct answer was the best selection helped me identify areas in the PMBOK and other materials that I needed to concentrate on. This book alone is not enough to prepare for the exam, but is it is a very good selection in a suite of study materials."
5,You'll laugh! You'll cry! You'll sit for the MBE!,"This novel was a great, feel-good read that's sadly not seen in this genre that often. The madcap adventures of Gordy and his cohorts will bring you back to your Scooby Doo days (er, that is, if you ever watched it in the first place...). What's more, you'll actually LEARN something about criminal law and the court system. How often do you get that out of a ""legal"" thriller?? And I'll bet my law school loan that you can't read this book without humming a tune 'bout a certain spot north of Havana!"
3,Not An Official Release,"This EP was not something that was approved by Laura before her death and the songs on this CD are not the finished versions she intended to release according to her official website. The official release of her final material is still in the works. I'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this CD, that's a personal choice. However as a fan, this is something I would like to know so I thought I'd make sure to post this. I am required to rate the item to post a review so I gave it 3 stars because I HAD to rate it."
3,Python II,"I really loved Python 1 after I bought it, so I ordered Python II off of amazon and it was great! It's not as entertaining and definetly not as funny as the first Python, but it's still fun to watch. Greg Larson(William ""Billy"" Zabka) returns in Python II as Agent Larson on a mission to capture another large snake that has again escaped due to an airplane crash. This time around the battle rages on in Russia. I wish there were some more special features on this disk, a commentary would be cool."
5,A true metal masterpiece,"This is Redemption's second album, and the first with Ray Alder(Fates Warning)on the vocals, an amazing improvement on their debut album. Is one of the best metal album I have ever listen to. An absolute solid sound and performance,is truly beyond words, buy it right now, you will not be dissapointed one bit."
4,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * * *,Who would like this? : everyone except grandmaWorth seeing...-in the theatre: Yes-buy it : Yes* my only complaint is a slight overuse of product advertising/placement but do not miss this!
4,Pretty entertaining,"Hey, as long as I can sit through a movie without falling asleep it's good enough for me. Great visuals, engaging story. Acting was pretty good, although I must say that Colin Farell puts Tom Cruise to shame!"
4,Pure sci-fi,"Well, it's one of the best sci-fi movies of the past years and Spielberg redeemed himself after A.I.. The story is good, photography is really neat, and the film just grasps you attention. If you're a sci-fi fan this is a must have."
1,Horrible Cover,I'm a graphic designer and I know horrible art when I see it. That doesn't even resemble Tom Cruise either.
2,"Drink Pepsi, dress in GAP and live the future","Finally I gave into al the hype and actually went to watch Minority Report. The question I'm left with now that I have seen it is: what was all the hype about?Although I have to admit that some of the computer generated special effects were impressive the acting lacked any kind of substance.However, what annoyed me the most was the incredible amount of product placement throughout the movie. Wasn't Mr. Spielberg sure if he would make enough money at the box office that he had to advertise Aquafina, Pepsi, Gap, Lexus, and Nokia throughout the movie?Overall I spent two and a half hours in the movie during which I asked myself more than once if all the people that walked around in the movie theater during the showing of the movie, just as bored as I was? The bottom line is, good special effects for free and a few interesting scenes like the chase in the car factory, other than that I can watch commercials at home on my TV for free."
4,Awesome!,"This is a great movie! I'm impressed, not only is this movie action packed, but it has a well developed plot. This movie presents an interesting vision of the future.Tom Cruise has another strong performance, but he's not the only good actor in the movie. Good character interaction and great special effects make this movie very engaging and fun to watch.I would say that this movie is a must see, must own."
3,Weird,"This movie would have been great if Stephen Spielberg wouldn't have tried so much weird stuff. Some of the movie is in Black and White, some isn't. Some action scenes are filmed by someone running with a camera which makes it nearly impossible to focus on whats going on and took me totally out of the movie.This movie should also be rated R. Numerous murder scenes shown throughout the movie, eyeballs being taken out of peoples head and carried in ziploc bags, and multiple sex (not love) scenes carry this movie, in my mind, past the PG-13 marker.Still for the two hours of the movie that were entertaining I give this movie three stars."
3,"""MINORITY REPORT"" A VISUALLY STUNNING, BUT UNEVEN WORK","Spielberg has really lost his touch. This film could have been directed by anyone. ""Minority Report"" is visually stunning, mildly intriguing, but just too episodic and overlong by about 50 or so minutes. The film climaxes in several places and really has a good pace up to the part where Cruise gets his eyes replaced. Cruise is his regular self, albeit without the killer smile, but there are plenty of scenes of him grimacing and looking stressed as only HE can. ""The Matrix"" and ""Logan's Run"" tell similar stories with much more panache."
2,Dissapointing,"A Steven Spielberg sci fi film starring Tom Cruise can create a lot of hype and expectations and unfortunately this film fails to live up to them. The film's first twenty minutes are compelling but once Cruise has to go on the run the film falls apart. The action scenes in this movie are laughable and their is far too much CGI. The process of how the precogs determine the future is not explained well enough either. Spielberg last great film was Jurassic Park and he has been slipping ever since, by focusing too much on effects and not on relatable charachters or compelling story."
4,Worth Seeing,"I won't give away any spoilers. The previews tell you Cruise is part of a police force that catches murderers before they do the deed, but now they're after him (sorta like The Fugitive ""I didn't do it!""). So will he or won't he? Go find out. The special effects are excellent. The action is pretty good. And you can forgive Cruise for not figuring it out earlier because he has a lot on his mind. I would go see it again and that's my formula for a good movie."
2,This film made me sleepy,"Minority Report was produced by Dreamworks SKG, which is run by the three most powerful men in Hollywood (Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen), and it has a very over-rated but somehow extremely popular movie star in it (Tom Cruise) so you would think it would be a big-budget blockbuster, but this is not the case at all. In Minority Report, We are expected to believe that Washington DC in the year 2054 is a very clean and sterile metropolis, with no run-down buildings or graffiti on the walls. Precrime, the department that uses genetically-gifted ""Pre-cogs"" is entrusted with arresting murderers before they kill. The pre-cogs look like every other alien in Spielberg's movies (most noteably AI), and Tom Cruise is always shown running around with very little meaning or purpose to his actions. The ending was weak and predictable, and it was WAY too long, considering it was a very mediocre movie"
3,Fluffity Fluff Fluff Fluff,"Only three things were fabulous about this film: 1) The curious and fascinating concept of ""precrime"" and the prevention as a moral issue 2) The computer graphics of a futuristic highway 3) Tom Cruise's maintainance of his hotness. The direction wasn't really flawed so much as there was no story to care about. A couple scenes showed real promise, but all in all...the plot was The Fugitive, minus Tommy Lee Jones's wacky presence."
1,Unlogical,If Steven Spielberg is going to make a movie about how the in both directions infinite timeline punishes murderers he should also include those who are responsable for poverty.
5,So good,"Yes, the movie's a little long, but it's been a while since I've seen a sci-fi futuristic movie that kept me guessing for so long. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever, but if you're looking for a way to pass a lazy evening, this'll keep you way happy. There's enough plot twists and action scenes to keep anyone happy."
3,Disappointing Picture Quality But Still Nice =),"When i saw the picture quality of the DVD of the movie itself, i thought that the DVD i bought was fake! but no it can't be because i bought it from an authorized dealer... But when i saw some of the comments about the quality too, i knew i bought the right one! good enough for me! hehe! But the story was really fantastic! especially the twist! Very unpredictable twist! Very nice! But i was still hoping they would release a better version of the picture quality ( a Superbit maybe) for this."
3,Good movie.....bad-quality DVD,"I agree with most of the other people who rated the content of this movie. It is a great movie, and I have it on DVD. However, the DVD quality is sub-par, especially by today's standards. This DVD looks about as grainy as DVD's you'll see of movies released ten years ago. I am not exaggerating here...and what is even more amazing is that the actual movie section of the DVD is 5.54GB, which is more than enough for excellent quality. I assume that the original filming of this movie was not all that great, although it looked fine in theaters. Oh well...I would give the DVD 5 stars if it wasn't for its poor quality."
3,"The future is here, and it's mixed!","Good premise, future precrime. Cruise does an admirable job.Speilberg borrowed some Stanley Kubrick cinema tricks here, including the eye removal scenes (Clockwork Orange), classical music as Cruise does the pre-crime search (Space 2001), etc etc.But Ending got a bit messy, instead of making the moral issues of pre-crime front and center, movie became more of a cat and mouse game, of whodunit. Speilberg could have made a BIG statement here, having set up the premise, and creating the wonderful set pieces, giving viewer a glimpse of the future, etc, etc. but unfortunately, he opted for a cat and mouse chase game Hitchcock style.In the end, movie was visually great, acting or story telling super until the story started to divert to mystery detective story which left the viewer short."
2,"""halo"" me now...","Goodness! They actually made a DVD out of this?! The movie is only good the first time around. If you haven't seen this on the big screen, then get this, but don't expect to watch this more than once... it's very boring. The action scenes are NICE, and so is the story and computer graphics. And Tom's acting leaves a lot to be desired. Since ol' Steven made this, I thought it was OKAY, but the ending is really GOOD, the first time around. Watching it again made the movie boring since you can see everything that led to the impressionable ending of this movie. All in all, this movie is less than OKAY. If you don't believe me, go buy it and waste $22 bucks... lets see, what could I have done with my $22?"
4,Well Made,Watched the movie resently. The theme is very futuristic and it keeps you in suspence. The movie is better than Tom's Vanila Sky where at the end you still don't know what is going on and you have to guess your own ending. The special effects are well edited and 'clean'.
4,Good SciFi film that falls short of greatness...,"This is a very entertaining DVD with lots of cool features to enjoy. Spielberg really is the grand master of film in the modern age.Unfortunately he is NOT philosophically consistent with the granduer he is able to present on the screen. This movie had the potential to deal with some fascinating topics relating to freewill vs. fate or destiny. It would have been bad enough if Spielberg had addressed the issue and come down on the wrong side of reality - but he doesn't even make a clear-cut stand with the plot resolution he gives. So at the end I was left feeling thrilled by the action and great special affects, but unaffected by the lack of real substance.It will be a great day for film history if Spielberg ever gets his philosophy in tune with his sense of life.Meanwhile, this is an enjoyable ride as long as you don't mind being left in the middle of nowhere at the end."
4,A report to keep you in constant suspense,This Sci-fi Mystery/Action film is a remake that could be done by no other than Speilburg himself. This helped to reintrouduce a movie that was once popular in the 70's to a younger generation such as myself with a few added twists and plots. Tom Cruise did a very good job playing this role and making it exactly what it should be. The plot and action was very well done and the whole concept of stoping future crimes and events just play with your thoughts a bit about the real future and where we will be. I got the Dvd as a gift but I would have no regrets buying it. Anyone still haing doubts should rent it and see but no need for extra hassle ........Just get it!
1,Disc doesn't work,"The bonus disc will play immediately, but the feature movie disc won't play at all. I didn't realize this until I couldn't return it. What a waste."
5,Great Movie,"Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Spielberg movies. But this one really made a favorable impression on me. The futuristic plot and very cool gadgets make this movie worth you're while."
2,Very dull and predictable,"This was a highly anticipated movie for me turned out to be very very dull and very very predictable. Very much along a typical Spielberg's recipy: great idea converted to be available for any type of customers, a perfect mediocricity. Nothing exciting. Not to mention this very grainy filming techique which makes it unpleasant to watch."
3,"Good visual, intelligent action movie","After the obnoxious MI 2, Tom Cruise decided to work with a much better director than Jon Woo!! Enter Mr. Steven Spielberg,the master.The movie is very good, fast paced and, more important, INTELLIGENT. It's not ultra-violent, much on teh contrary. It builds its momentum to a climax.I enjoyed it a lot."
5,awesome finish,"Movie gets better everytime I watch it! The best part is the first half of the movie is good, but the second half blows you away."
4,Engaging,"This movie has all the makings of a classic. Great Sci-Fi with a turn the tables story that is compelling and engaging. Just enough in the way of special effects as to not detract from the story but to convey a future of both optimism and the terror associated with too much trust in technology and human institutions.In all, great storytelling!"
2,"Way Too Overrated, Among Other Things","Way too long, way too blue, way too nothing like the original Philip Dick story (far superior), way too formula Hollywood, way too much crap. Two stars for a couple interesting visuals, but that's about it. If you want Philip Dick done right, go Blade Runner, go Screamers, and then go Total Recall (yes, big budet Hollywood action, but it still retains a good Philip Dick core). Minority Report just sucked."
2,"Outstandingly Simple-Minded, Stentorian Trash . . .","IN A WORLD . . .Where everyone ORATES and no one can speak,And everything happens at a Funky, Disco Beat . . .A film made for an audience not sufficiently clever to enjoy genuine science . . (omit that last sentence) . . A film of which the 2nd highest critical compliment is ""neat"" and the better-valued compliment is designated principally by VOLUME: ""NEAT!""A loud, neat distraction during a physical assault."
3,It's cold out in space,"Here's the formula for Minority Report. Take the sad, frigid ambiance that permeated Spielberg's last flop, A.I. Add a ""name"" lead actor, Tom Cruise. Blend in a little action, not too much though. Borrow photographic techniques from highbrow horror films: shoot in chilly blue and white hues, blur the focus a bit. Shock the viewers with plenty of lurid clips suggestive of snuff videos. Finally, to keep the audience grounded, throw in some elements the masses can relate to: moralizing against technology, plus a whodunit plot twist.The end result is an intelligent movie, very much in Stanley Kubrick style, but lacking the grandiose vision of Kubrick. What's left is a depressing, creepy, brutal, ultimately sad and very very lonely experience. The darker side of Spielberg is shining through in full force. Like a diamond lost in space, its light is cold and lifeless."
1,Wierd,"Had to review this for German Class. Apparently the film won no awards and I can see why. Very strange, unconnected, disjointed movie that depends on the viewer's imagination to connect the dots, but the dots just aren't there. I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,With a Song in My Heart - The Jane Froman Story,"This DVD would not play on our 'Australian region only' new Sony Blue Ray Player or our multi region Toshiba DVD player but would only play on our all in one Vivid TV (LED Flat Screen with internal DVD player by Aldi a European brand).It is a lovely story with beautiful costumes, Susan Hayward was fabulous."
4,It's about time!,"All Jane Froman fans have been waiting for this film to be made available,a well done film being released in time for her 100th birthday. If you're a Susan Hayward fan, you'll love her playing Jane. She's FAb. If it's Jane's story you're after, I think it's pretty accurate. There's a book coming out soon by Barbara Seuling. SAY IT WITH MUSIC: The Life and Legacy of Jane Froman. I KNOW that that is accurate."
3,No Texture,Note that the PG-26 doesn't have the texture on the front to match the feel of the firearm grip like the other Pearce grips. I overlooked this and was quite disappointed as that's a major selling point to the Pearce grips.
1,Leo should have Sank with the shark like in Titanic,I saw this movie in the tropical Cancun and even with Spanish subtitles I was dissapointed. Now the Dvd did it little more justice. The truth is the movie had an amazing backdrop and a sound score to match but like many of Leo's movies the script and plot were lacking in every major area. If the script had been as well constructed as that island was beautiful this movie could have taking more awards than I can count. I personally think Leo is has bit of inate talent but if he continues to take scripts and movies directed like this he wont be able to act himself out of a wet paper bag.
1,PRETENTIOUS,"What a waste of time! Was everyone involved in making this movie stoned? How dare some compare this with the Lord of the Flies! And what's this thing about parallel universe...? oh, ppppulleease! I haven't even read the book but the movie comes to me as abysmal already. Even the performances which could have been the film's saving grace is sophomoric."
5,Too easy to disregard,"It is so easy to dog this film because it has Leonardo in it and after the Titanic spawned Leo Mania, it seems that most people will write off any project that involves him as simple bubble gum. Thats sad because this is a really good film. Anyone that has done the travel thing and lost themselves trying to find something that they can call their own can feel the message of the film. Most of the criticism is aimed at the plot or lack there of. Nonsense, this has far more plot than most of the dribble we are fed. I think that the plot is rather sublte in that it explores who we are when we are far from home and how we interact with others while trying to figure out our own role. The visual aspects of the film cant be knocked as they are truly stunning, Breath taking, and mind blowing. The soundtrack is pretty cool as well."
2,??????????????????,"Does dicaprio want to just eliminate all of his fricking fans by taking part in junk like this? this movie could have been good actually great but it comes to dead hault when you start to like it and the film makers basically spit in your face for doing so. things get so boring they thought ,ohh hell lets through in a few shark attacks and that will generate suspense.one great thing about it is it looks fantastic! but it still blows in the end."
3,Good!,good effort here. It's an interesting view of a uptopian effort and how it can go seriously wrong.
2,Pretty pointless...but the trees looked good!,"For the most part, this movie was pretty pointless. The scenery looked very gorgeous, but as for a script...well, there was none! In short, we see three people go to an island that is supposedly hidden from society, and there they find about 50 other people. (Which doesn't make much sense in the first place, because we never really find out how any of the other people got there, since there aren't supposed to be any ""maps"" in the outside world.) Anyways, a bunch of non-coherent events happen, including Leonardo DiCaprio going mad. All in all, ""The Beach"" is a mess which was not very entertaining.By the way, I read in another review that this movie should not be compared to ""Lord of the Rings"". While I think ""The Beach"" cannot even compare, the settings and overall subject matter are quite similar."
3,Read the book,"The Beach, directed by Danny Boyle and based on the book written by Alex Garland, is one of the most dissapointing movies I have ever seen. I have read the book three different times, and the movie does this novel no justice. I love Danny Boyle as a director, and to his credit, the cinematography, music, and style of this film is great. However, the character development, symbolism, and much of the scenes in the book do not come across in the movie. As usual, the book is better than the movie, and this movie is worse than most."
4,The Beach- a masterpiece in disguise,"I found the beach to be excellent viewing, when you hear many negative things about a film, you are inquisitive to find out for yourself. Whilst watching the film i noticed how the storyline became more and more interesting, i didn't, at any point want to stop watching the film. It mixes small traces of city life, with the reality of being on a desert island. Intelligent script writing and talented acting produced an excellent film, with depth, that i personally feel is very underrated."
3,"Not a day at ""The Beach""","I am fortunate enough to have seen this movie on DVD. Let's face it, as you can tell from the other reviews, this movie does not live up to expectations, to DiCaprio's previous flicks, or to the beautiful scenery. The saving grace, for me, was that the DVD had many features that made up for the movie. A suggestion to those watching this movie... make good use of the cut scenes. These scenes did several things for me: 1) Fill in the blanks for several huge, gaping plot holes 2)Make me wonder what the heck the director was thinking when he throw away several crucial and interesting scenes and left in ones like that um...interesting video game-esque scene. If you must buy this movie, buy the DVD and enjoy everything else on it."
3,Bad Reviews????,"Yes...you did hear Leonardo Dicaprio, but does this one measure up to Titanic? Not so much. When I saw The Beach I had heard horrible reviews about it, but I watched it anyway. And surprise, I actually thought it was a decent movie. It kept me interested only until about the end where they failed miserably. (then again the endings these days aren't usually good) Watch it with an open mind and I think you'll enjoy it. Cheers!"
2,The Beach Review.,"When I bought this DVD I was so excited because I hadn't seen it for years. But when it finally came in the mail, I was disappointed. It was very scratched up. When I watched it, it skipped some parts and had to pause and play several times to get it to play correctly. But it's okay, it was only $3!"
2,the big yawn,"I can see that others raved about this movie, but I found it hard to sit through. I am not criticizing the performances, but my question is: what is the point of this movie? Whose fault IS it that Justine's life is so dull? I can't see how it's anybody's fault but hers. I kept wanting her to DO something: go to school, take classes, become a carpenter, a chef, a real estate agent, a gardener, an artist, ANYTHING. She seems just empty. She's bored with her husband because he smokes pot and watches inane TV, but she isn't any better. Hard to feel sympathetic. And the movie was just as boring. At one point I thought it would turn into a real black comedy, but it retreated to just dull."
4,Could've been Better,This movie was well acted with great characters. The movie isn't quite original in the fact that thses people are so ordinary..which makes it good. You should realize that these characters being the typical run of the mill makes it more believable. This story could happen to anyone in that situation. In the ways it could be better are that there are certain scenes in the movie that seem out of place or don't quite make sense. The ending is quite predictable..to break the stereotpye the ending should have been completely different.
3,Portrait of a downward spiral,"Jennifer Aniston, as Justine, has always been a ""good"" girl and all it has gotten her is a mismatched husband who doesn't ""get"" her and a deadend job. She is fed up with her life and is vulnerable to the attentions of a younger man who is a co-worker. She finds him much deeper and more interesting than her husband and enjoys hearing him compare himself to Holden Caulfield in ""Catcher in the Rye"". The attraction blossoms into an affair which leads to further complications in her life. Soon things are out of control and she continues to lie to cover up what she has done. All around her, people's lives are crashing and she seems oblivious to it all, still concerned about her own self-interests. The performances are good, but sometimes the humorous scenes clash a bit with the seriousness of the rest of the film. The ending to this one is NOT predictable and the viewer is left to wonder until the end."
3,Jennifer prooves her worth,"If youre looking for a friends kind of movie then dont get this one, rent Picture Perfect or just Friends.This is a movie that is all about the acting. I knew Jake could do it cause he played a similar character in Donnie Darko but i was not sure Jennifer could do it. But Jennifer surely prooved her worth and she got rid of the Rachel image right away.I belived the characters in the film and that matters a lot.This movie is wery tragic but still wery happy at times. The plot is good and the ending was surprising."
3,What is the song?,"...P>A movie with a moral. Don't be a thief and don't be disturbed.Oh and for the record this is not an ""indie"" film, it's a low budget film that was released by 20th Century Fox. Big difference."
2,What's The Big Deal?,"I don't get it. What's all the buzz really about? That Jennifer Aniston can play something other than her ""Friends"" role? Cmon! Aniston plays Justine, a depressed check out girl at a small town retail store who longs for something more. She meets Holden, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a much younger, new employee and has an affair with him. The skinny: he falls in love, becomes obsessed, gets her pregnant, robs the retail store and then......I won't blow the ending. Did I mention she was married to John C Reilly? Anyway, she tells him the baby is his and they live happily ever after in Normalsville. The story drags, though there is a very suspenseful pivotal moment for her (at a stoplight), but overall the film falls flat. Good Girl is nothing to run out to so save your pennies for the DVD rental. **1/2"
1,"Awful, stupid, boring",This movie made me thinking about how needy Jennifer Aniston and others in this movie should be to participate in something like this. Worst movie I've seen for the last two or three years. Feel robbed by both time and money. Do NOT recommend to anyone.
4,Great Film but Texas Flag Gaffe,"I thought Jennifer Aniston was wonderful in this film and it was very touching, though a bit easy to predict. The only gaffe was that the Texas flag is prominantly displayed in one scene UPSIDE DOWN! Apalling for those of us from the Lone Star State!"
1,Complete waste of time!,"The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a ""Forrest Gump"" imitation. Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era....."
1,Who cares?,"Nothing about any of the characters in this film made me care what happened to any of them or why. Aniston is as flat and two-dimensional as she is in Friends, and her ""Texas"" accent was halfhearted at best. The only worthwhile acting job in this boring hour and a half was done by the actor who played Bubba to comic perfection, even though the character's justifications for his actions were a stretch. I sat it out, waiting and waiting for something in this film that lived up to the positive reviews, but came up with nothing. It was nothing about nothing."
1,WIERD!,"I was watching this with my parents (im 12) until they made me leave the room do to a very detailed and graphic sex scene in which Justine has with Holden at a hotel.I could hear it though. Why do they have to make sex scences so detailed?? There was also another sex scene in which Justine has with Buba, her husbands best friend. You also see Bubas balls. Ewww..."
1,Don't waste your time,"I can't believe Jennifer Aniston was in this movie. I have really enjoyed all of her previous movies. I guess she was trying to break the good girl persona. It was awful. After watching, I thought to myself, why??? I could have done so much more with my 2 hours."
1,Save your time,"Save your time, save your money. This movie is horrible. I got this for my wife, thinking it was a movie she would enjoy more than me, but she didn't like it one bit either. Although the movie was only 90+ minutes, it seemed like 2.5 hours. Where is the Zero star rating, one star is too high."
2,didn't like this at all,"I didn't like 'the good girl' - it should have been titled, 'i use people for my own good.' Justine makes Tom/Holden think she's in love with him and wants to be with him and then suddenly decides she wants to go back to her husband. She knew up front Holden was disturbed and only pushed him over the edge anyway. She won in the end with the baby and her husband's forgiveness.I only like some of the references and/or similarities to ""Catcher in the Rye"" and the movie felt a lot like the Cohen brothers film (which I love), but overall I was disappointed with it. Glad it was on TV for free."
1,"""The Best Movie Of The Year"" Gone Wrong","I bought this movie expecting to have a great time watching it. The reviews plastered on the front cover rave about it, so I expected a great film. What I got was the complete opposite. This movie appalled me. The fact that it was called ""The Best Movie Of The Year"" just goes to show that some of the movie critics have no idea what they are talking about. The accents were insulting and the plot line took unnecessary turns that were, at their best, grotesque. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and if, for some twisted reason, you're looking for a copy of it on DVD, you can have mine."
2,"""Good Girl"" Makes For BAD MOVIE! Not Worth Rental Price","Come on people! Sure there are a few good moments, and I am not one to necessarily criticize offbeat comedies; however, this is just a lousy movie overall. If you want to see a film that is consistently funny with a decently written script and that has Jennifer Aniston in it, see ""Office Space."" Jennifer's acting is impressive enough in ""Good Girl,"" but the slow pace and sloppiness just makes me wish I had spent the last hour and a half, using my mind in a more productive way than this seeing this trite movie about basically uninteresting people making poor decisions with their lives. ""One Hour Photo"" uses characters working in a mega shopping center but unlike ""Good Girl"" has a better script. I felt like I was teased along for an unsatisfying ending in this sappy little movie."
1,Dullest Movie Ever,"I am a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, however I have seen her in better scripts. Her performance was good for what the film was. I personally did not enjoy the story line. Normally I watch a film to escape and feel good, as you do with a good book. But, this movie bored and depressed me. Anytime someone dies in the end it makes you wonder what was the point of spending two hours of my life to watch a film."
1,How is boredom entertaining?!?,"With all the buzz, I was anxious to see this movie. But, wow, was I disappointed.A woman bored with her hateful life meets a boy bored with his hateful life and they have an affair. THe movie was as boring as their lives.I hope this wasn't Jennifer Aniston's breakout role because I think she's capable of so much. Thoe role only gave her a chance to express the boredom she probably felt making this movie."
4,Don't know!,"I never received this item. Although I ordered it & reordered it. I waited over 6 weeks & finally canceled the order. I was told that it was ""lost in the mail & that replacement would be expedited."" 3 weeks later, I still hadn't seen the movie. I was very disappointed since I have never had bad service with Amazon. This time I was extremely disappointed. I still don't have this movie."
5,enjoyed it,"I enjoyed this book. It is not meant to be a history of film, but rather, as the title implies, a close look at Black representations in popular film. Guerrero can give the reader some refreshing looks on films we all know and may love, and the reader will gain a more critical eye of the images of Blackness in our current society. A good book to own, even if you only read the chapters that sound interesting to you."
4,NOT a 3/4 Helmet,"This is a modified 1/2 helmet, but still a great helmet at the price. The visor is a little loose and moves around a bit, but nothing too annoying. Fits well, is sturdy, and not all that uncomfortable (not THAT comfortable either). Great buy for the price, shipped ahead of time. Would buy from vendor again."
4,Good helmet!,"very good helmet for this price , good quality not so havy !! super !! The sizes seem to run small, as with much things made in china, so order at least one size bigger than you typically would!!! sorry for my englsh , i am not english speaker :-("
5,Excellent Helmet for Serious Motorcycle Riders,"This helmet is pretty sturdy and fits well. Easy to put on and off. I have used it in about 60 degrees weather of New Jersey, and it has kept me cool. It looks decent and has a Matt surface. I showed it to my seasoned friend biker, and he approved of it right away."
3,alright helmet,"the helmet fits nice. my only problem with this helmet, is that it doesn't have a protecter for your chin from the metal clasp. otherwise a good helmet"
4,Quality Helmet,"I wear this helmet. I have only ever worn full helmets in the past.Key points:The neck/rear lining is very nice and zips off.The visor handles any wind-speed I have attained without coming loose. (Like 90mph)The styling is not an issue for me.Negative points:This helmet is domed. Being smoothly rounded it must accommodate for the width of the ears. Some helmets have the ear area built out as separate strata. Without glasses and a riding jacket the helmet looks out of proportion. I always wear glasses and a riding jacket so they balance out.This helmet's foam portion will adjust to your head after regular use, which is good; however it was uncomfortable for the first dozen or so wears.Overall a good purchase. But potentially a stylistic issue for the vain or the small of frame. A more ""military"" looking half-helmet may suit them better."
4,Useful.... but you really should get a sound level meter,..to go along with it. Otherwise you will be making a lot of ad hoc adjustments which won't make a meaningful difference when you listen to real music.
4,Solid power metal album,"I'm not a metal expert by any means, but I must say, this a darn good album. Admittedly, the vocals in a few of the tracks took some getting used to, but overall quite good. Solid musicianship. Good production."
5,Great Book!,"I read this book a while ago, but it's still my favorite book! Kit is just a normal girl, who's a little confused about life. I recommend this book to any young girl."
4,Inside My Cage,"I thought this book was an O.K. book. It had suspense and things that could absolutely happen to anyone, but I wasn't crazy about this book. I would definitely recommended this book to animal lover's but since I'm not that kind of person, this book didn't really appeal to me. It was a well written book and it's great that many readers could relate to it. You can learn a very important lesson from Kit."
4,THIS BOOK WAS GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!,"Cages is about a girl who shoplifts a bracelet. She has to work 20 hours at the Humane Society. She learns a valuable lesson. I reccomend this book to anybody who has shoplifted,or has thought about shoplifting.Read this book and learn about Kit's everyday life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not enough specifics at least on the 3.8L (Pictures).,"I feel this book leaves a lot of areas lacking in in-deph information for the ""non mechanic"" trying to repair thier own car and save a few dollars. More ""real"" photographs would be a great help. My engine is a 3.8L and this book seemed to have the least info on this engine. Also I felt that info on the same item should be in the same chapter (I.E. info on changing radiator should also talk about water pump,thermostat,sensor, and your water system bleeding requirments).There is a great deal of info - just needs better organization or maybe a better index."
4,Scores of bios and poems of women poets,"Excellent book to study and truly bond with the women of this era, our fore-mothers! Useful as a self-poetry-writing course, as well."
5,Taking Income Tax? Buy this book!,"I strongly, strongly recommend this book for any law student taking an income tax course who has no experience in accounting. I read this book in the beginning of the class- it's relatively short and incredibly readable- and it made the actual class a breeze. Like most law school subjects, it's easy to lose the forest for the trees, and starting off with this book will let you understand how things fit together before you start slogging through- and get lost in- the Code.As a corollary to that, this book is basically useless as an exam prep; it's too much of a general survey of the topic, and if you're using this to prep for your final you are in deep trouble. However, if you just signed up for tax in the winter term, buy this book and read it over break- it'll take you a day or two, and you'll be glad you did."
1,More of the same: brown fungus and small crabs instead of green goo?,Take Lemony Snicket seriously when he says don't read it!People can write just about any ridiculous thing and call it a children's book.Don't let your kids read this mind rotting dribble.If fish were in your shoes they would suffocate.I see no virtue in repeating a bad formula over and over again.This book is more dismal and less imaginative than the last terrible oneand the pictures aren't even as good.
2,Not so good for a collector.,"This author's books are compared to Edward Gorey's; Gorey has an adult following. I realize these books are printed for the (children's) story rather than the artwork (unlike Gorey's books), but I believe the author tries to appeal to adult collectors as well as to young readers. As an adult hoping for an amusing and tame but macabre read, I was disappointed in his series. The author enjoys his own sense of humor very much; I can't say the same for the reader. My question is, how many times will he keep rehashing the same plot, with the same unfunny villain? Even the kids are going to catch on and grow tired of the same mediocre story appearing over and over. This is not an author who crosses over into the world of adult reading, much as he tries."
1,"Horrible, How can people read such horrible books","That is the worst display of childrens lituture I've ever seen. It made me cringe and almost vomit. It is not fitting for anyone above being born. If you want to read a good book read Holes, by Louis Sacher. He, unlike L. Snicket knows how to write a good book. I hope this review is helpful because I am just trying to help the good old American consumer. You might want to listen to me , for no matter how harsh I sound I'm just trying to help.Thank you for your time."
4,"review on ""Austere Academy""","I thought this was a good book!If you've read the other books in this series you might even think it was the best one yet!This book is wonderfully awfull!It includes a rather odd vice principal,strange teachers,and even stranger gym teacher(who could possibly be Count Olof!)Finally to find out the end to this wonderfully horrible book you will just have to read it."
5,Best book so far in the series,"Just imagine your parents just died in a horrible fire, and your parents just left behind a huge fortune. Worst of all the banker responsible for your giant fortune kept putting you in places where a greedy filthy man would do anything to get your fortune, this man name is Count Olaf .This adventure was the toughest for Violet, Klaus, and Sunny. They were about to enter boarding. Where a mean Vice principal by the name of Nero. Who thinks he is genius on the violin but he is not but he still holds a nine hour concert each night. When the gym teacher mysteriously quits anew gym teacher comes read the book to find who this new gym teacher is, and what he does."
3,Disappointed.,"After having read the first five books of this series one after the other, I find I'm rather depressed. It was nice for the orphans to have made some friends, however. Snicket's defining words as they relate to his story instead of the dictionary definitions has become more egregious. Inevitable does not, ever, mean ""a lifetime of horror and woe."" As we all know, the definition of inevitable is ""unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped,"" which would have worked perfectly well in Snicket's narrative."
5,The Start of a Thrilling NEW mytery!,"I started this series with THE REPTILE ROOM and have been a fan of these books ever since. So when I say, ""I love this series! Read it! Read it!"" I'm not just saying it because everyone elce is reading it. In fact, most of my friends think it's too boring and confusing to read. But those warning notes in the begining make me want to read them even more. AUSTERE ACADAMY is the only book in the series where I got bored for a few minutes. I can't tell you why, but it involves Count Olf and S.O.R.E. (Special Orphan Running Exercises.) But the one boring five or two minutes is made up for with the part at the end where a clue is left that leaves you hankering for the next eight books..."
5,"Detail You Might Hate, But You Need It...","This will not be a long review. There is a similarity to Robert Kaplan's books, and my reviews of his other books will suffice for additional detail.Having said that, I will also say that this book continues an excellent pattern of combining prior reading of history, a solid understanding of geography, and a gift for drawing out from an astonishing diversity of individuals, those little details that may bore in the aggregate but are priceless when endured and absorbed.He seems to have missed the genocide against the Tatars, but perhaps that was hidden from him.There is one huge gem, at least for me, in this book, and that is his assessment of the potential for a new schism between Western and Eastern Christianity, and how that must be avoided at all costs. This one sentence and the surrounding text is alone worth the price of the book."
1,These are only good for thin wrists,"I was very disappointed to see that these are in no way ankle weights, unless perhaps you are a thin child. I bought these to use as ankle weights and there is no way these would fit my ankles. I am 5'7"" and 135 pounds, so I am hardly overweight. These should only be advertised as wrist weights. Also, they are one pound each. I may return them."
5,Great Resource for Parents!,I am a local family counselor and I write a blog for a local non-profit counseling agency. We try to find good resources for our readers and I stumbled across this book. A friend of mine had read this book when she had her first child. She praised the author and book and felt it had really helped her learn how to be playful with her kids. I ordered it for work and began reading. It has a great deal of helpful ideas but it also helps you understand why playing with your kids is so important. I would recommend this book to any parent. It is an easy read and incredibly helpful. The 5 minute fun activities will really help you find fun in everyday interactions with your child.
5,Love it!,"Trying to find a square table cloth locally has been a challenge. I love Amazon because they always have whatever I am looking for.This table cloth is GREAT! The color is perfect, it's well made, and stain resistant. This is an inexpensive yet elegant table cloth. I would recommend to anyone who is not looking to spend a lot of money to get good quality."
3,Boys Night Out - Make Yourself Sick,"Boys Night Out pulls off the ever-popular ""smooth vocals & screaming"" sound with unmatched superiority. That being said, these Canadians don't belt out anything ground breaking; but when front man Conor Lovat-Fraser yelps into his mic, he does so with convincing attitude. This is fun music; and while the lyrical content can seem a tad repetitive, it too has it's novelty. Check out, ""The First Time It Shouldn't Taste Like Blood,"" and ""The Fine Art of Making It Out Alive."" 3/5"
4,an oldy but a goody,"I have had this album for a good while now and it never bores me, its chirpy, well written, and extremely catchy, not being a particular fan of pop this certainly proves to me that when mixed with a little post hardcore definitely worth a earwig. Although the album sounds bouncy and punky the lyrics are pretty dark and brutal at times and well sang with an occasional scream to back them up. The guitaring is fast and technical, and full of unusual timing. There is a great variety of tracks from hardcore to acoustic to plain old punk but all made very experimentally great use of synth, and keyboards. The great thing about this album is I find myself singing the words to myself randomly even after not listening to it for several months. This album is power pop at its best, if you are thinking of exploring this band I recommend this album rather than the highly disappointing ""train wreck"". Check these guys out but be warned these songs are real, real catchy."
2,Do not buy - get an updated version!,"this book was horribly out of date when I used it in Kenya/Uganda in Feb-Apr 2009. kenya phone numbers had changed to 7 digits and this only had 6 digit numbers making it virtually useless for arranging stuff. furthermore, many of the descriptions were outdated and inaccurate. For example, the hotel they said was the nicest in eldoret, kenya and gave a rather glowing review of was dilapidated and dirty, and there were two nicer hotels in the city."
5,Great Series,Awesome buy at a great price. I really enjoyed every episode and my only complaint was that this was the end of the series.
5,Greatest Sci FI - you have to watch this!!!,"This is so wonderful - I have watched this many many times - it is mystery, sci fi, western, romance, excitement - Lots of science and just plain perfect!"
5,A little masterpiece,"I had never seen Firefly the series, but I read all the glowing Amazon reviews and decided to give it a try.I wish to publicly thank you all for not leading me astray. It's a gem of great story telling and wonderful character development. Really evil enemies and villains (especially the Reavers) to avoid or overcome. Neat special effects to please the eye. Plus plenty of extras. Who could ask for anything more?"
5,should have gone longer on the series,I love this series. It should have kept going longer. They just didn't do a good job marketing it when it was on TV. Definitely watch this before you watch the movie Serenity.
5,awesome,i almost died when i saw that they were making a season thing ondvd i love firefly but flippen fox ended it i was so mad i was as mad as when the canceled cover me and usa i was p od anyways im asking for this for christmas this is the only thing im asking for for xmas so i know ill gett it i love thissssss yay
3,love this show but way too much sex!,Really enjoyed it but the last couple episodes had way too much sex. Intimacy should be between husband and wife and is sacred and private.
5,wow,"if you like buffy and angel you'll love this. if you don't like buffy and angel you'll like this. eevryone will like this. the funniest thing i have ever seen, incredible plots, incredible characters and spaceships! even if you don't like sci-fi you'll like this (it actaully turned me into a sci-fi nerd) trust me. buy it, watch it, love it. then wonder why they cancelled it."
5,Nathan Fillion is HOT!!!,Okay the writing and story line of this series was awesome!!! kept me hooked but unfortunately the networks had their heads you know where. Liked the undertone of comedy
4,"Got a bad rap, deserved better","This series got off on the wrong foot when the pilot wasn't aired. I had trouble figuring out what was going on when it was on the air. Thank God the whole pilot is on the DVD set. It's a great show, that had serious promise. Too bad the network shafted it from the start, then didn't give it time to find it's audience. If you're a Buffy/Angel fan, give this one a chance."
4,Loved it,I wished i'd have known about this show before it went off-air. My dad had the series and the Serenity movie I watched both and wish there was more. I wasn't sure i'd like the show but i'd heard about the movie so i decided to give the show a try. I really enjoyed it. I think those zombie things are freaky but they never really show much gore. I like all the characters each is very different. I thought the westerness of it was a nice suprise. I liked the people more in the show than in the movie because i got to know them more.I wish they could continue the show right where they left off. Stop reading reviews and get this show even if your only a little interested because you won't regret it.
5,The most awesome series that ever got cancelled,"My husband is a huge Sci-Fi addict and had seen all these shows before. For Christmas He got his new 46"" plasma, 120hz flatscreen, blueray, so I ordered him a couple of movies as presents. I'd never seen this series before, and I literally watched all 13 or 14 episodes, back to back, without interuption. Wow, this was an awesome series and should never have been cancelled. I recommend this for everyone who enjoys excellent writing, great characters, and great humor."
4,A series that needs to be brought back!,"If you haven't seen Firefly, but are a fan of witty, character-driven original sci-fi, go out on a limb and buy this series. It should never have been canceled!"
4,Firefly DVD,"The firefly series is fantastic and my 2 sons have loved watching a borrowed series. So much so that they decided to purchase their own copy on Amazon. However the cover arrived broken, and the DVD doesnt play on our player in Australia so they were pretty disappointed. I have bought DVDs from Amazon before and there wasnt any description about which regions it would or wouldnt play in."
4,Great series DVD format not so great,"The series itself is great, and being able to watch the episodes in the correct order is a treat. The DVD format is a pain in the but there isnt a play all option and you have to hit the enter button like 3 times to view an episode. All in all its a quality purchase if you are a fan despite the annoying DVD menus"
4,Fantastic series,"Absolutely phenomenal TV series, too bad it was cut short. The series itself deserves five stars, but not only was the case not the one pictured, it had a piece that had broken off when I got it. Not a big deal, it is just nice to know what you are buying, and a bummer when it arrives a little bit broken when purchased new."
1,Tedious,"I can not bring myself to sit through an entire episode of this show, although I have tried to watch nearly half of them! The program bores me to such a point I can not even keep myself awake. What I espeacially can not understand is how out of the nine or so characters only Simon interests me at all. I can never tolerate how Joss Whedon's shows swap good dialogue for semi-witty wisecracks. Now I have heard a feature film will be made. Just goes to show one how the world of the cinema has run out of ideas."
4,"Firefly,","Good story lines, very good acting, outstanding special effects.Just saw the ""Serenety"" movie, and it was excellent as well.I hope ""they"" do more with this, SciFi channel is running the Firefly series, perhaps that will push this into a sequel."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I am not normally a fan of Science Fiction, but I happened to catch a couple episodes of this show during its Fox run.(No thanks to them for me ACCIDENTLY noticing it)What I saw was really good despite the fact I was joining mid-season. So, I didn't fully understand everything, but what I did was great.Now that I have watched the complete series from beginning to end in the order intended, I am hard pressed to think of a better show that was able to so quickly start rolling and get you interested in EVERY member of the cast. Truly excellent material.Shame on you, Fox. You are turning into a cesspool... ""Simple Life"" my ass... I can't get AWAY from the marketing for THAT tripe."
5,The best thing that ever happened to SCI-FI television,"If you don't love this show just go ahead and turn in your geek card. I am serious, the cancellation of this show could be argued as the begin of the downfall of television as we know it. One day you will be able to tell your kids that you actually saw great TV. One day..."
4,Firefly,"Thanks for the prompt delivery! I have always wanted this collection and I hoped you would have it, and you did!, and for alot less than the retail price. Thank you!!"
4,Bring it back,"Great series that ended too soon. DVDs are good, but not great. Not a whole lot of extras, but worth it if you like the series."
5,FOX SUUUUCKS!,"I had never even heard of Firefly till I saw the preview for Serenity. After I saw the preview I was interested. My brother got the box set and after watching the entire series nonstop till 3 in the mornig i had one simple comment, FOX SUCKS. After that i said more but im gonna keep it PG here. The show is excellent and should have gone on longer.When watching I also thought that it never looked or felt like a fox show. To me it looked more WB then Fox. Im hoping that WHEN the movie does EXTREMELY wel Fox will start it up again. Hell Maybe WB can buy the rights from Fox."
4,It's Firefly,"It's Firefly--of course it's good. The only complaint I have is this: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and thought I'd be getting that nifty collector's box shown in the picture with it. Nope. I got a single DVD case with 4 DVDs inside. But hey, it's still Firefly. So it's good."
5,A great TV-show on an unfair network,"Firefly is one of those things you either fall completely in love with or you can't stand. I am in category one, after purchasing the complete DVD-set. It kept impressing me; there are no bad episodes, great actors, a story you want to know more about, plenty of exciting extramaterials - I could go on for a long time. Too bad Fox Network didn't take better care of what fell in their lap. But still, one of the better shows out there - buy this and some snacks and you've got your weekend set! ;)"
4,Great fun,"Firefly is a fun mix of science fiction and western. Although the plot and the characters are formulaic, the formula works. It's well written, funny, and the actors are good.For an ambitious, thoughtful show, look somewhere else, but if you just want to laugh and to be entertained, Firefly it is."
2,Noisy as heck!!,"I love the series but this Blu-ray looks terrible! The worse BR i have looked at, so far. It has an insane amount of film-grain effect added to it. I am sure they thought it made it look grittier, but c'mon! This extra noise makes the compression look poor (because image noise kills compression algorithms.) Using an Oppo player on the original DVD's gives me a better viewing experience and only a bit less detail. If you want to squeeze every bit of detail out of the image, get them; if not, stick to the DVD set and use a good DVD player with HD scaler (like the amazing Oppo!)"
5,Firefly...,You either love it or have never heard of it...WE LOVE THE SERIES. Our boys got us hooked on the show.
5,Cut short before the prime of its life,"Firefly was one of Joss Whedon's more interesting ideas, a cross between science fiction and the old West where the good guys are actually bad guys. The chemistry between the cast members worked marvelously and it's difficult to point to any one member and say that (s)he made the show great. The sharp contrast in technology - blasters vs gunpowder, for example - made the concept interesting as did the contrast between the characters. They also made the whole idea a lot more fun to watch. It's too bad network executives couldn't handle the premise and killed the show with only 15 episodes being aired."
2,Full Screen ??? Has FOX gone mad ???,"Darn, I was just about to pre-order this when I saw that FOX has chosen to release this in Pan and Scan, full screen. Yuck ! That sucks big time. I'll wait till they do the right thing by fans and release it in WIDESCREEN. I have been following this series on the internet for some time hoping that it may be released over here, the DVD news promised great things but now I feel I've been short changed. I would give 5 stars for widescreen, but this shabby treatment from Fox deserves only 2."
5,Firefly: The Complete Happiness,"Firefly: The Complete Series is an excellent purchare. The Series introduce a blend of western and space-opera and the good plot contain action, adventure, drama and very comedy of course. The character are well and definite with a story captivate from the beginning.The format blu-ray display a superior image and the sound is simply perfect. And the complete series in a single box- three discs- is an authentic luxury. And moreover, a luxury very cheap because the price is fantastic.Indispensable purchare.The film Serenity complete the history and is great too."
5,the best,Firefly is unique and completely deserves its passionate fan devotion.One of the best things ever produced for television.
5,What can I say?,"This is one of, if not the very best science fiction/space adventure shows ever made. I didn't even find out about it until it had already gone off the air. The fans rallied, a movie was made, and it failed, too. What is wrong w/people? You have shows out there like Survivor and American Idol, so called reality shows that couldn't be farther from reality, but they are so popular they just keep making more and more and more of that type of junk. Then you have a series like Firefly that gets canceled. What is wrong w/people???? Thank goodness it's on DVD so it can be bought and viewed over and over again. It's that good."
2,Blu-ray but not remaster,"The blu-ray version isn't a remaster. Others said it was an improvement, but I'm not getting the full HD experience I've come to expect. It's graining and I'm only on a 42"" plasma. There are only a few extra features/commentaries that have been added. So, replacing my DVD set was a waste of money too my view.If you are purchasing the series for the first time, you can go with the blu-ray for the little extra cost if you want. But if you own the DVD set, I wouldn't replace it for this and I'm not going to recommend you pay the extra for the Blu-ray at this point."
5,Firefly - Serenity (the series) Review,I love Joss Whedon. I loved his Buffy and Angel series and I love this series too. The movie (Serenity)will be out in September so get a jump on the move and get this series first. You won't be disappointed.
5,One of the Best Shows Ever,"excellent show, shouldn't have been cancelled, everyone needs to see it. enough said."
5,Too bad there isn't a 6th star,"This would be one of few things I would ever give such a high rating. I hadn't heard of Firefly ever unitl recently (sadly I was out of the country for its entire run), but it truely is one of the best shows I've ever seen. In particular, I love the last four episodes and watch them quite often without tire. The movie is amazing too, an absolute must have."
4,Good series.,I wish the series would have continued. I would like to see more stories of this quality. Too bad it didn't make it!
2,Why was it cancelled after 14 episodes? It sucks!,"I can't believe all the hype about this show. My husband and I started watching the series on DVD right after finishing the Six Feet Under series, which we loved. Maybe we needed more time between shows to lower our standards, because by comparison, Firefly plays out like a high school production. The dialogue is poorly written, the jokes are predictable, the characters are one-dimensional, and the acting is VERY average. (Nathan Fillion does a respectable job, but the rest of the ensemble I expect to be unemployed for a long time.) We are simply stunned at the response to this show. One reviewer hailed it as the ""next Star Wars"". What the ??!!? Not even close. Not even a light year away."
2,Not surprised it was cancelled after the first season,"I'm sure I will be flamed by raving fanboys, but this series is nothing special for me. Like others I bought this pack because of all the 5 star reviews making it out to be the best show ever made. Personally I think people are like that because it was cancelled early and they needed something to fill their voided nerd lives. (I'm a geek, so I understand) This was not a horrible show, some of the acting was good, but overall I found it boring and dragged out. Don't buy it unless you have seen some episodes already, and keep in mind the movie ""Serenity"" was the highlight of this story, the show was not as good. It would have been better to make a trilogy movie with a complete close to this story, there was no way this could have been kept interesting as a multi-year show. Sorry people, but that's the truth. Check out Babylon 5 for a good long series. ;-)"
5,This DVD is actually widescreen,Just a note for people put off by the full-screen format. Chris Buchanan of Mutant Enemy has assured us that the release info was erroneous and that the final product is in fact widescreen (16:9).
5,Firefly - to Blu-Ray or not to Blu-Ray,"So, I read all the reviews I could to see whether or not the Blu-Ray version was much better than the DVD's up-converted. The reviews seemed to be 50/50, half the reviews saying the Blu-Ray images blew the DVD out of the water, and the other half saying it didn't look any better. I took the plunge, sold the DVD's to relatives and bought the Blu-Ray discs. I have now watched the first four episodes on disc 1, and I can confidently say... I'm not sure.I was not really blown away by the difference in quality between the Blu-Ray version and watching the DVD's up-converted on my Blu-Ray player. I believe there are places, certain scenes, (maybe the outer space shots) where the Blu-Ray shines a bit more, but I am not overwhelmed. I am now wondering if the movie (Serenity) will be different. That will be next on my agenda.I still give the review 5 stars because this is an amazing fun show. Its premature cancellation was a tragedy!"
5,Terrific!,"What a fantastic and enjoyable series. It is amazing that this didn't become a multi-season production. Complex characters, funny dialogue, really a lot of fun."
5,One of the best!,"It is truly one of the most creative and most underappreciated TV shows since ""Freaks and Geeks"". I dare anyone to stop watching this show after you get past the fourth episode. It is so original and the characters are extreemly likeable. Try it, and you will just as sad as I am that this show had to go away."
4,I can understand the enormous following,"I watched this for the first time. It was quite entertaining. It is sad that there isn't more because I have developed an interest in the characters. You can tell that the director had a lot planned as so many ideas were set in motion. I can't give it 5 starts for two reasons: Firstly, The Blu-ray transfer wasn't that good. Lot's of noise. The opening battle scene in the first episode was terrible in terms of video noise. It made me feel that the whole series might be like that. Fortunately, it wasn't as bad but still not a clean transfer. Secondly, it's not appropriate for younger aged children due to adult themes (sexuality, violence and brief nudity). I realize that this was intended but I find this unfortunate because I believe this series could have had a broader reach which may have helped it to survive (or not - no one really knows)."
5,"Awesome TV show, can't believe it was cancelled!","I never saw this show on TV, as I never heard about it (bad or no advertising, I guess?). It is a fantastic TV show, and I can't believe it got cancelled! I'd watch 10 seasons of this, easy! Definitely recommended for anyone who's seen the movie Serenity or just wants to get into the Firely series. An awesome, awesome TV show if you like Sci-Fi with a Western mix! There's nothing else like it."
5,This is a fantastic series I wish I had seen it when it first aired and wish it were still on!,"This Western- sci fi is so satisfying. The characters are beautifully drawn the messages are basic , loyalty, love and never overpowering or politically correct. Many shows may try to emulate it but I fear they will fail. watch it with the movie Serenity and you will have a nice 14 hour movie. I missed the fan days when my voice might have made a difference in getting another movie out o the series continued, but who knows.You will like this even if you are not a sci- fi or western fan."
5,Outstanding show,"I'm sure that with all the 5 star reviews you see, you can pretty much guess what you can expect with this box set. Its a spectacular show with a great script that died before its time. At the current $20 price, its a bargain to buy."
5,Wow! I had no idea what I'd been missing.,"I've only made it through the first 2 DVDs so far, but I'm already in love. This series is *really* well done. It's such a pleasure!I saw ""Serenity"" before watching these, and I'm becoming a huge fan. Both the series and the movie are such a refreshing change from Star Wars. No more inane kid-friendly pap, like Jar-Jar and ewoks. This is a wonderful and ""real"" feeling movie and series, and they seem to deftly interweave humor, gritty reality, a surreal mix of folksy backwoodsmen with sophisticates, and an interesting moral and ethical arc. Wow!I'm sorry Mr. Lucas. Joss Whedon is my master now..."
3,Blu-ray isn't worth the price,"The show was only airing for about 14 episodes, so you're paying quite and bit for one season (if you pay the $90 price tag they show). The Blu-ray looks like a poor remaster and hardly worth it. Buy the standard version, save your cash, and allow your BR player to upscale. You'll have similar quality.The show was ended before it's time, thank you Fox and your discontent for all things sci-fi."
5,Underrated and killed before its time.,"A great cast, great writing, a very interesting setting, and mysteries to uncover later on, but Fox didn't keep it around. Damn them.There's so little of interest on TV for me, that when the best of the shows doesn't make it, it makes one lose interest in the media itself."
3,SERENITY FLYS AGAIN,"Have to admit, I wasn't a fun of the show when it was on Tv. After seeing serenity I fell in love with (Summer Glau). Then I just had to buy this set. Now I glad I did! I like it! I meen I know why it did not do well but Ilike it. In my opintion why Firefly didn't do that well, is because it had a wester feel to it. Come on Joss what were you thinking SI-FI WESTER dosn't mix. Ya the movie had some in it but not a big feeling. and they tone down the japaneey in the movie as well. But buy this TV show plus Summer hot...."
5,The show that burned very brightly for a very short time.,"Like the bug it's named after, this show burned very brighly for an instant. I never even knew it was on TV, but I heard about it after the fact through friends once the DVD series set was released.I can't really say anything about this show that hasn't been said, but I supposed the most amazing thing to me about Firefly is that my wife doesn't even like sci-fi as a genre, but she really loved this series.The stories and the characters transcend the genre. Firefly isn't just great sci-fi, but great story telling period."
5,Best. Show. Ever.,"If you've never heard of firefly... buy it. watch it.If you didn't like firefly... you have no taste and no imagination.This sci-fi show has three dimensional down-to-earth characters and a fantastic plot. Compared to this, Buffy was practice. Joss Whedon's great concept was cut tragically short by a network that (we hope) is kicking itself at the moment. The firefly series is only four discs. The persistent fans got us a movie, Serenity, so we could finally say good-bye."
5,Why was this show cancelled?,Firefly is so much smarter than most shows on TV today or in the last few years. I just don't understand why it was cancelled. It's a wonderful show and this DVD boxset is more than worth buying. The show is addictive.
5,One of THE BEST,"Firefly is not only one of the best Sci-Fi shows, it is probably one of the top ten series ever on TV. And the movie was even better. Hard to believe it was cancelled. One can always dream that it would ever comeback.I like StarGate, Battle Star G, Babylon 5 etc. but Firefly is in a class of its own, even above these others."
4,Firefly,the product shipped in a timely manner. The DVD series is great. It is the same quality you can get in the store only cheaper.
3,actually pretty good,"Watching these DVD's changed my mind about this cancelled series. I still don't like the metally-damaged sister -- she is just annoying. And the Preacher doesn't get to do much in any of the episodes. But the writing is smart and often successfully witty. Many of the central characters are memorable. When one considers how bad the last couple of Star Trek series have been, it is a shame Firefly was cancelled so quickly."
5,This series deserves 10 stars not just 5,"This series is so good... The characters become established as unique individuals immediately upon introduction. There is humor, wit (lots and lots of wit!!!), action, seamless special effects, drama, sci-fi elements and excellent acting. Every character is complex, mysterious, and credibly portrayed. The storylines are engrossing - you are never quite sure what is going to happen next. This is a rare series where the acting, writing, and effects all come together to create sophisticated and fun entertainment. Those who like cliched sitcoms and tired hospital/law enforcement drama will not be able to keep up."
5,no power in the 'verse can stop them...,"And remember, every time you support a canceled Fox show, somewhere a network executive loses his wings.(...)"
2,Buy the DVDs,"It does not differ appreciably from watching the DVDs with decent upscaling (say, a PS3). If anything it looked a bit worse, because the graininess is now ""sharper"". Buy the DVDs, they're equivalent, and much cheaper."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed to find that Disc 1 had a number of ""bad spots"" on it that froze the feed and forced me to jump to the next scene. Other than that, the rest of the discs worked fine."
5,great series great price,great series great price. I love this program and I'm happy to have it on blu ray. wish it would have come with a few more extras but then it would have been more money
5,Great series is an understatement!,"I for one do not watch any tv. When I saw the movie Serenity, I immediately loved the well developed characters, the settings, the story. Its been years where an ensemble cast is so likable literally. A friend actually informed me that this was based on a tv series. I immediately bought this dvd set and watched the whole thing incidentally in a matter of three days. It was excellant. I also learned that that this show was cancelled. I would say this is almost a tragedy because there is so much utter crap on tv that to have a show of this caliber cancelled is tragedy. I wish Sci-Fi or for that matter any company would pick up and restart this show. Please!"
3,firefly-the complete series,"For loyal fans of the series the cancellation of Firefly came asa big blow.But much to the chagrin of its critics and the network execs who canceled the show, it's release on DVD was an enormous sucess.This set of DVD's contains the entire series and three unaired episodes.The extras include the everything from the ""History of Earth that was"" to outtakes.This DVD box set is a delight for all the fans of the FIREFLY series, be they BROWNCOATS or ALLIANCE."
1,Does not fit Dr. Brown's 7 oz bottles,I tried putting the Dr. Brown's bottle (7oz) with nipple and cap in this tote and it doesn't fit. The tote is about 1 inch too short.
5,"Bad movie? Maybe, but this score release is top-notch.",The Punisher (1989) represents the end of an era of low-budget action films and tries to cram every cliche it can (including ninjas) into it. But a standout feature of the movie has always been its gritty yet comic-book-grounded score. A personal favorite and I am glad to add this to my collection.
3,Not easy to read,"I am married, with kids and fulltime job and compete in Masters road cycling - so time efficient training is what I want. I had discovered this book by searching google and following ashwin's blog - finally the book was reprinted and I got a copy - I am a little disappointed in it, I feel the theory of hi intensity training is covered better in both Arnie Bakers 'Hi-intensity cycling' and in Michael Ross's 'Maximum performance for cyclists' - the Ross book has copped some negative comments, and for me his recommended workouts were simply too hard, but it gives the groundwork for time efficient training - both those books I found more useful than Morris's."
1,This Book is a [deceptive],"The author just wants you to PAY HIM FOR COACHING! He won't give you enough information in the book to design your own training program and he won't answer a simple question about his book without GETTING MONEY FROM YOU IN ADVANCE. He's a con artist and put this book out to promote his ""coaching"". (...)"
1,"Not just useless, but also wrong","For 25 years, I wrote all the questions for a local (Champaign, IL) TV quiz show for high school students. I quickly learned to double-check and often triple-check my answers before using them on the air. (I did get stung a few times in the beginning: the old chestnut about the Great Wall of China being visible from the moon, etc.)It looks like no double-checking was done here. Simply put, this book is an embarrassment. The authors present page after page of urban legend and incorrect information. Please, don't astound your friends with any of the ""facts"" in this book without checking snopes.com first.The Penguin Press should be ashamed of itself for printing this bookload of misinformation without bothering to verify it."
2,Too much vocals,"I should've listened to all the clips b/4 I purchased this music...I bought it to enhance the yoga class I teach. I was disappointed to have so much vocalization, which I find distracting during yoga practice. I will probably end up choosing the two or three selections of pure instrumental and putting them on a CD."
5,Great Road Atlas,"We use this road atlas during our drives, along with the GPS. Sometimes, the GPS gives the wrong road name and this atlas really helps."
1,Too Much Trouble,"Casio has come up with a metal watch band that even a jeweler can't figure out how to remove links in. Furthermore they don't include instructions for metal watchband link removal and for good reason... it's way to complicated. Gone are the days of simply pressing a pin in a small hole to remove a link. Casio customer service told me I could send the watch to them for sizing... for a fee... never mind the fact I might make a mistake and ask them to remove too few or too many links. They need to figure out a more hassle free metal watchband if they want my business. I returned the watch to Amazon, thankful at least Amazon has got their act together concerning how to treat a customer. Casio is totally out to lunch concerning the band design on this watch."
5,Jade rocks!,Jade is the prettiest! She is definetly a trend setter and ALWAYS has amazing clothes! Jade is my fave!!(PS: They should have Bratz dolls called Girlz on the job when they dress trendy for work!)That would be 2 cute!
5,Great toy for the kids,"My two boys love this castle and play various different games with it all the time. It is large enough for two boys (6 and 3) to play with together, especially when folded out. It is sturdy and well built, and I love that it came prebuilt and didn't require construction time. Much better than the plastic castles competitors offer. Amazon shipping and packaging was very well done and very quick. Pleased with my purchase."
3,3.5 Stars,"I was searching for more groove metal in the vein of Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power and this came back as being tagged ""groove metal"" more than most other albums. What the Hell, right? Might as well give it a shot.I can see some similarities to Pantera. When the vocalist used spoken word vocals, he can sound remarkably like Phil Anselmo, but this strikes me as much more reminiscent of Lamb of God, in that it's closer to extreme metal than Pantera ever was and tends to be based more on ultra heavy, repeated riffs than on the grooves.Despite these differences, Chimaira has made a pretty strong album. The songs can be a little repetitive within their own structures, but are generally entertaining and make for a good listen. Initial rating of 3.5/5.0, though I'll need to give this another spin to see how it feels after multiple listens."
2,WHERE ARE THE TV MOVES!!,"When I picked up the Canadian release years Age I was so happy that it came out,And now with this release i really thought they where going to include the TV Moves with it. I was wrong! The Only way to get the movies right now is to find the VHS taps (SUPPER! hard to find). If you have A VHS and can get your hands on the tapes I recommend waching them before you buy this release. The Series builds so much on the movies that it is A required prerequisite. So If you want to buy it go ahead but i recommend waching the movies first."
3,More than four missing...,"I agree with Greg and the other reviewers that (at least) the first four episodes are clearly missing from this so-called Complete Series"", the first one being the two-hour pilot. HOWEVER, in case you haven't noticed, there are even MORE missing episodes as well from the other end -- right up until the series was cancelled. For example, what happened to all the later episodes, where, after Dr. Kitteridge's fake death from a car bomb, her android dupe gets activated by Jake Cardigan from a cryptic email that he gets when visiting her old lab. Then after her android double gets online, they go off together and solve further crimes? So, if this canadian company is supposedly releasing the REAL complete series, they better include those missing episodes that were at the end of the series as well."
3,Star Trek meets TJ Hooker,"This delightful film is and interesting blend of 20th century meets the future. I enjoyed it as most SciFi fans would. Not the big money action film of today, however it has interesting challenges. On the whole, I consider it Star trek meets TJ Hooker."
5,Diahann Carroll,I purchased this movie as well as the CD and I enjoyed this movie. I watched this movie with my mother and this is one of our favorites. Im glad I made the purchase.I would highly recommend this movie.
2,"Sometimes nice, sometimes cloying","After a third listen to this CD, I conclude that if I walked into a club and this group was playing, I would be very pleased to sit and listen. But I wouldn't go out of my way to hear them. On several tracks, Bokar uses this plucking, popping sound like the pizzicato on a violin (I can't tell whether he does it on the strings or with the electronics). This effect is fine for a few bars but used for a whole track it sounds like one of those cloying coffee percolating commercials from the 60s. The vocals, again, would be OK in the relaxed expectations of a lounge, but on the CD they sound like the lungless singing of Chet Baker (though not that morbid). There are a few tracks that actually swing, but not enough to redeem."
4,"Great price, nice jacket","For the price, this jacket is great. I must warn that it runs small. It is a slim fit jacket. I really needed the medium in the body, but a small in the arm length. Cute fur, striking looking, would work for casual and dressy. I got the brown color."
1,"Software OK, poor customer service","The software is good, but be sure to back it up because you can't save it online and if your computer crashes, you're done.Avoid the online site and message boards. The moderators are power-hungry and weird."
4,Where do your darkest fantasies lie?,"This is a remarkably good movie around the historical charactor Marquis De Sade. Unknown to many people this is no fictional charactor. Rush does an amazing job protraying the keeness of the deep charactoristics invovled in such a role. The disturbingly erotic senses invoked in this chilling production really make you think if you don't get deep into the movie you may just get disgusted instead of intreagued. I would recommend this movie to a select group who may truely appriciate this masterpiece, but it's something everyone should see someday."
2,"""Quills"" just doesn't hit the target","Oh my. ""Quills"" is one of those movies you buy on a leap of faith because of all the Academy Award nominations and great actors. Then, (and you know how fickle the Academy Awards nominations can be) you ask yourself ""Why?"" The cast is terrific! Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Shakespear in Love and Mystery Men), Kate Winslet (Titanic), Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator) and the great Michael Caine (The Cider House Rules) do their best to get the viewer interested but even they can only do so much. There is nothing in Quills. It's banal, boring, not credible and a general disappointment. If you want to find out about the Marquis de Sade watch the A & E Channel's Biography on him and pick up one of his works. They are still printed. Chances are you'll start to rewind the movie before it's halfway through like I did."
2,Kaufman should have studied history first,"Not only this movie is absolutely inaccurate about historical facts, Sade's real life and date of death, life in asylums in Napoleon's time, but also the plot vanishes, it seems quite lost, almost unbelievable. In brief, it's the second movie of this year (Quills and Unbreakable), where the chance to tell an excellent story is lost due to this kinf of problems."
3,Good movie,"I would recommend this movie to people who love literature and history. The casting, acting, costuming and staging was wonderful. The story is about the Marquis de Sade who tries to sell his controversial writing to the public even though he himself is indisposed. An altogether sensational movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Geoffrey Rush did a great job in the role of the Marquis, his acting was superb."
1,Awesome sound and great lighting... HOWEVER...,"The camerawork is way, way too fast... even on the slow songs. Yes, we're watching it at home. But this ain't MTV. There's no need to treat it like a three minute video. (Does MTV even show music videos anymore?) This would be my absolute favorite DVD if I didn't get a headache watching it. Very disappointing. Maybe the next one will be viewable."
1,Worked for me for about 2 hours,"This memory was qualified for my Dell Inspiron 1501. It installed just fine, but after running for about 2 hours I got a blue screen crash - and kept getting them until I reinstalled the old memory.Maybe there is a reason it was half the cost of the memory Dell sells..."
1,This doll is gross!!!,"I can't stand to look at the toy, as well as writing this review is even harder because it makes me think of the money i spent on it, and the innapropriante look....it is TERRIBLE! I do not like Bratz anymore...Instead, now i have my eye on the ""Wee 3 friends"" barbie dolls, which have no or very little make-up which is a great gift to give to a younger child...THESE AREN'T! I DO NOT RECOMEND THESE TOYS FOR ANY AGE!!!Later*peace~Canadian_Chix_rule!"
2,So-So,I have many books on the subject - this one would be at the bottom of my list - would be ok for a beginning quilter.
2,"Great for the beginner, not enough for the intermediate~advanced quilter.","I'm glad I checked this out of the library instead of taking the plunge and just buying it. The setting ideas are very, very beginner level. And the book does a fine job of *that,* but it was just a ""flip-through-once"" book for this advanced quilter.I do admit that I liked a lot of the example quilts. They illustrate the most common ways of arranging quilt blocks which are square-shaped.Contents:* straight set* on point* alternating pieced blocks with plain blocks* alternating between two block designs* sashings* framed blocks* blocks set in strips* medallion quilts (concentric borders)* the twist settingThat last one, the twist setting, is handled in much more detail in the book,Twist 'N Turn: A Fun Way to Frame Quilt Blocks. I own that one, and I have reviewed it.If you're a beginning quilter, you will enjoy Sensational Settings. If you have a lot of your own ideas already, skip this one."
3,Bad Editing...terrible director...GREAT subject,"I bought this film and was seriously dissapointed, not by Ann but by the shmuck she allowed to film it. The editing is terrible, some of the camera angles are really unflattering and many scenes unecessary. Do I really need to watch 10 minutes of Anne getting her makeup done? And if we are going to watch that, how about some running commentary behind it? or music at least?The editing was so bad I was shocked that Ann allowed it to go to distribution. Ann, next time, I volunteer my services (though I have no background in film or editing) I know I could have done a better job.I think there should have been more of Ann's speeches, more run ins with protestors...it was too short, not in depth...it was like a surface view. I did enjoy the interview with Bill Maher.Ann Coulter is a cultural icon and this movie just doesn't do her justice."
4,Michael and Me is not a Michael Moore movie,"Reviewer D.J. should be advised that ""Michael and Me"" is a documentary by conservative/libertarian Larry Elder that points out the hypocricy of Michael Moore. It is very likely to be appreciated by fans of Ann Coulter."
5,A Small Book with a Big Message,"""What Autism Means to Me"" gives readers an inside account of what the world looks, feels, sounds, and even smells like to a child with autism. Written from the unique perspective of Caspian, with ""sidelines"" from his family and friends, detailed insights are provided, as a wonderful personality unfolds. What an excellent teaching tool this book is for classrooms, communities, and families with and without disabilities. This real life, participatory book may be small, but it's message is BIG: Kids with autism are incredible human beings. Through Caspian's voice and the ""lifelights"" from those who know him best, we are reminded that all of us have differences. Embracing those differences enriches our world.The Special Needs Ministry Handbook: A Church's Guide to Reaching Children with Disabilities and Their Families"
5,"Listen To It Again, This IS a Great CD","Mistaken Identity took many people by surprise as it featured many new sounds for Donna. Yet this album shows the full spectrum of Donna's unmatched vocal and style range. Songs like ""Get Ethnic"", ""Body Talk"" and ""What It Is You Want"" are far more ""urban"" than anything that she ever recorded since ""Bad Girls"". However her signature sound is not lost here either as tracks like ""Work That Magic"", and ""Fred Astire"" are made for the clubs. Rounding off this CD are the great ballads ""Heaven's Just a Whisper Away"" (later recorded by Regina Belle), ""Let There Be Peace"" , and the CD's best cut a heartfelt tribute to her hardcore fans ""Friend's Unkown"". I can't think of another orginal song ever written to top this one. If this CD took you aback the first go around, rediscover it, you may find yourself loving it."
2,why summers faded,"sometimes you wonder why a great artist fades sometimes its just the times changing and the tastes with them, and in that case an artist's career can gain a second wind, other times, though the muse of inspiration fades with age. unfortunately the second is what happened to donna. her original 70s stuff is more popular thnn ever in the trance scene but this cd is dull and boring due to a lack of inner life to the music. unfortunate, and even more regrettable."
2,wine glasses don't fit,The wine rack has a very nice counter top. The only problem is that wine glasses do not fit!
4,"Good selection of bits, grippy but fussy case",This set offers a good selection of bits in a compact case that won't take up too much space. The only down side is that it can be difficult to remove bits from the firm grip of the case.
5,Santa Calls,"Santa Santa Calls Book ReviewSanta Calls is a book by William Joyce. Art is a boy who lives on a farm. Santa sends his family a box and they fly north in it. When they get there, Santa takes them for a ride. When they are riding, dark elves take Art's sister. Art gets her from the dark elves. Santa Calls is an awesome story. I liked the part when Art made a candy bomb of his own design. To find out this stuff buy Santa Calls.By: Joey"
5,Great Beginner Workout,"Kendall Hogan is a great instructor but he is especially good for anyone starting to exercise or strength train. He keeps his moves easy and basic. Although he is motivating, he is not over the top (like Denise Austin, for example). The moves are challenging enough to keep you interested but not so involved that you get frustrated and give up. I know that I can commit to do these workouts regularly. The upper body and lower body workouts are just 20 minutes each. But, you will work! I recommend this DVD for anyone who is trying to look firmer."
5,Great toning workout,I love this workout. It's separated into 2 parts: 20 minutes each of lower & upper body toning. Kendall gives great instruction and cues. Very easy to follow and the results are fabulous. I have been doing this video for over a year on a weekly basis (I've increased the weights since I've started) and am still loving it! I get comments on my arms at least 1x per month (usually more) and I swear it's because I do this video.
1,Save the money even if it's cheap,"One of the worst movie quote books I have read. To cheap to return, guess I can use it as scratch paper LOL, if you want a so so movie quote book, here it is folks...best go for free shipping cause it sure is not worth it...Boring too."
4,"okay, but....","This is a great box set, with a few flaws. For one, it doesn't include full albums. There are only parts of it. I usually like to buy full and complete albums because there might be songs that aren't in box sets like these. Now I can't buy the full albums because I already have 1/2 of it, it just wouldn't be worth it. If you like the ""greatest hits"" idea for albums, you will like this box set. It's great and has all the great songs. But if you like complete albums like me, buy them seperatly."
4,"Where is ""OHIO""","Where is the song ""OHIO"" ? Of all the songs they left out ,this should not have been one of them. It was the only single they ever did that was never on an album (except ""SO FAR "" greatest hits) But the rest of the unreleased songs are nice to hear.There could have been a few more of these,and less of the already released album fare."
4,CSN Set: Sums up the groups torrid history,"The Boxed-Set is one of the rare over-views that provides enough surprises for even the most passionate fan. By using both solo, Crosby/Nash, CSNY cuts the CD's have a real air of newness. The set only starts to weaken at the 2nd half of the 4th disc where the awful Live It Up shows up."
5,The most underrated film in the history of cinema,"I am proud of myself being one of the few audience who have actually seen this little gem at a movie theater in Westwood, California in the early 90s. This movie knocked me out. Totally original, actually this is the first film that I saw claimed to be a ""mocumentary."" I just loved it. One of the 10 best films on my list. I loved every actor in the film. If you have experience on movie sets, you will understand what this film is talking about. There are movies on Hollywood"" or ""filmmaking,"" such as ""The Player""""The Big Picture."" This one is better than those. Shame it's not available on DVD."
3,A bit too mature,"I thought this Alice book was a bit too mature for the age level of the readers, and not nearly as much fun to read as The Grooming of Alice. Plus it seemed more preachy than entertaining."
2,Well written with disturbing concepts,"I flipped through this book at the library and, while impressed with how well written it was, I was disturbed by the nonxchalant, almost flippant, attitude towards premarital sex and lesbianism. It goes against everything I've been taught. If you want a well written and politically correct book, spring for this one. If you want a wholesome an morally correct book(also well written) spring for something by Stephen Bly or Lori Wick. BTW, I'm a teenager, so don't try to say that's the opinion of an old prude."
3,disappointed,"This was definately not one of the best alice books, i think that it was all alittle too exaggerated; from the discrimination week to alice's lesbian friend being bullied. The way that Alice adressed the situation of homosexuality disturbed me, I dont agree with homosexuality and was disappointed to find that Alice backed it up 100%, by the world's standards it's ""natural"" but morally, i believe it's wrong. When Alice ponders the thought of being a lesbian, she thinks to herself that it's something that you just cant help, as if you were born with it, but there isn't even a shred of medical evidence that proves homosexuality is hereditary or a trait! I really think that someone like Alice would pick up on something like that instead of going on with what the world thinks is right. Overall, the book was entertaining, but has some questionable content."
2,ehhh...,"well, i was dissapointed to say the least. i was expecting a high quality documentary. i have been waiting forever to get documentaries on these heroes of our faith, but i was disappointed when i got the dvds. all it is, is Roberts Liardon standing there talking. the entire time. just him, poor quality.but it did have some good info. which gives it 2 stars."
2,Not one of their best products,"First, I'd like to say we love the color wonder markers and the fingerpaint. This product has the soft sticks that are almost like the waxy finger paints in a stick form. Think of your child using a chapstick to draw with and you'll get the idea. We purchased two of these for our 5 year and 2.5 year olds. From the minute they opened it, the waxy ""paint"" part of the sticks were breaking off. It became almost impossible to draw with these sticks and my children were very disappointed with them. They did love the coloring books that came with this kit and went on to use the books with the color wonder MARKERS (which I highly recommend.) That said, it's too pricey for just the book and a shame the sticks don't work better. Please save your money on this one and go for the Color Wonder Markers or Fingerpaints instead."
4,Good Enough,IS really a good product and very effective for the purpose of storing information but have to be made a little bit cheaper for so many people to be able to afford it. And also needs advertisement for the public to know about the product in the market. I will say generally that the product is good enough the purpose for which it was made for.
1,POORLY MADE - not worth the risk,"My experience was similar to other reviews: the thing came apart from its casing and poof - there goes all that data. It's not the cost of the device, but the horrible hassle of losing access to your data. There's no warning. I think the plastic or poor construction just breaks. Will never buy PNY again!"
4,It Ain't as easy as the instructions lead you to believe on Windows 98SE,"All the files required were not downloaded from the PNY website.. It also takes WinZip to unzip the files.. It took 4 emails to tech support to finally get all the files required to load the driver... The instructions are as clear as mud to the 'average' computer user (as myself). But, finally, I have the device working....At least now, I am able to move files from 98 to my new XP machine...A 'thanx' to tech support guy, Rafeal, for all his help.."
2,1/4 FAILURE,"I bought a few of these to distribute at my work office. i bought a few of the double packs and gave them out. one of which came back with some corruption after it was showing some slow transfer rate. not sure what to say about the quality. it seemed pretty sturdy since it was encased in some thick plastic. but if the hardware is any indication, i dont think id trust the rest of the batch i bought for my office."
3,nice piece of work,I use these for my embrodiery machine and it is so cool to see how fast they transfer. My Grandson also needed 1 for school but has not used it yet.
1,Dead on arrival,"I ordered one of these based on the price, it came dead on arrival. Returning for refund and going to try another brand."
2,Good device.. bad wrapping..,"I like the fact that u can secure the drive on ur key chain. A lot of USB drives have the loop on the cap but anyone should tell u that isn't an optimum solution. Anyway, the plastic casing is loose now and everytime i take it out of a plug, there is movement inside the case. it is only a matter of time before the device stops working right. I am resolved to never get another flash drive with a plastic casing again.. Maybe I am too cheap.."
1,DO NOT BUY PNY!!!,"Stay away from PNY products! I bought a PNY Attach Flash Drive a few months ago, and not only is it poorly manufactured (flimsy plastic case, very loose fitting, cheap looking...), but they do not honor their rebate offers! Stay away!"
1,NOT as Advertised,"This item was advertised to be Ready Boost compatible.I bought, try it and it isn't."
2,Stopped working,"I've been using this flash drive for about 6 months. It worked just fine going between Macs and PC's. I only used it for backing up, so it wasn't on a day to day basis. Then the other day it just stopped working. It would show up on the computers but you couldn't even access it to reformat it. I took it to get looked at and I was told it's dead and there's no way to retrieve my information. It hangs up in my office, I don't even carry it around in a bag or anything so it didn't get banged up or left out in the cold. It just died! When I replace it I will get a different brand."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,PROS:QUICK SYNC TIME (I ONLY DO 10-20 MB FILES SO DONT NO ABOUT LARGE FILES). NICE LIGHT WHEN IN SYNC.CONS:FEELS CHEAPLEY MADE SINCE IT'S ALL PLASTIC. ALSO IT'S PRETTY BULKY FOR A FLASH DRIVE.
1,Not very good,"If you see 'infinite-surplus' as an approved Amazon vendor, do not buy from them. After ordering with expedited delivery, after a month, all I get is an offer to refund my money."
2,Several typos and other problems with the text,"I'm only a few chapters into this free Kindle version of this title and have already noticed the following problems:- Every phrase or word that is italicized in the original text is rendered in ALL CAPS in the e-book. This is incredibly annoying to me - it feels as though Wharton is shouting at me, when we all know she would never do such a thing :-) She is much more subtle than that!--Every time Undine's name should be followed by a comma, it's followed by a period instead, thus bringing the narrative to a dead (and incorrect) stop.--Typos are starting to appear, such as ""Mrs. Fairford"" being typed as ""Mrs. Pairford.""If this kind of thing doesn't bother you, then this will probably be fine for your Kindle, but if you find these issues as annoying as I do, you may want to look around to see if spending a few dollars will get you a cleaner version of this classic."
2,Disappointing,"Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one."
4,Overkill's best,"This album is a must for any serious metal fan. Like Megadeth's Rust and Metallica's Justice, Horroscope represents the band at the top of its form. The group emphasizes composition rather that pure speed (although there is plenty of speed) but has not yet fallen into the dull and whining stage represented by their next album or the anger for the sake of pissing off your parents stage represented by their recent efforts."
4,"Great Workout, Just Watch the Hamstrings!","Ellen Barrett leads a great workout that is suitable for both beginner and intermediate levels. This workout makes me feel like I've been working very hard, and I love the way she makes the poses flow together. The only thing I don't like about this workout is that she never has you stretch your hamstrings afterward, so they'll feel sore the next day if you don't add a stretch."
5,love it,love this video. love the way it combines yoga and pilates. I feel so good and like I got a good workout everytime after using it. I enjoy high impact cardio most of the time -running and eliptical- but i like to take a break from that every now and then and do this video. very good.
4,Better than expected,"The Crunch-Super SlimDown video was very easy to follow. I was able to keep up right away but after doing the exercises, I could tell very quickly I was going to get results from it."
3,"Large face, good accuracy, but too long","This thermometer is about average. The large dial is well marked and provides a high degree of accuracy, but the numbering and lettering use an unnecessarily small font for such a large face. The temperature reading seems very accurate when I compared it against other frothing thermometers. The primary drawback I found was that it is too large for a typical home frothing pitcher. With a six inch stem (actually slightly longer) plus the dial, it requires over 6-1/2"" of clearance to use. I find myself wishing it were shorter whenever I use it. Good value for the cost."
3,Disappointed,"This video really did not live up to what the title suggests.While it gave very thorough examples of massage techniques for loving couples, I would not have considered it ""Red HOT"" or ""Orgasmic"". It would be considered ""R"" rated if shown on TV, which it could be. I was expecting more."
4,Good Season but in my opinion ... not the best,"See what I don't like about this DVD is that I didn't care for Glory ... Even though it was the Only Single Working Big Bad that was a woman which was cool I didn't care for most of the episodes.I think I might have to watch the season againI can't wait until Season 6 and 7 come out on DVD because they've ALWAYS been my favoriteThe Gift is a great episode but episodes like No PLace Like Home , Shadow , Triangle , Checkpoint and they just don't cut itOther ones ( great ) that are < like Buffy V.S. Dracula , Real Me , The Replacement , Out of my Mind , and Fool For Love are great.The Last couple episodes of season five are great too like Tough Love , IntevenTion , Spiral ... great , really goodOverall I guess it's a really great season but some how does not compare to the other seasons ( 7 , 6 , 3 )"
5,The Slim Set is much cheaper,"Anyone thinking of ordering this should considerBuffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Fifth Season (Slim Set)instead. The discs are exactly the same and the only difference is that the DVD packaging is a Slim Set. Slim Sets are thin cases (about half the width of a regular DVD) that don't contain the booklets you usually get with DVDs. Those bargain DVDs you see for $5 at the store are usually sold in slim sets. Otherwise, you are paying way too much for this product.If you're trying to get the entire series of Buffy, go withBuffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)"
5,Can you say ... Awesome?,"The only word that I have to describe this Buffy season, is. . . .Awesome. This is definitely one of my favorite seasons. The comedy and drama are both much better then the first four seasons, and the first four were very funny and dramatic. One contribution to the funny would have to be the full time character of Anya. The DVD screens and menus are all very nice. I would recomend this dvd collection to anyone who likes buffy as much as I do."
5,a epic season,"There is no bad season of buffy. All seasons can be rememered for diffrent reasons and are all great in their own way. The last three seasons (5,6,7) are my personal favorites, becase the writers and actors made it much deeper, darker and more meaningfull. That's just the type of person I am, I like deep metaphors and darker plots. This season started off happy and light hearted much like season 4, but as more plot twists developed it got darker. The acting was supurb and the writing was byond good. Glory was good, not as good as the mayor or angelus/dru/spike. I don't see why people always rag on the later seasons, because they are just as good if not better. I don't really care if you buy it, but it needs some defending. Eeven if you don't like this season it's still better than anything (except maybe angel) on tv."
3,BtVS Lives Forever!,"Gentle Readers:Buffy is the best show in the world, and if you don't already know that, you have been missing out on life for the past seven years. Season five is probably my favorite because a lot of discoveries are made: Dawn is the Key, Glory is a God, and Ben is..well..he's a confusing guy. Look forward to lots of laughs, apocalypses, and death. This is, after all, Buffy. As a dedicated, loyal ""buffaholic,"" I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys action, sly humor, drama, and romance all spun together. Buffy will go down in history forever as the show that broke all the rules, and what better way to re-live the memories? Go ahead. Don't be afraid. Buy Season Five...you won't regret it!"
3,Annoying!,"I cannot stand the introduction of ""Dawn"", or ""Glory"" for that matter. This was not the best season of Buffy for me. Loved season Six!"
2,yeah,Worst season yet.I don't mind dawn. I'm not a Dawn hater. I hated Glory.A villian so card-boarded that Adam looked like a real winner.The only reason I could stand this season was the drama in The Body. That episode saved this season.
3,MEDIOCRE SEASON..wonderful ending...Season 6 is better,"Season six is a lot better because it becomesdarker in exploring rapid maturity and lust.Season five however is vital in developing this.Spike finds love that will eventually leave himheartbroken and buffy draws closer to pain.LEAVE Xander ALONE, people get fat, so stop makingfun of him, OK? The finale is important in lettingyou know the loyalty between spike and buffy nomatter how much friction there is. If you are anavid buffy fan, purchase season 5 , if not....wait till season 6 and buy that.....season 7 is apoor storyline and very boring but all the otherseasons are worth purchasing. Pleasebuy season six , THE MUSICAL IS FANTASTIC."
3,i'm confused,"Pretty sweet album. If you like weezer, you will like special goodness. So I bought this album last year. Now I see it is released again? A different album cover and the songs are in a different order. Did they get a different record label or what? Anyways, good album."
1,Good recipes - but very inefficient.,"Children love to follow instructions, step by step, and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep, drag on for hours. Any adult, who cooks like this doesn't cook often, cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen.For example, who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter, melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic, microwave safe) mixing bowl? Great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! It is a children's cookbook, so why not cut down on time spent with knives, stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave?Nice pictures, large font, recipes are great, but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen, not a home."
4,Pat is back,"Gangsta Pat is a very talented artist.As well as being a top line rapper he makes all his own beats.The album i got before this Pat changed his style to rapping very fast like bone thugs or skinny pimp,but here he went back to his old style of his first two albums-he basically like a west coast gangsta rapper but with a southern flavour and accent.The lyrics here are very good and his flow and beats cant be faulted-the reason i give it 4 is that for me the album was a little long-the last 4 or 5 songs he had already covered that stuff earlier and the beats for those songs were nothing special.Like the other reviewer here says Pat just needs better promotion-i guess most people either dont know about him or just havent heard him-this would be a good introduction album."
5,Highly recommended,"I discovered this book from a recommended reading list and I love it. the writers style really connects you with the main character. I'm now reading ""the Howling Miller"" and they are both equally excellent."
4,Good Holiday Movie,Great movie for laughs during the holidays! Danny Devito is his classic self and he reminds you of that annoying neighbor who goes way beyond necessary decorating of their house at Christmas.
1,Bad Casting,On what planet would Kristin Chenoweth be married to a troll like Danny Devito. My suspension of disbelief can only be stretched so far.
1,Awful,"Its October and Halloween has not passed, yet everyone seems to be getting ready for Christmas. My mother bought this film and i've never watched it, so I picked it up and watched it. Oh my god, what a piece of crap! The story is beyond stupid and the acting was bad. I stopped this film halfway thru and downloaded Frank Sinatra's A Jolly Christmas instead. Avoid this movie if you want to have a Merry Christmas."
1,A Waste of Time,"What a waste of time & talent. I usually love Chrismas movies, but this one totally misses the mark. DeVito is missing his signature wit. Broderick looks constipated. The wives & kids might as well not even be in the movie considering the input they were allowed. The plot was choppy & just didn't make sense at times. It had none of the uplifting scenes you expect from a holiday movie. Save your money."
1,Christmas movies suck!,"Holiday movies like ""Miracle On 34th Street"", ""It's A Wonderful Life"", and ""A Christmas Story are not classics because they cannot match the holiday spirit that is found in the movie of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". So ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!This movie is a very bad movie. it's about two guys who don't have a life, a girlfriend, and no hope. One day one decides to have the lights seen from outer space. The acting is bad, the set design is lame, and nothing can even save this movie from being a total disaster. Next time you want a Christmas movie, then get the movie of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". You have been warned!"
3,reasonably entertaining,"This is a brief diversion with many physical hijinks involving a new neighbor obsessed with having a ton of Christmas lights on his house, much to the dismay of the fellow across the street. Standard holiday fare, worth renting if you are in the mood for a lighthearted comedy and not much more."
2,Not so good,"For me, I am okay for this movie. It is just a typical Christmas movie. The acting is just the worst part of the whole movie. It is because they are kind of exaggerating. There are some other Christmas movie that I saw before were better than this one. Overall, it is okay."
3,Deck the House with Bright Lights,"When I saw the reviews here I rented and didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. This is as good or better than most the latest holiday fare out there. In a nutshell Devito moves to Broderick's neighborhood and takes over with his friendliness and Christmas lighting. Broderick tries to strike back but things don't go as planned for either of them. Some hilarious moments as Devito tries to make his lights visible in outer space. Overall a funny family movie if you enjoyed ""Christmas with the Kranks"" or ""Jingle All the Way"". Decent quality DVD with no extras. I wouldn't pay $19.99 for it, but $9.99 wouldn't be out of line. Reasonably replayable Christmas movie."
2,Movie goes nowhere with no laughs,"The movie has a fast paced beginning and feels like a decent promise.However, absolutely nothing humourous happens, and there are tons of non-sequiters. The script gets very lazy and just hops from one scene to the next without rhyme or reason. Broderick sleep walks and Devito is rusty.A big disapointment!"
4,Cute illustrations,"Not my all-time favorite, but still a fun read that my two boys (ages 4 and 6) enjoyed immensely."
2,dismal,don't get this. just watch the fight scenes on youtube or something. a big fat waste of money.
4,Summer-Bastardos!,"This very well could be the oddest album in the Blue's Traveler discography. Jay Bennett (RIP ,brother) produced the album Bastardos and to my ears, made a Blue's Traveler version of Summerteeth. Perhaps i'm being too kind as i think Summerteeth is one of the amazing albums of our lifetime....BUT you can tell hear Jay Bennetts influence all over this album. Definitely the most ""pop sounding"" album by Blues Traveler, if you are interested i'd recommend going to their site as you can listen to their albums in their entirity and thusly get a feel for it.A way different vibe for them, sometimes it works wonderfully and other times not quite as well as i would've hoped. Still, with a band as talented as BT and a producer who was as talented as JB, it has some fine highs!"
2,Their worst album to date,"I own all of Blue Traveler's studio albums, own some of their live stuff, and have seen them live. I would consider them among my 10 or so favorite bands, so it pains to be say this -- but this is a horrible album. I keep thinking that I need to listen to it a little more to give it another chance, but frankly, I'm not sure it's even worth it. What surprises most is that the album directly preceeding this one, ""Truth Be Told"" is among their very best work. I'd love to write a glowing review for one of my favorite bands, but I can't. If you're looking for a BT album to start with, don't begin your adventures with the band with this album."
1,Dont waste your time,Save your money if they are playing in concert in your town. Last summer they played at a benefit concert for kids with cancer and then played afterwards in town for half the cost. Just check out the local listings for a band called John Popper and friends....The music is dated so you dont want to pay full price to hear them play.
3,its ok,"This book wasnt really that helpful, but it was just ok. There was nothing new in it that I didnt already know. but if a person doesnt know alot about couples and positions then this is the book to get."
5,Very helpful.,"Please note that this book has an intimate chapter in the back. That said, do NOT give it to a younger artist. Otherwise, this book is a godsend.I never eally knew how to draw characters close together, resulting in single shots and stand offs. This book helped me with those and start drawing couples so they look more real. Hints like slowing how far to extend the arms and shoulders to change it from a nice walk to a tense one, and how to draw two people of different hights look normal next to one another can help anyone. All in all, one of my favorites."
5,Highly recommended,"This is an excellent source of information and inspiration for anyone who is dealing with cancer as a patient, friend or family member. I have given this book to countless friends and clients and received positive feedback from many. Vickie Girard provides hope and so much more. Recommended reading for anyone who has been touched by this terrible disease."
4,Great word game,"Trhyme is a fun word game where you are given three desriptive phrases, and you have to come up with 3 words that all ryhme. It is more challenging that I thought. It is easy to get on the wrong track where you can come up with two of the words, but not the third because the correct answer is a totally different rhyming scheme! I recommend this as a great family and friends Game Night game!"
1,Kiss [your money] goodby!,"Keep it simple stupid refers to the writer of this volume, not the buyer. Levin seems to think he is a 'wit' of some sort, a title he claims without cause. The book is full of un-illustrative cartoon characters, way too much fluff and not enough information. Look at the table of contents and see if you can determine what is in each chapter. Look up 'keyboard' and he'll describe it for you, but you will not see a picture. He wastes a page on the Trojan horse, more wasted on Alice in Wonderland, the number of times the human heart beats over a lifetime... great time wasters, but not very informative. The author thought his job in writing was to occupy the time of those with too much of it. I bought thinking I could solve problems - all I did was create another. I should have smelled a rat when I found out that ""Troubleshooting"" isn't even listed in the index."
3,"Two CDs, one a waste of plastic","CD1 (Assault, Baby Anne) has some good Florida Bass on it. I liked the mix of Freaks Groove (Track 2). Not really what I call breaks, but still worth the money.CD2 (Battery, Jen Lasher) is exactly that. Battery on your ears. It sounds like someone took the sound of the 80s and made it worse (if that were possible). I don't like her style. She has a pretty voice (heard on Track 11 and some others), but her music is...well.....stupid.Also CD1 has some sort of copy protection on the last track (track 14) that kicks in around 1:15 into the track....keeps me from loading the CD onto my Ipod. Stops my CD-Ripper dead in its tracks. Plays fine on a regular Car CD player though, but not in my Clarion AutoPC, and not in my xBox."
5,WOW I'm in Heaven,You can always count on Baby Anne to bring the funk. Assault and Battery is no exception. What's great about this cd is that Jen Lasher steps up and brings a solid mix also.Highlight tracks:Baby Anne - She's the DevilMylo - Drop the Pressure (Future Funk Squad Mix)Baby Anne - DementiaJen Lasher - No More TearsThis is a must have for anyone breaks fan!!!!
4,Great,"I had the gloves for about couple of months now and they're still in great shape. There might be other gloves out there that go for a little bit less, but if you dont mind spending this much, then go for it. It's money well spent, at least for me that is."
2,I tried so hard to like this book BUT IT WAS SO BORING!!!!,"I bought this book based on the story of Joe Simpson and tried so hard to like it, but I just couldn't. It had to be one of the most boring books I've read in a long time...No, correct that, I couldn't even finish it because it was so boring. I lasted about 80 pages and skimmed the other 20 and just wanted the book to end....The book started out okay but once the two started climbing it became extremely repetitive....I just wanted the book to end...It was so damn boring! Great story (hence two stars and not one) but terribly written."
2,It reads like a hammy readers digest short story,Mountaineers who almost die - who cares! Why did they climb the mountain in the first place...to have an interesting anecdote to bore their friends with.
4,Touching the Void,"This is a real page-turner. Despite the fact that you know the outcome of this story, Joe Simpson takes you with him on the impossible journey. You'll have no trouble making time to read right through this exciting book."
4,Harrowing is right,"This book made me claustrophobic just reading the back cover-surviving falling into a crevasse-are you kidding me? Aack! This was a great book. It keeps you gripped throughout. I have to say though, I got a little irritated with the constant reference to ""the voice"" towards the end of the book. Also I felt a little cheated with how the book ended. I wanted to know more about the physical and mental recovery of both men-but the book ends rather abruptly with little details of what happened after they left the mountain."
4,Deliverance from Death,"I picked up this book because Oprah Winfrey recommended it. By the way, Oprah has done more than many educators have for literacy and good reading than anybody in this country.This is a true mountain adventure set in the Peruvian Andes. The two climbers are skilled and courageous. The book is well-written, with vivid details and a life-and-death ethical dilemma at its center. How Joe Simpson pushed himself past the limits of endurance is compelling. My only disappointment is that he failed to see the hand of God in his deliverance."
1,spanxx,"I've heard so many good things about this product from friends and even celebrities. Sorry to say it didn't do wonders for me, maybe because the seller sent me the wrong size. I asked for one size and they sent a smaller size. I have decided never to order any clothing off the internet again. It was a total waste of money. I was so hurt. They couldn't even get the order right. I tried to fit into it as I had an affair to attend that night and sadly to say it ripped in half! I will never order any clothing from the internet again especially hosiery! Thanks alot to the idiot who sent me the wrong size!"
2,For kids only,"When I was a little tyke, I loved the ""Inspector Gadget"" cartoon show, with it's clever animation and slapstick.I missed the first Inspector Gadget, but I saw plenty of trailers and commericals for G2.And from those trailers and commericials, I pretty much figured out the whole movie.Goofy Old Cop blows something, gets replaced by the New Cop. New Cop is aloof to Old Cop, who is trying to get back into the graces. Old Cop finds New cop attractive. Big Bad Guy comes in. Sweet Innocent is kidnapped, and Whole City at risk of Big Bad Guy's new weapon. New Cop and Old Cop team up, defeat Big Bad Guy, Sweet Innocent saved, and they live happily ever after. New Cop and Old Cop have a Sweet Kiss.Yeah, adults really won't be too impressed, but their kids will love it, until they figure out simple-minded movies like this too."
5,Great -- much better than the original!,"Everything about this movie surpasses the first one. It's funnier, it's faster, and it's much more interesting. French Stewart was perfect as Inspector Gadget. I like Matthew Broderick in many roles, but Stewart shows he really knows how this part should be played. In many ways, this sequel is much more faithful to the original cartoons than the first film, making Claw more interesting and the whole film more enjoyable. The effects were top-notch and they were matched by the script and the very talented, well-chosen cast. I can't say I liked the first Inspector Gadget film, but I really enjoyed Inspector Gadget 2."
3,Bold claims with no justifications,"In the beginning of the book, the author claims that his book is intended for the casual reader rather than an academic reader. However, the conclusion he makes in the end and the methodology he used to reach his conclusions are flawed.As an observer or casual writer, a writer's merit decreases significantly when he makes bold statements without any backing or evidence. For example, it's surprising that the author claims that Cordoba was not such a great city, contradicting most of the academic studies in this field.I was more surprised when the author only glimpsed over the Inquisition and no details were provided.And lastly, how could an author write about Andalusia without referring to any historical Arabic books written in Andalusia in that period? His only reliance, it seemed, was on books written by few monks or abbots. This is a biased approach."
5,One of the best books I ever read and will read again,"Oh how I loved this book. The story is a typical one - a rich girl falls in love with a poor servant, her parents will never accept it. The characters are built up so nicely that by the end you're just aching for them to be together. It's a sweet and innocent romance and the ending is super exciting. Here's some advice - buy this book and read it slowly to enjoy every page (and grab a box of tissues for the teary parts!)"
5,Touching and entertaining,"I like this book so much that I have read it more than once. Lorna is a rich girl who falls in love with Jens, the kitchen handyman. When Jens is commissioned to build a boat for Lorna's father, her love of boating has her spending a lot of time with Jens. Before long, they fall in love. But all is not smooth for these lovers as her parents forbid her to see him again.I really liked these characters. Although Lorna was rich, she was not spoiled, and I thought she had some very real qualities. I loved Jens. He was masculine and tender and intelligent and simple. Another winner from Lavyrle Spencer."
5,What a wonderful story,"Such a sweet and romantic story.I laughed, I cryed, I hurt and I rejoyced at Lorna's and Jens's happiness (and I'm 53....)This writer is fantastic!"
5,A Touching Love Story From the Past,"A rich girl falling in love with a handy-man in the l9th century is immediate attention holding as the two try to cope with rejection, separation and denial of a love they can't escape. The conflicts are many and the struggles are numerous for these likable characters. A believable and worth-while read from my favorite romance author.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"
5,GRAVIOLA IA A VERY EFECTIVE PRODUCT,"ME SIENTO MUY AGRADECIDA DE HABER COMPRADO LA GRAVIOLA, HE COMRADO VARIOS FRASCOS POR SER MUY EFECTIVA Y LOS HE DISTRIBUIDO ENTRE MIS AMISTADES. RELAMENTE LO RECOMIENDO"
1,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,"I heard graviola was good for cancer . I took religiously for months. Save your money. This, in my opinion is a waste of money ,and using false hope as a sales tool. The seller was fast with order , just don't order this. TASTES LIKE CRAP.Bladder removed 2012.. it's your money!"
4,Two all-star groups pioneer new styles,"Twenty years ago two groups formed in Puerto Rico: Truco, led by Hector Valentin, played the traditional Puerto Rican styles of bomba and plena; Zaperok was formed in the early 1980s and pioneered the new style Songo.Their union fuses powerful rhythmic patterns from a range of traditions, creating new styles and improvisations which are lovely representations of infusions of all styles."
3,Delivery was made within promised time frame,"Was pleased with delivery service but wuld have preferred Jersey with Steeler logo. In my opinion the one I received is not a ""true replica""."
4,The whole crazy thing,Good CD but not his best. I've been looking forward to new music from Keith for a while and now that it is here I wish he had worked on it a little bit longer. Sorry guy not your best work. And the cover left me wondering where the funeral was. I sure wish you would let those beautiful eyes smile.
3,Great voice...but,"I love Keith Urban, but this is the first album I've purchased of his. I love ""Stupid Boy"" along with a number of others, however some of the songs just didn't really do much for me. I was just a tad disappointed. It was a good album but not a great one."
2,Disappointed,Poor quality videos with interviews in the middle. Best songs are interrupted. Some bands are just not meant to be heard live. Overpriced. Don't buy it. Rent it first.
5,For any coach,"As a former Pete Newell, Jr. player, I eagerly anticipated the printing of this book. I had heard plenty about his father that I knew he was not only a ""Good Man,"" but a great man as well. Coach Newell, Jr. was my inspiration to join the coaching ranks, and still is. However, knowing your past helps you know your future. This book sheds light on, who I biasly feel is the greatest college basketball mind. In all the research and studying I've done over the years to prepare myself for coaching, I feel this book has given me so much more than what I have read to date. The book is enlightening, philosophical, saddening and amazingly funny. I recommend this for any college basketball fan or basketball coach. You won't regret it."
4,Ludacris lands out another block buster.,"Ludacris lands out another block buster.FLows at all times are great and funny at the sametime, which is hard for some rapper.Track with snoop ,makes this album well worth the price. Good tracks are stand up,eyebrows down,blow it out,splash waterfalls, and hardtimes. Its get a 5 out of 5."
3,Pretty Disappointed,"I waited for this cd for this album for over a year after hearing Luda announce it at a concert in the Summer of '02. The most dissapointing aspect of the album is by far the beats. They are way too complex and they suffer greatly from this. By far the worst of his albums. Best songs on the CD are Screwed Up, Hip Hop Quotables, Hoes in My Room, Teamwork, We Got(not even Chingy could ruin this song), and Eyebrows Down. After releasing this album 2 years after Word of Mouf I expected much more out of the quality songs department. The one thing this album has that his others don't have are funny skits, you get a chuckle out of every one. Pick it up if you're a Luda fan, but you still might be disappointed."
1,Disapointment,"This cd SUCKS! I use to like ludacris until this cd. I gave this cd to my friend because it sucked so bad, it almost depressed me :\ i would of gave it no stars but they wont let me"
1,Horriible compared 2 his other albums,"Sniff,Sniff whats that smell...not chicken and beer more like crap. This was the biggest let down since 50 cent's get rich or die tryin more like listen to this and cry trying. anyways he is still 1 of my favorites of all time but this album does not do luda any justice when people say he sucks."
3,Entertaining.....,"Ludacris has the distinction of being known as the funniest rapper in the industry. Songs like ""Hip Hop Quoteables"" are just that, quoteable. The album features Luda's now famous mix of dis tracks, hoe tracks, club tracks, and weed tracks. For the most part, nothing weighty or introspective just a lot of fun and a lot of funny rhymes. Songs like ""Hard Times"" wear thin, as well as the guest appearences, with the exception of Snoop. The beats are hit or miss on the album. Some beats are true bangers like the Kanye made, ""Stand Up,"" but some feel like cheap sounding Cash Money beats. ""Diamond in the Back,"" is the most surprising track, with his switched up persona. ""Chicken and Beer"" doesn't really break new ground for Ludacris, but if you like fun music and don't care about incredibly vulgar lyrics, this is for you."
3,Not as good as Word of Mouf!,"This cd is jusy lackin something. For one thing, the beginning tracks are hot as hell, especially the intro, blow it out, stand up, and splash waterfalls. Then it goes down with hard times, to ballady. Diamond in the back brings things back up, after that, the music and his rappin seem to get lost or just straight up lazy. Luda could do better next time."
2,not too good,"ludacris releases some ill singles in his day, but this cd really sux. im a big rap fan, dont think im sayin this cuz i hate rap, i like it, but ludas new cd is crap. every song is annoying and u will want to turn it off right away. what ever happened to the ludacris we all used tolove, ""southern hospitality""? we will never see him aagain, unfortunately."
2,Terrible.,"Let's be honest, Ludacris is a terrible rapper. He's only famous because he can say a thousand words in a minute. Unfortunately, he only knows like, 2 words. He only knows about 2 things, getting drunk & having sex. Well, that's all he talks about. It gets kind of old after the first couple of songs. It's CDs like this one that gives southern hip hop a bad rep. The ONLY thing that is DECENT about this CD are the beats. They're good, not even great, but not enough to salvage this terrible CD.If you're a true Ludacris fan (why...?!), you'll like this CD (it's a rip off of his others, just worse), because your ear is accustomed to the garbage, but if you're a true music fan, look elsewhere."
1,Rap SUCKS...PERIOD!,"Ok. What's the big deal about rap. Anyone can rap. It doesn't take any talent. Rock, Dance, Industrial, Metal..have better sound to it, more insterments, and are just better in every which way."
1,This album blows and so does luda,"This and all of luda's albums are all hype. To put it simply, Ludacris Cannot Rap. His beats are all repatative garbage and any true m.c. like guru, rakim, jeru or the gza/genius could kill luda in a battle without breaking a sweat. luda seems to love being rich because that is all he seems to rap about."
1,I give Him Props for Nailing Bill O'Reily but this Album is,Yikes elsewhere.Ironic that Luda teams up with Snoop Dogg whom I've said for years has been Coasting on a Pop Pass&hasn't challenged Himself in years&is just basically doing better as a Hook Artist than on His Own Albums overall what a waste? Luda has alot of energy like Missy&Busta but like them He goes on wya too long&just runs short on ideas after a while.I Respect His Hustle but I just ain't feeling the Album.But the get back on Bill O'Reily is right on time&Long overdue.
2,Worst Luda Album,"After Word of mouf, I couldnt wait for this cd to release. Word of mouf was the best album iv heard. Chicken N'Beer can't even be compared to luda's last joint. Stand up gets old quick . there aint no good beats or nuthin. ""Diamond in the Back"" is ok. I havent listened to the cd since I bought it. I'm waitin' for Red Light District to come out. Hopefully, Luda will come through on that. You wont miss out on anythng if ya dont buy this. If you havent already, get Word of Mouf. Thats money well spent. Chicken N' Beer is TRASH."
4,ChiCkEn N bEEr,"its good to see ludacris bring out his anger and diss on o'reilly. Many of the songs seem to be focused on him. snoop dogg also disses oreilly by callin him a ""faggot white bred chicken s$it ni&&a"". Overall the album was alright with track 16 with chingy and the intro track being the cds finest. screwed up is also a pretty hot track."
2,Eh.,"its decent. its no where near as good as Word of Mouf. It was a BIG letdown for me even tho i did notice before i bought it that ""Stand Up"" was an awful song.Would not recommend."
3,Ludacris/Chicken and Beer,"Ludacris is back again with his 3rd album.I guess it's pretty solid but it sounds like his other stuff.He dosen""t really get in to anything new."
1,Hiz worst,Ludacris ` good intresting rapper. but this cd is boring. Hiz otha cds are ok but dis is just 2 bad. i mean i hate dis cd! its borin. Horrable beats. Not funnay anemore. dis is the end for ludacris.
1,Rap SUCKS,"i would give it 0 stars but you have to give it one. how do people like this crap. ludacris is just another one of these crappy untalented so called ""musicians"" that are ruining music. music actually has music in it not just some dude talkin fast. I HATE RAP!!! can't spell cRAP without RAP."
2,C & B,"This cd is less than i expected. It was highly anticipated, and disappointing for the most part. The two singles, Stand Up and Splash Waterfalls are both good, but there aren't any other above average songs on the album. Burn a copy from someone or download the singles if either are possible, but don't bother wasting your money."
3,CHICKEN N BEER,"The mouf of da souf, Ludacris, is back with his newest album Chicken N Beer. This time around, there are not as many comedy stylings as on 2001's Word Of Mouf or 2000's Back For The First Time, this time, Luda brings the real (sort of) to his raps. Waging war against Pepsi guy Bill O'Reily on ""Blow It Out"" isn't exactly what i wanted from Luda. The club-banga ""Stand Up"" is a good track to add but is tired by now. The only tracks that saved this album from a 2or1 star review were ""Hoes In My Room"" and the sex-influenced ""Splash Waterfalls"". Sorry Luda, but get back on the ball or your gonna hav 2 ""blow it out ya azz"""
4,Another fantastic offering from EBTG,"Great mellow but catchy music, you'll be humming along halfway through your first listening. EBTG is one of the few groups I follow that can seemingly do no wrong. I've outgrown many of the groups I listened to 10-15 years ago, but EBTG is always relevant."
4,CAN'T GET ENOUGH EBTG!,"Having started with Amplified Heart in 1989, I have been a great admirer of this British Duo. I have purchased and consider each one of their subsequent releases to be in my top 20. Tempermental is incredible, but having just purchased Worldwide, I wondered what took me so long. ""Understanding"" and ""old Friends"" have been repeating on my CD all weekend, and my friends are hooked, I've taped it three times. If you are an EBGT fan, don't forget this often overlooked release."
2,Start building your collection with later works,"Having first heard EBTG's ""Apron Strings"" on the soundtrack to John Hughes' She's Having a Baby, I obviously was enchanted by Tracey's voice. However, I was never moved enough to purchase an entire album until 1994's breakthrough, Amplified Heart. This was followed up by Walking Wounded, and I think the duo has made a graceful entrance into the world of electronic pop music. So being a relatively new fan, I wanted to start building my collection and chose Worldwide. I was fairly disappointed. The album was recorded in 1991 and has an almost eighties, adult contemporary sound. The most recent two albums are better investments and sound more sophisticated. I'm looking forward to a new album, but can't recommend this to less than rabid fans of the group."
4,4x20 Scope Review,I have this scope attached to my AR-10. The optics arevery good - also the range finder for the price makes this an excellent light weight choice in an AR scope -It has the P4 styling and you are still able to use your fixed sights while mounted. Great quailty for the price!
2,"Not worth the time or money, very disappointing.","First of all, this is the first time I have ever been inspired to write a review on Amazon. I was utterly disappointed in this CD from an otherwise outstanding group. Their compilation with Sarah is wonderful and I think they tried to capitalize on that. It sounds like they spent about 6 hours in the recording studio and tried to put this album together quickly. I'm all for being spontaneous, but overall, this album sounded horrible. Don't get me wrong, I think the BNLs are ingenious and apart from the mainstream crowd due to their creativity and outlook on music....they just fell short on this Holiday Album."
1,One song was great,"I ordered this CD because I really liked their version of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen/We Three Kings. I was very disappointed that, other than that one song, there wasn't a song worth listening to."
2,Are you Kidding Me?,"I am a huge BNL fan. I have all of their albums and have seen them 3 times in concert this year alone. I bought this album the day it was released. It is terrible! It was recorded last May at Steve's (Page- Lead Singer) farm in Canada. It almost sounds like they were just goofing around and recorded it. I guess they weren't that concerned how bad it was because they knew at least their hard-core fans would buy it. For a band that hasn't exactly been climbing the charts lately, this is inexcusable. Even I do not play it. With all of the great singers who have recorded holiday albums, there is just not room in this world for one more schlocky holiday album. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,Bought the CD for one song and should have just bought a couple of the songs,"I like the Barenaked Ladies band; I've downloaded their music on my iPod (I don't download much). Someone made me a CD of Christmas songs and one song was Elf's Lament. I loved the song--lively, different and cute. However, the majority of the songs, in my opinion, have been better sung by others or are uninspired or negative. I was disappointed. To me, most songs went beyond ""alternative"" and ""unusual"". A couple of the songs (one with Sara McLauclan and Auld Lang Syne were nice to listen to. If you are looking for something VERY different from the standards, you might enjoy more of the songs than I did."
2,Looking for something different,"I got this befor previewing it. It was a letdown for me. I am a big BNL fan, I love most their stuff but this was just not that good. You can always pick it up as a novelty album."
1,ONE OF THE BEST BANDS...ONE OF THE WORST CD'S EVER,"I've never written a review on Amazon...I guess you can say I was never really drawn to do so. My wife and I looked store to store for this album for weeks. BNL is one of our favorite bands and we think their music has been genius up to this point. This holiday album is the most annoying and lame thing I've ever paid money for! Usually BNL gets away with lame and annoying, but not this time! The few original songs are decent, but all sound so mellow...borderline melancholy. I was excited to see what BNL would do to holiday classics...but they killed them. I'll be giving this album away as a White Elephant next year!"
4,"Fun, good guests","Leave it to BNL to do something original, fun and very catchy. Even the traditional carols have a fresh sound, such as the up-tempo organ/drum version of 'O Holy Night'. Best of the original stuff is probably 'Elf's Lament'. Michael Buble (before he was a big star) and Sarah McLachlan (while her star was still shining bright) guest. Might be a tad irreverent at times--but just a tad."
2,Disappointed,"After not finding this CD not in stock at any local stores, I thought it mustreally be good. We ordered it and was very disappointed that we did notlike more than a couple of their songs."
2,Meh,"I bought this because I love the ""we three kings/god rest ye"" song. Really should have listened to the rest. Was expecting a few recognizable songs...the ones that were they weren't singing...instrumental. Very blah"
1,Did not like at all,"Very surprised at the ratings on this book. I thought it was very poorly written and really boring. Actually, just the first 100 pages were boring, I gave up after that."
1,unexpected,I had gotten these on amazon ...glad they werent real expensive..throughout all of the descriptions it was never once mentioned that in tiny little print on the package that the wires contain lead and to wash your hands after every use. My child listens to her books on a cd player ..one of the reasons for this purchase..wouldnt recommend them.
1,"Terrible, poor quality","I purchased these earbuds back in March and barely used it for a month and a half until one of the earbuds was receiving bad feedback through the jack. I had to keep moving the jack around to get it to work. Sometimes it would go through, but most of the time it didn't.I'm very unsatisfied with this product! Only buy this product if you want to listen through one earbud."
3,no better then for what they cost,"these are your normal (really cheap) in earphones. dont expect to get anything more out of them then what youv paid for.first off the ""souond isolation"" is a joke: you can stick crayons in your ears and call it ""isolation"". these headphones are no more sound isolation then having water in your ears.and the sound isnt great eather. ITS TEN BUCKS. what are you expecting. the bass isnt strong (then again. you cant find heavy bass in earphones... its jsut how they are made. your expecting to have a 5 mm drum to rock your ears with heavy bass, when they cant produce that) (unless your buy some of the more expensive earphones). the sound on these are muffled. they are cheaply made. and not worth buying if you want something good.but if you only have 10-20 bucks to spend. these arent a bad way to go. just dont expect for them to be anymore then for what they are worth"
2,"Isolates little, plays poorly","My husband asked what was wrong with them, and the best description that I could give was that it sounds like I am listening to an old-time radio through these earbuds. I had the JLab D buds for more than a year and loved them; these were my back-up. For the original price (more than $20), these were more expensive, but the quality is horrible."
3,It's ok.,I bought these based on the good reviews and they were very good...for about 4 months. Then the right earbud gave out and now its just a piece of crud. They are ok but I would go with a different pair.
2,"Look yes, sounds great but falls out of the ear","I think the porduct has good quality but it you wear these to workout. Look else where, They feel out about 50 times during a 30 min workout! Very annoying I will not wear them again!! But if I was standing still the quality of sounds if very good. Disappointed :("
5,Best earbuds I have ever had!,"I have had several pairs of earbuds, I never liked the way they feel in my ears. They were never comfortable, until I spotted these and the price was fair, so I bought them. I absolutely LOVE them!! They are comfortable and they really do isolate noise! I hardly hear anything when I have them in. A must have!"
2,poor audio quality,"I bought 3 of these headphones based on the reviews. My son likes it when he is using it with the laptop. My sole use of the headphone is while I work out. Apparently these do not stay in your ears even for a minute. If you are running, you are better off putting them aside.The sound quality is so..so. As someone mentioned in the previous review, you get what you pay for."
3,alright,"the sound quality is okay with these but i really wish they had included different sizes of the rubber ear buds. they don't fit in my ears at all and i have to adjust them all the time to have true noise isolation. the bass is terrible; when i turn on the bass boost on my mp3 player, they sound like they're about to blow out. in any case, i only paid $5 so i got what i paid for."
3,found it for the same price the very next day after I bought it online.,I was bummed to find it for the same price in a store the very next day. So.....I could've purchased it at the store and not paid S & H.
3,"Very nice, worth the money",But it's not noise-canceling in any way. Very comfortable and you really get what you paid for!
2,ME NO LIKEY,Didn't like these very much. No comparison tho Sony's ear buds. Good thing I only spent $5.
4,"Great for the price; For sound quality, go with JBuds","I have a pair of JBuds for home, and bought a pair of these to take out, so I don't have to worry about breaking them. The sound quality is much better on the JBuds, but these aren't bad. Base is pretty good, but everything seems a bit muffled compared to JBuds.One cool thing to note - if you have pads from broken JBuds (like I did), they fit on these, so if you broke your JBuds and are replacing them with these, be sure to keep the pads, as these only come in one size, which is too small for me (or may be too big for your kids).Great value, but I can't give more than four stars with muffled sound."
4,Great Buy!!,"I trully enjoy the headset. Music sounds great, very nice base and a acoustic combo, no outside distraction. A must buy."
3,Doesn't fit comfortably,Decent headphones for the price but doesn't fit comfortably in my ears. They fall out easily when walking or biking. Wish I spent more money on better quality headphones.
5,Incredible sound quality for the price!!!,"This is the most comfortable earphones I've used (especially for the price I paid). The sound quality is excellent!! I will purchase an extra set, just to have. I definitely recommend this!!!"
2,Simply underwhelming,"I know not to expect much when not paying much. However, these headphones simply were underwhelming at every turn in my mind. They never seemed to have a very good fit, and the sound always left me wanting. I think the single earbud size fits all approach of this set is a poor decision, I have immediately noticed a more comfortable fit on the default swappable earbud of another similarly priced pair of Coby earbuds."
5,earplugs/earphones,"All I have to say is that for the price, they are great to use. I saw some lookalike earphones by sony that were >$30. Outrageous in my opinion.I was really surprised at how much they actually work like earplugs. A very nice feature to have while listen to music and such.The only thing negative I can think of is that from using these earphones, I am more self conscious on how clean the inside of my ears are every time I put them in. Hygiene definitely improved from product. Hope this was helpful."
3,just good for the price,"Not bad, but you have to be more careful since the cords might cut very easily!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap price, cheap sound. I think the cord could be longer. The bass sux! I'll just have to suck it up and get more expensive quality headphones."
4,Great value and quality,"These earphones are the best I've used. They are perfect for my ears and since the heads squish down, they can adjust to smaller ear openings. They also completely isolate sound. i haven't really paid attention to the bass specifically; what matters to me is the overall sound quality which is excellent. I suppose if you have ear openings that are above average, they may not be snug, but they definitely have a comfortable range to fit most people."
2,Below average,"I go through iPod ear buds far too quickly and am always looking for affordable ones. This pair was affordable but sadly the sound quality just doesn't come close. To me they are little different from the dollar store ear buds.JVC Jelly (I think that's what they were called) were quite good and you could get them for $5-$6 at Ross. Now I'm in Canada with no Ross. Anyone have good, affordable ear bud suggestions in Canada?"
3,Good for the price but not hardy,"I'm not an expert on sound quality but these were miles better than the crappy tinny headphones that came with my ipod, which was great considering I didn't want to pay much to replace them. They are very comfortable and block out ambient noise adequately, such that you only need to use a low volume setting to get a good volume of sound (nice on the eardrums).However, the reason I won't be buying them again is that they only lasted less than a year before they broke. Granted, I accidentally pulled on the wires a few times and I did wrap the headphones around my ipod (which I will not do in the future), but I feel like accidentally jerking the wires a few times should be expected. Even my crappy ipod headphones lasted longer (and those suffered much more pulling and tugging). I will be trying another brand, but if those break on me too I may get these again (because of the price!) and try to be meticulously careful with them."
1,Only lasted a couple months!,"I had read alot of reviews about different brands of headphones, like these ones. I decided to go with this one. They were great, until they just broke today. I first started using them in the middle of August. That is only 4 months!! That's ridiculous.I am going to see if they will take them back.What a bad product!"
2,muddy sound quality,"If I did not have an equalizer built into my Sansa Clip, I would not use these buds at all. Very muddy sound. Cheap but not a good value."
1,Expectations fell short,"My experience was literally the same as another reviewer that gave theCoby CVE92 Isolation Stereo Earphonesa one star rating.After three months of moderate use, I noticed the bass and sound was faint and in the right ear bud. Within a week of noticing this, the sound went out completely in the right ear bud and the left one was beginning to go as well.I find it hard to listen to music when you can only hear it through one ear. I threw them away and am currently looking to replace them with a more expensive set of earphones."
2,Sound quality is off,"Over 1k+ review of an item with a 3.5+ rating, I thought these would be great earphones, but I was wrong.I bought the earphones because my current HP earphones( which comes with the laptop I purchased 5 years ago ) and my Zune earphones are about borken.After I recived the earphones I tried them on(5mins ago): small and confortable, thumbup. BUT the sound quailty is way off. I compared with my HP and Zune earphones, I can clearly tell the difference. Coby earphones output ""high frequency"" sound, my rock music sounds like they are screeming at my ears. Same music same volume, my old Zune earphones sound way better than the Coby ones. I bought 2 sets and I will return them. Maybe they don't cost too much but what good I can get if I will never use them."
3,Still a good buy,"Overall sound quality is good. Only it fits poorly to me(not fit every ears). It tends to slip out of ears even when you sit quietly. Too bad, you can't test fit it before you buy. Hey, for five bucks, that's what the street vendor asks, but never sounds the same as this one. what a steal!"
3,Okay but broke quickly,"They are nice headphones, although be careful, when you get them the two stems are stuck together -- you part them by pulling them apart to decide how much separation you want between the two. I hadn't seen this feature before, and thought they were just stuck, and started pulling on them -- if you want you can pull them pretty much entirely apart right down to the plug. But after I started wearing them, I liked them. Except that I'm a heavy running, and somewhere along the way, one of the rubber ear buds popped off and that was that. If they're going to make these for sport use, they should be made a bit stronger. I owned the Sony's for two years and the buds are nearly inseparable from the headphone. So be warned."
3,Short life span.,"I bought these with theJBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black). The jBuds are almost twice the price and almost twice the sound quality. Given the price though, these are not bad purchases.Unfortunately they both have an average life span of about 3 months, though the jbuds may last a bit longer. One ear will stop working eventually for no reason I can think of. I bought these 3 times and the jbuds twice so I know what I'm taking about.To be fare, most head phones I've owned have lasted a similar length of time. In fact, I've never owned any (expensive or otherwise) that lasted more than a year.Bye 2 of these or one of the JBuds. Headphones don't last long enough to warrant spending more."
4,does the job,"They work well and do the job, they don't last that long but that is with the constant use of a 15 year old boy. Not sure if that,s the fault of the earphones or the user."
5,Great ear buds for the price,"Arrived quickly as described. Surprisingly cancel lots of outside noise. The sound quality is ok, but you can't expect anything better for earbuds. All in all great purchase, would recommend it for skiing and in office music listening."
3,Mediocre,"Eh... I don't have much to say about these headphones. They are cheap so that is good, but not that great of quality. I probably won't buy them again when they break in a year or so."
1,Don't buy,"The sound is fine for the price, but sound doesn't matter when they won't stay in your ears.Although it's cheap, it's a waste of money because I'm going out to buy new ones that I can actually listen to."
2,"Good sound isolation, but flat sound","Bought these as they seemed to be a good bargain and got pretty good reviews. While they really do the job with regards to sound isolation, the sound coming out of them is middling at best. While they do a decent job with bass (I'm not a big bass fan myself) the rest of sound is flat and lifeless. I would say the earbuds that came with my iPod actually sound better--this in and of itself, says a lot. Needless to say I will be using these to listen to sound coming from my computer, or maybe at the gym to help drown out the noise there, but they will not be used for listening to music through my iPod."
5,More Comfortable than I expected,"I went looking for a new pair of headphones after my original iPod ones died out. I use my iPod while working out 6 days a week (distance running and lifting) so I needed something that was comfortable, would stay put, and allow the music to drown out outside sounds. I've never used the ""bud"" style headphones before and was unsure how they would feel. They are extremely comfortable! The sound quality is also really good and for the price it can't be beat. I've used these now for over 6 months and I highly recommend these earphones."
3,Good for the price,"Not great sound quality and definitely not as good as some JBuds I had in the past, but for $5 the price is right"
3,"Highs are muffled, but for the money they are OK.","I purchased a pair of these for under six bucks and a pair of Skull Candy for about ten bucks in order to compare the two pair.The Coby pair has very muffled highs (cymbals, snare drums, etc.) compared to the ""bright"" Skull Candy pair. In general, the Coby pair just does not produce nice, clear sound when compared to the other pair. The Coby cost about half as much of course, but in absolute dollars spent the Skull Candy pair is a much better value.Some listeners might actually PREFER a muffled sound without the clear, crisp highs. For them, the Coby phones may be a good choice."
4,awesome value for only 5 bucks,"I have purchased this items from around 2 weeks and am enjoying it, the sound is good ( but a little low comparing to my old buds) so i need to increase the volume on my player to reach a good listening point.the material looks cheap but powerful enough to live for a decent period.for the sound, it's good with excellent range from treble to bass, and yeah the bass is good but not that much.if you have 5 bucks and need an earbud, go for it, if you can offer more, go for jbuds."
3,Okay...,"They're really comfortable and they don't fall out of your ears. These things are a plus, however there are flaws.I noticed that certain parts are louder than others by a lot. Often it's the drums and the bass. Vocals seem to get drowned out which is really annoying. I tried a lot of things to fix this problem including changing the equalizer on my mp3 player to no avail.Overall i'd say they're pretty good. Especially for the price. I wish the sound levels could be adjusted a bit more though."
3,Not exactly what I expected...Not noise-blocking!,"These were cheap and had a pretty good rating, so I decided to buy since my last pair of ear buds was destroyed by my kitten. I was under the impression that these were noise-blocking, but I was definitely wrong. They do not block any noise at all. My last pair had a sort of earplug material around each bud and worked great, these however only have a balloon of soft plastic that looks like some kind of cushion but is very thin. If you are looking for noise-blocking do NOT buy these. If you are looking for cheap ear buds that sound good but don't block noise, then go ahead and buy. ""Isolation"" is a total misnomer.They seem to be pretty good quality and sound good, but I'm not sure how long the balloon around each ear bud will last. The cord also seems to be pretty good quality."
5,Great Deal!,"I wear these while I'm at the gym so for watching TV and listening to music while I run they're great. I'm sure there are headphone out there with better sound, but definitely not for (...). These fit comfortably in my ears, unlike the standard ipod headphones and I don't have to worry about them falling out. Would buy again, for sure. :)"
2,Ear Buds,Product is OK for the price. The buds fall out of your ears occasionally and the sound through a Kindle is OK.
2,No good with iPhone,"These headphones do not work with my iPhone. The sound is so faint as to be useless. I can, however, use them with my Sansa clip. They work great with that device."
2,Not so happy with it,It's adequate for listenning though the sound is not the quality that I hoped for.
2,this product was crap!,These headphones were cheap and thats precisely why I bought them so I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. However these were the shortest lived earbuds I have ever bought. They broke within the first 3 months of me having them. I wouldn't blame the seller for this of course but I know I would never buy coby brand earbuds again.
4,Love them! Very comfortable.,The ones I got were just under $5.They block out noise pretty well. We were on a bus and my friend was starting to get sick from the bus music -- I had her listen to something on my mp3 player using these. Saved us! You can almost use them to block out noise without listening to anything -- note the word almost.They are also very comfortable. I don't want other earphones after using these. The comfort level on these spoil you for anything else.I can hear music fine on them.
5,Cheap and Works,"Coby Stereo Earphones / B000FOYMKUMy earphones always die within a year just from cord fatigue (wrap the cord enough times, the cord breaks) so I've stopped buying expensive ones. I've bought these twice in two years and been happy with them. The buds fit my small ears without trouble or pain, the silicone heads aren't itchy and don't flake or tear, and the sound is as fine as anything else I've tried. (Mind you, I'm not an audiophile.)~ Ana Mardoll"
2,Eh.,"They work fine. Not the greatest fit but what are you going to do? The reason for my low review is that the cord frayed and eventually separated from the connector with only a few months of use. I would not really label myself as a heavy user of this product, as it will rarely be plugged into anything else besides what's in my pocket and doesn't travel much from my table to my ears. Won't be buying another Coby product if I can help it."
2,Good sound in its short life,"So I bought this item as a temporary replacement of my lost earphone.In terms of quality, I wasn't expecting much from a low price earphone like this one. But once I got the earphone plugged into my ears, I realized how good the sound quality is. it actually sounds relatively good comparing to earphones with the same price on the market. Because of how good it sounds, I postponed my search of the real replacement.HOWEVER, 2 months after I purchased it, the right side stopped working.I already noticed some of the reviews complain on its short duration before I purchased it, so I used it with extra care.But it didn't work. Like it knows it's only a temporary replacement and it decided to suicide after a short period of time.There is not much I can say here except IT WON'T LAST.My conclusion is, you can get a sound quality that is better than its price. But the payoff is its short life.2 months and it's over."
2,great except for the windnoise,"The headphones worked great until one day I took them mountain biking, the wind noise was very loud, I can't figure out where it came from or anything, if I was looking straight forward, any speed over 5mph would make the headphones have a really loud wind noise, it did not happen if I turned my head either way. But it still makes them useless for what I wanted them, mountain biking, snowboarding, and running. So, if you want them for indoors, buy them, if you are going to use them outdoors, don't!"
5,Still in use.,"I didn't review this product immediately and bought it like 13874981723 days ago. However, I still use them and they work great. They aren't exceptional buy, hey, if you were looking for exceptional you wouldn't look at ear buds on amazon."
3,"not so great, better options for this price",I wanted sound isolating ear buds and these fit the budget of really cheap. Unfortunately the build quality is a result of the inexpensive price. I find that the wiring is very thin and build quality is lacking.
5,Great Sound & Great Price,"These headphones sound great, effectively block out outside noise and have a price tag that won't break the bank. I really couldn't ask for anything more."
5,Best Value Earbuds,"As many others say, these are some of the most comfortable earbuds around. While the sound probably won't win any awards, I think it's much better than most of the other cheap earbuds I've tried. Add to this the price, and you simply have the best value for any earbuds that I've found.These earbuds do have one downside. I'm on my fourth pair now as the wires tend to go on the fritz after a while. Perhaps I'm too hard on them, but for the price, who cares?"
1,Don't Bother,The earbuds are flimsy and will not grip the inside of the ear. I never bothered even pugging them in as they would not stay in my ears and were uncomfortable to hold in.
1,COBY EARBUDS,"I BAUGHT THE EARPHONES ON THE PICTURE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A REAL GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE, WELL THEY SHIPPED ME SOME OTHER MODEL OF THE COBY BRAND...(UNCOMFTORABLE) OLD FASHIONED EARPHONES AND SIMPLE! THEY WERE CHEAP SO I'M NOT EVEN BOTHERING TO RETURN THEM BECAUSE THEY WORK. DON'T ALWAYS TRUST THE PICTURE OR THESE REVIEWS..."
1,"These headphones are POS's, lasted two weeks.","+ The price- I bought two pair. The first pair lasted a week before the cap of one of the ear puds fell off exposing the actually speaker. Then I ordered another pair to replace the first. The second pair lasted two weeks before the left speaker went out, with the right speaker following it about three days later.Yes Cody has a manufacters warranty, but is it worth it? You decide."
3,overated,"Although I tend to agree with most of the other reviews that these headphones are quite comfortable to use, I nonetheless consider the overall sound quality coming out of them to be only okay. In short, I think that for the money they are really a good buy, but they should not be expected to compare with the ""better"", more expensive types, in terms of sound quality. As they say, you get what you pay for (more or less)."
3,good things don't last,"I bought this product on feb 14, and arrived a week later(feb 20th).. It was awesome! the sound and everything BUT it stop working about a week ago(March 12) today is March 19th and i'm very disapointed, i just got a similar one let's see how long this one last."
3,"Decent, for the price","I bought these after my previous pair broke. They sound good (I'm not audiophile, so the sound was more than adequate for my needs) and were comfortable. They didn't do as well blocking out outside noise as I had hoped, but for the price I was happy with them. Just a few minutes ago, they broke. I have come to expect earbud headphones to break after a while, as even more expensive brands I've used had this problem, but these lasted less than two months, which was somewhat disappointing. Now I'm going to look for another brand, that will hopefully last a little longer."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Save your money. Pick up a set of headphones on your next plane ride. 100% cheaper, same quality. These things suck."
2,"Well, my good luck with these just fizzled...are they different?",I have been buying these for years and since I go through about 5 a year (lose or brutally abuse them) I have always had a good few months with each. This most recent pair isn't as compatible with my Iphone...I keep getting pop ups on my phone stating as such.The device itself seems to be made differently and of poorer quality. Think I will try the other brands for a change...
2,Cheap products do not work well and cord has lead.,"Sound quality is ok, poor fit in ear canal (falls out occasionally while jogging), silicone bits easily detach from earbuds.The fact that this is a cheap Chinese product that contains lead on the wire makes using this product rather disconcerting."
5,Earphones,"Happy with my purchase. My husband used on the airplane, was skeptical about quality for the price and was pleasantly surprised. Said worked well. Great bang for the buck item. Packaged well; EXACTLY what I wanted/expected; and came in a timely manner. No squeezing butt during Xmas. Like shopping this way -- no surprises, no anxiety."
