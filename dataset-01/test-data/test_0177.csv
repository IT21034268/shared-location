5,Shockingly Refreshing,"To be perfectly honest, after hearing Pardon Me, Drive, and Stellar, I thought of Incubus as nothing more than Fuel with a DJ. Then I got my first taste of A Certain Shade of Green on the local radio station, and my view of Incubus was turned on its ear. Then, after some suggestions by my friends, I went out and bought S.C.I.E.N.C.E., and it really shocked me. The first song, Redefine, basically Redefined the image I had of Incubus (Pardon Me for the pun... oops, I'll stop it now.) After listening the whole way through, I had mixed feelings. Incubus had gone funk on me! Of course, I instantly fell in love with Nebula (you would have to be crazy not to want to wander off into a nebula at some point) and Favorite Things. The other songs, especially Redefine, took some getting used to. But there was a point that I just snapped, and now I can't listen to Pardon Me, Drive, and Stellar the same way. And that is one of my Favorite Things about Incubus. (Okay, okay, I'm done.)"
1,"THIS CD BLOWS #$%. do not get this if u like ""new skin""","this is one of the worst CDs i own. i got it cuz i really liked new skin on the family value's cd. there are only a few good songs on this cd but the rest is a load of @#$%. this was just a waste of money. i greatly advise u not to get this cd if u like ""new skin"" or any hardcore music such as KoRn, LB, static-x, coal chamber or any others for that matter. to sum things up THIS CD BLOWS!"
5,"Incubus, non-commercial","In the world of Incubus, this is how it is: Fungus Amongus:the talent album, showed us what they could do. S.C.I.E.N.C.E.: the very sweet and hard hitting non-commercial album. Make Yourself: the commercial album, got them noticed. Morning View: the crowd pleaser. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is by far the greatest incubus cd, no matter what anyone says. all of the songs are good, if i had to pick favorites I'd say new skin, a certain shade of green, and favorite things are the best songs on here. If you're looking for another make yourself or morning view, you wont find it here. what you'll find is a great funk/punk/alternative album loaded with great riffs and lyrics, that has turned into one of my all time favorite cds, and i hope it does to you. they are also awesome live and play a lot of songs live from this cd on the dvd, so i highly suggest that you pick that up, too."
3,Pretty Good Stuff,"I must admit, I bought this CD after hearing only 2 songs - Redifine and Vitamin. I had listened the hell out of my Limp Bizkit CD, and I wanted something new. When I heard the scratching guitars in Redifine, I thought that this CD had picked up where 3 Dollar Bill left off. Unfortunately, these two songs were the strongest on the CD (Redefine was OK, but I absolutely LOVED Vitamin). The CD really gets bad at track 4, but it picks back up again on 9, an interesting jazzy song. They get harder in Nebula, which I like, but then it drops off again. I have read the other reviews, and many people seem to love the whole CD, which is fantastic. I suggest listeneing to 5 or 6 tracks before buying. Who knows? You might love it."
3,A heck of a lot different from Make Yourself,"This is pretty good funkified metal (funk-a-fied? funk-i-fied?) Anyway, it's a good cd, and some of the songs (New Skin, Idiot Box,) are worth it. If you wan't to look back into their past from ""Make Yourself,"" check this out."
4,Protein Danger,A long overdue synopsis of literature elucidating the negative impacts of high protein consumption upon human metabolism.
5,Life Saving,I want to shout this knowledge from the rooftops so that I might save the lives of all that hear. This is the first review that i have ever written for any product but I was compelled to do this. In addition to the content the presentation is second to none.
5,Shocking book; quit eating anything with a face or name,"This is a long but very interesting book outlining 40 years of work by T Colin Campbell, scientist. The conclusions may be good. Unfortunately, I'm finding it impossible to actually follow them in practice. I'm a carnivore, face it, not a vegan. I think he is right, but sorry, I just can't do it."
4,Well written,"I'm only giving this 4 stars because I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking that this is ""statistics for dummies"". It hasn't been dumbed down any further than absolutely necessary to make it accessible to those with at least a decent high school education.On the other hand, each conclusion presented is supported and anomalies acknowledged. I find this refreshing because it seems like most publicly available scientific writing cherry-picks data to support a given conclusion and then shuffles the 'head scratcher' stuff into oblivion ... never to see the light of day.No guesswork here ... the less meat you eat, the better off you will be over the long haul."
2,Good science?,"Seems so convincing, but looking deeper I realize there are too many holes, incomplete info, assumptions,...look up the science reviews yourself, there is plenty of it out there."
4,Dietary guidelines re-visited,"This book presents a mountain of population data obtained in China comparing diet and health between people living in rural settings and those living urban settings. Further, it draws conclusions and makes recommendations on diet and health. The first part of the book presents the data and reaches reasonable conclusions, but the last part of the book decends into almost a polemic. Overall, I found it extremely well presented and informative."
1,Zero stars,The use of small samples without controls is the mainstay of this book. Judge for yourself.
1,Before you buy or read you should research,"An amazing deconstruction of the flawed use of statistics and the scientific method found in this book is here[...]How in could the funders of this project allow such a slip shod product to be constructed from the data I'll never know.the data should be released for all to see and run there own statistical correlations , by crowd sourcing the data we will limit the bias that can be present in the researchers"
5,WOW!,"This, by far, has been my favorite book about nutrition of all time. It can get a little technical at moments but overall it's easy to understand - and most importantly, it truly makes you think about what you are putting into your body. This book was the ultimate deciding factor in my fight to be vegan or not. Any worries I had about the vegan lifestyle were silenced by this book. I have already been recommending it to everyone I know!"
5,Life changing,"Great book, I've learned so much and have changed my eating habits considerably. Feeling healthier and better than ever. Wish I could get everyone to read it."
5,Life altering everyone should read,Life altering everyone should read. I intend to live a good long and healthy life and this book will help
2,Poorly written book,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have seen. It could have been written in 1/10 the amount of words. It is very flowery with tremendous amounts of useless background and extraneous information and just verbage. The book can be summed-up in one line: Eat fruits and vegetables (plant based foods), do not eat animal proteins (meat), and do not eat dairy products."
3,China Study.....an overkill,A well documented study by the author justifying the importance of a vegetarian diet. I feel the content of the text could have been reduced in half and still met its mission. I would support having the book included as a reading for high school and college students in their health and/or nutrition classes.
5,What everyone should know,"Great book by a qualified writer. Will give you a whole new slant on scientific evidence. Will give you the information to improve, prolong and perhaps even save your life for many years."
5,"A Must Read. Gather all the facts, including suppressed information...",Not only should the public be asking why hasn't the link between diet and disease been explored and explained; we need to be aware that many of these studies have been done! Now in one volumne a compendium of much of this research is available for the lay reader. The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition...lives up to its title. Highly recommended.
5,one of the most important books I've ever read,"This is an amazing book. Offering some of the best diet advice based on the largest study yet, the author also explains why we cannot separate out sound diet advice from extremely bad diet advice. I wish every person in America could read this book simply to understand the constant stream of misinformation that is being given to us, often from the sources we trust the most - doctors, medical schools, and government research studies. I am able to look at my Science News articles on conjugated linoleic acid and cancer-fighting beer and see how information is being distorted and fed to us at our own peril and the powerful food industry influences behind it. It is so hard to sort it all out, but this book does just that. The message is simple and clear. It has changed the way I look at ""health information"" forever."
1,It deserves a zero!,"This book was presented as a sort of vegan bible, I was a vegan then, I've benn for a little more than 10 years, a vegan who's always loved and studied statistics, so when I read it and searched the bibiographical articles, I discovered that the data has been interpreted in a wrong way, the way they wanted them to go, a way to make people believe that Asians eat a ton more soy than they're in reality and, worst of all, saying and underliyng that it's safe to eat it and that it protects from cancer, which is untrue and dangerous to say, a dangerous hype just like the agave nectar being safe for insulin resistant or diabetic people one."
1,Misleading,Not happy with this book. Saying it's merely misleading is being kind. Bad statistical analysis. Sorry I wasted my time on it.
5,Solid new information,"The best, most revealing credible book I have ever read on the links between nutrition, disease, and powerful special interest groups such as medicine, government, and the food industry. As a nurse, I thought I was well informed - well, I wasn't! Reading ""The China Study"" was a unique and very satisfying experience. Dr. Cambell reveals new concrete data that has drastically improved the quality of my life and health. I'm grateful that he had the courage to tell the truth about what goes on at the top. The facts he exposes are opposed to conventional propaganda on diet and disease. A must read! I bought copies for all my sons and daughters."
5,"Change your mind, change your life!","I have just finished this book, but I have been a vegan since chapter 3! I cannot express how my life has changed in that time. After 12 months of serious illness I have a new energy that I cannot explain. I am a nurse and thought I was knowledgeable when it came to nutrition. I can only say that I have had to completely rethink the industry lobby groups messages that have pervaded almost all nutritional information I have ever received. This book will not only change your mind on what a healthy diet is, it will change your life. Oh, and buy an extra copy .. you will want to give one to all those you care about! I don't believe I have ever read a more compelling book."
3,Statistics for health,Wow...this is dreadful dull reading. The information is important and well done but reading this is a task.
5,La gaia scienza,"This work of Nietzsche may be the most accessible for the casual reader. For philosophers and scholars, it may be one of the deepest. Many reviewers here have noted the ""God is dead"" stated for the first time in this book. To fully understand Nietzsche's perspective, and ""God is dead"" statement, one has to read deeper into - Heinrich Heine and his writings. Like Heine, Nietzsche does not write for the small-minded reader. This is why both of them are often misunderstood.""The Gay Science"" is also a magnificent literary achievement. This is the book to be read and re-read whenever you have a chance. The aphorisms are very well-suited for that but do not forget that all Nietzsche's writings are just the tip of the iceberg and that full appreciation comes from knowing them all (or most of them, at least)."
1,Beyond Poor Quality,Terrible quality dvd of a vhs transfer.Badly degraded picture very poor quality sound. Home made dvdr!!!!!I didn't know Amazon sold these kind of bootlegs??!Whitley's experience deserve better and so do those like myself who are interested.The link even miss spells his last name!!Beyond Communion - Whitley Srieber
5,Dutton's Nautical Navigation,"Excellent book for a quick consult and to know more about all nautical navigational issues..very easy to understand, good drawings and smart explanations ...For me the (nautical) bible onboard."
2,"Musician, not a Comedian","Eddie is a great singer, probably one of the most important soul singers of our times, but his comedy albums are just awful. Check out his musical releases, like ""Loves Alright""."
3,Funny!!! But Hard to Hear,"I loved getting this for Christmas, I really did! I had never listened to any of Eddie Murphy's stand up before and this was a great introduction for me.The first half of the CD had me laughing like crazy, I couldn't believe how funny he could make something as simple as a BBQ, or kids chasing after the ice cream man!However toward the end of the CD it became hard to hear. I thought maybe I had to turn up my CD player, but I fiddled with it for a few minutes, but to no avail. It sounded like many of the tracks on the end of the album were recorded on someone's cell phone that was sitting at the back of a comedy club while Eddie was performing. I could barely hear what he was saying.It was kinda a let down that I could only hear part of the album, but what you can hear is pure comedy gold!"
1,Two in Less thanTwo Years,I've just returned my second B&D string trimmer for the same mechanical problem -- the spool flies off while in use. The grooves holding the spool onto the drive shaft eventually strip. I used this product approximately twice a month during the grass-cutting season (March through October)...not heavy use in my opinion. I can only recommend that you not waste your time on this product.
4,"Loved this Film, and meddling old men","I'm a sucker for a good love story and this truly was. Too many gay films today fit into either one of two categories...1) meaningless, pointless sex with no plot or 2) some kind of depressing either thriller, drug addict, male prostitute (rent boy) or horror. It is so refreshing to watch a nice love story. Unfortunately, there are some weak points; Its a little weak on plot and acting. But really who cares, the story is cute, characters-likable and it has a happy ending."
4,sweet,"This isn't a polished, slick Hollywood production, tho the camera work is excellent. The actors are a little jerky sometimes. Overall, it's a nice little story with some funny moments, and I find myself watching it about once every six months. Feel good, happy ending."
1,NOT ORIGINAL RECORDINGS,Buyer Beware. These Are Re-Makes. If you're looking for original recordings please do your homework before buying. Save your money.
1,description mismatch,"The published track list looked like the perfect ""best of Adriano Celentano"", so imagine my disappointment at receiving the CD with a totally different selection of songs (with titles ringing no bells for this long-time Celentano fan). Bottom line - I returned the CD back to Amazon. I see no value in this CD, unless one is into collecting obscure works of this artist."
3,Small,Needs more doll pictures and information. But that would be thicker and cost more. Good for traveling to take with you to swap met.
5,Wonderful but hard to understand,This was a very good book. I love history and Henry theVIII so this was perfect. It was a little hard to understand. But other than that I loved it!!!
3,Ok,"It was an ok book, but not my favorite. The book called The Mysterious Benidict Society is my favorite book."
5,I love it,"This book is very interesting. I started becoming interested in the history of queens and kings of England eversince I read this book. Queen Anne Boleyn is one of my favourite queens in the whole world. She's determined to show the world that one day, she will be queen above all the people who had hated, rejected and scorned her. It made me feel like I was Anne myself. This book should not only be read by older people. 11 year old kids like me can also read and enjoy it. By, NM kid."
3,Needs a patch to work with XP,"We picked up this old software in a dollar store. Our six-year-old enjoys it and can navigate it without help.Regarding the compatibility issues, if you do a web search for ""running I Love Science in XP"" or something similar, you'll find that the company's web site has provided a patch to allow the program to run in XP. It's misleading that the CD is labeled ""XP-compatible"", which it is not unless you download the patch.If you run Vista or Windows 7, this software will definitely not work."
2,should make it easy to open,this product I'm still trying to figure out how to open it.it shouldn't be hard for the owner to open the lock.they should have made the lock better.
4,"Great for going ""off the beaten path"".","I purchased this book to help me find some 'off the beaten path' locations in and around Washington County. Its not written as a guide book for the casual tourist. Rather, its really meant for people who are already familiar with the general locale. Familiarity with the general streets and locations will aid considerably for successfully locating your 'out of the way' place of choice. Once you get the hang of the book and it's instructions it you'll find yourself in places you didn't know existed. I was particularly excited about the volume of cemeteries mentioned in the book. These hold incredibly rich clues to the life and times of the areas and can be a valuable source of local history. This is well worth the $14.95 I paid for it."
4,he who looks around will see much,"I am still trying to figure out why this woman did not question more about her husbands depression. I really enjoyed the book, but like anyone am confused about the people. These two led a more ""by the numbers"" life than I do. Just because they lived in the country does not mean they did not have the same pressures we all have. they just had them in a different way. Don't look to these two to start or continue a good marriage. this is not how to communicate.I still wonder about the events with his sons (read the book and you will see). How could a father not go looking...??????very interesting book, and highly recommended.frustrating, but interesting review of how we are as people."
4,three wise guys !,"I think this is a great movie to watch for the holidays it got some funny parts and some stupid silly stuff but is a great movie I will not say is a comedy movie cause the movie is not as funny as you think but the plot is great I did enjoy watching this movie I think is worth it watching it , when I first start watching it I thought I was going to be disapointed but I wasn't I watch the entire movie even though I was tired that day I do recomended it if you want to see a silly crazy movie with a nice Christmas Spirit."
2,Misfire,I bought this computer without doing my homework and have come to regret it. It is very attractive and does it's job reasonably well for the price. I dislike having to remove the os (who wants xp?) but that is par for the course. However support from compaq is almost non-existent:No battery availableNo docking station availableNo memory upgrade availableIf I am at home I want to use my desktop peripherals. If I am away I *need* long battery life. If I can have neither why do I own the computer?
2,"Runs very hot, poor battery life","This laptop runs very hot, I'm afraid the casewill melt. Speed is ok, comparable to an 800MHzPentium machine. Battery life is below 2 hours."
1,Bibilical incorrect,"This book is not Biblically correct. It does not adhere to sound doctrine. Donald Basham's ""interpretation"" of speaking in tongues is completely off. I don't have anything against those who are Charismatic - but this book is not spiritually sound nor is it spiritually safe in regards to what are spiritual matters. If you are of a sound mind and truely love Jesus Christ - do not buy this book with the intentions of growing closer to Him. It is a good book to read if you want to learn about how twisted and mangled someone can make Paul sound. The particular danger in this book is how the topic is conveyed. There are some elements that adhere to doctrine and is considered edifying to church. However, after conveying what is correct, there is additional information that does not agree with what the Bible says. I would advise you to carefully checkout what is sound, theological doctrine before reading this book.In Him."
1,Very disappointed.,"I am generally a fan of NOH products, in fact I ordered a 12 pack of the Fried Rice seasoning to get free shipping when I ordered a 12 pack of Char Siu which is why I was ordering in the first place.The package says you can season up to four cups of rice, I did about that, and it was basically bland, and tasteless. I used pork Char Siu in with it, and that was fine, as I said, I am a big fan of NOHs Char Siu, but this stuff was about useless.I added extra Teriyaki sauce, just to give the rice some flavor, and it actually got better tasting the 2nd day. I am going to try this again with about 2 cups of rice, just to see if its better in a smaller batch. I mean I got 11 more pouches of this stuff, I gotta find some use for it."
2,Problem with 7 dBi Magnetic Mobile WiFi Antenna (for MC and Wardriving),This antenna can only be used if the magnetic base is attached to a large metal plane like a roof or body of a car. This requirement wasn't very clear in the ad.
2,"Get ""Iowa"" Instead.","For the Resident Evil remix of ""My Plague"", they basically cut out all the curses, changed the screaming into singing, and shortened down the song by about a minute. Sound bad? It is. The music is just the same as the original, and the things listed above are the only changes. I give it 2 stars for the live tracks (which I do not have, I don't even have this album. I have the remix burned), which must be good, because Slipknot's always good live, or so I heard. But, if you want ""My Plague"", get ""Iowa"" and get the original, but if you insist in getting the ""remix"" (or just ""MTV approiate version"", as I like to call it), get this. But ""Iowa""'s better..."
4,"Looky here , what a package,what a deal.","Bloody Buccaneers is a very good cd,and Face It is a great cd,for the price of one.Nice.Temporary Madness is the most hypnotic song since the Moontan days.Rest of Buccs is a solid effort.Face It is pure rock'n roll Earring style,without a weak track,with Legalize Telepathy being the stellar track of this one.If you kind of like GE but have not got any in a while due to not knowing what to get,this is a very solid package.They are definitely on a roll here."
5,New Publication of an important play,"This verse play was published first in 1956 with various performances. A tour de force in language, the work presents the compelling connections and failures of love in a complex family whose troubled equilibrium is fatally disturbed by a guest. This guest is a friend of the son whom he has enthralled and whose introduction into the family affects each member and all their relationships. Although all talk in poetry, with many striking metaphors, each character is distinct and defined. The plot moves swiftly to vivid tragedy yet complete dramatic resolution."
1,Good for the first week,I purchased this for my pocket pc a week ago and it worked great... Signal strength etc.Then when I turned it on yesterday it totally crashed. Literally this thing is dreaded for PDAs. you have to soft reset it every time. A MUST AVOID. I would give this negative 5 stars.Now I have to buy a new pocket pc cause Im out of warranty. rrrrrrrrrrrr
1,Spectec Wireless Card Disaster,"I recently purchased the SDIO Wireless card. This card is worse than useless, it crashed my PDA. I was never able to get the card working. The online sales blurb and the documentation clearly indicated that my PDA was on the list of supported equipment. The documentation sucks (it is non-existent).I will not purchase any more Sectec products.I do not recommend this product."
1,A Tale of Two Cities,"I know this is a classic, and I always wanted to read it, but I couldn't get past the first chapter."
5,Are there any smokies with ears on?,"Excellent. Groove beats and smooth female vocals. This is by far their best album, I've listened to it for years now. I didn't dig their follow ups to this one nearly as well, unfortunately. This album has been said to be too similar to Portishead, but I think that it's much more upbeat, less dark but still just as good."
4,close your eyes for the host,"While the host leaves a lot to look at, his synopsis is consice, presice, and delivered articulately. The images and video are delivered well and in an excellent chronology to help understand the issues of the periods. The video delves into the cultural, political, economic and technological aspects of the time period."
2,The Remarkable 20th Century: The Astonishing Events and People that Have Shaped Our Modern World,"We ordered 13 copies of this item to give away as gifts. The one we listened to had quality problems on a couple of the DVD's, so now we don't know whether to give them as gifts or not. It is not nearly as good as the Peter Jennings one, but then that one is a lot more expensive too."
2,"Weak remixes, but OK for TE fans","The Trouser Enthuiasts have done some of their best work for Dannii (""Disrememberance,"" ""All I Wanna Do""), so this single came as a disappointment. The club-length Burnt Angel mix is repetitive and made unlistenable, in my opinion, by the addition of guy rapping. The radio mix at least is short and more varied. Not one of the better Dannii/TE efforts certainly."
4,2-way radio,Wery helpful if you often going to hiking or camping. But even if you just visiting with your family a museum you can see how beneficial is the vibro mode
5,5 stars,"One of the best songwriters of the century... And please, no more Staten Island Junkies trying to trash a New York Icon...Typical NY 10 year old mentality...."
5,A MUST BUY for music fans,I just got this greatest hits package the other day and I was not at all disappointed.This is my very first Billy Joel album and he really impressed me.Well worth the price.Get it!
2,Puzzling and Unnecessary,"What a pointless box set. Now I personally think all you need from Joel is Greatest Hits I & II, a cheap and concise package that sums up his glory days quite nicely. But even if you must have the third volume, which does have big hits like ""We Didn't Start The Fire"" & ""River of Dreams"", it is cheaper to get it seperate or even in the 'Greatest Hits I, II & III' package. This box set just adds a lot of pretty packaging, plus a fourth disc - made up of interview sound bites and some live rarities. Since this fourth CD is mostly dialogue, it is not likely to be played much either. Won't the dedicated fans already have these songs? It's a shame that they would have to shell out so much cash for three discs of stuff they already own just to get the fairly interesting bonus CD. And what casual fan would opt for such a pricey & extravaggant package, the meat of which is available elsewhere for less money? I fail to see it's relevence."
3,Don't buy just for the gun n roses track,"If u like the other artists on this album, by al means buy this album. But if u just want the new gnr track... DONT BUY IT!!!O My God is the worst gnr song i have ever heard, except maybe for My World. If your looking for classic gnr, you will be greatly dissapointed with O My God. O My God is an annoying 3 or so minutes of annoying industrial noise. It is incrediably annoying and it sounds nothing like Axl Rose. It is a pathetic excuse for gnr. Whoever said it sounded like appetite is wrong. This song is so bad it could never be up to par with any song on appetite. It is HORRIBLE!!! It sounds nothing like the original guns n roses. I purchased this album just for the new gnr, but it was a waste of money because i didn't really like any of the other bands that much.If you like any of the other bands on this soundtrack buy it, but if u just want gnr, im sorry you will probably be greatly dissapointed."
4,"Some good tracks, lot of big names, GNR steals the show...","""Oh My God"" is just a killer song. The first time I heard it I was like ""what the hell is this?"" but it really does grow on you. It may not be the best song GNR have ever written, but it's far from the worst either, and with them that's saying quite a bit! This is a new role for Axl, as the old ""classic"" band on a hard-hitting soundtrack like this, but he fills it well, with what is perhaps the freshest and hardest hitting of all the tracks. And even though it's new, there's plenty of that classic GNR feel to the piece as well. The songs by Korn and Eminem are both pretty good too, but if you have some of their other work you can't help thinking ""haven't I heard this already?"" a couple times during each of these performances, but there're also some new ideas so it's OK. The rest of the album hasn't differentiated itself in my mind yet, except for the Limp Bizkit song which bores me. Kid Rock should have been on this soundtrack, too."
1,Get Real Axel,"I heard the new GNR song the other day. I was expecting a little taste of old GNR, however much to my surprise ""Oh My God"" takes a whole different road. GNR was one of a kind back in the day, but the new sound is nothing unique for today's industry. I have not heard much of new GNR's music lately(with the exception of ""Oh My God""), but it seems unlikely that without the help of Slash, anything memorable is quite remote. My advice to Axel is not to put the reputation of old GNR on the line by settling for anything below old GNR par.-anonymous"
2,GnR Disappointment,"This CD was purchased primarily on the strength of the previous GnR reviews. Unfortunately, the track isn't close to my expectations. I tried playing it several times, hoping to gain some type of appreciation for it, but to no avail. I now skip over that track, along with others. Fortunately, there are some good solid tracks featured. Examples follow, in order of quality entertainment; PMM,Everlast,PM5K,Korn,Creed,Zombie,Bizkit and Prodogy(many of which have a good high energy beat). The dismal performers, and ones to skip are Eminem and GnR. The final two are so-so. I received the Matrix CD with the same order, and found that it is much more intense and energetic. The Matrix, by contrast, can be played enjoyably from beginning to end."
4,Great dance music from a great artist.,"Personally, I think mainstream black radio mistakenly ignored this. True, Michael has had his share of problems, but that's no reason to ignore output from one of the major artists of our time. Listen to ""Morphine"" as it segues into ""Superfly Sister""--absolutely brilliant. Pras and Wycliff of the Fugees take on ""2 Bad""--a song that I didn't think could possibly improve--on the remixes. Excellent! And what about those Teddy Riley post-new jack grooves? Bumpin'! (Props go out to the other remix artists.) A great CD."
1,Blood on the Dance Floor,This review deals with Michael Jackson and a total let down of his talents. The CD is not one of his best performances in singing and surely not professional.
5,love this!,We have a beardwd collie puppy. I use this on her whenever I brush her. It smells good & it makes her coat very shiny!Good price for a great product!
5,Inspirational,"This Bible is very easy to read, and it has inspired me to learn more about our faith and our relationship with God. The explanations provided are simple enough to understand, and provide a starting point for further reading if one is so inclined. I strongly recommend this Bible to all Catholics."
5,Great Women's Devotional Bible,The Bible is easy to read & understand. Chapters are divided and the readings are like short stories. Recommended for someone who want a Bible that is easy to read.
5,Excellent Book,My wife has found this book to be enlightening and inspiring. The perspectives and insights by Ann Spangler were especially appreciated.
5,All thumbs up.,"It's time that we all start counting our lucky chickens. Reading ""don't look back we're not going that way!"" - Marcia Wallace's autobiography is one of those lucky chickens for me. I agree with author W. Bruce Cameron (from the back cover), ""...Marcia Wallace has the wit, humor and heart to keep you laughing while laying bare all the details of her amazingly rich life...""The Christmas Letters dispersed throughout her book weave a magical and emotional thread that is the core of Marcia's life story. Her heartfelt insights and perceptions deeply touched my emotions and I not only laughed, but also cried at the same time. Believe me it's not easy to do. Her courage and perseverance are an inspiration. I consider myself a past, present and future admirer of this wonderfully talented and witty performer. All thumbs up."
4,"Unusual, Dark Comedy","Picked this DVD up at the library, believe it or not. Sounded interesting. Had NOT read the book, so we were able to take it at face value.My husband and I found ourselves laughing and getting into the lives of these quirky characters, even though they had very little for us to identify with. Jennifer Jason Leigh was very good, as were Mischa Barton and Bug Hall.The best part of this movie was the scenic views of Wyoming countryside. Okay, I read that it was actually filmed in Canada. But they did do a good job of presenting the natural side of their area.Overall, this was a good movie, although not in my Top 20 favorites. Worth watching, especially if you can check it out for free from the library.By the way, I know nothing about this, but apparently there is another movie (a prequel, at that) with the same characters from the trilogy by Tim Sandlin: it is called Floating Away. Not sure if I would see that one or not..."
5,"""Powerful Stuff""","This album, one of the first for the Winans brothers, has always been a truly powerful piece of work. The music artistry for a Contemporary Christian CD is unparralled. The vibrant, soulful, joyful voices, mixed with the instrumentals brings a distinct sound and message to those who know (and do not know Christ). ""Millions"" was such a song, so intense that it made me feel like I was there, singing the words, envisioning what it will be like when I join Christ and reign with him. Gave me goosebumps..."
4,Very happy with unit,"I agree with the last review that you need to prop up the front of the unit, but this is hardly an inconvenience. I have a 18 inch high coffee table and place a one inch prop under the front. Works perfectly. The unit even has ""keystone"" adjustment which will adjust for any distortion.I like the unit because it eliminates the need for a big screen TV. It has a built-in DVD, built in sound (which is terrific) and comes with an 80 inch screen that retail for $200 when sold separately. It works fine in lighted rooms and even hooks up easily to my existing home entertainment system."
1,Carnival Size dissapointment,"I bought this cd because I previously had heard some of Wyclef's songs, I thought his lyrics and voice was tight. I thought I would by it, the songs I liked in the past were drowned out by about 5 intros and about 20 songs that don't feature Wyclef (the whole reason I bought the cd). So don't buy the cd if you like his lyrics or voice, because you won't get either of them."
5,Wyclef demonstrates his musical Midas touch.,"What can I say? I used to sneer at hip-hop. This amazing CD has converted me into a God-fearing believer. I have never encountered such an amazing fusion of so many musical styles, and with such mesmerizing results! Wyclef draws upon his diverse musical background, including many sounds from the Carribean. Many of these may be unfamiliar to the listener, but Wyclef never fails to please. Check out the guitar on ""Bubblegoose"" for an amazing synthesis of music! Check this one out, even if you are inclined to skip it."
5,"A great mixture of rap, rock, disco, and reggae.","Autobiographical statements are apparent in such songs as ""To All The Girls"" and ""Gone Till November."" ""We Just Tryin' To Stay Alive"" is a great dance song, great to get you in the mood for a night out on the town. The reggae songs towards the end sound eerily like Bob Marley as they take you to the Carribean."
1,Disappointed,I really thought this product would be the magic I've been looking for but it wasn't. I used it exactly as instructed and it burned my skin and left my nose bright red for hours ( and I am a medium skinned Hispanic). It also left my nose super shiny and the blackheads were still there. I have never been senstive to any skin prodcut before.I do not recommend this product. I am back to using pore strips and baby diaper rash cream (it works!) to get rid of blackheads.
4,"gutwrenching, intentionally tedious and the Danish accent is tough on the ears","I thought all Scandinavian languages would sound like the Swedish Chef on The Muppet Show but not Danish in the Pusher movies. Christ, it could have been a character in the movie. The movies and the aural experience was like choking on something. I watched all three movies and I recommend them but they are all very different from one another. The stories are depressing because it's about lousy criminals in Copenhagen but it's gross in a Trainspotting way to keep American audiences watching otherwise most of us would NEVER sit through a Scandinavian movie. Most people don't watch Ingmar Bergman movies for fun or really at all."
1,would love to actually watch this film,"The copy I've got refuses to load in three different dvd players. It plays a bit then goes crazy. The disc seems fine but the film itself goes all digital and spotty, as if it is poorly made?Anyway thought I'd let folks know."
2,not good,"I got my package in a timely manner which was good, however the issues I'm having with this Pusher trilogyis that only two out of the three DVD's work, parts 2,3 work just fine however the first Pusher dvd doesnt work at all.I tried it on my X-BOX, then my dvd player, and even my labtop just to be sure its wasnt a problem with my equitmentand it turned out that part 1 of the trilogy doesnt work, I'm hoping the seller will correct my issue soon"
1,Failure,Would love to comment on the movie but I was barely able to understand a word of it so didn't get past the first 20mins. Very disappointed as by the reviews I would have enjoyed it otherwise - my sort of movie. Quality of audio was disgusting.I trashed it.
4,good purchase,"This was a gift for my daughter, so I haven't used it yet. She uses it all the time and loves it. She easily transfers photos from the camera to the computer.My only complaint is that it does not come with rechargable batteries. We have gone through 4 sets of regular batteries and its only been 3 1/2 weeks."
1,would not get this camera,The camrea takes forever to turn on and has a BIG lag time between when you hit the button and it actually takes the picture. This means you often miss the photo you wanted to get. The lcd screen turns itself off inbetween photos and won't turn itself back on when you halfway press the shutter botton down. This thing eats through batteries. I'm spending some more money and am getting a canon.
3,Good for Amatuer Photographers,"The camera is nice, screen is clear, creates nice pictures. A great camera for a teen or anyone who needs to get used to taking digital pictures. The only problem with this camera is that it eats batteries. I would suggest purchasing rechargeable batteries. Also my daughter's camera only lasted a little over a year, and then it broke. When I took it to a camera shop to see if it could be repaired, they told me the computer chip was damaged due to age, and would cost more to replace it than to buy a new one."
2,you can do better,"I bought this camera for an industrial setting. We use it everyday for indoor conditions. It takes very poor pics under florescent lighting. If you go to ISO 400 it helps but still not great. The worst thing about it is the software. It's clumsy and un-intuitive. Worse yet, is if you don't want to use they're stupid software you're outa luck as it doesn't show as a drive that you can access. All and all go for a Canon (like I have at home). The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it hasn't broken."
1,Don't buy Kodak!,"Bought our son this camera for his 10th birthday. First day worked fine. Second Day, it would not turn on...red blinking light only when the on button was activated. Replaced batteries (per troubleshooting guide). Returned it; figured we got a lemon. Bought a new one...same model. Same problem! But on the first day. Called Kodak. Got someone in India barely speaking english, which only added to my frustration. They wanted us to return it for repair. No thanks...we're returning it and getting a CANON."
3,Well...,"Ummm, well this book has it's moments of clarity and interest and moments when it's like the writer just seems to be rambling. It's not really about what most people would consider the middle ages to be about (knights, castles, dragons), but maybe that is a good thing. So if you read it, don't expect it to be a fun little text, but it's not terrible either."
3,Greatest hits but not greatest recordings,"The hits are all there but some of the versions selected really detract. ""Footloose"" and ""I'm Alright"" lack the punch experienced on the movie soundtracks, FM or other CD's. At times, ""I'm Alright"" sounded like an outtake. Similarly, ""Forever"" and ""Celebrate Me Home"" just didn't do it for me. I'm not a purist but would have preferred a studio sounding ""Pooh Corner"" to the version that sounded like he actually was singing to his infant son. I've always been a fan but overall, I'm disappointed."
5,Loggins bloggins,I was surprised by the tunes on this CD. I am very glad to add it to my collection. Loggins is a very talented musician.
3,"Good written tips, bad practice CD","This book was my only source to practice before taking Toefel IBT. I will say the real test is 95% similar with what was presented in the book. I got good scores but reading was terrible because I did not have enough timing practice. If you want to have an idea of how the test is going to be, you should read the whole book. But if you want to practice, use another source and time yourself as much as possible. Good luck!"
4,Great For All EMS personnel,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, used it in conjunction with my paramedic classes, keep it with me while on duty, and find it a great refresher. The format is simple and straight forward and written as you might encounter an incident. I had the good fortune to meet Dr. Traynor and several of the reviewers noted in the book. Dr. Traynor also taught the patient assesment segment of my EMTP class and some other reviewers also taught in our medic class. I recommend this book to everyone in EMS and am waiting for the second edition!! Thank you Dr. Traynor, et al"
1,Don't buy this book,"This is a book which I can't recommend to anyone. It contains a very limited number of examples of how to use 750 verbs, but a good italian dictionary does this much better for thousands of verbs. I also recommend that you buy a book in italian or the excellent book ""Les verbes italiens"" written in french to learn how to conjugate the italian verbs instead of 501 italian verbs. They are much smaller, contain more verbs and cleary indicate the irregular parts."
5,New Christians' Handbook Everything New Belivers Need To Know,Very Good Book. Very Much on Point. Shares different views on several points. We were looking for a book to give to new believers and we found it.
5,Great cardio and strength training aid.,"I use this weight belt when exercising on my recumbent cycle, and while doing abdominals. I like that I can adjust the weights to suite the intensity of the workout. And, I can feel the themogenic burning in my core area afterwards."
2,Not very helpful if you use cloth diapers,"This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space.I would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers."
2,Looks are deceptive,"Looks kinda ugly.Plus the manufacturer has gone out of his way to ensure that munchkin wipes warmer doesn't fit on top of this. They could easily made it universal and used less plastic in the process!Are they thinking that due to this, I'll go and buy a lionheart warmer?Not becoming a Lionheart fan anytime sooner."
4,Good Purchase,"The depot fits nicely next to the changing pad and does hold the essentials. I just wish the two side containers were a little bigger; they do not fit the big bottles of lotion with much room for anything else. Overall, I would recommend this product, especially for the price."
5,6011 1/8,Forney has done very well in putting these rods in a case that travels well. Next time I buy rods it will be from Forney
4,Oxygene lives!,Not disappointed. This album picks up right where the original Oxygene finished off. Have only just discovered this album after first hearing Oxygene 1-6 over 20 years ago.
2,Not at all satisfying,"I'm sorry, but as a Jarre-fan I can only say I find this sequal to Oxygene 1-6 not worth the money asked for it. You can actually hear him almost copying the old Oxygenes. The singles taken from it, contain besides the single-versions also way better (club)house versions from other artists, but even that cannot give me the feeling, that paying about 12 dollars is worth this one. Chronologie and the 80's where way better, that is, in my opinion! The use of old Moogs and Mellotrons, and the replay of old Oxygene just doesn't work (for me); for the rest I can only say: continue making synthmusic."
2,Oxygene-starved,"Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release.The point? Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me. Like a good souffle, it was better the first time.Indeed, inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch. And guess what turned out to be Jarre's next project?Whoops! Writer's block, perchance?Olly Buxton"
5,LOle the Taste,I take 2 packets and make a paste. put the chicken in the oven or on the Grill and when its almost done I brush it on and cook till Crispy. What a flavor.....Love All there Products.
5,Insightful,Definately glad to have gotten this book. Asks some good questions and helps ya to focus on some of what should be common sense things that tend to break up so many marriages these days. Getting married next year and am glad to have things like this to give a curriculum to go through to help me get to know my fiance on a much more intimate level.
1,"Preaches Christianity, More of the book in workbook format.","My fiance and I bought the book, and the two work books and were very much disappointed. It's focused on Christianity specifically, treats men and women as if they were two great masses of clones, etc. Multiple choice has a lot of room for interpretation - dangerous for a defensive person to be doing. I recommend the power of two workbook instead."
4,for my son,I hope it helps my son! He is newly married and already having some problems. I will give him this book today.
4,tasty,"This is a tasty seasoning mix. The instructions call for deep frying the chicken, but it tastes just as good if you pan fry with minimal oil. It is not that spicy, so add some pepper sauce if you like it really hot. You can probably create this seasoning pretty easily by yourself for less money, but the pre-mixed packet is nice for lazy people who don't have lots of different ingredients lying around in their kitchen."
3,"good, but...","Okay, first i would like to address the over whelming amount ofreviews that say this album is upbeat and happy. Yes, some of themusic is upbeat, as it was on the last album but the lyrics are not. Example, ""hanging around"", what most would say is ""upbeat"", ""happy"", contains the lyrics ""well i got all this time, to be waiting for what is mine, to be hating what i am, after the light has faded"". Yup, that's peppy. Musically, the album is neither here nor there, although i feel that alot of there musical choices distract from Adam's vocals. The counting crows became what they are today from presenting something that a lot of other bands didn't, a kind of stripped down honesty. Don't get me wrong change is good, sometimes. I like this album because i have been a fan of this band, and the album has its moments and redeeming qualities. I just hope the next album takes a turn backwards towards the first album."
3,Not AAEA.... but good.,"Fans will typically rate their bands with a bit of a bias. I AM a fan of Duritz and Co. but I believe that this CD is not on par with their past CDs.Oh there are good songs on this CD which catch your ear and even stick in your head all day. In particular, Hanging Around. Still, the lyrics aren't *THE LYRICS* of AAEA, if you know what I mean. These are more esoteric and forced.The music itself seems slightly more heavy than that of CC's past, I wonder if this is an attempt to ""modernize."" In any case, I give this CD 3 stars, its good.... but it is not something you should rush out and buy."
4,I've converted,"As a 60s guy, it's taken me a while to get used to contemporary stuff. But I really like this album and not because Crows are compared to Van Morrison and The Band. They don't really sound similar other than the fact that Van and Adam (along with the late Richard Manuel of the Band) have three of the most emotional voices in rock.What actually got me was a particular line in ""Mrs. Potter'' that demonstrated that Duritz finally found a subtle sense of humor _ like Dylan, he can be sophomorically self-indulgent at time. The line: ""If dreams are like movies, that memories are films about ghosts. You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast.''Hope he means from LA to San Diego and not from Berkeley to LA."
1,The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish,"I am sorry to see that Counting Crows have swiped the cover to Dave McKean's children's book masterpiece ""The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish."" The book is awesome, but couldn't Counting Crows have come up with something else? How unimaginative. How disappointing. Go get the book, forget about the Counting Crows, they are so over!"
4,Bonus Track,Don't stop listening to this CD after St. Robinson in his Cadillac Dream. There's an unlisted bonus track after about 1:30 of dead air. IT'S GREAT!
4,Best effort by the Crows,"I've always liked the Counting Crows, and I have most of the CDs, and when this album came out I was suprised how muched I liked it. On the surface it's very similar to other Crows albums, but this one has a different energy behind it that make it better to listen to it the more you here it. The 1st track is the type of song you listen to when you get up in the morning and it puts you in a great mood."
4,For Fans Only,"From the first blissfully angst-ridden refrain to the last, this album will soothe the ears of the long-suffering Crows fan. Does it challenge? Provoke beyond the sphere of the band's debut album? No, but this listener isn't complaining. After a tumultuous love affair with ""August"" I was slightly dissappointed in the long-winded ""Satellites."" Where had the full-throated, goosebump-giving, jangly, funky, and gloriously morose sound gone? In their third album, the group gives its fans what they've been waiting so patiently for: more of the same. You'll love Mrs. Potter's Lullaby, wallow in Colorblind, and revel in Mr. Potter and his Cadillac dream. Lacking a little on the emotional front? Feel vicariously through Duristz and the gang."
5,This Desert Life proves that Counting Crows grow and improve,"Ignore the negative reviews! They have come from people who want the same thing they have become comfortable with. This Desert Life is a spectacular evolution for a progressive band. With poignant tracks, such as Mrs. Potter's Lullaby, they create a mood. While listening to this latest creation by the Crows, I was unable to sit down. This Desert Life is another step in the evolution of a great band. They have created three great albums, all different from the other. And each valid on its own merit. This Desert Life exceeds expectations of a true fan."
5,"Before this, I didn't even know who the Crows were","When I first heard ""Hangin' Around"" on the radio, I had to find out who sang it. I remember vaguely hearing of the Counting Crows before, but I couldn't tell you anything they sang. So, on a leap of faith, I bought ""This Desert Life"". After listening to it, I knew I remembered ""Colorblind"" from ""Cruel Intentions"". But more importantly, I just really liked the whole CD. I checked out the band's page, and then realized what all they had put out. I immediately bought the other CDs, and now consider myself a Crows fan. In fact, just yesterday I bought tickets to my first Counting Crows concert. Duritz brings out the full range of emotions on this one. I think a definite for any collection."
2,Doesn't Charge the Shuffle as stated,"Am I the only one having this problem? Purchased it instead of looking for a charger to replace my broken one. Every thing written about this unit says it will charge the shuffle, but it doesn't. I even pulled out the usb adapter and plugged it right into my pc and it still wouldn't charge it.Read thru the manual and it didn't mention anything about charging the shuffle, it just says that in the description of the item everywhere it is sold. So people, if it does charge it, what am i doing wrong?"
1,Save your money!,"I have lived and travelled throughout Africa over the past 10 years. Although Murphy is a highly praised author for her other books I found this one to be poor. There were such touches of arrogance that sent me through the roof.To paraphase a section, ""I can't understand why people travel by organized overland Lorries . I travelled solo and maximized the experience"" and yet she always had to seek out only those Africans that spoke English...This might seem trite, but it summarizes the attitude and sometimes misinformation that flowed through-out the book"
2,TYPICAL LIFETIME CHANNEL MOVIE STORY,"IT'S DEFINITELY A TV MOVIE, BARELY WATCHABLE, SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE. I PURCHASED THIS BECAUSE OF LINDSAY WAGNER, SHE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TV STARS. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND BUYING THIS, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD CATCH THIS ON TELEVISION."
4,Warriors Navajo Code Talkers,Great book with lots of pictures. I would recommend the purchase of this book to someone else if you're looking for a conversational piece.
1,Not quite there!,"I purchased this for a friend's daughter and assumed that it came with two invisible marker's and two developer marker's that make the invisible ink show up. You get two of everything else, but only one set of markers (one is an invisible ink marker, the other the developer). I paid $6.99 for mine at Hobby Lobby. It is worth about $2.00. I would recommend ordering the set of four Invisible Ink Ballpoint Pen & Black Light 4 pack from DDDiscs on amazon.com. Yes, they cost about $3.00 per pen ($11.97 total). While the pens are not actually ballpoints, they are a marker style and work great! The blue/purple light on the end is used to make the ink visible. Then for $7.99 on amazon.com order the book ""Top Secret: A Handbook of Codes, Ciphers, and Secret Writing."""
5,Love that Kathryn Harvey,Readers have been waiting 20 years to hear from Kathryn Harvey again. Butterfly and Stars protagonists come alive again in Private Entrance. Bravo!
2,Private Entrance,There was not a plot. The characters were hard to follow. Did not even compare to her other 2 books
2,Not in the same class as the first two,"I loved the first two books of this trilogy and was looking forward to the third. However, it was a huge let down. It did not include any of the same characters from the first 2 books, so I am not sure why it is considered a part of the trilogy other than the fact that it had a business similar to what was in the first two. It did not have much of a plot line and the characters were very flat, unlike the ones I came to love in the first two books. The only reason that I read the whole book was to see if it got any better or if any of the past characters showed up - neither happened. The first two books of this trilogy are wonderful, but don't waste your time on this one."
4,Great stroller for young babies,"This stroller is fun and easy to push. The fabric is stylish and it goes great with the companion car seat. My concern is that my 12-month old reaches the foot rest, and he fills the tiny seat. This is a great stroller for a young baby, but don't plan to use it for a 2-year-old.It is rather heavy, and folding takes two hands. It's rather difficult to get it folded without scraping it on the ground. The sunshade is small but you can buy an add on. So, just be aware that while the stroller itself works great, if you need to fold and unfold it a lot, or if you have a toddler, this is not the best choice.Overall, though, I look forward to a walk with the baby each day with this stroller."
2,MiniPort USB hub,"Not the greatest little device at all, I bought this because it was inexpensive, but come to find out you get what you pay for. When trying to use this little hub it would lose connectivity with multiple devices plugged in, I did end up buying a replacement hub by a more popular name and it works great without any issues."
5,"relaxing, calming...","I highly recommend this CD along with ""effortless relaxation"" by the same artist...both are relaxing, soothing, just what the doctor ordered...BUY IT NOW!! This CD is fantastic!!!!"
3,FYI-Books by this author are described in Jan. 1998 Esquire.,"Books by Charles Portis are described in January's Esquire. (I have not read this book or any of his books, but am interested as a result of the article, which is highly complementary)."
3,Not a Keeper,"Thankfully I didn't buy this book but borrowed it from the library instead. Granted, Portis is a skilled writer but ""masterpiece"" this is not. He has a way with words but in the end they don't come together to form a satisfying or even interesting story. I loved True Grit, also a dialogue driven book, and it did move along with purpose. ""Dog"" on the other hand bogged down with countless excursions through a mental ward of odd characters and their quirky histories several of which added nothing to the substance. Perhaps this was the whole point and if so, shame on me I missed it. Honestly, it became so tedious that I took to skip-reading the second half and concluded that I didn't miss much by doing so.There are many funny moments that arise mostly from Ray's OCD tendencies and I laughed out loud--but a collection of witticisms and ""mucous on the prescription"" type details doesn't make a great novel. Not for me anyway."
2,abe simpson is much funnier,"many reviews state how hilarious this book is -- even several on the jacket cover.try as i may, i didn't find myself laughing.lots of long pointless rambling monologues that are much funnier when provided by abe simpson.i give it two stars because he does manage to capture dialogue very well (rambling and aimless as it may be).the story is pointless - but the joke may be on us.maybe portis' goal was to write a rambling tale about nothing just to see how many of us would actually finish the story awaiting something to actually happen. and then laugh when he read the glowing reviews.jerry seinfeld would be proud."
5,Wish Amazon Allowed Six-Star Reviews,"The Dog of the South is, hands down, one of the funniest books ever written. It's a foolproof test of anyone's sense of humor. I've read it over and over and every time it makes me laugh out loud."
3,No laughing matter,"On the advice of Larry Doyle, quoted in The Week magazine (June 15,2007) as saying, it's ""the funniest book ever written"", I grabbed The Dog of the South for a good summer laugh. What a disappointment; I think I laughed twice. I shouldn't take it out on the book, because it is a good read, but with a build up like that I sure expected more."
3,Interesting stories,"A series of interesting stories that were exaggerated for the printed page. The guys who really shaped the world, the guys that he worked with but couldn't name, could never publish their stories and would never take credit. The stories would never be allowed to be retold even if fictionalized. And if they were to be told few people would actually believe them because as they say; the truth is stranger than fiction. Take this for what it is, a recounting of many stories of past glories not a book of accurate events."
3,The Bounty Hunter,Jango Fett is my fav from the movie (next to Count Dooku).This is a pretty good figure .Its olny default is the legs dont move and the helmet dosent come off but its still good (especally the jetpack)
5,Horse poster,Large size bright horse poster for a granddaughter that has fallen in love with horses. Price fantastic. Arrived on time in great condition.
4,So much fun!,I'm not even a kid and I love this CD. They played this on a moose tour when my fiance and I were on vacation and we just adored it so much we had to have it!
3,"alright RPG, but I've played better","This RPG left me with a lot to be desired. The battle system is a little off, I died like six times the first time I played the game. Make sure you save often, because the game glitches every now and then, to the point of crashing in some instances. For a real RPG experience, allow me to suggest The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. It has given me a much more enjoyable experience."
1,game does not work,"The game would not run on my Windows XP based computer. Although the game loaded, it was not able to run. The seller was helpfull in giving me ideas; however, he ultimately agreed to just take it back."
2,This Game isnt all that great.,"When i got this game i was expecting something good, like a good hack and slash game or at least a game that i can get involved in. But the truth is the game leaves little free room, as the charactors you get are not all that smooth to begin with. The storyline is really smooth but the overall experience leaves a RPGer such as myself...how should i say it, dissapointed. If you are into D&D and all that then by all means play it, but myself not caring much for D&D cant stand this game...in short if your are into games like diablo and Final Fantasy dont play this game, it will be a waste of your time and a waste of money."
3,Nice Shirt,The shirt is of good quality and holds up well to washing.I would buy more products from this company.
3,Good so far!,I give it three stars since I've only read half the book. I've been puuting Orben's secrets to work already.
3,The last of Philo Vance,"This book, along with the Gracie Allen mystery, were intended to turned into a screenplay with Sonja Henie playing the lead. Van Dine died before the book could be finalized.It is definitely not as good as his earlier books but still retains the flavor of the Philo Vance mysteries."
4,Great for those of us with bad knees and back ♥,Wish they were overlapping tops with Velcro at the same price ♥ ♥♥I bought them for a friend and myself as we have a hard time keeping our floors clean.
2,Not great quality,"I ordered 3 pairs , 2 fell apart , they unravel very easily . not good at allPlease improve the quality and I may revisit"
4,Sister-in-law will mop the floors now!,"A funny gift. The quality is not the best; however, this is a novelty item. It is inexpensive and worth the laughs."
5,"Solid, dependable fun","There's obviously a lot of very positive comments for this game already. I agree with everyone who enjoys this game. It's easy to play, fun and engaging for my 4 year old (she's 4.25 yrs old to be exact!). She's always up for playing Zingo and there's so many variations possible, it has not gotten boring yet. Great game!"
4,My 3 and half year old daughter loves this!,"I was hesitant about getting any kind of game for my 3 year old as I still thought she could not follow directions too well, but this one works out pretty well, because she does not need to a wait a turn. With a little practice, she was able to slide the tiles out."
5,Great game for 3 year olds,"My daughter just turned three, and she has many board games such as Memory, Chutes and Ladders, and Candy Land. Out of all her games, she likes Zingo the best. It is the first board game that she understands the rules completely. It's a bingo game basically-- you match the tiles to your board, and you win when the tiles completely covers the your board. The box says it is for 4 year old and above. But I think it is a really fun game and great idea for birthday present for a three year olds. My daughter absolutely loves it, and we enjoy playing it with her."
4,Fun if you can get your child to play correctly,"I bought this for my grand-daughter (4 when bought, 5 now) to play when she comes to visit. I bought it based on the reviews. It is a fun game. The problem came when she didn't want to follow the rules of the game, turns out she is just like her Mom was at that age. It is a cute learning game. I recommend it."
4,Zingo has stood the test of time,"Bought this for my two year old daughter, and she still plays with it three years later. Game pieces are durable, the card dispenser has not broken after years of use. She started just playing the tiles and matching to the pictures. Definitely can grow with the child and can be played with two or many players."
4,"Great for hand strengthening, scanning, matching","I'm a pediatric occupational therapist, and this game hits on many OT goals and objectives; including hand strengthening, fine motor coordination, visual scanning, matching, and socialization involved in speaking and turn-taking. My only complaint is that sometimes two cards come out and it gets stuck."
4,Zingo,"I played Zingo with my 6 year old daughter. She enjoyed the game very much, however, her sight word vocabulary is excellent and she found the words to be too easy. I would recommend this game to children who need extra support with basic sight words. It is good for kindergarten and beginning first grade."
5,great board game for the whole family,We purchased this item for my son who is 6 and my 3 year old daughter and they both loved it! I say that if you are looking for a game taht will cover several age groups this is it!!
5,ThinkFun Zingo,"Our two daughters have loved this game, and we have gifted it to several friends. It is a good one for older kids and adults to play with younger ones -- much more tolerable than candyland! Also like that there are two difficulty levels."
5,Great Game for my kids,"I have a 5,5 & 8 year old (girls and boys) and they love this game. It's actually refreshing to see them be entertained by a board game like this as compared to their normal Ipad, Iphone, computer games, etc....This one is especially good for kids in that just beginning reading stage since it identifies words with the pictures so when they are the Zingo Master they can call out the correct picture on the tiles. What a great way to play bingo from a kids perspective. No wonder there are so many great reviews for this game."
5,Fun game for the whole family,"My four year-old got this for Christmas and really enjoys it. She loves to deal herself the tiles and gets so excited when she matches one with an image on her Zingo card. She can easily play it with friends her age as well, so if she has a play date, it can keep them busy for a good 10 minutes per game. We also play as a family. We set up our tent in the living room, make popcorn, and play Zingo. It's fun! Great game. We gave this as a gift for Christmas also and the five year-old recipient really liked it, too."
3,3.5 for the whole book...5 for...,"When I found out this was Ken ""WildCard"" Karmody's story, I was excited. I only wanted to find out what happens with him.I'm not a fan of a book within a book. I didn't like it in Unsung Hero (Book 1), though I can appreciate SB's desire to bring extra info to the book, a learning along the way, just wasn't my favorite stuff to read.Out of Control I did skim by most of Rose's book, and I skimmed most of Molly and Jone's story. I got the jist of it.I LOVE that Ken finally found his love, Adele drove me nuts, the stories about her and him. Savannah is a great match with him and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series to find out how they go on in their life together."
5,I Want a Wild Card,"This is yet another great read from one of my favorites. Futhermore, it appears Ms. Brockmann has finally reached her flow and has created a superb novel made up of one main story and several smoothly transitioned subplots that turn into an exciting, emotional read. Yum! is all I can say about Kenny ""Wild Card!"" After reading her previous novels about the Seal Team and feeling the blues for poor Kenny, I am happy to say he finally comes into his own! Now if only my husband could provide the tricks he can....ladies, read and learn!"
5,Good!,"An enjoyable overview of Porter's life and career. Far too short for my liking but an improvement on that dire ""DE-LOVELY"" movie.The contributions from Porter's friends and collaborators is a treasure as most of them have passed on.Cole, edited by Robert Kimball."
3,Northwest Africa: Seizing the Initiative in the West,Paperback version of the American official history. Some minor printing errors. No folding maps. Not one of the 'best' official histories.
2,"Great idea, but get a better brand","I own this product and I own the Aqueon equivalent. Obviously, this type of product is a must for any serious aquarium owner, but the Python version of this hose is seriously crappy compared to the Aqueon. The piece that connects to the faucet leaks and is not well built. Just tonight I was cleaning my aquariums and the faucet piece broke in half while filling and sprayed water all over myself and my kitchen. The Aqueon version has never leaked and is clearly better made. I just wish my Aqueon was 50 foot instead of 25, as I'd definitely use it exclusively."
5,stavesacre best yet,this album is one of passion and intensity that will grip your heart and move you. the cd is on the lighter side of there previouse work but it does not take away anything from this cd because this is the best yet.
4,Good likeness and decent articulation.,"Unlike some of the Series 8 Palisades Muppet figures, this one can bend its knees. However, the elbows do not bend and are just made of flexible plastic. Puzzling how the knees bend but not the elbows, opposite from most others...One pet peeve: Animal was indeed red-violet early in The Muppet Show, but by the time of The Muppet Movie he was definitely red. So why are all the Animal toys red-violet?"
3,not a great toy,This toy is more of a display toy more than one you should play with. The droid wont stay together and wont stay up. Mace is cool with the force blast and push but his lightsaber doesnt stay in his hand very well. Dont buy this toy unless you intend to JUST put it on display.
5,An insightful contribution by a leading discourse analyst,"This is one of my all-time favorite discourse analytic books. Jonathan Potter, a professor in the U.K., illustrates how rhetoric and discourse analysis can come together in provocative ways. The initial two or three chapters are, in my opinion, a bit tedious in their set-up of later chapters, but the analytic sections in the latter half of the book have no equal in this area. Potter's writing is fun to read, and the examples he uses are sometimes humorous. Fans of Potter's other work will not be disappointed"
5,Excellent sourcebook for tassel making,"The best source for instructions and samples of glamorous tassels. Complete and easy-to-understand instructions for creating and designing all sections of tassels, from cord to skirt. Thanks to the authors for providing this book for tassel lovers."
2,Product is fine but price is not,"I kinda assumed that buying bulk saltines from Amazon would be cheaper than buying in a store, but I should have done my research first. My local Vons had them for half this price (admittedly it was a sale, but not some crazy clearance price. Maybe 20% off). These are great saltines but go buy them elsewhere."
2,Boat worked for about 15 minutes,"Bought this for my son. It was fun...while it worked. It worked great for about 15 minutes and then it no longer went forward. You can only drive it in reverse, which takes the fun out of it. At one point, it didn't work at all then started again. It was very inconsistent. I took it back to the store to purchase a different one."
1,ONLY A SINGLE,didn't know it was just a single---- but if you're looking for remixes of the one song- then *** stars
4,I love music for children,"This man sings FUN!play it in the car, and it makes the timefly and the kids happyI buy them for my grand kids and they loveit"
5,Great Book,"If you are a law student and plan on pursuing a career in patent law, I highly recommend this book. The material is presented in a very clear manner, and the selection of cases is excellent. Perhaps the best textbook that I've read while in law school."
1,This Printer is a stinker!!!!!,I purchased this printer about 4 months ago. First the document feeder stopped working. Then it wouldn't scan the documents so that you could manipulate them. Then about a month ago it wouldn't pull the paper into the printer to print on it. This printer is such poor quality & it really stinks to spend this amount of money & have it basically be a piece of junk in 4 months to the point it doesn't even work hardly at all any more!
2,Printer's challenge,"This product was a challenge to use! There were many nice features, however the problems outweighed the possibilities. Though installation was a breeze,it frequently jammed and then would not pull the paper through the machine. Ink gummed on the roller bar, which made it difficult to operate. I ended up returning this product. A laser printer would most definitely be a better buy in the long run."
1,should have paid attention to the earlier negative review,"This toy simply does not work, and as it was a ""Santa Claus"" present, that made for a big disappointment in our house. Amazon made doing a return very easy, but that does not compensate for ""Santa"" giving such a shoddy product. In contrast, a completely non-electronic skittles set works just like you remember it from childhood. There's a lesson in here somewhere. . ."
3,"OK, flawed software","The keyboard itself is fine. I like the feel of the keys. The programmable keys are pretty good (it'd be nice if more than a few were customizable). My biggest complaint - and it's a big one - is that I've found the Intellitype software (which allows you to program the keys) to be a cause of keyboard system errors (hello blue screen). It's done this multiple times on my Dell WinME system, to the point where I had to get rid of Intellitype for good (the piece of junk - this was the WinME version 1.2). I just use the keyboard without the programmable features, and I like it. However, if I were doing it again I'd get a cheaper (non-programmable) model and save money. Get whatever keyboard has the most comfortable keys for you - Microsoft has competitors too. I know this, Intellitype isn't going anywhere near my system again."
3,THE CLOSEST!!!!,"A lot of people say that this film is the closest in comparison to the novel, I beg to differ!! Yes, the movie does meet some of the standards set by the novel. Yet, a lot of the movie is bad compared to the book. There is a lot added to the movie to make it more dramatic. Like when Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) is killed and Victor (Kenneth Branagh) takes her body and gives her life again (which is what started all the trouble in the first place with the creature). Then she has to chose between Victor and the Creature (Robert de Niro), Finally she breaks a lamp over her head and sets herself and the house on fire. The movie has some good effects and good actors, but the following of the story is bad! I would definitely recommend reading the book before even wasting your time with this movie."
3,The movie was incredibly unfaithful to Mary Shelley's versio,"So the monster really looked like Shelley envisioned, but all of the feminist critiques of society were shamefully left out. Elizabeth is suddenly a strong woman willing to leave Victor when he stalls in marrying her. The DeLancy's are not found in this movie version. And Victor and Elizabeth choose to marry each other, instead of the way Shelley envisioned it, where the mother asks them to marry as she lies on her deathbed. There are many other inconsistancies between this version that claims her name and Shelley's novel. I'm all for changing stories to create new ones, but don't claim something that isn't there."
4,A movie that follows the book,"I read Frankenstein for class and really loved the book. I decided to give the movie a try and love it. It does have some differences, however it stays fairly true to the book."

2,This is very early Benn Hill in B&W.,"Frankly I was dissapointed.I did not realise this was a B&W set of videos from early TV shows. The pictures were grainy, and the comedy was very tame. No bawdy sketches, no T&A like the shows seen on American TV. Unless you are a conossieur, forget it. Also the Good, Bawd and Benny tape sold separately is partr of this collection-ask me how I know!"
5,Good ole Bollywood Movie,"I can't say I personally like this movie, but my parents do and I got it as a gift for my dad. He loves the movie, so 5 Stars from me!"
5,the blues alright,"One of the classic Blues albums of all time. Junior Wells and Buddy Guy really captured the sound of Chicago Blues in this recording. As many have mentioned here already, this really is a gem of an album. I'm not usually one to take any credence from numerated reviews and the like, but I am comfortably assured that this album can get nothing but five as has been testified from the fellow reviews--quality music."
4,Lot Of Bang For The Buck,"I just bought a second set for my new road bike. I've been using this light set on my trail bike which I have been using on both the road and trail for over a year. I find the headlight to be adequate both on and off the road. It's also useful on the road in daylight in flash mode. The flash mode is very visible, even in bright daylight. The taillight is easily visible in both night and bright daylight conditions. Both are easily removable so they can be taken off in seconds when not wanted or needed. Bottom line is that it would be hard to beat the value and usefulness for the price."
4,"Not everyone loves this game, but I do.","Avid gamer; host a group of adults (20's - 40's) to game a few times a month.There are those of us who love it, and those who hate it. I'm among the lovers.It takes a lot of table space. Lots of decks of different cards. Setup can be a little cumbersome. But the play is not too complicated to explain to newbies. Many of the random elements to play affect all players together so it's rare that you feel individually victimized. I really feel immersed in the Aegean culture when playing this game, which is unusual -- few games really pull me in so much.The complaints I've heard is that some feel the play is a little on the slow side. That's probably the result of some complex decision-making. And you can feel a little stymied by bad luck in your oceanic voyages: pirates and storms can prevent you from achieving your goals."
4,The only thing to say,"After all the seminars, tapes, dvds, la te da have been counted, what can we say? ""Every day in every way,"" this book best describes the Silva method."
3,How to Play the Recorder,Purchased as a gift for 6-year old grandson. Biggest issue for him is that the book does not stay open and lie flat.I'm not there to see him practice so I can't really review how well it teaches to play the recorder.
2,Breaks easily,"The belt is nice, however the buckle broke after a week of use. Also, the brown side of the belt is a bit too dark for my taste."
2,Poor Durability,Belt seperated between the black and brown side after one month of normal use. Did look great while it lasted.
2,prefer a flip type,I do not care for the buckle and prefer a flip type of reversible belt buckle. The description did not provide enough info about the type of buckle. I would not have bought the belt if I knew the type of buckle
3,Belt,luv the belt but mine came with A 4 1/2 SCRATCH IN THE BROWN SECTION OR THE RVERSIBLE SIDE OF THE BELT..SO IT WUD LOOK BAD IN THE WRONG LIGHT ...BUT LOOKS GOOD ON..JUST WILL HAVE TO USE THE BLK SIDE..
2,Durability,"IDurability is a concern, the leather started to separate within the first week of wearing it. I was disappointed!!!!!!!I have bought other Kenneth cole belts and they were quite durable so was not please with this one, given the usual standards i'm accustome to with kenneth cole brand."
5,Love it!,"This belt fits all of my needs! I wear it with my dress clothes almost exclusively every day. After over 6 months of use, the belt surface still shows little/no wear and still shines like it is new. The only complaint that I have is that the leather surface is slightly separating from the backing around the edge closest to the hole I use most. This was easily fixed with a dab of super glue though! Go Kenneth Cole!"
1,Worst Belt Ever,"I have been purchasing belts for a long time and various KC belts through the time, this one is by far the worst belt ever. The belt started to separate right down the middle and it just looks awful that I'm just going to trash it! I have three other KC belts and they are great the leather is very different and way better, beyond the quality of this one. I Will Not Recommend anyone Purchasing this belt."
1,Very bad quality,It looked nice when i received it. But it started to split into two parts within few days. Nothing but waste of money. Now i need another belt as it is going into the trash
3,its not big deal,"the buckle is small, it comes with scratches, its not so shiny and nice as it seems the picture. iWould have saved the money for one better"
2,Great looking but not extremely durable,"I enjoyed the styling of this belt while I owned it, but it's not nearly as durable as the typical belt design. If you plan to only wear it for certain occasions and not day to day, it should work for you."
2,Disappointed,The belt buckle arrived with scratches on it and the belt itself had a depression in it....not very good service Amazon!!!! I specifically wanted a reversible belt black/brown...the brown on this belt is so dark there's really no distinction from the black side....so I guess now I'll have to go hunting for a brown belt!
4,A good introduction into the evolution of the classical styl,"The author does an impressive job of showing how the classical style of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven evolved from the musical chaos following the high baroque period. Perhaps giving too little credit to transitional composers who blazed the trail for these three geniuses, Rosen intersperses analysis with superlatives that at times is useful but at other times seems more like hero worship.I found some parts particularly fascinating, such as the comparison between a work by Haydn and C.P.E. Bach. Certainly when the analysis was complete, you could see why Haydn's art was more rational and complete, however Rosen's dismissal of C.P.E. Bach's work as incoherent was somewhat off base in my opinion because the styles and goals of the two composers were not synonymous.Though I didn't always agree with the author's conclusions, this book is still the best out there that I have read on the subject and is well worth reading."
1,"The name's even stupider than the music, This isn't Hardcore!!!","These posers suc. Please people, quit buying and listening to this pure emo-teeny bopper crap. This garbage isn't even hardcore. These posers are soft core wanks. You people don't know anything about hardcore. You want hardcore than check out real hardcore bands who aren't fakes like these posing pathetic emo wanks. Don't waist your time and money. Check out anything from Sick Of It All, Agnostic Front, H20, Murpheys Law, Warzone, Madball, Lord Ezic and the Crown Of Thornz, ...( NYHC) <-- The only scene that deserves the title of Hardcore. Nothing out of New York is Hardcore and that goes for Hatebreed even tho they r friends of Agnostic Front , they r still softees."
2,Learning French,"In French this is what you would call ""pas terrible"" or not so good. The vocals just don't cut it for me. So, why 2 stars? there are two good songs in this album and the rest are like a horror movie."
3,Hmmmmm!,"Well, it's OK, but you should try Coalesce (who were obviously Norma Jean's inspiration). Just as brutal, but much cleverer, and with awesome groove."
1,a disgrace,"1. my connection is fine i have 5 bars connected to my internet yet it is having problems loading the shows2. others are correct with the episodes not in order, in fact, there isnt even the complete series3. most of the time if the show loads it somehow freezes so the audio continues but the video is having troublesi absolutely love this show. i grew up with it but amazon has made this a terrible experience for me."
5,"A ""must"" for all vegetarian kitchens,.","Vegetarian cooks who want to spice up their results using quick, no-cook sauces and dressings will find this an exceptional guide which lacks photos but doesn't need them. From a Maple-Dijon Salad Dressing to a fiery Hot Mustard Plum Dip, this includes a wide range of winners."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I didn't think for a free book that the book would be very entertaining, boy was I wrong. I cried as I read this book, understanding the emotional trials of the characters. If you have a spare rainy day, give this book a try."
2,A little annoying after the first couple of chapters,This book started out ok for me but the constant misunderstandings between Max and Verity were just too much. I found it a little annoying but did finish the book. The end was a little anti-climatic after all of the build up.
3,Taradiddle anyone?,"Worth taking the minute to get the free kindle download. The author is a wonderful writer, and I actually got to use the built-in dictionary a few times to decipher her British-isms (like ""taradiddle."") Quick and escapist, it will leave you smiling. Only 3 stars because the characters got muddled in some unbelievable misunderstandings that left me rolling my eyes at times. If I had bought this in the dead tree version, I would not have kept it for rereading. But it's certainly enjoyable once."
2,"Over ""the great misunderstanding""","Having just read my 3rd Elizabeth Rolls in a row I am well over the 'misunderstanding' plot devise. Why can't people talk to each other properly. Sorry, I thought this book had great potential but I didn't like the way the hero flew off the handle so quickly and for no reason, and the heroine was a little weak. Not a book for me."
3,Big Misunderstanding upon Big Misunderstanding,"I've given His Lady Mistress three stars as a kind of neutral rating. For my personal taste, it would get one star (only because the system doesn't allow for a zero). However, readers who enjoy Big Misunderstanding plots, it might well deserve a higher number of stars than three, because I've never come across so many different ones crammed into 298 pages. For readers who enjoy the Big Misunderstanding compounded by Angst overflowing from their ears, the rating might shoot all the way to the top.Personally, my temptation was just to shoot the hero and heroine, putting them out of their idiotic misery."
3,Too much miscommunication,"I thought the story was decently written with some funny moments and some touching moments. I think the main thing that I got frustrated with in this novel was the constant back and forth of misunderstanding between the hero and heroine. Max is an incredibly great guy, and I liked him as a hero very much. Verity is also sweet, and stoic, and I liked her as the heroine. I think together they would have been much better if they just would have talked to each other once in a while and stopped jumping over each others sentences and jumping to conclusions."
2,His Lady Mistress- 2.5 stars,"I love this period and all it has to offer where romance is concerned. I did however, find myself rolling my eyes with all the misunderstandings. Talk about a lack of communication. Max was this loving character in the beginning, and then when he grows up, he becomes downright cruel to Verity. I'd have left him in a heartbeat after all the drama he puts her through. The tender moments are too few inbetween. For that I give it 2.5 stars"
4,Believable,"This was a good one. I like the story line. However, there are a lot of misunderstandings between characters. Almost too many. Still, I liked the book and the ending was nice."
1,Worst book I've read this year,"I read about a book a day, on average. This was, hands down, the worst of the year. Probably last year & the year before that too. I didn't like the characters or the plot. Even free, it costs too much. I want my time back. I know its gotta be tough to write a book, and I doubt I could do it, so I try hard to give authors a break, even if I don't really like the book. Unfortunately, I just really hated this one, which is rare for me."
3,Well worth it's price,"I didn't expect much from this book being as it's a free read. But the book had a lot of potential. Just didn't make it for me though. The heroin was a wimping crybaby and there was so much miscommunication that it got a little ridiculous. It started off good but the more I read, the more I was waiting for it to end. I gave the book 3 stars only because it's free so it's not like I'm wasting money. Just time. Elizabeth, word of advice, don't make your characters so weak minded and make it more realistic. And what's up with your spelling? Spell check wouldn't have hurt either."
1,IT WAS FREE,IT WAS A OK. I WOULD PAY MONEY FOR THIS STORY. GOOD THING IT WAS FREE IF NOT I WOULD BE UPSET
1,Hero is not heroic,"I was disappointed by this book. I got it as a free Kindle book and glad I didn't pay for it.This hero is the biggest jerk.... He hates all women (of course) and only uses them for pleasure (of course) and thinks all women want his money (of course) and constantly thinks the worse of the heroine... and interprets every action as being evil.... until the lightening bolt from the sky and he caves in.... [[snap]] like that... and realizes how wrong he's been and how much he loves her.... and can he hope to salvage his marriage....Oh... and heroine.... she's not good enough for the hero... never.... because of some small indiscretion committed by her (""He will hate me when he learns the truth,"" sob...)"
4,Good Read,This was my first read on my Kindle. It's a good read for those of us who enjoy historical romances.
4,Verity falls in love with Max over her father's grave.,"This is a classic Cinderella story, sort-of. Verity is shuffled off to her uncles home after her father takes his life. Her unlce family is just a bit odd though. She's not treated as part of them she's treated worse than the servants - she's even forced to give up her name and use another. Until years later when Max comes to check on her.However, the plot does take a few steps up from that. Max wants Verity as his mistress - until he finally figures out who she is. Then he takes her as his wife but for all of the wrong reasons.Some parts of this book are really silly, some are a bit slow but overall - if you can stay interested enough to get though those parts and continue to read - it's really not a bad book. Though I will admit that the characters could have a bit more personality than they seem to."
2,As many books...,"As many books this one started like a pro. Albeit the first book's part is like Cinderella is sort of thrilling. As you keep reading and extricate the plot, fibs and secrets you'll bore once and again. At the book's end you'll ask yourself: Why I finished this book?"
2,Just have a conversation already,"It was pretty good, but alot of it could have been settled by a simple conversation. I know there is some misunderstanding to books, but this was crazy!!"
4,Did the job,Job well done. this is a decent quality cable that feels sturdy and does what it's supposed to do. I'd buy it again if i had another project involving composite cables.
4,I enjoy a Magickal Mystery,I really enjoyed both of the Rowan Gant mysteries. They hold you to the end with no difficulty. I look forward to reading more of them and tell my friends about them.
1,Not what I was expecting...,"Please don't be fooled by the blurb on the back of the book. This is NOT about a mysterious sea creature. Oh, sure, it makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the book but then disappears until a VERY brief mention in the last chapter.The characters were not only mostly annoying but one-dimensional. And how much sense does it make to bring a 17 yr old down to an undersea research habitat and then onboard a research submarine? And what was with the minor storyline of the scientist trying to sell out his company? I honestly saw no point to that.And the editing...or shall I say the lack of editing...the blatant mistakes everywhere in this book were laughable.I admit I read the entire book hoping the monster lover in me would be rewarded for her perseverence. Alas, that was not to be. It was a waste of my time. I give you fair warning."
3,3.5 stars-fun quick read,"Alan steele has crafted a fun and interesting story that gives you a good feel for the ocean depths in which his characters interact. There a few high points of excitement but mostly this is a book where characters have to make very human decisions: one man decides whether or not he should cheat on his wife, another whether to betray industrial secrets. All of these scenes were well done but not extremely profound. The strongest part of the book is the atmosphere, you feel the depths and are lured by the mystery of the ocean. While this book is by no means a great piece of sci-fi it is well worth picking up a copy. The main reason being that this book never tries to be more than it is, which is an enjoyable night's read."
2,Inelegant proof at best,"The description and reviews are enough to rate this. Any intellectually astute atheist since Spinoza could tell you absolute freedom was impossible, and determinism has been defeated both mathematically and by quantum mechanics. No recondite postmodern obfuscation is necessary."
1,"Looks good, but not durable",The thumb press broke (it's plastic) after light use. Too bad because the rest of the unit is pretty nice. They should have used metal for this part. I see other reviewers have also had this part break. I would buy it again if they changed the design of this part.
2,disappointed,I used the decorator a couple of times before the lever broke. It is very difficult to use now. I am very disappointd with this product.
1,No practical advice included.,"This books is written in a critical spirit. It describes all the negatives influences for a negative Christian young man, but aside from decrying absentee fathering, gives no step by step direction for raising GODLY sons. What a shame....."
1,Word to the Wise: Don't Waste Your Money On This One!,"First of all, the fights aren't all that great; the camera work, audio recording, & lighting is sub-par, and it just screams ""cheap-azz production quality"" from the get-go.Secondly, the DVDs are apparently of very poor quality themselves. I received the initial version, and it was completely unwatchable. The constant pixelation, jerkiness, video/audio dropouts, etc. made any attempt to watch the event almost unbearable. The seller provided me a replacement (no charge, quick shipping; thanks ""2ndchancebooks""!) but it wasn't much better. At that point I just threw in the towel and gave up.Just say no to this turkey..."
2,For Die-Hard Fans,I love everything about baseball and there are some good stories in here. But I don't like the format of a bunch of one paragraph stories. For die-hard baseball fans only.
5,"A fascinating, poetic story of one man's search for his past","Who was Lorna Moon? And why did she abandon him? These are just a few of the questions Cecil B. de Mille's son Richard explores in the most absorbing biography of the year. His quest takes him from Hollywood to Canada and a small village in Scotland, and nets him a sister, a brother, cousins galore, and family secrets some didn't want revealed. It is both lyrical and tragic and his father and uncle would have been proud."
4,Godzilla 2000 dvd - EASTER EGG Japan version,"We all were looking forward to the Japanese verion with english subtitles and the additonal 9 minutes on this DVD. Well it may be there in the form of an easter egg. On the main menu - you will see ""midnight Club"" - can you get there? Why is it there??? Does this unlock the Japanese movie version????All in all the american version is good and Zilla is back the way he should be! NO Sony ""atomic lizard"" but the man in the suit!Also like all Sony DVD's this one defaults to Dobly Pro Logic - so do not forget to do the Audio Set-up and put it in Digital Dobly 5.1"
2,Accidentaly rented the wrong movie.,"I made a huge mistake when I rented this pathetic movie at the video store. I meant to order Godzilla with Matthew Broderick. But instead rented this terrible Japanese film. To be honest with you it's hard for me to review this terrible movie because it just didn't make much sense to me. The dialog was so bad it seemed like it was written by a kid in grade school. Actually i'm giving the dialog too much credit, I don't want to insult any grade schoolers out there. Truthfully I believe a kindergartener could have written better dialog. This film was in the fantasy section in the video store, but it should have been in the comedy section because all I did throughout the whole movie was laugh. The special effects were pretty cool in a corny kind of way, but unless you can appreciate a movie with good special effects and not much of a storyline this movie isn't for you."
4,At least Toho can still be the American Godzilla,Better than the NEW YORK GODZILLA! You have to be on crack to like the American Godzilla. I just hated that i had no idea where this movie left off. Godzilla appears out of nowhere and fights an alien..the end..... i don't get it...do you people? Wheres the story? But oh well becuasei t had moments like the orginal series and better effects. At Least Toho is slowly improving. Yet one side of me liked it when toho's movies were crappy looking......hmmmm......
1,... OFF,"Just a warning, this DVD DOES NOT contain the Japanese version, only the EDITED and POORLY DUBBED American version."
4,One of the very best Godzilla sequels!,"For me, this is one of the 2 or 3 best Godzilla sequelsout of ALL the post 1956 versions so far(with 2001's ""Giant Monsters All-Out-Attack"" beingperhaps the best).The Alien rock subplot works pretty well, IMO,and adds interest to the main story.It's fun and works well as sci-fi action-entertainment, IMHO.But, let's face it--You are eithera Kaiju person (""Kaiju""=Giant Monster Movie), or not.If you ARE (or are curious), this one isdefinitely worth your attention."
2,I am biased...,"...against the dubbed Godzilla films.With the advent of DVD technology as well as movie-goers who can read, I was hoping that Godzilla 2000 would be released in the form in which it was first released: that is, in Japanese. And with English subtitles. After securing a few ""G"" films in their original language I cannot watch dubbed and ""edited for Americans"" versions. I found the dubbed voices, even if they ""matched,"" to be so annoying, so insulting, so distracting... that the experience was painful.Story-wise, it's OK, but lacks the surprising sophistication of G vs. Biolante (Japanese-language version/English subtitles). Suit-wise, I didn't like it, but since this is G-Jr. of G vs. Destroyah I understand. General-effects wise, the monster battles in this one are anemic.END"
3,good book,This was a good book. It was an easy read for my students and helped them understand the holiday. Thanks!
5,Our Favorite Lego Set!,"We have been building Lego sets with our children for over ten years. There isn't a Birthday or Holiday that goes by that doesn't include a Lego set...big or small. That said, the Star Wars Millenium Falcon has been the most challenging and fun to build to date (the Lego Castle of Morcia a close second). Construction of this 985 piece set was time consuming (about eight hours), but once completed has also been the most fun to play with. The Millennium Falcon's ""roof"" opens exposing control panels, an escape pod, turret, cockpit, and more. The set also includes Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO, and a Storm Trooper. This set is a perfect companion to the Tie Fighter (which comes with Darth Vader). I rated this product a 4 for durability not because the Legos themselves are problematic, but becuase when the Millenium Falcon is complete it is somewhat fragile."
3,thin mat,"This is a nice looking item, but is very thin. The wind whips it around with the top down. I'll just have to use it to keep my feet off the concrete in the garage."
5,This feels like paradise! (just to speak as Yngwie...),"This album was produced For the love of god! it will make you sleep between Erotic nightmares, dance like a Ballerina, you will discover Love Secrets and taste an Alien water kiss... this is not just greasy kid's stuff, it's blue powder, it's all the Answers you've always looked for! In this album steve showed the Animal who's inside of him to the Audience who's listening... together with his Sisters 'Sex & religion' and 'Alien love secrets' he will show you Liberty, you will listen to whatever you ever Would have loved to listen, and you will never get Rid of this album! ""walking the fine line between great technique and incredible ideas!""buy it."
4,A french review,"Except liberty, this album is very esoteric. Passion and warfare is the masterpiece of vai. If you are guitarist, you must have it. Be careful, sometimes it's not easy to handle..."
4,Impressive technique and imagination -- not easy listening,"More interesting that Satriani's Surfing with the Alien. Vai is undoubtedly one of the most technically able guitarists of all time -- but is it good music? Is it melodic? That is obviously a personal taste issue -- but I think many will find this challenging, possibly unpleasant even. That said, it is very impressive and imaginative (making the guitar gurgle like a small baby or a naughty school boy for example). There is little restraint shown here -- this is extreme guitar. It could well be that most mere mortals are unable to appreciate the full sophistication of Mr. Vai's genius, or perhaps he is just a ""stunt guitarist"", or perhaps a little of both. [Odd moment recently seen on video: Steve Vai playing at Les Paul's shoulder during Les Paul anniversary/birthday(?) celebration jam. You know what Les says about modern speed guitarists -- typified one might think by Steve]."
4,Technically Great but musically mediocre album,"""For the Love of good"" is probably the only musically good number.He has put in a lot of passion into this I am sure.The rest of the album is average sounding.Might have something to do with my taste too.Music should also matter as much,if not more, than the technical wizardy. Vai can do better,I bet."
4,"More than just ""Okay"" ...","Whitey's spitifire-ish, danceable ode to an unfaithful lover (bad boy Bobby, perhaps?). This song, taken from her 1998 album 'My Love Is Your Love', enjoyed a vast amount of air play and club play during 1999. Features the original radio edit plus three exciting remixes."
4,A useful critique of college life,I found this book a useful summary of what freshmen might face in college. I have given (1st edition) copies to graduating high school seniors for a few years. Their feedback has told me that the inconsistant thinking described in the book is alive and well.
2,Not my idea of a spacebattle game,"Being an avid fan of Star Fox from Nintendo 64, I was hoping to find something similar on xbox. The only similarity Jedi Starfighter offers is the incessant whining and stupid chatter you get on the radio from your annoying allies. They make you want to desert and join the enemy.Besides that, this game is nothing but aim and shoot. That's it. In Star Fox you had to learn trick flying so you could fly between buildings and under bridges, maneuver around obstacles and outfox your attackers. You were looping and dodging the whole time while you shot at bogies, like an old-fashioned fighter plane dogfight.In Jedi Starfighter you don't even get the feeling your ship is in motion. It's like you're almost stationary, turning around in circles looking for stuff to shoot at, which to me gets really boring in a short amount of time. Reminds me of 1980's technology.Lame, lame, lame."
4,Witness,"This is a book that I purchased for someone else. I'm not reading it so I can't really say, but I think it's fine because they requested it."
5,Witness,"The book is written about 1952 which makes it sound like old stuff, not relevant. Not true. It is not only interesting and well written but it gives insight into the mind set of Socialists/Communists and liberal.Most of the people who fit those categories do not even know that they have embraced the philosophy of ""From Each According To His Ability, and to each according to their need"". It is OK with them to use the power and force of government to transfer wealth from those who produced it to those who didn't.I am half way through it and can't hardly put it down.Jack KitchensKuna, Idaho"
5,"Very detailed, excellent advice.","I bought this book for a bargain (under 5 dollars) and wondered if I was wasting my money. Why was this book selling for so cheap when I couldn't even find a copy of the South Beach Diet on my local store bookshelves?I was pleasantly surprised at how much sense this book made. And how much detailed information and explanations were given. I really think anyone could benefit (even people who are not overweight) and everyone should read it. It's like a primer for your health.The only complaint I have is that so many statistics are thrown at you, and I'm not convinced they are all soundly presented. For example: Cancer deaths are increasing... Well maybe that is true, but are the rates increasing? I mean the population is growing exponentially, so even if the number of deaths are increasing, the rate could be decreasing.But overall I rate this a must for all persons interested in their health and fitness."
3,Ordinary Video Game,"We got this for my teenage son, who played it once and never touched it again. Just not exciting enough, I guess. He had been asking for it, so I was surprised when he didn't enjoy it."
2,Not worth the price,"I paid full price for these and have only kept them because of the small satellite speakers and the shape of the subwoofer; these just happened to fit the spaces I had.There is little midrange. For as large a subwoofer as this is, the actually output is quite muddy and getting the right balance can be difficult. There is no left right balance or general tone control...the bass level is on the back of the subwoofer (very bad idea).For my setup, having the main level and power on a remote control was perfect, since the speakers are not in arms reach, which is where most systems have the controls.I would look at other systems unless the specific design features are essential, as they were for me."
2,A new low for A.L.,"Its not so much that these are low quality speakers--the sats have survived many drop tests. And they're actually pretty loud. The problem lies in the use of multiple small drivers in the sats rather than a 2-way high/mid configuration. Also, the subwoofer, while powerful, has horrible clarity. The result is lacking midrange and muddy bass--acceptable for games, but certainly not for music.Also, the 1/8"" inputs kept giving me trouble. They'd come loose at random. I suspect they were defective. In any case, I replaced them with 1/4"" jacks. Problem solved.If you're a gamer, don't plan to listen to music, and you can find a really good deal on these, they might be an okay choice. I got mine free, and given that, I'm happy enough with them. But, they're certainly not worth the retail price. Do yourself a favor and buy some quality speakers from Klipsch or Telex."
3,great system for your money,"this speaker system is excellent for the price. The subwoofer pumps out great bass, and the speakers give off crisp sound. If you listen closly you can tell that they struggle slightly at mid range but overall very good sound. The only con. to this system is that they don't have a headphone jack which on most computers doesn't make a difference because of front panel audio but it is still a nice feature. This is the best speaker system i think that you can buy for the cost."
3,Nothing new but it's not bad either,"I've been a Dokken fan for years and waited anxiously for this release. There are a few very good tracks, ""Change the World"" and ""Voice of the Soul"", a few good tracks ""Maddest Hatter"" and ""Erase the Slate"" and the rest of the album goes down hill from there. Dysfunctional sounds far more contemporary and progressive than this CD, which makes it clear Dokken is content on putting out dated generic music."
5,lynch needed lynching,"Out with Lynch, in with Beach. THIS IS THE BEST DOKKEN ALBUM EVER! AND WHAT BETTER TIME THAN 1999. DOKKEN HAS EVOLVED MUSICALLY AND LYRICALLY. THIS SOUNDS AWESOME. MADDEST HATTER AND DROWN ARE THE HIGHPOINTS TO ME. I SUGGEST EVERYONE PICK THIS ALBUM UP AND ROCK TO IT. SAY GOODBYE TO MR. SCARY. REB BEACH HAS TAKEN OVER THE THRONE"
3,Reb Beach?,"Listening to this makes me realize that Jon Levin is indeed the best choice for post-Lynch Dokken. I hear some Winger references in Beach's playing, and I really dont want to be reminded of Winger. Lynch's sound was crisp and hard; perfect for Dokken, and no one comes close to his tone, except Levin. The Billy White/John Norum duo for Dokken's solo album sounded better than Reb Beach's tone also. Beach is great, but not for Dokken music."
1,Just Aweful,I had this a total of five days before it broke. I sent it in to be fixed. They sent it back a month later. It still didn't work and I have to send it back again. I think they are trying to outlast the three month warranty. You are better off paying a few more dollars for a more reliable player. This has been a total headache and a waste of money.
1,Too many problems,"I have had this MP3 player for several months. I was able to deal with the the machine freezing (by keeping a paper clip handy and pressing the reset button). I also had a lot of patience when entire cd's were mysteriously disappearing and I had to upload the cd's again. Now, the scroll pad/volume bar is not working at all rendering this player practically useless. (If I select ""All"" I can hear each song on every CD in alphabetical order but that's about it.)I'm trying to figure out if I can send this in for repair or just consider it useless and go for the Toshiba Gigabeat (30 GB) which seems to be pretty reliable.I received the Iriver as a gift but wouldn't dare buy any of their products and would strongly advise anyone else against throwing their money away on Iriver."
1,Dont let the cover fool you!,"The cover of this game looks like the ones by take two interactive.Dont let that fool you. This game is nothing like the other ones. It is in a word, RIDICULOUS. I didn't know mario was a ranger! If you are 12 years old or younger you might like it. I didn't even get past the training mission, and I shut it off! Dont judge a book by it's cover!! BOOOOOO!!!!"
2,I disagree.,"We used a chapter from this book for my graduate Philosophy of mind class. To be fair, I must note that I was not favorably disposed towards eliminative materialism to begin with (nor any other materialism, really). My preference aside, though, I found at least this chapter (#2) to be rife with misunderstandings of other fields like AI and neuroscience. Even when you are generous to Churchland's arguments, they often turn out to not be arguments at all. Granted, issues like materialism, mentalism, and dualism are difficult to find solid ground on. What I object to is that he portrays as crystal clear arguments which aren't even logical, even if you grant his premises are true (which they often aren't). Obviously I can't give an in-depth criticism here, but I have a short paper on the topic. Anyways, you may want to find a more complete and more careful text. It succeeded in provoking thought, but I was dissapointed in the quality of the author's thought."
3,Not the best quality.....,"This robe is not the best quality but for the price you get what you get. My real complaint is that it was a bit short on my husband and he is only 5'10"""
2,cheap quality,"it is not even a ""clothes"" made of fabrics. the materials are like those for elastic leggings... very disappointed.... returning it"
3,Returning It,"I agree with some reviews that this is a ""cheap costume."" I've seen excellent quality but can't afford it for Halloween. I'm having to return it though due to size. I'm a 5'4"" tall woman who wears a size 10-12. This was so long in the sleeves and so big that it hung on me and dragged the floor by about 2-3 inches. I just couldn't wear it to the party I bought it for. I hope this review helps if you're similar sized. This actually fit my 6'4"" tall, size 34 husband perfectly. Too bad he didn't want to be Harry Potter this year!"
2,poor quality,"The product has a cheap feel and was unraveling in spots. The sewing was poor and the material was not good. The clasp that closes the robe in the front is too heavy for the cheap fabric, so it never looked right. This robe was a terrible buy. I would have happily spent more money for a better made one if I had known what this one was like. Utter garbage. Also, the lining of the inside of the hood is mauve. It really clashed with my accessories (scarf and tie) that were the actual colors. Do not buy this robe."
2,Harry Potter Adult Robe,"This robe has an unfinished (un-hemmed) bottom, and the side hem stitching came out on the first day it was worn! It's a piece of crap!"
3,Purple,"First of all, the robes in the movies are pure black so I don't recommend a colored one in the first place. But if you do get a red hooded one, this one is definitely purple. Gryffindor colors are gold and red."
3,Could be better,"I read almost all of the reviews and had a pretty good idea of what to expect, so I can't say I was disappointed. However, it would be nice if there was some intermediate thing between this and the $300 version. Or heck, for those of us who sew....a pattern!"
1,why not read the actual book,"let me first say one thing. I AM NOT A MORMON. now that that is out of the way, I must say that this book is not a good reference to truly discover the beliefs of the Mormons. I have often studied the religon, listened to the ""elders"" and read their book. But one thing that I can never understand is why people need to read books such as this to discover the truth of their message. Why not actually read the Book of Mormon? Why not go to their church? I have. But I am still contemplating their message. Books like this only annoy those who are actually looking for truth. Why not go to the source. It is always the best way to go. Do not buy this book for reference. It is terrible!"
1,Offensive to Christians,"As a Christian, I was offended by the antagonistic stance of this book. Read the Bible and try to find common ground, not battleground. I have mormon friends and we share a love of Jesus"
1,Mormon's questions unanswered,"I thought from the title this would be a thoughtful consideration of mormonism, but instead found it to be a rabid anti-mormon harangue, full of distortions and outright untruths. This is a very bad book and could seriously mislead anyone desiring serious information about mormon history and beliefs. I hope such people will go elsewhere for information. This author has a hatred which is difficult to understand."
1,Unbalanced and Unfair,"Those who think this book is a good means by which to learn about the faith of their Latter-day Saint neighbors should also, to be consistent, read Madalyn Murray O'Hair or Bertrand Russell or Friedrich Nietzsche (outspoken atheists all) to learn about Christianity. Of course, they will object, reading such folk for an understanding of Christianity would be misguided and absurd. Precisely my point."
2,Dirty Politics a way of life,"I thought I would read this book, a gift. Once I start to read, I do not stop. Even though I have many books written much better than this. This is third of a series of three. All I can say, read this forget the others. The series is not worth anyone's time. It shows the inside of a dirty political race (and trys to say this is how theyare all run). I am sorry to say it is probably so.Not a very exciting read. Pick up any other book and you'll probably be happier. Unless you wish to go into politics...then read it."
4,The story continues,"In this book we look at Dr. Montgomery Montgomery and Count Olaf, now desquised as Stephano, who has returned in an attempt to get at the Baudelaire orphans and get his hands on their inheritance. Like the first book in the series the Reptile Room is a wonderful read and entertaining for adults as well as children. And on top of this we get to learn about Zombies in the Snow, a movie we'll no doubt hear more about in the future."
2,Leave this one on the shelf,"I read this one for free online...boring. I have to mention I went to IU with this joker and he had an attitude with nothing to back it up. NO brains (just man boobs), just a talker, talker, talker. Graduated IU law, but last I heard had still not gained admission to any state's bar. With all of his ass kissing I can say that so many other former students and myself think he still has his nose lodged in at least one Professor's rear."
3,One song almost saves the album,"Another reviewer labeled his ""What a letdown"" and I have to agree. While I have a blind allegience to the GVB, I honestly cannot recommend this album. Buy ""I Do Believe"" and ""God is Good"" and revel in incredible quartet stylings and great songs with some of the most uplifting melodies and messages you'll ever hear. This album sounds like Bill let the freshman 'Commercial Composition and Arranging' class at Trevecca Nazarene College make the CD. I will give one concession to Russ Taff; while I have never cared for him as a soloist, he actually blends better and gives more color to the group than Mark Lowry did. However, Mark was as good a soloist as Guy Penrod and therefore is greatly missed."
1,A must read but only in Spanish,"Pedro Páramo is a beautifully written novel, in Spanish. In Spanish, the narration of Juan Preciado is lyrical, stark, simple and engaging. This translation makes the narrative sound like a female voice, and American, and there are mistakes in it that are unforgiveable. It lacks the hypnotic lyricism of the original. One leaves this translation with the thought that the translator neither understood Spanish well enough to do justice to the original, which is a masterpiece, nor could she write well enough in English to have attempted it. Translation is an art, but the translator should be like the lighting director in a theatre, someone you don't see but whose work makes magic."
4,A look into a bigger subtext,"Juan Rulfo's journey into Comala is far more than a journey home. It is an tale of family, love, lust,revenge and misfortune. Rulfo's style is far from conventional standards, providing a distraction from a typical plot and narrative. Rulfo surprises and entices the reader into a story worth reading."
5,Al vs. Ermias,"Before you go thinking, "" Well these reviews don't help much"" it's best u get a teenager's opinion. Ermias, the one who gave this book a single star is a high school student. LITTERALLY. He and I are Juniors and as part of our IB Program, we are forced to read a book in English 11 that is somewhat beyond our current ""in the box"" thinking. Don't shy away from this book just because it sounds complicated. It's got mystery, passion, some action and everything else needed to make the greatest book of 20th century novel. Rulfo wrote this small 100 some page novel and won the nobel prize. Yeah it's that good. Teenagers have a hard time appreciating it, because we have less time than your average adult. I would list what we do but thats for another time. So take your time and read with an open mind."
2,Confusing,"Perhaps I am just not ""surreal"" enough to comprehend this kind of work but, regardless, I was completely lost while reading this book. From what I have read, disorienting his reader was one of Rudalfo's intentions, but it didn't work for me. It was one of those book that I continually had to re-read sections of to try to orient myself in the story and I was never able to."
1,way to confusing!!!,this book is way to confusing when you read it. You must keep detailed notes of everything just to get some points.
1,Save your money! I wish I would have!!!!,"I purchased this DVD based on some of the reviews. I am an avid exerciser and love to find new DVD's that are challenging. Boy was I sorry I spent the twenty dollars plus shipping and handling on this one. It is terrible. The set is horrible, the instructor has a mousy voice that is barely audible and the man who works out behind her looks like he is tired and just wants to lay down and take a nap! The instructor looks awkward when throwing punches, all the moves are so boring, and the music is even worse. Save your money, if you want a really great aerobic workout with kickboxing moves go for the Tae-Bo tapes, or Kathy Smith's kickboxing video, they have motivating instructors, great music, and visually appealing workout sets."
5,Fantastic Product!,"This product is so unbelievably convenient. You just position it, pee, roll it up, and toss it. The gel turns the urine into a solid, so you don't have to worry about the T-John leaking once you trash it. No more nasty porto-potties! No more nasty toilet water backsplash from public toilets! Great for germa-phobes!"
4,Great when you're stuck in traffic!,These are handy to have around when your stuck in traffic and/or do alot of driving.
1,Garbage!,"I have read ALL of Alistair MacLean's novels, multiple times, and am also a five-time-published author. I don't know who ""Alastair MacNeill"" is but his writing is horrible and he and the publisher (and anyone else involved in allowing Mr. MacLean's name to be remotely attached to this trash) should be flogged. With all of the good writers out there trying to find publishers, how in the world did this hack get a contract?"
3,ITS ALRIGHT GET IT IF ITS CHEAP,"THIS game is alright,it is a Clone of the Driver family(not a good,though),though it is the same idea.The `Main Menu` is deffinatly copying Driver because of the way it is set out and the same options,with different names(obviously).The main game is easy but the Police don`t try just to bash you they pen down your Licence Plate no. and if they get it all""YOU`RE NICKED!`.They do actually go after u 4 no reason even if you are driving along the right places ect. they still chase you and they arnt even Patroling they are parked some where so they can getchu.This game is set on the original ""The Italian Job"" movie that was made by the British movie makers and has the Mike Caine voices in it.This stook more close to the Driver family then to the film and i like Driver 1,2 and 3 better because you get more cities,more miles of road,driving techniques and Some movie style features though you get Driving mini games on this.BYE"
3,An ok game,"Sure, this game is only $$$, and I did have fun playing it, but it was greatly disappointing. You aren't able to look behind you, which really hurts the game play, the graphics aren't very great either. It may only be $$$, but it could have been done way better even though it is selling for just that. For a cheap game where you get to run from the cops, I might recomend it, but I'd stick with driver any day."
4,Live versions are fabulous,"This disc contains Satrianis live recordings which show his talent (no mistakes) and his approach to his music - express your self freely, you don't have to play songs exactly the same that you have before. Technics are clear. The intros and outros are fun to hear as he does allmost all his lightning fast technics in them.Disc one is a bit so and so. First couple of tracks are ok to good but the last one (Woodstock Jam) is horrible. CD also displays Joes earlier playing. Good package"
2,Uhhh.. I dunno...,"Well, concert performances are fabulous I admit, but I felt like, Joe didn't try as hard as he does usually, in studio works... Like, he recorded these stuff in one boring studio day... Perhaps greatest disappointment since the song called ""snake"""
4,"I love this book, but.....","I have the utmost respect for Ann Wigmore because she was the one who started it all when it comes to a raw food diet. I wish I had known about her years ago. I have this book as well as others by Ann Wigmore, I also have videos of hers but I never use any of them.Raw food recipes have come a long way since the Ann Wigmore days. Although many of them have gotten away from being as healthy as Ann's were, the recipes are much more palatable.It is very difficult to jump into a lifestyle of raw and living foods with the recipes in this book.I wouldn't take anything for my copy but don't really recommend to newbies because you may get discouraged if you try these. In just starting out I would recommend Annie Phyio or Matthew Kenney. Alissa Cohen is good if you like a lot of nuts and don't want to lose weight. Rhonda Malkmus is good if you just want to go 80% raw and the other being a healthy cooked 20%."
5,Don't plan a trip to WDW without this book!,"I can't say it any better than the title. This book gives great tips about everything inside and outside of the park. In parts it's a little over the top, but definately worth the extra cash to make sure you think of everything to make your WDW trip perfect."
4,Walt Disney Unofficial Guide 2007,We purchase this book everytime we are planning a trip to Disney worldIt is very informative and very helpfulGranted we just went to Disney in 2006 so the 2007 edition was pretty much the same as the 2006 edition-I would definitely pick this Disney guide over many of the others-
3,Disney World Guide,"This is a comprehensive guide to the enormous vacation spot known as ""Disney world."" We were able to check out all the restaurants and make early reservations before our last trip. My principal concerns were the very small print and low color contrast in the print. Anyone with any reading problems (such as myself) would not find it convenient to use."
2,Too MUCH information,"I bought this guide to Disneyworld this time. In the past, I've used the Birnbaum book. This guide has small print, and way more information than I wanted. I really don't want to know the square footage of the rooms. I'm sure the info is factual, but for some reason, there's so much of it to wade through, and much of the details were extraneous to me. The Birnbaum book cuts to the chase - easier reading and more practical advice. Buy the Birnbaum book, not this one, unless you are obsessed with details. I just want to go and have fun, the easiest way. This book was more complicated than estate planning!"
5,Buy this book before you plan your disney vacation,"I would highly recommned this book! Unfortunately, I bought it after we had booked our trip. This book would also be extremely helpful to buy before you book any rooms or airlines. We visited Disney World the week after Christmas, which this books recommends not doing. However with the help of this book we were able to save over $200 on a rental car and avoided long lines within the parks. So, it will pay for itself in the money that you save using their tips.So...1. Buy the book before you plan your Disney vacation2. Follow this books guidelines3. Use their companion web-site to print out touring plans for each day you are in the parks.4. Don't go to the parks during major holidays. They are way too crowded!You should also know that I have a Type A personality, so I like planning most of the details of a trip before I go."
5,Great Travel book,This is by far my favorite travel guide to Walt Disney World. The writers make totally unbiased comments. A must have.
1,Don't waste your money!,THIS GAME IS NO GOOD! The case lies and shows that there is neat graphics for the game when actually it is a blur! The people are really fuzzy. The action is sluggish and the people move slowly. The introduction is cool but unfortunately that is the best part...it all goes downhill from there. Don't waste your money on this game. EA can do better than this!
3,try max 8 miles,None of these radios perform as they say based the mileage. Assume 1-8 miles unless you buy something totally different.
5,Good product and performance,Works very well. Be careful putting it down when in the woods... you will lose it because of the camoflauge color.I have lost one already due to the camoflaug color but I hope to have solved that by wrapping florescent orange tape around the antenna.Range is very good. Battery life is also good. I wish light on the chargers would go out when the batteries are charged but it doesn't.
5,Very Good Buy,"An excellent buy for the price. The 22 mile range could be misleading to someone not familiar with radio communications, about 2 miles is a more accurate estimate in the real world. I bought them for our motorcycles and am very pleased with the quality, reception and features.As a comparison motorcycle shops sell GMRS based communication units in the range of $250.00 to $375.00 EACH!Fantastic product for the money."
2,Not Recommended...,"I had a huge issue with pilling as well - it made the sheets incredibly uncomfortable, not smooth at all. Plus, it seemed to create a magnet for cat hair. After owning the sheets for six months, I just threw them away."
2,More lint than sheet,"The sheets were soft, the color lovely. Alas, when washed in cool water they lost much of their substance in the washer and dryer. They're now far thinner and far less lovely in color. They are sure to meet an untimely death."
4,Great Quality and good price,The quality of sheet set is really good. It gets softer with each wash. The color is very beautiful. I absolutely love it.
5,Wonderful Historical Romance,"I loved this book. Ms. Ware drops one into the eighteenth century with the first paragraph. The characters were engaging and the romance was heartfelt. I immediately searched out background on Jane Maxwell after finishing - I didn't want the story to end.My only issue was the Kindle formatting. I had paid $7.99, not $2.99, and for the price I expected a more professional presentation."
4,Very good,"""Island of the Swans"" is not an easy read. You don't know who to root for, you don't know who is to blame or who to hate. There is not a clear winner/loser/hero(ine)/villain. I enjoyed this book, but I felt a little cheated. I read the WHOLE thing, being pulled this way and that by each character, only to come to the end and not even get a fulfilling ending?!"
1,Soft Porn meets Eighth Grade History,"This is not historical fiction but soft porn. The plot is unbelievable, and it is simply trash. Phylippa Gregory it is NOT. Don't waste your money."
1,Get what you pay for,"Dear Taxcut,Please refund my purchase price of taxcut. I am not satisfied with the product. The auto install of the upgrade did not work . I download manually after 45 minutes was able to install update. The program will not e-file with warnings, even though I said my W-2 was OK. It or I had problems with 401k and Roth IRA distributions. After 3 hours of work, I have to start over and went to bed at 11:30 so I was late for work. I thought I would give Taxcut a try because I've used Tubotax for years.Going back to Turbotax. The uncluttered part of Taxcut is good, but it has to be clear and work! The help files were too messy also."
1,"No valuable Help, Questionable calculations","TaxCut Deluxe 2003. In filling out the Interviews, this app stops with my 1099-MISC at Box 7, with error requiring a code.But no where could I find a hint as to what the code may be.The app suggested I refer to an IRS Publication xxxxxx! If I had time to get all the IRS publications, I would not need a tax software application!I decided to continue, by omitting the two 1099-MISC documents, and see what happened. Well at the end it calculated a very nice refund....But, I went out and purchased TURBO TAX 2003 and re done the whole thing. The 1099-MISC Box 7 had no error issues, and when I completed the filing, TURBO TAX 2003 came up with a lot less refund. The two 1099-MISC's I omitted in TaxCut 2003 totaled $1600. So there is no way that would have resulted in some $2000 less in my refund!TaxCut Deluxe 2003 is a waste of money in my opinion."
1,Novelty,This item is a novelty. Like one of those cheap piggy banks. It is cheap and would only work for a fun toy for a kid to practice with.
3,Not his best,"I've read all his books now and in my opinion, this wasn't his best. Sure, the story itself is great but it was just too much like a scan of what had happened in his life. From the part where he finds out that his father is a murderer, it started to get boring. I guess it's because I had really enjoyed the beginning when he talked about how much his father had loved him and what his father would do, just to please him."
3,Good but not the greatest,"This CD is OK but not Tim's greastest by far. Search his other CD's for the really good tunes like ""Acid Country"", ""Clean Underware"" and ""First Baptist Bar and Grill""."
4,Interesting Read,"This book offers a fascinating explanantion of the creation story for our universe, our galaxy, our planet and its inhabitants. The expressions remind me of those in Emmanuel Swedenborg's 'Heaven and Hell'. It is an interesting contrast to more modern channeled creation texts such as Ra The Law of One, or Voyagers, or the Hathor material."
5,This thing rocks!,Thing is cool! We dropped it on the floor and it only one piece broke off! Buy it! It's cheap to buy but not to play with!
3,The Bravest DVD.....,"I watched the show religiously each night it was on. Here in Seattle that was at 0000 on Saturday night/morning. Unfortunately the show was short lived. Which did make me wonder after buying the DVD...Where is the rest of the series????Even the bonus features showed some runs with Jersey City Fire Department (FDJC) in the promo that didn't make it onto the final copy. Along with countless other departments that didn't make it to the shelf (LA City, DC and more!)Overall it was good, especially the memorial portion. Whole thing left me wanting more though.....maybe some additional volumes?"
4,YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY MAN BRO.,"Marvin's vocals are tight and his runs are smooth. If you like hard-knocking knocking funky music, you got to get it. Since Commissioned he's been givin' it up."
1,If these are anything like Maxell ear buds...,"Instead of just griping about the Maxell ear buds' deplorable sound quality, permit me to recommend a superior alternative.""Customers who viewed this"" set of Maxell ear buds would be better off listening to music/podcasts by pressing a stethoscope (check this website for availability) against the outside of any mp3 player.In a side by side comparison:Appearance - Stethoscope winsComfort - Stethoscope againDesign - same as aboveROI/value - give it to the 'scopeAudio quality - STETHOSCOPE, BY A LANDSLIDEBonus suggestion: Have your small children use these awful Maxell ear buds just for listening to music you want them to hate."
1,Weller WLC100 40W Soldering Iron,"I had one of these fot years that recently quit working so I bought another as a replacement. The replacement worked great for the first use, then it quit working on the second use. The iron would not heat.Has the quality gotten that poor in recent years? I sent it back for a refund. I'll buy a different brand for the replacement."
4,Soldering Station - Weller,"Being able to adjust the temperature of your iron with a simpe click is wonderful. Wouldn't do without it for staineld glass and other projects. This one is for my grandson doing soldering of I don't know what, but I felt you couldn't beat a Weller."
1,NO LLEGO LA MERCANCIA,"MI QUEJA ES LA SIGUIENTE NO ME LLEGO LA MERCANCIA ME CARGARON EN BSF Y EN DOLAFRES COMO HAGO PARA QUE ME DEVUELVAN EL DINERO O ME MANDEN LA MERCANCIAya pasaron casi 2 meses y medio que pàso con la mercancia, que nunca la enviaron, pero para quitarme el dinero si lo hacen rapido"
5,Awesome Bobby Vinton Collection,"This is a great collection of songs. I rate all 20 songs as good or better, with 10 very good or excellent. My favorites are ""Please Love Me Forever"" and ""Rain Rain Go Away"". There are many others that I used to like just as much, but the oldies stations play them so much I got kind of tired of them. I only wish ""My Melody Of Love"" was included, but it is not.If you like Bobby Vinton, this disc is a good choice."
5,"Owner, 25 years in trade",Nice concrete cutting saw.I use it all the time on my commercial jobsRecommend to any one dealing with concrete cutting inside.
4,Awesome movie,Only problem I have with this purchase is I like to backup my movies on my computer and for some reason I couldn't with this one...
3,solid action movie,"This isn't going to win an award or anything, but action movies don't get that kind of recognition anyway. This is what I would call a smart action movie. There is good character development, coupled with action that isn't too over the top, killing any suspensed disbelief. I like Korean movies because there is usually an undeniable syle, and they tend to be darker than most american movies. This isn't the cream of the crop for Korean films, but it is entertaining and it does have substance."
3,I was a little dissapointed but...,"Definately not what I expected. This was the last Vai CD I bought to finish my collection of him, and it is something which didn't really hit the right spot. Dont get me wrong, the man is amazing, I love all of his music. Who knows it might grow on me in time. If your a collector get it, if not, you should probably pass.I seen him live for the first time last night, 4th Feb, 2000 and he blew the whole crowd away. He is by far my favorite guitarist. But Yngwie and Eddie VH, follow right behind. If you ever see Steve live, I hope that you have the same experience that I had last night. It was like a dream."
5,Great reference tool!!!,I am fresh out of university and into the addiction field as a counselor. I purchased this book in hopes that it would increase my knowledge base as I grow into my position confidently. It turned out to be a great investment and other books I have read may have offered a more condensed version but this is an easy read. I love this book!
3,"If I hear the word ""Squeeze"" one more time!!!","Good toning workouts, with the ability to mix and match a number of workouts, from kickboxing to strength training and abs, allowing you to customize the time and content of your workout. The instructor, however, has a very high-pitched nasal voice and seems to say ""squeeze"" often in a pitch that only dogs should be able to hear."
1,MOST ANNOYING WORKOUT EVER!!!,"The ""star"" of this video has the most annoying voice I've ever heard. She croaks and squeals - it's terrible. And the workouts that are supposed to be for ""beginners"" are not - there is a lot of jumping! And if you're very overweight you won't be able to get through."
5,This game is awesome,"although it is rated mature it doesn't matter. im a 13 year old. when i was like 5 my dad had the game on the computer. i thought it was sooo cool. i liked it so much i bought the wolfenstein 2 that one is awesome too. but this game is jsut like the other one and it dosn't have too bad of viollance, it is just a little blood. it could be scary for kids littler than me because u have to go up aginst a few mean looking bosses that chase you, but other than that its not scary."
5,Never saw this one coming,GBA having the original first person shooter? WOW! But why the 'M' rating? Even in 1990 when it was made for dos it shouldn't have been 'M' even though is was the most violent game of the time. The is truely the best game for GBA so far.
5,One of the best computer games now on the GBA!,"When I first saw this game what got me hooked was that I grew up on this game in the 90's. Then as I looked down at the rating I was a little shcoked to see that it was rated ""M"". First thing that came to my mind was that it was because of the blood, but belive me there is so little blood that it is no where near being an ""M"" rated game. When I went back to the 90's I rembered that this was probably rated M for the refrences to the german nazi's. As stated before in another reveiw almost ever corner you turn there is either a swlastica or an image of Adolf Hitler. If you are not deeply offended by these images then there is nothing to worry about, since these pictures do not play a big role in the game (as there are no references to them). All in all this really is a 5-star game."
4,Wolfenstien 3D,"This has to be my favorate right next to Doom and Quake.A game that gets as realistic as fps's do.The only problems are there are no stairs or ledges,4 weapons,and levels get too maze like and are impossible to beat."
3,it grows on ya,This was my first Satch Cd and at first I didn't like it. I guess it was because he wasn't as flashy as Vai (who is still my favorite). I also think he needs to give his wah and flange pedal a rest. Now after learning to play a few songs and buying the G3 album I like it better. Much better
5,WOW,"I have been playing guitar for about 10 years now. When i heard this album for the first time my mouth hit the floor. Satch's sound, technique, and talent make him get my vote for best guitarist period. Each song on his album has a unique sound and beat that makes you listen to it over and over again. I hope satch writes another album as good as this one.....rock on"
4,Awesome is the word,"This is surely one of the ones to have if you like Joe Satriani.The last track, ""Echo"", is my favorite song of all of Joe's works I have heard.The tracks are all clean studio grade stuff - a nice reference when listening to the same songs live on Joe's other albums."
1,Cacophony!!!!,"Can I give a ZERO STAR??!!!! I cant believe the reviews and the ratings ppl have given to this album which is nothing but total cr@p, complete cacophony, and there is NO talent involved here absolutely...Anybody who knows how to strum and has access to an electric guitar can churn out noise like this. This was a terrible let down given that I had listened to Joe's ""Flying in a Blue Dream"" and ""The Extremist"" before and this was going to be my third Joe Satriani album. I listened to it and tossed it out of embarrassment!!!"
5,Man great album,"This is definitely my favorite Satch album. All the songs are good, but one of my all time favorites is Midnight. AWESOME! The first time I heard it I was just totally blown away. I had no idea what he was doing! Hill of the Skull is also good. Echo is a great rockin' tune, along with Circles. Satch Boogie is a high energy blues rock tune that gets me tappin' my foot and nodding my head each time I hear it, especially during the solos. All in all a great album. If you don't have it, BUY IT NOW!"
2,"Stretch with time, but .......","These wrist weights start out very small and stretch out with time. But eventually, the knit fabric begins to ravel, and the little weighted gravel pieces begin to fall out. Not good!"
2,Another average product from EA Sports,"I used to be a big fan of EA Sports but year after year they come up with average products. I bought most of their products from NBA live, FIFA and Madden series. EA try to improve here and there but overall it is still a big dissapointment. My suggestion to all of you football or soccer lover is to buy Japanese PS2 and play Winning Eleven from Konami. The graphic, sound and control are awesome. It is the best soccer game ever (until the next Winning eleven of course)."
1,The Worst Book I Have Read in Years,"I found this book's plot to be boring and pointless. The only reason I finished the book was due to its short length. There was no rhyme or reason for the book, there was no focus, and there was no life in the characters. Save your time and don't even bother reading this book. You probably have better things to do!"
2,Not music,"I gave this a bad review because it's a) not written or published by Gwen Stefani as Amazon claims, and b) not music. It's a CD filled with interviews and that's it. The interviews are pretty interesting but nothing you can't find at a good Gwen Stefani fan site, and nothing that is worth more than a couple bucks."
5,Great resource tool!!!!,This book was easy to read and understand. It was extremely helpful and is a keeper. I will not get rid of it.
4,Concise & Practical,"Author blends business and school success stories which confirm that affecting change in elusive. Successful practitioners recognize key elements of change and develop a flexible, coherant strategy rather than checklist of cliches."
4,"Many parts were left out including the popular ""Jack Frost"" which was televised on the original TV run -","It was nice , but many parts were edited out , I taped the original show on VHS tape. I wish they had left everything in it including the hit song Song by By Bob And Delores Hope called "" Jack Frost"""
3,Bob hope Christmas,"This DVD was enjoyable, but it was mostly later stuff. 70's,and 80's. I did enjoy it, but I am still looking for the earlier stuff."
1,PAGES WERE CUT OUT,there were MANY MANY pages CUT out of this book rendering it USELESS. I am angry & disappointed. What a complete let down. disgraceful
2,poor scholarship,Nazi Germany and its bloody social engineering are bad enough but this book and its extremly shoddy scholarship on dayly life for the average german really does honest scholorship a major disservice.A lot of good pictures though.
3,"OK, But there is much Better for GC","This game is ok for me. The graphics are really nothing special at all. Some people say the story line is pointless and the music is horrible, but all that came from the movie Driven. The game is sometimes fun. Some of the levels get very boring, but some are fun to play over and over again. For this games price, if you don't want to spend much money and want to get an acceptable racing game, this is a n okay buy, just don't expect racing like in NFS Hot Pursuit 2 or Burnout."
1,Disappointed,It fits awekwardly. I feel like I waisted my money with this product. I do cardio kick boxing and the gloves feel uncomfortable and it feels like I'm having to constantly re-adjust them and hold on to them. I have other gloves that are lighter but they are comfortable and dont feel the same way. I wish I hadn't bought these.
4,History Book,I enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and a well documented book about war on the Eastern Front.
2,Don't buy the paperback,"Ericksons Road to Stalingrad is masterly insofar as it documents in huge detail the unit to unit, army to army cross-currents from June 1941 until the battle for Stalingrad. At times when the author digresses to discuss the strategic concepts and preconceptions, he is authoritative. BUT, the paperback suffers enormously from the absence of maps....and it becomes virtually impossible to fathom who is where and how far apart different actions are. The book is written very much from the Russian point of view and there is little analysis of German methods or mentality. There are too few signposts in the text to aid the reader; eg at times the text jumps from one front or time to another with few clues that a flashback is occurring or that the action is now hundreds of miles different from previous paragraphs. Talk about the fog of war; here you can be in it and never leave your armchair."
3,I hate Kelric,"I loved Catherine Asaro's two books Diplomatic Immunity and Radiant Seas. Coincidentally, both focussed on Soz, one of the many characters in Asaro's Skolian Empire series. All the other books I've read in her series, including this one, fall flat. I think it has something to do with Asaro's inability to effectively manipulate with gender stereotypes (though she loves to do this). Additionally, her over-use of soft-porn, ""fabio-like"" lovemaking scenes leaves me turned off.I can't stand the Kelric character. There is something so unrealistic and wimpy about him. I think I would like him better if the cover art wasn't so damn cheesy. My god. I could bearly pick up the book, but thought I'd give it a try, hoping it was as good as Diplomatic Immunity and Radiant Seas. It wasn't."
3,"""Bad acting in Hollywood""","This movie had a lot of potential, but...just wasn't a home run.The story line was endearing - based loosely on real events. I have to say that as much as we hoped to enjoy this film we were surprised at the general lack of quality acting from a number of the characters.I think that my favorite characters were the guys from MN who flew to AK to try to help out. At the same time I was generally disappointed by Danson and Barrymore's efforts, and the young woman newscaster was appropriately annoying. I hesitate to be too critical, but my family and I agreed that we were happy that we waited to watch this film on DVD rather than paying to see it in a theater. And, having seen the movie, we all agreed that once was enough. That's from my wife and I and our 13 and 21 yr old daughters.The special effects used to show the whales were adequate and did not distract.All in all, 3 stars is all I can manage for this film."
5,Great story!,"Family friendly story that was recommended by a friend, and now I've recommended to other families. Well done, great characters, feel-good with a wonderful sense of reality that kids will appreciate. Our daughter is 6 and asked for it for Christmas after we rented as a family. So it arrived under the tree this year for her so we'll be able to enjoy it again and again!"
3,Big Miracle,"My eight-year-old granddaughter, my daughter and I watched this movie together. My daughter and I didn't remember this story, so it was surprising to us it was based on fact. Some of the acting was rather hokey, we did not like some of the language used as it was supposed to be a family film, but it was an interesting movie."
4,very good,it is so amazing as to what can be done beautiful Story.How everyone came together to help.Awesome. the difficulty it was and still people helped
4,1 OF ADAM SANDLERS BEST MOVIE,THE WEDDING SINGER is a great movie.Adam sandler acts normnal in this film(compared to billy madison..lol..still a great movie)until his girlfriend dumps him on his wedding day then starts to be a bum until Drew Barrymore comes into his life and he helps her arrange her mariage until Adam finds out that her boyfriend his nothing buy scum.It is one of the best romantic comedies ive seen and sits up there with eddie murphies coming to america(another great movie to look out for).Some bits will make you laugh out loud.If you are a Adam Sandler fan or Drew Barrymore fan do get this one or if you are a comedy fan that enjoys very happy endings i highly recommend this to you as this is a very funny and sweet movie!
5,An 80's retro film that actually works,Robbie is left at the altar and finds Drew Barrymore. It's love at first sight but now she is engaged! This has 80's retro all over it with reference to all things cool back in 1985 ... and has a comedic take on why it's better to be dumped than marry the wrong person.
3,Not your usual Adam Sandler movie,"By and large I do not care for Adam Sandler. I find his humor crude and obnoxious. But THE WEDDING SINGER is not your typical Adam Sandler movie. In this one, he plays a sweet, kindly guy, and brings it off quite well. I can't give this more than 3 stars, because you know where it's going before it even starts, but it does provide a fair number of chuckles along the way. There's a hilarious cameo appearance by Jon Lovitz, another by Billy Idol, and numerous funny references to mid-1980s culture. Not a great movie, but a pleasant light diversion."
5,One of those movies I can watch over and over again,"This movie is hilarious, but it also has a lot of heart. The jokes are clever, the characters are lovable, and it's just a feel-good movie. I could watch this movie every year (and I think I do)."
2,Sandler ventures too far from familiar ground.,"In this drama/romance, Adam Sandler plays a wedding singer who, as the commercials illustrate, gets left at the altar by his bride-to-be. With the exception of a few amusing lines and scenes, this movie is quite a bore. Rather than making fun of the '80s, as The Wedding Singer aspires to do, it seems like a movie from the past decade itself - not at all funny, cheesy characters and script, not to mention the annoying music and outrageous clothes. If you're used to Sandler's movies like The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, or Billy Madison, don't see this. Although Sandler has some talent in acting a serious part, this is overshadowed by the poor screenplay and just about everything else in the movie. I warn you, unless you've watched everything else in the video store, and you have roughly two hours in which you can think of absolutely nothing else to do, please refrain from seeing this."
1,Don't think just because it's Adam Sandler it's funny.,"I'll make this short...This is absolutely the lamest movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I saw this when it came out at the movies (only because the projector running ""Dark City"" was broken or something), and about 10 minutes before the end of the film, I left and got my money back. This is, by far, the worst movie Adam Sandler has ever done. It's kinda hard to actually describe how bad this movie sucks, but just trust me... IT COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY SUCKS!!"
5,One of Adam Sandlers best!,"If you are an Adam Sandler fan and you have not seen this somehow, you might as well go buy it you won't be dissapointed. A hilarious movie about an ex rock star turned wedding singer in the mid 80's. It's also one of the only movies with Drew Barrymore that didn't drive me completely nuts. Anyway its a great movie with a great cast (even Billy Idol shows up in this one) and a great soundtrack. A must see unless you absolutely hate really good really funny movies, than don't waste your time."
4,fun and cute,"this is a fun, sweet movie. I love the 80's flashback ;) Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are great together. It always surprises me how well Adam Sandler sings in this movie; i love it. I watch it fairly often, and always find certain parts funny. The first time I was watching it, i was afraid it was going to be another one of those *horrible* movies that have ""the wedding"" in the title. Besides this movie, all the movies i've ever seen with ""the wedding"" in it's title were the worst ever (take ""the wedding planner"" and ""the wedding date"", for example). Anyway, it's a great movie."
5,A great film,"This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. The story is very good. It will make you feel all of your emotions at diffrent times. It is a romantic comedy that people who hate romantic comedies can enjoy. The story is Robbie Hart (Sandler) is a great master of cermonies until he is left on his wedding day at the altar. After this things start going bad for him. His jobs are not going well because he is so depressed over the loss of his wedding that me stops caring. Then he meats Julie (Drew Barrymore) and starts to fall in love but Julie is engaged to get married. He has to find a way to get her to fall for him instead of getting married to ""a jerk-off like him"" in his own words. You will watch this movie and want to watch it again and again. On top of the acting being great the film also has great music."
1,lo peor!!! no tiene nada de divertido = \,"compré esta película por que vi demasiadas estrellas, pero me llevé tremenda sorpresa, ya que no tiene nada de divertida, la historia es pésima y las actuaciones no convencen a un pollito recién nacido.creo que me quede viendo demasiadas estrellas, pero de la ira.mi concepto: mala, mala, malísimano pierda su dinero!!! = \"
2,Not really the 80s,"I wasn't too into this movie. I didn't find Sandler as funny as he can be, the romantic aspect of it was trite, the characters weren't too realistic, and even the occasional funny reference to the fashion woe that was the eighties didn't save the film. I thought it was more cheese than anything else. However, the supporting actors that played the best friends of Sandler's and Barrymore's characters were pretty funny."
5,"Adams Best Performance, By Far!",I have watched this movie about 50 time and each time i watch it i find somthing else funny. It is very funny how he acts as the wedding singer. This is 1 of the funniest movies ever. I think everyone should buy this movie. Matt
1,Wedding Singer dissapoints greatly,"The Wedding Singer starts out as a promising period piece. Adam Sandler plays a band lead singer in the sort of band you see at weddings. The story takes place in 1985. The photography is full of bright cartoonish primary colors and the transfer is well done, noiseless and sharply focused without aliasing, but the story quickly degenerates from what should have been a sensitive comedy story of how the wedding singer and the Drew Barrymore character interact into yet another teen targeted exploitaion film with bad language, unbelievable situations, and overly sappy romantic resolutions. Could have been a lot better if the second half were rewritten. END"
1,very wack!,first of all Adam Sandler is one of the worst actors&comedians of all-time period.secondly this film is just a 80's puzzle.take something here a liitle something there.i'm surprised Puffy wasn't in it? Drew Barrymore can act a little but she comes off dinky in this film.the only thing funny about the film is the Rug on Sandler's Head.
1,An insult to comedy,"Absolutely Adam Sandler's WORST work. I laughed a total of twice through the entire movie, and that was at parts that were included in the previews. This movie was a complete waste of Adam Sandler's talent. I'd rather to have never seen this movie than have the memory of it embedded within my mind. Maybe if i watch Happy Gilmore enough I'll forget this movie ever even existed. But I can only hope..."
2,Do not see this movie!,When I first saw this movie I liked it but when I saw it a million times it gotten stupid. This happens to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Adam Sandler wasn't even funny in this movie he tries to be funny but his jokes from this movie are the same jokes from his other movies. The only scene that was funny in this movie is where that old lady was singing that rap song at a wedding party. If you want to see something funnier go rent Big Daddy. This movie wasn't funny at all it was dumb.
5,Adam Sandlers best,I fall in love with adam everytime I watch this... the songs gets stuck in my head too. Drew and Sandler is such a perfect match and when they did 50 first date its like the same chemistry was there. I recommend this movie to own.
2,I was disappointed,"I did not read the fine print, I thought this was Bishop Paul S. Morton new album it is not it is the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship Mass Choir CD, he doesn't sing until track 8 the other 18 tracks are various artists , who sound good, however that is not what I throught I purchase when I receive the CD."
2,You call this romance? Two stars for the plot.,"Lately I have been reading a lot of romance novels. When I stumbled across this one it sounded pretty good, so I decided to read it even though I hadn't read anything by this author before.I took a chance, and was disappointed. I thought the plot for this book was really good- I liked the way it was going. But the romance fell flat- rated PG, if you will. I like my romance rated PG-13 or even R sometimes- with passion! The romance scenes didn't create enough steam to cook a pea! There was no detail, it was bing-bang-boom. It left me thinging: ""What? oh, they just made love...I think?""I also thought that Valin, the leading male role, lost his tough exterior too easily.I would love to have this book rewritten by one of my favorite authors, sorry Suzanne. Pass this book by and pick up a good Quinn, Lindsey, or Roberts."
1,Not Her Best,I've spent the afternoon reading reviews of Suzanne Robinson's books at various websites; Treasure just isn't a treasure. It's getting grades of F and one out of four stars. Beware.
1,bait and switch,"I just got my 10"" legacy subs, but what i got, is NOT the same subs, that they show on the picture, what is goin on here. ill send them back. hopefully they will get it right and fix it.....!!!!"
1,CPA finds this tax package to be of little value,"I am a CPA who previously prepared 1040's, but now prepare only 1120's. I bought the 2000 version of this software simply to help me crunch numbers for my own return. I know tax law and figured Tax Cut could do the math for me.The software was infuriating. My needs weren't very exotic, but I nevertheless found the package difficult to navigate. The tax ""assistance"" offered bordered on malpractice. I ended up having to hard code some entries just to make it work.Run from this package! You'll be happier buying a pencil and doing it yourself!"
1,Former TurboTax User Regrets the Switch,This software was pathetic at best. It made assumptions about certain forms and even tried to charge me self-employment Tax on almost $5000! Good luck if you need to go back and make changes.. If you do you'll find yourself having to manually choose forms and fill them out without a walk through or any worthwhile help.I hope I don't get audited!!
2,Too soft,"I really wanted this pillow to work & I thought it would due to the positive reviews. My neck seems to hurt less in the morning when I have something to support my neck while I sleep so I thought this would be perfect. I suffer from chronic neck pain from office work at a computer all day, poor posture, etc. The pillow was extremely comfortable which surprised me. Considering the shape I was a little concerned I wouldn't be able to get comfortable. Unfortunately, once morning arrived, my neck was killing me. I think I need firmer support. This pillow was just too soft."
4,Good for those young storytellers,Bought this for my 7 yr old granddaughter who loves to write her own stories. There's places for placing photos or drawing your own pictures to go with the stories. She will love this!
4,blank books,"Great idea, although quality was a bit compromised (tear in one of the pages, several pages stuck together). I love the idea of the books, though!!"
4,Create Books,I want Lily to learn how to write and illustrate her own books. I hope this kit helps to achieve her goal.
3,Ballroom Dancing by Alex Moore,"Please be aware that this particular offering is not the 10th Edition (the newest) of this title. This is a pre-historical edition (before my time, anyway) published in 1939. Even though the changes occurred between this edition and the later ones may not seem to be that significant, I am wondering why Amazon is offering this edition to the public who are interested in ""modern"" ballroom dancing (just can not resist the pun) instead of the more ""modern"" version of it.I am giving it a three star for the obvious old feel of it."
4,Ballroom Dancing,"An excellent resource for the serious International dancer. It contains great information on body & foot mechanics. Alex Moore may not have been able to dance international, but he certainly can explain it well."
3,Improbable,The author simply relates the philosophy of the book to his background and historical link to the economic philosophy of the sub continent. The Nehru concept that the masses must rule the economy of the future. There is a strong liklihood of a lowering of the effectiveness of the capitalistic system but its not going to result in a millinnium crash.Investors must take precaution in investing during the first qtr of 2000. After that there is a bounce back of the Western world's economy. Batra's doom call is improbable.
3,Mildly disappointing,"I give Ravi Batra credit for continuing to warn us of the possibility of cyclical economic downturns. At the time this book was published, anyone familiar with history should have noticed the signs that our economy was in the midst of a speculative bubble, particularly in tech stocks. That bubble has now burst. The book's weakness may be its focus on an inflationary scenario which thus far (with the exception of gas prices) does not seem to have come to pass."
2,A time-consuming disappointment,"If you are a teacher that enjoys creating cutesy manipulatives, this book contains some really cute manipulatives. Unfortunately, their focused skills are not leveled for Kindergarten. One lace-up activity, ""the Old Woman's Shoe"", focuses on consonant blends. This resource book was a disappointment."
3,Great concept terrible writing,"The plot of this novel is original, fascinating and profound. I hope the author can sell the movie rights to this book. However, the problem is that the book was poorly written and contains numerous factual inaccuraties. I lived in upstate New York for only four years, but that was long enough to find the errors in this book. Proximity of Ithaca to Pennsylvania? Wrong!. The narrative is repetetive. The characters have no depth, and they are rather stereotypical. The gratuitous sex scene is nauseating and totally irrelevant to the plot."
3,A Pleasant Read,"An interesting, well-written story which ultimately degenerated into a tiresome tree-hugger plea worthy of Al Gore. Some of the dialogue reflects Delancey Street more than Ithaca, NY."
4,Innovative Lego Toys,I am amazed by the intelligent and innovative design which Lego designers made this Tundra Tracker. The way it looks and the way it folds up to reveal a hidden drill all make this toy a very attractive toy not just to kids and youngsters but also to adult Lego fans.
1,unable to review,Problem I had was I was looking for Blue ray DVD's and was not aware I was being offerred HD instead. Fairly sure I put Jurrasic Park on the wish list in Blue Ray. People usually do not have both players so I am still wondering how I got caught. Perhaps if you start looking at Blue Ray then HD should not be shown to you in case you make the mistake of not noticing you have been offerred something else.At this point I cannot review the product nor ever will.
3,Greatest Successful Failure,"This wonderfully crafted film looks at the Apollo 13 crisis brings a lot of energy. Jim Lovell is about to make a voyage to the moon, but his wife thinks something bad will happen. It seems it does, as the ship breaks apart, and Jim says those immortal words ""Houston, we have a problem."" The film has a brilliant cast, especially from Ed Harris, and wonderful direction by Ron Howard (who was snubbed an Oscar nomination). This is something to check out because you might learn something. Not just about space travel, but a lot of important things like a group of brave astronauts and...This is starting to drift away from becoming a film review. Anyway, this is a wonderful film that you should see."
1,No Captioning,WARNING! This video has no captioning. I've rented it and it does NOT have captioning. It is useless to me and fellow Deaf and Hard of Hearing folk.
5,Outstanding,This film is about as good as they get. It makes a great companion to The Right Stuff in any DVD collection. Tom Hanks is at his finest. Gary Sinise is wonderful and Bill Paxton plays his best character to date. Kevin Bacon is great as well. You feel like you're watching a fascinating inside look at NASA and the filming is incredible. Wonderful film on all levels.
3,Can't have it all,"I was astounded that the (US) DTS version of the DVD does not have subtitles. I love the movie, which is why I wanted to get the DTS version (NTSC, Region 1). The listing did not mention sub-titles, I should have realized what that meant. I have no use for a BlueRay or the European versions of the movie (that have both DTS and subtitles). Oh well. David."
2,Great movie ruined by BD-Live,"I have nothing more to add about the movie itself, it's one of my favorites.I have to say this is the most annoying Blu-Ray implementation I have run into. With my Sony BDP-N460 plugged in to the internet, takes forever to load and shows pointless trailers. Then it returns to the Blu-Ray player's home menu, so I can't watch the movie.Walk over, unplug the internet connection, and bingo, it plays. Universal - great way to ruin a great movie. If this is what BD-Live is all about, forget it.What you *could* have done with BD-Live is created some great interactive pages about the apollo misssions, links to NASA photos from the mission, etc...That being said, the picture is an improvement over the upscaled DVD, and the audio is worth it."
5,INTERESTING FACTS,"W. Wawrzyniak ""Woj""I am sure glad to find your letter. I could never find out why Ron Howard would do this to his greatest work ""Apollo 13."" In some way I wish he hadn't but at least this explains the difference between my VHS copy and my Widescreen DVD.I already posted a letter about another film called ""Colossus - The Forbin Project."" ""Universal"" is releasing this only in 1.33 or Full Screen version while it was film at 2.35:1Ratio. So I use ""Apollo 13"" as an example of how ""Universal"" and the rest have been cropping other movies.Your letter shows that I was wrong when it comes to Apollo 13. Yet, the majority of the 1.85 movies are nothing more than 1.33 with black bar cropping the picture. I hope someday they well stop doing this."
5,"Excellent use of the DVD format, shows what you can do.","They have created a piece of history here. The DVD not only has the movie on it, but it also includes an hour long featurette, voice overs by Ron Howard and Jim Lovell and his wife and lots of other facinating info."
1,Poor quality of sound and image,"This has to be the worst of all the DTS-DVDs. The sound has frequent distortions on all three front channels, the rear speakers are bored all day because they don't get any work, the dynamic range is ridiculous (even ""Babe"" DTS offers more) and the dialogues are difficult to understand. On top of this, the image totally lacks sharpness (although the contrast is OK). There are no special features at all, not even subtitles. Stay well clear of this DVD!"
1,Apollo 13,The DVD doesn't work. It's an HD DVD and we tried it on 3 DVD players in our house. I'm very disappointed that it is defective.
1,What a shame,"After reading some reviews (here and elsewhere), I actually decided not to buy this disk. I love the movie, but I am not going to support Universal bastardizing the BluRay format and using it to push down aggresive marketing. It's not pirates who hurt sales, it's badly made releases that insult the paying customer. If I pay for the movie, I want to be able to watch it without having to go through too much hussle and I certainly don't want social networking and other bul****. I buy movies to watch them. So thank you Universal, I'll pass (I also contacted the studio to let them know they lost a paying customer - not because of piracy but because of their own arrogance)."
2,Desperately Needs Remastering,"I am giving two stars for this edition, not the film itself, which is excellent. The video quality on the Blu-Ray was a major disappointment. There is a lot of noise or grain throughout, and is a big distraction. After watching the Sapphire edition of Braveheart, which was also released in 1995 and looks stunning on Blu-Ray, Apollo 13 desperately needs to be remastered. This would still be a decent buy if you don't already have it in your DVD collection, but it does not live up to Blu-Ray quality."
4,Down But Not Out,Apollo 13 does a good job of recreating what life was like in 60's America. The story is based on a real event and keeps viewers attention not simply on will the crew make it back home to earth but on the efforts of the hundreds of people who helped prove why there is still hope that people and life are more important than what most likely would be today's media concern for who's at fault for an equipment failure. A great film for the whole family.
4,"Very satisfied, only one thing","Love this movie and was glad to find a reasonably-priced, newly-packaged DVD. Got two - from two different sellers, but Amazon will not allow me to make two separate reviews because it's the same movie or something like that. Anyway, I got one in widescreen of the Anniversary Edition for myself and then a 2nd one for a friend. Since my friend does not care for widescreen, I did not want to get the same DVD for gift. I read the description, and while it said ""HD"", it appeared that simply meant that it would work well with HD TV's. Turned out when we received it, that it has to be in an HD DVD player only so it seems my friend cannot use it with their older DVD player. That is a bummer :("
2,"Great Movie, HORRIBLE DVD TRANSFER, JUST LIKE BTTF","If anyone has been over to the reviews for the Back to the Future trilogy boxed set, you'll see that there are many people who are dissapointed at how Universal formatted the DVD's for Widescreen. It seems that they just took the Fullscreen version and Cropped it again to make it widescreen instead of adding more of the movie to the sides.Well, I'm afraid that Apollo 13 is the same way. I compared it to my old VHS copy and there is definitely MORE of the picture included in the VHS version."
4,"Special, but really good","Be carefull, listen to samples before ! It's not like you can think. It's a blues album, a very goo d one if you listen to it often. May be the best album he made..."
4,A Different Satriani,"If you were expecting a blasting array of bi-dextral tapping, pinched harmonics and wild whammy bar hysteria, this is not the album you want to get. Satriani unleashes himself from his usual jaw dropping virtuosity and he lets the feeling of the music take over. The album is dominated by a bluesy feel, but strays occasionally into beautiful melodic tracks such as ""Home"" and the Eastern influenced ""Morroccan sunset"". Satriani's tone is once again top notch, and his inventive use of the wah wah pedal in his melodies adds flavour to the album. Perhaps this is not a Satriani album for all fans, but if you love good old blues, go and buy it. A wonderful recording."
5,"joe satriani goes bluesy a little different but great cd, also got it on time and was shipped in nice box","The cd came when it supposed to, right on time, plays perfectly, packaged perfectly. i would buy again from the dealer. The cd is a bluesier take for Joe Satriani but it's still great, Don't expect Anotehr sufrfing with the alien or Flying in a blue dream here. it's Way different but just as good."

4,Just go in expecting to laugh....a lot,The Simpsons Movie finally brings Homer and his family to the big screen. The result is one of the funniest movies I've seen all summer. It is a bit short but there's a laugh not even every minute but every second of this film. So 2 complete hours of laughing hard might've made my head explode. It also makes good points about how people just don't wanna admit that there's a Global Warming. But rather than this movie changing their viewpoints they'll just leave satisfied that they had a good laugh. Especially when Homer is probably at his funniest and strangest. There's also some humor that the show couldn't have gotten away with on tv such as the bus driver smoking a bongue...lol. The movie won't blow you away but it's fun and pretty damn funny.
4,Love the Spiderpig!,"This is a very funny movie. It's about time the Simpson's put out their own movie. The movie has the usual Simpson's violence in it and some cartoon nudity as well. Not suitable for all ages (hence the rating). But my thirteen year old loved it. He continually sings the pig on and now my three year old runs around singing it as well.""Spiderpig, Spiderpig,Does whatever a spiderpig does.Can he swing from a web?No he can't, he's a pig.Look out! He is a Spiderpig!""I would highly recommend any one who enjoys animated comedy should take the hour and a half to watch this one."
1,BORING,I have always loved the SIMPSONS but this movie fell short.Not funny very long and tiresome. I dont recommend.
4,"I love The Simpsons, but ....","I enjoyed this movie. There were great parts, and then there were a few parts where I just wanted something to happen. I liked it, but I am a huge Simpson fan."
2,"Well, hopefully there's no sequel","Horribly overrated, this film follows in the footsteps of recent seasons with lackluster writing and gags that wear out their welcome. I definitely got the feeling that this was a 45 minute show fluffed into a feature film format. The film is also Homer-centric. Bart's character is less than true to form as he goes soft as the story progresses... as a result we get few gags out of him. There is little to no interaction with the townspeople who make the show so dynamic. All in all, the story is less compelling than some of the 23 minute ones and the execution does little to help it out.Apparently, the writers realized that Simpsons fans such as myself have been waiting so long for a movie that just about anything thrown up on the screen would have sold.PS: Parking was ample."
5,Haha!! Loved It!!,"The Simpsons movie is witty,fast paced, touching, hugely entertaining and most importantly: laugh out loud funny.And if your a Simpsons fan who's loved every episode , that's all you'll need from it.However if , like me , your an obsessive fan who's noticed a drop in quality on the show from the late nineties onwards you'll see some problems. You'll see that structure wise the movie is basically an extended episode.You'll notice that the villain is a Hank Scorpio rip off. You'll feel that a lot of the plot points and character drama seem all too familiar.But in spite of all this , in spite of being a film based on a show that exhausted its best gags long ago, the Simpsons movie is still absolutely hilarious and i take my hat off to the creators for managing to make it so."
2,"Instructions not clear, for kids over 12","My son with aspergers was really excited to get this toy. He doesn't like the traditional toys. I thought this was just a simple kit with invisible ink and paper. I actually kind of wish it was.Instead it comes with 2 thick instruction books. I started reading them, and they are certainly not written for ages 8 and up. It was written for more of an age 12+. It went through the history of secret messaging from anicnet times. The book explains a few sceret mission to go on. Not one is just using invisble ink pens and paper. They are complex and require items not in the kit.An 8 year old opening who was expecting to write some messages was overwhlemed. I ended up putting away all the complex instructions and just made up our on missions."
5,WELL PUT TOGETHER COMPILATION.,This is a good compilation which features many of their classic hits.It is not perfect because it is missing a few good songs but over all it is good.If you own most of their cds then you probably shouldnt get this one.
3,not bad if this is the first time you have heard there songs,"I'm not crazy about the rerecordings of the classics ""i saw your mommy"" and ""institutionalized"" they have lost that agressive angst feel in the commercialized reissue. It would recommend listening to the orrigional recordings to really appreciate the humor and intensity of suicidal. This release is only an adequate representation of these songs,It should have been titled ""Dead Meat""."
4,"Good Sportswear (warm: middle, dry: middle)","I first saw this series sports wear in Dick's local store. The Misty Flip is rated as warm: middle, dry: middle. They use Low/Middle/High to rate the warm and dryness. More information is located at Columbia's website. The jackets are made in Asia.And, it is iterchangable, means you can change the inner jacket with the same size(they indicate the size using a color tag). But I do not think this is very useful, for it seems they do not sell the outer jacket separately.It is a good jacket. Northface may has better ones but more expensive."
1,Boo!,"This is a synopsis of the book, not the actual book. Buyer Beware! I wasted my money because I didn't read carefully, don't make the same mistake!"
3,Not for Starters,"The book is not for entry level flash addicts. The diagrams lacked alot. I would classify this book as more of a reference guide as opposed to really exploring the features of Flash.Complex graphic illustrations only added more complexity, a few more images to the explanation would have made this book easier to follow.Little time was spent in the diagramtic / animation details.Complexity is not something you going to miss out on."
5,Mickey Mantle DVD,I am very pleased with my purchase of this DVD and have added it to my Yankee DVD collection. Thanks!
5,dvd review,The Mickey Mantle dvd showed up on time for Christmas. It was well priced and is a wonderful movie.
4,Great Game,"Finding soccer games for gamecube at stores is hard. I was originally looking for FIFA 2003 or 04 but could never find it. I stumbled upon this game at a store and saw soccer on it and I purchased it.It was great. I cant compare it to anyother soccer games cuz ive never played any others, but this was really fun. I love how its challenging and is so fast paced. The controls are simple and the graphics are pretty good.There is one thing thats a bummer. I know that FIFA has all the teams: national teams, club teams, and league teams. 2002 FIFA world cup has only national teams. There are about 40 contries, all seeking to win the World Cup.This game is made by EA Sports and it carries all of their quality. This game is awesome. It is a great alternative to FIFA. It may be better."
1,Dense reading. Boring and not much use in writing a research paper.,"I had to write a research paper on the socio-economic and political results of the Protestant Reformation. I bought this book expecting some economic statistics and information. Wow, this book is worthless for such a purpose. I suppose if I were an economist and wanted some ""pleasure reading"" on the Reformation, I might get something out of it. But for the layman seeking economic information about the Reformation, this book is useless. Don't be fooled by the table of contents and first pages (""Look Inside!), there's nothing of use for the average reader or student looking for information."
4,Could have been better...,"Overall, this soccer game is worth it's price, but it falls short in two major areas.There aren't enough game modes to play in. You're either playing an exhibition game or you're playing in the World Cup. You can't create seasons or franchises like other EA titles. Therefore although it's fun, it doesn't keep you playing game after game like Madden and NHL (both EA titles) do. It therefore becomes a bit tedious when you get too good.The other major flaw is the goalkeeping. It's fairly easy to score in this game if you get into the box. The goalies just can't cover enough of the goal like they do in earlier FIFA titles for other consoles (FIFA 98 for the N 64 specifically).So although this is the best soccer game out there for the Xbox, there is still a lot to be desired."
3,THIS GAME COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD,"The quality of sports games are based on three main areas in my opinion.Graphics-This game has fairly good graphics 7 out of 10Realism-The movement of the players and the ball was excellent 9 out of 10Controls-THE CONTROLS WERE HORRIBLE! (exp. You can not change the default controls, half of the time you try to make a moderate takle you end up accidentally shooting, you try to pass to your player and the ball goes nowhere near the guy, you don't have as much control of the ball in the air as you should.) 4 out of 10I think that they rushed this game a little.-What is with the dramatic goal endings and stuff. I thought the guy was about to cry when he scored the first time.-"
2,"book for the beach tourist, not on Yucatecan sights","I bought this guide book to learn more about the Yucatan Peninsula. Apart from Chichen Itza, the book only covers Quintana Roo, and really only the beaches. The sparse chapter on the ruins only covers 3 ruins, because ""of course, most of these smaller ruins aren't of interest to the casual observer because they're mere mounds of earth ..."" How wrong the book is on this. People wax rhapsodic about UXmal, and are excited by the new discoveries at Ek Balem. I bought it at a going out of business sale, and wish I hadn't succombed to the temptation. I notice that Merida is a suggested tag -- it isn't even in the Index."
5,I dream of sexy Natassia Malthe!,"I own several DVDs that star sexy Natassia Malthe from Norway, so I wanted this one I saw at ""amazon.com"". I think she is 1/2 Chinese, and I love that. I was very excited to see her in a T-back in this DVD, so it wasn't disappointing. There are several attractive girls on it, but Natassia is by far my favorite. Her scenes in a T-back in this DVD and her nude scene in ""Bloodrayne: The Third Reich"" are ones I watch once or twice a week lately. My girlfriend now is from Japan, so I love Asian and Eurasian girls. After I watched this DVD the first time, I had sexy dreams about Natassia several nights."
2,bush people,a long slightly boring recitation of life with the bush people. there are flashes of very interesting insights about people and western civilizations impact on indigenous peoples.
5,Moreno! Great villian!,"Desmond Cory's Undertow is a bit shorter than his other work, but I didn't mind which I was surprised because I like when his work expands 200 pages -- it was still a great read nonetheless. Again we're in the old timey sleuth / international spy genre which is forever a timeless literature favorite of mine. Here we get a man named Moreno, dubbed as ""a psychopathic Spanish killer"", who escapes from imprisonment to help KGB intelligence chief Feramontov recover something called the Spyglass logbooks. The logbooks are important because they hold the key to political secrets hidden in a sunken boat.Feramontov has a problem though! He completely underestimated Moreno, as he has proven dangerous and unstable at times. Also, Feramontov has put himself on hero Johnny Fedora's radar! I love it! Moreno is slick, rough, tough and an over all bad a** villain. He kind of has a Bane-likeness to him in my mind at least (Batman franchise). Buy now!"
4,Art of Chinese Swordmanship review,"The book was recommended to me b my Tai Chi instructor. The Wu style 64 posture Jian form was being taught at the time. The book provided additional information on the sword itself, grips, postures, transitions, applications and combinations. The book is the perfect combination to reinforce what is learned."
2,With all due respect...,"Let me start with the good parts of this book:-Lineage charts in the appendix-Most of chapter 8-The form (but not very many of the applications) in chapter 6 is very clearly described-chapter 1 wasn't too bad-some of the sword vs. spear stuffWith that said, most of the book was a testament to either the deterioration of the art through generations of non-dynamic practice, or the old conspiracy theory of Chinese masters watering down the art for the westerners. Lots of ""hey let me hold my sword out and you dance around it"" applications. Lots of ""this has a questionable chance of working in a fight because it depends largely on factors beyond my control"" applications. Lots of ""let me contort myself to follow some devolved form of footwork and try to force it into situations where it may not be optimal"".I know I'm swimming against the stream here, but hopefully this information will prove helpful to some."
2,Poor audio,"This is a good CD music-wise but it wins the award for the worst audio of any CD I own and I own alot of 'em. It literally sounds like they just put a cassette deck in front of the band. But then, it is called ""Archives""."
1,Only Women,"""The Box"" had issues and promise as expressed in other reviews but I am puzzled as to one issue. Why was it always women that pressed the button? If this was a biblical reference to Eve taking the first bite it was not well thought out?"
2,A snoozer...,"I can count on one hand the times I have fallen asleep while watching a movie. This movie is one of them. The first 15 minutes are intriguing, but then the plot goes down hill very fast until it ultimately falls off a cliff and I fall asleep. I finally did manage to watch the movie in its entirety, it didn't get any better.I can't say the acting is bad, because it's not, it's the plot and the premise of the movie. The writer obviously scraped some solid ideas from many other movies and attempted to glue and rubber-band it into his own grand creation, sorry fella, it didn't work. Don't waste your time or money on this flick, the more ambitious it wants to be, the worse it gets."
1,When is Amazon going to allow a zero star rating?,"I was so looking forward to this movie, as I loved the Twilight Zone episode ""Button, Button"". Even after hearing the onslaught of negative reviews, I wanted to see it.Sadly, the reviews were dead on. The movie was awful, and I don't want to waste any more of my life talking about it."
1,Awfullllllllllll,"I remember seeing the previews of this movie and thinking it looked interesting..just watched the movie...absolutely AWFUL..i love movies and will watch most anything..i wasted 2 hours of my life...the only thing that kept me watching was cameron diaz..figured if she was in it, must end up decent (if it was an unknown, would've turned it off after 20 minutes)...DONT WATCH..nothing good about this..confusing boring...."
1,deserves ZERO stars...,biggest crap I have seen in a long long timereligious simple-minded dumb B.S.I can only hope that they will never again make a cent of this ....
1,Horrendously bad!,"This was a pointless movie, unless the sole intent was to piss me off, waste my time, and ruin a halfway decent premise.Throughout the viewing, I felt like The Box could have righted itself and turned this pile of cinematic excrement around in order to salvage part of the story... but no. Aside from a couple eerie moments and some fine acting, I can't think of any redeeming features.If you love weird, off-beat thrillers with a psychological and/or philosophical punch, then watch something else. This God awful sorry excuse for a film is not worth your attention.Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
2,disappointment,"I am a big Cameron Diaz fan, but this was really a disappointment. It was slow and hard to follow, I kept waiting for something bid to happen and that never happened. It was a very ""dark"" movie. The review looked good and I couldn't wait to watch it, I am glad I didn't go to the show to see it."
3,He is good! But others? They are excellent!!!!!!,"He is one of the well_voiced Turkish popstars, but if you looking for a real taste of Turkish music, I must advise you to listen Sezen Aksu, Sertap Erener(she also made a duet with Ricky Martin),Grup Gundogarken,Yldz brahimova...And also an unforgettable sound Zeki Muren!"
4,"A nice children's picture book, NOT by Papini.","This is a nice, large print CHILDREN'S picture book, about the life of Christ, with no single author credited. It is a British edition, in no way connected to anything Giovanni Papini wrote. Papini's is a 450 page novelized biography of Christ, with no illustrations, decidedly for an adult audience, translated into English from Italian in 1923. The above title, as nice as it is, is listed incorrectly, and has nothing to do with Papini or his novel, and should be listed as a children's book."
3,disappointed,"I thought this documentary was going to be a lil more indepth than what the news was and in my opinion it really wasn't. I thought I would be learning much that was not covered by the orginal news and I really didn't. I bought it for my homeschooler I that didn't work either it was way too ""boring"" for kids and teens. I would really appreciate someone making a documentary on this event that would catch the interests all kids, teens and adults. Especially since this day marked a very tramatic day in history for all humanity. Sorry I hate not being able to give good reviews but...the truth must be told! this dvd would be great for some people but for most...even if the topic/event is very important to all not many could sit through this whole documentary."
5,It really gives you hope,"I love this dvd. As an ""IC sufferer"" myself I highly recommend it. I tried all medical options I could get in this country and nothing really worked or helped, so I had to turn to holistic medicine. Catherine's books were first to show me the way and her dvd is more like a nice ""conclusion"". 4 years after the beginning of this hell I am so much better but I had to turn to alternative medicine and I don't regret it at all. Thanks, Cat for this dvd, it really makes big difference in ""ICers"" life."
3,Get it for the following track: The Boss,"For years I have been looking for the MAW remix of the Braxton's remake of Diana Ross' ""The Boss"" because it really is one of the best dance remixes I've heard - I think it came out in late 97' but the fact it was inlcuded in the House Compilation ""Soulfuric In The House"" is proof that people still love it. The violins are HOT! The sweet vocals on the track are sexy, and I recall the remix being played at only the best and most underground of dance clubs . . . If you can track down the maxi-single of ""The Boss"" you will not regret it. I've been trying to get it for years. The Braxtons, in my opinion, by choosing to cover this song and having MAW handle it, achieved a relevance and edge that their older sister Toni can be proud of --- and maybe a little envious of --- the fact that people are still talking about the remix YEARS later . . . ."
4,Girls On The Side!,"I purchased this CD through BMG Music Service and I can't stop listening to it! My favorite song is ""So Many Ways"". Thses girls should defianatelly someday come back together(and even include Toni!). Toni Braaxton has defianatelly made it big in this buisness... but unfortuantelly ""The Braxtons"" and the lead singer ""Tamar Braxton"" just haven't made it that big. Tamar Braxton released her solo debut album ""Tamar"" in 2000 and just like her and her sisters Trina and Towanda and herself included in the group... they just didn't have enough reconiition to make it big."
2,you really get what you pay for,"i ordered this camera because i needed a cheap one. it was sent to me extremely fast, no issues and the camera looks very nice on the outside.the only problem, i can barely see myself in it. i even twisted the thing to try and focus it, but i could barely see myself. its very blurry, very grainy, and it doesn't highlight any of my good features. i'd never ever let someone see me on a webcam like this. i had to put a lamp right next to my laptop to even see myself fine. i've ordered a different camera now and i'll see how that one goes.just, you get what you pay for. if you don't care what you look like, then get this cam."
2,okay,the cam was defective so i returned back to Amazon..but i m willing to buy a good one and i will see to it..thanx for everything
5,Everyone who sees it loves it!,When we were re-decorating our cozy little retirement home I decided to decorate the front bedroom as mine & chose a feminine color & decor & my husband got the master bedroom. His bedroom became a Golfing Room. We found many golf items at great prices & even used some of my retirement gift certificates at local stores for these great items. But the best buy of all came from Amazon. It was his golfing wall clock. It matches his color sceme of light green & depicts some old fashioned golfers in knickers. I could not believe the price for a Seiko!! What a great deal. Everyone who sees his room comments on the chosen theme (of course I am talking about his golf buddies) and their wives never fail to comment on this clock! My lips are sealed about the great price however. I tell them to look it up on Amazon.
2,OK in Parts,"But Reisman really is out to lunch when it comes to his arguments regarding environmentalism. He dismisses the notion that nature has an ""intrinsic value"" but rather views nature as pure utility to man, including the extermination of species that are not friendly to man. This totally disregards the complexity of nature and its evolution over billions of years. He doesn't seem to be aware that it might not be such a good idea to shock this slow evolution.Reisman doesn't give much thought to the essence of risk and the huge impact of rare events within complex systems like world economics (or nature obviously). His theories are based around ""equilibrium"" and relatively small variations around an equilibrium point."
2,charming but misguided,"When one looks beyond the obvious charm of nostalgia to the parents, and the appeal of a cowboy, horses, and a ranch to their children - you see major problems. The sentences are stilted and insulting to even begining readers. A bigger problem is the example of how to deal with wildlife: Cowboy Sam shoots at a wolf and later shoots and kills two rattle snakes. This was the casual attitude of the times, ""See Snakes - Kill 'Em"". hopefully we know better now so this is something to be discussed with a child reading the book that snakes play a part in keeping down rodents and there are other options than complete extermination."
4,I LOVE COFFEE,I bought this set and they look great! They are 8x10 and require you to get a frame for them. But they really complete my coffee theme decore. Thanks Guys!
3,Christmas show Not as good as expected,We used to watch the Sonny and Chair show regularly and this was good but not as good as expected.
4,Thompson treats the details of sampling theory best,"In the last 5 years or so, as a practioner, I have examined and used, or tried to use, 5 or 6 current texts on modern Sampling theory and practice. Steve Thompson's has been the most consistently useful. He offers more than the conventional wisdom, more than the standard technique. He describes alternative and special methods. when they are best used and how, complete with pros and cons. His generally clear explanations go beyond the usual mathematical formalism to the practical aspects.For applied folks such as myself, this is really critical. You do not need to be a professional mathematician to make good use of this volume.In particular, I have made good use of the Thompson's approach to double sampling technique in my own work sampling from the Net, a field loaded with methodological pitfalls.If you are seriously concerned with generating valid samples in practical applications, Thompson will become a trusted friend."
4,The best one yet,"I really enjoyed season 4 of the def poetry jam series. It has gotten better and the poets have improved as well. Special guest are selected for each episode and it is longer then the previous seasons. I only wish it offer some type of bonus material, like interviews, music videos, or backstage poet rants. Other then that it is packed with passion, humor, power, love, faith, and truth. KRS ONE and Doug E Fresh rocked it!!!"
5,Love it!,"My husband and I just love this CD. We've played it for all our friends and now I think they all own copies. We went out the other night to a pub and heard one of the songs being played, it was great to sing along to. I would highly recommend it!!"
3,Important Read,But nothing spectacular. Interesting insight into a more anarchist strain of communism (council communism).
4,Atypically concise,"Among the influx of hipster rock bands flooding the marketplace, The Dears breakout NCL rose above a typical brooding angularity to offer this modestly diverse set of elegant indie."
2,"Sappy, pretentious and soft.","I was suckered in by the buzz from friends. I buy lots of records and can afford to chance getting burned once in a while.This is farty and overblown. The best moment is a Morrisey derivative that is not half bad. I wanted this to be successful since I live in Vermont and Montreal is about as local as it gets outside Burlington. But wishes don't make it so! This really sucks if you like your music hard, edgy, idiosyncratic, wierd or just plain balls-out rock'n' roll (Of recent stuff, I like the new Lou Reed, Mos Def and Le Tigre, to give you an idea of where I am coming from). I imagine there are some old time sorority types who listen to this seriously. After ten tries, I have still not gotten through the whole record at one time (It's that bad). Don't be disappointed; have a friend dub you a copy. Better still, take mine!"
1,don't believe...you know what,"come on, nobody needs this. this man is painfully IMITATING morrissey. the songs don't help either. i'm tired of ""interesting""-looking female keyboardplayers staring at camera in boring rehearsal-videoclips. look at your HANDS, you can't even play.. one star goes out to a song title: you guys actually ARE ""lost in the plot""."
5,Stand Out,"This, like Taja's previous two albums stand out from the rest of the same old stuff female artists. The lyrics are highly original and thought provoking. Taja's voice as always is amazing"
3,"PLEASE DON'T, HAVE MERCY ON OUR SOULS","HELP ME! PLEASE! These are the only words you'll be able to utter after watching this horrible(no, horrible isn't even a good word to describe this movie), When they come up with a word to describe this movie I'll let you know. What's with that Torgo guy,What's with the girls laying around on concrete slabs with white night gowns on,What's with the plot(better yet,Where IS the plot). If this guy Manos is so powerful in the black arts, why does he live in a run down 1 room shack in the middle of the dessert. I can't think of any movie I could ever watch that would be more horrible than this one, except this movie without Joel and the Bots.I have seen the devil and he is the director of this movie."
5,"The worst movie, but the best episode.","This is the cheapest, cheesiest movie ever put to film, but it's also the best MST 3K episode. This is the one I was always going back to for repeated viewings. Even the Mads apologize! I've never seen that happen before, so this must have been bad. However, the comments make up for it. I like it when Joel & the bots imitate Torgo, the haunting(and funny) Torgo theme, the idiot 'Master' with the hands(get it?) on his robe, the very bad choppy editing, etc... I wonder if this one is available by itself? If so, who would want it? Oh, and the return of Torgo (played by Mike) as a pizza delivery guy, was funny as well."
5,A funny take on a classic...ly bad movie,"When I mentioned that I had seen the worst movie ever, they thought ""Mother"" or ""Best in Show."" Ha.Nothing went right in this movie. The cuts are awful. The acting is arguably worse. The writing cannot even be called ""writing!"" Torgo, a satyr, never actually reveals his knees, instead you just think his knees are extremely swollen. The teenagers in the car serve no purpose. The cat-fight was pretty cool, though.The MST3K gang, however, shed some light on the movie that makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look watchable, and not for camp value.Definetly worth the ... I spent on it, I recommend you do the same."
2,Hands of Boredom,"I am normally a die hard fan of MST3K, but this is their best work. I bought this video because I heard it was funny and it was a waste of money. My friends and I coundn't stay awake durring the film. We tried many times to whatch it but it never improved. If you are looking for a good MST3K movie whatch The Angels Revenge or The Pod People, don't waste your time on this movie."
2,Technical glitches - beware,"In spite of having the hillarious Poopie Vol.1 reel on it, around track 16 (the layer change I assume), the playback stops. Not pauses - stops. Of course you can cue up track 17 and back up to the errant position and continue watching but obviously, Rhino (or SOMEONE) has really fouled up this edition.Also released at the same time of ""Manos"" my (purchased at the same time) copy of Mitchell seems to be ""warped"" for lack of a better word. Either that or it's taken a new record for putting out dull off-center throbbing sounds from BOTH of my DVD players. This is pretty bad considering how cheap and simple it is to press DVDs these days. Either Rhino has let quality control go to the dogs, or this is a bad omen for future releases. Buyer beware - or keep that receipt in your quest to find a working copy"
4,Good fun history,"My boys and I enjoyed this book. Literary critics will slam it for variosu reasons including the fact that it follows a fairly clear pattern. But ti works well as a fun, adventurous story that along the way encourages character and teaches about this period of history. We commend this book."
1,ok,"I love this DVD player! The picture and color are great, but I did not enjoy it for long. It worked for about a week. I had a lot of trouble when I first received it with the battery. The battery pack would not hold a charge. I wasn't happy with the customer service at Amazon. The thirty day warranty starts when you place the order. I did not receive it for 2 weeks so when I realized the battery wasn't holding a charge....Amazon would NOT help me. I really wanted the dvd player for a LONG road trip with the kids...it just did not work out!"
3,'refurbished' player,Went for this one because of good reviews and larger screen. Have only used a half dozen times- but it does seem to make a lot of noise as it sets up to play a DVD. Lots of clanging and squeeking that makes me think it will stop playing at any moment. One DVD would not play at all- but played fine on my iMac computer later. This was a refurbished player.
1,Battery Issues,"I have had this DVD player for about 13 months and have had no issues until the battery completely stopped charging. The moment I pull out the power cord, the DVD player completely stops. This pretty much ruins the purpose of having a portable DVD player. I called Toshiba and was told tht I would have to pay for an repairs. This battery issue seems to be a common problem with this player. If you get one without this issue, it's a pretty good player."
2,Only Lasted 12 months,"Just so you know, this thing only lasted 12 months before the rechargable battery stopped recharging. The unit still works if plugged into an electric outlet or car adapter, but the battery won't hold a charge. If you are looking for quality, look elsewhere - it seems like several other reviewers have had problems with this unit."
5,The Name Fits,"Seamless integration with Contact Managers like Card Scan. The ""KOFAX"" technology rocks. I use with Paperport. My last Visioneer, XP100, survived 8 years and 1 million air miles. Accounts payable wants a receipt; any receipt, and it's on its way to corporate in less than 5 minutes."
4,Great Portable Scanner,"The Visioneer Road Warrior scanner is easy to set up and use. It also fits easily into my laptop bag. It works great for paper and receipts... only acceptable for photographs. I had hoped to use it to scan some family photos while traveling, but it was only partly successful in this area and began scanning with streaks pretty quickly. The cleaner and alignment papers did not resolve the problem. Despite this, I'm happy with the purchase. You just have to recognize the limits of the device."
5,In the Psycho Realm,"Muggs... this is like a soundtrack to a classic movie. the beats are deep dark and could stand on their own, as an instrumental. together with B-Real, Duke, & Jacken, this album is one of hip-hops un-harvested gems. this album is unbelievable. it's too bad that some good music never eceives the credit it is due. if you buy any hip hop album , this is it. if yoru dissappointed by this album, then you really don't know what good music is, and you should give this album to someone who can appreciate it for the masterpiece it is."
1,dookie,"this album was poo poo...i put this cd into my car and hit play...it starts off pretty good with a catchy beat but than the rapping started. i couldn't beleive how bad these guys were at rapping, i mean b-real is tight...we all know that, but these guys he recruited were straight garbage. they rap off beat and they try too hard to make it sound grimey, and it comes off just sounding bad. production wasn't all that great either, alot of the beats sounded similar, and the bass didn't knock as hard as i would 've liked. all in all , i would wipe my a$$ with this album."
2,The Psycho Realm,"The Psycho Realm sounds like a cross between Cypress Hill and the Gravediggaz. At first many of the eerie beats are catchy, but too many of the songs sound similar and soon the novelty gets old. Not a bad debut, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone unless they are a huge fan of B Real and the Hill."
4,Spiritual Awakening,"This CD, Shout in the House, is great by Moto City Mass Choir. I find it inspirational and touching and it puts me in the frame of mind to worship God. I love it. Great product. To bad they have discontinued selling it. I guess because it is an old CD. They should bring it back."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A novelisation of the entertaining and advanced for its time tv mini-series.Aliens come to Earth and offer what seems like a good deal, in turn for what seems like not a lot.All is not as it seems, and there is one hell of a lot of snakes in the grass, as the hungry aliens take over.A resistance forms to combat them."
3,Decent book,"I had to read this book for a Bible college class. I found it okay and relatively interesting, although I can't say I gleaned a lot of new information/knowledge. It is an easy read and written for men (I am a woman). Written by a man who is now living in freedom from a sexual addiction, there were some good insights, although nothing profound (I thought). The scripture he used was very good, although I thought he used some verses repetitively. He said a few times that he had a 5 step process/plan for gaining freedom from an addiction, but he never clarified them in the book, leaving the reading wondering what they were or which helpful things he listed were they. I really appreciated chapters 12 and 15, in which Gallagher acknowledged that it is a spiritual battle and there are spiritual forces which we battle against. Not every Western/American Christian counselor will acknowledge that, even though it is scriptural and real. Overall, decent book."
4,My 8 year old can operate it,"It just takes practice to use this press. Press it a couple of times in different spots on your cookie sheet until the perfect cookie pops out. My eight year old was using it this evening to make christmas tree cookies and they turned out perfectly. By the way, we did not use the pampered chef recipe for spritz cookies...in my experience any recipe will do. Make sure you chill your dough though. I have owned my press for almost 20 years and it still works fine."
3,It hard to clean inside,Its my first time using a press. I wish they were all large disk found out had to put it right to tray to get them to come out. I like it a lot I am glad i got it.
4,Non-Stop Riff-Attack Mayhem,"You really get your money's worth with this laugh a minute riff-a-thon. Even better is the added bonus of saying goodbye to Joel and hello Mike!Now I understand why this episode is so revered, not a moment is wasted tearing this film to comic shreds and with so much energy it really adds to the enjoyment level. The best moment has to be when Mitchell gets into a shouting match with a 10 year old that is so ridiculous it didn't even need the S.O.L. Crew's commentary to get a laugh.A truly enjoyable episode, but the most joy came from seeing Joel get rocketed off into space and the promise of Mike taking over as host."
5,Joe Don Baker is Mittens!,"This is a can't-miss episode of MST3K! It's Joel's last episode, and he goes out with a bang with very funny riffs that will have you rolling on the floor! Many riffs deserved to be a favorite but only one can.Honorable mentions are:Joel: Mitchell! Tom Servo: Heart poundin'! Joel: Mitchell! Crow: Veins clogin'!Crow (in Andy Caufman voice): Thank you very much.All: My, My, My, My Goooooooooood!But my favorite is this one.Favorite riff-Joel: Mitchell, even his name says ""Is that a beer?"""
3,"Love Mitchell, Wish the DVD Could Be Better","Just bought one of my favorite MST3K episodes and it's as funny as I remember it but I wish Rino would make a better DVD for it. When I bought Eegah, that was a much better quailty disc then this one. Mitchell is a classic amoung all the MST3K's. I think it is one of the best movies that they ever made fun of. For one thing it's about a fat, lazy, unhygenic cop and it has one of the sickest sex scenes ever filmed. I also loved that car chase with the turn signals going off and hot merging action. I that this is a must have."
5,"PORTRAITS OF TERROR, PORTRAITS OF LOVE","The remarkable portraits in this book - the author's two young sons, his mother, his sister, their surviving relatives in Europe - and the landscape of their journeys across time create a depth of field in which Mr. Rose himself emerges as a man of exceptional tenderness and civility. The horrors of the Holocaust are numbingly familiar, but what's new here is love, a father's fearless self-discovery, for his children's sake, out of the terrors their family endured. An extraordinary achievement, very deeply moving."
2,do not meet expectations,"At this momment of e-commerce, a reader may expect more specific details about the feasibility of an Internet business. Good value of a business plan requires more details, hints, tools cost and return estimations."
1,"Item is no longer available, but AmericanRX still hasn't removed it from their pages.","Even though this product has been off the market for quite some time, AmericanRx still has not removed it from their pages.They substituted another Alka Seltzer product without notification and then I had to incur the expense of returning the product to them. They did pay the original shipping costs."
1,"poor controls, too much trouble to use","It's adorable and I think it sounds okay when it works.I have 3G Nano 8 and have to reset my ipod to use it and be sure it's fully charged. The unit doesn't come with the ac adapter, but they'll sell it direct to you for 21.99 (no s&h;) tho. I am disappointed. I am going to try it with the adapter and report back.Buy with caution."
1,Simply awful,"This seemed an interesting speaker system for on the go. I agree that the control buttons are temperamental however the sound completely sucks. There is NO BASS to speak of and it sounds like an old transistor radio and not a good one at that. This baby is going back first thing in the morning. If you buy it, I urge you to save the receipt as this is a for sure round trip ticket item."
1,Horrible!,"I never thought I would write a review about bannana jacks but these are extremely poor quality. First, on two of the jacks the hex set screw stripped. Not good. Then a third hex screw after being screwed down securely just stripped and popped out. I ended up soldering all four wires in. Second, the vinyl sleeve is very cheesy. It slides up and down the jack when you insert them and it's quite difficult to grab them with enough pressure to insert them into the female end.I have never seen bannana jacks built like this and I hope I never do again. A big waste of money since there are better quality jacks out there for the same price."
3,Belkin PureAV Gold Bannana Plugs (4 pack),"These banana plugs are functional with one flaw. The rubber gripping portion slided up on the bananna and can result in the prong not fully seating in the hole. Belkin should change the design to where the inside is wedged to not allow it to slide forward paste the face of the plug. These do the job and the screw in the metal base to accomodate a good tight grip on the speaker wire is sound, if not a little more work. Tighter than some other plugs that screw down on the wire after it is positioned out of a hole. The gold coating on the bannana is a good sound fit, so for a home application it is OK."
2,Hard to connect wires to,"These plugs hold their wires with a screw than tightens down over them. It's difficult to get stranded wire well seated that way, and the wires pull loose very easily. Worse, you need to use the tiny allen wrench provided to loosen and tighten the screw. It's flimsy, hard to fit into the slot, and extremely easy to lose."
2,banana plug,"You get what you pay for. These were cheap and they are cheap, very difficult to plug in and remove without dislodging the plastic cover, it always comes off."
4,"Kick Ass Book, entertaining and Historical","this book is great. i honestly burst out laughing a few times from teh ridiculous stuff the CIA did in the 50s and 60s. its a good book that has lots of really cool facts and not only does it have facts, its got the sources so you can look up the real documents that all the facts came from.only down side is that at times it gets a little borring, but all you have to do is skipa page and you are back to the crazy CIA stories... i give it a B+"
1,no delivery,Never received the book! So now I am just using up my 16 words so you get this. hopefully soon
3,Review of Secret of the Ages,"An excellent, ground breaking book when it was first published but it is much surpassed by current publications such as ""Law of Attraction"" and ""Ask and It is Given"" by Ester Hicks and ""The Greatest Secret"" (internet Book) by Darell Daybre.Bob S"
5,FANTASTIC,"I just received this one in the mail, I couldn't wait to hear it. This Snooky like the rest of his stuff is excellent, a very nice recording also. He wrote most of the songs on this too, that is something I always loved about Snooky. This makes his songs more personal, and his vocals are always so strong. His harp playing is always great to hear, plus he always has a great backing guitarist with him. His song writing skills never weaken, and this is a nice long player. All his music is well worth hearing, so these are good ones to pick up while they're still in print. Because like this cd some of them are already out of print, so the price will start to climb which makes it a good time to buy."
2,thespian charm,Not what I thought. Doesn't look like anything when received. Difficult attaching the charm to a necklace. Recipient was not thrilled with it.
3,not worth the retail price,"I was somewhat disappointed in these sheets. There's nothing wrong with them per se; they just feel like all of the other $30 sheets I've ever bought. These are nice sheets for the price I paid, but I think that the retail price of $175 is misleading. After they arrived, I found out that these are Amazon's ""house brand"" sheets at their everyday price instead of more expensive sheets on sale."
5,Wife Loves 'Em,"This is the third set of sheets we have purchased from Amazon and, according to my wife, the best. She describes them as so comfortable that they approach ""buttery"". They also wash up nicely. We are very pleased with the purchase and the fact that we were able to get them from Amazon at a deep discount."
5,I don't want to get out of bed!,"I bought 3 king sets when these were on sale, and my only regret is that I didn't buy more. Even at regular price, these are worth the money. They are so smooth and silky soft - and I am super picky about sheets. I absolutely WILL NOT sleep on any sheet that has ANY pilling or roughness going on. My skin is too sensitive. The pockets are deep, and the sheet stays on the bed. They also launder well. I do wish there were darker shades though. These pastels are nice, but I prefer deeper shades. That won't stop me from buying more though - I can't see the color when I am blishfully asleep!"
5,"Soft, light weight, big bottom sheet","These sheets are great, the price is great and i had a great night's sleep on them. I also bought the 300 thread count duvet cover in the sky blue and my bed is like sleeping in a cloud. It's sooo comfy. The bottom sheet covers my oversized mattress and the 4 inches of memory foam with no problem, of course, as in most sheet sets the top sheet is not comprably sized, but it's still not as small as some I've gotten. I recommend these sheets without reservation."
3,"Fitted sheet does not fit 18"" mattress","I bought this sheet set because our mattress set is 18"" and it's hard to find sets that fit. The fitted sheet does not cover our mattress completely and pops off the corners and creeps up. The quality is good, just don't try it on an 18"" mattress as stated. It would probably work on a 16""."
2,I hope the next one will be better...,"Well... I'm a little disappointed about this DVD.First - I'm a real BIG fan of The Cure;Second - The first VHS (staring at the sea, the images - 1986) is better than that DVD, because has more information about The Cure, but I know it's just a VHS!!! I thought it would have some interviews... some fun as ""The Cure Play Out"" (VHS)has...Third - They said ""THE DVD ALSO CONTAINS A FEW 'HIDDEN EXTRAS'""that I couldn't find...Fourth - If you pay attention in the end of ""A Forest"", they just took the VHS video, cut, and put inside of the DVD....(You can hear a applause noise)...:(Fifth - The accustic session is really strange!!! Just like they aren't playing...(serious people, they really weren't doing that for fun!!)Last comment - I just gave 2 stars because of two new videos clips, specially ""Just say yes""!!!"
2,This CD does not reflect the real Cure.,"Hi,I am a long time Cure fan since Pornography came out. I must admit I am a musician that plays dark rock. I understood why Robert Smith needed a break from the Gothic style but this record only reflects the most upbeat shallow and less interesting of all the songs they wrote. Love Song and Inbetween Days are the only ones that ever got air play on this CD in LA, where I was living playing with my band. I was so dissapointed when I bought this CD. I hope they make another one that includes songs from Pornography, The Top, Faith and the dark music that made their name. I do not believe Smith is a sell out, he just decided to move in different musical directions and in my opinion they all just did not work. If you like the shallow dance songs of The Cure this is for you, if not buy one of the earlier CD's in particular The Top, is tops in my opinion.ThanksAndrea Moore of Twist of Fate"
4,still bringing it Live,I've seen Lionel Richie in Concert&the Cat is always on top of His game.He knows how to bring it live.all the Classic Jams are here&Lionel is knocking it out of the Box.but the New stuff brings it down for me.now if Lionel can re-group with the Commodores&Bring the Funk into the New Era then things will truly come full circle.this is a Real Good Live Set from one of the Greatest Songwriters Ever.
3,Buying filters online,"I think the price point is pretty decent as I have several furnaces and replace twice a year, but was a little disappointed that the box came crushed on one side and so had to massage the filter somewhat back into shape to get into filter slot in furnace. I don't think the quality or effectiveness was compromised. So evaluation of ""okay."""
1,actual size not well noted,The main size indicated on the title of the item is not the actual size so it did not fit into the filter cabinet.
2,"Good, but needs to be leather bound","This Bible is good for notes in the side columns, but would probably be better if there were lines out to the side instead of the current wide open format. This would also be better with a scripture reference column and actually more room to take notes. I was disappointed with the cover bending so easily. This would be better in a genuine leather cover."
2,Ok for the price,Decent vlue while it works. The right side has now died. I'll replace in time for football season. Spend a bit more and get a good system.
3,BEAUTIFUL STONE,"I loved this ring, but had to send it back. The stone sat too high for my liking. It's definitely not an everyday ring. I wished Amazon or the vendor had provided a side view of the ring, plus the dimensions. That would have helped in deciding to buy the ring in the first place. It would have saved me money and the hassle of returning it. It has a beautiful setting and the stone itself was clear with a beautiful cut, which brought out the color of the smokey quartz."
5,Great Movie,Extremely entertaining. Well written and exciting. Safe House is an action packed movie with a creative story line. Fresh movie.
1,Fell asleep...lol!,Cannot fairly rate this movie...I fell asleep and didn't catch it the next day. Wish I had seen it though.
2,This is one of those movie's that may be worth watching once....,"Watching once, but then knowing in advance how it ends, is not worth waiting for, again.Why anyone was entertained by this film enough to say that they'd watch it again, must mean that either you don't have a lot of other movies to watch, or you just wanna look cool, having a new currently released movie. (""Hey, look what I got!"")This Blu-ray (or DVD) is likely to be selling for about $4.99 within the next year or so.Yes, I know this isn't really a review of the movie. It's more about my experience of watching it. I would not bother to watch this semi-yawner again."
1,poor Amazon video quality,I watch movies on a high quality plasma. Something about Amazon videos makes them very dark. I don't have this issue with Netflix. On the computer monitor there is no issue. Watching on plasma should be a suprior experience but ends up being the opposite. It's almost unwatchable. Amazon - please fix it.
3,It was not what i expected?,I was expecting to see better chemistry with Ryan Reyonlds and Denzel Washington but there was none. Denzel had much more charisma and charm in Training Day.
3,Same Film different title,"This is the same stock picture as any modern spy film . . . CIA bad, burned spy wanting to blow a whistle on everything, the young impressionable agent caught in the mix. What makes this movie entertaining is the setting of South Africa, which is a unique location, and the acting is better than most spy films. It's worth a rental, but it certainly isn't anything original or mind-blowing. The ending is so commonplace, I figured it out half-way through. I've seen this movie before, under a different title and with different actors. I wish they'd give us an original spy film. But overall, it's a fun film that was beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. It even adds little bit of South African soccer to it."
2,No commentary makes this a rental not a purchase,"What??? No director's commentary or audio commentary of any kind? That makes this a rental not a purchase. C'mon, Universal!"
1,Safe house,Didn't get to finishing watching this movie because it kept freezing up every twenty minutes! It's a good movie went to see it in theaters but horrible horrible on amazon
2,Denzel needs to get out of his role-rutt,"I'm ready to see Denzel in a role where he's not playing a badass. Love ya Denz, but you need to mix it up some."
4,"Good movie, but...","It seems like i've seen this before. I guess a lot of what was going to happen, my wife was baffled. haha. But as always the acting is awesome. These two could pull off any role, perfectly. I bought this on n***er tuesday, and the ultraviolet code already expired. Stoopid. Why have an expiration date in the first place? its not that old of a movie. Thats the main reason i took off a star."
4,Denzel,"I never purchased this movie, but I did rent it. Denzel makes this movie worth watching, and that's the case in every movie he ever appeared in. Denzel's character is what held my attention which I suppose is as it should be since he's the star. It would have been just another car chase and shoot-em-up without him."
3,Safehouse Review,"Acting ,photography and locations were stunning. The plot line was thin and seemed contrived at times. I would not watch it again but it was worth watching."
4,Now this is a Denzel Movie...,"Yes, I really liked this movie and I am glad I got it. I have nothing negative to say about it and this is saying alot. Another great addition to the my husband's Denzel Washington collection. Great story, great scenes and amazing actors, you'll love it."
3,Great movie,Great movie fast paced and great twists and turns the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat although it was a little predictable at times it's still a great movie.
3,Denzel has done better,I like Denzel Washington but not in the role as he had in Safe House. I do not really care for a movie like this but when it has Denzel in it I have to watch. The movie was alright but I have seen better.
2,feedback for safehouse,"item recieved in timely manner.for some reasson it would not play on two dvd players.it did however work on my portable dvd playergood movie, lots of action"
3,Little disappointing,"We found this to be a little disappointing. Love Denzil's movies, but this one didn't seem to hold our interest."
5,excellent movie,"This is a good movie worth the cost to rent. Some of the twists were obvious, others were very surprising"
4,Enjoyable but forgettable,"Great acting and enjoyable action sequences without going over the top with the violence. However, there at times that it seems to drag between the excitement. No special surprises by time you get to the end of the movie as you feel like it gets to exactly where it was playing up to the entire time. Still, an enjoyable rent but not 5 star worthy."
3,too violent for me,"While I was expecting the usual fighting, shooting and chasing in any thriller movie. This one was more than I usually like to see. More like Kill Bill, than any Bourne movie. If you're OK with that kind of thing, the acting was good and the plot interesting. If not, skip this one."
3,flea comb,doesn't work on dogs with hair longer than an inch. comb. looks well made. I have a sheltie an it just doesn't. work. for my anna
4,Good Choice,"I am relatively new to the world of home exercise, with the exception of a few TaeBo videos. I bought this DVD because my thighs have always been a major problem area, and after doing the video twice am very impressed. The exercises are explained well and very easy to do- its the repetitions that kick my butt! The models are a little lifeless, but their physique is definite motivation. Overall, this DVD was worth my money."
4,Harmonizing Four: Where He Leads Me,"My father loves the Harmonizing Four and knew them years ago. They were his favorite group to invite to programs at the church because they're sound is perfect and timeless. Not only that, but they could also draw a large crowd."
3,Is there life outside the U.S.A.?,"The idea behind this book is very nice, and the authors are quite successful at making great deal of fun, at the expense of the learned (or sometimes not so learned) experts, who should have known better. Unfortunately for an international reader, the vast majority of the events and personae selected for the book deals with the U.S.A., and may be of little interest to people outside of that country. In particular, if the sections on politics or sports make you more than chuckle occationally, it is a clear sign that you've been watching way too much american television recently.Overall, it is not a bad book - however, neither it is as hillarious as some reviews would make you believe."
5,Very funny.,Great book - very funny. It is fascinating (and very educational) to see how wrong people can be. I will never believe in the word impossible again!
1,Not a serious book; but OK for the PC crowd,"I noticed many of the quotes were taken out of context, inaccurate, or were off-the-cuff comical/facetious remarks. Some of the ""researched facts"", are nothing more than partisan political opinions. It's a wonderful database kit for the left wing bumper-sticker intellectual. Of course, there's barely any quotes from the Clinton administration; but then again, Clinton's gaffs would require a 2 volume set alone! It is an interesting read, in that you get a sense of how the PC crowd shamelessly struggles to deconstruct history and facts. I'm sure Cerf and his staff giggled the whole time they were assembling the quotes for the educated derelict. Fortunately, most students of history are not that shallow-minded. Do some serious reading, and pass this silly tripe up. The title says it all: ""Misinformation""."
5,Nice Art Set,I got this for my daughter's 8th birthday. She loves it! She draws pictures and then goes over them with a wet brush. Turns out very nice.
3,"Very good in a pinch, small convenient","I've been living in northeastern Bosnia for 6 months now and I'm learning the Bosnian language. I know some people will say that their is no such creature as the bosnian language, only croation and serbian, however, I live here and their are many words that are the same in all three dialects but their are certianly words that are pronounced differently in each of the three dialects. I like this dictionary. I've bought three of them. Only one of them was missing the S thru T section. One complaint I have about it is that it doesn't state which dialect the words are used in. If you have a little help from a local bosnian person though, this is a good and inexpensive book that will help you learn the language. It has plenty of good words to help you communicate in Bosnia."
3,"Small and Handy, but not complete.","It's a nice small dictionary that is handy to carry around, but mine was lacking about 30 pages, and it's not something you'd want as a desktop as it's not easy on the eyes."
4,Not Your average western!,"While this isnt the best western ever written, its definetly worth reading. This is a gritty realistic western that is refreshing as the main character actually gets hurt, he isnt immune to bullets like some westerns i've read. He even misses his shots occasionally! The author doesnt use excessive detail on surroundings etc., enough to get his point across. I highly recommend it, as this book is a very realistic portrayal of how the west really was. Not everyone liked everyone, people die, good and bad! If you like happy endings, this isnt exactly the book your looking for. I hope to see more books from Mr. Laing. The main cons about this book was it seemed to end to soon. :-)"
1,DVD has some kind of regional Lock.,"Beware! This DVD doesn't work in all Areas /Regions. Will not work in DVD player, must send back!This is a FIVE point movie! Has the original Doc Marten!"
3,Touching and funny.,"Great movie, very enjoyable. Love the Corwall setting and the eclectic characters. Can't beat Craig and Brenda together."
2,A real heart racer,"I purchased these pills thinking I could cure or at least help my Thyroid issues but I was wrong! They say it's a more Natural way of helping Hypothyroidism but all it does is keep me awake and it makes my heart race! Neither one of these is what I want because it's not a good feeling at all. I noticed allready this morning that my hair is falling out too! I'd think twice if I were you about trying this product, there has to be a better way."
2,Zero change,Unfortunately Thyroid Support did not help my symptoms but I purchased the product without medical determination that I actually suffer from hypothyroidism.
4,It works..,"I started using this product since yesterday and it seems to be helping, I use it only when symptoms crop up - at that peak (not as prescribed).--x--x--Just as an update.. after couple of days.. This stuff is indeed a miracle. Based on my exp, it should be taken when one feels the symptoms the most (like any other homeopathic remedy) however it wont be vise to exceed the recommended daily limit.Btw, I also take adrenal support by gaia, which is a wonderful supplement. I also take salt (sea salt a pinch) and sugar (cane sugar brown, half tablespoon) mixed in water (I take it as first thing in the morning and then at bed time), it works for me.. I have observed that any good multivitamin already has 100% of the recommended daily dose of iodine, so I do not want to take anymore then that, as too much of iodine can as well create thyroid issues."
3,Not sure.,I'm not sure if this product works or not. I have taken it for a month and so far I haven't noticed any changes. I guess you will just have to try it yourself.
1,It's great except... it doesn't print,"After spending at least an hour designing a nice-looking label, I go to print it, and I get an ""Out of Memory"" dialog box; the app is frozen and I have to kill it. I restart my computer and... same thing. Quite frustrating. (I've never had this problem with any other software, and I do have a decent machine.) I emailed their support, and I still haven't heard anything in 3 weeks. So I can't give it more than one star.The software looks great and does everything except print, but unfortunately that's the most important thing. I had to download a different shareware program and adjust its printing dimensions to match the Burlington paper (which seems decent, by the way). It might actually work for you... but it might not."
5,forgotten classic,"This mini-series is a great powerful story, with a fantastic cast which as far as I am concered, ranks up their with Rich Man, poor man , Roots and the Thorn Birds. They just don't make them like this anymore."
4,American Political Epic,"This great american fiction by Taylor Caldwell chronicles the ficticious Joseph Armah's rise to financial and political power in the late 19th century.The story draws liberally from real life stories of Joseph Kennedy and J.D. Rockerfeller.Gripping with political intrigue and love interests.Anyone with an interest in the inner workings of business in the dawning stages of the industrial age, and backroom politics will find this miniseries a must see."
3,Storms and music,"In the other reviews for this product, as well as the product description, should probably have mentioned that this product was a music overlaying storm disc. I prefer thunderstorms only, but if you are looking for this type of CD then this is an excellent aquisition."
3,disappointed...,"i find this album to be lacking the dancehall flavor that i rate beenie man for. I do like some of the songs on here, actually i LOVE bad girl, which is a hot riddim done by the Neptunes go-figure. i actually place bad girl as a reggae song, pretty gal is good, riddim is lacking, but it can work. ms LAP on the buy out riddim is hot, and i think in all, this album would be much better if it had more DANCEHALL REGGAE songs. I rate beenie man for his old reggae tracks from back in the day, he needs to go back to doing what works...OLE DOG LIKE WE...buy it if you want to support the artist, but if it is to actually enjoy, skip till the next one, hopefully it will be in the reggae genre"
3,nothing new,"It seems to me that the people interwieved in this book have a somewhat similar take on sexuality. I would have enjoyed a more diverse group of voices that also exist in the pagan community like someone who think BDSM is opressive, someone who think polarity and male/female coupling is the only form of true wicca, someone who belives you should be legally handfasted to have sex or kids, celibacy etc. This book as it is now just gives me nothing new. Sad on such an interesting subject."
1,this book has steep criticism and long on-going sentences,the book is very interesting-in a bad way.... it has very bad taste in what is really going on and the lame compare-and-contrast examples show very little of anything ... a definite two thumbs down on this one
2,Bad DVD In one of the boxes,Bad DVD in one of the boxes. Right in the middle of a Sons of Anarchy Marathon. That's not fair.
2,Damaged goods,"Gave this to a friend as a gift. When they got to Season 2-Disc 3, it would not work. Very embarrasing."
5,Bluegrass at it's best,I bought this CD on a whim about the time it first came out and it quickly evolved to become among my favorite. Can't even begin to tell you how great this is but with all these talented people how could you go wrong. Good starter CD if you have just started listening to bluegrass. You won't go wrong.
1,Don't buy this if you respect Radiohead,"EMI are trying to rip-off fans with this compiliation.Go to buy In Rainbows instead, its brilliant."
4,"A good, updated look at Australian society","Take a look at the cover of this book. It shows 3 females, grandmother, mother and daughter. If you are a North American reader, they might initially appear to be black, or even Latino or Native American. But they are Australian Aborigines. (It's a painting by noted Australian artist Julie Dowling.)I point this out because the book concerns issues of gender in a predominantly British-descended society, not unlike those of the US and Canada. The twist here is that you can compare the issues raised in this book, and the Australian society from which they were derived, with those of your country.Not all the essays concern Aboriginal women. For example, one topic is about medical care in Australia between the World Wars; especially the availability of medical assistance to pregnant women. Another essay compares gender attitudes and rules in Australia, between the 1950s and 1990s.A good, updated look at Australian society."
3,good,"the item is extremely good when it comes to correct your posture but like it said on other reviews it does hurt your armpits a lot if you use it on your skin, if you use a t-shirt or something to protect your armpits you can still feel it but it does not hurt as much."
3,"Does the job, but not very comfortable","The product did remind me to keep my shoulders back, but it rubbed my armpits more than I would have liked. I haven't used it in the last 2-3 wks now. It is best to use it when you are mostly sedentary."
2,not convinced this is working,"I didn't feel a real difference in my posture when I wore this brace. First off, it was REALLY challenging to put on by myself and adjust squarely on my back. The shoulder straps are really wide so it's hard to cover up, esp in the summer where clothes are a lot less bulky and thin!! More importantly, I did not notice it being effective in helping me stand up straighter or keep my shoulders back...it was a conscious effort on my part to pull my shoulders back and stand straight - something I can do WITHOUT having this brace as a reminder. Overall, didn't find it to be too useful or effective!! :("
4,Pretty good.,"It works pretty well, but not perfect. Also I wish the instruction manual could be more clear and there were video to describe how it works."
4,just what i needed,one thing they didn't mention you have to cut stripes to make a good fet of it >>> . .
5,A brace that works brilliantly for posture correction and back pain relief,"I have had severe upper-mid back pain, specifically at T5,6, for the past 3 years. I had an old brace that I purchased at a pharmacy years ago, but it was too uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes. This product however is very comfortable and I am able to wear it all day. My posture is perfect and the mid back support relieves pain to the point were I can function throughout the day. In addition, the brace is adjustable so that after eating, I can loosen it and still keep it on. The brace also helps remind me to pull in my upper abdominal muscles to correct my posture even further. After two weeks of wearing this, I have stronger abs, better posture and significant reduction in pain."
4,helpful product,"I have always had poor posture, partly inherited, partly habit. This brace is pretty comfortable and will probably get more so as I become accustomed to wearing it. The first time I wore it I immediately felt better! Doesn't work under thin, fitted tops but great under looser clothing. Wish I would have tried one sooner!"
4,works for me,I choose this item to wear while sleeping and it's helped. It's strong and adjustable. Would be noticable if worn under clothes.
2,Used only once,"Bought it after reading good reviews, but used it only once. It pinches the underarm and shoulder so much that you forget about your back pain."
3,it help but with some discomfort,the lateral bands that goes at front and slide under the shoulder creating a discomfort and scratch litle bit the skin. It require a permanet use of a t-shirt to use the corrective brace.
2,Complicated and bulky,"This product takes forever to put on and shifts. It hurts. The brace is bulky and shows through clothes. After 1 week I tossed this because it is a hassle to get on, a hassle to wear, uncomfortable, bulky with poor design."
4,Simple but functional,"This works, but it simple and you have to understand it.Yes, there can be pain if you have it too tight or your body type doesn't work with this type.You also need to wear this over a light shirt so it is not against your skin.I use it with an undershirt, then cover it with a sweater or long sleave shirt.I wear it 1/2 to a whole day at a time...but not every day.It reminds me to stand straight and keep my shoulders back.The more i fight it, then it can be uncomfortable...but pull your shoulders back and it is fine.Don't over tighten...and adjust to a comfort level. It should not cut into your under arms [although body type may not prevent this type of discomfort.]I feel a great relief taking it off at end of day, but within 24 hours my back is a lot better.Been wearing it about twice a week to work and usually leave it on all day.I'm giving it 4 stars because it is not high end, but very simple yet functional for my posture correction."
3,A little too pragmatic.,"I am currently using this book, along with Relevance by Sperber & Wilson, for a Linguistic Pragmatics course. The material is interesting but the manner in which it reads is not very engaging. That makes for a challenging time trying to grasp the points the author is trying to convey."
4,Great Thriller,Karen Robards is an exciting author. This book keeps you hanging and is a real page turner!
3,SOMEWHAT BORING,HAD A HARD TIME KEEPING FOCUSED ON THE STORY. RATHER BORING. HOPE THE NEXT BOOK SHE WRITES IS BETTER.
4,Great Read from Beginning to End!,"Robards does not disappoint. This story is filled with everything for all types of readers (romance, thriller, drama, etc.)After reading some of the reviews that were posted on Amazon, I was a bit skeptical to continue reading (fearing that the ending would be left unclear)but I'm glad I continued. The ending ties the story together and leaves the reader content. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a thriller/mystery!"
1,Could it have gotten any worse?,"Without a doubt one of the worst movies ever produced!Looked like it had been filmed using my Backberry Video Camera. And, ermmm...DMC on the front cover? Why? He had about a total of 10 lines in 4 appearances! Honestly, if I could I'd get my money back!"
4,Great,An excellent collection of music. A few sound like they could have come off of a Satriani album. Rik shows he can play bluesy rock with the best of them. A whole new style is shown on this album. A keeper for any Rik Emmett fan.
1,Not worth the cost,All of the addresses are C/O a team or Association. You could spend 10 minutes online and get all of the addresses in this book. Very dissapointed!
5,Enlightening Book; Truly Amazing Counsels,"This book is truly enlightening; Geronda Ephraim writes with such humility and eloquence you. His counsels are true spiritual medicine for the struggling Christian. However, I would recommend this book only for Orthodox Christians or those studying the Orthodox faith, as other Christians may not appreciate its full splendor!"
2,Not worth your time,"I bought it expecting to read ""arguments against evolutionary psychology."" I don't know where I got that idea. Most of the book deals with issues not particularly relevant to the issue. Furthermore, EP is often mischaracterized, so the arguments made against it aren't useful. Also, the arguments are poor and generally don't lead to the claimed conclusions. The first three chapters were so bad I almost quit.There are some good points and ideas in this book. Unfortunately, they're well hidden. One clear exception, Annette Karmiloff-Smith's contribution to this collection is excellent. There are a couple of other contributions that might be worth a read. However, much of the rest of the book is a complete waste of time."
2,"Nice idea, but flawed implementation","The idea of giving a good in-depth explanation of the underlying technologies (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.) is a good one, but unfortunately this book doesn't give *good* explanations. When the author gets such simple things as the difference between FTP & HTTP wrong, you have to wonder. When he goes on to describe a man-in-the-middle attack he claims SSL is subject to that it's not, and then gives a completely self-contradictory proposed solution, it's clear this book needed some competent technical reviewers before being published."
5,"Excellent, must read book for all women.","The Glory Cloak is an empowering book that shows what women can accomplish under the worst of circumstances. This novel centers around Clara Barton and Louisa May Alcott during and after the Civil War and ties their stories together through a fictional character named Susan that portrays a cousin to Louisa. This is the story of a lifelong friendship, women surviving and thriving while cleaning up the messes made my men and most importantly chronicles the accomplishments of women smart enough to stay single and childfree despite the pressures of society. I only wish I had read this book thirty years ago..."
5,awesome,the individual who received this dress is very happy with it. it arrived as promised and when it was scheduled to arrive
5,Beautiful Music,"My family and I thoroughly enjoy this latest work from Tingstad and Rumbel. Yes, the music differs from their more recent albums, but within their new expression it is easy to identify these talented musicians. The group is not stagnant, and this should be applauded. We can enjoy their body of work, especially Acoustic Garden, while looking forward to what they may offer up next. And we can know it will be beautiful music."
5,It's as beautiful as it looks like on this site,"I bought this bracelet to complete my opal jewelry set and I'm very content with it.The opal has beautiful bright colors, even nicer than you can see in the picture.I really recommend this bracelet."
3,IT ISN'T GOOD MOVIE!!!,I SAW THIS MOVIE AND I WAS UPSET. BECAUSE THIS MOVIE WAS NOT GOOD AS I THOUGHT. THIS MOVIE WAS BAD AND THE WHOLE STORY WAS BAD. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT REMAKE FILM BUT IT'S NOT. THIS MOVIE WAS FAILING BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE TOO SHORT.
1,BAD REMAKE!!!,When I saw they would be remaking my favorite J-Horror movie in the US I was excited but nervous. Apparently I was right to be so!...it sucked it didn't even end right....they completely screwed that part up!.....Of course I don't know what I expected when they couldn't even get the ring tone right. The original was much better in terms of acting (although I will say the mane female lead did well) and they didn't have the cheap Hollywood scares that the US versions of movies seem so intent on using.....it was just a really great psychological horror movie...that gave you a lot more to think about at the end than its American counter part....my opinion see the original and forget this crappy remake was ever done!
2,Bargain-Basement Dick.,"This book is early Dick, not the shaggy-dog's-tale, brilliantly-crazy 60's Dick, not as searing or sad as 70's Dick. As close to mainstream sci-fi as Dick gets, and if you've read much Phil K. Dick, less enjoyable. Parts are like Flannery O'Connor on real bad acid, which sounds better than ""The World Jones Made"" reads"
1,A terrible disappointment...,"A bisque is defined as ""a thick cream soup made from shellfish."" While this soup understandably lacks the shellfish (it's salmon after all), it also inexplicably lacks cream! It's got milk and vegetable oil (which predominates) instead, and it is not a concentrate! What a disappointment in taste, especially as we are fans of Bar Harbor's delicious chowders (salmon and clam... haven't tried the lobster). Pass on this if you know what a bisque should taste like."
2,Tastes okay but...,"I actually liked the taste and texture as they were pleasant. But I warn you that it's exactly what the ingredients list says: tapioca thickened water and milk with a touch of salmon. Fishy taste, not much salmon, lots of thickening. Way too expensive for what you get so I won't repurchase but it's edible so we'll finish it."
3,Lighthearted amateur sleuth mystery,"This one reminds me a bit of Nancy and Ned in the old Nancy Drew books. It's hard to take a mystery seriously when the main character is named Bubbles and the guy's name (well, his last name) is Stiletto. Bubbles, true to her name, looks frothy and wears Spandex, but we're to believe a mind hides beneath the hair spray (reminiscent of Legally Blonde) as she investigates what appears to be theft, extortion and maybe murder.Totally silly, but fun."
1,Elvis Movies,I didn't care for this DVD at all. This was a really quick preview of all the movies he made. A waste of money.
2,What About Elvis?,"I've seen MIB I numerous times. What I'm trying to find out is this....what was the name of the song that Tommy Lee Jones had on 8-track? I know it was by Elvis, but I cannot figure out the name of the song. Any help out there?"
1,Where is it?,"I'd love to review this product, except that I never received it. When the deadline passed, I sent an email to the seller to say that if it was in transit, I would be refusing it, I received no response. I wonder if this seller even exists."
4,"well, great except for 1 thing!","OK, this was a great movie and I CAN NOT wait til it comes out on DVD, but the only thing that was bad about the soundtrack was the B5 song. I mean, what is that noise? They can not do that. Sometimes, it works, sometimes it doesn't. In this case, it DEFINETELY doesn't work."
5,hi,"i loved loved loved the movie and i thought the soudtrake was amazing. i downloaded the whole album onto my ipod, and i love it!!!!!"
1,disturbing...,"I saw this movie at a birthday party, and may I just say that I was extremely shocked and mystified at what on earth Disney was thinking when they showed/created this movie on/for their channel.The song between Sharpay and her BROTHER Ryan, Bop to the Top, is filled with sexual references and double entendres and positively reeks of incest.There is also another similar scene between the male lead and his father in the locker room that I won't even get into.Also, the voices used, not so good. Despite the fact that it isn't even usually the actors singing (why hire leads for a musical that can't sing)the replacement voices are nasal-y and overenhanced. The actor who plays Ryan in the film is the only talented one of the group.I walked away from this movie feeling like it was a bad dream, that's how bizarre and unusual it is."
1,OVERATED!!!!,"High School Musical is a good movie. But they can stop with the soundtrack. All you hear is ""Were All In This Together"". Yeah right, thats why Vanessa and Ashley fight over Zac. And Corbin wants the spotlight off of Zac and on himself. Just a weird and messed up Cast."
5,High School Musical Is Awesome!,High School Musical is the best musical I have seen this year. The CD and Movie is great and I can't wait to watch it again tonight. If there is one musical to see WATCH HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL on the disney channel tonight and tommorrow at 8.
5,Gift for Niece,My niece loved it! She sang all of New Year's Eve. I am please with the delivery time.
5,"Light, fun and very very catchy","I actually bought this cd without ever hearing the music - because there was so much hype about it and because it was so popular, I thought I was bound to like it. I do like it. In fact I love it. The songs are really catchy and fun and I admit I love to sing along. Disney were onto something here and they have a big hit again. I can't wait for the movie to be released in May so I can go buy it. I know it's going to be as great as the soundtrack. I can't stop playing it."
3,Meh....,"Well, it wasn't a total disaster. If you watched the movie (why else would you look at the soundtrack?), you know the songs weren't half bad, but the moral was horrific. We're all special in our own way? From my stand point, the moral was that the people who have the most talent (athletics & singing, academics & singing, athletics &.... baking?) are the ones who end up happy, while the ones with only one talent (like the siblings) get forced to the back.Well, this is for the soundtrack, so moral aside, it has some good numbers in it, particularly ""Breaking Free""."
1,Sigh-Disney screws up again,"OK, it wasn't a total trainwreck but it could've been WAY better. First of all, the musci was very bland and forgettable. I've heard more memorable toons on ""The Lizzie Mcquire Movie"" and thats saying something. The acting was mediocre. The man girl, Gabriela, looked like she was in a music video in her solo. It was painful to watch. The entire thing was just too unrealistic to me about highschool life. ON the voices, well, it sounded very very very computerized. You can tell these aren't the kids real voices. I'm not sure which one is worse-""From Justin to Kelly"" or this run of the mill second rate attempt at a decemt movie musical. Sorry Disney-this one should be flushed down the toilet."
5,Best Disney Soundtrack!,"I love this soundtrack!! My favorite songs are Bop to the Top by Sharpey and Ryan, We're in this together by the high school musical cast and stick to the status quo by the high school musical cast! I loved this movie!"
5,A GREAT C.D.,This is a fun C.D. that adults can enjoy with/without their kids! We are all looking forward to the DVD release.
4,Frankly I don't like the movie but...,"The sound track rocks! The movie is not one of the best, and neither is the plot, but the music is just great. I would never have even watched High School Musical if it weren't for the fact that they played part of 'Breaking Free' in the comercials."
3,Not A Complete Album,"I hate it when record companies cut tracks off the original LP when they reproduce it on CD. This is a prime example of what I am talking about. The original album titled ""TO THE SILENT MAJORITY WITH LOVE"" on Nugget Records had 12 tracks. So 3 tracks have been cut out of the CD.I love Harlan Howard, both voice and songwriting ability. They should not have done this to such a great entertainer. I give 3 stars because only 75% of the original album was copied onto CD."
3,#1 on the charts,"I found this cd to be more up beat than her others. It was kinda refreshing. I love Enya's music but, if someday you would like something a little more upbeat you should listen to the first and last song. I liked the Christmas song Silent Night also. At first when they were playing the title song on the radio I thought I would go to the music store and buy it. When I saw the price I said no way am I going to pay that for one song. But when I looked at the tracks on the cd I was pleasantly suprised to see there was not one but two extra songs as well. I really liked them all! Give it a try!!!"
2,THEY SHOULD HAVE KEEP IT LIKE THE ORIGINAL!,"The single remix sounds like a train comin' up!, the original version is way superior, of course I don't argue with Enya's voice, wich I consider an enchanting vogaye, what a great voice she has, the xmas song is ok, the best thing is the bonus track!, but this single should have been extremely well done, if the cd had included the original, and the mix along, well for enya fans is ok!"
3,Could be better,"The song Only Time is beautiful, Enya is a great singer, but it was somewhat disappointing to find out that there are only two songs and another piece of music. I don't think I'll ever buy an audio CD without being able to listen to samples or at least read what songs are there."
3,Too Short,Thought I was buying an album and it only had 3 songs on it. I am kind of new on buying c.d.'s on line.
5,Be sure to follow this up with Part 2!,"Paracelus is my personal favorite of the ""famous alchemists."" He took an approach that diverged greatly from his contemporaries: ""harmony of the man is the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm."" He veered from soul purification and concentrated on how bodies got out of natural balance and how he could cure them. He summarized his own views by saying: ""Many have said of Alchemy, that is for making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines."" And I am sure that many of the pharmaceutical giants today wholeheartedly agree with him! The work is fascinating as well as the man. This book as well as Part 2 bring him fully to light for all of us to appreciate!"
5,"Not Better, But Just as Good as Ten and Vs.","Yield is simply an awesome disc. It's first 4 tracks are incredible, but so are ""Do the Evolution"" and ""Pilate"". One other thing I loved about this CD is the inclusion of a secret song at the end of the disc a few minutes after the last track ends!"
5,One of the greatest albums ever,"This is the best album released since... oh, since ""No Code"" in 1996 - Pearl Jam is god, get this album, itll rock your socks offPearl Jam forever"
2,TRYING TO SOUND LIKE CREED HUH?,"what a bad band, want good music check out creed. much better.p.s= u2 is still the best band in the world"
4,Good on its own; good as a nostalgia piece,"There are a lot of books I liked as a kid that I can't really recommend to my grandchildren. Too slow, too sappy, too simple, just too sexist or racially insensitive; you get the idea.The appeal of this book is that it is still fun to read now, and it gives a modern young reader an idea of what was hot stuff when grand-dad was a kid."
5,Like going back in time. I LOVE this series,"Our teacher read the first one to us in third grade. I continued to read the series on my own. I am now shopping for them - almost 35 years later - for my son. I wish I could find the entire series. Please Amazon, can you get the others? I am sure my son will love this book as much as I did."
2,"Ehh, it was alright for what it costs",Well heres a book that ya get what ya pay for. It only costs about 8 dollars so it wasnt a total loss but the information is really basic and boring. Pretty much each page gas a snall circular or square talisman on it with a description and how to make it. Its certaintly not what I wanted it to be but again I got what i paid for.
1,Better Ways To Write To Stars,"This book is pretty useless, which I don't really feel is the author's fault. Celebrities probably change contact info all the time and it's impossible to keep up.I am an autograph collector and I have found the best way to get autographs (most specifically for celebrities) is to find the address of the network their TV show is on and write to them in care of the network.I have probably gotten responses on 90% of the letters I have sent. I think that would be much more effective than buying this book and getting most of your letters returned due to wrong addresses."
3,Many addresses no longer valid,"Many of the addresses were no longer vaild.We spent many dollars on stamps and envelopes to find this out. It is just the luck of the draw if it happens to get to the one it was addressed to.Most corporations and Goverment addresses were correct.Thank you,MrO2@aol.com"
5,Beautiful cleaned up version!,"I own the original DVD of this movie which is full of streaks, scratches and poor quality sound - almost like a bootleg would be. I bought this version hoping it would be higher quality and it is beautiful! It was well worth re-purchasing this movie to get the better quality. The subtitles are much better on this version too.If you have never seen this movie buy it and enjoy it. It is one of the best movies ever!"
1,Please do NOT buy this DVD! Horrible..,"Add my voice to the chorus of ""great movie - spoiled by poor DVD quality.""Rent a video if you haven't seen it - then wait for a (hopefully)future release without the horrid ""Engrish"" subtitles and scratchy picture."
3,Amazing movie...bad dvd quality,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers.I'm sort of glad I bought this film because the story (and Gong Li) was splendid.However, the dvd quality and subtitles was awful.I really hope this comes out again in a much better-quality transfer (along with some of Gong Li's other movies), as I'd buy it again."
1,A Terrible DVD Transfer of a Masterpiece,"I will repeat what other reviewers have said about this DVD.....DO NOT BUY!!!!!! This wonderful film has been destroyed by one of the worst DVD transfers I've ever seen. Filthy scratched video, distorted audio and inaccurate and poorly spelt subtitles. Do NOT Buy, this masterpiece deserves better and so do buyers who pay for movies rather than downloading them."
1,"Great Film, Poor Transfer to DVD","Like others listed here I have waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD. Raise the Red Lantern is one of my all time favorite movies. I think I have watched it at least a dozen times. I already own a VHS copy but liked the movie so much I wanted something that would last longer than a VHS tape. After this long wait boy was I disappointed. Not only is the picture poor, (lots of lines, distortions and poor color), but someone rewrote the translations. Also, not only were words changed, there were a lot of spelling errors. As for widescreen, it is the weirdest widescreen I have ever seen. It is like someone put a rectangular box over the picture and one side of the box moves! I feel bad giving this great five star movie one star but I think people should be aware of the quality of this DVD."
1,"Great Film, Horrible DVD Transfer!","I knew it. From the moment I saw the distributor's clip play in front of the title screen, I just knew that this transfer was going to be crap - I was not disappointed in this respect. The sound? Like it was recorded from an oscillating speaker. The picture? I am convinced that someone personally applied scratches, grit and god knows what else to each and every frame - they might have also bleached it as the colors are both dull and overblown at once. And the sub-titles? Prease, do not odd started me get mister.All I can say is what a shame, what a disappointment! Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful film which I would recommend to anyone, however this DVD is appalling. I'm not alone in this feeling, as you can read for yourself in the other reviews. All I can do is caution any of you interested in watching this movie to try for the VHS version and avoid the DVD at all costs and hope for the day that this wonderful film is finally given a proper DVD treatment."
1,A great film ruined,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. I also absolutely love this movie. However, the quality of this DVD honestly couldn't be alot worse. It does indeed look like a very bad job was done of ""taping"" this movie. It looks like an old VHS tape you might have that was copied from a copy (that itself had been copied from another copy). The translations are extremely poor (my initial thought was they had gotten a person whose primary language was Chinese, and that didn't speak English very weel to translate the movie). Also, they only translate the audio...any characters written on the screen are not translated.If you've seen the version of this movie on the premium cable channels, don't expect to see that same quality. That is not the version you get on the DVD. Had I known this, I certainly would have passed on this DVD. If you want the good version, go for the VHS tapes."
3,raise the red lantern,The DVD quality was good but there were no subtitles!I watched it anyway. I had somewhat a sense of the story.
1,"I laughed (at the subtitles), I cried (at the transfer) ...","I second the reviews below. This is a 5-star movie, but the quality of this transfer is horrible. Parts of the movie are very scratchy and full of film debris. Worst yet, to me, are the subtitles. They are laughable. Almost every subtitle contained some error. While it was (sorta) fun to laugh and the odd subtitles, that tended to remove me emotionally from the film. Too bad. The same comments apply to the ""Ju-Dou"" release from this same company."
1,"Yes, there's are better Yimou Zhang's movies than The House... and Hero","Yimou Zhang took a great novella by Su Tong, added red lanterns, and made one compelling beautiful film. However, the transfer of this DVD is a travesty. From the appearance of the main titles one would think this is a bootleg version of the film. The scratches, the poor sound quality, and the inaccurate English subtitles make the watching of this DVD a painful experience. It's a shame that such a visually and musically stunning film has to suffer from corporate greed. Do yourself a favor... See this movie on Bravo."
1,Listen to Tony Polito!,"His review is spot on--the transfer on this film is horrible. The VHS is much better quality, with more fidelity both to sound and to color. From a transfer standpoint, it almost looks like an early-70s film in terms of the washed-out look of it.Hopefully someone will have the decency to come out with a new version of this (and please--release Red Sorghum, too!) that treats it with the respect it deserves."
1,I had to stop watching...,"Like almost every other recent reviewer, I have been waiting years for this beautiful movie to be released on DVD...what a disappointment. I can only reiterate what everyone else has said - the film quality is so bad and the translation is so ridiculous that about 15 minutes into it I just had to turn it off. I have never seen such a poor-quality DVD! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF THE DVD! It's a piece of junk and does no justice to the absolute beauty of the original movie."
4,mine is in stereo,"I ordered a copy of this Magic Records France release in Sept 06 from Amazon UK, and my copy is in stereo. While the overall sound is not perfect, and I don't have the original vinyl to compare it against, it sounds very good to me on most tracks, a little weak on just a few. I'm extremely glad I was finally able to get a copy of this long lost album. As for the music, the songs are pretty good even if they're not great. And even though Allan Clarke wasn't on board for this album (he is credited on 2 of the bonus tracks), the trademark Hollies harmonies are there in full bloom. Long live The Hollies!!"
4,Four and a half stars!,I loved this book and Candle in the Darkness but I wish that they had Fire by Night for the Kindle. That one is my favorite in the trilogy. Please request it amazon.com so we can all enjoy it!
5,Microsoft Pciture It Publisher Platinum 2002,This is probably one of the best all around advanced amatuer graphics programs available from MicroSoft. Greater features than later graphics programs such as Microsoft Picture It Premium Ver.10 2004 which has a smaller selection of fonts and less felxibilty for imaginative creation. This is well worth the purchase if your looking for a relatively simple to use graphics program offering greater potential to advance your skills within the confines of the program itself. Fine even in XP.
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!,"The rating of one star is only because there is no ZERO!! Garbage In, Garbage Out, the credo of computer geeks, also applies to software. MS ""PICTURE IT! PUBLISHING PLATINUM"" is GARBAGE. The software simply does not perform. It crashes frequently, the tools are not intuitive, there is no user manual and the help library leaves somewhat to be desired. Do not depend on this product to get the job done, particularly if you are new to publishing an amature WEB site. This software is not reliable when running with Windows-98 on a 800 MHz 40-GB Dell Dimension-Plus. Microsoft is correct when stating that a lot of work is needed in software development and reliability. This product proves the point. Perhaps a change in the product Name should also be considered."
2,And another thing...,"There is another problem that I do not see mentioned here.All of the images that were included under Arttoday.com, are pretty much useless. CD #5 by the way. All of the images are thumbnails and therefore are not able to be enlarged. There is a 3 month membership to Arttoday included, but one would be tempted to replace the images that should already be included. I contacted Arttoday and Microsoft to see if I could get usable pictures but to no avail.I didn't have as many problems that a lot of the other users had ( I have XP, 256RAM, Epson Printer) but I did have a lot of crashes and green boxes. So I did return the program after speaking to Microsoft online, who was very helpful by the way. Arttoday seemed annoyed that I even asked for a repair ofwhat I had already paid for.I would have liked to have kept the program, for there were a lot of other nice images since I am a novice, but it was frustrating locating an image and then finding out I couldn't use it."
2,A So-So Product,"I agree with much of what other reviewers had written on Picture It, yet I can get it to work more than what they could. It does not produce what the product claims it does. It's slow and does not have as much editing tools such as Print Shop or Photo Deluxe has. Better to save your money and buy Photo Deluxe especially if you are working with photos."
2,Doesn't work with Lexmark X73 for printing envelopes,"I was extremely disappointed with this software. Although it works fine for photo editing and creating greeting cards I have spent many hours trying to get a envelope to print correctly. No matter how I put the envelope in the printer it just never comes out right. I'm either missing part of the picture or the text or it's not centered, etc. I've even contacted Lexmark because at first I thought it was my printer. But it definitely is NOT my printer but the software."
1,A Very Poor Product,Typical of Microsoft this product offers no basic information for the novice digital photographer. The format is poor. Trying to find information to even begin to use the product is impossible. A very frustrating product that I wouldn't recommend. This is a VERY POOR PRODUCT. STAY AWAY!
2,One of Pino's weakest efforts,"I'm a huge Pino Daniele fan: I have listened to almost all his music and I must say that I was disappointed with this album: there is hardly any memorable melody on this CD. The ones preceding this one are much better: Cosa Succede Sulla Terra (five stars) and Non Calpestare I Fiori Nel Deserto (four to five stars). So better start there and don't forget to check out his earlier wonderful works like Nero A Metà, Bell'mbriana and Vai Mo' or the collection Passa O Tiempo Che Fà, as they are beautiful examples of his beautiful melodic bland of different musical influences. Listening to his music provides you with a great mood!"
1,Too much,Like all Microsoft programs they think you have to use their network. Why a screen of specials just write a good basic program that does cards and leave the rest out.
2,"Nice, but crashes all the time","I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. Like everything about it, but make sure you save at every step. You still may have problems, but at least you stand a chance to recover. I have yet to get all the way through printing a card without it crashing at least once. Sometimes it corrupts the file you were working on, so even if you DID save it, it may or may not be recoverable.The interface is nice and all, but it's very frustration to take an hour to make a card that SHOULD have taken 5 minutes."
2,Just Okay,While the designs were cute and the paint colors vibrant.I was sad to noticed that when I went to peel the designs off the window the design cracked.If the window is very cold and you go to move your design it will crack.On hot days over time your design fades.Yet it's a cute project to keep th kids busy.Yetyou have to be patient(as the drying time is 24 hours)Plus youneed a real steady hand.
2,Cracked and broke in half,"Liked the product a lot until all 3 of them wore down and cracked and broke in half, Not a very durable product at all."
3,Not bad bad but strong oder,"I have been using this product on and off fora while. Generally speaking, not a whole lot cat go wrong using it, its just rubber donut. But the couple of things I don't like and a turn off for me and my wife to use is the chemical oder that it has. I though it would disappear after some use, but a month of so later, its still there and strong. The other thing is that some how it traps the finger skin which makes rather uncomfortable using after a while."
5,last rung on the ladder to Aja..,"Aja is a the finest SD album, arguably the finest album period, and The Royal Scam was an essential prelude to it. SD was headed toward a near perfect production like an Aja and TRS was a worthy preamble. It's downright amazing how a couple of guys from NY were able to create such convincing southern CA imagery. And for those of you who love lead guitar, here is one of the finest demonstrations compliments of Larry Carlton. I can't imagine this music ever sounding dated."
5,Smart and Smooth......,"The album where Steely Dan rounded the corner to a new creative high. Utilizing superior sidemen(Larry Carlton, Dean Parks, Chuck Rainey, Bernard Purdie, etc...) to augment their sound, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen created a masterpiece with ""The Royal Scam"". Songs like ""Kid Charlemagne"", ""Don't Take Me Alive"" and, ""Green Earrings"" are standards in the Steely Dan songbook, but there's really not a bad track on this album at all. Perfectly remastered by the group's long time engineer Roger Nichols, and new liner notes by Becker and Fagen is reason enough for long time fans to pick this up again. For those of you discovering this album for the first time, you're in for more than a pleasant surprise."
4,the buck,"How many other musicians in ANY genre would not give a decade of their lives up for a hat trick like Royal Scam, Aja and Gaucho over the course of a career?Think about it. Who comes Close?I have always felt that 'Royal Scam' (RS) is the most overlooked issue in the SD catalog, perhaps arguments can be made for 'Pretzel Logic' and 'Aja' for primacy, however the work of Larry Carlton on 'RS' tips the scales. I can still hear the entire guitar solo and fade from ""Kid Charlemagne"" in my head at the drop of a hat.Listen to the radio today, if you can bear to...NO ONE is out there doing anything like this; no one has and likely no one will. It may have been over a 1/4 century ago, but like a bright gem, this still shines and glistens."
5,Some of their best songs,"The storytelling and wittiness of the lyrics, and the incredible musicianship make this one of the very best Steely Dan albums. Kid Charlemagne, Haitian Divorce, The Fez, Don't Take Me Alive, are all incredible. Great album!"
5,Must have remaster,Personally I think this might be the best Steely Dan did but we all have opinions. The lead guitar really comes out and being a remaster brings out all the intruments very well. This whole album is great throughout ... not a bad song on it.
5,Classic Steely Dan,"Awesome !!! If you're a Steely Dan fan just buy it, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a fan you probably won't need to read this but buy it anyway ..."
1,Could be better,"I usually love everything that Michael Card does, but this album was not one of his better ones. I guess every artist has to had a bad one once in a while."
2,Expect Error & Low Memory Messages Constantly,"I do not highly recommend this software. It was easy to install, but that's about the only good thing about it. Ever since I have installed this software, I get error messages EVERY single time I go into it to use it. If you download 5 pictures and want to crop, etc. in PICTURE IT!, the program can barely hold all the photos at once without running out of memory. And forget about attempting to crop all photos in succession. The program will ALWAYS shut down on you and you will end up re-booting your computer a million times before you are done. Also, most of the graphics for this software are not downloaded with the initial program, so everytime you want to do a project with one of the PICTURE IT! images, you have to insert one of the CD roms just to get the picture. A hassle all around. I'm shopping around for better picture software right now........"
4,Good amateur program,"Picture It Publishing has been a great tool to develop cards, flyers, posters and general photo editing. It is easy to use and has an adequate amount of clips and effects to keep a novice happy (it is a lot easier than Photoshop when it comes to home publishing). I would recommend it, it has a few kinks but nothing unsurmountably wrong, and I've been pleased with the results."
5,Beautiful Creations,"For years Microsoft has been recognized as a leader in both the processing and publishing arenas. With their latest product, Microsoft Picture It Publishing 2002, they have finally broken their own mold. This product is not only practical but fun to use. Saving hundreds of dollars in graphical artist expenses. It allows the end user a pallette to create as well as enjoy their masterpieces. Take a simple photograph, choose one of many projests available and you have a lifetime of memories. With over 10,000 projects you'll never be bored. Imagine the wonders that can be accomplished with this simple to use software from a company that simply out does itself year after year. You will not be disappointed."
5,Best TextBook I have ever read.,"Quite honestly, this is the only text book that I have sat down to read on its own accord. The information is very useful and entertaining to boot. It discusses commercials and why we like them and how they appeal to us. It talks about movies, icons and cultural phenomenon that you can identify with. Just sit down, read the first chapter, and you will understand why this is a quality text book."
4,Works as advertised,This irrigation timer worked fine for about 5 years and then stopped being reliable. The display digits lost some segments and I think one of the valves stopped working. Until then it worked fine so I bought another. The new one has been working fine for a month now. Configuration is a little difficult (read manual carefully) but you can get this to irrigate 2 (or 4 with more valves) areas regularly.
3,"Close enough , I guess.","The brass manifold failed on one of the outlets. The ball valve unscrewed itself whilst trying to eliminate leaks, and when I removed the automatic valve from the one bib, the innards came shooting out and I still haven't found the little ball from inside.Since I had mounted the thing and was using one zone at full pressure, I just reassembled the unit ( with some loc-tite) and got on with my life.If I had purchased it at the local Home Depot (which lowered their price to match after being advised they were being beat), I would have returned it for a replacement.This illustrates one difficulty with online buying, no one to return the item to without incurring an unreasonable delay.As product quality degrades, online purchasing becomes more risky.Everything was made in China, btw."
3,Works Well but Poor Description,"This says multiple times that it controls 4 stations. When you purchase this, you only recieve the ""controllers"" for 2 stations. (As shown in the picture). In order to control 4 stations, you must purchase 2 additional controllers for 10-15 each.Set-up was easy however, and had it working within 15 mintues. No leaks as of yet through the first week."
2,This timer is not what it appears....,"The concept of this timer is great -- A four station timer that you can quickly put together with Garden Hoses. The problem is that only two stations are included and the additional stations are almost impossible to get. As of this writing Amazon sells the two station kit but not the parts that you need to complete the system.You can find the parts on-line but they are always ""out of stock"". The local hardware store tried a special order but the company can't even give a date when the additional stations will become available.If you are trying to build a 2 station system this is an expensive alternative, if you are trying to build a 4 station system you will not be able to complete the project unless you buy another base kit. This product is a bait and switch."
2,Not all that...,"It does do 4 hoses....with the purchase of extra valves...BUT it truely does NOT take care of 4 different stations that require different frequencey of watering. If you are only doing lawns or flower beds you are ok...but we have lawns AND flower beds AND,planter boxes. You can't have a ""weds"" program different from ""saturday"" program. Every day must be the same. It wouldn't have been that hard when they designed the chip to make it so that each station could have it's own program. Sorry going back to my Melnor....4 timers, one each hose... : ("
3,Not surprising,"After World Cafe and East West, unfortunately I did not find Nostalgia is of the same exceptional standard. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic given their previous releases were pure magic. Nevertheless, Nostalgia still offers pleasant listening, if you do not mind a hint of new age."
2,Customer Service,"I bought the Rocket Pod to help store work data on. It was working great for awhile. The greatest thing since sliced bread. And then one day i come into work and it has stopped working. So I go to their website to try and get some technical support. To be able to get to technical support first you have to register the product. Okay not a big deal. Twenty minutes later, i'm still filling you a survey of my computer type and usage type and am no closer to technical support. Finally i get through all that, fill out my request for help and am told that i will get a response in three buisness days. I don't have time for them to take three days to get back to me, so i go looking for a phone number to call. The phone number is no longer in service. So before you buy this product, you might look for a company that has a little better customer service."
4,Great Laptop,"Bought the laptop for college, very few complaints. The built-in camera goes wonky every now and then, but aside from that, everything is great. Very sleek and stylish. It is rather large though, so not the most portable laptop around."
4,pretty good notebook,"I bought this notebook a week ago, it is a good notebook, great performance, great processor huge hard disk and the intel turbo memory is really good. The weak point of this notebook is its battery life. I still recommend it for those who like to listen music while working with the machine, or videoaddicts, the harman/kardon speakers and subwoofer are amazing."
5,Highly Recommended,"I bought this CD because I recognized the tunes from when I was younger. I have not seen the movie, nor do I really have any intention to; however, I love this CD. If you enjoy groups like New Order, The Cure, Depeche Mode but desire something a little harder you will love this CD. I really like Stabbing Westwards remake of ""Bizarre Love Triangle."" The song I bought the CD for is Mansons cover of ""Tainted Love,"" I love it! I'm glad somebody got the idea of doing harder remakes of some of the best 80's tunes. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to load the changer with this CD and my Ramones!:-)"
2,eh,"It's decent, but seeing as I own all the originals, I never listen to these remakes. Stabbing Westward made my ears bleed w/ the horrible rendition of Bizarre Love Triangle, and though Orgy's version of Blue Monday is pretty rocking, New Order's is much more interesting and sounds better. The only good track is Manson's version of Tainted Love. He take's an angry song and makes it agrier. I think this is the only one I like because the original didn't do much for me."
2,i want candy???,"where is the ""i want candy"" song by good charlotte it was in the movie i cant find it on any cd"
4,These bands do not belong on the same album as Scott Weiland,"That being said, it's always nice (albeit a little sad) to hear something new from the Pumpkins. I get the same feeling when I read an old Calvin and Hobbes book. Buy this album for 'But Not Tonight,' unless you're fourteen, in which case you'll love the rest of it anyway."
5,One of The Best Westerns Ever!,"Clint Eastwood is back in the saddle after a nine year break from the genre that made him famous. He plays the mysterious preacher, who comes to the aid of a settlement mining for gold.Watch for Richard Kiel the 7 foot actor who played Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me & Moonraker"
3,MIKE 2922 Is Full of It!,"I did read some (but not many) of his reviews. (I think he's about 15). He called this movie ""better than 'Unforgiven'."" (Where do these people come from?) This movie is like a rehash of ""High Plains Drifter"" with an embarrassing rip-off of Shane at the end. We get it, Clint, the otherwordly (possibly a ghost) avenger who helps the victims of the west. A well-done rehash for sure with Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, western veteran John Russell, and assorted other interesting faces. Thanks for moving onto ""Unforgiven"", ""Bridges of Madison County"", ""Mystic River"" and so many more. (Did one of your women inspire you?). There were mystical episodes of Clint's old TV show ""Rawhide"". Maybe that's why we had so many ""mystical"" avengers. Stick with William Munny. And ignore MIKE 2922 every time."
5,High Non redux,"Clint Eastwood appears - looms - in this gritty Western in the cowboy tradition of High Noon and Shane. Eastwood also directed Pale Rider, a movie in which he's known only as Preacher, because when he appears in town, he's wearing a clerical collar. Hard for the beleaguered miners (who are being terrorized by a smarmy land-grabbing tycoon and his band of local baddies) to figure out at first is whether Eastwood is a good guy or a bad guy. There's the requisite pretty woman and adoring child who belong to one of the miners, and it gives Eastwood to prove his intensions are high-minded.Classic Eastwood, classic cowboy, classic classic."
3,Decent Eastwood Western is hurt in comparison to Shane,"Pale Rider is worth watching, but unfortunately, it draws too heavily on George Stevens's classic western Shane, which just might be the greatest western ever made. It is well-acted and nicely shot, but it really can't hold a candle to Shane.Three stars."
5,Pale Rider a Winner,"Purchased as a gift for my brother-in-law, a Clint Eastwood fan, and he loved it. He recently got a 46""Samsung hi-def TV with bluray player and is astounded at the clarity of the picture. Thanks to Amazon movies are easy to find and affordable."
3,A good read,"Enjoyable first time read for me. Ms Burke must be tired of folks making comparisons to her father, but she has the knack of description and great plot develpment that must run in the family. To me, the plot(s) became confused and blurred as the book went on. Her courtroom detals were somewhat drawn out and I had to stick with the book all the way through. I will be back for more"
2,I'm Clueless,"I'm not sure if it's just me, but these guys are pretty bad. Their songs just seem to drag on forever. Besides the first song on the CD, nothing is here but the lyrics. Try something else, such as Yellowcard. Great lyrics and music. Buy that instead."
2,Grrrrr,"Man I'm sick of all these Creed/Nickelback/3 Doors Down/Staind type bands. Their all so boring and generic and plain, how can anybody like this crap? Meant To Live was an okay song- not a great song, just okay, that is until it got extremely overplayed on the radio..."
5,Drummingsheep,I did not think Switchffoot would be able to top the other albums. But have proven me and alot of other people wrong .This album is defintely a must for every music lover it rocks.It has a good blend between the other albums. the new versionof dare you to move it really cool it sounds like what it wouldplayed live. The beautiful letdown should be in you collection now what are you waiting for!
5,I LIKE SWITCHFOOT!!!,i just have to say that Switchfoot rocks and their latest album is my favorite ever. Rock on guys!!!
4,Doesn't spend much time in my player...,"I tend to rate music by how much I play it. Interestingly, though this is probably my third favorite cd in my collection, it doesn't find my stereo very often for some reason. Hence, only four stars. However, I still highly recommend it, as the songs are solid and there isn't a single 'bad' song on the disc."
5,Awesome,"This CD is one of the best I have. Not only is it an all together amazing CD, but mine was given to me by my cousin shortly before she died. People constantly ask to borrow it because they've heard it's really good. Which it is. Buy it, you won't regret it!!!"
4,I like this CD,I really like Swichfoot is a good CD like seeing Artist doing Christian Music our world is fallen and needs a Savior!
3,eh,"the singer has a great voice, very cool and unique. there are some stand out tracks (meant to live, dare you to move) but, this record is very self concious, rather uninspired, and kind of lame at times. you might like it if youre a young kid."
2,oops,"I was really disapointed with this CD. I bought it because I really liked the first song and expected more songs to be like it, I was wrong."
5,This CD is GREAT!,"I think this is by far the best CD Switchfoot has ever put out. People say they are selling out, but if you listen to ""More then fine"" You hear Jon say ""I'm not selling out"" So there you go. I think the remix of ""Dare you to move"" Is AWSOME! The guitar part is loger and better. ""Adding to the noise"" ""Ammunition"" ""Redemption"" and all the other songs are great! I 'dare you to move' and go buy this CD!"
2,I Don't Get It,I read all these great reviews but my photo output doesn't come any where near professional developing or what I see on my computer. Most all my photos are washed out even if I use photo editing software to make adjustments prior to printing them. I've been using both the Canon Paper and Kodak's Premium paper. Can someone make some reccomendations on the exact printer settings on the S800 that results in the best color match to what I'm seeing on the computer? I consider my self very technical but I can't seem to figure out the best mix of settings.
3,You get what you pay for,"Bought it new for 300 on ebay, it did work well when it worked but unfortunatly, it did not always work. There would be times when it just would not turn on. Never had any problems with getting support from Magellan, but they did not know what to do either. Slow to find signal but good in holding it and recalculating when missed exit. Again, you get what you pay for and this unit is certaily not woth more then $300."
5,Flawless,"This Road Gadget is a TRUE performer and a steal for tha price compared to other GPS systems...Once this thing INITIALLY locks onto a spacelite (10 to 15 mins),,u are free to roam and hang your hat at any address u wanna go..'cause it's not letting go of the signal 98% of the time (nothing is perfect)..All following satalite lockups takes seconds...I'm a regional roamer ,so this is a great mate for me in tha GA & FLA area..It's good to know I have Detailed maps of tha U.S on Cdrom & CPU in case I wanna go Cross Country...I'm good with Ga,,Fla for now.Magellan 300 is a flawless steal of a deal.."
3,Not a huge fan of this GPS.,"Although we have used this GPS frequently, you can't delete any of the prior locations that you visit. It doesn't have really user friendly options, bigger and better GPS's have come out and we now own a Tom Tom."
2,Buyer Beware,This item works great. It is just obsolete. The maps are outdated and will not be updated by Magellan so if you live in a growing city like me your maps will not reflect any changes and there is no way to change it. Other than that the price is great and it works good with its limited capabilities.
3,Definitely not anywhere near as good as the movie,"The movie was absolutely great, I have no idea how the makers of the film got such a great story out a trashy novel like this, but thank god they did.I was one of those who saw the movie first, then got the novel out of interest. I was severely disappointed. It's just horrible.You'll definitely have to see the movie again, to get the bad taste this novel leaves, out of your mouth."
2,"Read this a long time ago, but remember my feelings well","This remains the only book I have ever read that is worse than the movie. The adventures were less believable (albeit, his life in the movie is pretty out there too!) and the book, surprisingly, doesn't allow the reader to love Forrest as much as the movie does."
4,"Read the book, avoid the movie.","This book is a hoot. Groom does a wonderful job of crafting a story that fits the Southern literary tradition of the anti-hero to a T. Is Forrest really an idiot, or are those around him? How does society and its fixation with the superficial shape us and the direction we take? Can we achieve anything when motivated by a simple, nonjudgemental love? The film captured none of Forrest's complexities, relying instead on our fascination with our own pop culture to generate interest."
4,He isn't a really idiot,"Anyone thinks he is an idiot.Many funny things happened to him.He were a football player,a soldier,a hoarmonica player,a spaceman,a shrimp business boss,even a father.He never gives up all his life.He can make his friend's(Bubba)dream come true."
1,Beware of false advertising,"I purchased this item because it claimed to fit all Cuisinart Blenders. My Blender is less than a year old and when my son shredded the gasket in the garbage disposal I went looking for the fastest most convenient way to replace it. This isn't it. The gasket was delivered promptly, but since it didn't fit my blender I had to contact Cuisinart anyway for the replacement. Save yourself time and trouble and just go direct."
1,Stinks. Doesn't work.,"As recommended, I used very little of this. The smell is horrible and has not dissipated. I was also sweating through my shirt within an hour of application.Ugh."
3,Spreads unevenly,"I've had mine for a few months now and used it at least 3 times. Mine also spreads more to the left than to the right, even with the edgeguard off. I thought maybe I was imagining it until I read these other posts. I do like the edgeguard feature, however. Maybe I'll turn it upside down and see if I can do anything to rectify this; it's got to have something to do with the edgeguard disc. Wouldn't buy it again.Also, it's kind of annoying when you buy a non-Scotts granular lawn product, and they don't tell you the settings for this spreader. I never know what to set the dial to."
1,Plastic gears are not built to last,"I used this twice and then the gear box came apart;if I could give this a < one star I would. If Scotts (IMHO) wants a reputation as a reliable company, then they should sell reliable items. This is not a reliable machine. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money and buy a speader with an exposed METAL gear and decent tires. I didn't, and I will now have to pay the extra $$$ for a good spreader, on top of what I paid for this one. Scotts needs to walk down to their engineering/R&D department and clean house."
2,Do not buy this software,This software program makes the incredibly easy seem so difficult. It takes 4 or 5 steps to save pictures to the gallery (or at least I thought...my pictures were not there the next time I checked). The software has given me lots of trouble recognizing my digital camera. It is cumbersome in every aspect. Thank goodness Microsoft offers a 30 day money back guaranty on thier products....
3,Primary documents for a critical year,"Volume IX of the First Series of the Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939, edited by Rohan Butler and JPT Bury, covers German affairs in the first half of 1920. This is a period when the Versailles Treaty first came officially into effect, and was marked as well by the (failed) Kapp Putsch, uprisings in other parts of Germany, and the occupation of the Rhineland.The British were very involved in, or very close observers of, all of this, and this volume includes the memoranda, telegrams, and other documents the Foreign Office produced on German affairs during that time. It's not necessarily fascinating reading in and of itself, obviously, but this and the other volumes in the DBFP series are invaluable primary sources for diplomatic and military historians, and useful additions to specialized libraries or bookshelves."
1,Great Movie but Buyer Beware,"I was dumb enough to order the DVD copy of this movie from a seller in NY (just like the one selling it now) who is no longer listed on Amazon.com as a seller. What I did not notice of the write up was that it said it was a quality of 7-out-of-10 copy of the movie from a VHS tape. I was not pleased with this but I did miss it and let that go as a learning experiance. When the DVD copy came in an unmarked package with no return address I begain to worry as to what I really got. Turns out it was a copy of the correct movie but it was more of a quality of 3-out-of-10 and a length of 7-out-of-10. Yes length, the last 20 minutes of the movie was missing.I could be wrong but I thought it was illegal to copy and distribute copys of copyrighted materal. So be careful where you order items and make sure you scroll to the bottom to read ALL of the fine print."
4,Mostly hits it's mark,"I am another Python fan. I regrettably, watched Jabberwocky the other day and was not that thrilled. But, a few days later, Yellowbeard arrives in the mail. Lets just say, if you are just getting into Python films, know this, just a few of the best of the best:Holy GrailMeaning of lifeLife of BrianBad:JabberwockyIn it's own class:YellowbeardThis is why. Think of taking 4 of the best comic groups of the time and getting them together in one movie. The Pythons, Spike Milligan, Cheech and Chong, and select actors from Mel Brooks films. It's a recipe for fun. Although it does miss it's mark on some occaisions, and some of the jokes seem to be regurgitated from other films, it is a funny movie with redeeming qualities.For a true Python fan, you will enjoy it. For someone new to Python, it will be touch and go.This copy/edition has NO special features. Just so you know."
3,Fun parody of Pirate genre,"Some of the wackos from Monty Python pulled in a bunch of their friends for a fun jaunt to mexico.Oh yeah and make a costume comedy too. Treasure Island filtered through Python.You can see them all having a blast doing it.Great cast of comedy pros from that time.Including the last performance from rubber faced Marty Feldman,who sadly died at the end of filming.Several great character actors playing against type too,not what you would expect from several of them.But just what you might expect from Python.Not for the young kids though, this is grown up black humor.I hadn't seen it in 10+ years, but it drew me back,and it stood up pretty well. I can see Johnny Depp giving ita few nods in the Pirates of The Caribean films.This is the original send up of the genre for me."
2,This is more of a renter,"I bought this movie, due to the raving reviews, but I just wasn't that impressed with it, I would suggest renting this before buying it. It has a great allstar line up ,but I just wasn't all that impressed, hence the two stars."
2,Monty Python meets crap,"I must say that I was astonished when I looked at the other reviews for this movie.It was truly horrible.A complete waste of talent.Maybe some fans of Monty Python will want this,but for me it would strictly be for collection,not entertainment.I really do like other Monty Python movies,but this absolutly stunk!But then again so many people wrote good reviews,that this review proboly won't make a difference.For good comedy refer to Monty Python and the Holy Grail,and the other Monty Python movies,but not this.Oh there may be a couple momments that are alright with John Cleese,but the rest is no good!"
5,"Comedy, DVD",A Xmas gift for my daughter. Monty Python meets Cheech & Chong. It will be our daughter's 1st time seeing this movie- she should love it.
4,Well made Drama on the Rights of Woman.,"When a tough DA Lawyer (Kelly McGillis) takes a case from a Victim (Jodie Foster in a Oscar Winning role), who was gang raped and the situation gets worse, when they have almost no evidence to convict them.Directed by Jonathan Kaplan (Bad Girls) has made a strong drama. Great Performances by McGillis and Foster. This film was a Box Office Hit. This is a Superb, Emotionally Intense, which in fact was Based on a True Story. This film will be put off by some of it viewers. This is a Extremely Well Made Film. Grade:A-."
3,should i get it?,i don't own a lot of the stuff on the cd but from redaing reviews here it seems like the best is missin...I bought Mint Royales's album and was glad i did...Would it be better to buy Looper as an album or pick up this soundtrack?Some feedback would be great...
3,What is the name of that song?,It's killing me! What is the name of that song that is playing when he's in the empty Times Square? The one that sounds like a mandolin playing with the funky beat?
5,don't just be a tourist - indulge,"Although this soundtrack (as well as the Royal Tennenbaums and others) are amazing, please don't just settle for clips from these great artists. Go out and get some Rolling Stones, Looper, REM, Bob Dylan, Ramones... anything you like from them - I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed with the rest of their work. Believe me, coming from personal experience, if you just swim through convenient music collections without diving in, you'll never fully know or love what you are hearing."
3,WHAT IS THE INSTRUMENTAL BACKGROUND FROM DVD MENU?...,"...the commentary refers to it as ""Garage Beat"", and it's also played while a ski-capped Cruise secretly follows Cruz in the Village... (the songs reminds me of ""Aquarius"" by The Boards Of Canada)...Can anyone help???"
3,I wish the album had been more extensive,"I recently saw the film, and I loved the soundtrack. However, when I heard the soundtrack album, I was kind of upset about the fact that only a small portion of the film's awesome soundtrack was being offered on the album. The songs on the album itself are great, especially the club tracks. By the way, I read Alex Von Roach's review, and I would like it if he could send me the list of all 41 songs from the film. I would really appreciate it."
3,"Please post those elusive, absent songs!","Rather than a review, this is a coercive, pleading statement. Could someone, I know one person did mention having the entire list, please post or direct people to where we might find the artists and titles featured in Cameron Crowe's most recent shenanigan? I think everyone would be extremely appreciative. Thank you . . . in advance."
3,music fan,"Wanted to mention that I was dissapointed that they omitted the Thievory Corporation song from the sound track. ""Lebonese Blonde"" was the song another reviewer asked about, playing in the beginning of the club scene."
4,A MUST BUY!!!!!!!,"WoW! This has definetly been the best one out YET. I have been a flightsim enthusiest for quit some time now and this sim tops the lot.The frame rates are great but depends what type of computer you have. There are some false descriptions of what type of system is needed to run this program and the manual does not give a large aspect off the game.The graphics are excellent and are definetely the best out at the moment. Game play is overall great, the flight dynamics are really not any better than FS2000 except for the 747-400&Caravan.Another great aspect of the program is the ATC chater.At last you are not alone in the skys. Microsoft have done great on developing this function wich is very easy to use and understandable.(you would definetly have a ball with it)My advice for those Flightsim enthusiest who are wondering if it is worth buying, if you have a fast computer with alot of space on your hard-drive, besides frame rates, FS2002 is definetely WORTH A BUY!"
3,"It's a game, not a flight simulator","I bought because I am a student pilot. My comments are only about the C172 and C182 because these are the only aircraft I have real life experience with. I do not feel these aircraft behave in a completely realistic manner, especially regarding trim, p-factor, coordinated turns, and taxiing. I also bought a CH yoke and pedals. The pedals are handy on the ground but nearly useless in the air and aren't really worth having. The OnTop demo which came w/my CH yoke seems more faithful to the aircraft, and I intend to buy a copy. MS FlightSim isn't all bad. There is an astonishing amount of visual detail and it did help practicing my radio navigation. My point is merely that it is a game first and not really a training system."
1,Amusingly Simplistic,"i find much of the book's central argument to be absurd. i am left wondering if any research or thought has gone into it at all. neither drug dealing nor drug use is a victomless crime. ever seen a mother abandon her children in favor of coke? it ain't pretty and it is very much the business, not only of myself, but of all Americain citizins. if rich white people want to play revolutionary i suggest volunteering their time at a rehab center."
4,Stephen Brodsky is awesome,"This album really shows how talented Brodsky is, he plays all the instruments by himself and I would say he did a damn good job on this album. I gave this album 4 stars because his work is awesome and I've always been a big fan of his band Cave In which is a hardcore band and is my favorite band. So go out and get this album and if you're one of those Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit followers I suggest you go get a Cave In album and you'll realize you've been blinded by those junk bands all along."
5,#1 R&B Group in the Biz Today,"This is the best R&B group to come out since Jodeci, way back when. This CD is excellent from start to finish, my only wish is that it was longer. ""I Gotta Be"" is one of the best R&B jams of all time. Everybody go get the new album ""Heartbreak""......."
2,I think that I will stick to recommendations from friends!,"I left a review of this book earlier and wanted to add some more info for those who are considering going to any of the people mentioned in the book. Of the people I saw: Einstein, Clarke, Saulter, Karter, McInearney and Andrews, the only one that I can recommend with any confidence is Frank Andrews. I was most disappointed with the others above.If you want details go to Frank Andrews, he, unlike the others, knows his stuff."
2,Disappointed so far,"I have been to 3 people (papapetros, Purpora, & Van Dermeir so far and they were very disappointing, one of them could tell me nothing but kept pressing me for information instead. It was a complete deadend and I am not a skeptic. Others have been proved completely wrong now that all the time frame predictions are over."
3,Disappointment,"I gather, from reading the other reviews of this latest Stephanie Plum novel, that I am in the minority. But I felt the book was definitely not up to Janet Evanovich's standards. It lacke the wit and cleverness that her earlier books have. When reading her earlier novels, I would sit and laugh my rear end off, throughout the book. But ""To The Nines"" gave me a few snickers, at best. I hate to say it, because, like so many others, I have waited eagerly for the next Stephanie Plum novel, and will await her next one next summer, but I wonder if Ms. Evanovich is finally coming upon her personal brick wall? I hope not, and I sincerely hope that she regains her form, but this book was a disappointment."
4,So funny,"Love Janet Evanovich, her books are hilarious. Albert Kloughn is such an endearing addition to her character family. Lula on Atkins? Love it!This series get a little formulaic after a while, though."
1,Very disappointed,"I can't believe I waited a year for this book with such great anticipation. I hope the author is not getting in the mode of ""mass marketing"", publishing anything just to get it out there knowing the character will ""sell itself"". Sure, it was funny in parts, Lula carried this book. No substance, a huge disappointment."
5,Best of the Bunch,"Out of all of the Plum novels, I would have to say that this one is my favorite. Lola on atkins, girls trip to vegas, and Steph with Ranger's ""Merry Men"" make this one of the funniest of the series."
2,"Still funny, but getting tiring","I enjoy her writing because I find her novels to be very funny. However, I'm really getting tired of the same old thing. Same characters with the same issues. How long does a running joke have to last? How many ways can you crack on Vinnie's sexual 'preferences'? How many ways can you blow up a car? How many times do you have to be in danger before you take the gun out of the cookie jar? The formula is good, but it's getting old."
1,jumped the shark,"i really enjoyed the first eight books, but for me this one sent the series sailing over the fin. i couldn't even finish it. even though i enjoy the books' characters, i particularly can't stand joe morelli, and his prominence in this one really set my teeth on edge. it's a shame, because no one's made me laugh out loud like janet evanovich."
5,Addicted to Plum,"Someone left a couple of these Stephanie Plum novels at my work and I immediately became addicted to this series. I had to go back and read all the ones I didn't get to read for free. I love the storylines, they are highly entertaining and so good I can hardly put them down till I'm finished."
4,Another Great unbeleivable Stephanie Story!!,I won't write a long review just mentioned that for Stephanie Plum lovers this is another success and I am lucky she didn't live in my neighborhood!!Thanks to the author!
5,Very funny and addicting!!,"I LOVE all the Stephanie Plum novels. They have wonderful, funny, lovable and sexy characters. I have read all 9 of her novels from this series twice. I can't wait for #10 in June to come out. I have to say it's the best book I EVER read!!"
5,"Good Laughs, Solid Episode","I marvel at Evanovich's achievement: A collection of characters and dynamics that are stable enough to make us comfortable, and variable enough to keep us entertained. Stephanie lovers (like me!) will find this to be an entirely acceptable instalment in the series. She doesn't blow up any cars or make it to Stiva's this time, but there is plenty of Ranger, Morelli, and a little more Connie than usual.This incarnation had several good laughs, which I think I appreciate more than ever these days.I'm issuing five stars because it is exactly what it is supposed to be: a dumb serial that made me laugh some and turn pages and get interested in another world for a while. If you're seeking fine literature, you can look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a good Stephanie Plum tale, you will find it here."
5,Janet Evanovich - To the Nines (Stephanie Plum series),"The Stephanie Plum series is great! A great series if you like action and mystery! Some series fall flat after the first few books, but not this one. This series continually references the old characters, introduces new characters, and keeps the story line fresh and interesting with Stephanie Plum's professional and personal life. To sum it up, the series is very interesting, never boring!"
5,Not for dog-fighters. It is for pilots.,"With patches and add-ons, this game can take you to ""great heights"" and gives you beatiful views. it is resource intensive, so check you computer config with the minimum requirements. otherwise you will be seeing frame progressions and long load times. also you need a joystick to enjoy this game to the fullest.buy this if you are interested in learning how to fly (the terminologies and techniques). if you are looking for something like F22 of F18 dog-fights, this game just dosent have that speed and crash realisms."
1,Used/Defective Product,"The MS Flight Simulator 2002 Standard item received was sent by a private customer,although it was advertised as new and would be sent through an Amazon.com affiliate.Although the game is playable, the sound is very poor quality and has many skips.I purchased this game because it required only a CD-ROM to install instead of aDVD-ROM. Game is too old and I would not recommend it ! I should have known thatthe price paid was far too cheap for a new, usable game."
3,"Beautiful, sleek, possibly not study enough","I ordered this paper towel holder so we could mount it below our kitchen cabinets to clear up counter space. When it arrived, I LOVED it's look, but my husband said he didn't think it looked sturdy enough to hold paper towels being pulled in a less-that-careful manner. I returned the item and bought the simplehuman 13x2.75 Wall Mount Paper Towel Holder, Stainless Steel and Black. It's not quite as sleek to me, but it's under the cabinet so I don't really care."
2,"Waiting for it to ""Grow"" on me","What can I say?? I went against my ""3-song"" rule before buying this CD and I must say I am truly disappointed. In a nut shell...too many slow songs...and not enough substance.... I wasn't expecting her to do another Mountain High Valley Low...I expected MUCH MORE. I know sometimes a CD has to ""grow on you""....I am still waiting for that to happen. I just don't get it. Don't get me wrong, I like inspirational songs ...but these songs didn't minister to me. The best thing I can do is give it away to somebody else. I think the best cut is ""I'm Thankful"". I also like the cut w/ Karen Clark-Sheard. When is her new stuff coming out anyways?? I also like Thank You"". Other than that..the ""fillers"" in between are easy to skip over...and that is exactly what I usually do...Maybe the ""Live"" version will be better...In the future I will stick to my 3-song rule....."
4,Great new project,"These days I have to admit that I have to listen to a gospel cd about 3 times before I can get the feel of it. The music is mildly contemporary and not ""way out there"" like a lot of the newer gospel artists. Every since I have began listening to Yolanda's music, she has had her own special uniqueness like CeCe Winans. I would recommend buying this CD. It is worth it."
5,BEST CD IVE EVER HEARD,"IF YOU ARE A BELEIVER OR NON-BELEIVER THIS CD WILL DO SOME THINGS TO YOU! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD. THE INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGES THAT LIE BEYOND WHAT YOU HEAR ARE GREAT. I TAKE THIS CD EVERYWHERE I GO, AND PLAY IT. MRS. ADAMS REALLY OUT DID HJERSELF WITH THIS ONE. BELIEVE WILL MAKE YOU BELEIVE."
5,"A gem, Svelte !",One of the pinnacles of chinky-ckinky guitar meets bass. A beautiful balance between rhythm and aching blues lyrics. Scotland was invented for Love and Money and The Blue Nile. Dogs in Traffic their other album is equally exceptional
5,A Memorable Performence!!!,"Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble's performence at Carnegie Hall is great including the Roomful Of Blues Horns, Jimmie Vaughan, Dr. John, and Angela Strhili who has a great renedition with Stevie Ray Vaughan. Their are alot of great blues tunes including C.O.D. with Angela Strhili WOW!! I also like the live version of Scuttle Buttin', and Honey Bee. Their is also a different rendition of Pride And Joy with the Roomful Of Blues Horns that sounds really good with Horns. Their is also a really great performence of Lenny that I just think is great compared to the live performence at ElMocambo! Im sure everyone would appreciate this live recording at the one and only carnegie hall. Enjoy!"
3,"Good for brainstorming, but...","My wife Jennifer and I (Jason, believe it or not) received this book as a sort of gag gift. Initially, we found it useful for naming our baby. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the book does not include much in the way or origins or meanings, if that is important to you. Also, the book seems to spend as much time detailing ""bad"" and ""old"" names as it does suggesting new, fresh ones. We also found quite a bit of repetition between the authors' various categories. Overall, we found the book useful and amusing at first, but I'm not sure it helped us to finalize our baby's name. If you are looking for a ""traditional"" or ""conservative"" name, this may not be the book for you. But if you want to go off the beaten path, I would think that this would be a good place to start..."
4,Well made!,"If it's Motorola, you can trust on the quality. I have bought 4 pairs already and I'm satisfied.But I had some reception problems on a big building of several floors.Anyway, I recommend it."
3,"DON'T ""PAYOLA"" TOO MUCH FOR THIS ONE","Payolas fans can definitely get their music fix with this one. This concert DVD is from a show recorded on October 15/1982 at the Concert Hall in Toronto, Canada. The picture and sound are pretty good considering the age of the material used and the technology from the 1980's.The picture can be dark and grainy at times and even though the sound is in digital 5.1 it's a bit weak. Some hissing and background noise can also be heard throughout the show, but not enough to ruin the performance. The Payolas were one of my favorite bands of the 80's. I'm familiar with all their songs, but I really only bought this to see ""Eyes of a Stranger"" played live.DVD Songlist:1. Soldier2. Dancing With Another3. Jukebox4. China Boys5. Hastings Street6.

People Who Have Great LivesBonus Features:- Interview With Paul and BobTotal Running Time: 68 MinsDolby 5.1 / Stereo"
5,Great Movie!,"I howled throughout this movie, in between singing along with these great numbers. This is the musical for people, like myself, who HATE musicals!I bought this PAL-formatted dvd with the intent of converting it to all-region and then converting to iPad format. The result was spectacular!"
5,Old Time Favorite,This is one of my all time favorite movies. I always watched it on TV and now I can watch it every time I feel like it.
2,Clint Eastwood sings in this one (Lee Marvin too),"I'm a BIG fan of Clint Eastwood, and I like the old west (and gold rush) type movies --- but this is just NOT one of the better ones. However Clint is handsome in this, and if you're curious he also sings a song or two in this. (But you don't have to watch the movie to hear that, you can catch him on YouTube [...]There are may other Eastwood movies out there...you're better off picking another movie (unless you want to put something on to fall asleep to)."
1,pirated,"I tried to do the right thing by purchassing the movie for my dad , instead of renting it and burning it. well ended up getting a prireted copy anyways and for that I will not buy from amazon again. they should do more screening to prevent this:("
1,Clint Estwood should not sing in a musical ever,"Bad story line, bad lyrics and clint estwood's bad sounding voice just does not come to a good mix.This movie is not even worth being for free.Thankfully I have watched this using the primevideo of Amazon so that I now know not to ever include this in my video libraries of the future -- some things are ok to allow to fade into historic bliss."
3,What's Wrong With This Picture,"Take two of the screen's greatest tough guys -- Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood -- combine them in a big budget film and what have you got? A DAMNED MUSICAL!!! Harve Presnall was originally offered the Pardner role but turned it down for a smaller part and the Song ""They Call the Wind Moria"". A young and very beautiful Jean Seberg -- a few years before her tragic suicide -- great outdoor scenery and a pleasant film. It's not great but it isn't as bad as some have made out."
4,The late great Lee Marvin,"Probably best known as a 'tough guy' in films, some of Marvin's greatest moments were comedic. He is hilarious in this musical, as he was in Cat Ballou with Jane Fonda. The music is fantastic. Seberg is beautiful. And you even get to hear a very young Eastwood sing. If it were not for the obvious, overall theme of prostitution, widespread drunkenness, and immoral relationships, I would even let my grandchildren watch."
1,A great film,"This is a GREAT film with a stellar cast ,performances & wonderful music. It is too bad, however, that the format of this particular DVD is in the European format & therefore incompatible with American DVD players. I wanted this wonderful film as part of my film collection, but had to return it since it was not playable on a DVD player in the USA."
1,not playable here,I was extremely disappointed in this product. I tried to watch it & it says it cannot be played in this region. Evidently it is only for sale overseas? So I am left with something I can't reven return because it is opened.
1,Doesn't even play,I ordered this movie while my husband was away on deployment as a late Christmas present to give him when he got home. Sometime about a week after we got home we tried to play it and it just didn't work at all. In all fairness I forgot to contact the seller to ask about replacement but still it should have just worked in the first place.
2,Paint,"Never got to see it. The DVD was a region 2. Which most American DVD machine will not play. A word to the wise if the DVD is rated region 2, don't buy it, you'll be sorry."
1,Very unhappy with this seller. Beware!,"Didn't get my money back and I was misled that this video that was sold in the USA and shipped to the USA was a video that I could use on my DVD player. Region 2 is europe for any of you that might purchase from this seller and assume he is on the up and up. He's good to post ""REGION 2"" very plainly. What's wrong with EUROPE ONLY? I know! You don't need a translater for that - at least if you live in the USA and want a DVD for a US DVD player. To top all of that off this seller wouldn't answer my email and I had to go through Amazon to get any response at all. I want a negative star rating for this seller. Not even worth a 1 star."
2,"Why, God?","I understand a lot of you like this movie. I cannot say the same. Never much for musicals, and always big on Eastwood westerns- I nearly vomited when I saw this. Two of the coolest actors to ever star in a Western- together...singing?! I love Lee MArvin and Eastwood, but this movie was rediculous. I enjoyed the plot, sort of...it was just the absolute wrong movie for these guys. I hear who's in it, and I expect Hang 'Em High or High Plains Drifter, and an Ennio Morricone score. I got this instead. As you can see, I'd be dissapointed. It was even worse to see what everyone thinks is a joke from the Simpsons, is a real movie. Thumbs way down on this one. If you're into musicals, you might like it- if you're a movie person, don't subject yourself to this."
1,Paint Your Wagon - DVD,"Well, the DVD didn't work AT ALL in my player. I'm told that there's a difference in American DVD players and English DVD players. Had I known this before I wouldn't have ordered it. Anyway, I really can't give a review. I'll keep looking for a DVD that comes from someplace in the States. It didn't cost that much so I'm not going to bother to send it back."
4,An Eastwood Classic,"I purchased this movie for my mother for Christmas. She's been saying for years that she wanted it, and of course, now its out of print. I had to watch the movie since I purchased it used. The movie was an interesting combination of a musical and western that kept me entertained throughout. I also love some of the clothing in the movie, definately 1969."
4,Pretty Good,Ok the movie was great.If you liked the music in the movie you will love the soundtrack !! If you buy When in Rome soundtrack you should get our lips are sealed soundtrack to !
3,Five strar,the shaver only works when you shave with the .t. outline clippers then you apply it otherwise it would not get the hair out. if you do that then it would work fine
5,Excellent product,This is the second of these I have owned. The first one was broken while I was traveling. It shaves very close with no problems. I use it to shave my face and head. I would highly recommend this product.
3,not the best deal for your money,"This shaver is OK, but the one with the liner is better, you cant outline your mustache etc. with this one, bad buy"
5,Excellent product.,This is a replacement for my first shaver shaper. The only drawback is the product does not provide the shaper at the back of the shaver; at least the replacement I have does not.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"They put all this stuff about how you have to give it weeks...LIES! This thing just dried my face out and gave one of the worst shaves ever! I bought it because my barber recommended it as a way to keep my head bald but it gave poor results their as well. Basically, don't waste your money or time. It costs too much to work so poorly on my face/head."
5,It really works!!,After years of skin irritation was a little skeptical that this would work.So far no bumps. The shaver is not razor smooth yet gives a close shaved look.Goodbye beard!!!
1,Sorry Whal Professional Rechargeable Shaver Shaper,"Hello, This is one of the most sorry and bad shavers I ever bought in my life timeI have never used a shaver that will not even cut my facial hair if it is long or shortI would like to know if there is any way that I can get my money back for this sorryass shaver and I will never purchase any Wahl products never again in my life time.I have never been so disgusted and not pleased with any other shaver that I have ever purchasedas with this product.Disgusted and Very Unhappy"
2,This is a poor replacement for my Remington ES-1000 Ultra Smooth slot electric razor,"This is a poor replacement for my Remington ES-1000 Ultra Smooth slot electric razor which is discontinued. I'm white but my facial hair tends to curl right back into my skin. I'm not looking for a close shave because of ingrown hairs,however this Wahl shaver misses so many hairs I have to use a trimmer prior to using it. I suspect instead of the hair going into slots to be cut(like my remington) it has to pass thru the mesh holes on the Wahl. I used my Remington for years without missing random hairs and at a quarter of the time it takes to use this Wahl with no ingrown hairs. Remington please bring the slot razor back."
3,GOOD MEMORIES,"THE MUSIC IS GOOD, BUT THE CASE CAME SCRATCH AND CRACK.I think that the people who shipped the items must have more carefull,and if the case comes broken from the manufacturer, please change it, donot send it to the customer."
4,Interesting story of 1930's Spokane,"Timothy Egan's a good storyteller. The book held my interest and was hard to put down. This is one of his earlier books (1994), and he grows as an author in his subsequent works. IMO ""The Worst Hard Time"" (2006) and especially ""The Big Burn"" (2009) are more coherent. I found ""Breaking Blue"" to be a bit scattered, the focus changing ADD-like sometimes. Since the book is based on a true story, I would've also liked an index and photos. Good book, though - I'd recommend it."
3,Room for improvement,"This series has the best batter-pitcher interface, and graphics, but that's about all. The defense and base-running are terrible! It's pretty easy to use a conservative swing and go the other way, but the way the ball reacts after being hit is not good. These guys should team up with High Heat Baseball and make a game together. High Heat has a similar interface for the pitcher and batter, but playing against the computer is no fun. I've been playing baseball games since the original RBI, which is still the best American released baseball game ever. I've owned and played at least 25 different bsaeball games. I own a Japanese game called World Stadium 4, which is by far the best I've played. The graphics are cartoon like, but the gameplay is awesome. If the American makers want to improve their games rather than just adding new rosters, the should check out the World Stadium series which I think evolved from RBI baseball."
3,Triple Play 2000 with the new rosters...,1) No injury. 2) All points are earned to the pitcher. 3) Too many errors. 4) Unrealistic rosters (ex: 15 pitchers with the Expos). 5) Stupid play-by-play. 6) Too many foul balls.
3,"This game is on the edge of fake, or real","This game does have quite good graphics, and does have easy gameplay. But what it does'nt have, is the realeness of real baseball. Like hitting a homerun often results in a rocket sound. And sliding sounds like a gun shot. Most people will enjoy this game. But if your looking for a game to have fun keeping stats, and playing a season, I recomend waiting for wsb2k for dc, or all-star baseball for 64"
2,More flaws than an old pinto!,"What a terrible game this is. Only very young kids will enjoy the ""extras"" which are ridiculous. Besides the terrible fielder animations the game has a few bugs as well. )I hit a home run and the ball fell back into play, but the computer wouldnt field it so i had to reset the game) also the close ups of fielders are terrible, it always looks like your player is throwing home, even though he might be throwing to second! In addition.....rey ordonez has hit 4 homeruns in 2 games for me (on pro mode)In conclusion, this is pretty much the same as last year (except for the horrible extra features such as having a home run derby in a livving room) the only really good thing about the game is being able to use hall of fame players, but the game play is very unrealisitc, and im sick of these monsterous polygonal graphics....why cant these developers stay away from those ugly close ups forever....(or at least until PS2 is out)"
1,(not a kid just dont have an account),"he is the fatest piece of crap ive ever seen! his music sux so much! turn the freakin mic off! the mic is off! he is the biggest wanksta fo eva and eva! check these peps out - mike jones, tupac, snoop dogg and nwa (none of those guys weigh 500 pounds)"
1,Hip-Hop at it's worst!,"This is Fat Joe's worst album and wind up being his best selling. Compare this album to his first two and you can tell the difference. Man, I really miss real hip-hop."
4,The Big Man is Back; One of the Year's best,"Fat Joe is back with the album JOSE and he is beautifully repping on this album. King of New York is a tight song with great production. The tighest cuts on the album are Murda Rap, He's Not real, My lifestyle and It's okay. It's Okay has a nice storyline but it is too close to B.I.G's ""Warning"" but the beat and rap flow still makes it hot. Pick this CD Now because it is hot. One."
4,"Simple, easy to read, helpful","I'm a fan of Alfa Romeo, though I've never owned one. Maybe that's why I like the car so much! Anyway, this book is helpful for novices like me. It sorts through the dizzying array of Alfa terms, models, years, equipment, etc. No, it's not perfect, far from it. But it's a big help at getting the basics."
5,I'm falling in love with France,"I can't speak French but I love the music and the words. I've been listening to French music now for about a year. Garou is the best, this CD is great, there is one song that hurts my ears ""Hey Jude"". I really thought that would be a lot different but they took it to a completely different level. Sort of like hearing someone here destroy the Star Spangle Banner."
3,Big Collapse CD,"Well, I got this album for free since big collapse's guitarist Matt Kane is my older brother and he gave it to my dad. Overall it's a pretty good album. From the lyrics to the rythm section (drums and bass) they brought in their music to NYC for their first album. the strong points I'd say is probably figured you out (that aired on a radio station back in NYC) and 1981 with it's awesome guitar parts. If you're in to all different types of rock music I'd reccommend this album to you."
2,Rave MP Amp128 - STINKS!,"I bought this unit because of the great portability, good looks, and low price. Unfortunately, the performance has been lousy. It frequently refuses to ""boot-up,"" and I have to remove the battery constantly to get it to reset itself. Also, the LCD screen keeps going out - coming back on - then dying again.I'm a Mac user and had counted on this player being compatible, but it's really not! You can't drag and drop files to the player like you're supposed to be able to do. I have to open Disk Utility and do a complete Erase of the internal memory (make sure you choose MS-DOS format), then drag files back on to the player. This is a huge inconvenience."
1,Please don't buy this,"It does not meet even your minimum expectations. The player keeps ""hanging"" for no reason. And the only way to make it work again is to remove the battery and insert it again. It always starts from the first song in memory, not from where you stopped it previously. Even if you stop the player for just a second, you have to listen from the first song later! The menu is awful. You have to do quite some research to get familiar to it. The battery lasts for 1 hr only. So need to invest in rechargeable ones.Plus points: Sound quality is good and you can upgrade the player's memory by adding an additional smart memory module."
2,"Delicious, leaves aftertaste, caused MSG headache","These crackers taste absolutely delicious, but leave a coating/aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for a long time. Also, they contain MSG and for some people (I'm one of them) it causes a headache. The last time I binged on these crackers (and they are hard to put down!), I ended up with a crashing headache. Be forewarned!"
5,Methodical and thorough,"A methodical and thorough guide to improving your public speaking. The author covers all major aspects of the craft: writing (and thinking about what you want to say), preparation, diction, awareness of the surroundings, use of humour, length, and many other factors which ultimately add up to a successful delivery of a speech. The author is a former speechwriter for the US president Lyndon B. Johnson, hence not surprisingly, many of the stories and tips offered by the author have a political flavor - don't let that deter you, it is an excellent book.For a more technically minded crowd, also make sure to check out ""Confessions of a Public Speaker"" by Scott Berkun."
4,Compelling Romance,"It would be easy to dismiss ""The Lover"" as mere erotica. For sure the love scenes are a selling point here. That said, they are some of the most gorgeously framed love scenes ever transferred to celluloid. I defy anyone, man or woman, not to feel their heart race after viewing these scenes. It also doesn't hurt that Jane March and Tony Leong have a kinetic chemistry that makes you believe in their love. There is also stunning production design on hand here. Director Jean Jacques Annaud also has some compelling things to say about racism, classism, and colonialism. ""The Lover"" will leave you mesmerized."
5,Excellent cinematographic interpretation of Duras' novel,"This is a movie that can be seen many times, both due to the beauty of its cinematography and its many layers of meaning. The film manages to capture the flow of Duras' prose. In some ways, it is even more beautiful and subtle. March and Leung are so sexy it hurts, and this film has some of the most beautiful erotic scenes that I have seen in a long time."
5,always loved this movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. I was pleased with the quality of the DVD. The packaging was cheap, but that's no problem if you take care of your DVD's. It arrived quickly. No complaints at all."
4,"innocence, sensual, sexual, erotic, need i say more?","Other than the old cinematography, (it looks as though it were done in the 1970's)it was a great film. I bought this movie because it was about a white girl and asian man and you do not see that enough; so it sparked my interest. The man is very handsome with a hot ass and the girl is a young slender virgin who is curious about sex and might as well give it a try with this man persuing her. It has a lot of full frontal nudity, very realistic sexual scenes and just a lot of sex. Very good movie."
3,"Like Ace Combat 4 or 5, just less of the same.","Think of Ace Combat 5, replace the CG cutscenes with some uninspired live actors, the global WWIII story with the earlier Belkan war, replace the 27 missions with 18, and the 3 wingmen with 1, and you have ZERO.It isn't a bad game, the graphics are fine. The game play is nice enough. The VS. split screen mode and the weapon choices of ACE combat 4 are back. But the story and the missions are not nearly as inspired as ACE 5."
4,La! Neu? - 'Live At Kunsthalle Duesseldorf' (Captain Trip) 2-CD,"Recorded live at a gig in Dusseldorf, Germany in 1998. About as good as their 1996 'Cha Cha 2000' 2-CD {see my review} and a bit similar as well. Tunes I found most inspiring were the 32-minute ""Autoportrait Rembrandt"", the idealistic ""Comme Nuages"" and the fifteen minute ""Time"". Semi-recommended for fans of Neu!, Kraftwerk, Abunai! and Space Explosion. Good experimental krautrock {if you want to call it that}, but not for everyone."
2,Why do these NYC bohemian types think they're so smart?,I have no clue. And you won't either after reading this book.
1,I'll tell you what's not to love...,"Whine, whine, whine, snivel, snivel, snivel. Never have I read such a dreadfully forced attempt at humor, self-loathing and oh-gosh-look-down-at-my-shoes false modesty. This was the, and I mean, THE most annoying book I have read in ages. And I am not surprised in the least that it tanked. Mr. Ames just doesn't have the confidence to carry the wit. He lumbers along, clomp, clomp, clomp, dreaming of a beautiful woman beside him and ending up with some guy in a wig, again and again. I doubt he'll have any more books published."
5,Stone Temple Pilots make a dent in rock history,"This is their first commercial single they've released, but for a good cause as all sales will go to the Twin Towers fund for the victoms and families of the Sept tragedy.STP first played ""Revolution"" for a tv special originally as a Beatles, John Lennon tribute, but was delayed after Sept. 11th. Shortly after, on Oct. 2nd, the concert became ""Come Together, A World Trade Center tribute"" and STP emerged the bright shining glory of the night. It's not suprising since this veteran underdog Rock band has surfaced in spurts from good times to bad times with breakthrough music and artistry.This single and studio version of the beatles cover, ""Revolution"", is classic Stone Temple Pilots mixed with the Beatles classic rocker. Bringing modern rock into the classic rock ingredients. Also included in the single is an exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the recording session. Recommend for everyone."
2,Shallow as a puddle?,"OK so I'm not a trained critic and this is just my opinion. Does anyone else see the obvious artifice in his poetry? Constructed to tried and trusted formulae. The other reviews speak of his broad spectrum of subject matter. Reading some of his material, he knows nothing first hand of what he is writing. Maybe I am a sentimentalist, but I prefer poetry to be written from real expereince, from the heart. I find Stevens' writing literally competent, but I can't ever imagine it moving me. I need something deeper, truer."
4,Motocross Madness Rocks!,"I haven't played Midtown Madness, but my copy of Motocross Madness 2 has grown legs and walked away, so I'm buying another one!! Loads of fun for single player, and great for LAN games!"
1,Sad bed,"This bed was small-not for the size dog they recomended-and very flimsy. I could feel the tile floor through the bottom of the bed easily. The sides of the bed were barely higher than the bottom. The only thing good about this bed is the cute material, but that was not enough to keep me from returning it. Overall, poor quality and construction."
3,good music but mike patton is a loser,faith no more put out some good music in their time.angel dust by far is their best album.the reason why i say mike is a loser is because he ripped off the greatest band in all the land the red hot chili peppers.anthony and the boys have got a little fed up from time to time with his antics.look at the way he acts on stage and in the video for epic.the peppers got in a huge fight with him for this.isn't it a little werid that he stopped after the real thing album?look how different faith no more became after that.i have more respect for the the faith no more of the angel dust era than the real thing and before mike patton era(wich also was a peppers ripoff-we care alot video is a good example)i was glad to see mike did his own thing with fatihs music on their last 3 albums.-jason
3,"More music from the movie, ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?""","Frankly I enjoyed the music Ralph Stanley did in the movie than on this CD, example is his treatment of ""Oh Death"" which was great in the movie and a different treatment on this CD. I do enjoy his ""Ol Timey"" sound and more of that kind of music from the movie and was happy to have CD."
5,Want MORE CSI games,"I am hooked on CSI on TV and when I saw they had the PC games for Miami, NY, and LasVegas, I just couldn't resist trying them...glad I didn't. They are a lot of fun and keep me glued to the case until I get it solved, then I can't wait to move on to the next case. Plus, since Grissom is no longer on the TV show, I can still work with him on the games..He is there! Love them and hope they develop more games from these TV shows...I JUST LOVE THEM!"
4,Perfect size and thickness,These bags are perfect for the job. Just the right thickness and size to get the job done right.
4,Margret Weis comes through again!,"I don't see where allt he complaints are coming from here. I really enjoyed this book. From the opening scene I was captivated to read more. There is something about Weis' writingt hat makes me want to read. The setting is well thouht out and developed nicely,t he characters are flawed and as such easier to believe... I mean my gosh... they make mistakes *gasp*!With this book Weis proves once again that she can write novels other than Dragonlance and away from Tracy Hickman. It's interesting to note that Hickman is currently engaging in his own trilogy, in his own world with his wife and quite honestly, those are note worth the trouble. However, Mistress of Dragons is a fantastic read. I am eagerly looking forward to book two!"
4,As good as expected,"I wasn't expecting more than light entertainment from something written by Margaret Weis, and I got...light entertainment. This is a pleasant, quick fantasy with a simple but involving plot that will keep you turning the pages until the story ends. None of the characters are particularly likeable or unlikeable, with the exception of Draconas, who was actually interesting. His inner conflict is unusual--he is a dragon and owes allegiance to the dragon government, which stops him from helping humans.There is little information about any of the three societies, but there is enough to get by on. The writing is clean, and if not brilliant, certainly not painful. The tale was compelling enough that I will pick up the next book in the series at some point.If you don't really like fantasy, don't bother reading this. You'll think it's stupid.But, hey, it was nice for a dreary afternoon."
2,Une série de trop?,"J'adore M.Weis et ai lu la plupart de ses livres. J'ai apprécié son style facile à lire et l'histoire en elle-mme. Bref, pas de (mauvaise) surprise de ce point de vue. Par contre, les personnages sont vraiment décevants et vraiment niais durant plus de la moitié du bouquin, ce qui gche beaucoup du plaisir de la lecture. Bref, si vous tes fan de Weis comme moi, lisez ce livre mais sachez que c'est loin d'tre le meilleur. Si vous voulez découvrir Weis, choisissez plutt un autre livre! Elle peut faire bien peux que ce livre!"
3,Better than Expected,"At first, it is easy to dismiss Margaret Weis' Mistress of Dragons as yet another in a long line of tired rehashes on fantasy stereotypes and plots, but it ends up being much better than expected. While, yes, there is that age-old fantasy plot of magic and dragons, Weis manages to create enough originality from these old stand-bys to make the story worth reading. In addition, the characters are all very well-developed and engender much interest. Chief among is Draconas and Melisande. The plot itself is also interesting enough to keep your attention through the last page. Overall, Weis manages to wring enough originality from this genre to make Mistress of Dragons well worth reading and its sequels worth checking out."
1,sucks??? yup!!! i think so!!!,"Don't know if any of you ever herd of the song they sing called Mas Y Mas. All I can say is I thought that song was a hit. Witch it was or not I don't know. All I know is I liked it, I never knew the name of the song or the group till just recently. Well... to get to the point I liked the song alot, so when I found out what the name was and who it was I looked them up here and when I played there other song clips well... to be honest with you I have 1 comment, what happened!!! This stuff sucks!!! it sounds horrible!!! Man I would never waste my money on this crapy cd not ever!!! so get off of the page now and never look back again. Look at it this way if the song clips sound like they suck!!! it sucks!!! take my advice don't bother with this!!!"
5,The best war game ever created,this is a very cool game.This game is about fighting other openents with your armies.the grahics on this game are very realistic.The point of this game is to defeat the other oponent by building barracks or other buildings and train new people to become your warriors.You have to constantly get upgrades to advance to new ages or upgrade your warriors.I own this game anI think everyone should get this game who likes war games.So what are you waiting for get up and get it!!!
4,"Oldie, but a goodie","I love this game. I used to play it when I was younger and only had Windows 98. Then one day, the disc got cracked from me being rough, but I continued to use it. When it overheated, it literally exploded inside the tower and came out in pieces when I pressed eject.I sadly hadn't played it in years, and since it was so inexpensive for the original game AND the expansion, I had to get it. I was not disappointed. The game came to me in a factory sealed box and in impeccable condition. This game may look old, (and it is), but I still love playing it for hours."
2,Not what I expected for an over $200 watch...,"Pro. The watch looks as beautiful in person as the pictures, even more!Cons. Bezel top mark does not fall directly under the 12 o'clock mark, the seconds hand does not tick properly in top of each second marker, it does not tick evenly period on marker or off markers leaving me to wonder how accurate it would be, and this one royally tick me off seeing I bought the SS bracelet instead of the cheaper rubber one it's so small I can't fit my hand trough it.I'm willing to give it a try if I can get some extra links (gratuitous) from the manufacturer other wise I'm sending it back to Amazon and get something else, will contact them tomorrow and post again later.Update 6/3/11 so back it went and got myself the similar model made by Deep Blue ""what a difference"" the bezel works right, the minute hand works right and $65 cheaper.Do yourself a favor and check into the Deep Blue Models The movement is better, rated at 1000 meter and they are cheaper."
3,A widescreen wonder slashed to full screen view,This is a wonderful nature movie that should have never been modified to fit a screen. The nature and animal scenes are stunning...but when slashed to fit the screen the beauty is reduced and some of the action is out of context or obscure. If I had read the fine print more closely I would have waited for the widescreen release. I am amazed that only full screen is available. Such a shame.
5,A Movie That Will Tug At Your Heart,"This has to be one of the best movies made - ever. Maybe it's not on the huge theatrical level as the Ten Commandments but the scenery is stunning and the bears in the movie - well if you don't fall in love with the little cub and his plight then you have no heart. His adventures, mishaps, struggles and ultimately surviving and winning can bring you to tears, laughter, anger and then joy.The Bear shows what man can learn from animals - compassion and respect. That confrontation between two enemies does not have to end in death. Any person of any age can enjoy this film. When I watched it, it was with my five year old niece and up to my 75 year old father and no one left the room while watching this movie.Please watch it and for a couple of hours rejoice in nature and good. And a very happy ending."
2,funny but slow,We laughed at the antics of the baby bear and were awed by the presence of the adults. Unfortunately the overall film was a bit slow and would not inspire many rewatches.
4,How did they do it?!,"During whole movie I couldn't stop wonder how did they film all this amazing actions with bears. You really start to believe that bears 'act'. The scenery where the action takes place (British Columbia) is gorgeous. The main character, the bear cub, is unbelievably cute. The main message of the movie is very straighforward: let them live. I had some issues with the way the message was delivered, which annoyed me just a little. It was to simplified, too cliche. I would understand if this movie was for children but it's really not and PG-13 rating is right. Still, amazing beautiful movie."
4,Works well,We bought this to keep out budget in order. I originally figured I would buy a binder and envelopes separately and create my own budget portfolio but found this had everything I needed without the work and it actually cost less than putting something together on my own. We don't carry the whole thing with us so the bulk is not an issue as others have mentioned. It is pretty much the size of a large checkbook/wallet that a woman might carry in her purse. I'm pleased and would buy it again.
4,Three different journeys at once,"This is an album worth getting to know. Pieces will stick in your head after a few listens. This trio playing on the album really make interesting use of space and texture while backing up Mike Watt's surreal, yet heartfelt story-telling. Nels Cline's guitar-playing adds a fervor to the rhythm skeletons who sway and dance from song to song. The percussion is full of dramatic nuances and emulations of ship sounds and other bells and whistles. Very solid. This all adds up to a theme, and a very interesting one indeed. Listen for the subtle musical references from old Minutemen (Watt's initial band) songs and riffs. Characters from that era are referenced from that era, as well: particularly the great D. Boon. Give this one a chance and enjoy!"
3,Good Old Fun,"Don't be fooled, this video is old. Still funny just old. I thought it would be a recent video. Earthquake new stuff is funnier. It's worth the money I paid for it."
2,"Interesting, but no empirical proof","I am always reading books on parapsychology and looking for substantial empirical information. I try to keep an open mind always, but seek data that can be measured. In this sense I am a skeptic.This was a light read, with no new information and no empirical data. Believers will beleive more, and skeptics will be vindicated. The stories were interesting, and I was left firmly believing that the participants in the various 'Spiritualist"" churches really did believe with great sincereity that they were contacting the dead. Evidence of proof that mediums were genuine was offered, but again, without any means to verify the claims.The work of Kenneth Ring Ph.D. and other near death (NDE) researchers offer a much greater foundation for empirical validation."
3,Not to be taken with food,"I bought this in hopes of playing it while having a peaceful & quiet dinner. I was wrong! The songs are placed in such a way that I felt my mind was going through a horrible roller coaster ride. The songs should at least be placed in order of their beat. In any case, there will be the word ""love"" in every tune but my favorite tracks are #4,8,10, and 11. Don't get me wrong..this is a great piece of work but don't pop this in with a romantic dinner."
2,"Salt with ""very little"" piment d'Espellete","I bought this blend of salt with piment d'Espellete three times now. the first two times it was outstanding Everybody who tried it was amazed at how it could improve the taste of almost everything. The third time however the proportion of the piment had been drastically reduced. I had to buy a separate bottle of the piment d'Espellete to add to the ""blend,"" that was almost entirely salt. Very dissapointing!"
5,Cabaret at it's finest -- and funniest!,"Jim Caruso's silky smooth voice can reach inside a person and gently touch his (or her) heart, or aim straight for the funnybone and have him in stitches! Having had the opportunity to see this excellent performer in person, I'm thrilled to be able to recall his musical magic whenever I so choose. Great CD for kickin' back on a Sunday afternoon or entertaining guests -- why hire someone to entertain when you can have Caruso do it for you for just over (dollar amount).A perfect gift for the music lovers on my holiday shopping list...with Jim Caruso's Live and in Person, who needs fruitcake?"
3,Guide to the Cayman's,"This little guide book is a good item to have if you have never traveled to the Cayman Islands before. It is a bit outdated but still a good back up. Don't atke all the recommendations to heart. They tell you to skip ""Hell"" the end of the island but I think the short trip is worth it, but the airport stores accually have better T shirts than can be had on site.Beware: The Caymans are VERY expensive to visit and with the US dollar only being worth .75 to each Cayman dollar, your money does not go far. Be prepared to spend over $1000 to eat for a week, for 2 people and you won't be eating very big!"
3,Not what I hoped for,"I read a very good review of this recording and I am fond of the bass voices such as Gottlob Frick and Xavier Deprazand so I bought this. Harry Vandercamp is not that kind of bass. He is, however, a very good singer and had the repertoir been better I probably would have enjoyed the recording more. But I found little of it but the Shuetz attractive."
2,They should change the title...........,"The title Techno Attack is a little misleading. The title should be Trance with a flavor of Techno Attack. That would be more appropriate. It just does not have the driving,energy filled experience I expect from this style of music."
1,Awwwwwwwful!,"I have their first CD and I liked it, so I bought this one with a gift card. Boy, what a waste! The songs are all totally boring, and the last three are just remixes of songs that stunk in the first place. Jump5 really is kind of a boring group. Try Dream Street, Nine Days, or BBMak for songs that are actually GOOD."
5,"""Look at that man puttin' on the Ritz!""","I can't believe this went out of print - Fred Astaire and his sister, singing lots of great, upbeat, and often silly songs! It's a great view into Astaire's early career; his voice and his sense of humor are already well-developed, and tap dancing accompanies some of these tracks. These versions of ""Cheek to Cheek"" and ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" are awesome, but I admit I was especially drawn in by the siblings interacting in ""I'd Rather Charleston"" and ""Funny Face"", and ""I Love Louisa"" is just laugh-aloud amusing. If you can track down a copy, this is a real winner."
3,Watch with an open mind,"When ""big time"" rapper meets a small town girl, bad things are bound to happen. Unfortunately, the lack of wit and intelligence in this movie is made up by some excellent direction. Some of the cinematography is simply superb and stomach warming. While Ice is not known for his skills as a thespian, the ""supporting"" actors/actresses do, for the most part, a quality job. Especially Michael Gross, whos carreer seemed to end too soon for the good of viewers everywhere. If you rent or buy this movie, try to watch it for it's visual appeal, not necessarily the ""acting"" by Mr. Van Winkle."
3,Cool As Ice funny and full of good lines,"Of course this was a movie from when fashion was all about bright colors and cool slogans[the good old days!] I thought the movie itself was cool. Ice had all the good catch phrases, not to mention cool clothes. The movie had a decent plot[Ice successfully wooing a small town girl away from a guy that was nothing but a zero, no matter how rich he was] If you're a fan of the Iceman I recommend it, if not watch it anyway! In a way it made me wanna take a trip back to old school."
3,"WATCH [COOL AS ICE ]AND ""MARIAH CAREYS ""[GLITTER ]BACK TO BACK","I WATCHED MARIAH CAREYS MOVIE ""GLITTER"" THE OTHER DAY.AND SAIDTHIS REMINDS ME OF THE VANILLA ICE MOVIE ""COOL AS ICE"".BOTH MOVIES ARE NOT BAD OR GOOD.THEY JUST SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MADE FOR T.V.

1,"Dear god, what have they done.","I've seen bad moves in my day, but this takes the cake. This is so bad...so incredibly bad. I feel sorry for the ol cocaine addict."
5,"redefines ""guilty pleasure""","Can't add much to what has already been said. So full of brilliant one liners that it will change your speech patterns for life. I don't know about paying this much for it. rent a copy somewhere and keep it. If the video store complains, just cap them."
4,Good book,This is a good book to summarize all steps for many popular dances. My only problem is it does not have step graph for every steps. Only about half of them are illustrated. One step graph wins thousands of words.
3,"Good music, cheaped out on the quality","The music is very good. The problem is they released a cheap quality version. Rather than give us 256 bit rate, it is variable. It can drop as low as 128 bit. The songs are already huge in data size but the quality is variable. Very cheap encoding. They could have spent an extra 30 minutes to produce nice 256bit mp3s but instead went purely on the cheap."
4,Good,Product came shipped in an original box that looked like it was from 1965 and torn. However the product inside was fine and fit with no issues.
5,Very good techno songs. A must-have for all techno-fans.,"This is the best album Members of Mayday has released yet. It's got excellent new tracks. You MUST have this CD, or you'll be missing great brand new songs."
1,A huge headache,"This adapter didn't work in my PC, an Intel D845-PESV. None of the high-speed USB ports on the motherboard work right either. The CP Technologies card works okay with low-speed devices, but I bought it to use with high-speed devices. When in use, Windows gives messages that the high-speed device is not plugged into a high-speed port, even though it is. When I try to run a high-speed device, such as a memory stick or a USB hard drive, the system crashes (blue screen of death) when performing high-speed operations. Of course by the time I figured all this out, my 30 days were up and Amazon won't take it back. I don't know if I have a defective unit or if CP's design is bad."
5,"""Good buy for the money""","This was an easy transaction,with quick response,prompt shipping.As soon as card arrived I installed it with no problems at all.Card preforms as it should,no problems."
2,One upon whom nothing is lost,"The indisputable greatness of James relates to his having created a style for presenting experience and human relationships , distinct and deep, yet with real narrative power. The limitations of that greatness are the limitations of James own life and experience. And they relate to his having missed central elements in human experience. Compare for instance the love relationships in Tolstoy to those in James, vital realized relationships from those always on the verge of realization .The great exemplary story for this element in James' life is one of his greatest works, ""The Beast in the Jungle"" .In this story included in this anthology the hero Marcher waits all his life for the great transformative revelatory - event. In the end that happening turns out to be that nothing is going to happen.This collection contains some of James' finest stories, plus valuable autobiographical writings."
1,I FEEL RIPPED OFF BIG TIME!!!!! & MY CHILD IS SAD!!!!!!,"I bought this go cart for my son's birthday, what a mistake that was.The first one was opened and I had to send it back to Amazon, which they did send me another right out.The second one lasted one day and then would not charge ever again!The go cart is still sitting in the garage with the box next to it!I wasted $200.00+ on this go cart and my son's birthday was disappointing and a nightmare, he still talks of his go cart that is sitting in the garage with big disappointment.Amazon should have to replace this go cart again! I got a 2nd dud and gave up. I really do want my money back however, this is entirely not our fault. 2 out of 2 bad, I cant say enough DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! YOU WILL BE VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. I'm still waiting on my refund for ours. $200.00."
4,Great Toy!,I got this product for my 9 year old son for Christmas! He loves it and rides it frequently. The battery life is great so far. I wish it had a few more inches in length (he's tall for his age) but it doesn't seem to affect him when he's riding. It is quite heavy and takes two of us to get it outside but once again that's a minor detail. All is all a great product.
2,Don't buy unless you have extra time and money,"I bought this go cart in May 2005. My kids didn't get to ride it for even an hour before the belt broke. An extra belt was stored in the cart so we replaced the broken one, adjusted the tension and let the kids ride again. Again, no more than an hour later, the belt broke again. I called Razor, and they sent a replacement belt which took over an hour to put on because you have to take the back wheel and axel apart. Two hours after fixing it, it broke again. Called Razor again, sent replacement belt, again. Changed belt AGAIN, BROKE AGAIN! Called Razor a last time, and was told they would send one more belt but we would have to pay $5.00 for each belt after. Was told they could not take cart back.In my opinion, there was something wrong with the belt gear. So unless you have time and money to spend on this item, DON'T BUY IT! It's sitting in our shed and has been since July."
1,DO NOT BUY this piece of junk!,"I received the Razor Ground Force electric go-kart on Friday. The assembly instructions included were for an older version of the Ground Force, so I downloaded the new instructions from their website. I attempted to assemble it, but the screw for the steering assembly could not be unscrewed. Razor's tech support is not open on weekends, but I had two conversations with them on Monday.They finally concluded that my only solution was to take it to one of their ""certified"" repair facilities. I live in a major city but the closest one they could find is over 20 miles outside the city. I'm returning it instead -- and you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to get it back in the packaging.I would not recommend buying this piece of junk. The instructions are wrong, tech support is unhelpful (and closed on weekends), and the damn thing isn't built well.Worst of all, you'll end up with unhappy kids."
5,Had this for 2 years and still going strong!,"My two daughters ride it every week as well as their cousins and they love it.It gets a lot of abuse, bumping into sidewalks and the carts are still working strong.I recommend this cart highly! Charges quickly. Quick and easy assembly: only the steering wheel has to be attached.5 out 5 stars."
1,Horrible movie,"Despite by being over 50 years old, I had never seen this movie before so I was actually looking forward to finally experiencing it.Talk about style over substance...I kept on saying to myself ""what's the point...?""What was the point of the bicycle scene (except to promote B.J. Thomas's ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head""?)What was the point of that ridiculous New York montage sequence?This film was too cute, too pretentious, and too vapid.I guess I wasn't missing anything these past few decades.I can see how it could appeal to adolescent sensibilities, though."
5,the dawn of the buddy films,"A story of two Western bankrobbers with contemporary humor and music that gives the story a youthful appeal. How can you not love it? Robert Redford and Paul Newman bring a charm to the film that few of today's actors can muster, and Katharine Ross is both beautiful and likable as the woman who will follow the oulaws anywhere they ask her to go. The film's wry humor, however, is what really has maintained it as a true classic. How could anyone not be charmed by Paul Newman's bicycle stunts? The sets and costumes are perfectly suited for the era and beautifully recreated.Also, the ending of this film is very well done, the final frame a simple still shot of the two men the audience doesn't want to watch die. This film is a classic that generations will continue to enjoy for many years to come."
3,End of the trail,"This picture-postcard of a film is meant to be a kind of comic elegy to the Western genre, and, with the iconic charisma of Newman and Redford and William Goldman's pleasingly elemental script, it almost pulls it off. But the most effective part of the film is the second act, in which Butch and Sundance are hounded (literally) to the ends of the earth by a relentless posse that is rather obviously meant to represent the looming 20th century and the passing of an era. The overall feeling one is left with is a squirmy sense of impending doom. Hardly the stuff of whimsy."
2,you can't go back,I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out back in the late sixties and laughed till I cried.Watched it when I got the dvd and was totally bored with it.Goes to show how your taste in movies changes over the years.It is still a classic all time great movie-I just couldn't sit thru it 40 years later.
3,DVD Edition - Sound Clarification,I already own the Special Edition Laser Disc and purchased this DVD on the strength of the technical information re. sound supplied by Amazon which is actually incorrect. The DVD sound is Dolby Digital 2.00 MONO and not 5.1. One of the reviews also gives the impression that there has been a remix providing a full 5.1 soundstage. This a disappointment and if you already own the laser disc you should be induced into purchsing this item.
4,Fun.,"This song introduced me to GusGus. Still not really sure what to think of them, but they are really okay. This song is easy-going, and fun to listen to. A simple popsong, good 4 when you're in a happy and silly mood ( this is not meant in a bad way ). I seem to sense some irony in it, but it could me. Track 2 is okay, but track 3 is really great. Moves into some nice dance-area, leaves you wanting more."
2,Dried out,"I ordered this Prime through Amazon, and the tube was dried out and unusable. It must have been sitting too long, or the packaging was faulty in the first place. Amazon customer service refunded the amount for me so I'm happy, and I picked one up locally instead."
1,Received half bottle,I got my product really quick BUT half the product had spilled. Received less than half bottle. They should do a better job in securing the product so this doesn't continue to happen. However i am getting a refund so i guess that's great.
2,pass,"Lots of hype surrounding this one, not that good really. Around the sixth/seventh song it starts getting rather boring. Very derivative (VU, 13th floor elevators etc)"
1,UNHAPPY!,"I'd love to actually review the product, but I still have not received it, nor have I had any contact with the seller. Not very impressive business. The book I know is wonderful. The service by the seller.......I'd not recommend them for any future transactions. Though I had to submit a one star rating, they don't deserve a single star from me!"
4,Just in time.,I received this book just in time for school. It came in the condition and in the manner of time they said it would. I would definitely order from them again.
2,REGION B!!!!!!!!,"I am the type to read the product information and not comments or reviews, therefore, I didn't know it was region B. So of course, I didn't get to watch my movie that i have been waiting for. Sucks..... please update your movie information. That would help!!!"
3,Could have been better,"First off, I will give this film credit for not being a typical ""gorefest"" horror film, but one that instead leaves much to the imagination of the viewer. The 2 young women playing the sisters both do an excellent job, and the hands-off direction allows the story to tell itself.The reason why I didn't feel this is a great film is that the ""surprise"" elements of the film simply weren't surprising. Maybe it comes from watching so many films, but it was pretty easy to see how all things would tie together at the film's end. And for a film like this, being able to see through so much was a disappointment.I'd still recommend this film, but I don't think it's as terrific as many others feel."
1,"Infuriating ""Heroine""","This may be the most annoying book I've ever read. The main character, with whom the reader should at least sympathize, made my skin crawl. She represented every negative stereotype of women ever perpetrated. She is inept, ineffectual, irritating. She was so useless as a mother that I didn't care who kidnapped her son -- he'd be better off with anyone but her.Her ""poor pitiful me"" demeanor, her delight in her own incompetence, her willingness to tolerate emotional abuse from her husband (abuse that, frankly, I wanted to inflict on her myself) made this reader hope that she would be done away with before the book's end.I am amazed that a woman writer could and would create such a caricature of a character, much less hang a novel on an idiot like this."
2,"Where has the real Stephen King gone, I want him back.","King has seemed to have lost his edge ever since his accident. His books were frightning and yet alluring. But all his new works leave me feeling like I missed the ending. The Dark Tower was no exception. The first books hooked me (pre accident) and the later books drug me along, hoping for Kings return to greatness."
3,The ending's painfully glaring contradiction,"This whole review is a spoiler, but if you haven't even started reading the Dark Tower books, I encourage you to read on anyway. Perhaps it will encourage you to save your time for something more worthwhile.You know how Roland goes back in time when he steps through the door at the top of the Tower? Well guess what, folks? All-World, the world that contains the Tower, is a Keystone world. All-World, along with Keystone Earth, are the only two unique worlds where changes made are permanent and can't be unmade. And why is this? BECAUSE TIME FLOWS IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION!!! So if time flows in only one direction, it would have been IMPOSSIBLE for Roland to go back in time the way he did. So not only was the ending lame, it was contradictory as well."
2,Lame,"Unfortunately to explain how lame this book was, I would also have to disclose some plot spoilers. So, I'll generalize as best that I can. First, most of the characters have their bit of the story end in an unsatisfactory manner. In particular, ""the bad guys"" who are often built up over hundreds, if not thousands, of pages are dealt with in an incredibly abrupt manner. Also, I felt like the book should have ended about half way through. At that point the story felt naturally over. After the half way point, I kept asking myself why is there still more?I doubt many people will read this review before reading the book, but if you do. don't bother. Just enjoy what you have read so far. After all Steven King gives similar advice at the end of this book."
5,perfect,I LOVED each and every one of the books in this series. I am a firm believer that they are King's best work. I just want to say that I think that the ending to the Dark Tower series was perfect. Have King's stories ever ended happily? I can't recall at the moment one that did. I think we all enjoy his books because King weaves some of the sickest most disterbing stories around. He loves to toy with his readers' emotions. How can anyone expect this story to end any differently? If you were reading this book and expected everything to be spelled out and end well you were only kidding yourself and have no reason to be upset.-Tosha
1,negative reviews are correct,"I liked this series quite a bit up until wolves of the callah. That book was ok, but was probably the last ""good"" book of the series. Song of Sussanah was just plain boring. The last book, the dark tower, was just pure, utter garbage. There were some good parts that kept my interest, but overall it was trash. The ending was ridiculous, and the killing off of all of Rolands companions made me loathe this book. I thought it was just me, that as I got older, I lost my taste and patience for kings style of writing, but looking at the reviews here, I know its not just me that feels this way."
3,VERY mixed bag,"This book finally gets down to serious action and that is a relief. It could have probably been the best in the series but King putting himself in the story just doesn't work. Period. The author anticipated the reader's hostile response in his afterward with damn good reason. ARGH. Fiction is supposed to dispell reality, don't have the egotism to write yourself into your own book even if you've been in a bad accident! ARGH! Ending was weak on several levels - 1) Crimson King - would a little development have been asking too much? 2) Death of Mordred - did anyone not see how that was going to happen? 3) Susannah's departure - what?. 4) A new major charecter 99.5% of the way through the series who has a huge impact on events. Still; I think Roland's ending in the Tower was spot on and the re-union in Central Park was cool though sappy. There is a lot wrong with this book though and Stephen King's comments afterward don't help."
3,good ending but too many loose ends,"I disagreee with anyone who says the ending was bad. It leaves it so open to the imagination and you can relive the story again and again and again- fantastic.However as many people have said the way he got there!! Oh My God.. it was rushed and the final conflicts with mordred and the crimson king? what a load of PISH...There are still too many loose ends. He should have waited a few more years and got it right.One thing that really annoyed me thought is when SK refers to the beefeaters guarding Buckingham palace- they dont they are at the tower of london, it is the household division that guards the palace. A simple fact that can be gleened for the most basic internet search.once i read this well it went to pots for me. In fact thinking about it the whole book goes to pots from this point onwards except for the last line.. what a way to end, great."
2,A Better Ending,"Spoilers ahoy!A better ending: Roland and the reader, now having journeyed across the years over thousands of pages, open the door at the top of the Tower and find: a pile of cruddy metafiction Stephen King novels to read again. Roland, horrified, blows the reader's brains out to spare us the thought and then eats his sandalwood gun. Just before he pulls the trigger, he mutters vaguely in the direction of the reader's corpse: ""Stephen King is the real Crimson King."" Fin."
1,what a let down this last book was,"I wished someone would have stopped me from starting this gunslinger series, so that I would never feel this way. I could not even get though to the end of the book because I was so let down. It seemed that SK could not wait to get the story done with. A story that you could not help but be a part of. Indeed, I felt so drawn into the story that I felt all the emotions that a good writer like SK wants you to feel. So I felt part of the ka-tek. But what he did to this last book made me cry. All the waiting to be reunited with the family only to see them thrown aside like nothing but side thoughts instead of great characters is such a shame and should be a crime of some sort. That Sk got away with this and then had the nerve to say at the end don't write him any letters because he would not respond is the icing on the cake. I wish I could tell him this myself. I will not read anything by him for a long time because it will take a long time for me to forgive him."
2,WOW WTF?,"I don't read a lot of Stephen King, and after reading this series I may never again. Wow, I have no idea what happened. Its not like the ideas and concepts presented where over my head or anything, I understand what King was trying to do suspense wise. But he created a fascinating world(s) and then didn't explore or explain any of it. He made things so abstract that I found much of the suspense to be gone by Book 7.Congrats on making this far along in the series. I seriously thought about stopping after Wolves of the Calla. The series is very abstract, and Book 7 is almost as abstract and nonsensical as Book 1 except longer. Books 2-4 where entertaining and very much worth reading, I'm not sure what happened after that point though. I had to force myself to read book 7 if only because I had spent so much time reading the first 6 books, ugh."
3,Fun but to long and making little sense,"I usually don't like Stephen King books but there are some I have like this series... more or less. For those that trully like fantasy or sci-fi (or a mix of both that this seems to try to be) the story continuesly disappoints because its fictional premises follow almost no logical path, what path it follows constantly conterdicts itself, and it leaves more holes than it fits. For example most main characters become expert marksmen with little practice yet Roland had to receive training. Also guns seem to always reload themselves even though no one is carrying amunition, and the world is held together in a rose... come on. Also this whole series, including this book, are just to long and therefore often boring. If you can get past all this and just enjoy the ride then the whole series, for the most part, has been a fun ride."
1,"No, No, NOOOOOOOO","**Semi-Spoliers*Eddie, Jake, Susannah, and Oy, above all sweet sweet Oy!~ How could you give him and Jake such horrific ends Mr. King, HOW??!? I wish I could go back in time and have stopped reading this series at Book 4. Books 1-4 will forever be cherished editions in my book collection. I read books 5 and 6 and was like, ""uh"".... and continued to read for the sheer fact that I THOUGHT they would get better. Book 7, just because i thought, yes, let me see my beloved ka-tet make it to the tower. All for naught, as no one made it except Roland, and did he die a happy man knowing he'd succeeded? Or live on to live a full but sad life knowing his success? NOPE!! HE STARTED BACK AT SQUARE ONE! ANYWAYS, suffice to say, ""Mr. King"" ""hurried"" up and finished this series because the magic of the story was gone."
2,I Wrote My Own Ending,"I heard the warnings about how bad the last book was, but I thought that it could not be that bad. I enjoyed alot of King's work(The Stand,IT,Everything's Eventual,etc.)but the warnings are true!I was shocked when Eddie was killed off, then I told my self ""Mabe King just wanted to kill him so he could make the last half of the book more serous,because Eddie was liked the comdy relef in the series"".But(yet again)just when I am finally getting used to not having Eddie around, King kills off Jake! And I cryed for poor Oy, I could feel how sad he was. Then the I stoped reading and got on the computer and wrote my own ending, it is almost 300 pages long and it starts right before Eddie is shot in the head(In my version Eddie dosent get killed)it is called 'Dark Tower 8 The Tet dosent end so badly'(I don't think Badly is even a word, O well King made up alot of words in his story)But(again)the book kept me reading to the end so I guess its not that bad. So long readers!"
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","I was wholly dissapointed with Book 6, and while Book 5 was ok, I felt it wasn't as strong as the first 4. Book 7 is up to par with the first 4 though. Seems like King pulled out all the stops and went all out for this one. It really starts off with a bang, and doesn't slow down at all till about page 200 or so. I was a little dissapointed on how some of the charachters ended up (see Walter), but overall I thought it was pretty satisfying. Even the end wasn't bad."
2,Terrible End / Ok book,I really enjoyed the series but not so much this book. If you think about how big the Dark Tower books are a really bad ending can make it seem like a huge waste of time.I won't go so far as to say it was really bad but if I knew how it was going to end I wouldn't have read it.The main problem with the book was that there was no real action in the book from 50% forward none from 75-95. Nothing really gets tied up. It seems as thought there should be a book VIII that is the real ending.
3,King's Advice,"I loved the series and hated to see it come to an end. The only advice that I would leave for those that have yet to finish off this series is that when King tells you that you should stop reading, stop reading."
1,I gave it one star because I can't give it zero.,"I have been a tremendous fan of this series for almost ten years now, and have brought many people into the series. I would now like to apologise to them.Between the easy dispatching of Randall Falgg and The Crimson King, the ""happy reunion"", his asinine self inclusion, the ""sneeches"" (doesn't that count as plagiarism?), and the cop-out ending; I would rather have had Stephen King come over to my house and (...) on my face than to read such an insulting final chapter to this great work.Thank you."
5,fantastic finish to a fantastic journey,There seems to be so much hate for this ending but i absolutely loved the ending. It was haunting and beautiful at the same time. nothing is ever perfects and i do have a couple of gripes. The way a couple of characters exited the story was a little disappointing but the positives to me outweighed the negatives. I greatly enjoyed this book as well as the entire series. What is found at the end is amazing and will have you thinking about it for a long time. a great great read.
1,A total disaster,"My God I only wish that I had read Ethan's review before I bought the book. I totally agree with most of his opinions, but to me and new readers be warned, IF YOU ARE GOING TO READ THE SERIES, STOP AT WIZZARD AND GLASS, Mr. King in the words of one of the clerks when interrogating George Lucas, ""I want my 24 dollars back"".I still love King's early works, specially The Stand and IT which I have read several times, to this day I can not stand being near a clown."
5,good reading,"just adore this series. sorry i'm close to the end. and i just adore my kindle! what a great invention.... have all the books in one easy to carry device, so i will be able to always go back and re-read. no more cluttering book shelves!"
5,Bravo,I finally finished the last books in this series and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed them. Mr. King weaves a fascinating story full of rich details.
2,Overblown and disappointing,"I'm in the disappointed reader ka-tet on King's last Tower book. The book was just too long, too complicated, too over the top, too much of everything. Giving birth to a spider boy, come on!I found it a cheap move to write himself into the story.All-in-all disappointing."
5,Loved it. So much.,"It amazes me to see so many negative reviews targeting this brilliant series. What did you guys want? Also, what the heck have you guys been reading that is so much better than these great stories that Stephen King wrote for us?I absolutely loved this book and every book that led up to it. I've never been so engrossed in a book in my entire life. I thought the ending was brilliant! I expected to come to the Amazon page for the Dark Tower and read nothing but 5-star reviews. It was perfect. Perfect, perfect, perfect. You know how I know that? Because I enjoyed every second of it. I'm not even a big Stephen King fan, but this series and the final book in particular absolutely blew me away,Stop nitpicking! Enjoy what has been given to you (for free, if you utilize the library). The DarkTower VII is one of my favorite books of all-time. Stephen King has changed my life through the power of fiction. Read it, enjoy it, and don't be asnob."
2,Steve didn't learn from his Ah Ha moment in the previous offering...,"I'm really don't like self-aggrandizement. Quit talking about yourself...you are not a Hitchcock walking your dogs through the background on a movie set. But live long and prosper.John S.In Phoenix, AZ"
2,King just wanted to end it.,"I don't really blame him. He was probably being pestered mercilessly to put out book 7 in the series. But if he was going to put out something this bad, I'd have rather just always wondered how it all turned out. King states at the end that it was ""the only ending."" Actually, I could think of several that would have been much more interesting. That said, if you've read the six really great previous books in the series, you're not going to stop before you've read this one."
2,Weak,"I don't write long reviews and I am not a regular Stephen King fan only having read two books outside the Dark Tower series. I hated how he seemed to be trying to explain to his readers who had been long time fans why he hadn't given them the books they wanted to read. Does he really believe that God or ""Ka"" gives him the ability to write and dictates when he can or can't? That was absurd. Secondly, stay out of the book. I wasn't reading these books to find out a biography of your life and divine purpose in creating this story. I don't really care about the ending being a loop and I actually wish the other 4 didn't get to end up fat'n'happy together. I just wish King would stay out of his story. It seemed like he just didn't have a way to explain the book so he wrote himself in- really cool."
3,This book has too much info on Singapore and none on Borneo,"Frommer's info is well-written and clear but 228 out of 299 pages deal only with Singapore and this book has no information at all about Sarawak and Sabah, the best places in Malaysia in my opinion.The info on Taman Negara Park and it's activities, such as rafting were scanty and there was no info on the islands of the eastern peninsula."
4,16-bit platforming at its finest!,"This game is about a Vampire Hunter named Simon who hunts draculaIn this game: you must make your way to the castle fighting Monsters, Ghouls ,Ghosts ,the undead and yours truly Dracula! Aiding you in this Quest(or game whatever you like to call it) are various sub weapons and items such as a drumstick, knife,axe,holy water, and my personal favorite The Cross. This game like most early Castlevania games was difficult but still insanely fun"
2,Loses power quickly and can become stuck in camera,"I originally thought this was a good buy. It did not hold power as long as the original Nikon battery, but it is much cheaper. However, I soon found that it began to lose power *very* quickly. Even more important, it started to stick in the camera and was very difficult to extract. This happened with two different Nikon cameras (P80 and P100)."
5,Anthological performances!,"Gyorgy Sandor established an absolute rapport during all his life with Bartok' s music. The whole spirit of the Hungarian master has been preserved with all its uniqueness, expression and unsurpassable sonority, Sandor' s phrasing simply has no parallel. He sees far beyond the score, and for all of us who had the enviable fortune to watch him twice in Caracas in the eighties, were exception witnesses about his genuine incisiveness and powerful fingering.In case you acquire this album, I can guarantee you won' t need to worry about any other performer."
1,TA this isn't,"This is NOT a book that will help you pick stocks using TA, it is about (as far as it's about anything) working out general market sentiment, ie will the DOW go up or down. For individual stock picks, how to tell from a chart which way the price is going, it is completely useless. Given that Technical Analysis, in most investors' minds, involves chart reading, and understanding indicators (RSI etc), this book is misleadingly labelled - there is one (short) section with a few OHLC diagrams, not very useful at that. There are many books that cover the topic, this isn't one of them."
1,C'mon MAN!!! 6 AAA Batteries....Ugh!,"I wish I was in the focus group for this one. It takes 6 AAA batteries, WTF. C'mon man, who uses AAAs let alone have 6 of them. Why not 4 AAs.Add to that, it's rather difficult to get into the battery compartment, with it's tiny screw and using a small Philip's head stripped one of them.Well, it does make a nice chew you for our lil' one and the dog.One more time - C'MON MAN! Test these products with real citizens and not your company yes men/women."
1,order not received....dollars wasted.... do not place any order for this product,I have ordered this product @ 15 days back.. still not received the delivery.Also the order does not provide any tracking number.After placing the order after 2-3 days I got email that my order is shipped. The email does not have any tracking number. This is simply waste of money.My suggestion - Do not buy this item.. its totally waste.
1,low life battery,These 10 battery pack is equal to the 2 pack branded batteries you get in the stores with respect to battery life.
5,Works great for Hex Bugs,These work wonderfully for my son's Hex Bugs. When the bugs are left on all day and kill the battery they're much more economical to replace then the Silver Oxide cells that may last longer. Will be buying these in bulk!
3,I gave it a 3 for the doubt.,"I got this for a laser sight, it would work all right, just use it for little while, then i put my weapon away from couple days, when i came back to check it, the battery were death... i dont know if it is something wrong with my hardware, or the battery, happened twice, and i just stopped putting in battery while not using it."
3,Read the fine print - Make sure you order Maxell Brand,"I purchased a three pack of (10) batteries = 30 total from Snowvoice. The picture shows the Maxell Brand, but I received ""Tianqiu"" Brand from China. I have not tried the batteries out yet, but make sure you order from a vendor that states you are receiving the Maxell Brand. Yeah the price was too good to be true so buyer beware."
2,batteries didn't last,Batteries were fine when I first put in our candles. Lasted less than a week only using 3 times during the week. The price is low but so is the quality.
5,Outstanding movie --,enjoyed the movie -- especially the acting .. It would not be any better !!Recomment this to anyone ..
5,Irony and Foresight,The movie line written from the 1960's is eerily similiar to Pope John Paul II's life and surprise move from Cardinal to Pope. The story of how a new pope is elected was very good to know ahead of the process that brought Pope Benedict in after the death of JPII. Most highly recommended.
2,batteries not included,My Son loved the voyager but couldnt play it long because the batteries wouldnt stay lined up and the toy would turn off. A Second voyager had the same problem. We wouldnt recommend this toy until the maker can fix the problem.
2,Don't buy it,"My kids got this toy for christmas and it was broken it wouldn't even turn on. I got a new one, that one was better it turned on but it would turn off on its own when we were playing it. This happened time after time. It is going back to the store and we are getting more leap pad books."
4,A WONDERFUL TOY FOR KIDS!!!!!!,"This is a machine with colorful, interactive scenes and engaging stories that teach young kids reading, math, spelling, problem-solving skills and more. It also remembers each child's journey, and lets your child determine where to go next. They can have different adventure with each game.This Adventure Station has a scrolling color touch-screen, LCD screen, attached magic stylus pen and full QWERTY keyboard. My son just love to use their magic pen to touch the colorful screen, type on the keyboard and see questions and words on the LCD screen. As kids progress through each adventure, engaging educational activities and lessons cover subjects such as reading, spelling, math, science and history."
4,A very entertaining toy!,"My son (age 4 1/2) received this as a Christmas gift and I have to say he plays with it a lot more than I thought he would! He actually sits for awhile each time and always asks questions like ""Mom, how do you spell ---?"" For [price], this is a great find!"
5,"Nice, inexpensive Vanity","My 2 year old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it. The assembly was very easy. The vanity and seat are sturdy though I do put it against the wall because it can be knocked over if bumped hard enough. The mirror is plastic but it doesn't seem to bother her. The accessories are sturdy and well put together. They don't seem like they will break easily.I also got her the extra accessory kit that had the dryer, curling iron and fake makeup in it. She loves the dryer. It makes a quiet noise but no air.She loves to brush her hair and teeth in front of her vanity."
1,Missing parts,"My little one got this toy for Christmas, I purchased it at toys r us. When we put it together we found it came missing a leg, I have called the manufacturer for the leg 3 times and they simply arent standing by the product because I havent recieved the leg which makes it useless!I cant locate the receipt to bring it back to the store and get my money back, and they dont have any more to replace it. So we are stuck with a usless vanity.Thank you!"
5,Heiser hits the nail on the head!,"I have been interested in the UFO phenomenon since I was a little kid, but was frustrated by most people's categorical dismissal of ""little green men."" Anyone who has seen a UFO or been abducted is just assumed to be delusional. Later, when I became Christian, I didn't know what to do with the whole concept of aliens. This well-researched book integrates both aliens and Christianity, showing the danger posed by the bene Elohim, who have been causing mischief for a long, long time. Read this book. Share it with your friends."
1,Not a Christian book,"If you are a Christian beware of the ideas presented in this book. It is not based on the beliefs of the reformers. Heiser is hard to pin down on his beliefs because of what I call his ""shotgun"" theology. He sounds like a Mormon, a Jehovah's Witness and sometimes like Herbert W. Armstrong and all this while claiming to be a solid conservative Christian. I know this is a work of fiction but it does present ideas that I consider contrary to the Faith. Someone has pointed out that Heiser appears to have written some of his own five star reviews. If you will click on the profile of Michael Heiser on the review about the book being a ""mind grenade"" and read his other reviews there, it does seem like Heiser is the one who wrote that glowing review of himself."
4,Good monitor,The color and picture are excellent. My only complaint is that the monitor makes a weird snapping sound every 30 seconds after I turn it on. This lasts for about 5 minutes.
1,Terrible,"I bought this because other reviewers ... compared her to Ledisi, Jill Scott, and Erykah Badu. She may have a voice that compares to those artists, but she has absolutely none of the creativity and originality of those three giants. This cd is boring and monotonous. Every song sounds the same. A good voice just isn't enough. A lot of women can blow, but more is needed to separate a good singer from the rest of the pack. What makes those other artists that I named so great is that they take risks and incorporate other types of music like reggae, hip-hop, jazz, go-go, and even latin music into their work. They are not just singers, but artists!"
4,LA Law Student,Pretty good explanations- I like the sample questions organized by topic in the back of the book
4,interesting,never knew that the animal world could turn on people . Food and shelter triggers attacks but this was unreal.everyone should watch this video
1,Discontinued for a reason.,"If you're considering this product, please don't. It's an abysmal piece of technology. I am so unhappy with it. In 15 months, it has spent more than 4 months in the shop. The motherboard, the LCD screen, and the keyboard are all unreliable. Save yourself some pain and stay away from this product and the company that would market it."
1,Terrible,According to people I am attempting to talk to it sounds like i am in a muffin. Cord is super short. I guess this is what I get for ordering a cheap mic
1,Olypus me52w Noise cancelling machine,"it was overpriced, I felt duped, because I paid almost two hundred dollars and eighteen pounds cash to the postman at the door before I could even have it. It was unbelievable. I just hated this and the dictating machine that came with it. I ended going to my local to buy something else. I really felt that that was a daylight robbery to me. I have lost my trust in ever using this company again. Good luck to your customers!"
5,Works Very Well,"I did not expect this microphone to work as well as it does. This microphone is beyond what I can describe to you and accurately portray what it can do.Down side is that it will not work on my laptop; it does need extra 'juice' to make it work. I knew this before I bought it and it works very well with my Digital Voice Recorder and my Sony NEX-VG10 camera. I read that someone is going to use this as a boom mic and I think I am going to as well, that is how well the sound is coming from this very inexpensive microphone.Buy it, I don't think you will be sorry. But remember that whatever you are using this with must provide power to the microphone if it is going to work.A shame my laptop does not."
3,Eh... Not Super Impressed,Maybe I'm doing something wrong or have a setting off but I find the built in microphone on my sony audio recorder sounds better than this thing. Wind screen slips off to easy too. Don't know how I haven't lost it yet. I guess it was pretty cheap - hopefully I will find a use for it.
4,have not used it yet,I have not used the microphone yet. Too much is going on right now. I expect to be able to use it in October and look forward to enjoying it.
4,Microphone,Works well when you can get the line-in volume set up correctly. Must use with a set of headphones or you will get squealing feedback.
5,Olympus Microphone for digital voice recorder,Better clarity and less noise. Adds value to the sound recording by having a clearer sound.
2,Poor sound capture,"I bought this mic hopping that it would improve the sound capture on my Olympus recorder. However, after testing it I determined that the built in mic on the recorder was much better than this mic. $16 down the drain. I would not recommend this mic."
4,Megadeth Muzak,"Definatly for the hard core fan only,this makes a nice addition to any Megadeth collection. If you've heard the version of Trust on the ECW soundtrack, expect more of the same here. The songs are all instrumental w/ Marty soloing Dave's vocal parts. All songs pretty much sound like the originals in this respect. The exception being She-wolf which is done acoustically w/ kind of a Spanish rhythm. Different, but well worth a listen."
4,bubble-gum for the ears,"As an Indigo Girls, Jo Dee Messina, Nancy Griffith, Catie Curtis and Bonnie Raitt fan, I find the Dixie Chicks a light-hearted edition to my collection. While superficial and simple, the dixie chicks harmonize well together and always bring a smile to my face."
3,Good not great,The only song I really enjoy on the album is Wide Open Spaces. The rest of the album is ok but not outstanding.
4,A very good start...,"A very good debut album for the trio we have now come to know as The Dixie Chicks. (I believe they released a few albums on smaller labels with a different line-up.)The songs are all very good, but stand-outs are the title track, with it's wonderfully lilting choruses, the spunky ""There's Your Trouble"" and the opener ""I Can Love You Better"".A good start, but I think the Trio improves on their next release, FLY and really hits its stride on their latest effort, HOME."
4,"If I bought it, you can.","Ok, first off, I hated country. A lot of my friends liked it and it became the good music to listen to, but I loathed it and my radio station was at 99x. But then, while I was at soccer camp, my friend, AKA my roomie had the CD and played it all the time. At first I was like cut the crap off cuz I hated it, but then after a while I started liking it, and I started to learn the words so it became stuck in my head. So, when I got home I went out and bought it, which isn't like me and now I like it a lot. I am not crazy about all the songs and that's why I gave it four stars. It's really just like the first 7 or 8 but by then I'm ready to change my CD anyway. But it is still a great CD. And if I learned to like it, ALL of you can."
5,It doesn't get any better than the Dixie Chicks,"With all of the controversy in recent years, it's easy to forget that the Dixie Chicks aren't just excellent musicians, they were groundbreaking. This is the album that started it all."
4,A sweet surprise,"I'd heard about the Chicks when their first CD came out, but never got around to listening to them til ""Wide Open Spaces"" - what a nice surprise! Very sweet vocals without being bubblegum, a real fresh sound. A lot of good material - it's great to hear ""Loving Arms"" again and JD Souther's ""I'll Take Care of You"" stands out too. Lots of good vocals. I can't get this off my CD player, I keep going back to it over and over."
2,30% pleasure / 70% pain,"While I do enjoy the slower songs on this album, where the lead singer's voice is decent, the faster songs make me cringe. When I first bought the album, I enjoyed most of it. As I listened to it more and more, I realized just how bad the lead singer's voice can be. The music is great, the background vocals are great (I'd personally like to hear the other two sing some songs), but the lead vocals are really lacking. I can't say I *do not* buy this album, but make sure you really like the group before buying it. Don't get it until you've heard more than just a couple of their songs. I gave my cd to my girlfriend. The good songs just don't make up for the numerous bad ones."
3,Pretty Standard Stuff,"I bought this CD after seeing the Dixie Chicks at Lilith Fair and on TV. I liked the CD, but there was nothing special here. The attitude so prevalent at Lilith was missing in the CD. The songs are OK, with exception ""Let 'er Rip"" which you have to skip."
5,Pure Country & Rock,"While the Chicks are country in more ways than one they're also alternative. Natalie Maines' voice is amazing! And, Martie Seidels' fiddle skills are champion!! As for Emily Erwin's instrumenatal talents...just one listen and you know this girl can rock a house down!! The songs are liberating, heartbreaking, passionate, and relaxing. This album is well deserving of the Grammy it recieved. I got it in Dcember and it hasn't been out of my CD player other than to listen to it in another one!! A must have for any country fan!! I can't wait for their next one!!"
4,best theory text book,"This is hands down the best crim theory text book available. It's designed for undergrads, but it provides a brief, thorough, and direct synopsis of all the most important theories a grad student might study for comprehensive exams, so it's a great way to review and to make sure you're covering all your bases. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because this edition is already 7 years old. A ton of research has come out in the last few years, and I think theoretical topography has changed quite a bit, especially with self control theory, developmental and life course perspectives, and recent work on communities and crime dominating the field. A must-have for any criminology grad student."
5,works great!,perfect for hooking up my headphones to my ps3. easy to use and didn't need to buy those $100+ ps3 headphones. use this as a cheap and effective way to use your own headphones with your ps3.
5,Good,I needed this to finally hook up the sound of my PS3 to my stereo and use the video cord in my projector. Got a male to male audio cord to complete the connection and works great! thanks
1,Around the World in 30 Days,I took a month for me to receive this from Hong Kong. A small child could have walked it to me faster.
5,Works On PS3,This plugs into the RCA analog outputs on the PS3 cable allowing me to plug in my Plantronics GAME COM 367 Headset into the outputing 3.5mm female of the adapter.
1,Alternate Choice,After reading the reviews I started to look around for an alternative to the Babies R Us hammock. I found a great hammock that looks more sturdy at www.greatbabyproducts.com. It is only $11.95 plus shipping. It is held on the wall in three places and looks to much more heavy duty. At least it is worth looking into.
1,Warning! This product has been recalled!,"I attempted to purchase this item at a local Toys R Us location recently, but was told at checkout that the product could not be sold because it was recalled. I then did a search for similar products online and found this same exact item for sale here. I received the product today and it is the exact same one that was recalled. I have no information on the details of this recall, but please do not purchase this product!!!"
3,The grip was too big,I'd planned to run this cable through some 1/2 inch holes but it wouldn't fit. The plastic grip part is bigger than the adapter head. I suppose that might be a nice feature but I couldn't use it. I went to wally world and got another 50 footer that worked fine.
5,Nostalgia Revisted,Ironside - Season 2A great series that brings back memories of a better time and place.I watched this show every week with my parents and siblings.Families did things together back then. It was a fantastic time to be a kid.
2,NOT Hearing Impaired Friendly,"Just a warning: While the video is OK, I can give only two stars to this set because I am hearing impaired and need subtitles or closed captions, neither of which are available on these discs. I feel they are considerably over-priced without these features. If you can hear fine, you probably will enjoy this set."
2,Eleanor Powell (a Bio without Life),"This type of book is more like a research paper than a biography of a major star, and one of the great dancers of the period. The Bio is a dry review of who she was and what movies she performed in, but lacks any of the material that makes her a living woman with feeling and talent. It would have been good for a graduate paper for an MA degree, but not much more. Any one can compile facts. The secret of a great biography is the making of the subject come to life. Even as a MA study, I would only give it a B-."
5,A valuable book!,"""Ngarrindjeri Wurruwarrin falls into the category of books which are likely to be valuable to almost all sectors of the reading public, and at the same time, to be criticised by almost all sectors of the reading public."" Deborah Bird Rose"
2,Boring,"I love romances but this was sooo boring I could not wait till it ended, normally I watch the movie rental a few times before my time is up not this one, once was painful enough. Both of these actors are great but the spark was just not there and the script was just bad."
5,Great Film...,"I've heard so much about this film and so I decided to give it a whirl.I was not dissappointed. This was one of the best romantic dramas I've seen in a long time!The lead actors have a wonderful chemistry. The story line kept my attention. Most of all,this film is inspired by a true story, Which I appreciate. I also love how there was a bit ofhumor added to the storyline. I LOVED every minute of it."
5,Wonderful true story,"THis was a very good love story, was unpredictable, and I loved the fact it is based on a true story, fast shipping!"
2,Sorry Fellas,This is the consummate chick flick. Based on true events it reads like a campfire story for the romantic notions of love without boundries. Having to watch this after an actual wedding only added to its pompous blow by blow of situational angst for the poor main characters. Have your phone handy to sneak in a sports score or two during the swollen violin scores you will endure. Brace yourselves and be willing to present a hanky.
2,JUST AN OK MOVIE,"I LIKE BOTH RACHEL MCADAMS AND CHANNING TATUM (DON'T KNOW IF I SPELLED NAME RIGHT), BUT THIS WAS NOT A GOOD MOVIE FOR EITHER OF THEM. THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAT MOVIE BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD STORYLINE, BUT TOO MANY POSSIBLE SCENES BETWEEN THE 2 OF THEM ARE MISSED AND THERE'S ALOT OF UNNECCESSARY FLUFF TAKING THE PLACE OF THAT. ALSO, THE ENDING DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ENDING. I KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING GREAT TO HAPPEN AND IT DIDN'T! I GUESS IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO ROMANTIC MOVIES THIS MAYBE ALITTLE BETTER FOR YOU, BUT IT JUST DIDN'T CUT IT FOR ME. ONLY ONES (THAT DON'T HAVE COMEDY MIXED IN) WORTH WATCHING MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE TO ME ARE THE NOTEBOOK AND TITANIC AND THIS ONE REALLY REALLY DOESN'T COMPARE. I PROBABLY SOUND LIKE A JERK, BUT I ACTUALLY WISH I COULD GET THE TIME I SPENT WATCHING IT AND $10 I SPENT BUYING IT BACK HAHA. I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS."
4,Nice story...but could have been better,"I enjoy seeing Rachel McAdams act, and while I have to admit this is the first time I've ever seen Channing Tatum act I thought he did a great job with his role. If you're looking for a nice romantic movie, this won't disappoint. However, after I read about the real-life couple whose story inspired this one, I was a bit disappointed in how Hollywood depicted this couple. I think it could have been so much better if certain elements had not been removed from the story, while others were added. Some characters could have been left out entirely, and I think the movie would have been a lot better (example, the old boyfriend). In short, while I think this is a good entertaining movie, I think it could have been so much better if the story line had followed the true story of the couple who endured so much difficulty to stay committed to one another and their marriage - now that would have made for a great movie!"
5,great movie,This was a great movie. It was about two people who were in love and if one person forgot who you were how you would get your significant other to remember what you shared and most importantly who you were.
4,better than expected,Rachel McAdams is great as always. Liked her since Red Eye. Tatum does a good job also and the story does not end as easily as it could have. I liked it.
1,a real disappointment,After reading the book i expected a reasonable movie version. Instead I got Paige the brat. Paige the entitled. Paige the bully. It was all about Paige and very little about her husband. He was going through ton of stress and agony that never got expressed on the screen just a nice guy gentleness and one punch. He was truly the perfect gentleman. He even learned to love the cat. Great for a superficial story but not a great movie. I would have liked him to have had more voice to express anger even at her for lets face it ruining his life and not trusting him. Instead its all about Paige and her rotten family that were trying to rewrite history. How many more secrets did they keep? So not a great movie. If you like date movies its good but don't expect any realism in the story.
3,This movie was okay,This movie was just okay. It was heartwarming. the actors could of been picked better. McAdams was great just the guy was alright.
4,A great introduction to things Egyptian!,"I bought this book for my son who is an avid reader of anything Egyptian and he devoured it happily. He found the interesting facts hard to resist and shared them with all of us. As a professional historian, I usually eschew things like this but I found it engaging when I read it. This is the type of book that homeshcooling parents love because it encourages a reluctant reader to learn and it cements the learning of one who is motivated. I highly recommend it."
4,Excellent title song and music industry changer...how?,"Beautiful work by the band on the title track. Haunting, yet soothing vocals, and a very tight musical group.The ""music industry changer"" part comes from the highly advertised fact that this album was supposedly the first direct-to-hard drive recording ever. I recall the sticker on the front cover - very prominent.Who knew that ten years later pirates/thieves would be shutting down record stores and stealing musicians' incomes? I wonder if the execs ever second-guess the digital decision? Well, as long as THEY get paid, I guess they don't care.Sorry, this has turned into a rant. I did want to communicate that this was a groundbreaking album in its own way. Shame that it's out-of-print."
3,It's okay,It works and my 8 month old daughter can use it. I think it may be better for kids over age 1. my daughter is just learning to use a sippy cup and this one is too big and needs a lot of liquid since she is not tipping it high enough to drink. The top is rubber and has two bumps on the sides which should line up in two grooves but it is hard to get them to line up. It is very easy to clean but I am not sure about the spout because I think it traps stuff. So far I only have put water in the cup but it seams to trapping dish soap because after a few tips it seems that the water has bubbles in it. I squeeze the spout in all different directions when I rinse but I feel like it just isn't rinsing well.
2,My baby + this cup = LOTS of clothes changing & mopping!,"I like the size of this cup, the softness of the spout, the cleanability, and the handles. What I don't like is that it LEAKS LIKE MAD!I don't know if it's my daughters technique, or the cup itself, but every time she takes the spout out of her mouth, a large portion of milk runs down her chin and soaks the front of her shirt.If the silicone top is not lined up absolutely perfectly (and my baby has a way of causing it to become misaligned) then it leaks from around the gasket. Also, whenever she drops the cup it always seems to land with the weight of the cup pressing on the spout, allowing the contents to flow out onto her tray or the floor. It is a huge mess maker."
3,Starts off really slow,"It seems like only the last 15 or 20 minutes is Dennis Miller at his ranting best, when he gets going on Barbra Streisand and pro-life activists. The beginning is not funny, he talks about himself too much! I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it."
4,Complete Greek Cookbook,"The book is interesting in that it has a lot of legends, origins, and stories about Greek cooking. It is a very thorough book, and I know I will enjoy it in the years to com."
2,This book didn't survive the trials of time,"I ordered this book because I remembered enjoying the entire quartet when it first came out. However, I must say, that I didn't manage to get through the first half of volume one this time around. I found it very tedious and, though I kept trying to read further, it didn't seem to get any better."
2,Tedious,"I am finding The Jewel in the Crown Vol. 1 hard going. The sentence structure is convoluted and difficult to follow. The way the story moves from one time period to another is also a problem. No doubt the author chose that construction, but I do not care for it. By the way, I am a former English teacher and have read widely. This book is just not for me."
3,Pretty Good Feelings,"This is basic guitar-driven pop rock from the U.K.. Most of the songs have sing-along choruses and are a lot of fun. This is not ground-breaking stuff, but ""Good Feeling"" is a good time! For more mellow, but ultimately more mature and accomplished recordings, check out their second album, ""The Man Who,"" and their latest, ""The Invisible Band."""
2,Prefer the new stuff but...,"Update: After a few more listens, this album has grown on me some... still far from my favorite but quite enjoyable on its own...--------------------------------------I put this cd on my wish list after liking every song I had heard by Travis and recieved it for Christmas. The first half of the cd is hard, raw, and practically unlistenable. The 2nd half is mostly ballads but none as good as the new albums. You should listen to some samples of this album to judge for yourself but I really like Travis, but I really don't like this album."
4,"As usual, a great read from Ms. Nunez","I have read most of Ms. Nunez books and found them wonderful, dignified stories. This one was a very interesting story about a marraige falling apart because the people involved were seeing things differently. That may be an overly simplistic way of putting it, but don't we all sometimes find ourselves shocked to find out someone else sees the same situation completely differently than we do? I always find it intriguing to see a situation from the male and female perspective. I think most people will enjoy 'Grace'. ... and if you like Ms. Nunez' books, you may also enjoy 'When Rocks Dance'. I've had to buy at least 5 copies because people took mine. It was one of her earlier books under the name 'Elizabeth Nunez Harrell', and people often tell me they never heard of it. It is a very original work about love and voodoo set in the Caribbean."
5,Perfect...,"If you enjoy stews, I can think of no better pot. Calphalon heats up quickly and browns better than anything I have seen. This pot has a large surface area, so it rarely requires a second round in the browning stage. That great browning translates into a wonderful deglaze. It is shallow enough that you can easily work the base with tongs, but tall enough to handle everything without causing a mess. It's more than happy to go into the oven/broiler.It's rare to see a pot this size at such a low price. Even rarer is to see it come with a lid, a lifetime guarantee and a reputation as solid as that of Calphalon."
3,"okay for the price, but disappointing overall","The glowing reviews here encouraged me to buy this pot -- I also couldn't resist the price. But I've been somewhat disappointed with it. The size is somewhat awkward -- too wide, really, for soups and stews (though it can still be used for that purpose). It is as wide as my Anolon 5-quart sauté pan (which I bought at the same time), but the sides are too high to make it useful for sautéing. The handles on the sides and lid get blisteringly hot. I realize that this is because the pot is built to withstand high heat, but it's hard to get used to the idea that I have to have an oven mitt on my hand in order to go anywhere near it. Unless you plan on broiling this pot (and who would want to do that?) its uninsulated handles seem rather impractical."
5,Great Pan! Professional Hard Anodized 8 1/2-Quart Saucier--,"I've used it to steam mussels, cook on the grill, make seafood bisques and stews, and it is FANTASTIC! I'm a fan of Calphalon's Professional Hard Anodized line, not for the trendiness, but for the durability and versatility. For that price, it's an absolute STEAL!!!"
1,"Female Power Is Awesome, But I Despise Alicia Keys","This film celebrates the lives of four women. I love that it's an old-fashioned film. I also love the interracial love story because diversity is a beautiful thing. I love how the women work together to support each other. Even though this is a film about African-Americans/Black-Americans, I think people from other races will be able to relate to this story 'cause they are females and love is one of the themes in this film. Unfortunately, there is racism and violence in the film, which stays true to history and the present century. It's a great film, but I returned it because of Alicia Keys. I no longer listen to her songs because she is a home-destroyer and she hates Nigerians. So I removed four stars because of her."
4,A touching film,"The Secret Life of Bees unfolds in South Carolina against the backdrop of the Civil Rights tumult of 1964. Totally frustrated with her abusive father and pushed over the edge by his beating of Rosaleen, their African-American housekeeper, fourteen-year-old Lily runs away with Rosaleen in tow. Seeking some knowledge of her mother, whom Lily accidentally shot and killed when she was four, she heads toward the only place she knows may have some connection to her. Lily and Rosaleen are taken in by the three African-American Boatwright sisters, August, June, and May, who have a prosperous honey business. August teaches Lily to care for the bees and the women help Lily to heal. I appreciate the honesty of the film that is exemplified when August tells Lily what she knows of her mother and of love. A touching film."
5,A Real Keeper,This is one to purchase and watch over and over.Great acting wonderfully shot a must see!
3,"Great movie, poor dvd quality","I ordered this movie because I fell in love with it the very first time I saw it at the movie theatre. However, I am GREATLY disappointed in the quality of this DVD. I have ordered a number of DVD's and have never had an issue with the movies either freezing, stopping or skipping to the next scene."
2,not all that satisfied,Well if we get one back from the manufacturer that actually works right it might be a great little system. It will be good for small spaces such as dorm rooms. But as of now the volumn doesn't work after a week or so of use. Waiting to see what the manufacturer does.
1,first time unsatisfied,"I usually like what I puchase on Amazon, but this product is a disappointment and I'd like to return it but ..... It's really not what I wanted, but that's my fault. It's too bulky for travelling."
3,"Well written, uninteresting, uninformative","This book is indisputably well written. But it taught me nothing about Burma I didn't already know and it was rather dull in much of the book. The author uses small stories about different characters to tell the story of Burma's recent history and repressive practices, but the stories just aren't that interesting in many cases. Captivating this book is not. I didn't find it to be travel literature or politically informative, and as fiction it was concise but lackluster.Paul"
5,Keeps your drink cold all day!,"I love this product. If you start your day by adding ice, it will keep your drink cold all day. Even if you leave it inside a hot car. I only wish it could hold more liquid. Other than that it's perfect. And you only need one hand to open or close it."
4,"Great bottle, not so great straw","I purchased the children's model of this water bottle for my boys and it is great. It keeps the water cold, never leaks and is very durable. My only issue is with the bendable straw. It breaks easily and even though there was a replacement included in my bottles, it only took two months for 3 of the 4 to be broken. But not to worry, replacements are available now through the manufacturer. You can get the customer service phone number for Thermos from their website and order as many replacements as your heart desires."
2,PLEASE REISSUE THESE ALREADY!!,"The Pirates are a great rock and roll band. Of course, it would be nice if someone could see fit to REISSUE these, so that the rest of us can enjoy great rock and roll without being ridiculously PRICE GOUGED. Great rock and roll should not just be another privilege of the obscenely rich like everything else seems to be these days. Over $100 for a CD? Give me an f---ing break!"
1,Beware - no Anita 'Day.,"I bought this video twice by accident. Trust me: there is no Anita O'Day in it. Kenton himself is great of course, though it is a brief concert video."
2,Nothing out[smells] zero points of articulation,"Umm, let's see, they look absolutely horrible in robot mode, their ""transformations"" (i.e., pulling apart two big chunks of plastic by half an inch) are so idiotically simplistic that they suck all the fun out of transforming, the legs don't move at all - oh wait, I forgot, they don't even HAVE legs, they just have a big block of plastic below their torsos that is somehow supposed to look like a pair of legs. ..."
1,Piece of junk,This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. In the last year and a half I have replaced the belt 12 times. The hepa filter in the back gets so hot that it burns your leg. By the time I get to the second room the vacuum turns off because its to hot and it won't turn back on for hours.
1,Laughably vulgar,Laughably vulgar. Despite the subject matter it struck me as almost juvenile. Maybe it was the male prostitute and the vomit or maybe it was the sex scenes with excrement but I felt I needed to stop reading this for my own well being. Ended it up tossing the book into the recycle bin.
5,"Fantastic, A triumph","The back of this book is a bitterly unworthy read: ""...an author whose reputation in Arabic is deservedly vast,"" ""...among the six finest novels to be written in modern Arabic literature,"" etc. This is not a book whose merit should ride on the coat tails of its author's nationality. I find such ""praise"" offensive. This is a book that can and should stand on its own amongst the greatest of the Western ""canon"". It has a raw, frenetic emotionality that is transfigured into overwhelming beauty through transcendent prose. I can only imagine its impact in the original Arabic."
1,Not enough substance,I was disappointed in this book. There is not enough substance. I thought it would be a more indepth study of the weekly parsha.
1,Yeech,"I have discoverd that I do not like Mr. Whites writing style so this is a very biased review. I am sure many people love this series, I tried and it is not me. Read Lee Childs series about Jack Reacher, much better."
4,I have read every single one of this series,Really there is nothing more to be said? The stories are full of interesting scientific information as well as being full of suspense and interesting characters. Having visited Sanibel Island this past year makes the work that much more interesting to me.
4,It may take some time to appreciate,"The concept behind Tey's *The Singing Sands* immediately drew me in. A bit of poetry written on a newspaper leads the inspector to solve a crime that only he believes is indeed actually a crime. Yes, very interesting. However, once I started reading I found the pacing a little slow. Grant was far more introspective, more concerned with his own fears, than most mystery protagonists. Which was not, by any means, a bad thing. I just had to adjust my mindset a bit. Once I realized that this was not to be a typical solve it and feel good mystery, I found myself sinking in, slowly. Admittedly, it took me a couple of days after finishing the novel to appreciate it, to find it a satisfying read. But one thing has definitely come from reading *The Singing Sands*--I'm now looking forward to reading more Josephine Tey novels."
3,Fairly good mystery reading,"Good story, good characterization good descriptions easy to hold onto difficult to put down."
3,Witchcraft WAS practiced in Salem,Interesting premise - witchcraft WAS practiced in New England in the 17th Century! Extensively researched but dry writing style make it a chore to read. I got halfway through and my interest waned.I was referred to this book by a Robin Cook novel. Curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the book. The novel is based on the more widely held view that ergot caused the hysteria in Salem.
3,"Compelling, complex and even strategic reading!","Out of the Banks books i have read this didn't seem to reach the typical Banks standard. The story was fascinating however the structure didnt merge as well as his other books. In his other stories (especially the ones with more than one tale going on), there always came a point where the two stories merged and the twist became apparent but i didnt see that this time. However, Banks' standard has not faultered. This book was still exceptional and the complexity of it once again takes Iain Banks way ahead of all other SF writers"
3,good but not up-to-par Banksian SF,"This book was advertised as being a SF book and after reading all but 2 of his SF books, I looked forward to Inversions with a salivating tongue. There is no science, technology, aliens or spaceshipsb (as is typical and wonderul with Banks' SF). The story takes place on an undisclosed planet with human or human-like individuals. The two stories (which are well told) revolve around two kingdoms on the same world. Kings, Dames, harems, doctors, generals and Barons are scattered throughout the storyline which creates a gothic yet civilized portrait of the world.Banks doesn't let the reader down with his refreshing injections of humor and darkness. I kept reading hoping for an angle of SF but was ultimetly left without. This would be a great book for fantasy readers, but as a hard SF fan and especially a Banks space-opera fan, Inversions was a disappointment to my expectations... however, I enjoyed it whilst I read."
2,Not believable or compelling,"I love to claim this excellent series as one of my favorite in scifi, but this book is nothing better than embarassing. The entire book takes place in ballrooms and courtyards with yawning noblemen and the politics of high culture: easily the most boring of Banks's novels. I'd read War and Peace if I wanted that kind of novel.Also the plot is just preposterous, especially the ending. Almost everyone in the story completely breaks character for the last chapters. Well, that's a little generous. They break SANITY for the last chapters!Skip this one and head straight for Look to Windward; it's one of the best of the series."
2,S-N-Y-P-A-Z,This isn't all that great of an album.It isn't worth buying at all unless you collecting Chi-Town music.
1,snoop should retire,"first off, if you're going to buy this album, you might as well just throw the money away, the album is garbage like the last fifty albums that hes basically threw up - please, look elsewhere if you want some rap"
2,this cd is his worst,this cd sucks the title dosnt even go with the songs the title says that the cd would be about how bab his life has been. this cd was a waste of my money
2,"Good man, bad singer","I give him credit, he does alot of charity work, and volunteers to do things most people wouldnt, that is why i give him 2 stars instead of one, otherwise he cannot sing. I think his live performance on Metallica ICON on MTV proved this. Just listen to his voice try and sing a song that actually requires singing!! says alot about this genre of music."
5,Jamie McGuinness Rocks,"I don't write reviews. But we trekked with this little book 10 years ago and found it informational as well as highly entertaining. Of the 100s of travel guides I've owned, this is the only one I really remember. We still talk about Jamie as a friend. There wasn't anything missing, and these hikes rock."
4,"Fantastic, weird.","Brutal and funny from start to finish, Best of TS! showed me office life from the pov of the temps that keep shuffling in and out. There's also some interesting stuff about French labor practices and working construction jobs. Much better than the publisher's description would lead you to believe. Studs Terkel was right on in recommending this book.It does lose a star, however, for some unfortunate typos."
1,Get toner cartridges? HA! Forget it.,"Printer works ok, but ours was shipped broken and we had to ask for a replacement. That nonsense took 2 weeks. Now the toner cartridge is almost empty after only a month of use and - guess what? Nobody stocks the cartridges except here at Amazon. And they're over $60. OUCH! Guess we bought the WRONG printer."
5,Cheaper and better than the PUR filters,I couldn't believe the PUR filters were more expensive than the actual Whirlpool filters. With the subscribe and save discount along with getting filters automatically I don't know why you would purchase these anywhere else.
3,20 cents a day for this filter,"Easier to install than the old fashion one, that is for sure. But $35 for every 6 months? That is 20 cents a day!!!!! $70 a years, or $700 for the life of a 10 year refrigerator. How much did you pay for the refrigerator? You see where I am going........"
5,Best Deal Ever,This is the best deal i ever got. I spent 3 times amount of money to buy filters from Sears. I am so happy that i found this deal.
