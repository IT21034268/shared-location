3,Pretty Good!,"I enjoy the convenience of this watch! It is very easy to slip on and off and the glo feature is very bright!The thing I am not so mucha fan of , is the little grippy parts at the end of each ""arm"" are coming loose. If they arent there then how will the watch stay in place?"
4,Sweet story.,"I laughed, I cried, I loved it. The author really has a way of making you appreciate the complexity of the characters. He is wild but loving and I found his childishness to be endearing not stupid as some of the bad reviews claim. We all play grownups too much. This book was a great escape. I am looking forward to the rest of the series."
4,I liked it!,"I thought The Wild One was a great read! I finished it in a single night.I liked Juliet's strength of character and her soft side for Lord Gareth. I was amazed at the twists and turns the book took (I don't want to give it away!).The ending completely took me by surprise, I just wasn't expecting anything like that to happen. Of course now I have to read the next book.At first, Gareth didn't strike me as a good sort of character, he was too childish, rash and just not mature enough then he became something better. I didn't know about his particular job he picked up but I darned glad his brother was a Duke and can save him at any time.Regardless, the story was intricate but I was able to keep up with all the plots and I can wait for the next installment."
2,Disappointing storyline,"It had an exciting beginning that captured my attention but it got annoying quickly. Spoiler alert. The main hero was a spoiled brat who didn't think twice before acting. And the heroine was not that much better. For one thing, how stupid to lose that much money when your life depended on it. And she kept thinking about the dead brother, if he was such a mature and honest man, he would have married her when he found out she was locked up. Frustrating storyline."
4,Great fun,"Time period stories are romantic, interesting, and full of adventure... this one fulfills all the stereotypes. Characters are intriguing, likeable, with a story line that's fun and not too far fetched. I enjoyed."
4,THE WILD ONE,REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. LOOKING FORWARD TO READING MORE OF DANELLE HARMONS BOOKS! These brothers would be so fun to meet.
1,Slow,The pace of this story was ridiculously slow. The plot was also as empty as the lives of the upper class being written about.
1,I don't understand the rave reviews,"I'm so glad I didn't pay for this book. I love a book that draws me in and makes me feel like I know the ""people"", like I'm invested in the outcome of their lives. This book had none of that. The author repeats about 90 times( ok, a mild exaggeration) how romantic the ""hero""s eyes are. Really? I got it the first 5 times. By the way, What are romantic eyes? The author doesn't explain. Even now after I JUST finished the book I can't think of a single memorable moment in the whole book. I didn't care that she was leaving him. I didn't care that he got hurt. I didn't care about the LONG dream that the ""Hero"" had. I didn't even care about the baby in the story! It was a book full of nothing. I have no desire to ever read another book by this author. I read the small bit, in the back of this book, from the 2nd in the series. You couldn't pay me to read anymore of it. End of story."
4,Great story,"This was the first book I have read by this author. The story moves at a fast pace, and it is hard to put down. The main characters have a good chemistry and you will be cheering for them to make it. Can't wait for Lucian story."
3,fine,"It kept a good pace, a fine yet predictable story line. a quick and easy read. might read more of the series"
3,Good reprints of Mustang Test Articles,"It isn't by any means complete -- there are magazine tests of the Mustang that I know about that aren't here, but it's interesting. It makes for a good read for Mustang lovers."
5,Works Great ***,"Although I thought that I had ordered the red one, I got he black one instead. I'm not complaining... it does a great job and is easy to use."
1,Poor - Pop and glitz compensate for lack of musicianship,"Vanessa-Mae is one of these ""child prodigy's"" that never developed. While she posesses great technical skill, she lacks an understanding of the music and is therefore unable to make meaningful interpretations. To compensate, Vanessa-Mae has opted for what I call ""classical-pop"" - classically based music spiced up to ""wow"" the listener. I'm sure there's a place for this style of music, but I find it trite and shallow and I shall not allot any of my shelf space for this video."
4,"ProFoot Halo Heel, Women's Fits All, 1 pair (Pack of 4)",Fits nicely into the heel of a shoe that does not have any other protection
1,Learning American Sign Language,"I was very disappointed when I saw this book. I ordered it used and it looked like a dog ripped it up. I don't think a book costing $38.00 should look like this. I was also very disappointed to see that I could not return this book. I ended up dropping this class and have no use for this book anymore, and I don't think anyone will buy this book from me considering the shape it is in. Overall I was not satisfied and may look to other sites for purchasing books from now on."
2,book conditions,the book conditons stated that it was in very good condition however when i got the book it had writting in it and water more like red jucie stain on the side of the book. however the book did arrive at the time and date that i was told
3,ASL Book,the book was fine in quality- took too long to ship. took several weeks to recieve. unacceptable.
4,ASL 1 book,"I thought this book was layed out great, very easy to understand and the excercises were helpful. The only problem I had was that a few of the signs in the book are outdated and no longer used. My professor was deaf so luckily she knew all the new signs. [...]. (click on main dictionary)"
3,Amazing,"The booked showed up late, and I didn't get the DVD that was suppose to come with the book. Other than that the book showed up in the condition promised."
1,"Does not fit well at all.....frustrated, need to buy something else...","This has been one of my worst earphones I have ever used. Everyone's ears are different and this does not fit well with mine at all. My ears are the average size but this thing feels like it's just hanging on. The earpiece that curves into your eardrum doesn't help it either. They have three different size earpieces and all 3 do not snug tightly.At best, it's like it's hanging onto my ear, with earpiece loosely in my ear. Not that easy to wear either. Basically I need 2 hands to get it on w/ ease. With 1 hand, u'll have some trouble, but eventually will get it.Volume was just 'ok'. Sometimes a bit soft, sometimes a bit loud, typical for most earphones (depends on ur phone of course as well).Conclusion: There are many other choices out there. This is not a good choice. I got frustrated from using this that I'm probably going to buy something else."
2,the truth is...,"I was going through my books to see what I have so that I could start practicing character design, I found this in my closet and started looking through this book.The truth is, although the drawings are top notch, they are old and out of date. No one draws these kinds of drawings any more. I was totally disinterested and put the book away. Better to get an up-to-date bookpublished more recently, check out the books from erik goldberg, or christopher hart."
3,Good reference book.,"Gives easy to follow step-by-step instructions on animation. Book shows basic poses, movements, shapes, hands, etc. Great reference book for would-be animators."
1,Not Recommended,"The produce was received as defect, but passed the return period as they only give 7 days, and I didn't get to use it about 1 week later. Also, I tried to call and e-mail the seller, but the office was closed for about one week, by the time I contacted them, it's already pass the return period, so I had to send back to Mio for repair. They replaced System Board and sent it back to me. Don't feel conformable about this seller nor the produce. Don't recommended!"
2,2 stars for bad marketing,"I have used the C230x and do not want to pay $70 for an updated map. So I am thinking of getting a new one, model C520, but I just find out from calling MIO that I will have to pay for an updated map for this model any way. To me, this is bad.Any way, I drop the idea of buying new MIO. I hope this helps anyone thinking of buying new MIO C230x or C520 because you will have to buy updated map; they should offer updated map free of charge to new customers."
3,slow to capture GPS signal,"The main problem I found with this GPS was the slowness to capture the GPS signal. Somethings it takes more than 2 minutes to find the GPS signal.Mio also stopped to update this GPS, so you cannot update the maps inside anymore unless you unlock your GPS software and install some other vendors software"
2,Amazingly poor documentation,"I'll be brief... I'm not unfamiliar with GPS (I have 3 others). The website is terrible. I can't find map updates. Email to customer service for location goes unanswered. The manual gives good detail about using the features except the basic gps. Only 2 ""favorites"" are allowed. The manual explains how to change the name and/or address of the favorites, and the instructions are wrong. Once you figure it out, clicking the ""change address"" does nothing. Clicking the ""rename"" works fine. Nice looking unit though.. which is typical of Italian design, and poor service is typical also."
3,Great GPS but version 2006 MAPS on a new GPS like this one is not good,"While this GPS is fantastic, I was surprised that it came with version 2006 MAPS which are 2 years behind.Shame that it comes with old maps. You will need to pay around $50-$80 to get new maps. :("
4,Amazing GPS - more than value for money,"I have been using this GPS for a month now. Initially, i was very skeptical as i had not really heard of MIO before, but am very impressed with the performance, response/start-up time, and feature packed unit. This unit has one of the best features for the price (text-to-voice, mp3, bluetooth, SD Card slot, etc.), and can head-on compete with the ""big 2"" value for money. I gave it 4 stars because of the 2.5 pin jack, (instead of the standard 3.5 pin jack available for most mp3/GPS devices) and the Bluetooth connectivity (that works fine) but needs to be paired everytime you switch-off or diconnect. The user menu, though very detailed, may not be very intuitive for the not-so technical folks and reference to the manual/CD may be needed."
4,Something diferent,"Do you remember how you always asked yourself ""What if bad guys get away and they are not caught at the end?"" well you've got it, this is a diferent story, a funny but solid story, really an interesting book, a unique one! Jo soares is probably one of the most inteligent persons over earth and he took his whole talent to write this amazing story he is gonna take you so much into it that you are gonna finish the book in some hours without even notice it!"
1,Decorative only!,"I like tea, and I wanted an 8-cup teapot that would last a long time. This item looked good in the reviews. The first time I made tea in this teapot, I heard these high-pitched ""plink"" noises when I put in boiling water. After only FOUR pots of tea, the glaze both inside and outside was covered with innumerable cracks and water oozed out. It was my impression that making tea involved both tea AND boiling water, but this teapot was so poorly made that it is not possible to make hot tea without destroying it. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,"Another ""quality' product is gone forever-Caveat emptor","I received a Brown Betty 8 cup teapot quite a number of years back. My son broke it while horsing around in the kitchen. Since I had such a good experience with my Brown Betty, I ordered another.What a complete waste of money. The glaze cracked on the first pot of tea, the second pot of tea caused the pottery to crack and gushed tea all over the kitchen table. The handle fell off when I tried to pick it up to throw in the rubbish can. I always warm my teapot up before use, this time was no exception.Shoddy construction, plain and simple. Is the teapot made in England or Malaysia? I don't care. It's just another example of cheaper and faster construction causing the product to become a laughable shadow of it's predecessors.I have an old heavy glass Pyrex teapot my wife found a swap meet a long time ago. Looks like I'll be using that teapot as long as possible."
3,Brown Betty Tea Pot,This tea pot was purchased as a replacement for our broken pot. It's appearance was exactly as expected. The only potential problem is the loose fitting lid. While pouring that last cup of tea it is wise to anticipate the lid falling off.
4,Door chime dlivers,"The HEath Zenith SL-6142-c is a cheap item which does its job almost flawlessly. Out of the box I installed and it worked: one battery included with the kit was dead (took me a few minutes switching batteries to figure this out). I had to change the settings on the main wired element because the bell would ring when my neighbor had a delivery, I guess has the same radio frequency on his bell... It was easy: unscrew one screw on the wired element (remove from wall of course), place the provided black cap on the jumper on #5, do the same for the puch button element and you are all set.I would recommend this purchase."
5,It works great,"I like this thing! It plugs into the wall socket, so you don't have to mount it to anything. The front bell makes 2 tones and the back bell rings 1 tone, so you know which bell it is."
1,Did not work; had to return it for a refund.,"Well, you get what you pay for. When will I learn that lesson?Biggest issue: the battery would not stay in place. The metal bits at the end that hold the battery in place, weren't designed in a way to keep the battery from popping out. So, after fumbling and trying to tape the battery in place, I finally got it to stay put. But then, the chimes would only OCCASIONALLY work. Very unreliable. The chimes also sounded tinny. Don't even get me started on having to pull out the miniscule pins to change the chime patterns. This is a terrible product. For those for whom it worked, I consider you guys lucky people. If you're not interested in pressing your luck, I suggest a better product made by someone else."
3,doorbell,"I like the idea of a doorbell to plug into an outlet. This particular one does not chime loud enough. And to change the ""song"" of the chimes, one has to do all three items."
4,Trying to decide.,"I'm trying to decide wether I should or shouldn't buy this product due to the other reviews?But, I think I should it looks like a great product!"
2,Widescreen!?,"I should have been suspicious of the claim that this is the ""widescreen"" edition before I spent my money. They did not shoot TV in widescreen back in the early 80's. So I checked it side by side with my old tape recorded off the air, and the way they made this into widescreen is to crop off the top and the bottom of the screen! This is inexcusable! Why remove part of the picture and try to pass it off as though it's a good thing?The story itself is still fantastically written... what there is you can see of it."
5,V The Classic 80's Series,"When this title became avaliable in Dvd format I thanked the studios to make posible,without doubt this masterpiece is one of the best 80's shows in TV.I was a boy when the show arrived in Spain and it became a superb sucess the first time that the Tv's played.It was followed by a sequel The Final Battle which I think that also must be released in Dvd but not the tv series whom have lack of imagination and where a mere tv weekly show without the charm of the original. I wonder this release is the first of many more 80 tv hits such The A Team,Knight Rider,Miami Vice and many more which I think also must be released in Dvd format to bring a new excitement in tv series."
3,Only two reasons to watch V,And they are;a) Michael Ironsides as the ruthless soldier of fortune after the invaders. I saw this series when it first came out and later when reissued. Ironsides is just so much fun to watch. 'Say goodnight hot shot'.b) Jane Badler. HUBA HUBA !!the rest? YAWN !!!
2,Not precisely what is advertised...,"The quality of the DVD is mediocre, the sound is not updated and it is not simply what is advertised."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"It's the middle of the cold war, and nations across the world agree to share equal knowledge of technology gifted to us by an alien race. HELLO.I bought this DVD because of the reviews I read here. But it turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The writing, the acting, the plot--you know all those elements that make a movie? Not one of those was done well enough in this movie to leave me and my family with a single memorable line to quote afterward.While we watched, we got to a point where, if one more human blundered things with one more stupid, senseless act, we were going to start siding with the aliens.But nothing is completely useless; it can always serve as a bad example. And this movie is a perfect bad example of sci fi."
5,V- series 1-2-3,I seen the the 3 series of V when shown on TV from 1983-1985 i was 9yrs old at the time and i loved it.I have now bought the original mini series to go with the final battle and the V complete series.I bought them because i enjoyed them and i thought my 12yr old daughter would also like them and she does.I rate rate V 1 to 3 a 10/10 for each one.
5,Excellent Mini Series,"Basically it is a sci-fi version of the German Occupation of France WWII with the Resistance, annihilation, not great effects, but great story and ideas"
5,The Precurser to ID4,"If you ever wanted to know what influenced Independance Day watch this flick. I remember seeing this when it first aired and I enjoyed the mini-series, and the DVD version still hasn't lost it's steam. It's also great hearing the Director's Commentary throughout the entire film. Looking forward to the release of V: The Final Battle on DVD."
4,Memories,Excellent - just showed it to my kids and they fell in love with it as I did when I was a kid. You get the point right away and it doesn't feel preachy at all
5,"Entertaining, suspenseful, and exciting!","I highly recommend ""V"" to anyone, who enjoys sci-fi films of the 80's because the characters are fascinating and memorable.""V"" stands for Visitor as in ""Enemy Visitors."" These ""Visitors"" as they're called are actually alien reptiles, who resemble human-beings.Their plot to control the world, but whether they do, or ont...well, you'll just have to rent or buy the movie to find out for yourself--you won't be disappointed!"
5,The BEST sci fi flick EVER!!!,This movie is the one movie I saw and immediatly wanted a copy. So I searched and searched and after much time found it for $56.99 and bought it. It may seem like a lot of money but that should tell you how much I LOVE this movie. I also have the complete set of books in the series.
4,Mike is coming back,"Still not at the level of tubular bells,amarok and the like, but much better than t3es lunas, and not as simply classified as this last one, in my opinion. As mike's old composition, the great ones, this one represents a difficult task for the seller in order to find a stand in the shop to show the cds. Chill out? New age? Techno-rock? Just Mike. That's why it seems Mikes coming back from the shadows of the last albums, still good music in my opinion, but not in the line of the very best from Mike (which is still the most)"
3,Quatro Lunas,"Oldfield dismissed his last album of new material (Tr3s Lunas) as ""chill out music for a video game"" (which was included in some versions). Okay . . . so what's the excuse for two more CDs worth of the same? LIGHT AND SHADE is certainly not the nadir of Oldfield's catalog (I save that honor for EARTH MOVING), but it's not very inspiring, either. How can an album that utilizes all the latest cutting edge technology already sound dated? With it's echoes of Ibza techno thump (that Oldfield did better on parts of Tubular Bells 3)this album sounds like it could have fallen off the truck in the late ninties. And while a lot of the tracks have nice melodies (Sunset) the sense of ""push a button"" computerized laziness overshadows the preceedings. It's like a breath of fresh air when Oldfield's signature guitar enters the soundfield . . . a real instrument, played by a real musician."
4,Hard but comfortable,"I'm a writer, so I'm sitting down all day long. I use this cushion on a hard wooden kitchen chair, and it makes a big difference. It is not squishy at all, it is very firm, but does give just enough cushioning to help make the chair comfortable."
1,Obnoxious odor,"Upon opening the package.... the smell was terrible. I assume it was the foam smell or cover. It was so bad I put it in the garage to air out. After 2 days it still smelled. The best way to describe the smell is if you get a new item made of plastic that has a super strong petroleum/paint smell. It bothered my wife even more than me so I know it was nothing peculiar just to me. Besides the smell the cushion loses all its ""poof"" and becomes totally flat after sitting for a little while. It is supposed to conform to your body but instead gives you a 1/4 inch pad to sit on. I only weigh about 120 lbs ...so its not that I'm a big guy. I sent it back and would suggest you not purchase it."
2,"Slow to start, never got going","This book reads like either, A) an early effort written before a good author learns pacing and plot development, or B) a movie or television treatment flushed out to book length.We know the answer isn't A, since this book was published, and presumably written, years after Bear wrote memorable series like Eon and Forge of God. If the answer is B, well then, it's going to be a pretty darn slow moving movie.Bear gets points for showing us interesting dinosaur behavior and for incorporating real people and famous fictional characters into the story line. But the story never takes off and soars.Rating: If you are a dinosaur fiction nut: 3 starsIf not, 2 stars.If you are looking for more quality fiction from the author of Eon and Forge of God, keep looking."
5,Highly recomend this book,"A friend bought this book for my 13 year old daughter. She is new to quilting and using a sewing machine, and has found this book so easy to follow."
5,Quilting Book,"If you are wanting to learn how to quilt from beginning to the end, this book is what you need!"
5,the stray cats live!,"If you like swing, you can't afford to miss ""The Deluxtone Rockets"". Rock and roll guitar lycs combined with traditional swing brass give these guys a distinct ""swingable"" rock and roll sound that makes you wanna jump, jive and bang your head."
5,A Month at the Shore,"Ease read, but had it all! Family drama, mystery. love and sex (not too graphic.) Learned about plants and flowers. too"
5,Good book,Read it in a day. It was romantic and mysterious. It kept you guessing and rooting for the shore kids.
4,A Month at the Shore,Captivating storyline. The author did a great job with a surprise ending. I was on the edge of my seat.
3,A month at the shore,The book was ok. Didn't much care for the ending. Don't know why you want so many words. I like to read not write.
4,Good,Had a enjoyable read here. Enjoyed the way it worked out for the family in the end. Would recommend book.
1,Very disappointing.,"Have no idea how book earned 4 stars. I really wanted to like it. I kept reading hoping it would get better. After finishing 40% on my kindle, it was so boring and disjointed I finally gave up and read the ending...which I absolutely never do. It wasn't any better either. Not worth your time."
4,a great read,"Through the many twists and turns this turned out to be a great read.So many story lines cleverly woven together to bring all the pieces together at the end.I really did not want the story to end.A happy resolution reached and the possibility of follow on stories.Relaxing, interesting, absorbing, delightful."
4,Great read,Replacing and intense at the same time. You want the best for the main characters. Twists and turns at every page.
3,Best sound quality of the various versions of this album,"With some effort you can resequence this into Groovy Decoy and discard the rest. This CD has superior sound quality to the separate CD releases of Decoy and Decay that came out many years earlier. Neither this album, nor any of the other versions of it, is being reissued on CD when YepRoc reissues Robyn's albums in 2007/2008, so you'd be best advised to pick this up."
1,A big disappointment! Returned it ASAP!,"I enjoyed the ""2002 Ways to Be Romantic"" book and thought this would be at least as good. What a disappointment! I'd be embarrassed to suggest these ideas for a date, and if someone suggested them to me, I'd be running the other way! Go to the stockyard? Please! Gregory J.P. Godek has much better ideas..."
4,very good,"I used to be a huge fan of Diana Palmer until all of her books started sounding the same. Maybe she should stop putting out so many and go for quality and different scenarios than quantity.That said, this is one of her books I still have and reread occassionally. Hunter is a half-breed indian who thinks that Jennifer is too much a ""cover girl"". She is in fact a top geologist whose looks have actually hindered her. She is in a male dominated field, working with Hunter (a chief of security) trying to uncover an ore that rebel countries are also looking to find and sparks fly. I recommend this DP work. Both of these characters were briefly mentioned in ""His Girl Friday"" or ""Hoodwinked"". I can't remember which."
5,Trains,"This album hasn't been as revered by me as much as it has been many Hitchcock fans, but I have to say I really enjoyed the DVD and have a new apprecation of the orginal after viewing the DVD. Recommended!"
5,Absolutely spectacular!,"Clear and concise. Well written and easy to understand. Logical. Well researched. Upbeat. Lovely. I highly recommend this book for anyone even remotely interested in the Catholic perspective of Mary. Once you turn the first page, you won't want to put it down."
3,One generation off,Jesus' mother can in no way be his bride. His bride can be a mother though. Because this blessed woman said yes to birthing the Messiah does not in any way make her the originator of that grace. Mary gave birth to the man Jesus. She can in no way give birth to the Alpha and the Omega or be a mother to the Alpha and the Omega.
4,ahh the lovely japanese voices....,"i was a bit dubious about getting this Cd at first ,as i knew all the talking was in japanese and i dont speak much japanese. but if you've got the comic version of Blind Target, its pretty easy to follow! the songs are lovely, (although Trowa's ""make my way"" is a little scary first time round ^_~). ""Brave Eyes"" is a gorgeous song, probably my favorite, and their japanese voices are very easy to tell apart. new fans of GW might not enjoy this cd as much, as it is a little confusing, but if you're a die hard GW fan like me, get this CD!"
2,Disappointed,Saw this soap opera years ago when it first came out and was so excited that it finally came out on dvd only to be disappointed at how chopped up it was. The very bad editing takes away the dramatic feel of this great soap opera. I would not recommend to buy.
3,The power of positive thinking,It said would be large print! It was not! I can read better and be more happy with large print! Thank you!
1,Why bother?,"I was given one of these so I could use a PS/2 keyboard with my laptop. I thought I had a defective keyboard because keypresses were getting dropped. I would type the word ""TYPEWRITER"" and get ""TPEWITER,"" which is very, very frustrating. I switched to a different keyboard, but got the same result. The keyboard would also appear to stop working, which turned out to be a stuck CTRL key, or other keys would stick. This was on two perfectly fine keyboards. Finally, I went out and bought a real USB keyboard, ViewSonic BM-KU-206, for about $14, and all my problems disappeared. The only conclusion is that this adapter doesn't work very well. Because you can buy the same keyboard I bought for $1-2 more, the question is why would you bother with this adapter?"
2,Somewhat Useful...,"This was not what I expected! I can use some parts, but overall, not the investment I thought it would be!"
4,"Great game, buy it!","This game is great, I bought it not here but at a local gamestop, i bought it over live, because i did some research on it, and lots of gaming sites and user reviews says its better than live in anyways, it doesnt have like 3point and dunking allstar stuff like live has, but the street features is awesome, from playing 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 5v5! Overall when you are used to playing the live series it will fell really weird compared to live series but when you get used to get, its a hell-ah keeper."
1,Terrible printing with writing inside,"This is simply a printing of a public domain book available on Google books. The text has writing in it and there are pages that are illegible. I do not encourage you to purchase this book. Instead, get the less expensive and much better printing done by Red River Books."
3,Cetaphil,Cetaphil is nice but the other item I bought at the same time is spectacular. This product compareswell with Eucerin and is one of the products recommended by my dermatologist.
5,Outstanding,"Nylund does it again! This follow-up to First Strike is greater than ever and keeps me eager for further adventures of blue team, Dr.Halsey, and the Spartan-IIIs. This book shows an amazing journey of Kurt and is state of mind during the story. The story definitely feels like a Halo story and is reminiscent of the game and shows an amazing background of things occurring during Halo 2. The backstory of the Forerunners also gives me a hint of the mischievous plot unfolding in the upcoming Hal 4.5 stars!"
5,Get This Book!,"If like/love Halo, pick this book up. Couldn't put the book down. I read it in two sittings."
3,Nylund is slipping,Overall good story.........but the build up with to the climax of the story as a whole never seems to end. I like Nylunds writing style though.
4,"A bridge from Halo 2 to 3; does a great job, but ""middle"" books are always a step down","This was a great book. Don't get me wrong on that. It's just that it's not as good as the other ones in the series such as The Flood and my personal favorite, The fall of Reach. This book has a lot of action and exciting scenes, but isn't as good as the others because there are many, many unfinished stories (to be completed by Halo 3 the game). If you have read the other ones, ever played a modern video game or even have a passing interest in action or sci-fi; you have to read this book! (After you read the ones before it, of course!)"
2,Not the best halo book,"For a fan of the halo universe, is a book you must reed so you dont mis any detail, but if you have read the fall of reach or first strike, this book will be very poor and boring.I expected the return of the master chief and the invasion to earth, but it just mention this in about 4 or 6 pages, the hole book is about a diferent story with new spartans. The start is good but it gets worse every page.If I have to rate all 4 Halo books, this will be the order:1.-First Strike (awesome 5 stars)2.-The Fall of Reach (excelent start 4 stars)3.-The Flood (a bump between two excelent books)4.- Ghosths of Onyx (not the best book of all four)"
3,HALO goes generic...,"I loved Eric Nylund's other two HALo novels, but this one just wasn't as engrossing. I don't play the game, nor should that matter in a reading experince of a sci-fi novel.This felt more like playing a game than reading a hardcore sci-fi military adventure yarn. Unfortunately not as gripping as Eric's past two novels."
4,Not as good as the first Halo novels,"This book was well-worth the read; exciting, fun, and enjoyable, but it just didn't come close to the first three Halo novels. It was a tad bland in parts, and hard to fall in love with considering the lack of the Master Chief, but all in all, it was a good science fiction novel and I recommend it to any Halo fan."
5,A Must Read,I don't read many sci-fi books so if I do it has to be good. This is the best sci-fi book I've ever read. Finished it in 2 1/2 days. I'm getting the other three to read now.
2,Poor effort,"Mr. Nylund is a fantastic writer, I won't argue that for a moment. The first three books in this series were fantastic, but this recent installment is mediocre at best. The first thing I am wondering is if there was any editing done on this book. The spelling and grammatical errors are numerous, to say the least. At one point they refer to a female character as a he and then a she--in the same sentence. Very sad.There are about five different plot lines running through the book, and it just makes it seem choppy and laborous to get through. I'm not sure what effect they were going for with it all, but they didn't pull it off. The overall plot was good, but the numerous errors and choppy storyline just left me cold."
4,"I guess you'll just have to buy it, or be green with envy!","Since none of these songs are available on iTunes, you will just have to buy this CD! If you want to have songs like Call me, Call me (by Steve Conte) or other hits from Yoko Kanno from the show (Cowboy Bebop) you'll just have to go to YouTube!"
5,The definitive book on DB2,"This is by far the best book on DB2 and all versions from 3 to 5. Highly Recommended reading for everyone using DB2, from DBAs to Client/Server Developers. The only reason I did not rate this book a 10 was there could be more information on developing and designing parallel queries in Version 4 and 5."
1,Junk at best,"I've had this phone system for three years. After the first year I had to replace the rechargable battery; it just wouldn't hold a charge. Now the replacement barely holds the charge. I'm in a position whether to buy a second wireless phone with it or spend more money to replace the entire system. Probably the latter, even though that will cost me $200+., rather than $100 for an additional phone."
4,Great product,"I bought the base and two handsets three years ago and have since bought two additional handsets. I love this product. Speakerphone in the handset is a great innovation. Intercom is wonderful. We don't have to yell for each other all over the house now. Yeah, the batteries aren't the best (I've replaced all four just now after two/three years) but they do hold a charge out of the cradle overnight. So big deal, put the handset back in the cradle! Great answering machine and conference feature."
2,Highly over priced,This product is highly over priced. Will look for a lower price with the nest purchase. I have been purchasing this product for a number of years.
3,So so college football record book,"Somewhat disapointed in this book for the amount of errors found in records,didn't anyone proof read this book?????"
2,A Few Detailed Facts Are Wrong!,"The book is a good reference but not as accurate as the Internet or Google today. For example, the book has the wrong information on what College actually put numbers on Football Jerseys. According to the History of American Football and Sports Illustrated in 1908, Karl Davis, at the time publicity man for the University of Pittsburgh, first put numbers on college football jerseys.Davis used that good old sales pitch, ""One cannot tell the players without a program!"" He quickly added to this service the refinement of switching the numbers each week due to Davis having the program concession. Davis thus became a double pioneer in player numbering and in ""dynamic obsolescence"". Both inventions have come a long way since.When I see such errors, I wonder how many other facts the author got it wrong or just did sloppy research. Anyway, the Internet Age has made such books obsolete and mistakes unimportant since they can be corrected easily today with easy research."
3,Losing faith in TV on DVD,"I'll keep it short. Let's face it. Barney Miller's first two seasons were the weakest, especially the first. The wife doesn't even fit into the stories, and it is obvious this dimension was forced. If printing stops after season two, my review will drop from three stars into the negatives. If a series is committed to DVD, do it RIGHT, and do it COMPLETELY."
5,DVD TV,"I bought season one long time ago, now bought season two. I now remember it on TV growing up. Still good and funny."
2,Yawn...,"I don't know how this guy managed to make insects boring, but he did. Also, his prose is not at all engaging."
1,Uneducated consumer,"I wish I had done my research on this phone and read all these reviews. We bought the phone about 8 months ago. Within 6 weeks, we had static on the line almost every time we used the phone. Sometimes the static begins immediately and other times you have a 10 minute grace period to talk before it begins. Also, this static often occurs when people are leaving messages on the answering machine. This causes us to lose half the message as it is not understandable. This phone SUCKS. Do NOT buy it!"
1,Worst machine on the market,"I'm on my 2nd system. Within 2 months of the first one, the keypad did not work all the time. The 2nd current one goes on the fritz and asks my callers to enter the security code. Technical support tells me I need to unplug and replug the machine in. This problem has occurred twice. I go away for a month and it stopped taking messages from callers. No the mailbox was not filled. Yes it is working again but I don't trust it and signed up for Verizon voice mail.Stay away from this system!"
2,Got Vonage? Dont buy this,"If you got 2 lines, 1 hardwired (telco) and the other a voip, like vonage. The caller id will not work. I troubleshooted this issue for 3 hours now, and its clear that if you have a device such as Vonage connected to the 2nd line and your telco to the other, caller id will not work. It does work if either one is connected but the other isnt"
2,AT & T Model 2462,"The voice quality is GREAT. The answering system, cuts off messages. AT&T support is terrible. Sent replacement...it failed also...sent upgrade model E2562, (with wrong remote units - which had be returned for the correct ones)...now line one is disconnected when put on hold to answer line two. It has been 10 months of dealing with a very poorly run customer service department."
2,Not the greatest Product!,"For a small business, this not your phone to use. The ring types are aweful!!! Too loud and piercing for an office. When you are on line 1, you must hang up the phone to pick up line 2. Who does that nowadays! My old corded 2-line phone is better than this!! At least, the voice mail works!"
5,Like new,I love the book even though it seems like being used for more than 3 times. It's also really cheap!
5,America: A Concise History,I was very pleased with the book. I had no problems whatsoever and it arrived right away. I would definitely recommend the sender to anyone looking for similar products!
4,Concise book,"This book was required in my US history class, it is loaded with information it took a while for me to read it but it beats having to carry around a heavy hardcover history book."
5,Fan,Danelle Harmon is a true master of the pages. I crave more of her books and long for these to last forever!
4,The Beloved One,"An easy enjoyable read. I went back in time to an adventure that had historical, funny and sexy bits of great characters. I enjoyed all The De Montforte Brothers and their challenges."
4,Enjoyable Reading,"This is the second book in the trilogy. I did enjoy it, but not as much as the first book-The Wild One."
4,Good book,I liked this one. But it is in a series of books so you will prob want them all so you can keep going with the stories.
5,Just as good as the first!!!,"I was going to skip this one and go ahead to the last one ""The Wicked One"" since I love the older brother, Lucien. I am so glad, though, I decided to go in order. I can't say I like one story more than the other because they are completely different personalities and situations and I loved them both. There were some instances were I questioned how easily some of the circumstances could have been fixed with just some more questioning, but I guess for the story to develop it was necessary. Like the first one, I had to read it all at one time. I love this time period so I am so glad to discover Danelle Harmon as a writer of such stories. I am immediately going on to read the next brother's story."
2,Can't understand all of the good reviews,His depression was depressing. Yes...I know why he was down and I get it...but not my best means of escaping reality. As a person currently battling depression it was not a good time to read it. It seemed to drag on and on...even the sex scenes. Not even sure I want to read the next two and I have liked Lucien from the get go.The reality of the expected plot that was built up in the prior book was a total let down. Could have been a lot better.
2,nothing new,"There is absolutely nothing special about this cd. It's simply a rehash of 5 of their songs. I don't understand why it was released.I will say that the version of ""joy"" is nice, but I don't think that it alone is worth 10 bucks."
1,MacMarine,"I have read both this book and the Arizona Sniper. I was there and I am mentioned in the book and also several pictures of me is included. I feel that John's memory doesn't match mine. The fights are real, but the way he makes it like he was the hotshot, no way I remember John to be a little less eager for combat than what he protrays. There was some supicions about a couple of his purple hearts also. I was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart with H 2/5. I know that I never put him on point after sniper school as he indicates. I served with this unit from Jan 67 till Feb 68 and then with B 1/1 in 70 and 71. I also understand that in order for the book to sell he had too liven it up! John as a PFC or LCpl would never have been told of things and plans that he indicates in this book."
3,Good price but not alot of punch!,"I paid $12.99 with free shipping. The polisher is nice but it doesn't provide alot of power. If you just need a basic car polisher and dont mind following up the detail with a soft cloth, this polisher may be what you are looking for."
1,Not useful,"This software is not helpful, every chapter has only 10-12 very simple questions, you can easily find more on internet for free.Go to find a good biology book, if you really want to learn something."
5,"Wonderful, Groovy, Hip!","I have been an SOS fan since, well, since the band was formed. Having heard all of their songs, I was somewhat reticent to pick up a cd of songs that I had already heard. In any event, I headed up to the Virgin Megastore on Sunset Blvd anyway, pulled only by my love of the band. All I can say is, yes, I've heard these tracks before, but not quite like this! Swirling melodies, resonating rhythms and jazzy, happiness-filled harmonies abound in this lovely live work. Most amazing to me is the fact that Corinne's voice sounds the same as it did during the original recordings. Yep, they've still got it, alright.What else can I say? Corinne, you are a goddess! And Andy is THE urban gypsy. Can't wait for new work from SOS.a soul defector in LA"
1,Worst sound quality ever!,"I don't know if I have a freak pressing, but my CD sounds like a bad FM station with hiccups and blank spots. I tried to contact the record company, but no reply. I will probably return it to Amazon for another copy. Has anyone else had this problem? Outside of the sound quality, the concert itself sounds great as far as songs are concerned. Maybe the Japanese version is the one to buy."
5,"The Very Best Of Buck Owens, Vol.1",If you love Buck Owens this CD has all his favorites. I bought this as a gift but the person I bought it for said she loved it and it was one of her favorite CD's.
2,Bland arrangements,"I want to start by saying I really love Duck Baker's work...he's a fine player. The book doesn't seem to reflect his abilities. I felt the arrangements were very simplistic and not interesting or memorable. He could have done more to vary chord voicings and use alternate tunings. I returned this book, but it could be this book appeals more to beginner fingerstyle players."
5,"Fast-paced, really fun book!","Most of the professional reviewers missed the boat on this one. Great dialog, quirky characters, and just enough sex made this a great way to spend a few airplanes rides. I'm ordering his other work, Bone In The Throat, right now!"
2,disappointing,There must be a story here but it is hidden behind so many irrevelant details. Bourdain reminds me of a 7th grade boy seeing how many dirty words he can get away with using.
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Bourdain. Love his show and his books. I thought Bone in the Throat was a great read -- light, funny, good plot, interesting characters. The protagonist here is interesting -- but he's the only one. It's hard to tell the difference between the two main female characters. And there's simply too many shoot out scenes that drag on and on. Bourdain apparently has a great knowledge of automatic weapons, but ... who cares? That's not why I like him. He is, of course, a great stylist and the writing is as sharp as ever. The problem is what he's writing about. It didn't interest me in the least."
3,Seemed to center more on fairies having sex than on a plot.,"I've read previous works by Sandra Davidson and enjoyed them. However, ""The Enchanting"" seems to be different in a few ways and not all of them good. I enjoyed the plot concerning Valor's misgivings about Raena and whether or not she was using her powers to enchant him but it seemed that regardless of the plot the story always came back to fairy's copulating with humans. These interludes didn't always seem to flow with the plot. The love story between Valor & Raena would have been enchanting if some of these scenes hadn't detracted from it."
2,Purchase a different book on the same subject.,"The book has its interesting parts.Though be aware of the anti male sentiment that revolves through out the piece, it appears that the author was a co-pilot at one time and carries a rather large chip about the past.I am a 36 year actively flying Commercial pilot and do not see the (specifically male issues) that this portrays to be true.Other than that it is a relatively good read.Though there are many many other books written without the bitterness that truly give the facts.Gary"
1,Dead one in 3 months,"I am very dissapointed with this monitor. It was dead in 3 months.I was giving this brand a try and I sould have not done it. I always buy ViewSonic, but against my better judgement I bought this one. Bad move. Avoid!"
1,"No DVI, flimsy.","This monitor lacks DVI inputs, which is contrary to what is indicated on this page. This means it cannot be used with many of today's video cards, and I cannot use it in my systemThe monitor also feels very flimsy and wobbles like a weeble, except unlike the weeble it feels as if it may fall down."
2,"sold as new, but was used and repackaged",Title says it all. One thing I did not pay attention to before buying is the length of the audio cables. My receiver is a good 6 feet from the tv. Had to go by coupler extensions.
3,"""Golden Throats"" Goes Country","Certain artists never should sing country music. Louis Armstrong and Carol Channing come to mind. On the other hand, there are many noted performers who simply should not sing. Leonard Nimoy, Goldie Hawn and Jack Palance remain standouts in this particular category. If you want celebrity vocal prowess, look no further than ""Golden Throats 3: Sweet Hearts of Rodeo Drive."" Along with these aforementioned entertainers, you get mind-boggling rarities such as Merv Griffin's ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" Telly Savalas' ""I Walk the Line"" and Lorne Greene's French interpretation of ""Ringo."" Order now - operators are standing by!"
1,If There Was Half A Star,"It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together. I only made it about half way into the book. There are many better books out there."
5,Great service; Got exactly what I paid for.,"Quick review - Received exactly what I needed. On time. In great condition. No problems. After I sent order in, I e-mailed account to see if there was anyway to ship product sooner. I received a reply in a very timly manner with accurate information that helped me make my decision if the extra expense was worth it to come in a few days earlier. Everything about transaction was easy and effortless."
1,"Surfing, surfing trips","The top of the line in surfing movies so far has been ""Step Into Liquid""; if you haven't seen this yet - skip this movie and go straight to Boardwalk.This has some surfing in it - and a lot of wierd in betweens of the surfing culture as this group saw it - but it was a lack luster production through and through. I felt like was used to help finance their little voyage - with not much in return but, "". . . yea Man, wasn't that a cool set of waves . . . "" type dialogue for an hour or so.Thumbs down. Get ""Step Into Liquid"" - a cross cultural, superior production."
2,Who is this book for?,"I purchased a copy of this book because I've been buying nearly all of Lynn Margulis's books in preparation for teaching a course. The description here was minimal, and I wanted to warn other potential buyers -- this is basically a coloring book. The weird thing is that the concepts and vocabulary are at a first-year college or advanced high school level. I can't imagine just who is supposed to use this book, sixth grade geniuses with crayons, or easily amused college freshmen? I suppose if you have a really bright grade school class you might want to give this book a try, but in my judgement it's not at the right level for anyone, anywhere."
5,An innocent with a genetic love of her homeland,"A gripping, unforgettable work which made me laugh and cry, sometimes both at the same time. Written by a respected British journalist whose innocent genetic love for her country of origin takes her out to Iran where she makes heroic efforts to make the reality confirm her idealised image of what should be 'Persia'. Her individual and eccentric personality is rapidly sculpted, and honed, from within, to fit into an artificial entity called The Islamic Republic. It is from this perspective that she gives us a unique glimpse of a man-made state. A tragedy, on a personal and national level, from which she finally emerges with her innocence intact - to continue life in her natural dual state so well encapsulated in the endearing shortened version of her Persian name - nothing to do with a fruit!"
2,Something to read when you can't find anything else.,"First on the writing style. This book is extremely hard to read and difficult to follow because she skips around too much and gets off subject. One minute she's 30-something, next line she flashes back to age 10 with no warning. I am an American Muslim and I don't pretend to know everything that goes on the world, especially in Shia Iran. So I can't say if she is telling the truth or not but for God's sake why do you expect IRAN to be like UK? It makes no sence to me to complain about all the stuff that happened when it was HER own decision to go there, not once but TWICE. If it was too much to handle the fisrt time WHY GO BACK? I think she brought all her hardship on herself. Not every Muslim is going to be as strict as the next. If you can't handle it, find a more laidback environment and live the kind of life you want. Don't go to one of the strictest countries (Shia/Islam-wise) and expect the country to change for you. AHHHHHH!"
3,"A BIT OVER THE TOP , BUT BETTER THAN EXCAVATION","Ok, I love adventure books, especially the Lincoln child andDouglas Preston novels. Their books have a real life quality with high tech gadgets, with a bit of mystery thrown in.Sorry to say the Rollins story was a bit over the top on this one, dinosaurs in caves, a long lost tribe never discovered in all this time and to top it off, our hero has clues from a ghost who helps the hero out.I mean, The Relic had a monster, but at least the possible explanation as to its existence was pretty well explained. Unfortunately Rollins method of a dash of monster and a pitch of ghost just didn't float my boat, but I had to finish the book because I always do. So sorry J.R. your books are not in the same league as Preston and Childs. But it did keep me somewhat entertained on my train ride home. So 3 stars to you."
4,"Fast, tight read, a quick dive to the earth's depths","The plot is fast, tight, and doesn't waste time bringing you down into the earth's bowels. Its subject matter - caves and the 'creatures' that 'dwell within' - is fairly new, and quite absorbing. The structure of the story is reminiscent of Jurassic Park / Micheal Crichton.However, as an amateur spelunker, I found the treatment on the scientific basis of the story very light. Mr. Rollins could have elaborated more on the development of caves, the different rock formations, etc. to add ""meat"" to his novel. I was hoping to find more descriptive passages about the underworld, its origins, and so on.Some of the characters could use further development (Ben/Ashley) but otherwise are quite satisfactory in keeping up with the story's tight pace. A salutory first effort!! I'd like to see more of Mr. Rollin's future works, most especially if they're about caves."
5,Couldn't put it down,I finished this book in a matter of hours. I couldn't put it down. The whole idea of an underground civilization is incredible (Yes I have seen other books and stories that do it but not at this level.) I especially enjoyed how he showed the symbiotic relationship between the creatures and the natives. A must read.
3,Spelunking Anyone?,"Not the best book I've ever read but a really fun read. You actually feel that you're down there scurrying around with the characters. You do get caught up and ""have to finish it."" Recommend it for a light, enjoyable read."
2,"Uninteresting, poor writing that lacks research","I really wanted to like Subterranean, but the writing is poorly constructed, the characters lack any complexity, and there are many nuances in the story that display lack of research. For instance, Ben, and Australian cave guide, sometimes has an Aussie accent and colloquialisms in his speech and sometimes he speaks with American expressions and speech. Additionally, it is irritating when the author does not refer to the proper rank structure for the navy and marine corps. There are no privates or majors in the navy or marine corps, for instance, yet the story presents this. For all of the minor irritating factors about the narrative, the story is just not that compelling to read. It is a shame, for I love adventure stories. I would avoid this book like the plague. Instead, look toward Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Riptide and the Pendergast novels are superb thriller/action fiction reads."
3,"Good, but it seemed like I was reading Excavation again","This was a good book, and if I read it prior to reading Ecavation, I would have thought that this book was GREAT (like I thought about Excavation). But by reading Excavation first, I was dissapointed. I thought I was reading the same book again. My advice read one then take a long break to ""Cleans your Pallet"" then pick up the other book."
3,Subterranean's Maze,"It is quite apparent that James Rollins is an excellent storyteller. His descriptions are excellent. I read the book in two sittings. My frustration is that the time lapses felt unrealistic. As well, the group of experts would have been carefully researched before such a mission. The real Khalid's family would have surely known something bad had happened--or was this a family coverup? Major faux pas. The Major's brother just happens to be the only survivor of the previous mission-- too convenient. Rollins maneuvered the story a bit too much for me. Still a fun read."
2,SUBTERRANEAN WAS SO........... SUBPAR AND BORING !,"WARNING: This adventure was so boring. I struggled with the first 180 pages, and I had to let it fly to the trash can. I guess some people loved it. It was not worth it in my opinion. I would say that when the first book, of an author, does not come out in hard back first, the publisher does not have confidence in the product. I may say, at first, this book was moving along. It kept my interest all the way up to page 133. The main character, Ashley, the team leader, was doing very well. Then all of a sudden, JR made the adventure go deep underground. It dragged, and dragged. Weak characters blew it for this book. I understand JR next book will be EXCAVATION; due out JULY 2000. I will not look for this book guys. His new one will have to drop in my lap at the book store.Last words to you is, "" borrow SUB from your buddy,""."
1,"Trashy, and not in a good way","While the plot of this book was for the most part decent popcorn reading (aside from a few plot holes), the main characters were rather stereotypical, lacking depth, and nearly moronic. I suppose this particularly applies to the female characters. One goes from the standard strong, intelligent, motherly persona to simplistic love-struck schoolgirl at the flick of a switch, while the other plays your ridiculously stereotypical ditsy obtuse damsel in distress (think Denise Richards in the James Bond flick ""The World Is Not Enough""). I wasn't expecting this book to be particularly cerebral reading, but really?I was tempted to stop reading after what little bit of character development there was in the first third or so of the book (to give it a fair chance), and only continued on out of curiosity for the plot, which I suppose says something about that aspect.Or I was just bored, and didn't want to feel like I wasted the few dollars the book cost."
2,First 180 pages were good...but....,"I liked the 1st 180 pages of this book as pure escapist entertainment. The setting was interesting and I thought the author did a good job of putting the reader into it. The characters were at least adequate for the escapist nature of the book. But then...the author went of the deep end with some pretty hokey ESP stuff, and from then on I just couldn't buy any of the developments(unfortunately, I had already bought the book.) I also found it a bit disturbing that the author glossed over the marsupial-to-aboriginal Australians connection."
5,Great for class lectures,"I use this recorder exclusively for class lectures and could not be happier. Most important feature I was looking for was clarity in a large room. I was very impressed with the sound quality. The recorder does not have to be anywhere near the professor to pick up their voice perfectly! I bought one of the cheaper sony recorders first, it was about $50, and returned it because the sound quality was terrible. For me this one is worth the money because I am recording from a distance. It's also very compact and easy to use. Definitely recommend it for students!"
4,"Good, But Not a Best Effort","This CD contains but 2 songs. They are good but certainly not the best produced by this wonderful group. You can't be ""best"" every time.Both songs are evocative of the ""medieval style"" for which they are justly renown but both are thoroughly modern as well. The first, ""I'll be there"", is a bit of a love song. The second, ""Down at the Ole Mill Inn"" is a drinking song. Both are good songs. Both are well executed. Neither will go onto my favorites playlist."
2,Item is sent with a dead battery,"I can't do a full review at this time as the unit was sent with a dead battery. I don't understand why they bother to send the unit with a battery at all. ?? In the instructions, it states that ""The battery should be replaced immediately with a CR2032 lithium cell.""Why bother to put one in at all if we also have to order a battery along with the unit?"
3,Not Impressed,"The item is very simple, it tells the temperature. It does not have a laser pointer as the others I've used to it is hit and miss on what you're pointing towards. It works well but is too small and plain."
3,Shop somewhere else!,"For the price I paid, I would have expected more.I also ordered another, more expensive product which I never recieved. It is excrutiatingly hard to find anyone that has any qualifications let alone one that could possibly help you.Amazon.com is the biggest ripoff. For the love of all things human, shop somewhere else."
4,Good product,You can put it into Celsius measurements which is useful as well. Simple and easy to use. Useful tool for any home mechanic
3,"OK, but somewhat inconsistent","This is a fairly neat gadget, but the accuracy is somewhat inconsistent. Three or four readings in exactly the same place within a few seconds of each other yield varying readings. If you're looking for a rough estimate of the temperature this will give it to you. If you're looking for accuracy, you probably need something else."
3,"adequate for now, but I will need another","Bought this item for measuring food temps when cooking. Battery lasts well. Seems accurate although I have really yet to test it with anything well calibrated. Only problem I encountered is the temp range it is sensitive to, not wide enough for some of the applications (barbecue, brick oven). otherwise, good purchase."
1,Hardly Useable,"This cheap plastic peice of junk is really not worth its small pricetag. It takes literally 30 seconds to change tracks, it has a horrible interface, and despite the pictures, it is actually much larger in your hand than it would appear. It features horrible audio quality and comes with the worst sounding earbuds I have ever heard. Stear well clear. This is one purchase you will regret."
4,Solid MP3 Player for the Price,Excellent Item. I use mine while working out and walking to my classes. It is absolutely ideal. It was very easy to add and delete files. The only downfall of the 256mb iTouch is the headphones. I HIGHLY recommend buying a seperate pair because the factory ones will make your music sound terrible! The player itself rates right up there with my IPOD.
1,DO NOT BUY,"After a whole bunch of emails to tech support to figure out how to get my music on the mp3 player, it worked fine... and i was happy... or so i thought.... the battery life is more like 4 hours per battery, and 31 days after i bought this, it broke.... it won't work, and after a week of emailing tech support, i still have yet to receive a response... and amazon.com will not accept a return on this product because it was more than 30 days... DO NOT BUY THIS!!! It's a waste of money. find something better"
1,Did NOT work in my car!,"I just had a baby July, so our infant seat did not come with latch, so when I saw this product I was thrilled. However my mood was greatly changed when I tried to use this product. I own new Sabb 93, 2001, and this product did not work in my car. The latch, latched onto my car wounderfully, but when it came to getting it tight enough to scure the base of the infant seat, it FAILED!!!! My base is more scure with the seat belt! I belive this product needs more work!"
1,Disappointing,"Both my brother and I bought the book/tapes and were severely disappointed with the quality. Errors were not edited out, and the accent/pronunciation was very poor according to all the native Telugu speakers to whom we showed the product. Amateurish and overpriced."
5,Buy multiple copies -- you'll be giving them out!,"Indispensable for both natives and transplants. Absolutely the best analysis of the Southern mindset that I have ever encountered -- I'm a native -- and a dangerously funny read to boot. Ms. King writes with a caustic wit wrapped in an ever-so-delicate velvet glove. I quote her insights often, and almost always end up having to get yet another copy to give to someone. The South really has its own flavor -- from Faulkner to Foxworthy -- and Florence King has it all neatly summed up. Everything I have read of hers so far is worthwhile."
3,okay,3 stars for great price and free shipping. this stuff didn't really numb but I'm guessing its for the cherry flavor part of it. I dont use this product anymore.
4,Well Done,Works pretty well. Seems to resist smells and stays exactly where you wrap it around your arm. You can also take the arm wrap off and slide it around a belt if you're walking to class or something like that. No problems getting to the click wheel through the plastic.
1,King of the Lost World,"See A.D. Lawlor's review for a plot synopsis. Having first read guestar57's glowing 5 star review, coupled with the fact that Bruce Boxleitner (one of my favorite TV actors) was one of the stars, lead me to buy this film on DVD. Having a love for most fantasy, monster and horror films for over 50 years, my bottom line review of this film is: I literally threw out the DVD after watching the film (rather than make someone else suffer by buying it used)! The derivative plot and horrible CGI make this the reigning king of the worst lost world movies ever made."
1,One of the charging bays doesn't work,"One of the charging bays always indicates that the batteries in the bay are not in working condition. I'm also getting unusual behavior from the other indicators.I tried the 15-minute Energizer charger, and I'm having problems with this unit as well (see my review for that charger). Frankly, I'm done wasting my time with Energizer chargers now. I've never had these types of problems with other chargers in the past."
5,great product,We hooked this up on our boat and it works great. It is easy to change between using an ipod or going back to radio/cd.
3,A below par Follett novel,"This story is good, but certainly not up to Mr. Follett's usual tales of suspense and intrigue. There was too much emphasis on the romantic interest in the story which bogged the plot line. The environmental terrorist concept was chilling and could have been better developed.It is difficult to believe that a seasoned FBI agent would let her personal feelings intefere with a serious investigation.Mr. Follett usually writes great stories but this was not one of them."
1,Follett's Worst Offering To Date,"This is the least inspiring offering by Follett since ""The Big Needle"" in 1978. It is poorly conceived and poorly written. It contains the earmark characters that appear in most Follett adventures, now in the guise of aging American hippies. It is obvious the author knows little about American culture, despite claiming a great deal of research. The writing sounds like an English secondary student musing about whay life must be like in America. It is difficult and exasperating to read. I would avoid it and I am usually a fan of the author's work."
1,This does not measure up to Follett's other novels!,I agree with the other reviewers. This book was dreadful. I am a big Follett fan and consider him one of my favourite authors. Not any more!!
1,"Can I give this a ""0""?","What trash this is!You might expect this of Ludlum, but of Follett?I don't know who phoned this is for Mr. Follett, but he needs to write his own story next time. His readers deserve better!"
3,A Bit Too Predictable,"Hammer was recommended to me by some one with fairly similar literary tastes. I have never been a big fan of Follet except for Pillars of the Earth which I thought was inventive, unpredictable and had closure. I almost feel that Folloet is getting ready to write an FBI serial with this book. The topic is a bit far out. It would have been better if he could have included sound scientific evidence that this was a plausible plot. He didn't. Making an illiterate time warped hippie the nemesis of the FBI and having him always a step in front of them even to the end is a hard sell. Unlike James Patterson where his nemesis , Sonegi, is a cerifiable genius and wacko. Preist is just a wacko. I began to believe he cultivated four leaf clover instaed of grapes. I would loke to see Follet return to the Pillars genre."
2,Hammer of Eden,Some of the characters are ok but the story line was really dragged out and not very beivable. Hard to beleive that Follett wrote this one!
3,cecilee,not what I would have expected from kenSo different to what I am used toA bit soapie!What I would call a Woman's Weekly Read!
2,"!Yea this guy is a fruit cake!""",My response to this review is that I disagree with this person's review. I think that even though California may be earthquake country that there is no reason why anyone could create earthquakes. The book is not fast but it isn't slow but on the other hand I don't think it is thought out. The book doesn't really allow you to use your own imagination it tells the story in to much detail so that the readers can't think for themselves. I don't think that what happened in this book can actually happen in real life because sending something down into the earth to create and earthquake is fictional and just can't happen. Its not really a good book since it does show how terrible terrorists can be and since these people are from the U.S. it is even worse to know that these people are in the states. I just think overall this is a bad
4,Excellent tale of a hippy turned terrorist.,"From the first chapter till the last, Ken Follett presents the reader with a somewhat frightening and very plausible scenario of a sixties leftover determined to preserve the commune lifestyle to which he has become accustomed. Priest, the central character, is the commune founder and chief protector. When a power plant plans to dam the valley on which the 'secret' commune resides, Priest will stop at nothing to assure its continued existence. With the aid of a siesmologist, also a member of the commune, a plan arises in which manually produced earth-quakes will be used as a tool to force the authorities to stop the construction of the dam. Priest uses anything at his disposal to accomplish his task, from murder to mayheim. Follett never allows the reader to sleep, a true page-turner from beginning to end."
1,Not worth while,"I am a big fan of Follett's books. He writes some wonderful books, and he writes some reliable page turners. Unfortunately, he also writes a few duds. This is one of the duds."
1,The novel equivalent of a stale Big Mac eaten in a hurry.,"After the magnificence of Pillars of the Earth, the pretty-goodness of Eye of the Needle, and the not-badness of several of his other novels, this one is clearly at the bottom of the heap. The story and characters are ridiculously implausible. It is the kind of thing that reads as if it were hatched by an author who found himself with a one-week deadline to write a book, and had to do so while on a skiing vacation in Aspen (would that I had such a life). It is formulaic to the point that it feels a bit like stuffing oneself with a stale Big Mac while driving in rush hour traffic (not that I've ever done that). Neither tasty nor satisfying, and certainly not memorable. After a string of Follett novels, this one made me leap for someone new. I'm trying Ethan Canin."
1,"From the same pen which wrote ""Pillars""?","Even a great author can be forgiven a lapse in his normally outstanding work, but Ken, please, don't make it worse with quotes like ""This is my best book so far"" (from his website). The book was difficult to finish, and I wish I hadn't. The plot tested credulity, descriptions bordered on hyberbole, characters were developed poorly, and I found myself rooting for the bad guys. Come back, Ken, come back."
2,And this guy wrote Pillars of the Earth?,"Follett has followed a dreadful ""The Third Twin"" with a book almost as bad. Some of the previous reviews are correct, this reads like a movie for television. The plot is laughable and completely unbelievable(and I grew up in LA). The FBI's new boyfriend tags along with machine-gun-toting G-Men in a helicopter chase? Give me a break."
5,Great for Lecture recording!,I use this to record my literature and philosophy lectures and it works pretty well! A smart choice!
5,great bra,I love this bra. It fits well and provides great support. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Bustier
5,Perfect strapless bra,"I have searched high and low for a great strapless bra. For those who are more endowed, it is hard to find good support without having the sides of a long line bra buckle. When looking for undergarments on my wedding day, many people recommended this bra to me. It was perfect. I felt completely supported and had no fears while wearing my strapless gown. In addition, the back sits a bit lower so you don't have to worry about it showing in the back. I loved this bra so much, I got one in black too. I have worn these bras several times and haven't had any problems with them breaking. Tons of brides recommended this bra to me, and I am glad they did."
4,Iron Bra,"I have 2 of these strapless bras...they will hold up 5 tons of brick and an army.They do give you bullet-boobs though so you may look a bit ""Mad Men""-ish.The guys probably won't care though.Bought this one for my 70-year-old mom and it held her up like an 18-year-old."
2,Cups way too big,I bought this to go under my wedding dress. I was really hopeful that it would work out because of the reviews and this was going to be the second bustier I tried. I decided to go with a band size bigger and a cup size smaller like others had mentioned to do. The band fit great but the cups were way too big I am normally a DD and I got a D and it was way too big. It also fit really funny I don't know but something just wasn't right. None the less I had to return it and I hope to find something for my wedding.
2,"Disappointing, but still worth a look","I have to agree with those who have criticized this book. Cooper seems to think that EVERYTHING is wrong in typical UI design, and the somewhat haphazard way he goes about presenting his criticisms and solutions fails to form a cohesive argument. High expecations were not fulfilled. Nonetheless, there were some very intriguing concepts peppered throughout the book, and anyone who hasn't thought about UI design AT ALL will certainly benefit from reading it."
2,ole is bitter when it comes to THE MAN,Ole saying Flair is not a worker is a joke.....Ole sure could hold a headlock for ten minutes but Flair could keep eveyone on the edge of their seats for 60 minutes. Good to read some of the stuff but Ole wasn't accurate 100% of the time
3,Mornings on Horseback,"David McCullough did a tremendous job with his book: ""Truman!"" A must read! But, in ""Mornings on Horseback,"" he loses the reader at times in the details of events that are only of marginal importance to the life and development of this great statesman. I would rate the book ""good"" - but not ""great"" like Truman!"
3,"Liked it, but not on par with Truman and Adams....","McCullough is a great writer, but this book got too detailed on things I didn't really care about.....I love the history, and believe you should read this if the topic interests you, but Truman and Adams are 2 of the greatest and this one just doesn't measure up to those...."
2,It was very consistent. It was very consistent. It was ver,"I find McCullough's writing a bit intolerable. He uses the passive voice quite frequently. Too me, his work reads more like technical documentation rather than descriptive prose. Perhaps this is typical for biography but I do prefer the livelier writing style of Edmund Morris."
2,Simply Dull,I have not found this book to be bogged down in frivolous details that I could care less reading about.
4,Good general overview,I was able to take this book and apply what I had learned from it very quickly. It has also been a good help as a reference book.
2,Poorly done and dated,"Needing a book on HTML, I explored the jungles of Amazon. Kept seeing this title referenced in reviews of other's so decided to check it out. Ordered the book. It's very poorly done. It's outdated. I'm sending it back and shopping for another. There's something fishy in Denmark here:-("
2,Not recommended,"The folks at Amazon Books really need to investigate the reviews on this page. As for the book itself, it offers a lot, however, most of the chapters are not even written by Stanek! In trying to cover too much, the book fails miserably in that it does not cover each element thoroughly. I would recommend it as a door stop!"
5,Keep this book next to your computer!,"Anyone looking to learn mainstream HTML and Web publishing MUST get this book. I don't know how or why you would try to publish for the Web and not have this book. The book provides a detailed road map for developing intranet and WWW sites. this book covers all the angles. It will help you firmly establish your understanding of publishing. It begins with publishing basics moves on to advanced layout and design, graphics and multimedia, scripting and interactivity, advanced programming with Java and ActiveX, and web site administration. I bought 2 copies 1 for the office and 1 for home!"
3,"Good reference book, but not very complete examples.",I am a learn by example type of guy. The book should include some case studies and full complete implementations using this guy's suggestions. You have to have a degree in library research to find things in this tome.
2,Do NOT waste your money on this book.,I am also glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of paying for it. The book has 1500+ pages of mostly fluff. It tries to do everying but doesn't do any one of them well. The old wise saying is true. If it sounds too good to be true it usually is.
1,Really Dreadful and Uninspiring,"When I purchased this album, I was hoping for something along the lines of Deep Forest. I was dissapointed. The songs on Apurimac II all sound alike, not a single track posesses any kind of depth, the sound textures are plastic, and the melodies are trite. The track ""Quetzal's Feather"", in particular, sounds a lot like a cheesy 1980s TV show theme song. All in all, a thoroughly uninspiring album.Steer clear -- this is not what new age or ambient were meant to be."
4,Excellent collection,"For Sally Oldfield fans, this double CD set will be a good addition, particularly for those (like me) who were unable to find her releases on CD and had to settle with banged up LPs or used cassettes. Not all my favorite songs by Ms. Oldfield are on this anthology (it is missing Path with a Heart, Weaver, The Song of the Bow, and Meet Me in Verona) but it has the best and widest selection of tunes when compared to other Sally Oldfield ""best of"" CDs - including songs from her later Bronze albums, Playing in the Flame and Strange Day in Berlin. And - a big plus - the liner notes are extensive and informative."
4,Very Good Read,The book is interesting reading. The story does jump around a bit being told by different guys point of view but it's easy to follow.
5,Good Book,This book was very interesting; I could not put it down. However the ending left me a little unsatisfied. It was all crammed in at the end as if the author just wanted to finish the book.
3,Neotech Mega Bass Strap,This seems to be a decent strap for the money. It is not as nice as the Levy straps but doesn't cost near as much either. I wish it held the bass in position a little better but overall very workable and a good value.
4,Rudy's Gadget Bag,"If you've read Rudy's other works, you should get around to this one. It sat on my shelf for ten years at least before I finally got to it, during which time Rudy cranked out several more novels, in which he spins really fun stories using the technologies that he catalogs in this book. So for me, it's kind of like being a Trekkie and finding a catalog of Enterprise-era technology. It's essentially a cheery book, a merry march toward the endless future of trans-human existence. The biggest obstacles to the book are the marketing. The cover's stupid ugly. Spare parts? Sterling's foreword is weird. Why deflate the premise of the book before the reader gets to it? Neither essential nor thrilling, yet meaningful and enlightening. Memorable for Rudy's frank self-disclosure that attaining permanent sobriety is his greatest wish. Well, he may wish for it, but I'm glad he got lit."
4,Great CD.,I bought this CD for my son for Christmas. He is starting to discover bluegrass and this CD has so many great classic bluegrass songs.
5,appalachian stomp,Fantastic CD. It's the good ole music I grew up with. It was everything I was looking for in the CD. The shipping was very fast too!
1,Very Average Bluegrass CD,"Not Great sound quality, Look for a CD by a group called ""Shades of Grass"" if you like great Bluegrass music."
1,Dense!,"I received this book as a holiday gift and was so excited to begin reading it. Boy, was I disappointed. I must confess I barely made it past the first 100 pages. Bogle's efforts to include every single tidbit of information he researched actually succeeded in doing the impossible: making Dorothy Dandridge a boring subject. I hope to get back to the book one day and plow through it because Dandridge has always fascinated me but I'm not making any promises. I hope one day either a different author or Bogle himself will go through this book with a big blue pencil and edit this monster down to a reasonable, and interesting, size."
5,"Fairly complete, beautifully illustrated book","The story about how it all began and has become... Beutifully illustrated. To the point examples. Beautifully brought together! Easy to understand to people with not to much evolution knowledge. The only thing I missed were some geological aspects. Being so important in the beginning, I would like some more information about the lithosphere, its cycles, the physical and chemical (and later biological) erosion, and so on. But it is one of my favorites, I like it very much. It is what a good book should be: inventing, well made, good looking!"
5,"Excellent quality, fits Weber Q220 perfectly.",Very good quality cover. Fits the grill perfectly. Should last for awhile. The price at Amazon.com was excellent.
3,Why didn't this come with the grill?,"I mean, really. Its a vinyl cover.It is pretty well made, but how much did the grill cost? They couldn't throw in the cover?Shipping was twice the price of the cover itself."
2,Doesn't fit Weber Q220 grill,"Despite the label, neither my wife nor I could get this cover to fit neatly over our new Weber Q220 grill: It is simply a little bit too small. With much effort, we were able to force it over the grill (oriented 90 away from the picture), but even in that position, it does not fully cover the grill. And it is both difficult to put it on and to get it off."
1,Catholic Book for Children,"To be honest, I gave this item a low rating based on the condition it was in. The book wass poorly packed and had damage to corners. I can't rate the book itself as I returned the book as soon as possible and did not bother to look at it."
5,Nothing But Back To Back Classic,"Smooth Grooves: A Sensual Collection, Vol. 2 is a follow up to Volume 1, and like Volume 1, the CD is very constient with the classic slow jams, that may young folks were made of. Standout tracks include the classic and often sampled Tender Love. Other standout tracks include What You Won't Do For Love by Bobby Caldwell ,Come Go With Me by Teddy P and the always heartbreaking classics Am I Dreaming by Atlantic Starr and Fire & Desire by Rick James."
1,The Italian - Very disappointing,Big buildup to an even bigger let down. Just another Italian WANABEE.
2,A bit disappointing,"I found this CD okay but a bit boring. No songs captured my interest, and I've set the CD aside. Perhaps Patrizio can do better, but this CD is forgettable."
1,Sorry I Bought It,"I listened to parts of the first three cuts and then stopped. Now I'm looking for someone else to give it to.I bought this because I got a recommendation from Amazon telling me that ""people who bought Bocelli also bought this""... suffice it to say that this is nothing like anything Bocelli ever did or ever will do. It's more like a cheesy Engelbert Humperdick pizza songs collection. Yes, I know that Engelbert also has a following, but I just don't happen to be a member of that club.Look... Patrizio may well have his following too and that's terrific for him and for them, but this just wasn't at all what I exepcted and I don't think I will ever again give any of his music a second look. Good luck to Patrizio - I just don't happen to like his music and I won't be going back there."
5,Fantastic album all the way,"I was sitting in my local coffee shop on a lazy Sunday afternoon when I first heard Patrizio singing. I thought it was Engelbert initially, then Dean Martin and then Paul Anka, and was pleasantly surprised when i found out it was PATRIZIO BUANNE. I just loved his music and what a voice (Beautiful). I rushed to buy his CD the next day. I am very particular with my choice of music and artists as I like to listen to the true voice and Patrizio has definately got this gifted voice. I would also love to hear him singing in his native language although I don't understand any Italian. This is definitely an album for true music lovers."
1,No customer service,The speakers stopped working after 4 months and then the customer service was terrible. I couldn't get a hold of anyone. Don't buy unless you want your speakers to break and then not have anyone help you!
5,Everyone I have played the CD for Wants it.,"Heard the CD in International Records in Atlanta and had to have it. Never tire of listening to the refreshing beats. If you like Enigma -""MCMXC A.D."", Ostein Sevag's - Link or Ottmar Liebert's - 'Nouveau Flamenco"", you should like ""One thousand & One Nights""."
4,The best songwriter you never heard of,"I was referred this cd by a friend who described it just that way- the best songwriter you never heard of- the liner notes are worth the price of the cd. You can tell by the artists who performed Doc's songs how much he was respected. Shawn Colvins ""viva las vegas"" knocked me out."
2,It's a great song...,"Well, i am huge fan of Sarah's VOice, i have been since her days in cradle of filth, however this was a disappointing Album. The two songs to download on line are great, but that's the whole album. All the songs are very similar and you can pick up alot of over used styles. Sarah's voice is amazing, but she sings the same way in almost the same notes every song. It's a good album, it's just that it sounds like one long similar song."
4,Pretty Good,"I liked the variety of the messages and the speakers, it was a good mix, and gave me some proactive stuff to go away with and work on."
1,"Get me a gun,quick!","This has to be the most horrible piece of recorded ""music"" in the history of mankind. OOh, Michael Damian,baby,baby! The good news is it was only 26 minutes. The bad news- it seemed like 26 hours."
5,A Great CD! Massachussetts,"This CD is awesome. I love the show and so obivously, I love the CD. I think anyone who watches ""Saved By The Bell"" should get this sound track 'cause it's really good and it has all the songs from the show! My personal favorite? Friends forever!"
4,Classic R&B,"If you like classic R&B, this CD is for you. The title of the CD says it all. Grab your wine and your woman, throw on this CD and,...you get the idea."
4,Strong production and impressive vocals,Read the reviews and thought on the strength of them the album was worth buying. I was very impressed. I have been a fan from the very start back in 1980. It has been a chequered career to say the least - But HOME puts her back up there.And it is great to see Sheena co-producing the album.
4,A true gift for Movie lovers with some minor glitches,"This is an excellent compilation and movie fans will no doubt enjoy it very much. The liner notes alone are worth the price, but It would be perfect if only Rhino could have provided all the original performers: instead of Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen or Irene Cara, we get covers, in some cases by unknowns. Having said that, Paul Williams'take on his own ""Evergreen"" is sweet and unexpected and the bulk of the songs are the soundtrack versions."
4,Natural treatment concepts for sufferers of depression,"Finally! Depression explained in a manner which makes sense to those of us who have not yet earned a doctorate degree. A great source of references for the management of depression for those who prefer natural remedies v. synthetic medications. Anyone coping with depression/anxiety will appreciate the thorough explanation of causes and alternative treatment options for this illness. As a sufferer of depression and anxiety myself, I found the detailed explanations satisfyingly scientific yet not too overwhelming for the lay person. A friend lent me the first copy of this book: I intend to buy at least 4 more copies for my relatives and friends also coping with the symptoms of depression."
1,Blech,"ESPN 25 seems as if it were put together by a high school senior trying to do a quick job on a term paper. The prose and content make the book flow about as well as a lactose-intolerant person's colon after downing a double-thick milkshake and grilled cheese.The book is worthwhile only if you can get it for a steep discount, and even then only if the DVD is still intact."
1,Wrong bag delivered 2X,"I am sure that I would like the messenger bag, if that is what I received. Instead, I received the the Bumble Bags tote bag two times, despite my clarification with the returns customer service. If you want the messenger bag, order from a different service."
5,A Must Have,"Absolutely the best camp cookbook I have had yet. Recipes are simple and easy to understand. Ingredients can all be found at any supermarket, even small ones. The breakfast section alone is worth the price of the book.(These cooks really liked a big breakfast) The book is durable and there are enough recipes to last the average camper years before having to repeat a meal. Most meals will feed 4 to 6 easily and the additional stories, tips and photos are a great bonus!"
3,camp cooking,The book is OK not one I would rec-amend to any one.. I have read better ones on camp cooking in the last 100 years..
4,Hollywood Insider Secrets Galore!,"Real-world advice on getting that script marketed the right way & to the right people...and what to do once you actually are lucky enough to get in the door. The do's & don't's of writing what ""they"" want to see, and how to get ""in"". Pitching is hell, yes, but this book tells all & makes it seem, well, easy. Networking & why it's essential, getting to ""know"" the dreaded Hollywood mailroom reader, finding an agent who will help you sell your script, where to market specific genres of scripts...it's all here, in user-friendly format."
3,could have been better,"At the beginning the story is riveting, however during the second half of the book, there are many twists not too credible at all, ""the hero is like superman"" figthing thugs, which makes the end somewhat disappointing"
5,Fantastic from Start to Finish!,"I haven't read a book this good for ages. It took me back to the early Ludlum. Great characters and neat settings. Maybe a little too long, but so what, the payoff was great! Exciting!!"
3,Not very Gripping,"It was an acceptable read. However, the topics the book touched upon; international banking, nuclear sabatage, Middle east undercover, are all topics that could make for an outstanding intrique. This book did not fully develop where it could have gone."
1,Terrible,"I'm an avid reader who enjoys good thrillers. Therefore, based on its many strong reviews, I looked forward to reading this book. To my surprise, though, it totally sucked. The plot is terribly boring, the character development is non-existent, the subplots are worse than the main plot, and the ending is pathetic. Contrary to what anyone may claim, this book is nothing like The Day After Tomorrow. Simply put, Numbered Account is the worst book I have read in the past several years. My advice: Don't waste your precious time or money on this one."
2,Could Have Been Easily Cut Down To 300 Pages!,"This book had a good idea, but it reminds of the Chamber, where the author got all caught up in the good idea and forgot how to tell it. The tale goes back and forth and back and forth revealing little pieces of information that have already been told before, that you have already figured out, or that you no longer care about. But I still held out for 2.5 weeks to get to the end only to wish I would have given it up. The end sucks! Not because of what happens, but because if you take over 700 pages to tell a story, the least you could do is elaborate on who ends up where. Who ended up running the bank(s), was Sylvia out of a job, who was caught and went to jail? What about Armin, who wasn't even mentioned after he got the heave ho? Was he vindicated? Overall, it was too long to leave so many questions unanswered. The author clearly lost focus."
4,Excellent breakthrough album,"I bought the LP ""Glide"" back in 1981 and was blown away by the crystal glass soundscapes, angelic female accompaniments, and hypnotic flute passages which evoke a haunting ethereal melancholy. What elevates this awesome album above the commonplace New Age is the six thoroughly engaging and seemingly simple melodies that captivate you on your first listen. It is the best effort from Peter Davison of the four albums with which I'm familiar and I would rate the solo album five stars.I am not as fond of ""Star Gazer"" even though it does have two top notch tracks (Binary Companion and Milky Way Tears). Parallax is above average also, but it and the remaining songs have jazz elements, vague melodies and typical arrangements that never perk my interest. Ironically, despite the title, this album does not have much space music feel to it and I would grudgingly rate the solo album three stars. My rating of 4 means I like the album, still listen to it and recommend a purchase."
1,a most dissatisfying read,"if you can spell ""casino"" you are much too advanced to waste time reading this. the author is apparently targeting the most uninitiated of casino visitors; however, it is difficult to imagine, with the proliferation of legalized gaming in this country, that any reader could be this wanting. all information in this book is readily accessible in any legalized gambling establishment free of charge and this author must certainly be aware of this fact. spend the $10 on a buffet when you get to Vegas!"
4,Beein using for 3 months- appears to work.,"Use one pill a day, and have notices significant reduction in hair loss over a period of 3 months, did reorder it again. Also hairs appears to be stronger. Will definitely recommend for someone with thinning hair or excessive hair loss."
2,OK movie,"The service was great but the movie was not. The original transformers is better, but the seller was excellent."
4,Innovative ideas powerful in the hands of the wise,"Here's one of the most sought-after AD&D supplements ever created - this one gives you unparalleled new horizons for adventure, because it adds the most powerful element of magic ever devised - time travel! Unfortunately, this character class was considered to be so over-powered and disruptive that the supplement will never be reprinted. Which is a shame, because this amazing book will give you thousands of new adventures, and is the perfect way to expand a campaign. The 96-page book includes: chronomancer experience, kits, subclasses, the nature of time in AD&D, timestreams, paradoxes, changing history, proficiencies, the Protectors, chronomancer spells, rules for desigining worlds of science fantasy, and more. Spectacular stuff! If you have the ability to curb a powerful character with balancing flaws, making a more rounded and interesting individual, a full-fledged Chronomancer will open up infinite realms of adventure possibilities."
3,Starts off Good but the Finish is less than Ordinary,"I was under the impression based on the title of this book that the author had some real insight into the relationship between Ike and Monty, however if he did this was not presented in the book.The Book starts off well presenting the Backgrounds of both Ike and Monty however when the book reaches the WWII stage, it then just becomes a brief review of the campaigns in Europe and the roles played by both men.This book was a real disappointment to me."
1,Trash,"This book takes on the so called Harvard Consortian approach. This book gives vague examples, then turns around and asks question that seem to be written by a torture committee. My instructor even hated the book and only taught from it because it was what was used by the Math dept. The author seriouly needs to put more examples with some meat on them because as stated before the examples are vague or so easy that they do show what the concept is about. I had a back up Calculus book that helped quite a bit. Frustrating book!"
4,"Nice coverage, good tips and an easy read","""Practical Subversion"" is just that -- a no-fluff-just-stuff guide to using Subversion. It takes the reader from creating his first repository, importing his first project, checking out a working copy, and so on, to administering the repository and integrating with it using a number of programming languages -- briefly but still.Having said that, and even though it certainly covers a lot of ground, ""Practical Subversion"" is not a complete reference. The author covers all subjects in a pragmatic manner, covering the common needs well and giving enough hints to help the reader in finding answers for the edge cases.What I especially like about product-oriented books like this one is when the authors sneak in advice on best practices in using the product, the ""tips and tricks"" type of gems that make you go ""wow"" in a bathtub. In addition to learning how to take a backup, I now know how to add auto-completion for Subversion commands in Bash!"
5,Spunout01,"I purchased Rendezvous because I have other Doug Cameron CD's and know he is a phenomenal violinist. Rendezvous was no different. You listen to it a couple times and then you want to hear more. We met Doug on a cruise ship about 10 yrs ago where he often performs to packed houses. Now we check the entertainment before we book a cruise to see if he will be one of the performers.....he sells the cruise ! You won't be disappointed in any of his work. Also, purchased this through Amazon one touch shopping which is about as slick as it comes when buying anything on line."
1,Poor Service by you guys,"I haven't received the book till now, it's surprising that you have dealers who take the payment and don't send the material, in this regard E-Bay is much better than you guys..give me my money back!Kanwal"
1,Good But.................,"This product arrived on time and in reasonable shape. Sound quality is good. It does have a relatively modest output ceiling , so if your going to want to turn up the volume beyond loud, this will not work.My trouble with this unit is that the electronic door which slides up and down sounds like a cheap train set. The clicking and whirling sound that it makes is amazingly low-tech and cheap. The door occasionally gets stuck. Although all of these problems do not change the tuner or CD playback, they do turn a sleek, hi-tech stereo into a garage/ woodshed unit not suitable for your office or living room.My recommendation is to spend the money wisely on another product. I will be returning mine soon, when or if I can figure out how to do that with an opened electronic item from Amazon. The shipping costs back to NY are almost 1/2 the cost of the unit (35.00)"
2,CD player does not last but a couple of uses.,"I read the reviews before buying and yes they stated the CD portion of this did not work well in fact for me it almost imediatly it will not read a CD, and after only 10-15 uses. This is in a summer home not really used often at all, it barely made it through the Holidays. I will not buy another Phillips product and Amazon should issue people who bought this piece of junk a refund or similar replacement. After all the bad reviews they should a least stop selling it!"
3,$$$$$???,"I bought this phillips stereo system from amazon in january, 2009 and paid $78 for it. I mounted it in my kitchen for when I'm cooking and enjoyed it so much, I thought I'd get another one for when I'm hoop-dancing outside (aerobic-check out on youtube). I saw it at wallyworld for $74 and thought I'd check it out on Amazon. Imagine my shock when I saw it listed for such a high price ($260). It is a great little piece for $70's, but I'm tight on the purse-strings and have never had the itch to spend more than I had to. Shop around for a better price. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star."
1,"Oh, Boy, what a system...arrived not functioning....","Oh, my. It's a beauty to look at, and just what I needed: a slim system to play music and books on tape while I do housework. Great idea. Radio does work. The CD player kept spitting out ALL the cd's I inserted. from day one. It never worked. So, back she goes. Was this perhaps made in China?"
1,Defective Cd Playback,"You read these reviews about the cd not functioning after a few months of use; try FROM DAY ONE. There is a workaround with the aux inputs and another player, and I like the sound I'm hearing, but its not a keeper. I tried the radio, and I'm not tuning into my favourite am stations either. If Phillips would figure out and solve these bugs this would be a great little system, but alas it's not. I have much better luck with sony products; phillips/magnavox always have ghosts in their machines. Be warned!"
2,Philips MC235B review,"We bought it from Walmart, brought it home and set it up. Pretty easy to set up. It played CDs fine that day. Next day, different story. It stopped spinning after a few seconds, another time it didn't spin at all. When it did, the timing was slow.That was only the 2nd day! Back it goes!!"
1,Lasted about two years,I only used this to play CD's. The sound seemed reasonable to me. After about two years of light use it will no longer play CD's.
2,A Philips Customer,"I am a regular Philips customer. I have Philips 42 LCD (love it), two of their home theatres (both great), two DVD players, and three MP3 players. This item was my first Philips item to have a problem with. Months after I bought it, it began to skip tracks on CD's. I contacted Philips, they told me to send it back and they would replace it. In about a week I received another unit. It played fine. But, the one thing I did not like - it was a reburbished unit. And for that fact I gave it to a college student I know. He has not had any problems with it. The sound is good for the size it is. And the design is attractive. I would have probably kept it if I had gotten a new unit to replace my NEW unit that was only a couple months old."
3,Helpful book for a VERY hard test,"Having looked at several study books and aides for this test, I have to say that none of them helped with the test as well as they should have. This book is no exception. It contains much valuable information but also skips stuff that's important for the test. Be sure to go out of your way to find information on ODBC errors, the exam will nail you on those!I'm not even sure that you can take the IIS 4 exam anymore so be doubly careful. Make sure it's the IIS 4 exam you plan to take before buying this!"
3,I use it when the allergy & air pollution counts are high...,"Once I got past looking like Typhoid Mary walking down the street, I did notice a difference in my asthma. It's hard to wear for more than an hour outside in the heat, because your face sweats so much. I tried wearing it in the house on one of the toxic mold level days here in Chicago, but I couldn't use the phone with it on (sounded too muffled). So overall, it's good but not great for my purposes."
5,Excelent Item,"This switch have very good capabilites, vlan, trunk, LACP (Link aggregation or IEEE 802.1AX-2008), runs very cool and is rock solid."
5,Destined to be a bestseller,"This book, written by an amazing woman, has all the depth and more passion than Angela's Ashes. It moved me to tears, the determination of one little girl to overcome the harsh hand life dealt her and convey it to us, her readers. I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down. Barbara Robinette Moss captivated me and shared the story of a life so foreign to me in graphic and compassionate detail. I loved the book."
5,One of the Best Memoirs I Ever Read,"I loved this book. It really touched my heart and evoked so many emotions in me, and brought me to tears more than once. Mostly, I wanted to reach right through the pages and hug Barbara and all her siblings. And her mother too. What strength and character each of them has shown. I am in awe and admiration of all of them. I loved how they really looked out for each other and protected one another: from the father, in school, in their neighborhood.It is so sad that any children had to live like this, but I know many do. Blessings to Barbara and her siblings and I hope they have all healed from the trauma of their childhood and are enjoying much deserved happiness.Oh, and it was wonderful to see Alice's review!!!!!"
2,Avoid this gun,"As soon as I took it out of the box, the gun looked amazing. However, I was extremely disappointed to find out that the barrel was actually plastic, not metal as advertised. After two shots, the gun broke. When this happens, pressure from the gas inside the gun shot backwards and broke the loading chamber, and almost took out an eye as well. I'd avoid this shotgun at all costs, it breaks incredibly easy. It's only redeeming factor is that it looks pretty."
5,Great Legion Collection,"Some of the best Shooter stories during this period, with some excellent artwork by Mike Grell. I wish they would have included the very last issue of Grell's run (#224), Shooter's second Stargrave story and setup for a great character plot for Brainiac 5, that ended on a sour note when another writer took over in the middle of the multi-part storyline, for shame. However, this archive ends with #223, Jim Shooter's intro of Pulsar Stargrave. Both the Cary Bates and Jim Shooter stories are better than generally given credit for, particularly for this transitional time in all comic book stories, between self contained character oriented plots and latter day multi-part epics. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of Karate Kid #1 by Paul Levitz who would go on to become one the best Legion writers later. The extra cover galleries including the Tabloid size Grell cover for the Mordru reprint were nice to have. All in all an excellent volume of this archive series to have."
2,"Too statistical, no mathematics ...","The book is well organized and mainly has a statistical approach, which is not enough when talking about getting ""the edge"" of roulette. Although the author is sincere explaining that all systems will fail in long run due to the house edge, he misses an important aspect of roulette: the mathematical side. The topology of the bets, the probabilities of the complex betting systems, all this mathematics stuff is missing or is touched vaguely. I found Barboianu's book far superior on all counts."
3,The Real Age Diet,"While the information in this good is good, it seems to focus more on reviewing other diets and tell you what is wrong with them and less on tell you how to do it right.More focus on the whys of nutrition would have been helpful.I have enjoyed and use this book, but you have to search for the information you need."
5,LIFE IS WODERFUL....,THIS BOOK IS SO HELPFUL FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A WEIGHT PROBLEM OR NEEDS A HEALTHY WAY OF EATING
5,How to get the teaching job you want,"Excellent resource for anyone looking for a teaching job. It has great cover letter examples, resume examples and lists of interview questions. There is a lot of information packed into this book. Some of it is common sense, but good for a reminder. I give it 5 stars!"
3,"Decent taste, healthy, but very basic.","Good for what it is, but not very delicious. Utilitarian. Fills a hunger void. Tastes pleasant, but not great. I don't understand the bad reviews hammering it for not being more flavorful like cheese curls... what were people expecting from baked corn meal flavored with salt and yeast? Good snack anyway with reasonably good texture that is great for those intolerant of cheese, spice, or stronger flavors. To me these would be much improved with better flavors... perhaps add a few varieties that taste better and call this one ""Corn Tings - Unflavored"" or ""Corn Tings - Original""? I'd buy other flavors with this texture and quality, but this one is just a bit too bland for me.Overall, does the job it was designed to do: healthy, light, and easy on the body."
5,bungee into antiproduct,"it will be quite an eclective dive, i assure you. this album is an unbelievable mixture of sushi, cinnamon, and who-knows-what-all. i say this because it made me think. upon listening i felt random stimulations all throughtout my brain...it was working overtime with inspiration. it really made me want to create some music of my own.psychedelic girlfriend and bungee jumping people die are fine specimens. the former is a bit rock-y yet subdued to the point of easy listening. the latter scared me. granted it was almost midnight when i heard it first, but it employs a very haunting intro that repreats conveniently throughout the whole of the song. under other exciting vocals, of course.the experience of listening to antiproduct was very uplifting. it's a sort of spacey cosmic swirl feeling. care to try it yourself? you ought to at least consider it.absolutely spectacular, for lack of a better word!"
5,the best tracks on the higher octave label,Almost anything on the higher octave label is worth listening to! I have a number of the albums from where this compilation was derived but to have all the great tracks on one album is something special. If you enjoy modern instrumental then this is the album for you.
4,"Funny, Cute AND Creepy!","A small, beautifully illustrated book about different ways children have died. Lovely. Particularly like 'W is for Winnie embedded in ice'. Just creepy and horrible when you really think about it."
1,Sick & Twisted,"I wish I could give this Zero stars. It is a very dark book and I can't imagine why anyone would write, publish, gift it, or read it. There is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk? Garbage in garbage out!"
5,No sweetener needed : ),Very tasty and rich in flavor. I make 16 oz of tea at a time and with this tea you only need one bag versus the two of less tasty brands. If your trying to get away from sweeteners in general this needs none because it's Naturally sweet. Divide the price in two because one bag has enough to flavor 16 ozs.
4,Drive Bose (shelf) speakers fine but no use with old USB ports,"I tried to drive my Bose (shelf) speakers from my either brandnew desktop or old laptop. First, I tried to turn my old Vaio laptop into a music server. All pretty lights went on as soon as I plugged in the creature but all sound went to the laptop's built-in speakers, not to the shelf speakers. It later revealed (or maybe it's in the documentation?) that Xmod does not work with old (slow) USB ports. Then, I tried my desktop, which has only a basic sound board. It removed vast majority of white noise. I can hear them only when no music is played."
3,Got a bit more cash and a mac?,"Get the Apogee Duet. It is the real piece of equipment that this toy is copying. Duet has none of the (plastic) bells and (shrill) whistles and is a true audiophile headphone/recording/monitoring solution.If you listen to mp3s though, this might be the ticket. I don't like the ""modes"", but often the USB audio out sounds much better than the built in computer headphone jack!It's all a matter of budget. You get what you pay for...and this is midfield."
4,Great stopgap solution,"The earphone jack to my Dell laptop broke, and replacing it would mean a new motherboard since it's all attached. As this is the way I normally feed audio out from the laptop, I needed an inexpensive solution, and this was a great find. Great quality sound, ultra-simple design, affordable price. Good stuff!"
2,BAVA'S LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT,"There's a scene where the criminals force a kidnapped woman to urinate in front of them---even the commentary on the dvd mentions it being done first in LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT.This an ok eurotrash movie, slow moving, mostly set in a car on a highway, with a BAY OF BLOOD maybe-surprize ending. KIDNAPPED is one of many 1970s italian movies that ripped off DIRTY HARRY/DEATH WISH. It certainly doesn't have the style of bava's horror movies.Too bad the origonal producer, who had more money, lost out on the project. And too bad Al Letteri, from THE GODFATHER, was kicked off the movie for being a drunk---he died months later, at age 47, from his boozing."
5,This is not a toy,"This model kit is Japanese version, not American version.All manuals are written by Japanese, however you can build completely.Original price of this kit is 1500 Yen.This is not a toy, this kit is fragile.You must be careful when you fabricate the parts."
5,"Good Read, Exciting ending",Lieutenant Bak is turning into as interesting a detective as could be found in the 20th/21st Century. It is especially interesting to watch characters solve crimes when they don't have all the complicated forensics of today. This is good-oldfashion detective reading at its best.
4,cliffnotes for a major exam,"at the time I took this test I had a few other certs which made my life easier to pick up the material. I had a security+, project+ and ceh at this point. for a 6 hour exam, there is no way this is going to be enough to successfully pass. that being said, I use this as the first book I read to prepare. I already passed the security+ a few years earlier and had many years working on things when I took the exam. this is an excellent place to start gather information. the next book I read was shon harris' all in 1. this book was well worth the price and the time to read it. I finished the exam in 4 1/2 hrs including 2 naps, a walk and triple checking my answers. I received the confirmation of passing about 2 weeks after taking the test."
5,A real Gem,"A real Gem: with grace, serenity, love & hope. Perfectly performed and produced. I reccomend this CD for anyone and their whole family."
4,Great Cleaver,"What I like about this cleaver is that it has weight and is well balanced. The smooth composite handle feels good in the hand. The weight is nice because it helps do what a cleaver is designed for, to chop. The stainless steel finish is easy to clean. It's a great well constructed cleaver."
4,Titanic 1912,For the period of time and the length since the disaster occurred the book was very well written and conveyed to the reader.
2,"Low cost, really worth?","Since I got it, the hygrometer stays at 80% +/- 2% no matter what I do (use a steam humidifier or so). So I suspect it's not exactly working."
1,thermometer,"Bought it to learn the difference between farenheight and cellcius temperatures, hung it up outside and the firsyt wind blew it down and it fell apart. Save your money."
3,As a thermometer its ok,"The product seems to provide accurate temperature readings, but is a little difficult to read. There is space between the thermometer and the hygrometer so it would have been nice if there was more space between the degree marks.I do not think the hydrometer is working at all! I have this product for over 2 weeks now and there has been rainy and dry days. However, the gauge remains almost constant around 72%."
1,"nuclear link to cancers, strontium-90 in baby teeth, at radiation.org","When assessing nuclear power, the public should know about the baby tooth study which documents the nuclear emission strontium-90 in baby teeth, at birth, passing from mother to infant during pregnancy. This is linked to cancers. Look at radiation.org Have you noticed the ever increasing cancer rate seen in our younger generations? The NRC states that 50% of the US population live within 50 miles of a nuclear plant. The government's breast cancer mortality map lines up with the governments's nuclear map, all across the country!I discovered some of this data, after having non-genetic breast cancer, 11 months after my mother died of breast cancer. She lived on Long Island, downwind of 3 nuclear plants. Be careful if you live near a nuclear plant.I hope this author is aware of this data."
3,Attractive Towel but a Little Cheaply Made,"This towel is obviously a little cheaply made but it sure is attractive. It has nice vibrant colors and is very attractive. But it's not much for absorbing water, nor is it particularly comfortable on the skin. Nevertheless, for the price, it's a nice beach towel."
3,Thin for the price,"A cheap thin towel, but seems to be made ok. Wouldn't buy this for anyone but a serious fan who would sacrifice quality for team loyalty."
4,A great book by a great teacher,Prof. Milne and Prof. McDonald do a great job in displaying the ins and outs of Marketing in the Arena of professional Sports... This book explains how basic and advanced marketing principals and practices are applied and are to be applied to the succesful marketing or a professional sports franchise. If you are a business studet or recent graduate and want a fun and rewarding career read this book and get all the info you need.
4,Great book!,"I have read numerous books and manuals on how to mount a deer. Most were out-of-date for the times. I found this book to be very helpful and an easy step by step method of explaining. One is able to follow along and understand exactly what is going on, without getting lost. The pictures also help, along with clear descriptions of what products are used and how to use them. It leaves little unanswered. There is also a detailed overview of what was talked about in previous chapters and what products were used for what purpose. I enjoyed her layed back approach that gives one confidence. Definitely an up to date book. I highly recommend this book over an others. Hands down, no question about it!!"
1,"Learning Patience, Forbearance, and Forgiveness","As it turns out, QuickVerse Mac Bible Study 2007 Black Box doesn't work at all with Leopard, or with Safari 3 for that matter. QuickVerse customer service offers only long waits punctuated by announcements that anything you ask for may incur a nominal charge. What you don't get is any indication of when, if ever, the problem will be solved. So it's hard to rate QuickVerse as a Bible Study program.A one star rating is presented because the review program requires it. If that were not the case, there would be no star at all."
4,Good so far,"The wraps themselves I have been using for about a month. They are holding up fine. Although I would imagine that they will eventually need to be replaced, but at $4 a pair it won't be a big deal.One pair that I bought came mismatched in length, but they are being returned, so no complaints there."
4,Great First Production!,"Truly Everlasting, the movie, was excellent! Brenda Jackson and crew did a tremendous job in making the novel come alive in movie format. It has made me want to see more of her novels in this format. I know finances play a major role in this type of production. I highly recommend the video to All Brenda Jackson fans and those who love this genre!"
2,Not so good,"First let me qualify my review. I'm a published author (computer books) and I have personal experience selling goods and services online.I found this book is light on facts and filled with forward-looking statements. I don't blame the author for being enthousiastic but I found the book is mostly preaching. There's too little practical ""how-to"" information.Some of Mr Poynter other books (including the ""Self-Publishing Manual"") are of very high quality, full of practical, useful information. This one is not of the same quality."
5,Motown's Greatest Treasure,"Growing up in the 60's and 70's, I was not a great fan of the Motown sound, that is until the spinners came along. They opened up the whole genre for me and millions of others. This album is, I believe, their absolute best. Their harmony, orchestral arrangements, great lyrics and that beat! It's all in there. If you ever wondered what 70's music sounded like before the disco juggernaut ran everyone over, this is the album to get."
5,"By far, the best Spinners album.......Hands down!","I can't believe that the world as a whole has 'slipped up' on recognizing one of the most beautiful ballads ever recorded by the Spinners...""I Could Never(Repay Your Love)...Phillipe 'Soul' Wynne's voice over almost 7 minutes of lush musical wizardry that has YET to be recognized by Spinners fans and compilation producers. As well as the lost 'golden' song, more familiar tracks are ""How Could I Let You Get Away"", ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love"", ""One Of A Kind (Love Affair)"", and a personal favorite, ""Just Can't Get You Out Of My Mind"". ""Ghetto Child"" and ""I'll Be Around"" also appear on this first effort. I own the ""One Of A Kind"" double-CD anthology, but to me it was incomplete without ""I Could Never (Repay Your Love)"" and ""Just Can't Get You Out Of My Mind"", so I added them on at the end of disc 2. If you've loved the Spinners for years, but never heard 'Repay', you'll feel like you found a lost treasure. Trust me....it's worth the spin......"
4,Useful guide,"I have several years of experience in participating and leading strategic planning, and I have found this to be a very good reference guide. One that I still refer to with some frequency. It has high-level comprehensive concepts as well as detailed, practical steps. Not for everyone, especially if you are put off by ""business speak"", but if you live in that world and are comfortable with it, this can be a very good reference guide."
3,Excessive history and unrelated clutter.,"I had heard of the raid when I attended radar school in Virginia in 1943. The details of the raid described in the book are interesting. The book is padded with history unrelated to the raid and about photography also unrelated. However, if the ""padding"" hadn't been included the book would have only been a phamplet. I wish the author had described in technical detail the unit captured."
4,"Good Selections, For the Most Part","Lacks a lot of the filler that plagued the earlier volumes, and does include some actual hits (""Bette Davis Eyes,"" ""Just the Two of Us,"" ""Living Inside Myself,"" and ""Sweetheart""), but more could have been done to tighten up this CD. All original versions."
5,The essential guide for Perl programmers,"This book has withstood the test of time and is the go-to reference for working Perl programmers. In short, the writing is better than the free information you will find on the web, and it is conveniently packaged into a useful, searchable CD-ROM. The dead tree book the CD-ROM comes with is also worthwhile, but I would gladly do without it in lieu of having it on the CD."
5,So Far So Good,Have had this product for a couple of months now and have only had to use it once. Instructions were straight forward and it was very easy to use. I've been very happy with the procuct so far...
2,"HP K5400 Printer, Beware of Printer Head Cartridge","I just recently purchased this printer and I am skeptical about the so called ""lowest ink cost"". Yes, The actual ink cartridges are reasonable priced, but they don't really mention the two additional ""printer head"" cartridges that must be replaced along with the ink cartridges. The ""printer head"" cartridge cost around $69 dollars a pop. They don't mention the page yield for these ""printer head"" cartridges. I traded my Brother HL-2040 for the HP K400 which I now think was a mistake. If you can do without ""color"" then I would say the Brother HL-2040 Monochrome Laser Printer (retails for around $89) is your best bet in terms of long run affordability and print quality. You can get a Brother HL-2040 toner cartridge for around $30.00 (page yield: 2,400)."
1,I'm returning it tomorrow.,"I had no way of knowing (the manual has to be downloaded from HP's website) that if one ink tank is exhausted, the entire printer is useless. That's right - if all you want to do is print black text, and you've got a full tank of black ink, the thing sits and cries for its yellow instead of printing the black text. Never saw that trick before, and don't want to see it again."
4,Pretty solid printer.,Pretty solid printer. I usually print documents in the economy mode and the quality is reasonable and fast. It is a bit loud and took quite awhile to set up. I have been using it for about a month with no problems.
1,It leaks!,My office has had two of these that leaked ink internally when new.I would stay FAR away from this printer.
4,Printer Review,Was a bit shocked that the new product order didn't come in the original packaging. The printer parts were loosely packed. Install went fine. I believe the product was new and unused.
3,Printhead problem solved,"I was very happy with this printer until I started having printhead problems. I ordered and installed a new printhead and got the yellow flashing light that would not go away. I was ready to get a new printer when I decided as a last resort to try cleaning the holes that the printhead fits into with Windex on a q-tip. Now the original printhead works and the printhead health is rated ""good"" with a green circle, when before the cleaning it had a yellow circle."
1,HP K5400 printheads don't last--negating it's value,"Length:: 2:20 MinsWhy you shouldn't buy the HP officejet pro 5400 Color printer. Kevin Kelly and Cool Tools were wrong. Sigh. God I hate inkjet printers. You get what you pay for in this world, and inkjet printers are a scam. They're little crappy disposable ink stores. Gah.HP K5400 Officejet Pro Color Printer"
5,Perez Prado Was One Of The Top Ten Mambo Latin Bands,"If you are looking for some of the best latin mambo band you have found it, I belive Perez Prado music will live for ever, You can play his music on any type of party you man have, His music will make you get up and dance, you won't be able to set down, do youself a favor, Don't pass this wonderful CD up, oder Perez Prado CD's now, you will be glad you did."
4,Not a Match for More Than A Mistress,"While I enjoyed The Secret Pearl, I have to note that the storyline is somewhat similar to Mary Balogh's More Than A Mistress. And since this was written before More Than A Mistress, which is my favorite Balogh book, I would have to say that the author certainly improved on the premise.Both stories had gentlewomen fleeing from their sheltered lives because of the mistaken belief that they had committed a crime. They eventually took refuge in the homes of dukes until the true perpetrators of the crimes found them. Both the dukes confronted the villains to clear the names of the innocent heroines.The prose and writing syle was also similar but I just loved More Than A Mistress because the heroine was spunkier right from the beginning and the humbling of the oh-so-stuffy duke was a delight to read.So while both books are wonderful reading materials, if you have to choose between The Secret Pearl and More Than A Mistress, I would recommend the latter."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"To whomever it may concern,We were forced to read this book in English class. I'm 14. And there is no one in the class that enjoyed it, and most of my friends had to ask me to tell them the plot because they could not bear reading it. Which was also a problem. The plot. Besides being pathetically written, it doesn't so much have a plot as a list of events which are poorly tied at up at the end. If you are a teacher looking for books to give to your class, please avoid this one. Try ""Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" or ""Animal Farm"". But have mercy, don't subject your students to this. If you are a parent, don't give them the book, confirming that books are bad is not a good message to send. I warn you, don't read it, ever.Sincerely, Michael"
1,Another Defective DVD,This would be a wonderful item- if only it played. I also recieved two of these DVD's and neither would play- format issues. I really want a working copy of this video if anyone has one!
2,Dogs did not like these.,I bought these for my dogs to prevent grass burns. My dogs did not like the taste of the biscuits.
1,A Handbook on the Book of Daniel (UBS Handbook),"I filed this book in the Forge. It made for a slow burn, just right to coake up the coal.Item being reviewedA Handbook on the Book of Daniel (UBS Handbook)"
1,Stay away from this trimmer...,"This trimmer has absolutely no value at all. I purchased one online, it was broken, so I purchased another one which worked. When I say worked I mean the power turned on, and nothing more beyond that. The trimmer does NOT cut hair. Seriously, it cut maybe 5 or 6 hairs by the time I gave up in a minute or two. I am not sure what the design flaw is, perhaps the blades don't spin fast enough or poor construction. Definately stay away from this one."
1,Remington NE300 Review,I found that the Remington trimmer did not trim as closely as Panasonic's similar model. I returned it and bought another Panasonic instead.
3,disappointing for a MG.. good price though.,"I have several Gundam kits and this is probably one of the worst MG i have. The model tried and failed at a sophisticated look because - 1) the blue skin looks like it'll peel off any second and 2) the weapons were poorly designed and lacked parts and colors. The arms are also very loose and falls off everytime you try to make a pose. The legs are also stiff and not very poseable. I would seriously recommend painting the model to cover the poorly made skin. Overall, the only think I liked about this kit is the whip, which I have equipted to my MG freedom. For the price of $20, this is a good buy considering my friend bought the same thing at an anime convention this year for $45."
3,basic to intermediate,"decent book for beginners and casual players, but not for the advanced playeer. Wish to author would play me for .25 cents a point... I'd retire to the Bahamas, rather than Florida"
3,Great Season. Bad Disks.,Enjoyed this season a lot. It would have been a lot better if the disks had not been defective. Hope next season is better.
2,Writing is almost as bad as the show itself,"I used to be an avid Passions watcher, so when this book first came out I couldn't wait to read it. I've had it now for over a year and still not finished it. I find it really hard to get through it without laughing. I know that its SUPPOSED to be tongue-in-cheek, but its almost ridiculous. There isn't anything in the book that you don't already know if you watch the show. You get more ""flowery"" details, but actual facts are the same. I suppose if you want a good, mindless read then this is for you. If you absolutely HAVE to get it, then buy the paperback. You'll save yourself some money and they have added bonus chapters that aren't in the hardcover."
5,If you watch the show.....,"then you definitly need to read this book!!!! Even if you haven't seen a single episode, the book is still excellent to read!!!! It tells all the deep dark secrets of the older characters when they were young. It's romantic, sexy, trecherous, sad, and wonderfuly happy all at the same time. The characters emotions are well portrayed, and expressed. The characters themsevles range in their personalities from the evil Julian, to the saint like Sam.Each scene is vivdily described, and teh plot twists and turns many times. You may even want to watch the show after you read the book. :)"
1,Dude,"If you're not a fan of psychology, don't get this! I didn't find this helpful at all. I guess if you love the subject, you'd find it helpful."
4,A moving reading experience,"As I read this book, I initially found it to be pleasant enough but somehow lightweight and insubstantial. However, it definitely gathered emotional momentum and gravitas as it went along, and by the end, I was really moved by it. It is a love story in the broadest sense, exploring the multitude of ways in which human goodness can enrich interpersonal relationships and provide perhaps the only real hope for happiness. Even those characters who are incapable of basic decency are treated with a measure of compassion by this very generous author. Well worth reading."
5,I can't wait for the movie,"I hear they're going to make a movie from this novel -- and I can see why. It's so visual (the lead character is a painter), so romantic (the handyman is everyone's dream guy) and it's funny. I can't wait to see who they pick to play the handyman. My choice would be Ben Affleck, or even Ben Stiller. But don't wait for the movie! read this one now -- it's such a satisfying read."
1,HORRIBLE - THIS HAS TO BE A HOAX,"After suffering through this pathetic ragbag novel, I, a lover of good literature both modern and traditional, have come to the unmistakeable conclusion that the critical raves for ""The Handyman"" must be one of the century's greatest hoaxes. I just wonder who is trying to fool the public. I implore anyone reading this to beware! Carolyn See's novel is the most inept, pathetic excuse for literature imaginable. This book was so poorly written, so depressing in its shallow conception, that it is offensive to the intelligence of the average reader. I was amazed that See cannot write a complex sentence, let alone a sentence of more than five or six words. High School stuff this is. Unbelieveable!"
3,I Feel Used,"It's a shame the characters Carolyn See so marvelously created couldn't have written the ending of the book for her. I like to think they would have been more true to themselves. I really did enjoy this book -- until the ending. Then, it seemed to switch genres. Personal Odyssey (our limitations, are they based in reality or poor guidance?) vs. romantic fantasy (anything goes -- the sky's the limit). A warning: If honesty in literature is what makes the reading experience uplifting for you, this book may bring you down."
1,A lousy book.,"A trashy, amateurishly written book that views its main character as a cross between Alan Alda and Jean-Claude Van Damme, and its women as either hopeless incompetents or sex-obsessed Madonnas. The only good thing about it is it's fast reading so you'll finish it quickly enough."
4,A Perfect Day At The Beach,"What could be better than lounging on the beach on a hot summer day, completely absorbed in a trashy novel like The Handyman? This is the one to stuff in your beach bag. Carolyn See is the queen of the tossaway tale, light and breezy, perfect for passing the time until the sun goes down and the fun starts up. Who cares if the characters are caricatures? Or if the plot never thickens, but merely curdles? Bob Hampton, the implausible cardboard cut-out protagonist of The Handyman, would surely enjoy filling his empty hours reading this book, as any self-infatuated person would. On the whole, this is as good as any Harlequin novel, but much more erudite and artsy. (Well, Bob is an Artist-In-Training, right?) Have at it, and enjoy!"
2,Band too big.,"I chose this rating because of the band - not the watch. I received this watch a couple of weeks ago and haven't been able to wear it due to the band being sooooo big. I haven't had a chance to go to a jeweler and pay a fee to have some links taken out. Hopefully, they can remove enough that it fits. I'm a little disappointed that I couldn't take it out of the box and wear it right away. Maybe Bulova could start offering different size bands on their watches so you wouldn't have to pay to have links removed."
1,Estrogen to Satisfy Midlife Sexuality,"The author of this book is a gynecologist that must own stock in Premarin! Through out the book he advocates the use of prescription hormones, especially estrogen, to deal with all the problems of midlife sexuality. He has a quick couple of pages on herbs and supplements, but does not really recommend them. He also ""goes off"" on the terms natural estrogen verses synthetic estrogen. His reasoning is that Premarin which is made from pregnant horses urine is a natural substance, afterall it is natural to horses. Well, the last time I checked I wasn't a pregnant horse! If you are looking for answers to the sexual problems that plague us all as we age and do not want to take prescription hormones, do not waste your money on this book. His answer to everthing is to take estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. In the authors own words, you must ""use it or loose it"" and taking estrogen and testosterone will enable you to still use it."
1,Secrets of a hormone pusher!,"I'll admit to barely skimming this book after discovering it was just another tout for estrogen, testosterone, and Viagra. There was not point in adding wasted time to my already wasted money."
1,Awful Product,Scratched the #$#! out of my glasses. Two awful scratches across my lenses. Couldn't be more disappointed with a product.
2,Expensive,"Small and expensive: I had to buy this to meet Amazon's $25 free shipping. I was in a hurry and it's my fault that I didn't look closely at its description on the site; I just want to get the transaction over with. It does the job it says it will do but if you are only going to use this to clean your eyeglass lenses or your cellphone, you are better off with the ones sold at grocery checkout counters. For your very expensive DSLR, maybe. There are lens cloths that Walmart or Target sell in their optical stores that are much cheaper."
5,Hey a Book about Christmas and Hanukkah!,This is the first children's book I know that has a child celebrating both Hanukkah and Christmas. It is nice because it depicts it as normal for that family and doesn't drag by explaining the religious differences of the parents. Very respectful of many children's lives.
2,Great idea but boring.....,"I ordered this book for a 3 years old child in the interfaith family thinking that it will explain the two holidays - Christmas and Hannukah - to a child in an interesting form. It does tells about the 2 holidays but it is so boring that it's hard to get a child, whom normally you can read several books at a time, to get through the end of it. I thought it was a great thing to buy a book on this subject but unfortunately it's quite uninteresting even for a child."
2,Alyssa Milano is Hot!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was not great it was ok, but it wasnt brilliant. Dont let the cover fool you Alyssa Milano does not star in this movie. Id say her total screen time would amount to around five minutes if you are a huge fan of hers like I am then buy it but if not i wouldnt recommend it."
3,Overall beautiful but disturbing,"Granted,this book has beautiful photos of some important contemporary pieces by some master makers. Very disturbing is the fact that some of the makers included here are individuals who have plaigerized the work of others-fortunately there are only a few who are undeservedly included. It's unfortunate but other than this and the editorial mistakes, it is still a beautiful book that is worth having. I guess I'd rather give it 3.5 stars!"
3,Not for the visually challenged.,"A lot of the crossword puzzles are tiny!! Hard to read clues and even harder to write in those grids. Some of the word games are kind of unique, never seen before."
4,Detailed Yorkie Information,"I enjoyed the yorkie-specific information in this book and the anecdotes throughout book make it better than the average yorkie care guide. I have two issues with the book however. The first is the font. The font is a typewriter type, making the book feel sophomoric. The other issue is the tone of the book. If read by someone with no knowledge of yorkies they would extrapolate from all her warnings that yorkies are timid and fragile and need coddling...but that is far from the truth. For example, she recommends extreme caution in interactions between yorkies and other dogs in such a way that might make owner afraid to let their yorkie play with other dogs, instead of letting them explore and be dogs."
3,Mixed kids....,"Americans are soooo stuck on this shallow black/white thing. Do blasians have this hang up? Italian/Jews? Being the father of two bi-racial boys, both my sons KNOW that their mother and their father love them dearly...isn't THAT a much bigger issue AND challenge? that has a much more serious impact on a young person's self-esteem and value....A dedicated Dad."
4,Interesting Account of Biracial Americans,"I really enjoyed this book. It is an intriguing look at the lives of people who have one African heritage and one European heritage parent, and how they fit into the traditional American concepts of ""black"" and ""white."" The book features interviews with people both young and old and examines their attitudes towards race, community, interracial relationships, culture, and more. An excellent read for anyone interested in this subject"
5,"Only 35,000 copies in print",This quite possibly may be the best baseball book out there. I've had my copy since day 1. Still great reading when your searching for info on the old timers or just want to increase your baseball knowledge . Just recently found out the current value. Will never sell it.
1,"Read page 4, 7th edition of the text","The first reading page of this text has four grammatical errors. This in itself speaks of how poorly the text must have been edited. What a rip off for the price of this book. I could read it three times and I would still not have sufficient knowledge of networks or data communications to pass an MCSE test. For the $92.50 that I spent I could have bought. a.)Tcp/Ip Exam Prep Guide. b.) Tcp/Ip Exam cram guide. c.)I still would have had $10 or $15 left over to go towards Flash cards or something else. Then at the end of the day I would be able to sit and pass a certification test. Stay far from this. If your college or Univerity is using this text, then they are idiots."
5,"This a very nice cover, I am very pleased","This a very nice cover, I am very pleased. The leather is soft and the cover looks more expensive than it actually was."
5,very pleased,I was very satisfied with the leather checkbook cover I purchased. It was a great value and shipping came in a timely manner. Thank You once again. Michelle W
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"Perhaps I expected too much, but while this book is amazingly comprehensive, it is also amazingly amateurish. Almost every entry is filled with opinions - how does one separate facts (an encyclopedia is supposed to have facts in it, right?) from Gray's perspectives? It feels like reading something from a freshman writing seminar."
5,Everything you need to know and then some...,"This book has it all. It is just what it says it is -- an encyclopedia. It is a must for Dylanologists. If you have been a fan of Bob Dylan like I have since 1962, it is an absolute must! I am continuely amazed at how much I find new everytime I pick it. This book is definitely a pick up and open and read and then let it take you to where it will with its links, references and connections to ideas, songs, symbolism, and the famous (and not so famous). It is in NO small words a BIG book about a man who has cut a large swarth through Americana."
5,Little kids just love Elmo!,"Very easy to stick to table. My son gets very excited when we use it because of the characters, and I'm very happy he is not eating off tables that have been cleaned with who knows what."
2,Didn't care for it,My 8 month old figured out how to rip it off the table in 2 seconds flat (no matter how much time I spent trying to secure it before she got to it). She loves the pictures and loves to rip it off the table but it doesn't do much for protecting her from germs.
5,The best compilation of Walter Wanderley's music,Walter Wanderley is one of the greatest Brazilian Hammond Organists and was a pioneer of Bossa Nova that he preferred to call Jazz Samba. This compilation includes his latest versions recorded in the USA with a wonderful set of musicians and a great Hammond B3 sound
3,A GREAT START TO FIND OUT ABOUT SOLAR ENERGY,"WHEN, I FIRST GOT ""THE FUEL SAVER"" IN THE MAIL I WAS A LITTLE BIT UPSET ABOUT THE SIZE. BUT, AFTER READING THE BOOK I FOUND THAT IT HELPED ME A LOT, WITH JUST 81 PAGES THAT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I NEEDED TO GET STARTED ON MY OWN SOLAR SYSTEM. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK ABOUT PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU. BUT IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE YOUR ELECTRIC BUILD BY USING SIMPLE METHODS, THIS IS THE BOOK. IT'S EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND. THE APPENDIX IS OUTSTANDING FOR FUTURE REFERENCES."
4,good tips,"Some things you may not have heard before that will save you money. Clear, concise, thankfully brief. Nothing long winded, just the facts. Should be on every shelf."
5,My favorite,"I Love it! In my opinion, some of the very best from Lara and Reyes. This CD is my personal favorite of theirs. I am glad I came across it and could purchase it. I have it on my iPod now. I played it over our outdoor stereo system so we could all listen to it while hanging by the pool this summer. It definatel took us to Exotic places (at least for a while)."
4,very enjoyable,its great fun to be learning and watching interesting personal relationships playing at the same time.add a little drama and have excellent entertainment
3,Bones plot development,"Watching the season, I was able to catch up parts of episodes missed. The ending was neat where they promise to meet one year later at the Washington Mall. Exactly how season 5 began."
5,Great TV Show,This show is great. This season was full of new twists and turns and a lot of laughs. I would recommend watching this series to anyone who likes crime drama shows.
3,Nice but there are issues .. .read on,"I purchased Ulead VideoStudio 10 Plus as I had good experiences with the previous version. It creates mpeg-4 video for iPods and otehr portable media quite easily. I came across one important issue ... I imported a home movie from a DVD the ntried to do another one immediately after, but could not. The ""IMPORT"" button in the dialog was no longer available. After several attempts I rebooted and was able to import the next movie. On caontacting Ulead's tech support I was told that I had to reboot after each movie import as ""the memory was not being freed up for use."" I asked if they were working on a solution and was told they had no solution. Besides this BIG issue its a nice product for creating your videos from pictures, existing video etc. This issue earned it 3 stars instead of 5."
2,NOT ready for Prime Time,"We purchased this program because of it's glitzy features. But be forewarned: this editing software is SLOW...SLOW...SLOW at rendering.And there are BUGS in the program. It locks up at various stages, and has turned out to be a NIGHTMARE at the chaptering/disc burning stage.Ulead's former program, Workshop 2, is much more stable, but it doesn't burn WIDESCREEN menus. Why can't this company get things right?VideoStudio 10 Plus has some nice features, but you'll pay a PRICE (FRUSTRATION) if you try to use the software. You've been warned. We do NOT recommend it. Check around in forums for software others highly recommend."
1,Ulead Studio 10 Sucks,"I have had this bug laden, non performing piece of crap for 5 months. It has yet to produce anything. If you are thinking about purchasing this software find anything else. Even the windows supplied movie maker is better than this crap.To add insult to non performing software tech support is absolutely non-exsistant. I mean the FAQ is only one page long, you can not even look up a knowledge base answer. Mainly cause how can you build a knowledge base when no one can get it to work!Runs for a few seconds than locks up, brand new computer running all the newest stuff and it still won't do a simple clip cut!Run away save yourself from this terrible software."
1,"Made my dog very, very sick...","Gave this bone to my dog...the next day, he wouldn't eat or drink anything, was lethargic, vomiting. This continued for 3 days til we took him to the vet. $93 & an IV later, the vet says, yep, it was the Jumbone. It completely messed up his digestive system. No more dog treats for our dog!"
5,overall good product,"The first review was more than critical, it was hysterical, biased by what the writer perceives as science as he has learned it. This amazon comment section is not the forum to discuss all his comments -- the length of my rebuttal (and queries) would consume more space than is appropriate to this site. Jumbone is a fine product and is generally of high quality. It is a treat, not a food substitute, and it does stimulate some dogs to chew who might not otherwise. It's nonsense to list all those items categorically as ""bad."" I'm not employed by any company connected with Jumbone, and I don't have any interest in the product other than it keeps my dog healthy and happy. Give us break, will ya?"
1,The Beverly Hills Diet is everything wrong with fad diets.,"I would normally prefer not to comment negatively on a book (I come from a family of writers), but I bought this book because it seemed to use the ideas of food combining which have been around for many decades. She has cribbed ideas from other people, given little or no credit (unlike Marilu Henner who is peddling similar concepts but far less goofy) and written it in a breathless style which would make Jacqueline Susann spin in her grave. The pseudo-science is an embarrassment. I threw the book out after one-half hour. One amusing aspect is the foods she has on the diet--available only to the privileged few and Alice Waters. I guess you might lose weight if you followed the ridiculous regimen, but if you want good sense, good nutrition, and good recipes, buy a book by Dean Ornish."
4,This diet is a lifestyle not a diet,"""The New Beverly Hills Diet,"" by Judy Mazel is one of the best diet books I have read. And yes it is a balance diet. The secert to any diet is fruit. Fruit is high in vitamins and high in fiber. The second secert to successful dieting is the combination of foods. I would have liked for Ms. Mazel to explain how to incooperate this lifestyle diet into daily living...fruit til noon, high and low carbohydrates at noon then protien and low carbohydrates with the evening meal."
3,Can This Really Work??????,"I've just begun my 35 day program and I can hardly believe that anyone could survive this without health consequences. A DAY JUST EATING GRAPES!!!! Judy Mazel says you won't even get hungry. That's impossible!!!! PRUNES THAT TASTE GOOD!!!! Yeah, right!!!! WATERMELON FOR AN ENTIRE DAY AND YOUR NOT GOING TO FEEL HUNGRY!!!!! I believe this might work, but I can't believe anyone can really do this for 35 days. The real question is this....The web site she talks about in her book doesn't exist, the 800 number she gives belongs to 2 guys in Seattle, and the other number is not in service. I called Seattle for info and they had no listing. What Gives?????"
4,Great for beginners....,"I've been a Note Broker/Cash Flow Specialist for 4 years now and I refer all of my trainees to this book. It's very detailed in defining the main debt instruments that dominate the industry and pointing you in the right direction of who to network with in order to generate business.The one thing I disagree with is that the author claims you'll succeed part-time. Like any other profession, this one requires a lot of time and effort. And anyone who has experience brokering anything knows that good brokers make dozens, if not hundreds, of calls per day. If you like speaking over the phone and have the time, then this business will easily add a good $20-$40K to your annual income, possibly more."
4,Helpful as it can be under the circumstances....,"I found the book itself very good with a lot of good suggestions and pointers for assessments. However, as all who are nurses know, it's impossible to please every administration. ""You chart too much,"" will be heard as much as ""You chart too little."" I think this would be a great refresher for many nurses stuck on making repetitive comments just to write something down, rather than really addressing issues noted during her/his assessment."
5,Do you want your dog to live?,"This product is excellent for dogs with osteoarthritis. It really works. My labrador is 16 and several years ago her arthritis was so bad she could not jump up on the couch as she was so used to doing. Also, her knees were making a clicking noise when she would walk. This product has rejuvenated her. No more problems with jumping or difficulty walking. She has been like a (older) puppy. You will need to be patient for the results...a few weeks perhaps and the dose should be about double or triple the reccommendation for the size of your dog. If you want your dog to have new life this product is perfect. Shop around for the best price! Joel Savitch"
1,Too bad for my pet,Did nothing at all to relieve my dogs problem. Even though I gave him the complete contents of the bottle. No change I'm sorry to say as I really hoped it would alleviate his discomfort.
3,Is this really a 90 count bottle or a 40 count bottle?,"I bought this product for my 8 year old pug with hip displasia..he seems to have responded well. I have one question....for those of you who have ordered this particular brand...the ad says ""90 count"" but the bottle pictured says ""40 count"" Does this product ship a 90 count bottle?Mine was a 40 count bottle, bought at local dog food store for less than this price."
3,"If you like Step, this is for you...","I didn't much like this exercise video. I should preface that by saying that the reason why I didn't like it is that I'm not the most coordinated person. I found the step moves to be complicated and annoying. I didn't get my heart rate up because I was constantly trying to figure out how to complete the moves. I have some other videos that use a step but none of them are this annoying. I was expecting a program that would allow me to use the ""fanny firmer"" to pinpoint certain problem areas but I didn't expect the video to be mostly used with the step. I have several The Firm videos but none this annoying. If you are good at the step, this also might not be good for you because it doesn't really seem to get the heart rate up, even if you knew all the moves. Based on this experience, I won't purchase any other programs where a step is in use."
2,Firm Fan Disappointed...it's too short and there is no sculpting,"If you are an owner of the fanny lifter and hoping to find another good workout DVD this is not the one. Although I really like Lisa Kay's style, I was hoping for more of a work-out. The video is a little more than 30 minutes and almost all cardio. There are a couple of times where you use light weights for arm movements, but there is no sculpting for the lower body. Also, expect to do the workout a few times before you familiarize yourself with the moves. It is hard to get your heart rate up before you know the steps. It does use the fanny lifter but a chair and a normal step would work just as well."
1,Poor product implementation,"The early Firm Videos were extraordinarily well done. This one does not live up to the past excellence of this company. Cutsey high coordination dance moves may look good being done by women who've taken dance classes but leave me frustrated and angry (I've done aerobics class for over fifteen years this sort of cutsey stuff is NOT NECESSARY) Give me a DVD that proveds a startup menu allowing me to bypass all the slow screen credits for the producer, director, photographer etc. etc etc. this was a deal killer and I returned the DVD for a credit."
3,Expected More,"Although the film was poorly cast, I still wanted to give it a chance because I wanted to gain a better understanding of the life of this great man. I was disappointed. In an effort to be ""fair"" or non-biased, the script neglected to truly capture the tenor of the times and the innate passion that fueled this man's life. I understand that Powell's sons were involved in this production. I hope that the project is taken up again by someone who isn't so close to the subject."
2,More average than I had hoped,"Haney does one thing really really well in ""The Right Hand of Amon"" -- the descriptions of everyday life as it may have been lived near the end of the 18th dynasty. Perhaps if one has read the series from the beginning, the characters would feel fuller, richer, more like people. However the sign of a great book is to make a newcomer to a series feel for the characters regardless of which book in a series is read first. I didn't feel much of anything for any of the characters. Likewis it seemed that the mystery was solved haphazardly with little evidence and more luck than anything and a satisfying conclusion came with a whimper."
5,A Great Present,"My dad is the kind of dad who has everything. I spent months and months looking for a Christmas present for him when i came across this book. He always talks about how he wishes he could go fishing more and this book was perfect for him because of all the different fishing spots it covers. It gave him ideas of all the different places to go that he has never been to before. I know he really liked the book, but i liked it too because of all the pictures."
5,"I dont read books, BUT I can't stop!",I can't stop reading this book! It's an effortless read with great info and nothing you don't need. I've spent over 5 years of my life in central cal and I feel as though I just discovered it.
5,LONG lasting,I bought two batteries a couple of years ago for my medical practice. They are still going strong! I would reorder these without any hesitation. It seems like they have actually performed better than past purchases of Welch Allen products.
5,Puts postmodernism in perspective,"Enemies of Hope is an engaging, energetic critique of the postmodernist worldview. Tallis shows there are important grains of truth in postmodernism, but the conclusions postmodernist thinkers draw from these truths are wildly exaggerated. Tallis clarified many issued for me. He ends the book with a convincing presentation of how enlightenment ideals should be recast to take into account the valid concerns of postmodernism. An outstanding work."
5,Terrific Book -- A Must-Have,"First, a disclaimer: Hicks and I share a publisher (Michael Wiese Productions) but we've never met. That being said, this is a terrific book. Hicks clearly lays out the elements necessary to create a tight, emotionally-satisfying thriller. He outlines the narrative structure of a solid thriller in clear, helpful language, and goes on to explain the characteristics of a strong protagonist and antagonist. He also offers an explanation of the differences between an action film, a detective film, a horror film and a thriller -- and he provides examples and script excerpts from great thrillers (such as North By Northwest and Breakdown) to demonstrate his ideas. If you want to write a thriller script, or just get a better idea of what it takes to create and structure a solid thriller, this is the book for you."
5,Worth every penny,"As a language arts teacher and story writer I found his analysis of genre to be absolutely amazing. Not since reading Marie von Franz and other Jungian views of genre and the shadow world have I found such clarity. Don't listen to those who put it down. It was obviously over their heads - as stated by one reviewer directly. If you understand Jung and psychology, you'll find this to be an excellent resource in the way Hicks creates the psychological levels of conflict resolution through his labeling of plot components and the protagonist's journey."
3,(...) promotion,"I think the first guy to post here works for Sony.Get real!Watch the reviews after this comes out.I will be getting it just cause I only have the downloaded version of EQ and this is a way to save money.The few minor extras are just a bonus.These will never have any collectors value and since they are making 45,000 as per the EQ site they will never be rare.Funny there are still lots of the first gold ed. still for sale.Good deal if you don't have all the games."
3,Good workout if you can find the products,"I didn't bother to read the reviews as I had seen this dvd recommended on a Web MD site. No where in the description of the dvd did it list equipment needed, so I assumed I'd need dumbells (which I have) and purchased it. Now I realize I need an expensive Fanny Lifter that doesn't even exist anymore. I can't buy it on Amazon at all which is what affected my rating. I'll probably try to sub with a cooler....I started with a step stool but it wasn't nearly tall enough for the sitting arm workouts. I even tried to buy directly from The Firm website and the Fanny Lifter is not on there AT ALL! Really wish there was more information in this listing since it is clearly outdated."
2,Not as good as other Firm Videos,"I am a lover of The Firm. I have had fantastic results with their videos, but this one I find very disappointing. I did not feel worked out afterward. It is broken up into 3 sections working the upper body, lower body and abs separately. It does not have the advantage of the other Firm videos that do more in less time by working the lower body along with the upper body. After each section, I thought ""Is that it?!"" However, if you are really short on time or just beginning, this workout may be great for you. It is extremely beginner friendly and can be easily used in 15 minute sections. If you want a wonderfully intense workout and can exercise for a full hour, try ""The Firm Body Sculpting Basics"". Another great one that takes only 45 minutes is ""The Firm Maximum Body Shaping""."
4,Great Family Devotional Guide!,"Though it's a bother converting the julian date, and the quotes from Pilgrim's Progress seem a little small in comparison to the commentary, this book makes for great devotional reading with my 10 year old boy. He enjoys looking up the two or three scripture references at the bottom and the prayer after that is always appropriate to the story above. Each day brings a new lesson in the Christian graces."
4,Don't buy this on Doug Kaufman's website,"I thought I was buying this book on Doug's website and instead he is selling a pamphlet (basically each chapter is condensed to one page)of less than 35 pages (and 15 pages is a questionaire such as ""do you drink alcohol?). His website shows a picture of this EXACT book without any information and has a strict no return policy. A small throw away pamphlet he sells for $20 plus $5 shipping. What a waste of money. Wish I could have read the book. I watched Doug on TV and was interested to get the book, now I just consider him a liar and a cheat. Of course his website wouldn't print this review but I am hoping Amazon will. Amazon sells this book for $35 so I thought $25 was a bargain. Should have trusted Amazon. So angry at being cheated."
1,Poor image quality,"This webcam by Creative Labs is not too good. The image quality is poor even by webcam standard, and it does *not* have auto focus, which means you have to adjust the focus ring each time you move. Unlike Logitech's ClickSmart, you cannot use this one as a take-along digital camera. And even Ezonics makes cheaper and better-quality webcams than this."
3,not a good introduction to haircutting,"I usually like the Dummies books (although I hate their name) because they explain the most basic information. This book seems to be adapted from a hairstylist's textbook and assumes a lot of background knowledge. The directions keep commenting on my needs as a professional, which I have no desire to become. And there are not nearly enough pictures for a topic so visual a topic as haircutting. I will be shopping for other books that are more geared towards the home haircutter."
2,No real help,"Book was no help in correcting problems or deciding what to maintain on a bike. Too high level and generic, tries to be all things to all bike owners, and fails to provide real help"
3,Used by New Foster Parents,"We bought this as prospective foster parents on the advice of our social worker and were glad we did when we received our first placement since we had no previous parenting experience. With that said, more and more you can find a million online sites that provide such information, and more current information, which is why I am giving it 3 stars."
5,Drug Smuggling,"This movie has tremendous social impact and will stay with you long after you have watched it. It is hard to believe it is fictional because you know as you are watching it that this truly goes on, on a daily basis, and it is difficult to turn away. While it may not be easy to identify with the title character, it is very easy to understand her motivations and how it could happen. It is slow but intense and very interesting. Years after seeing the movie, I still think about it and remember it well. It's an important movie and well worth seeing. If you're going to take the time to watch, don't watch the dubbed version but see the film as the filmmaker would want you to see it, in it's original language."
3,Recommended for a compelling evening's entetainment,"This film has been slightly over-praised in the critical press, but that's not the fault of the movie, only the fault of the lack of truly compelling choices in the multiplexes these days. As things stand, although ""Maria Full of Grace"" isn't all that original and all that ""off the beaten track,"" it does tell a fairly engaging story of a young woman with limited options who initially chooses a potentially dangerous shortcut to escape a life of quiet desperation, but then comes to her senses and tries to salvage something for herself. The movie especially benefits from good, understated, naturalistic performances across the board. The DVD features a fine, crisp image and a few modest extras."
4,About Mules,"This film effectively brings the world of drug mules to the big screen.A bright, albeit stubborn 17-year old Colombian girl stumbles upon the world of traffiking drugs into the USA through swallowing pills, and pooping them out.The film is paced just right, and it develops the lead lady's character quite nicely. There are some disturbing moments, as there should be, 'cause lots of disturbing things happen in this world.The acting was top-notch (except the 2 guys in the USA who recieve the mules--they were really bad actors), the script was great...a very fine film. I highly reccomend this to all drama lovers.And for all you rock/pop en espanol fans, there's a new JULIETA VENEGAS tune at the end!"
3,First Half - 4. Second Half - 2,"An excellent portrayal of how, after being given several opportunities to back-out, a volunteer drug-runner gets into the U.S., accepts the pay for her crime and then chooses to stay in the country illegally. The movie was very strong until the scene in U.S. Customs. It was there that it began to break down for me.It is a well acted and a thoughful movie, but it is, in a nutshell, the story of a criminal. The character could very well have been formulating the start-up of her own drug smuggling operation as she walks through the airport at the end. Sure, she most likely was not but I feel that the film ignores personal responsibility for her own actions, and made her out as too much the victim."
5,You can't miss this album,"Jackie Trent is known for her amazing songs and now that she's grew up she sounds better than ever. Of course, she is still being the best, and on this CD you can realize that I'm telling the truth. For her fans... now she's recording a new album..."
1,Pointless--just buy Pet Clark,"I bought this thinking it would be some original 1960s recordings of Tony Hatch's great hits sung by Trent, but it's all re-recorded with cheesy 1994 arrangements and utterly pointless. If you have Petula Clark's greatest hits, there is nothing of interest here."
1,Not Worth It!,"This is the worst hair setter that I have ever purchased! They get too hot to handle, but the worst are the flimsy clips they give you to ""hold"" them in place. They are so cheap that when you slide them in over the roller, they stretch; therefore, not holding in the curler. They fall out as soon as you let go of them!!!!"
4,Good --not as amazing as prior models,"It accomplishes the job rather well but, it is not as effective as the older model. Still the best I found on the market"
3,No dual voltage!,"I bought it in the hope to use it in foreign countries--so dual voltage is the key to me. But when I got it, it doesn't seem to have that function. So I called the manufacturer, and they confirmed that this model does not have dual voltage function. So don't be fooled by the description--call the manufacturer before you buy it."
4,A Great Resource!,"This is an extremely helpful book. The American History plays are perfect for middle school students, and can be used as part of a unit. I'd recommend this to use for both in-classroom plays and those for the entire school to view."
4,Another great package from Golden Entertainment BUT....,"The sound on ZOT is not very clear.... It might just be the film. The rest of the episodes are simply wonderful though... I even liked the mini story of Underdog that Joe Harris had made for his kids...I am not into Go Go Gophers and such, so I skipped them, but those are for people who are fans of those... SORRY...The Ticklefeather Machine was OK.... Not the best one of the bunch, but I did like the one about the famous painting and Shoeshine's true self is almost discovered...In future volumes... I would like to see more photos of the people behind the photos, or old interviews on their opinions of Underdog... All in all another welcome addition to my Underdog collection...."
2,"Only so-so, I would look at alternatives","I bought this instead of the iPod because it was so much cheaper. Unfortunately I wonder if I got what I paid for. The user interface is clumsy, especially while driving, which is my primary use. The unit occasionally locks up and must be reset, even though I stay current with firmware and driver upgrades. The size and shape is awkward, and I don't care for the design. However, it does work, and I have packed it full of about 150 CDs recorded at 192k. With my [$$$] ears compressed audio is fine for the car, but it still doesn't cut it for home listening."
4,Nice player,"This is a great MP3 player. I'm ecstatic about it. Only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because Firewire is flaky, but since I don't copy and remove songs from the player like crazy, USB works good enough for me. A must buy for anyone who has a lot of MP3s and wants one player to hold them all."
5,Awesome,"This is a great little product. Firewire connection works perfect ,software interface is good - had it up and running in 10 minutes, no problems."
2,What??? No random/repeat play?,"...My [inexpensive]CD player has random/repeat play, this $[money] gadget does not????"
2,"H. P. Blavatsky's ""The Voice of the Silence""","If you grew up thinking about western forms of philosophy & religion, then the eastern forms of spirituality in this book probably won't appeal to you. If, however, you are curious about what eastern forms of religion actually say, then by all means read this book.The East has its own way of putting religious concepts, its own religious symbols. As a result, this book didn't make much sense to me, even with Blavatsky's footnoted explanations. But I thought Blavatsky's introduction was very interesting."
4,Fun and Energetic Pop,"Undoubtedly, the cut ""Anything, Anything (I'll give you)"" is the favorite here. It is probably the only song by this band that the well musically informed person knows about. I'd say the ""average"" but, those people would say ""Who?"" at the mention of this band. It's a shame, because mediocrity too often rises to the top and garners platinum...while these guys get relegated to the bargain bin. That's good for us people who KNOW good music. Ths CD is fun, but not as outstanding as ""Vinyl"" in it's consistency. As I said in my Vinyl review...the standouts are the aforementioned, and ""Scenario"". ""Visiting the Zoo"" is OK too. The cover of ""Femme Fatale"" is OK, but I liked the REM version better. Still a great CD even on just those cuts alone, I'd STILL recommend it."
5,Great Film,"This movie is one of the best direct-to-video/DVD movie of 2003. The movie starts off doing parodies of ""Star Wars: Episode II"", ""Spider-Man"" and ""Jurrasic Park"" and the film gets better. This is a great film for all kids and die-hard ""Fairly Odd Parents"" fans."
5,The music makes my heart sing,"Two years ago I was recommended to buy this CD. This music has the ability to calm your nerves and gladden your heart. It helped me get through a year of dental surgery and repair. As I sat in the dreaded dentist chair with my CD player on my lap and head set on my ears, I was transformed to another time and place where pain couldn't touch me. Bless you Eko, where ever you are."
2,Not like the original,"I have always loved ""Eko"" but I was VERY disappointed in this album. Maybe if I had not heard the others I would have liked it, but I have every album Eko has made and this is NOT up to the usual standards."
3,"MJD story rocks, the others... not so much","Other reviewers have rehashed and summarized this anthology many times over. I was swept away by the James Bond gender bender in ""The World is Not Big Enough"". It might be one of my favorite short stories from MaryJanice Davidson EVAH.Its been three days since I read it and can barely recall what the other stories were about. Three stars because the other two didn't have the staying power, ""World..."" gets a 5 star on its own."
1,Quality has declined in recent years,I have been buying Geoffrey Beene shirts for over 20 years now and the quality recently has really declined. This shirt came with many loose threads and is not well sewn.
3,This shirt is large,"This is a good-looking shirt, but I got the smallest size and it fit like a parachute. I am near 6 ft, but I'm very slim, and I could wear this as a nightgown.In the end, once I tucked it in it was fine, the sleeves were just very puffy. Small people will have to get this shirt tailored."
2,NOT Full-cut,"When I found Amazon was selling full-cut dress shirts, I gave a cheer. Since Sears stopped selling full-cut shirts long ago, I have not been able to find such a shirt for anything like a reasonable price. The one I ordered is off-white, seems to be made of good cloth, but is far from being full-cut.It is well packaged, but not at all intended for those of us who are full-cut.In the future, I might as well go to Wal-Mart as their shirts are the same size and have a lower price.I do not remember the last time that I was disappointed with something from Amazon. Consider selling a real full-cut dress shirt.This is what I ordered:""Geoffrey Beene Men's Point Collar Full Cut Sateen Woven Shirt, Almond"""
2,Poorly Designed,"Pros:1. Great value2. Many styles and colors3. Good materialCons:This is a deal breaker.The length of fabric from the wrist to the shoulder is overly twisted and cannot be straightened. I purchased 3 styles of this shirt and it proved to be the same for everyone one. Do yourself a favor and just buy one and try it out, if you like it then maybe you got a good batch. I was a doofus and purchased three at once (against the advice of my amazing, all knowing and always right wife) and had to return all three.p.s. my wife made me write that line, it was not of my own volition."
1,Lowest Grade steel ever seen!,"I purchased this with great expectations. It is a chinese product that purports to be made from German stainless. When cutting bone in chicken thighs, the bone caused giant dents in the edge of the blade. Owning a variety of German knives, which easily cut a chicken bone , with no visible damage, I can only believe that this is a cheap fake."
4,For space manufacturing,"If manufacturing in space is ever to be practical, we are going to need serious and extensive research in how fluids (liquids and gases) behave under conditions of microgravity. Which is why this book is important.It details the boundaries of our knowledge in this field. And it comes at an important time. When the International Space Station looks like becoming established in a few years time. One of the justifications for the station was to expand vastly our knowledge of how indeed fluids will behave.The book's discussion seems comprehensive. Undoubtedly, the editor must hope that it rapidly becomes outdated!"
1,A book only a newbie could love..,"Nice, somewhat informative. Well drawn maps, but not really helpful to someone like a newbie who's lost and /shouting for directions. The average novice would find it useless I think. Yea sure it shows landmarks, that's if the person can find those even. Location grids are by far easier to navigate with and its very easy to get lost in allot of zones and not be able to see landmarks that could be familiar. I agree with ""This one Guy"", get a REAL map. Only good as a collectors item you ask me. Get better maps online."
2,Only if your a collector,"The maps laid out in the atlas are of little real use, other than giving you a very base idea of what the zone looks like. Each map is an artists veiw of how the area looks to him and then drawn in a scale that fits the atlas. Most harly usuable for any real gameplay. The information in the book may be of some use to people that are new to the game or not familure with some of the sites on the web that give the same info or in many cases more info.I would recomend this item for collectors only."
5,A great resource,"True the maps aren't that useful but that's not the reason this book was created. This book gives deep insites into the back stories of all the zones in the game as well as notable NPC's in each zone. Before I bought this book EQ was just a bunch of different zones with stuff to kill. Now I understand the MUCH MUCH bigger picture that verant wrote into this game. All in all I think the atlas has enhanced my EQ experience, and besides it gives me something to look at while the servers are down."
1,"Horribly boring, one sided Mormon propoganda","Do not read this book unless you are a Mormon who wants to genuflect on how justified your people where back in the 1800's in murdering all those innocent men, women and children. Incredibly boring, and one sided crap that has no business being published outside of Utah. Beware, if you dare to read this dribble. What a waste of time..."
4,Hurray For Bears Odd and Even!,I recently used this book with a 1st grade class to introduce the math concept odd and even numbers. The first grade class enjoyed the book and it also kept them engaged. The book is an easy reader and the kids can follow along without any trouble. I recommend this book with young children who are just learning math and numbers. The book does a great job in keeping the pattern of odd and even numbers clear to the children. This book can also be used with parents that are trying to help their kids with early math.
1,0 STARS: This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.,"The remake of ""Salem's Lot""- The Miniseries is literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. What more can you say? It sucks. I highly recommend the original 1979 version of ""Salem's Lot"" starring James Mason and David Soul to this utter garbage. What a worthless piece of crap this movie is."
4,Misterious and scary,IT is a misterious and scary movie that can scare anyone.One of Stephen King's best!The only bad thing about this movie is that it last's too longbut it is one of my favorite and scariest movies.
1,God-awful adaptation,"You cannot be a fan of Stephen King's classic book, ""'Salem's Lot"", and think that this was a good adaptation.Apparently this nightmare was supposed to be based on the Stephen King book ""'Salem's Lot"", but after watching it I was left wondering. It is very clear that there was a concerted effort to ""re-imagine"" and update the original story in order to make it appeal to a new audience, but fans of the book will hate what's been done here. When I heard that 'Salem's Lot was being made into a mini-series, I was very excited because it's my favorite King book. Also, recent adaptation have been good (The Shining) or even excellent (The Stand). But oh boy, what a let down it turned out to be. The flow of the movie is disjointed and inconsistent, and there are major deviations from the plot of the book. Not to mention how boring this thing is.In case you really want to watch this heap of crap, I won't spoil it for you. But wait until you get a load of how this things ends!"
3,needed less talking -more scaring,"I read the book as a kid and slept with a bible underneath my pillow for a month. Needless to say I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It was pretty good. It took some liberties of course. For a tv mini-series it had some creepy glowing eyed vampires. Rutger Hower was Barlow the Nostferotu. He wasn't as scary as I hoped. In the book, Barlow didn't have to talk his power was in his eyes, so is Rutgers. He should've just kept his mouth shut and it would have been more powerful and sinister. I liked Rob Low as Mears and everything else."
1,Not a good adaption...not a good series,"This was not a good adaption of the book, but that's fine, because it was an awful movie as well. I don't want to 'ruin' it by saying what was or wasn't adapted well, but if you're a fan of the book, this adaption misses the point of many of the most significant scenes. Rutger Hauer and Donald Sutherland picked up paychecks for 20 minutes of sub-par work; James Crawford utterly wasted his time; Andre Braugher did a decent job (though his character is so unlike the book, that it is unrecognizable); Rob Lowe mailed it in; the female lead character was so forgettable I don't who played it. The special effects? Great, if it was still 1982. And as for the plot, the movie does have vampires, so it shares that with the book, but that's about it. The movie isn't spooky, scary or dramatic. All in all, a complete failure on every level it aspired to."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!,"""Customer service was horrible! This company will not take back my order even though I just recieved it and was not given any information about Non-Return. The box that the item came in stated, ""30 Day Money Back Guarantee"" .... Found out this is not a true statement... Don't order from this company. HORRIBLE!! """
2,"Would not recommend, vignettes and does not lock tightly into the lens/filter","Cheaply made of plastic, it has threads to fit into the lens or filter, unlike the Canon Lens Hood I have for my 75-300mm which assembles into the exterior of the lens by pressureI don't recommend this product"
5,"From Publisher's Weekly, 2-23-98","readers will find the novel full of vivid characterizations of their favorite superbeings, gripping action scenes and notions of pure whimsy such as Planet Krypton theme restaurants. Maggin, a principal writer of Superman comics for many years, provides a model of how to turn comic books into fiction ..."
2,It's Okay...,"... but nothing special. It sort of reads like a first draft. There are plotholes and inconsistent things that should have been caught and fixed. The writing isn't bad, but it isn't great either. An average read."
4,Good read on a cold night.,"Always like Tess - she's pushy and smart - how good is that? Have read all Lippman's books thus far and this is a little less than typical - not as exciting as usual - but then, maybe I'm always expecting more - as in too high expectations. Nonetheless, it's a good read."
1,Not Charming,"I had a very hard time trying to get into this book. Finally, I completely gave up, and simply scanned the pages of the story.After I put the book down, and couldn't even remember the main character's name.I'm an avid and diverse reader. I read all kinds of books that fall under all kinds of different genres. I also believe in giving an author a chance. But, they only get ""1"" chance. If their book is a total disaster, I refuse to give them another try.I will never spend another dime on a Laura Lippman book. TOTAL [...]!!! I'm a writer. I would be ashamed to release such high-school level writing on the market.I believe you need more than just words on a page to consider a book good. A good read to me is being able to paint a great visual picture in my mind. I should fall in love with some characters, and utterly hate others.Please, save your money and don't buy this book."
3,Well...,"I am a big Eva fan, but the movies are...well...they seem to be designed for people who couldnt handle the depth of the show. Also it was made by a different company, Manga Entertainment, who im not a big fan of. You can also very easily tell where clips are taken from the show that were not put in the episodes and where they came up with new material of their own. All in all it IS something EVA fans should see. You might like it, you might hate it...but you should see it. Maybe rent it or borrow it before you buy it."
2,nearly worthless,"This dvd is just a bunch of recaps put together, and not very well. With either put you to sleep or give you an headache. My worst anim buy ever."
2,What Happened?,"Although Evangelion is an excellent anime, Death&Rebirth on the other hand, it well... not so good.It's nothing more than recycled material from the first few episodes. Other than that it is kind of confusing. I suggest purchasing the Boxed set it will satisfy your needs."
2,A Marketing Rip-Off!,"Ok, I'll cut to the chase: this disk is about 70% recycled content. Basically, they have taken the series and boiled it down to an hour and 30 minutes or so. Mind you, it is the better parts of the series, all brought together, but really, do we need to pay to see that after we've bought the whole series?My take is that they sought to break up the real movie (End of Evangelion) on to two disks in order to jack the price. The last 30-40 minutes is new stuff that tells of the story after the Angels are all defeated (read the synopsis). It IS fantastic stuff, probably best action in the series. The problem is that it ends at a completely arbitrary point that can hardly be called a cliff-hanger. Manga entertainment should have just added this to the End of Evangelion and called that the moive.One final gripe: the movie is in wide-screen, but it is not anamorphic.Shame on you Manga! It is clear that you boffed this one!..."
5,Best tasting snack... EVER!,"This is by far the best tasting ""junk food"" snack I've ever put in my mouth. I had heard a lot about this from my friends but hadn't tried it myself. Fortunately for me, I could lay my hands on a small packet and that was it. No other commercial snack (yep! homemade snacks by mom are the best in the world, this comes second) comes even close to the great taste of Pirate's Booty. It indeed felt like I got hold of some great booty when I tasted it. Get it, you won't be sorry."
2,"Make sure you count the bags inside! And watch out for hard, sharp bits!","I received a box with 11 bags, not 12. I noticed that another reviewer had the same problem. Also, in some of the puffs there are some really hard bits, which is weird. I hurt my tooth. I normally love this stuff but I won't buy it from Amazon again, even though the price is much cheaper than at grocery stores."
4,Some sizes better than others!,"Ok, so I have ordered the 1 oz and 1/2 oz bags and absolutely love them!! They definitely have a cheesy flavor and are delicious. I decided to order the 4 oz bags because it is more oz for your money. They aren't good at all! They have NO cheese flavor at all. I am very disappointed with this! I have contacted the company to see what they say about it and will update my review once I get a response. Don't buy the 4 oz. bags!!!Update**I contacted the company and they did send me a brand new box. It was much better! Apparently the 1st box I got was old!"
1,Buyer BEWARE!!!,This is a VERY poorly written book ... poor grammar ... extremely disorganized ... AND NOT EVEN AN INDEX!!!The rating system here is no longer useful. Avoid this book and look for something worth the money!
5,The Brothers Grimm,"Wendy Mass, as well as Gail Carson Levine, do something that the Brothers Grimm forgot: they give all of the characters names and porpuses. In the Brothers Grimm tales, we have no idea what the other character's (most often the prince) life was, which would have added better understanding to the story. I highly recommend the works of both Wendy Mass and Gail Carson Levine, for giving the second side to the story, or for adding reason."
2,"The ""PC"" police strike AGAIN","ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian ""Newsspeak"" toedit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon, for Pete'ssake, NOT some social/political statement.Nothing here needs to be edited or ""cleaned up"". Theseare simple ""good vs. evil"" stories with a happy ending,and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs,credits and all.And, if one is offended by ANY of this... then one mayexorcise one's freedom NOT to purchase such!Nuff' said..."
4,Underdog Boxed Set,"I was very pleased with my purchase, a gift for my grandchildren, and found the speed with which I received my purchase as well as the condition of the purchase, excellent. The cartoons have brought a new generation much pleasure."
3,Libro de texto,"El libro está muy bien como libro de texto de alguna asignatura de software paralelo. Está dividido en dos partes, teoria, y herramientas. La parte de teoria esta realmente bien (5 estrellas). Explica las diferentes partes del diseño y construcción de software paralelo, basandose en la metodologia PCAM.La parte de erramientas está totalmente desfasada (2 estrellas) muestra herramientas que ya hace tiempo que dejaron de existir, CCC o PVM. No contempla nuevas herramientas de software paralelo como OpenMP y similares. Únicamente el tema de MPI y HPF estan bien, pero no como libro de consulta, sinó más bien como introducción."
5,"Contrary to popular belief, melodies are American","I would refer any critics to '100 Years of American Dance Music' released in 1975 by the New England Conservatory Country Fiddle Band, directed by Gunther Schuler. There you will find melodies similar to the ones Jon used on this EXCELLENT selection. They are Celtic in flavor, but most decidedly American, AND all of them in the public domain. I believe this, as yet undiscovered by the masses, disc will join '3 Ships' as some of Jon's best and most sought after works. I'm considering buying a few more for the eventual ebay rush."
1,Want to warn you... the title is deceiving!,This is not an expose. This is an advertisement. Don't bother... you've been warned. The first reviews are obviously fakes....just like his healing and the title they call an expose. This is also 23 years old! I'm so mad!
4,process - oriented stride,"It ain't easy being number four. Anybody who knows and loves this music is conversant with Waller, Willie the Lion, James P. But Jackson is a major pianist. His approach on the 1944 - 45 solos is unique and fascinating. He begins with a fairly straight presentation of the tune and, each chorus, adds some new elements of harmonic and gestural detail. This is particularly effective on Limehouse Blues, You Took Advantage of Me and Sweet Lorraine.It's kind of schematic, but that's not a bad thing, and it reminds me of the proceedures of Steve Reich in his Drumming period. Jackson is clearly not really an improvisor - his performances are largely ""set"". But none of the Stride greats improvised so much, as you can see if you compare different recorded versions of the same pieces."

1,Tried the ASUS driver - no luck,"I unfortunately bought this card w/o doing a thorough search and went thru the pain of getting it to work. Would install and randomly lock up the PC 3 - 5 minutes after working.Tried downloading the ASUS package but it won't install. I wonder since mine is F/W v 2.00. Anyone else have luck with ASUS and v 2.00?Thanks, Todd"
3,Works fine - in some operating systems.,"I purchased this wireless card (specificly the ""b"" revision) somewhere else about a year ago. I realized then that official drivers exist only for Windows XP. However, I have made it successfully work in Linux and Windows XP x64.Linux - I use Fedora Core and the madwifi package. Supports the Atheros chipset on the card.

5,Underdogs Laugh in the Face of Failure,"With new octane poured into their fourth release, BaO has proven yet again that even without a big label backing they can write, record, and produce an album that succeeds those before it.The new dual disc release 'Laughing in the Face of Failure' is a combination of Song for the Underdog (disc Bullets) and new material (disc Octane) that without a doubt puts the Octane back in Bullets.Bullets is soaring into the darker catacombs of their souls with the determination to bring us all along for the ride... Now boarding flight 666 non-stop from Los Angeles to the Underground...From the evil undertones of 'Murder Maria' and 'Skull' to the dynamics of 'Bang!Bang!', 'Under my Thumb', and 'Chemicals' this album has by far exceeded my expectations. It's apparent the band is showing us where they have been and the direction they are heading into.Take warning 'cause here we come!"
4,"10,000 Black Men Named George","A very moving, truthful account of the horrid treatment of black men, in an era of Prejudsice and discrimination. When the governemnt 'freed' blacks, it wasn't true freedom, and treatment of them was horrid, as many people did not progress in their own ways, holding on to the whole 'you are beneath me' attitude. This should be shown in schools nationwide!!"
2,TO SHORT!!!! a disgrace to the original,It deserved 5 stars butThis was a good ending to the Anime series until they shortened it by almost 30 minutes. They cut out some very good parts that would of explained what was going on in a series Evangelion way. I suggest that you just buy the original Japanese version you get it all.
1,Rambling,"For anyone that does not import anime, this is not the true ending on evangalion. there is a FULL series after the way it was ended for all you stateside viewers.Don't listen to this. I was spaced out when I wrote it."
3,Disgusting,The perfect review for this movie is that of imperium2000. I totally agree with him and can't really add anything else. This end is not just confusing and irritating like the original but also is disturbing and -unlike the series- heavy with religious emphasis. It left me with a hollow feeling and I felt -quoting from Asuka in the movie-....................disgusted.
2,Horrible is an understatement.,"I loved the entire series. And even understood the last couple episodes which sent the average viewer scratching his/her own head. Yet this is garbage! No better way to put it. I bought this in hopes that maybe it would give me a different if not better interpretation of the ending of such a great series. In turn i received some ill found ""lets attempt to confuse the viewer"" acid trip sequence of a so called movie!"
3,Good but could've been better,The ending of evangelion... quite amazing and shocking I must say. I just wish that it would have been changed a lil when it comes down to the transicion between episode 25 and 26. A bunch of japanese subtitles that us the english speaking audience would like to know what the hell it says. But its a good movie I mush say.
1,Missing in Practical Geostatistics,The author does not show how to test for spatial dependence between measured values in an ordered set by applying Fisher's F-test to the variance of the set and the first variance term of the ordered set. What also went missing in this text is the fundamental concept of degrees of freedom.
3,"Ok, Staging is rather boring and so are the performers.","Is it just me, or does it seem like this production is rather ""static"", lacking change of emotion and any emphesis on emotion. The staging is terrible, which to me, if you are going to watch an opera, it should be as visually pleasing as the story and audio. The singing is good and so is the orchestra. I'm just not convinced that this is the best one to buy. I would like to check out another version of this opera from another Opera company."
5,A must read for world travelers,"The book starts in San Diego and whisks you off at the speed of a VW van to Mexico and Africa. The best part of the book is the honesty of Richard Ligato. He doesn't make you think its an easy trip, in fact, he and his wife Amanda have to overcome all kinds of obstacles. However, he remains very reflective and humbled by the whole experience. This book really draws you in to their world. A great read for anyone interested in traveling outside of the US. Lots of interesting facts and bits of trivia too."
4,Replaced Leap Pad with this,"My son got this for Christmas last year after his 7 month old Leap Pad wouldn't work anymore. I like the PowerTouch system better because it has no pen. The pen is what broke on my son's Leap Pad. Although I have to admit the software selection for the Leap Pad system is greater than the PowerTouch selection, the Powertouch is much more durable!"
2,Touchy surface,The pad is very sensitive to touch and often picks up my daughter's hand as she passes it over to touch someting else. She gets very mad and quickly puts it away.
3,Wish I'd Known This Before...,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. Her older sister has a LeapPad and I wanted to get my 3 year old the same thing. Then I saw this product and thought it would be better. My daughter hasn't even touched it. (The VideoNow Jr. seems to be a great hit though!)It wasn't until AFTER purchasing this product that I realized how hard it was to find books for this system. If I'd bought a LeapPad I'd have more options. I wish I'd read the earlier reviews about Fisher-Price giving up on this product and not having any new books for it. I'm probably going to end up getting a LeapPad and getting rid of the Fisher-Price system.
1,"Good idea, bad follow up","I bought this a year ago because the features and usability seemed much better than the Leap Frog. Big mistake! Apparently Fisher-Price decided they couldn't compete with Leap Frog and have abandoned this platform. There have been no new books available since I bought it (and there where pitifully few then), and FP has released a slew of other interactive toys. Those of us who bought this are left out in the cold. Thanks Fisher-Price."
1,Did not work for us,"I purchased this and some books for it for my 3 yr old, I loved the one at the store display. but when my son played with it, he would touch something on the screen and it woud say something different than what it was...thought the book was in wrong...so i tryed other books...same thing..thought it was the unit, changed it out. same thing. nothing worked for us, so i took it back...got something else for him. but i know its electronic, maybe i just got a lemon.."
2,"""The reader meets kate's breasts""","Vastly over-rated oscar hyped movie. Largely nothing happens during this movie.The first half-hour is kate and the kid in bed with about 30 shots of her breasts.Then there is a drawn out court process with little complexity or intrigue. The central question of law vs. moral responsibility in the concentration camp is interesting, although meekly explored. Pretty dull movie that doesn't cover any new ground. Over...rated Saying that, Kate does give a strong performance."
1,Fantasy,"Germans in the public gallery never ever shouted, ""Nazi whore!"" (or 'Nazi' anything else) during any of the trials in Germany of concentration guards. Give us a break! I can't believe they were able to slip that one into the movie without someone noticing it's pure fantasy. Beware of the propagandists with their not-so-hidden agendas! Also, it's an absolutely terrible and ridiculous film from beginning to end."
3,Well made nonsense,"This film is very well made, you believe in the 50s Germany shown, the actors are great. However, it is 2009, how long are we going to get movies about ""Nazi"" Germans? Again and again the world is reminded what Germans did 70 years ago. Now take the ""SS Camp"" premise out of the plot - would the movie feel the same? Say the protagonist would have killed someone in civil time and received a life sentence?But most important is this. The main character Hanna Schmitz prefers life imprisonment to being exposed as illiterate and thus saving her life. Is it because she all of a sudden felt the guilt to pay off, or was simply psychologically underdeveloped? In any case, 20 years later she admitted she didn't feel anything special about what she had done. One cannot believe that a human being would go to prison than to learn to read. This is where you stop believing the movie and realise it's a fantasy chick flick."
3,DOUBLE STANDARD..SEX W/MINOR,"DOES ANY CARE THAT SHE SLEPT WITH A TEENAGE BOY?? THE MOVIE WAS GOOD, BUT WHAT IF IT WAS REVERSED, AN OLDER MAN WITH A TEENAGE GIRL???"
5,Shades of gray,"To some this film will be a love story, for others it may be about horrific discovery about WWII crimes. To me personally, this is a film about one independent woman's tough choices she had to make for herself in order to survive. With no family, no education and ability to read, it almost seems that her life puts her in a way of making choices that always end up hurting her.Hanna is single, orderly, hard working. She is lonely and her incidental meeting with teenage boy Michael turns into a love affair that spans over summer months. They spend time making love and Michael reading novels to her until one day Hanna disappaers. Years later, as Michael is a law student at the local university, she learns that Hanna is on trial for the war crimes. By the end of the trial and her sentencing, Michael's and Hanna's life will be irrevocably changed forever.Beautiful film, wonderful scenes and tenderness that has not been captured on a film screen in a long time."
4,The Reader - 4 Stars,"The story is intriguing and the picture and sound are also very good. It is a serious piece. However, this is not a Blu-ray to own because of the sights and sounds (though they are done well). This one is about the story, which is how it should be. It is a good and provocative story a bout young love and growing up. You may not agree with the young man's choices (I did not), but they are certainly real and probable. I recommend this movie, certainly at a discounted price. I own it and am happy I do own it. Thank you."
4,You can't turn away,"A riveting, thought-provoking film. Winslet's character Hannah is numb, sleep-walking through life and Michael Berg brings her back to life, at least for a little while. Then we learn all the ""why's"" and become emotionally as torn-up as the characters by all the shades of gray."
3,Interesting story but too much,I liked this movie because it was interesting too follow. I liked the actors and thought the story moved well. There are some touching scenes. I did feel there was too much male nudity. I was like is this a porno or what? But It was moving because of my own love affair with a older woman when I was young. Although I also realized while typing this that the woman in this movie is a pedophile. But she is a woman so she gets a pass I guess.
2,movie review,the DVD was skipping tracks 20 minutes to the end of movie. i have sent it to wrong company (movie Mars). if they sent it back to me i will contact the proper company for exchange.
3,Quiet Night Snore Formula,"We bought this for my husband and he does not like the taste and aftertaste of it. The product contains cayenne and it does have a noticeable pepper taste when we take the pills (I take them now since he does not like it). It does seem to help though, but I thought Breathe Right products did a better job. It is a long caplet style? kinda smooth, but not the gelatin capsules, I forget the name. Not as big as a ""horse pill"" like prenatal pills or potassium pills, but almost. The purple plastic bottle is cute though - not sure yet how re-usable it will be (i.e. how easy the label will be to remove) - if not, then the local plastic recyclers will be happy to have it, I'm sure. The teddy bear is cute too but it has ""Quiet Night bear"" embroidered on its' belly. I'm not sure that I will buy it again since it looked to me like I was paying more for the bear than for the product."
3,Hard to use,"I would not recommend this product because the GPS is bulky and cannot be put onto your body easily like some other GPSs eg. Garmin forerunner products. I do like the watch as I am a huge Timex fan, and the watch is the only part we use anymore.The Battery in the GPS is almost impossible to get out... I consider myself a smart guy, but it did take me 4 attempts and about 2 weeks to finally get the batter into the device."
5,Beautiful Prints,I have achieved great detail and color using this product. I realy like the matte finish and the look of the paper. It reminds me of a smoothwatercolor paper.
5,Fabulous!!,I received this photo paper as a gift. Having tried many kinds and brands of paper in my Pixma 9000 this by far printed true color- crisp and clean. I was amazed at the quality of the photo! I plan on using this for everything. The finished photos look professional. Highly recommended!!!!
1,Pick a windy day and take $250.00 outside and let go!!,"Re my title to this: you'd get a better deal. This vacuum (can't say sucks it doesn't) Stinks. I have owned this vacuum for less than a year and it is terrible. Please do not waste your money as I have two kids and two dogs with this vacuum you need tweezers for fingers to unclog the brushes, and heaven forbid you vacuum more than a 2X2 square of carpet, it bogs down and gets really hard to push even on it's highest setting. I too have had the burning smells emitted from this vacuum when I vacuum more than one room. I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this, it would have saved a lot of time and aggrevation. Look at a different vacuum you do not get even remotely close to getting your moneys worth on this one."
1,I would never suggest this junker to my worst enemy.,The vacuum clogs in several different areas after one use when you have a dog that sheds. The spinning bristles stopped spinning all together after about 1/2 a year of use. I need a vacuum that can be used every day or so without breaking on me. The price spent on this item could have been put to better use.I loved the older Hoovers but this one has got to go.
3,Bought the Hoover despite the reviews,"I vacuumed with my old Dirt Devil and then a day later used my new Hoover v2. I thought my carpet was clean, but you should have seen the junk that it pulled out. I actually saved it to show my husband and mom. The dog hair and dust was like a thick lint. It doesn't seem tough enough to be 200 dollar plus equipment, but what is in this day of plastic construction? I read so many reviews I actually couldn't remember what had been logged in on the Target site. I did find very positive reviews under another retailer's site. What sold me was no belts, which drove me crazy with the Dirt Devil. Seeing the crud that is coming out of the carpet has motivated me to be more frequent in my vacuuming. Only time will tell on the cons, will report them if the come."
2,Horrible for pets!!!,"I bought this vacuum 3 months ago and have been extremely unhappy with it since then. In the first 2 weeks, the plastic holder for the hose attachments broke off. Recently the hose broke off. For [money] I would expect nothing to break in the first few months.In addition, we own two dogs. One is a Siberian Husky who sheds continuously. This vacuum cannot handle that kind of fur. The hard wood floor option is useless. It barely picks up the dog fur, let alone dirt. The suction won't even pick up bits of dog food.I would never recommend this vacuum to anyone. I usually trust the Hoover name, but not this time."
1,Do Not Buy This Vacumm Cleaner!,"We have been highly disappointed with this vacuum cleaner. The direct drive is simply too powerful for the plastic agitators. After a couple weeks of use, the plastic agitators become ""stripped"" and do not turn. We have owned for three months and have already replaced the agitators once and they need to be replaced again. My wife hates the vacuum cleaner and we are going to try to get Hoover to swap it out for another model."
2,Not for pet owners,"Like every other pet owner, I thought this vacuum was fantastic at first. Now the brushes have stopped turning. I took it apart and sure enough, the plastic inserts on the agitator brushes had disintergrated. The catch mechanism for the handle has also broken, another apparently common problem with these models. Until Hoover finds some permanent fixes to these problems, I would definitely not recommend buying the Windtunnel direct drive series vacuums."
1,Long hair is bad for the vacuum,"The power is good, but it is too heavy. It also cannot deal with long hair. The hair gets wrapped around the brush, if you do not clean/cut out the brush after each vacuum, you can risk shorting out the motor, like I did. After only several months, our Wind Tunnel motor is no more. I remember my Sears Kenmore that lasted 15 years or more..."
1,Do Not Buy!,"This vacume sucks! It is made of cheap plastic that is constantly falling apart! The cover to the light keeps falling off for some reason and the cover to the tools keeps falling off. I would definately not recomend this for pet owners! The hair gets trapped in this long tube and will never come out unless you take it apart. The filter has to constantly be replaced and is expensive! ($30) It is very heavy and bulky and hard to control. I haven't even had it eight months and it looks like I've had it 5 years because it is not made to last. Do yourself a favor and buy some other vacuum, any other one besides this one!"
4,"My thought on ""Zainaba""","This is a story about a nurse (Zainaba) who lives in Mauritana. Zainaba and her friend has established a training ""programme"" for traditional midwives living in isolated communites. As part of the ""programme"" they discuss female circumcision to the midwives. This story is very informing and interesting."
2,Poor customer service for Extigy,"I bought my Extigy along with the Klipsch Promedia 5.1 system and could not get the two to work together. I started working with Customer support online because their support line is NOT toll free. Granted you can't get an instant response to questions via e-mail, I decided I would be a little patient with this one. The problem was, it would take them 1 week to reply to each of my messages. Also, they would misread part of the problem and offer me suggestions that don't even apply. They would later apoligize for it because they realized they didn't read my issue close enough (BTW, I had responses from 3 reps, so it's not just 1 person who doesn't read). All in all, it's been over 1 month and I still don't have any sound. Now that's patience. It's too bad because it seems like such a cool product. If only I could use it, I could write a more productive review. Good luck with your Extigy if you get one."
1,customer service stinks!,"This item was advertised as a way of bypassing a defective sound chip on a laptop. That's why I bought it. However, it did not, as advertised, override my defective sound card. I contacted customer service through email (since they don't have an 800 number.) The first time was 9-15, the second time a few days later. As of today, 9-24, they still have not replied. I bought a Nomad Jukebox from them the same day through a different vendor and although it works fine I'm returning that too because of the poor customer support. This may be a good item, but I have no idea since the customer support is so bad. If customer support is important to you, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Midnight MESS,"A promising premise (reminiscent of stories in ""Under the Fang"") and a somewhat creative opening few minutes -- tracking a vampire apocalypse from the point-of-view of TV news clips -- are red herrings in this presumably straight-to-video release.Wherever the dividing line is between ""low-budget"" and ""no-talent"", this movie is well on the losing side. The acting is entirely amateur and ranges from the sub-par (for example, the goth youth collaborators) to the merely dull (alcoholic hero Father Joe) to the whopping ludicrous (Marvin Schwartz as a Catholic priest). The direction as such is incomprehensible.A dreadful, rambling script is partially credited to horror author F. Paul Wilson, who also briefly appears -- or so it says on the box cover.Don't be misled by the colorful video box! This trash is impossible to watch in its entirety, and not worth the wear on your DVD player."
1,Not what is seems,"You may find it interesting to check the reviews by the people who give this book five stars. None of them have ever reviewed a book by another author. Their temporal clustering is also interesting. I (who have over 500 ""helpful votes"" for other reviews) wrote a negative review that was removed. (First there was an extended e-mail exchange that resulted in Amazon agreeing that my review was within their guidelines. Then, a few months later, my review disappeared without notice.) Apparently the author of this self-published (per LA Times article) book won't tolerate negative reviews."
1,Not Made By Panasonic and not New ... This is a remanufactured/refilled cartridge,"After 1 month in use, bottom of cartridge fell and caused paper jam and toner leakage. Would give zero stars if could. Amazon was great about return even though official time had elapsed still allowed full refund."
4,Mother Gong - 'Glastonbury '79 - '81' (Voiceprint),"Until recently, I wasn't even aware of this early Mother Gong live archive release on Voiceprint. Doesn't really sound all that much different that the Gong spin-off band's later titles like 'Live 1991', '2006' and 'O Amsterdam' except maybe with today's technology the sound quality isn't as crisp - but very close. Tunes here that'll have you keeping this CD handy for a bit are the suitable opener ""Dogs"", the eye-opener ""Dreaming It"", the jazzy ""Robot Woman 1"", ""Beautiful Country"" (good flute playing), the sort of funky ""Robot Woman 2"", ""Machine Song"" and the seven-minute ""Searching The Airwaves"". Personnel: Gilli Smyth - vocals, Harry Williamson - guitar & vocals, Didier Malherbe - sax & flute, Eduardo Niebla - guitar, Trevor Darks - bass, Mo Vicarage - synthesizer and Ermano Ghizio Erba - drums. A nice pick."
3,"Very convenient, but sound quality is disapointing.","The size of this boombox is smaller than I expected, which for me is a good thing. The small size and ease of use make the unit very nice. Unfortanately the sound quality is disapointing. It sounds better than an AM radio, but much worse than an FM radio. Does not reproduce any bass or treble; it is very noticable compared to how my Sirius receiver sounds in my car or home stereo. For the talk channels like NPR and PRI it is fine, but if you are a music lover you might want to reconsider."
2,Don't get this if you can't put the antennae outside,"I bought the Boombox to take back and forth from work to home specifically to hear Howard Stern. It works in the front half of my house IF I put the antennae outside (but not at all in the back half). It doesn't work AT ALL at work. After speaking to 5 different tech support people at Sirius, I finally got the answer that I will not be able to get reception PERIOD without putting the antennae outside. Great! When it works at home I really like it but I feel like I wasted the $100 on it since it doesn't work the way I want it to. Had I known I would need to put the antennae outside, I would've gotten a different system. Sirius itself is awesome, all the stations are great and the car kit that came with the Sporster is perfect. This produce, however, sucks."
1,beware,"It was confusing. I wanted a BOOK to learn Japanese.""Playway Audio"" was not there(neither any picture as it displays now, or written or marked anywhere) when I place the order. I thought I was ordering a book and when I got the mail order, it was only a audio player.I got $17.50 restocking fee and $3.99 retrun label deduction and $0.99 shipping discount deduction When I returned the merchandise.I paid $34.99 for this audio player and when I returned..refund was $13.50.$17.50 restocking fee for a $34.99 purchase........Do you think it's fair????"
5,Very Helpful,"Although I haven't actually finished the book yet, I can say it is very good. You do get a basic understanding of the japanese language as long as you stick with it and practice often. It is very clear and well organized. You may feel a bit goofy while speaking out loud with the CD but hey its part of the fun. The japanese to english dictionary is exactly as they say, mini, but you shouldn't really be expecting anything much bigger since this is just a starters book so its all good. I'd recommend this to anyone who is planning on traveling to japan, it'll make you feel more confident speaking to the locals."
4,"Nice, but...","Well, here is what I have to say about this book. Being one of those common 14-year-old anime fans that I am, I decided I really wanted to learn Nihongo (Japanese). So, yes, this is a review from a complete beginner in the Japanese language. I have not yet finished the book, but so far I understand quite a bit more about Japanese sentence structure and customs. But, my problem is that I am not a very speedy learner, and this book does not help you much with memorization of words, suffixes, etc., but instead seems to be a bit straightforward, or something like that. So I have been stuck on chapter 2 for quite a while just trying to fully absorb and understand everything about the grammar basics and such. However, overall, this book should help any beginner in some way if they really stick to it!"
1,Not as advertised,This product is not what the picture shows. This is not the 'Kong' animated series. This the old 'King Kong' cartoon.
3,too thin,"Looks good but too skinny, and needs more tack. Good for reflector in daylight. Nice and shinny.Chevy Bowties Holographic Decal"
5,Exceptional and Touching,"I almost missed this film until my friend told me it was his favorite movie of that year. I ran out to see it and it is a gem! Art-film from beginning to end, this soft-spoken story comes alive and envelopes you in the realities of small town life. There are no ""villians"" or ""Heroes"" and the story has nowhere to go other than to chronical the lives of these people for a short time. It is so easy to care for these people.Afterwards, I took another friend to go see it as an ""emergency movie"" to a tiny little theater in Berkley (the only place that was still showing it, 48 miles away). After the film he stood up and said ""That was pure quality.""I agree."
1,Very elementary,"I was very disappointed. This book contained only the most basic information, and I did not find it to be helpful at all. It does not live up to it's title."
1,Review of Diabetes & Pregnancy,"This book was not helpful at all. I am a Type I Diabetic in the process of trying to start a family and I was looking forward to reading this book. It told me the same exact thing that ""what to expect"" pregnancy book does, barely mentioning diabetes topics. It did not ease my mind or give me any information on how my diabetes would be affected by pregnancy. The only thing they kept repeating was that diabetes NEEDS TO BE CONTROLLED DURING PREGNANCY. No kidding."
2,Entry Level Book,I bought this book in hope of gaining an insight to the increased insulin demands of a diabetic pregnancy due to hormonal fluctuations. This book only describes what insulin is/does. There should be a line on the cover stating that this book is only recommended for uninformed/newly diagnosed diabetics.
1,Bissell does not hold up,This is the second Bissell Product we have owned that has broken beyond repair a short time after warranty was up. The green plastic case broke where the screws attach it to the frame. Bissell won't make it good. This machine saw moderate use in a 2500 sq ft home with three carpeted bedrooms and the remainder tile floor.The machine did a fair job of cleaning but left dog hair in little tuffs on the carpet for later pickup. We found that the automatic concentrate dispenser was using twice as much concentrate as the formula on the bottle recommended. We finally just shut this feature off and mixed the concentrate in the clean water holder as other carpet cleaners do.On the second or third use one of the two belts broke so I stocked up. Now have a bunch of belts.The squeege attachment constantly came off when doing bare floors. We have a lot of tile floor and this feature was one reason we bought this unit. Big nuisance
1,BAD PRODUCT-DON'T BUY,"This carpet cleaner worked great the first few times I used it to clean our carpets. Pretty soon the soap and water didn't mix together and the machine was just spraying water on my floor. The machine still doesn't work. I called Bissell and the representative directed me to look at a couple items on the machine to make sure they were working right. He told me he would call me back to see if after checking these items out, my machine was working better. The items he directed me to look at were fine and no one ever called back. I feel like I am out a bunch of cash and stuck with a defective product. After reading other reviews I believe that I don't just have a defective product, but a poorly manufactured product. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Not so good,"It worked REALLY well for about the 1rst 2 months. I use it a lot, I have 3 dogs & a baby. It does not suck up like it used to, and that is the whole point!!!! It leaves the floor wet, and I can't keep everyone off of it for 2 days to dry. This is my second one, too, and it is doing the exact same thing."
2,Bissell PowerSteamer 1697 8804-T,"I purchased this Bissell PowerSteamer (#1697, 8804-T) in 2008 and have had it for two years. I am on my third pump ($30 each) so this is an indication of the quality of the unit. For the money ($150) this PowerSteamer would be a very good deal if the pumps did not continue to fail. The pump replacements are relatively easy to do if you are experienced but you have to almost completely disassemble the entire housing, which makes for a tricky repair if you are not experienced.It has a single beater bar for scrubbing, an adequate tool and hose setup for small jobs, no heating element and usually does a very good job, but the motor providing the suction of the water is not strong enough. The two belts (one for the pump, one for the beater bar) need to be replaced as often as the pump.If Bissell would put some quality control into the pumps for this model they would have a pretty good product."
1,Piece of Junk,"Thie is the biggest piece of junk I ever owned. The false advertising that it is a powersteamer; the only hot water is what you put into it. The lack of suction to pick up water and the fact that the solution cleaner will not dispense cleaner. I even contact Bissell to get a new dispenser after I tried to use it the 2nd time, and the new dispenser doesn't work any better than the first. I will do everything I can to discourage anyone I know from purchasing a Bissell product."
3,"Not bad, but quality issues","I have owned a similar Bissell steamer for 5 years. It definately makes the carpet cleaner, but takes a long time to clean a room. I usually have to refill the clean water tank about 4 times to do a 12x12 room. I had to return the first one I bought because it leaked water. The new replacement has worked fine, but as another person mentioned the plastic housing has broken in places where screws hold it together. I only use it a couple of times a year, so mine may have held up better than some that get used more often. Overall, it still saves money over renting a steamer, but there are probably better ones if you're going to buy one."
1,Very Disappointed with this Product,Reading the other reviews posted on this web site has made me feel much better than I did. Why? We were pleased with our Bissell carpet cleaner when we bought it but now it no longer pulls water from the carpet. I doubt we'll take it to be serviced given the reports that others have provided which reflect the fact that the repair expense wasn't worth the trouble as the machine malfunctioned again. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this product and will never purchase a Bissell product myself again.
2,So close but so far away,"I'm the guy who's nick name is Gadget! My phone is a Moto Q and I also use it as an mp3 player. I normaly go for a run and use my Moto HT820 blue tooth stereo headphones. They sound great and work very well with the Q. When I saw the S9 I though it would be an instant improvement! Smaller, lighter and newer tech. But what I experienced was Less than a quarter the Battery life (5 hours). Not super comfy... feels like wearing the wrong size stethoscope backwards. The technology did not work well with my Moto Q. Every button you press made an anoying beep. When the music went from track to track it made beeps and sometimes changed volume. Random volume changes was another problem. The S9 I had eventually stopped working. I LOVE AMAZON because they refunded my money! Well I'm back to using my HT820 and Love It! even if they make me look like Princes Leah or robbie the robot!"
2,Great when it actually works,Great when they work but they are invisible to all my Bluetooth devices now after sitting on the shelf for a month. No reason at all they just stopped broadcasting a bluetooth signal
1,Don't buy this product!!!,"It was good for about 2weeks then it just suddenly turns off by itself and can't be turn back on anymore even if charge.can't be charge anymore too.the first one I had I return it to Motorola an they change but it still has a same problem.the first one was worst it runs only an hour.NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS"
4,wireless headphones for ipod,"With a device like the Sony bluetooth wireless transmitter for ipod (not included), these headphones work great. I can listen to music on my ipod without wires! The ipod itself can be hidden from view, they say ""within 30 feet"" which is plenty of room to put it in your pocket, backpack, wherever. The basic music functions work fine: play, pause, rewind, next song, volume controls. The ear buds themselves are not the most comfortable I have ever used, but overall the product works great and connects within seconds to the transmitter."
1,Pointless!!!,"It looks cool but two things;1) It doesn't fit everyone's head and there is ZERO adjustability and the ear buds hurts!2) It skips!!! When you walk around (or even bicycling) it skips! The bluetooth connectivity does not stream smoothly with music. You pretty much have to stand still or put the phone within inches of the headphone receiver for it to work, lame!Don't get tricked by its look!!!"
1,bad headset,don't buy thisthis headphone sucks andbad sound qualityand the battery doesn't last longi have this but i am not using thisbecause it sucksand this headset is too heavy tooso i changed to Samsung SBH170 and this one is so much betterand cheaperif you are looking for one don't buy this but SAMSUNG!!!
4,Good for indoors,"Good for indoors, if you do weights in gym this will not suit you since u the behind the neck part is a nuisense but good for aerobics. Otherwise good, no cable clutter sounds is clear,fits nice, accepatable range , could have a little more battery life."
3,airly decent option,"I got these headphones to use with my Iphone (Now that it supports Stereo Bluetooth) overall they are fairly decent optionThe Good:They are affordableLow Profile lookThe Bad:The receiver is in the back (so for good reception I need to place my iphone in back pocket)They do not fold, so don't plan on putting them in your pocket"
1,Poor design,1. The headset is uncomfortable.2. There are gaps in songs where the sound fades out.3. Poor design. Within a short time the rubber arm came loose from the center piece rendering the headset useless. Not covered by warranty (no physical damage coverage.4. My experience with Motorola products is that shoddy workmanship causes products to break. All Motorola products are not covered for physical damage.
2,Going on pair #3 ~ Not sweat resistant at all!,"I love these headphones for working out. I don't love the fact that I have destroyed 2 of them already.It took some doing to get them to pair with my computer due to my Vista 64 OS and getting the right WIDCOMM Bluetooth stack.After about 3 weeks, the controls start tweaking out, the fast-forward and rewind activate even when not pushed; after about 4-5 weeks, the audio starts to decrease even with the volume maxed out. I work out for 2-3 hours, 5-6 days per week and I think this is causing the moisture to penetrate the electronics. This is the 2nd pair that has followed the same timeline."
4,"its a very cool headphone, i like it very much..","this headphone are very cool to hear your music via bluetooth, but when you answer a phone call is kind of noisy...but the music part is nice..."
4,Bluetooth headphones,"I like these alot. I only have two areas for improvement - I wish they were alittle louder, and I wish they had some form of battery meter. Dont get me wrong these things are minor, and I would definitly buy these again! They feal good, sound decent, and there are no cords - the range seems to be better than advertised!"
2,Don't expect too much,"Headphones quit in the middle of my third run. Prior to that I experienced frequent sound cutouts for no apparent reason (sitting, standing, running). Replacements have had the same cutout issues. Battery life is a real issue as it is fairly short <2hrs in my experience. Am not particularily happy with the headphones but want bluetooth for running so I will keep and lower my expectations.Motorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones"
3,"Comfortable, but not for everybody","Purchased the product with a bit of hesitation, wasnt sure about the durability of the product. The comfort factor is high, i have a large head and wasnt sure it would even fit. With a little adjustment and changing out the earbuds comfort was found easily. I have been wearing these for a week on average of about 4-6 hours per day. They didnt make it a week before one of the button pads started to peel off. It is in warranty so im not overly frustrated yet. I will update my review once i have dealt with motorola's customer service/repair personnel."
4,Motorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth active headphones,"A really good product! Only con is when using it to talk on, you only her the conversation is one ear.... but other than that, great!!"
1,Aweful bluetooth headphones,"Got them and opened the box. After holding them for a minute, I noticed the right arm was broken close to the back part. I thought, well, nothing hot glue cant fix, and that solved that problem. Took them to the gym and did a 1.5 hour lifting session with absolutely no issues linking up to or playing songs off my new iTouch 64GB player. Worked well with my off brand phone as well, just like it said it would in the write up.What it doesn't mention is the fact that when you sweat, all the controls stop working completely. I learned this when I went on a 30 minute run. I sweat when I run, just like any other person who runs. WHY on earth would you make a bluetooth ""Active"" headphone set that can't take any moisture at all? These headphones are an EPIC FAIL!!!DO NOT BUY THESE. I am disappointed and completely DONE with Motorola products all together. This isn't the first of their products to fail on me.GMR"
5,Works great with my IPOD,"I purchased the S9 because I was frustrated with the wire to my IPOD headphones getting caught on things, pulled out of the unit, earplugs jerked out of my ears etc. etc...anyone who uses their IPOD for work-outs or most any other activity that doesn't consist of just sitting understands what I mean. So far I have nothing but good to say about the S9. The quality of construction and sound are both top-notch. I use them with the Scosche IUBTT/IUBTTR Bluetooth Transmitter attached to an IPOD classic. I would buy both products again. I paid around 40 bucks for the S9 and it was money well spent.I have been using this for a while now and wanted to update...the S9 still works greatbut the Scosche died..purchased the Moto Ipod bluetooth adapter that plugs into the bottom of the Ipod and so far so good."
2,Great idea with problems,"I recently purchased this product from Amazon. Amazon was great, the product, however, was not. Even at the discounted price of Amazon the S9 is still quite expensive. The S9 has great features I really liked. The sound was good on my end but people on the other end said I sounded like I was under water and in a tunnel. My biggest problem though is that after only 3 weeks the phone and volume control portion of the headset stopped working. Volume control would randomly adjust and the phone button would randomly make phone calls. I would be talking to someone and the voice dial would go off. This would have been a minor issue if it only happened once but for 2 days I couldnt use the headset. I returned the S9 for another. Once again Amazon was great but sure enough afrer only 3 weeks it did the same thing. Sorry Motorola but this is a bust for me."
2,Good sound... PAINFUL fit.,"The sound of these Motorola S9 bluetooth earphones is pretty good... when it's working that is. I had numerous connection problems, but that's primarily due to the bluetooth stack in my laptop, not the earphones. I was able to successfully pair them with my cell phone and laptop most of the time. The stereo sound is good, comparable to wired headphones.My biggest complaint, which may ultimately lead me to return them, is the physical fit hurts my ears. I'm 6'4, 205lbs and have the smallest ear adapters (of the three that come with the S9) on the earphones and they still feel very large in my ear. I suppose they do this so that the fit is snug enough to get the earphones to stay on while working out. However, after 15-20 minutes, my ears really start to ache and I have to remove the headphones for a while. I use them mostly at work, sitting at a desk, to listen to internet radio."
2,"S9's work great, then fail every time, I'm on my 3rd pair","So frustrating. Pair fine with BB 8820, and work for about 3 weeks. Then one of the buttons stops working, then another, then another, until the thing is only good for listening to music at full volume, without changing tracks except from the controls on the berry. You call motorola support, and they want you to call blackberry and find out the technical details of what support for bluetooth the berry has....great, I'd love to do a technical support call on your behalf! Ughhhhh........great product, but fails every time."
4,"Omar Mukhtar: Lion of the Desert [ NON-USA FORMAT, Blu-Ray, Reg.B Import - United Kingdom ]","Excellent movie, excellent director and great actors. The blu ray is well restored, not exceptional. Has no subtitles and absolutely no special features. I would still recommended - blu rays with Anthony Quinn are way too scarce."
2,lion of the desert,"Was expecting a DVD,di not realize I ordered a VHS.The sound quality was poor,could not hear all the dialogue and the color quality was not good."
2,This is a propoganda movie!!,This movie was commissioned by Gaddaphi as a piece of propoganda to portray the courage of the poor persecuted Bedouin against Italian Imperialists. The battle scenes are excellent but really the script is shallow and the movie drags too long.
3,Decent,Don't have enough energy to fill out about this movie and it's not great enough in my mind to recommend other people watch it. I'd recommend to simply check it out from the library as I don't think I'd watch it more than once every 10 years or so.
4,Forget the Politics; this is a good film!,"Regardless of the fact that this movie was financed by Qadaffi, this epic starring Anthony Quinn, Oliver Reed, and Rod Steiger is still worthy of a viewing and, if interested, a purchase. The scope of the film makes it comparable to the more critically praised ""Lawrence of Arabia"" with an awarding-winning performance from Quinn. I viewed this one in a sparsely crowded theater over twenty years ago and found it to be one of the best of the genre. Unfortunately, the large historical epics were on their way out at the time in favor of more teen-oriented fare. Hopefully, the ensuing years may be kinder and the movie will garner some attention as being more than a curiosity, as mentioned by an earlier review."
1,Bad guys!!,"Please, do not buy this DVD burner, It only burn Sony DVD, I tried 3 model's DVD and I couldn't burn it.On the box don't said nothing, and at the instruccion said that this burner not burn some DVD types.Try with.SONY DVD+RWSONY DVD-RSONY CD+RW....So. It stinks out."
2,"Good, but...","Works good, but leaks. Whoever designed this at Bissell needs to take a look again at their drawings. They failed to pay attention to this little detail. I probably won't recommend this to others unless the leaking problem has been fixed."
2,not recommended,"I had an older version of this product which developed a leak, which meant that every time I attempted to use it, there was water spraying all over the place. Being gullible, I bought the pro-heat model a couple of months ago figuring that the new product version would work better. Wishfull thinking!!! Aftter the third time I used it, the sprayer was clogged and I still don't know how to fix it. The instruction manual doesn't tell me how to remedy the problem. Furthermore, the Bissell website link to authorized repair shops doesn't work! Currently, I am forced to use the vacuum element of the machine while carrying around a water filled spray bottle and a can of Spot Shot. This is ridiculous! I read the negative comments on this website and decided to go ahead and purchase the product anyway. I wish I had listened to the reviews before wasting $100 on a useless piece of garbage!"
5,Great for pet spot cleaning,"I gave this a 5 star rating since it served it's purpose without any problems. Beware though, the chemicals can be expensive (at Sears anyway). And actually I didn't even use a Bissell brand carpet cleaner. I used Kids 'N' Pet's all purpose cleaner and it worked like a charm! Plus, it's safe for animals. I would recommend this for quick pet clean-ups. I mean you can't really expect something this small and portable to do the job of a Rug Doctor. I thought it was worth the money and very easy to use. I would recommend it. It will save you $$$ on renting a Rug Doctor and buying chemicals."
4,About to get a 3rd one (despite problems with first 2),The first one I bought leaked through a seam in the bottom. Since this occurred within the first 90 days I was able to get it replaced at Target. On the replacement the sprayer stopped working after a year (weekly use - 5 cats in house) so I've used a water bottle to spray the carpet for the last couple of years. Now the cleaner has started leaking from the same area out the bottom. I'll replace it with another soon since it does clean very well. It's so much easier and better than using paper towels or towels to clean the carpet stains. I'd give it 5 stars if it were more durable.
5,great little machine,"Great machine does what it says it will do, would recommend to anyone with pets!"
2,Not Happy,This cleaning machine worked great when it was brand new and I left it sit just as the instructions say so it is always ready to use. Then one day I wasn't getting any solution spraying out and I had a real mess to clean up! I took everything apart I could including the pump and cleaned it but it still doesn't spray. I give up!
1,Broke right away! Bad customer service! Buyer beware!,"Little Green worked well...when it worked. Spray unit would not work after two uses. Attempted all trouble shooting tips listed in manual. When it still did not work, tried to call customer service number. Waited in the quque for 45 minutes then was kicked off the system. Tried to call again and only reached recordings. Another wasted appliance to add to the landfills."
1,Great...the 1st time,I used this machine to clean my furniture and it worked great. At least until I pulled it out to use it again a few months later. The hose that dispenses the cleaning solution is clogged and won't spray. I've tried everything and haven't been able to get it unclogged. This product is a bit pricey for a one time use appliance!
1,Waiste of money - don't buy ths product,"I am very disappointed by this product. The water doesn't get hot at all, there is definitely no steam involved. I cannot control the waterflow, it just shoots out on the side of the hoase instead of the front. I tried to use it in my car, and now the whole car is wet! The hoase is way to short for effective usage and the brush is difficult to clean once you are done. Don't recommend this product!"
2,Issues...,"When it's working, it works pretty well. But mine clogged up after a very few uses. I tried following another users advice by running CLR through it, but to no avail. This is too expensive for such failure.The ProHeat fuction is laughable. It doesn't get any hotter or stay any hotter really, than the water you put in it.I never got to use the turbo thing, but since the brush isn't powered by a motor, it probably isn't worth much."
2,Overpriced ...too little work,"I hate this model. I am on my third one. It clogs up easily. I have found that you have to totally clean the unit after using, and hope that the sprayer is going to work when you go to clean the next time. I have started spraying on the cleaner myself, and just letting the vacuum do the cleaning up. OR, I just pour the cleaner on a heavily soiled spot, and then vacuum it up. I would NEVER buy one of these again. Very poor design for the money. I would rather use a full sized cleaner with an upholstery size nozzle for small spots. This is definitely not worth buying!"
1,So not worth it.,"By the third use this spot remover stopped doing its job even a little. Had slight success the first couple of times using it but even then it always leaked. I have to set it on a towel to soak up the water that leaks from the bottom (and yes, I checked all the seals and the tank was on correctly). I get better results scrubbing stains by hand then vacuuming later after they've dried. This Bissell's goin in the trash."
1,No more pumping,"I had my Little Green for less than 10 months when the pump stopped working. It was less than 1 tank of cleaner that had gone through it, and now nothing."
2,The heat only seemed to make problem worse.,"The machine cleaned well, before the company included heat...It just clogged things up & needed repair. Technician told me that it wouldn't pay to have it repaired again, cheaper to just buy a new one, cause the heat would keep clogging up the works! I'll stick w/ the old model, one which has no heat."
3,Little green machine --cleaner?,"We like our Little Green Machine, we have an older model and really do not use it too much. I have a question that I hope someone can answer. Do I need to use the Bissell Cleaner or does another brand work? I have some Sears Carpet and Uphostlery Cleaner? Does anyone know if that would work or is it too caustic, or cause other problems?Thanks very much."
2,Worked initially then clogged easily,easily clogged no longer can spray cleaner. got rid of after a few months.
3,quality problems,"I've used our LGM many times a week for months now to clean up after dogs and daughters. Its a great concept marred by quality problems. The turbo brush was so weak it was useless. I tried it once and never used it again. Get the cheaper version without it. Both canisters have a tendency to leak. The sprayer sometimes sprays great and sometimes just piddles the liquid out in blobs. Clean up is a bit of a pain. I really want a retractable cord version. But for cleaning up pee spots, a portable spray vac is a must. Our carpets actually look better than before we got the dog."
5,Spot removal,My son and I were opening some art paint and splashed it on the beige carpet. Used a whole bottle of spot remover and blotted only to spread paint farthur....by the end of the night we had two huge grey spots....Went out to buy the green machine today used it a few times and it was very easy to operate and the spot is gone!GREAT PURCHASE machine pulled it all out! with 4 pets and a almost white carpet(not my choice) it will come in very handy I went and did all the spots today and they are all gone its wonderful great purchase.
1,Bissell 1425B,The Bissell 1425B that I purchased only worked for 1 year and 1 month. The pump for the sprayer stopped working. I took it to an authorized repair shop and was told that many of these 1425Bs' had been in for repair and the cost was more then a new one.
3,Historic Violin Recording,"Although interesting from an historical point of view, I found these CD's almost unlistenable due to the quality of the recordings (old). There is also an unrelenting hiss in the background."
3,Unsure,"At first this book seemed to be very interesting, with Kinsey hunting down Wendall Jaffee in Mexico, and stumbling upon him. But after the first part of the book, too many characters were introduced that had promise of being interesting but weren't explored up to their potential. It was almost distracting to build up these characters, only to let their stories lag or not close up at all at the end. For example, what becomes of the remaining Jaffees, especially Brian? And what does Kinsey decide about meeting her long lost family? I also was disturbed by how carefree Wendall was when he met Kinsey, not the slightest bit scared or afraid of what she would do. Also Harris Brown, just offers her up info without being afraid she will go to the police. I think it was unrealistic how much information these people just gave up to Kinsey. It was a decent read though."
3,I wouldn't recommend it to newcomers,When Sue is hot she's hot but when she's not she's really not. I thought the book started off with great promise with Kinsey in Mexico and getting herself into trouble as only she can. Then the plot cooled off and began to drag it's feet and after awhile i didn't care bout what happened to Wendell anymore. I don't think this book should be read by newcomers to the series but by people who are already familiar with the series as it is pivotal in revealing parts of Kinsey's past.
2,Not the best in the series (so far),"This is the 10th book in the series and so far the weakest (""H"" is a close second). There wasn't enough ""mystery"" or ""suspense"" in this one. I hope ""K"" is better."
1,Sour taste in the salad dressing,"If you'd like to know the pungency of the oregano in the vinaigrette Kinsey Millhone pours on her salad in the restaurant, or that her seating companion on the airline flight turns down her mouth too much and wears purple with brown, or how cats rub against her toes when she wears sandals, this is the novel for you. Or, if you want a textbook of what a successful author does when she gets lazy and needs to meet a deadline, this is the novel for you. If you want a cohesive and exciting story, however, look elsewhere."
5,No murder,"Actually somebody has been killed by the end, and Brian may have been involved in a murder but the core plot is about embezzlement and a man who fakes his own death.This is one of the most psychological and philosophical ones in the series. The con man is trying to re-establish a relationship with his family and Kinsey Milhone's long-lost family is trying to re-establish a relationship with her. Henry's bother William is also trying something. The counterpoint and parallels are pointed out, and even to some extent I would have to say, the point is labored. As usual there are a multiplicity of other sub-plots.All of Grafton's penetrating humor and careful description of every sight and sound and smell and taste. Fans of the classic hardcore hardboiled classics, of Highsmith and of ""Double Indemnity"" might find it slow, and fans of Hannibal Lecter not bloody enough."
3,LIFE IMITATING ART,"METHOD is really two movies in one: we see a movie crew making a movie about a crazed lady who kills over 40 wealthy men for their fortunes; and a movie about the actress who takes on the role and becomes morbidly obsessed with it. These two storylines intertwine and we become wary on just what is reality and what isn't. Elizabeth Hurley does well in her role as the has been actress looking for a comeback; Jeremy Sisto is good as the actor who is also her ex-boyfriend. When murders occur during the filming of the movie, the viewer is left to posit who is the culprit? Although it can be confusing and the resolution somewhat iffy, METHOD captivates the audience with its intriguing dual storyline."
2,"I'd buy it,but...","I see that the timings of the songs are listed here, and according to it,this CD contains the 4 minute ""edited album version"" of ""Spill The Wine"" instead of the full 5 minute version. I counted the total timings & saw this CD is about 56 minutes long. Why on earth put the single edit here when there's plenty of room for the full version? I'd gladly buy this album if only it had the full ""Spill The Wine"". I already have the short version on my ""Best Of War & More"" CD."
1,Do not waste your time,Not much of a movie at all. Acting was very bad and the entire movie was a waste of my time.
4,A good read for those with diabetes,"A great followup to Doug's other books which continues his discussion about the problems fungi can cause in our lives. Interesting information for all patients with diabetes to consider. Doug does a good job researching his information and has helped many people fight their illnesses. While not a substitute for other treatments, I believe it's important to consider as many options as possible.Shawn Messonnier DVMAuthor, 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog, The Allergy Solution for Dogs, and the award-winning The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats.www.petcarenaturally.comwww.pettogethers.net/healthypet"
1,Lexar no-go,"Just wanted to echo the other reviewer's comments that this ""Universal"" reader does not read the translucent Lexar memory sticks. It does work great with the Sony 16M stick that I have.Unfortunately, I read that review after I bought it. Back to the store it goes."
5,"Stylish, Comfortable, and of great value",These shoes look great and they are comfortable. I am thinking about getting a 2nd pairs in different color. Highly recommend.
1,Love the Actor - Hate the book,"I was very happy to see a book about one of my favorite movie actors.It was maddening that it was written by his siter-in-law, who obviously has an ax-to grind.You might get the facts, but not the truth from this ""Biography""See his movies instead of paying for this junk, as I have.Room at the Top, Manchurian Candidate, Summer and Smoke etc.It is odd that she does not reveal the nature of her relationship to LH in the narritive----I suggest reading it if you would like to know names dates etc., but do not expect a balanced insightful portrayal of an artist, that this author probably was resentful of."
2,"Fair colection, NOT GREAT",The proablem with this colection is that it is limited to variety in earlier anthologies. Many of the best are missing!!!!
1,Avoid the audio version,"Collectors interested in hearing the authors read their own stories might enjoy this production; but if you want to appreciate the stories for their own sake, steer clear of the audio version. The decision to use some of these authors as narrators was a huge mistake. Jill McCorkle's dreary monotone could sedate a grizzly (don't listen to ""Theft"" while you're driving). James Alan McPherson is essentially unintelligible. He does a poor impersonation of Demosthenes having a bad pebble day. If you really want to hear these stories read by someone, give yourself a break: buy the book, and read it aloud. You'll do a far better job than this crew."
2,NOT THE BEST,"I AM A FAN OF BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES SERIES, BUT I DID NOT ENJOY THE STORIES CHOSEN HERE. I STARTED AT THE BEGINNING, TRIED THE END, FLIPPED THROUGH A FEW IN THE MIDDLE AND FOUND THEM DISAPPOINTING. THIS SERIES WOULD DO BETTER WITH MORE THAN ONE EDITOR TO MAKE THE FINAL CHOICES."
3,This isn't it,"I assume there is a reason for progressing through the century in a chronological fashion. On the other hand, there is a predictable flow from Jewish stories, to war stories, to Depression stories, all the way to AIDS stories. To that extent, the title of the book is a misnomer. Maybe some of the older stories were great at that time. By now the writing seems old fashioned and out of sync. I am missing many of the great authors of the post-war years. Maybe they fell victim to the chronology.But mostly it is a matter of taste. If you like the stories published in ""The New Yorker"", you will probably love this book. If you do not like sensitive, pastel-like, washed-out stories, then you should look elsewhere."
2,This Book Had to be Done ... Or Not,"An alien picking up this book to learn about 1900's American short ficition would draw the following conclusions: (1) Everyone's dying. (2) There is no humor. Some country!I did like 5-6 stories a lot, making it percentage-wise little better than picking 55 stories out of a hat. My own list overlapped Updike's in one place (""The Things They Carried"").The real problem: the exercise was misguided. Too many excellent short stories did not appear in Best American Short Stories of 19xx, which was the criteria for making the first cut here. (Best Essays of the Century doesn't suffer from this problem.) At the very least, they should've been picked by a committee - committees are horriby bad at designing airports, but really good at picking Best lists. This book is a worst case scenario."
2,product support and customer service is terrible,"Sony VAIOs perform well when they are working right. I have two. But when they are not, watch out, you cannot get any direct support at all. I have visited their web site numerous times to look for troubleshooting support, I have emailed and I have called(but you have to pay!).Incidentally, I also own two Sony handycams and when I needed product support the same thing happened.Product support is important and if you can't get good support or any, then that says something about the manufacturers concern for their customers, too."
1,looks nice..BUT,"Terrible terrible support. If you buy I hope it does not go wrong or you are in real trouble. To be honest I will not buy Sony again, waranty is not worth the paper it is written on."
2,A luke warm vaio owner,"All in all I like my vaio. Given the range of options and the amount of money I had to spend and also considering my needs for a laptop the fxa47 was the correct solution. I must say that the vaio runs Maple 7 (a symbolic math program) rather well. A 1 GHZ processor definately helps for numerical simulations (lots of number crunching). However ever since day one I've had to deal with lots of random anoying computer quirks such as: spontainous crashing from being left on too long, crashing intermintently when running windows media player, and problems with xp and the dvd/cd-rom/cdr. All this within two weeks of owning the laptop. The only reason why I haven't returned it is that it still does what I really need it to do: crunch numbers that is run numerical simmulations. ..."
4,More adventures of Frasier,"Kelsey Grammer began his fifteenth season overall on Frasier as the hilarious and somewhat wacky psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane in the fall of 1998. Frasier was still in the Nielsen Top 5 during the 1998-99 season. The late Carroll O'Connor's legendary role of Archie Bunker on CBS's All In The Family and Archie Bunker's Place didn't last as long as Frasier. This same season,Grammer's Cheers co-star Ted Danson became the star of the new CBS sitcom,Becker. Danson's character is in the health care field as well."
3,CONTRIVED,"I'm a big Frasier fan. However, I do feel the series fell off its high standards (as one of the greatest TV shows ever) by Season Six becoming, to me, a very contrived show. During Seasons one through five nothing, on television, was (to me) any funnier than the sitcom of Frasier. But, I'm afraid, by its Season Six (to me) things seemed to deteriorate with situations becoming forced in order to just get a laugh. The characters were still wonderful; however, the situations and circumstances they were put in seemed, to me, to be obviously ""set-up"" for the laugh. During seasons 1-5, I never got the aforesaid feeling; those seasons were just consistently hysterical. In Season Six there are certainly some laughs to be had; nevertheless, the laughter, for me, was not as consistent as in the previous seasons.In light of the above, this will be the last season of this great series that I will purchase on DVD. I truly feel that the series should have ended at Season Five."
4,This is excellent for travelers,"I have a chair cover rental business and thought this will give me a break. The chair covers are made of polyester and dacron and unfortunately it does not work well on this kind of material. I tried it on any other cotton based material, and it works perfect. I believe it is the perfect item to take when you travel. It works like magic on cotton."
1,Not enough drugs,"This review is just for those who don't have any interest in Warhol to begin with or who have no emotional/personal relation or connection with the subject matter..This is abolutely not worth watching.People sitting there, doing nothing, along with a mediocre soundtrack of music sounds, sounds trying to be music...I'm sure plenty of people love, admire and or appreciate this work, but for me, having not done a whole lot of drugs in my life, and not having grown up in the culture, it does nothing but cause me to write a review warning others like me to stay away."
2,was not compatible with A707 sync,"It probably would have been a great deal even with the outrageous shipping, but once received I tested it out and it did not charge my phone. The product does work, but not with the Samsung A707 Sync. All in all the shipping time was excellent."
2,1960s Pop Theology,"I read this book many years ago as an undergrad, pre-seminary student. It's a rehash of standard academic tropes on Nietzsche, Camus, Kafka, and other existentialist forebears. Spend your dime and your time on the original sources, not this lightweight distillation."
5,great fun,"I love music, and this cd is a wonderful addition to my collection. You can never have enough fun, and music always sets the mood."
2,not what I expected,"My husband and I enjoy Celtic music. There were maybe two songs that had a Celtic sound to them. They have Disney princess like voices, which is not what I was looking for."
4,Great music,"I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas, only knowing she wanted it and having never heard this group before. I must say it's an awesome CD though. Both myself and her dad have grown to really enjoy listening to it with her (and regularly try to nab it from her!)."
5,christmas joy!,Was very excited to find this product so soon after seeing the PBS special. Not only that but both items I was looking for this one and the new regular CD by the Celtic Women were listed together. Wonderful sound!
5,Celtic Woman- A Christmas Celebration,Fantastic! Beautiful music. This one will be one of my favorites for always.
5,Excelent,The Christmas Celtic Woman DVD is heavenly beatiful and definitely fits what we'd like to see in the season.
5,"People who don't usual like musicals, will like this one!","I'm 19 years old and the first time I saw this movie was on my grandmothers TV. I was about 13 when I first saw it and at that time, I had no interest in musicals. I thought they were corny and stupid. Well this movie just happened to come on and since there was nothing else to do , I actually watched it. I was glued to my seat the whole time. This one movie made me more interested in musicals and I'm a fanatic to this day. I have the video and I've already worn it out, watching it so many times. I know all the words to the songs, and I've even seen the theater production when it came into town! This movie is the greatest and I suggest you see it!"
3,"beats, beats, and more beats...","This is a good album, but it certainly isn't for everyone. All three pieces on this recording exploit an interesting sonic phenomena (as described in the editorial review, so I won't repeat it here), albeit in slightly different ways. The differences between these works is so slight (save for instrumentation) that it's frequently hard to tell them apart. There is music here, but the listener is forced to find it between the waves. If you REALLY love slow-sweep pure wave oscillators and controlled acoustic 'beating,' this disk is for you. If not, be warned; this is not an easy listen, even when compared to some of Lucier's other works."
5,This is the one!,"After buying and returning 2 cd-read/writers -HP, Philips-this TDK VeloCD worked without a hitch. No software problems,no compatiblility problems. Nero(for burning cd's)works very well. It's not as windows-friendly as Adaptec but its stilleasy to use.

3,"Well written, but...","This book is a layman's introduction to symmetry in mathematics and physics. And it reads well. But sometimes it seems that although the author is correct in his mathematics, his knowledge of physics is somewhat flawed -- a definite shortcoming, since the book itself emphasizes the physics as compared to the mathematics. (He doesn't get to group theory, which is the main mathematical basis for discussing symmetry, until Chapter 8!)I'm not recommending an ""instead-of"" book, since I haven't found one I really like better. But i come away with a definite feeling of disappointment."
3,Pauses between tracks often wake my baby up,"I wanted to block out noise in my house to help my baby sleep, but I found that CDs of white noise didn't work because of the pause while the track repeats. This CD has a fade in and fade out for each track, which is good, but it means that there's about 10 seconds of quiet when other noises in the house could wake up my baby. Also, the tracks are each only about 7 minutes long, so the 10 seconds of quiet happens very often. I ended up buying a sound machine by Homedics instead, which plays sound continuously.However, I gave this CD 3 stars because I liked the sounds on the tracks. It's a great variety of soothing white noise and everyone is bound to find a few that their baby likes."
3,Tastes great,Not sure how this protein rates as far as muscle gains. I like the taste but not amazing muscle gains from use.
4,Decent Value,"Overall has a pretty good taste, but lower protein per serving than I thought I was getting at 25 grams. Always happy with BSN products but obviously there are lower priced alternatives. Overall I'd probably stick with Muscle Milk if I were satisfied with less protein just due to the amazing taste."
4,Great Protein Powder,For the price you can not bet this product. The chocolate flaver with milk is great.Would highly recommend this BAN Syntha-6 Protein to anyone who works out.
3,Good Value,"I have been resistance training for about five years and finally decided it was time to try a protein supplement. I didn't experience noticeable gains in strength other than an extra inch around my belt. My recovery time however was greatly enhanced though and the product tasted good. Overall, I believe this was a good value for the $22/a bottle. Would recommend however not strongly."
3,CHOCOLATE-PEANUT BUTTER TASTE,"THE TASTE OF CHOCOLATE PEANUT TASTE IS REALLY MORE CHOCOLATE AND JUST A HINT OFPEANUT BUTTER.I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TASTE BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO TASTETHE PEANUT BUTTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A GOOD CHOCOLATE TASTE TOO.THISPRODUCT MISSED THE MARK ON BOTH COUNTS TO ME.YOURS TRULY,TERRY TERRELL"
1,Kidney Stones,"**** BUYER BEWARE**** Having worked in this industry, I found a number of people (including myself) that passed kidney stones while using this product. More than one doctor agreed that the kidney stones could very well have been caused by this product. Have not had any issues since discontinuing it's use and using another protein source 2 years ago."
1,Taste..... Not so good.,"I ordered this product after reading all the great reviews for it. I drank some the first day I received it. Then, I didn't feel too hot the rest of the day or the next few days. I figured I caught a stomach bug or something. So I waited until I started feeling better and tried it again. This time - vomiting. My doctors ran a battery of tests since they did not believe the protein mix was causing it.Well, the tests didn't reveal anything. Not sure if this mix was old or what happened. It was definitely a waste of $30 bucks."
5,syntha6,"Great stuff. elder statesman, marathoner, mountain biker. This definitely gives you the reserves you need for long intervals of training."
5,awesome stuff,"really not a surprise bsn makes awesome stuff and this is no different .taste good , mixing is easy , it works!!!!"
3,not what I thought,"Its ok but Whey is a better product , I was told it a better then whey it not Sorry to say"
5,Awesome,Great product. Bought this for my husband. Vanilla is nice and thick. Lots of flavors to choose from. Def recommend
5,Great,"This is a great product, I use it for both post workout, and for the occasional meal replacement when I get busy. This also tastes great"
4,Super Tasty and Thick - Great Buy if on Sale,"The price is what attracted me to this - got it for about $25 bucks. The BSN Brand is top notch and usually VERY Overpriced. This shake is DELICIOUS. Mixes REALLY easily and taste like a strawberry Milkshake from McDonalds.Downside? You only get 22g of Protein in a 44G scoop, so only 1/2 of what you pay for is protein. Which means for 2.8 lbs product, only 1.4 lbs is protein. Compare to Isopure, where you get 23g of protein in a 30g scoop. The extra weight in the BSN should be comprised of scientific musclebuilding nutrients, but it may be just a bunch of sugar. (See ingredients, contains quite a bit of sweetner).I'll keep looking for ""MY brand"", but I am in no way dissapointed.-OC Jiu-Jitsu ManLake Forest, CA"
3,"Good Product, Couple Sidenotes.","Received it on time. I was looking for the best bang for the buck, and this product is surely it. Definitely the best price around if you get it through Amazon. The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor tastes great--it's the best tasting protein supplement with the best nutritional value compared to so many of the others you'd get from GNC, or any normal store. I also put some peanut butter in my shake with milk sometimes, that tastes AMAZING. All around very satisfied. As a sidenote, sometimes I get a stomach ache from it. It's also very sweet like most other supplements. I also asked my doctor about taking protein supplements in general and he was fine with limited use, but overall would not condone it. Bulk up the traditional way through your diet."
5,delicious,"this has to be the best protein powder i have ever tasted. very smooth and not too sweet. no artificial sweetners which is sometimes hard to find. great with organic or hormone free milk in morning or after workout. i plan on purchasing the chocolate next. warning the jar is huge so get a basic flavor to start with, so you can mix it up with other things. i use an immersion blender to mix it, easier to clean than a conventional blender and takes 5 seconds!"
5,Recommend to everyone,"I love all the BSN products I've tried so far. Its by far the best flavor and disolves the best with the other brands i've tried. This is great to blend up with some frozen fruit. It tastes just like a smoothie with no icky after tastes. I have let the girls in my office try my shakes and 4 of them how by the same brand, either vanilla or chocolate. I will say I have never just had it plain with water. I always blend it with vanilla soy/almond milk and some kind of frozen fruit. But again, compared to several other brands I've tried, this one is hands down the best."
4,GREAT TASTING,"Great tasting protein with alot of good stuff in too including casein. So its almost like a good meal replacement. This is a good protein for anyone trying to have a clean bulk up. I mean it wont just put calories and fat into you, you get a good amount of protein for the amount you buy. I did see a difference in strength and somewhat size. But the casein and the recovery from this protein is through the roof. I dont feel sore the next day of my workouts. For someone whos counting carbs, this may not suite your needs. But the flavor, its by far the best that i have tased so far. Also, buying this through Amazon, was really cheap even with the shipping. Only con was that this is pretty high in carbs and some fat since I take two scoops for my protein needs."
1,GNC Wheybolic Extreme 60 is better,"I started working out a year ago, starting with GNC Wheybolic Extreme 60. It's much lower cholesterol and fat than Syntha-6. I lost 5 lb of fat and gained back 9 lb of muscle in 6 months with Wheybolic Extreme. Healing time was always less than 24 hours. It tasted like a rich smooth milkshake.Then I switched to BSN Syntha-6 because it was almost half the price of Wheybolic and I was recommended it by a huge bodybuilder. The mochaccino flavor is pretty good, but is chaulkier than Wheybolic. It's not a perfect milkshake consistency. Recovery time was almost extended to 3 days - that's like as if I wasn't taking any protein at all. I also have not gained a single pound in the the past 3 months with Syntha-6. It just doesn't work.I also looked up Consumer Reports 2010 on protein powders. Syntha-6 contains many small, but legal, doses of poisonous metals. Wheybolic does not. I'm pretty sure I'm going back to Wheybolic."
3,Probably wouldn't purchase again,"I gave it a try and am not a big fan. I usually use GNC or ON proteins and typically don't have a problem with them but this one seemed to make me a little bloated. Tastes and mixes well, almost like a chocolate milkshake. A bit high in carbs and cholesterol for my liking as well."
5,review,Product came as advertised and at a good price. Arrived right on time. Always looking for a good deal on Syntha 6.
5,Great Protein Drink!,"To be honest, I was expecting this to not taste very good. In my experience, protein items have always tasted terrible, but I must say I was nicely surprise with the Chocolate Milkshake drink.Taste - 9/10. It legit tastes like a chocolate milkshake. I added a bit more milk than was suggested as it was a bit too chocolately with the recommended amount.Consistency - 9/10. Nice and think. Just like a milkshake should be."
4,Great All Around Protein Shake,"Syntha-6 is a great all around protein shake. Its sustained release formula garantees that your bod will fully absorb all the protein in the shake! Strawberry flavor is great, even with just water! I've started to see results with just 2 weeks of use!The only drawback is the amount of fat that it contains. At 200 calories per serving, it's a bit higher tha other protein shkaes wichic are around 120 -140 cal. So if you're gonna drink this, you'll have to work out a little harde to eliminate the exra fat this shake contains."
5,The best tasting protein available!,"This stuff is phenominal! It tastes better than any protein powder or meal replacement I have ever had. Hell; it tastes better than carnation instant breakfastvfor that matter! Add to that the amazing nutritional profile and the multiple sources of extremely bio-available protein and you have a , hands-down, winner for best protein ever."
5,Spread the word about Transport League!,"I first heard Transport League when I saw their video for ""Disconnect Massconnect"" (off the album Multiple Organ Harvest, also highly recommended but you'll have to get that from their label at www.seamiewrecords.nl) on Headbanger's Ball, and I've been hooked ever since. In fact, they've become my new favorite band!Satanic Panic is a great metal cd from start to finish. The riffs are exceptionally heavy and well written. The rhythm section is tight as can be and solid as a 20 lb sledge hammer! Then let us not forget the vocals, simply beautiful. Singer Tony J.'s voice is a mix of Danzig, Ian Ashbury (the Cult), and well, I can't exactly place who his scream sounds like at the moment, but it is without question quite powerful.Stand out tracks are: Hell Predicted, Neckdrop, Lord of 1000 Suns, and Psycho Connected"
5,"Had this book as a child, now for my child","I loved this book as a child. My scientist uncle had given us a microscope, so the ideas I learned from this book I was able to put into practice. Now my daughter is getting a microscope for her birthday, and I look forward to having the same fun with her that my mother and I had.As for the comment that it's for boys, I don't get it. I'm a woman, and I enjoyed this book as a girl. It certainly didn't warp me with any underlying social commentary. It's a book about a kid and his microscope..."
2,Self-absorbed designer angst,"There is actually a theory of fun buried in the book, but the time spent developing the theory is minimal. The rest of the book seems to be all about trying to justify choosing game design as a career. Geez! It's fun and you get paid. 'nuff said on that topic."
1,Warning,"WARNING: Scientology drivel. Read at your own peril. L. Ron Hubbard hated psychiatry and psychology because they were direct competitors to his new ""techniques."" Scientology is a scam. Please, do a thorough internet search before getting involved with anything that even remotely has anything to do with the cult of Scientology."
1,"Not for ""big"" dogs","I have a large lab mix and these pads are not even a quarter of the size I wanted. If you have a ""large"" dog, you are better of buying the largest pads made for bladder control."
3,I Feel A Bit Jipped,"Like others have said, these are literally small maxi pads. I have a 150 lb dog who is having issues wetting herself while she is taking steroid medication so I bought these pads to go inside the Washable Diapers I purchased, (made by Simple Solution, bought here on Amazon). The pads seem to absorb most of the leakage, but they are fairly narrow and don't hold much liquid. If they had ""wings"" or were thicker it would be better.I ended up buying human adult diaper liners at walmart (about 20 large liners for about 6 bucks) and they are working well.So, I would say just buy adult liners from your local store. It will end up saving you money."
1,Bad Dog Liners,"I bought these along with a dog diaper at PetCo. Ther store manager told me NOT to buythese, because all they were women's kotex. He was right. They are the cheapest type of kotex for a lot of money. I suggest doing what the store manager said, go buy kotex; they are better quality and a lot cheaper!!! Do Not Buy These!!!!"
1,What a joke!,I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers. These things are so small... I had to use two of them. Looking for alternatives now.
4,"Goodbye Shelley,Hello Kirstie","The 1987-88 season began with a new cast member,Kirstie Alley as Rebecca Howe,who is now managing Cheers and Sam Malone(Ted Danson),the original proprietor,is just a bartender(he'd later regain ownership of Cheers). Alley filled the place of Shelley Long,who departed the series at the end of the previous season. Alley had just wrapped up filming SHOOT TO KILL with Sidney Poitier and Tom Berenger. Amazingly,Cheers would stay on NBC for five more seasons after this one. Dr. Frasier Crane(Kelsey Grammer) was becoming serious with Lilith Sternin(Bebe Neuwirth). Again,NBC's Thursday night line-up of sitcoms was strong with viewership. Family Ties was moved to Sundays,though."
2,Cover Art Is Ugly,"What's with the white background? They can do better than that. Why couldn't they make the cover art the same as the other 5 seasons?That's why I only gave it 2 stars. The episodes surely don't disappoint. I've seen them before, but not on DVD. It'll be great."
1,It's better to go out on top.,Losing shelley long on cheers is like three's company without john ritter It's just such a wonderful thing to see her and to that change was very bad.
4,"Great for completists, but...","This set has more ""Oz"" content than any previously issued release, including the finished film itself. Unfortunately, the producers of the set decided to issue it in mono, while a previously issued single disc is in stereo. It's not WIDE stereo, mind you, but the sources with which they had to make a two channel mix adds just enough spaciousness to the sound to make it a great listening experience. They should have done the same with this set, which sounds flat in comparison with the earlier CD. Still, it's a must for ""Oz"" collectors. Get this while you can, since Warner Bros. (who controls the film) no longer owns WEA and the licenses for the soundtrack library have expired."
2,"Not brilliant - good research, badly put together","Julia Blackburn's biography of Billie Holiday is disappointing. She makes poor use of what appears to be excellent research by Linda Kuehl. Some of the interview material is fascinating, but it is poorly cobbled together.It's small wonder that this book gets intolerant and hateful reviews like that of Desiree Troy (though I suspect this particular reviewer is very young and inexperienced, given their extremely naive perspective). You get very little sense from reading this book of why Billie Holiday's music is still important to people nearly fifty years after her death, and seventy years after her prime.You cannot evaluate Billie Holiday just from reading this book, and in fact you probably shouldn't read it at all."
4,Sound Quality is Kinda Bad,"Being a huge fan of The Wizard of Oz, this cd is great. It's great to sing along to all of the great songs in this movie, especially being in a car. I think every Oz fan should own this cd if you truly love the music. But my only complaint is, the quality is not that good. Some songs are louder and clearer than others, some are kinda bad quality...kinda like someone just taped the songs while having the movie on. Other than that, it's good and Judy Garland is wonderful!"
5,You can always follow Dorothy down the Yellow Brick Road...,Travel with Dorothy from the time she appears to the Munchkins to the time she travels back to Kansas. After all there's no place like home!
4,The Memories of the Wizard of Oz!,"This CD brings back great memories for me. Just listening to it I can visualize the scenes from the movie. Plus it has one of Judy Garland most memorable songs, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow""."
4,"Useful, but made somewhat smaller than listed size","I've been using this with my Garmin 305 heart rate monitor for about a month. I am quite satisfied with this bra, and it does keep the chest strap in place which was a problem for me when using bras that didn't have the 'slots' cut in the lower band.The only negative, is that the bra does run somewhat small, as has been mentioned by others. So if in doubt, definitely order the next larger size."
5,the best,"yes, i wonder why everyone's claiming various other musicians to be innovative whilst the one who really is, is hard to get any info about! that is amazing...and very sad. personally i think that Mark Stewart is one of the most talented composers of our times and he plays/sings with his soul. he's got something that is similar to Van Gogh in painting, - he seems to be too emotional and looks like he feels too much and tries to express it all in his music. yet he's got the amazing rythm, drive and his stuff can pick ones attention fully cos not only is he ""an indie/underground/bohemian"" type of musician whos music is almost impossible to listen to cos of some so called ""experimental research"",- Mark Stewart's stuff is absolutely complete and he's got something real to say. It's catchy in a good sense and it's extremely far away from the mainstream.And yes, I wonder what he's up to now, in the year 2004...Wish to hear his new stuff so much, hope he's doing all great!"
4,Are you happy in your dream kitchen?,"Nobody review for Mark Stewart? That's a shame 'cause his stuff is BAD! This is hard, hard techno industrial produced by Adrian Sherwood of <<Tackhead>> fame. It's not all 200 bpm, however. Some of it is sooo slow and funky with Mark's subversive vocals coming through an electronic cloud.Stewart was (hopefully still is) an innovator. It's too bad Mark's earlier stuff isn't easily available. My favorite is Mark Stewart + Mafia. Mafia was Doug Wimbish, Keith LeBlanc and Skip McDonald aka the Sugarhill Gang at one time. Get this before it's out of print."
3,none,"Good little garlic cutter, only draw back to the cutter is the inner screen, which the garlic is press into. After you are done getting your uniform cut pieces of garlic, the screen becomes hard to clean, the press part after extended use becomes discolored and difficult to keep clean. Overall works great cutting garlic, but will need replaced about ever two years, if used on a daily bases."
4,Perfectly Minced,"Absolutely love this little product. I'm no chef, so it used to take me some time to mince garlic but no more with this useful gadget. Cleaning is not as difficult as one reviewer stated, it easily disassembles for cleaning, parts are small enough to soak in a bowl with warm soapy water, and if scrubbing is really needed, use a small toothbrush. I use it almost daily, minces 1 clove and mutiple cloves without a problem. I gave it only 4 stars because it does require some strength to twist and push but it's not that big a deal, you don't have to be Hercules. Other than that, it's a great tool to have in your kitchen."
1,Broken in the first week.,"The plastic housing broke in the first week. The entire unit, except for the housing, is made sturdy. The part that holds the two main pieces together is made of thin plastic."
4,kicking systems,"The systems work if you practice a lot (no ones stroke is exactly the same as someone elses) and learn to adjust for each table. The author means precisely what he says, you have to pay attention to every detail in the explanations. The outline of the 3 rail diamond system is as good as any."
3,"collection is great, but...","Why did they start putting ""real"" hair on these dolls? They frizz right out after a while, like a scary Barbie. The old original ones with the molded plastic hair were so much cuter--and tons easier to clean and keep nice looking. But overall the Loving Family collection is great and holds its play value for years."
3,Ok but has some design flaws.,"I recently purchased and returned the Timex T623 clock radio, because the display was unreadable at any distance. So I picked this one up in exchange, seeing that it had a nice green LED display. That may be true, but all the nice features that were on the other model are missing from this one. For example: Ability to sleep to ""nature sounds"" and wake to the radio. Can't do it on this one, pick one or the other and that will be both the sleep sound and the wake-up sound. Another example: Want to sleep to quiet background sounds and wake to something louder? Can't do it on this one, the volume you sleep to is the volume you wake to. Why can't they put this display on the other clock, then they'd have a winner. This one's going back too!"
2,hum hum,"on low volume you will hear a hum, somewhat complicated to find different features..........its going back sorry"
5,Valuable product,I have used Hearall for some time and needed a refill as my former supplier had stopped carrying it. Amazon supplied it at a very good price and fast delivery. This product has helped improve my hearing
2,Inferior Sandal,"I got these sandals on a ""good"" deal, but I was in for a bit of rough time with these.The break in period for these sandals was awfully long, and the band would pinch and pull at the top of my foot while I was breaking them in.The arch support on these sandals seems oddly shaped or positioned leaving me with foot pain if I have to walk in them for any distance greater than a few blocks.Finally, if you find yourself in any sort of rain or sudden downpour, as with any sandal, it gets a bit awkward to wear, but these things practially shoot off my feet if I even accidentally walk through a puddle.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this model of sandal."
4,"Comfortable, just don't wear them in the rain","Extremely comfortable sandals, these are my second pair of this model. My first pair lasted almost 2 seasons of heavy usage, pretty much everyday. They held up well until i pulled the one strap clean off while running in the sand. Got the front caught under some sand and that was the end of them. Tried some other brands and nothing could compare to how comfortable these are. Beware though, do not try to wear these in the rain, the sole material gets extremely slippery when wet. You'd be better off going barefoot at that point. Take care of these, don't wear in the rain, and they should last you a few years of comfortable summers."
1,Pretty bad all around,"As this an extremely low-budget movie, I can forgive the technical problems like awful sound, horrendous lighting, odd use of background music and choppy editing; but I cannot forgive the silly, predictable script, generally awful acting and the relentlessly dull direction. Mike Dolan, playing Alex--the new guy-- does some decent acting with the lines he's given to read, but some of the other actors--most notable the guy who plays Paul's roommate--are so bad and so unbelievable in their roles, it is hard to watch. The basic idea--homosexuality at a bible college--is an interesting idea to explore, but this movie is simply inept and just plain bad"
1,2wire pc port,This device was not compatible with new computer. It worked once then did not work again. New computer so it must be the adaptor
1,This Game is Horrible,"If you are looking for a cheep but okay DS racing game, stay away from this game. For anyone, buying this game is practically burning money. It's that bad. It is probably the easiest game I've bought."
4,Cool game,Got this game for 3 yr old and he does great ... sometimes goes in circle when racing but he loves it. He will grow into it.
4,Excellent base book,"This publication provides a broad range of basic and advanced techniques for the cold kitchen. We used this book in the culinary arts program at the college I attend and I have made many of the recipe's successfully. I withheld one star because I found that universally the recipe's lack proper seasoning. It's a great book for anyone needing real working recipe's and techniques for salads, dressings, hors d hovres, canapes, taurine, sausage making, smoking, and other detail cold kitchen work."
3,Great Music but Overpriced!,"""Billboard Top Rock 'n' Roll Hits: 1957-1961"" offers up some fantastic music from the golden age of rock & roll.The sound quality is great, as is the selection of hits.My problem is that there are only 10 songs per disk!Hey Billboard - this is the 21st Century - you're not selling vinyl anymore.This set could have been released on 2 CDs and the price set accordingly.So while I'd rate the music 5 ""Stars"", my overall rating is only a 3."
3,Very good bubble gum music from days gone by,"Quality is good,selection for this type of music is good.top fourty oldies of the time."
3,Pearlescent Blue Travel Mug Lid O-Ring Slippage,"The black rubber O-ring in the lid which keeps the mug from leaking has slipped out of place 3 times in the month I have had this mug. When it slips out of place (to a different spot on the lid), it prevents any liquid from pouring or leaking when the lid is ""open"" while allowing liquid to leak profusely when the lid is ""closed."" While relatively easy to reseat the O-ring, this slippage has always happened at most inconvenient times."
2,Damaged paper on arrival,"Box of paper arrived damaged and heavily taped up... inside, 3 reams of paper were damaged and taped up, apparently previously opened. Would not order again."
4,"It was not that bad, but it was missing something.","Firstly, as for the price lists for various troop types, it was incomplete and I was dissatisfied at the fact that they didn't include an appendix with excerpts from the discontinued 'Castle Guide'. Other than that I have no other gripes about the book as is; but if they were so kind they would compile and complete a reference encyclopedia for DMs and one for players too I wouldn't be able to complain. Oh yeah! if they can include psionics information in-depth, that would be cool too."
3,This book....So So.,"I've been playing D+D for an incredibly long time. And I have to say, if you were a DM, this is NOT the best refrence available. IMO, The Player's Handbook is better,The DM's manual is just an overblown edition of that. D+D's a great game, but this isn't exactly a great refrence. RPGing forever, but this is a little exagerated. My rating, 3 stars."
2,Not Very Good,"As someone who normally likes both Woody Allen and Bette Midler, this movie is a huge disappointment. The screenplay is trite, cliche, and only slightly funny; the setting is uninteresting; and the choice of music on the soundtrack is so ill-selected it becomes annoying. There is nothing creative or very funny about this movie at all--I don't even think I smiled (and this from someone who loves comedy and the two actors!). And the scenes with the mime were annoying and superfluous--even if you like mimes. Although both Midler and Allen give good performances, their on-screen chemistry together just never takes off, and their ""couple-hood"" is never very convincing. The truth is, their good acting just doesn't make up for the awful screenplay, and the fact that movie has no plot worth caring about. I must close by saying that this movie is, ufortunately, not worth seeing."
3,Makes The Viewer Feel Like A Mensch Schlep!,"I am not a Woody Allen fan. His neurotic persona never appealed to me. I watched this movie because I like Bette Midler. This film makes the viewer feel like a mensch schlep (third wheel, tag-a-long) who went to the mall with them, & has to suffer through their angst, make-ups, yelling matches, etc. because you need a ride home. In between the couple's dysfunction a lame mime is tossed in to try & add some comic relief. This movie could have been so much more."
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"Although it would have been a little better without the 2 men talking to each otherin the bar, I absolutely loved it! As Pedro Martinez said what's even bigger than winning the ring was BEATING the evil empire."
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge Red Sox fan and watched every pitch of those four days. I was very excited to get it. It is a professional product and with that comes high expectations. I was left very disappointed. I think the impression that I was left with was 'cheap'. It felt like the producers cut corners. Instead of watching the moments with commentary in the background, it seemed that we were watching two guys discuss the moments instead of 'reliving' them through the video."
3,Worth buying for William Warfield alone,"This soundtrack (and movie) is not in the same league as the classic 1936 film version of Show Boat, and neither of them measure up to the near-perfection of John McGlinn's 1988 audio-only Show Boat productionShow Boat (1988 Studio Cast), but it is still worth buying for one reason alone, and that is William Warfield's unforgettable renditions of ""Old Man River."" Paul Robeson was magnificent as Joe in the 1936 movie (and on stage), but Warfield's performance of the show's signature song is as good as it can possibly get."
1,A better choice is available,"I purchased this cart from another store doing so overthe internet. To return is too costly.I intended it to replace a 6 drawer rolling cart, where in a move,one wheel was broken off. I thought this cart was the same asthe broken one; it is not.The drawers on this model, do NOT come out far enough. Thus,whatever you have in the rear of the drawer becomes accessibleonly by moving the front items out of the way or removing completely.Also, these drawers are more difficult to completely remove if youdesire to do so to have easy access to contents if working awayfrom the cart. These drawers open out only about 8 1/2"" or so.A much better model, and the same as my broken one, is:NMC-360-Top Black (116106). It is found here on Amazon and thesame price as this model.With the NMC-360 model, the drawers open out much further and caneasily be removed from the cart.This model will now be placed in the garage."
4,12x12 paper will not fit - otherwise good product,I bought this primarily to get my 12x12 scrapbooking paper organized. I was bummed to find out that my 12x12 paper will not fit in this storage bin. I have since decided to use it to hold my tools and misc. scrapbooking items. It is very sturdy and I was happy that it came shipped already put together (except for the casters). It is a quality product - it just does not hold 12x12 paper.
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book. I am surprised because I don't usually like to read ""instructional manuals."" Mr. Murray has a very personal and friendly writing style, and I found myself drawn into the book as if it were an inviting novel. I highly recommend this book if you want to become a more efficient and effective writer."
4,"Elegant, pretty, lovely dish - slicer scuffed","The cheese plate and the handle of the slicer are very nice. The blade was scuffed (the best word I can come up with). This tray was purchased to go with the Winterberry dinnerware set. This is not fine china, rather it is very nice stoneware that is sturdy yet appears very elegant because of the delicate decor. All pieces came intact and there were no flaws in any of the pieces, with the exception of this one blade. Every piece purchased was on sale, making it easier to buy extra pieces."
4,"GI Joe, Rise of Cobra",This is a great action film with a good plot and average acting. Good mindless entertainment. I received the usual excellent service from Amazon.
2,Blah and bland even with the beefcake,"Well, I enjoyed most of the special effects - melting structures especially the Eiffel Tower (nanomites anyone?); secret bases under the Sahara Desert and the polar ice cap. But the special effects didn't make up for a mediocre plot, uninspired acting, no connection to the original G.I. Joe premise, absolutely NO feeling of patriotism.I used to watch the G.I. Joe cartoons in the 80s and 90s with my sons. They were more inspiring than this movie. And my brothers both had G.I. Joe figures when we were kids. In fact, my Barbies always married Joes, not Kens.A big problem - I think I will be watching this movie over and over - because I have already forgotten so many of the details that I will start watching it again and be a good way through it before I realize I've already seen this drivel over and over (G.I. Groundhog Day).The only reason I gave this a rating of 2 was because of the eye candy. I might be older but...."
2,Couldn't finish it ...,"We received this movie from Netflix by accident, so we decided to give it a try. Simply put, this movie is so weak that we had to bail out after half an hour, rather than wasting even more time by finishing it.There's plenty of action, the special effects are good, and there's eye-candy for the guys. But the plot is utterly juvenile and the acting is weak. The actor playing the lead character is particularly bad.If you're a 12-year-old boy and you like blowing things up, you might like this movie. Otherwise, be sure to skip it. I'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) only because of the special effects."
4,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"With the recent interest in creating movies based on toys and cartoons from the 80's, and the results that have been produced thus far, I did not have high hopes for this movie in the beggining. Fortunately this movie suprised me and turned out being really good. I remember G.I Joe from when I was young, and yes there are alot of discrepancies when compared to the cartoon, but the formula that the producers and writers used in this movie worked. Excellent story and nice twists. The acting was a little bland. Channing Tatum's performace here was very sub par. To me he just did not seem to be into it like the other characters were. Marlon Wayans' role suprised me. I'm used to seeing him in goofy humor roles, but he did very well in this film. Special effects were awesome too. Very impressive. This may be the best action movie I have seen this year. I was very pleased with this movie and can not wait for a sequel."
1,I Wanted to Like This Movie - I Really Did!,"But... the movie ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra"" could have been titled ""The Rise of Indigestion"". Watching it tended to give me said indigestion - poorly acted, a razor-thin story line, and insipid dialogue. I know, I know, just say what I really feel - don't hold back...I played with G.I. Joe's as a kid. They were cool, but limited in what they could do. The movie had the potential for bringing on the cool of ""Joe"" while stripping away the limits - and the trailer for the movie made it look like it was going to succeed in stripping those limits away and taking ""Joe"" to a new level of cool. Alas, it failed miserably...Snoopy's ""Joe Cool"" act is cooler than ""G.I. Joe's"" attempt at cool here.Bottom line? Don't waste your money on this DVD."
5,Great movie,Went to see this movie at the movies. Loved it. Hope i can soon get the whole cartoon series
4,Action x 1000,"What a great action movie - if u like it combined with some sci-fi / futuristic type weapons and the art of ninjitsu - Heman - action, martial arts and sci-fi fan - [...]"
3,Turn your brain off and enjoy,"OK you have to make a big decision before watching this movie. Do you really want something that will make you think and wonder if the world can be saved? Do you want to sit back and say it's impossible to build a huge city under the North Pole with no one watching, or that missile technology which eats everything? If you were want to be a scientist than this movie isn't for you.If you want to just enjoy a silly and fun action movie which celebrates being cheesy then this is more your speed. This is supposed to be fun and if you can relax and enjoy it you will be fine. Yes it has bad dialogue and enough plot holes to make Swiss Cheese look rock solid by comparison. But it works because the cast is obviously having fun and hamming it up. They're in on the joke and I would recommend people relax and get in on it too. Not a great movie, but what's wrong with just having some fun?"
2,Ughhh...,Why did Snake Eyes' face mask have lips? Just one of many atrocities commited by this film.
1,Movie Bad!,"This movie is close to one of the worst I have ever seen. The plot, special effects, and acting are all downright horrible. This should have been a release-to-DVD movie or ABC miniseries."
2,good but nothing like the idw comic book,"i was disappointed that the movie didn't even come close to the complexities found in the current IDW comic series. i'm not asking for academy award stuff but ... well, if you're not reading the current comics, you're missing out on the real joe mythos. and if you loved the movie, i think you'll love the book even more. especially the mini-series cobra."
3,C.G.I. Joe,"The title for the review says it all. The over-use of computer animated graphics made this flick somewhat cheesy. If you can stomach this problem, the movie itself is pretty cool & the characters are pretty good as well. The acting is only so-so, but it is what you would expect from a movie that is not loaded with A-listers. The plot was somewhat predictable just as it was in the animated series back in the 80's, so that is fine. The fake new technology/weapons in the movie was very cool & made for an interesting storyline. As long as the Baroness comes back for the sequel & is once again clad in pleather....I will be watching it."
3,"Not smart, but very entertaining","I grew up watching the cartoon and became excited when I heard a live-action movie would be made. I never did see in it theaters because of the horrid reviews this movie recieved after being very dissappointed with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, that was really bad. So when it came out on dvd I took my chance and decided to rent it.Let me tell you folks, this movie won't make you think hard or want to award the filmmakers any oscars or the like but man, this movie was really entertaining. It delivered with some really cool action sequences and the underwater batle was cool, kind of reminded me of the fighter battle in the Star Wars movies. It also delivered on some humor, courtesy of Marlon Wayans (who else?). I honestly can say I'd see the sequel and might even consider owning this film. It's not the greatest film achievement ever but man, it is solid entertainment and is an enjoyable 2 hours of not really having to think hard."
1,this movie is horrible...and knowing is half the battle,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Thankfully it was from netflix & not a purchase. Before buying, take the time to rent it... it will anger you, but only half as much as if you had spent your hard earned money on it."
1,Worst Movie I have ever seen,"Terrible movie on so many levels - where do I begin. And I am someone who was a hard-core GIJoe fan when I was a kid in the 80's:- Plot was tepid and predictable- GI Joe is the Real American Hero - this was the Real ""WORLDLY???"" hero? Seems like some overly PC nutjob wrote the script- Constant flashbacks was annoying and distractfulI could go on but long story short - Terrible movie."
2,JUST ENTERTAINING ENOUGH,"If you are looking for something with cool effects, some action scenes and a little eye candy here and there for a kick back evening, this will probably do. It's worth a rent just for kicks, but honestly, it was just entertaining enough to overcome some really horrible acting from Channing Tatum. His stilted lines, rushed delivery and lifeless performance is enough to be truly distracting. I like several of the other actors and frankly they along with the effects save this movie from abject failure. I made the mistake of a blind buy and have lived to regret it."
2,Not a good start...,"So I finally gained the courage to see this number, and realized it was yet another hokey take by Sommers. We are talking Van Helsing territory with this film. For some reason, the FX in Sommers' films have a made-for-tv cheese factor...along with script and acting. GI Joe, sadly, does not improve on things. Mis-castings galore with half the Joe team looking like Melrose Place drop-outs rather than seasoned warriors, along with the odd choice of Joseph Gordon-Levitte as Cobra commander.Plot? What plot? I wasn't looking for a deep movie. Just some decent entertainment, but even for that this film was a weak sauce. There are other options out there.All in all, not the best start to a franchise."
1,Death of a true american hero,"I guess if you are 5 or are easily moved by fancy special effects then you will love this movie. If you grew up watching and loved the GI JOE cartoon, then save yourself the frustration. Worst adaptation ever and the story is way off mark. I guess we should allow for some ingenuity and redefinition of story line as it moves to the big screen, but to me overall, it was empty. Full of bad acting, cheesy one liners and overly annoying special effects. A Transformer isn't even able to do all the crazy dumb stuff they do in this movie. I love special effects, but this movie is proof that it can be done too much and in bad taste. What was up with Snake Eyes leather lips? I can only hope they will not make another. I guess I'll have to settle for the original cartoon to watch the true American heroes.I say yo blow, cause this movie is a bust."
4,Great classic!,"Big classic movie, I love it! Thanks for all the action that make us remember since we were kids, just very funny."
4,Wonderful quality,This was a wonderful addition for the toy collection. My son and daughter both enjoy it and like to make the motorcycle click around the floor.
1,"Water is happy, Fire is really P.O.'d . . .","This book is self-described as a ""blend of science and spirituality""... wouldn't that be fantasy or science fiction?If the book agrees with your faith, please don't let yourself near any elementary-level science offerings here on Amazon - those books have some ""sciency"", plain-fact energy going on that will ruin your day."
1,The Secret Life of Water - silly.,"Farfetched, but boils (water, lol) down to rather to look at the world with a glass half full (of water, lol) attitude."
5,Great entertaining story!,"I've just finished the book and I have to agree with all positive reviews. It is a perfectly ballanced mix of noir, mystery, horror and humor. I'm looking forward to the other books of the trilogy."
4,Very different,"I almost put this book down a few times, because it was so very different from other books I read. It's a detective story set in a very odd future. But every time I picked it up again, I once again became more and more interested in the story. The main character(s) has quite a bit of mystery to him besides the mystery of the story itself. The descriptions of the times he is living in are very vivid. I would give it a 5 star except for all the times I almost didn't continue reading it. If you find yourself doing the same thing, continue on, it's well worth it."
2,Couldn't get into it,I just couldn't get into this book. The end of the world aspect got lost in the crazy layout of the characters. I wanted end of world and got detective story with painful to follow plot instead.
2,This album is the worst of MBM,"But still it is worth a listen. The lyrics are so stupid, I couldn't bear it. Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto is the most talented musician I know of. Each album is completely different and pleasant, except for this one. Jack is obviously a sample hog, collecting interesting voice samples from the strangest places and then using them wisely. He sings well, and lives up the group's name with good, meaty rhythms. I own the entire collection of MBM albums and enjoy them often."
2,Probably MBM's worst album,"I bought this CD like four or five years ago and it has never sat quite right with me. MBM is capable of making excellent music, but I agree with George (below) - this is probably Jack Danger et al.'s worst album. The lyrics on the album are awful and the soundscapes/beats can be unlistenable at times (""Psyche-Out"" probably beating any other song on the album for being obnoxious). Some tracks are good like ""Now"", ""Hello Teenage America"" and ""Helter Skelter"". Jack's only previous album ""Storm the Studio"" is far better than this, and being a huge fan of MBM (I own all their albums with the exception of their newest, RUOK?) I must say that anyone who is just recently becoming a fan of MBM should not buy this album. I would recommed Satyricon or Storm the Studio if you want to hear their old stuff - this album should only be purchased for the sake of completing a collection."
3,"An Interesting Enough, if not slightly disappointing, CD","I was very excited to hear that Korn was coming out with a new CD, especially because Jonathon Davis said it was heavier like their earlier stuff. I was also worried because it was little over a year after their third release, and I thought they might be trying to rush their new cd. I bought it, and i must admit,I was slightly dissapointed. While it is edgier than Follow the Leader, the new beats they experimented with didn't work to well for them. The best song in my opinion is the first track, ""Dead"". However, I' m sure they'll bounce back with their next cd, which is probably going to be due out this summer."
4,Diffreent-For Better or Worse?,"I'm a fairly new Korn fan, ever since Follow the Leader came out. I really enjoyed its hard edge feel and the rap influences added a bit of diversity that was a refreshing departure from other hard rock albums. Issues is a bit different. It traded in the rap influences for some actually more melodic content that is very appropriate for the feel of the album. The dark and depressing atmosphere is also accentuated by Davis actually hauntingly singing parts of the songs-not just screaming. I think for the truly hard rock fans out there this album might be a bit too different, but for those who like to hear changes and growth in a great band's sound will be pleasantly surprised by the melodic adaptations. They complement the raging beats and guitar sounds very well and create a very different but undeniably successful CD."
4,I like it...,"I like it...but I think that the songs are a little to repetative. If you listen to the cd the whole way through, then it will get boring but if you just listen to some key songs, like Trash, Hey Daddy, and Let's Get This Party Started, then I think you will like it alot more."
3,uh? I don't know what to think,"At lest they're not raping anymore. This cd has some high points. Like ""falling away from me"" and ""beg for me"" But it's not as good as the old stuff. I know that they are trying new ways of music but me being an ""old school"" korn fan I don't really like it. Korn (in my mind) has died slowly every time they put out a new album. ""Fallow the leader"" was a sign that they were losing their thouch. The music is good at best. It's just not them anymore."
3,A Disappointing CD,"What can I say other than I never want to listen to it anymore because it is so depressing. This CD is way to slow for comfort. There are some good ol' KoRn songs however. They are: Falling Away From Me, Trash, and Make Me Bad."
3,korn takes a turn for the worst,What is this that my ears were hearing surely this isnt korn like from the first album.is so commershal and as the first song tells you dead unlucky korn u have failed.
2,stick with follow the leader,ok first off i dont really like this cd. i mean i like korn and everything but i was really dissapointed with issues. i guess im just used to their hard hitting sound. they should of stuck with it and not change their sound.
5,The new Korn cd is great!,"This cd is awesome. This is one of the best cds ever from any rock bands. The best songs are Falling Away From Me, Trash, Beg For Me, and 4U. I recommend buying this cd even if you never liked Korn to begin with. I never liked Korn until I heard this cd!"
3,not as much talent,this new album is ok. it seems to be a lot darker than the last two albums but there isnt as much guitar action as there should be. its pretty good though. buy it if you just want to hear new korn
3,Once again Korn re-invents their sound.,"As the above title says, Korn has once again managed to come up with a new sound on this album. I give it 3 stars because I am not yet sure of how I feel about it. The more I listen to it the more the songs grow on me. Issues is much darker with a deeper meaning that Leader was in my opinion. The band still seams to be growing artisticly and you can hear that on a few of their tracks. Issues is not what I expected with all the hype surrounding it. But I still like it. My favorite songs are probably ""Falling Away From Me"", ""Beg for Me"", ""No Way"", and even ""Trash"". Some of the ""MTV"" fans are most likely not going to like this album because each track is unique and not all like ""Falling"". Don't think that this is a wussified album though. It is still Korn and there are still funky beats and kick ass guitar riffs that are bound to get the blood flowing. That's my opinion, take it for what it is. Later."
1,Beautiful harmonies....NOT!,"This band/album stinks. Korn and their manipulation of our culture and media, with their vile message and underacheiving drivel, has corrupted rock music as we know it. Music isn't music if it doesn't have a positive and thought-provoking message. That is why Korn stinks. If you want to hear mellotron the way it was meant to be played, listen to Pink Floyd, early Genesis, and other real bands. Don't waste your time listening to this. Thank God I didn't actually pay to listen to this immoral garbage."
4,no more pop rock for korn,"i love this cd. it may not be the same as their older stuff, but if artists don't change..how do they get better? This album is great and wonderfully dark."
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I can't believe that I'm wasting my time on this review. I thought their last album sold them out, this is rediculous! When are they going to start doing Pepsi and Taco Bell commercials! This album is just horrible, coming from a Korn fan since their debut album! If you're a REAL Korn fan are a NEW one, please, please, please just buy the first two albums. Their last two albums are targeted for those MTV kids out their that don't know a damn thing! If I could, I would rate it 1/4 of a star!"
1,Sellouts,March 21 is gonna be the end of all this trendy korn krap cause PANTERA is commin and its not gonna be pretty.
2,I almost hate this album.,"I've been a big KoRn fan since the beginning. Their first album blows away all of their other albums. I'd put FTL second, followed by LIP. Issues is definitely the worst of the four, in my opinion. I just do not like this album and I'm so disappointed. There are only a couple good songs.. most of the others I just dislike entirely or I only like certain parts of them. Their next album better be better than this..."
4,"Korn, not KORNY","I've never thought of myself as a ""Korn"" fan. I do not like much of this groups first two releases, and unlike most Korn fans I like the latest two albums better. Issues was particularly a shock. Freak On a Leash I have listened to many times, and I mildly enjoy it. But this new disc ""Issues"" is a true testament to Korns towering shadow of orginality, and force. They are not in the packs of bands who claim to be ""Rap Metal"" or ""Nu-Metal"", no Korn leads the pack, and with this release nobody will challenge that. Although Korn will never win the most melodic award, they have achived new melodic heights on many of the songs, and they of course still know how to rock. Give them a chance, don't let trend loving 13 year olds who only listen to them because they love LIMP BIZKIT (please) scare you away from this true band, appreciate them for musical mastery, instead of the bands ""trendy"" coolness. Dan."
5,KORN IS THE BEST BAND!,"if your a korn fan, you have got to get this cd! every song is great, but the best is ""falling away from me"". ""make me bad"" is also awesome. the only thing i didn't really like was the little interlude things, but the rest was incredible! you gotta get this cd!"
3,A Simple Review,"Ok Lets Get This Out of the way first.. Yes I am a Old-skool KoRn fan.. I Have Know the Band for about 5 years but this has no effect on my review. I have also had a longer time to review this cd than most people, I have had it for around 2 months. So let's get started here. #1: This CD was said to be more like the first CD. It isn't. So, if you loved that CD you most likely won't love this one at all. #2: If U Like Follow the Leader and like just Freak On A Leash & Got The Life You Also won't like this CD much. It VERY dark and depressing. It isn't the best CD in the world and the other KoRn CDs are better in my eyes but in with what is comming out lately you can't go wrong."
1,What is this?,This is the worst Korn album. It is not worth your money to listen to this corporate garbage.
1,WHAT IS THIS!!!???!!!,"I have never really been a big fan of KoRn. Everyone I know always talks about KoRn this and KoRn that. Korn is very unoriginal. they're musical style(singing to bass and drums with no guitar), despite how original people will tell you it is, is nothing more than ripping off of Judas Priest(think Sad Wings of Destiny). The one thing that sets Korn apart from Judas Priest is that they cannot play, sing, or write music. It seems that Korn's lead singer always talks about how his life sucks and he wants to commit suicide. Well, GET OVER IT!!!! This album just finds Korn continuing to make subpar music with whiny lyrics about the same thing. To all you people that went out and bought this album, WHY!!??. And, to all of you who have not bought it but want to: save your money. this album ,and this band in general, is horrible. What has happened to my beloved heavy metal??"
2,"Worse than ""Life Is Peachy""","KoRn's new album ""Issues"" is a big dissappiontment compared to their earlier cd ""Follow the Leader"". It isn't nearly as hard as their other releases and most of their songs on ""Issues"" are lame and boring. The only good songs are ""Make Me Bad"", ""Trash"", and ""Falling Away From Me"". So even if you are a true, die-hard KoRn fan, don't go out and buy this piece of ""Trash""."
4,Not Bad,"My first listen to this band was at my friends who used to play Korn repeatedly all day, which in the end made me hate them. I eventually borrowed the cd off him and within an hour of listening to selected tracks i could understand what he had been trying to tell me for ages. My favourite track on the album is Make Me Bad(Excellent video), Falling Away From Me, 4U and Dirty. I'm sure if this is their best album to date as its the only one that i have really listened to. but from this taster im going to say that it gets my vote"
2,To Hyped up,"I think that all the hype surrounding this album built it up. If it hadn't been hyped I would have given it a solid four stars but alas it couldn't live upto the hype. It's sad actutally. I'm a hardcore Korn fan and that's why it got 2 stars. There are only 4-5 good songs. ""Falling Away From Me"",""4 U"", ""Make Me Bad"", ""Somebody Someone"" and ""Let's Get this Party Started"". Don't spend your money. Just download those four songs. only buy this if you're EXTREMELY obsessed w/korn if not use it to buy ""Follow The Leader"" arguably their best album."
3,not from the old school.....,"The first two korn albums blew me away, the third was decent enough to be listened to but im torn with issues.... The music is heavy enough to contend with other albums, but the vocals are horrible. They sound way too whiney.....yes, yes yes....i understand what jon's singin about but he doesnt have to sound like a 5 year old who dropped his ice cream.....if this is your first korn album, then you will be lead astray by what true korn sounds like."
3,Paaaaty with the Korn-meal,"No Way especially, is a very disturbing song. I was surprised that each and every one of these songs did not make it onto mainstream radio immediately. It is heavy, with fuzzy bass and plenty of rage-filled lyrics and growls that teenagers are sure to relate too. Party music? I say not. Party Heartty Music? O-tay!"
3,I DONT KNOW,"I am not quite sure about my responses to this cd. I have listened to it all day and i hear some stuff that i like but in my opinion i think they rushed this cd out in time for the millenium. I may be wrong because this may be one of those cds that you have to listen to a few times before it grown on you. The cd is alright i like ""No way"" but Follow the Leader is much better. PS> I buy lots of cds and know alot about music i love all the heavy bands KORN, Rage, Metallica, Deftones, Zombie, etc. If you want one cd for the rest of your life buy MACHINE HEAD (THE BURNING RED) it is the best cd i have ever heard every single song is great i own about 120cd and not one of them compares to this one except maybe Master of Puppets. Thanks ."
1,I prefer corn to Korn,"Take the lamest Nine Inch Nails album and splice it with the best Linkin Park album,(or I guess any Linkin Park album will do since they all sound the same) and what do you have? Korn. Enough of these substanceless, mainstream, sell-out high school rock bands like Korn, Linkin Biscuit and Hootie Blew my Fish already! Bands like Razed in Black, Psychopomps, and Biopsy all make Korn look like N'Sync singing a Shania Twain song."
3,"OK, but it could have been much better","OK, I was leary to accept them from the start (first album) but I did. I really liked their first and second album and a few songs off the third one. But come on, this album is lacking. Only two good songs and the rest is trash. I do like Korn but their latest album was obviously put out too soon, consequently, much wasted songs that could have been better if only the time was spent. I won't say they sold out, but a lack of real devotion and time is definately a factor."
2,I love it!,I just started listening to Korn over the summer and i loved them. My friend told me which albums were the best and I first bought Follow the Leader. I soon bought their debut album Korn and then Life is Peachy. I ordered Issues before it came out so i would be one of the first people to get it. When i heard the cd i loved it! it wasn't as good as Follow the Leader but it is a definite if you are a Korn fan.
5,Smashing,The Best KoRn album ever if you don't have it yet go buy it now. I repeat go buy it now. Totally awesome. Much Harder than the first album.
3,...Hmmm...,"...Issues strays from the path paved by the first three albums by Korn. First of all, they start out the album with a pretty descent song with a bagpipe, which is pretty tight. However the album overall lacks the energy that dominated the first ones. It seemed that they just wanted to get another record knowing everyone will buy it and say it is good just because it is 'korn.' the album lacks effort as a whole, best part is probably the cover art and the photographs inside..."
5,Just one reason why korn rocks...,"Pretty damn cool album, I particularly like Trash, Falling Away From Me, Wake Up, and Lets Get This Party Started....This is a pretty good album if you give it a chance, you actually can listen to it from start to end while you are driving or what ever (you can't do that for 95%+ of the albums out there!)"
1,"Whaaaaaaa!!!!! My Dad Molested Me, whaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!",The intro to Make Me Bad is pretty cool. That's the best I can do.
2,Korn- Issues,I don't need to say much about this album. I threw Issues from Korn away because of the deathly ridiculous lyrics. Nobody deserves to be hurt. Don't waste your time and get this album. Suicide prevention.
5,korn,"we'll i tried to listen to korn ""falling away from me"" and i can't get to it. but i don't know why. but i still love there album. and i know the song in my head. but i really don't have the password trying to listen to it and i can't get to it. so do something to make me listen to korn because i love that song. and i really want to listen to it"
1,this band is worthless,what in the hell is this? this trash is horrible. i hate korn so much. all that jon davis does is whine like a baby in his songs. the band is so terrible at there songs. this band is nothing but noise that is annoying. people today love this garbage and i don't understand that. korn has no talent at all.
5,best of korn,"basically an evolved version of follow. Each of the tracks are a little better, plus there are more then on follow the leader."
3,i own this cd,i also have life is peachy and follow the leader. i got issues because it was on sale. the cd is ok but not as good as the other two korn cd's i have. the best song on this cd is beg for me. well buy this cd if you want to be amazed
5,Best thing since their first CD!,"This CD has extremely wonderful songs! But there are two cons. First, the music isn't as aggresive as the previuos albums. Second, Jon doesn't include any of his grunting/gibberish in any of the songs. But there are some pretty twisted songs on this album. My favorite song on this album is Let's Get This Party Started! without a doubt. Trash comes in a close second and Wake Up in third. You won't regret buying this."
5,Great album,"This is a good album, with great songs and shows that korn is tryin to show their serious side."
2,I'm A Born Again Christian,"I'm born again similar to Catholic, and you stand warned that witchcraft is still a crime."
4,Small but effective,"This is a decent product for tidying your workspace. I bought one to keep my stationary and gift drawings created by small children. The top two drawers are too small for cds and the like but a good size for pens. The drawers can be a little annoying to remove from the chest but this sturdiness is also a virtue, it's not going to fall apart on you. It's not the prettiest thing in the world but it gets the job done."
5,Great book,Awesome!Arrived promptly and in great shape. I am very pleased with the book I recieved. Can't wait to start classes and use the book.
5,Son gives it 5 stars... I'd give it 2.,"My son would watch this on repeat, 24/7 if he could. It's a short video, but he loooooves it. Definitely recommend for toddlers."
4,Good book. Has mistakes though.,"This book covers a lot of ground, but has several mistakes in it. I found them to be very confusing and annoying. I would have given it 3.5 stars if I had the option."
1,Impossible to watch!,"FoxLorber should be adviced to immediately withdraw their DVD-version of ""The Millionaires"" from circulation! Softer than soft and paler than pale, but worst of all: a pan and scan copy of a CinemaScope film! Abominations like this should no longer be allowed on DVD! Either it's the correct aspect ratio, or nothing! For years, I've been waiting to see this flawed but entertaining film again, but after five minutes the disc was taken out and returned to the shop where I bought it. And they were fully understanding. FoxLorber have issued some great, eagerly awaited stuff on DVD, and I thank them for that, but please make sure that we soon can look forward to a version of this film mastered from a decent looking print - AND in CinemaScope!"
4,More adventures of the Bradys and Alice,"Season 1 was released on March 1,Season 2 was released on July 26 and Season 3 was released six days ago. And Season 4 is on its way. Like I said in the review for the Season 2 set,Brady Bunch fans will own a copy of the entire series before too long. The only difference between this season and the previous two are the Brady kids growing taller. This is immediately noticeable with Greg(Barry Williams). He must have grown about six inches in height since the series premiered in 1969. Williams was 15 years old then. Carol's(Florence Henderson) youngest daughter Cindy(Susan Olsen)is starting to outgrow her cuteness. Even oldest daughter Marcia(Maureen McCormick)is maturing into a beautiful young woman. Here are the episodes that aired between fall 1971 and spring 1972. The Brady Bunch was in the Nielsen Top 10 with All In The Family,The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Partridge Family."
5,a must have,"These are the best lesbian short films I have seen. ""Interview with my Next Girlfriend"" is hilarious and I would get this DVD just for that one. The namesake of the collection, ""Watching You"", is in a different language, so you have to read subtitles which is only a small distraction. The short titled ""10 rules"" or something like that is very funny, though I think they could have come up with some more creative ""rules"" (in the spirit of the ""ironic but true"" thing they were going for)."
4,Intelligent and fun short films,"Ironically, Watching You is the least watchable of these films, but the others are definitely worth viewing. They are witty, sexy, funny and at times downright hilarious. This is one of the few lesbian-themed DVDs that was worth my time and money."
2,Dogs not crazy,"My three dogs were not at all interested in the bubbles, I thought they were fun, but no interest from my dogs."
2,I WONDER WHATS IN IT?,"This stuff makes lots of bubbles. The biggest I was able to blow was about 1-1/2"" dia. My dog does have fun chasing them but what concerns me is the fact that the bubbles dry to a plastic like materal. This stuff sticks like supper glue to your clothes, furniture, the dogs fur, and one of the bubbles landed on one of my dogs eyes and he went nuts trying to get it off."
4,Great Product,"I'm in the military, specifically the Army Infantry Corps, so obviously I'm going to use this product a lot, and I really have. I've had it for about 3 weeks and am really impressed. This is a great product. You can just feel the quality of the craftsmanship in it. However, I haven't had any communication with their customer service since I never needed to. The only reason that I'm giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 is because it doesn't include an obvious tool and that is a small pair of scissors. Yes it's not a big deal, but you'd be surprised how much you use those tiny scissors. Not for arts and crafts or gift-wrapping, but for various uses out in the field."
5,Massachusetts Wildlife,"This is one of the best nature magazines around, highly respected by naturalists, biologists and sportsmen. It has been fifty years at the forefront of superb wildlife reporting, offering exceptional photography, excellent writing and uniform quality of editing. From Cape Cod to the Berkshires, a must for anyone interested in Massachusetts outdoors with tips on wildlife viewing, hunting and fishing. You can also follow biologists in the field. This magazine has a vast variety of information, for instance a recent article on the ecology and conservation of tiger beetles was seminal in its subject, as was one on edible foods and analyzing mammal bones.Great for professionals, laymen, and teachers alike!"
2,CHECK REV LEVEL,"THIS PARTICULAR OFFERING IS DATED: Publisher: Sams (August 14, 2004)CHECK FOR LATER EDITION!! CONTENT IS GREAT BUT DATED. CD-ROM IS VER. 1.1.2. VERY OLD."
3,Just okay,My son loves Elmo in Grouchland so I thought that this would be a great second option for him but it just isn't as good as Grouchland. Grouchland has a continuous story to it and this has mini stories (like Elmo loves you). This is more like Sesame Street instead of a movie. My son likes the Sesame Street characters so he will pay attention to it but it is just okay.
5,Grandma,"Tina Fey is great - and Elmo is always good. The grandkids, 19 month old twins, love it. Jim Henson's goal with Sesame Street was to keep the parents interested and amused so they would watch with their children. Jim may be gone, but that essence still remains!"
4,Wheel Chair Back Pack,Great size. I can put my purse in the chair back pack and not worry about it as I manuver mom's wheelchair. Still room for other things she might need on an outing.
5,Very good,I got that for my moms wheelchair we use for her when she spends the summer with us. Funny thing is when she went home I had foot surgery and had to use her chair at work. The back pack comes in so handy to put paperwork in while I am going from my office to other areas
2,Poor Quality,The picture makes it look much nicer than it is. It's the cheapest feeling material ever and I don't trust putting many items in it for fear it will rip. I think the use of the words back pack are misleading. Nice concept but use of better material would have made this a much better product. Save your money.
5,does the Job,"This product does the job well. Didn't know if it will be good for all sizes cups but iy is good and it was delivered very fast, got it a day after ordering which is considered very fast!"
4,Functional,This cup dispenser is sturdy and easy to install. I would recommend it for any one who has a use for it.
4,Good product but does not thread easily to Cannon camera,"I have just received this polarizer and it seems well made. However, it does not thread well into my Cannon UV filter and I fear that it will fall off when I circulate the lense. The front disk for circulating the lense is so small that it is somewhat diffiult to turn with my large fingers. I assume it will be easier to circulate once I have turned it several times. ACB"
5,Circular Polarizer,"This item was much needed for my setup and now, really makes a difference as I shoot on the water and often have the sky as a background. It's a sturdy and surprisingly heavy piece of glass which in my book, is a good sign."
2,This is dated,"This book is very dated. The instructions are okay if that's all you want, but style-wise this book is old, old, old."
4,Must-have for the Anglophile...,"...who's sometimes a bit vague on his history.It goes without saying that this isn't an exhaustive reference, but it succeeds at what it is--a handy, very quick reference to English and Scottish monarchs. If you're wondering who was on the throne when Dickens began writing, if you need a quick reminder of who was the first Plantagenet ruler, if you know the Black Prince was Richard II's father but can't for the life of you remember his mother's name, this book will let you find your answer in just a couple of minutes. Worth the purchase price."
5,An excellent short reference book on the British monarchy.,"Fry's much-condensed version of his earlier book is an excellent, handy and short guide to the British monarchy. Its graphics, photographs and charts are high quality and the text provides the useful highlights of the periods."
3,CONCISE,"This little booklet provides us with a readable and concise history of the Kings and Queens. It traces the successions and the ""benchmark"" events of the reigns of these royal persons succinctly so the reader can grasp quickly a well-tangled historical record. Like any ""concise"" review, of course, there is precious little ""meat-on-the-bone"" beyond a genealogical trace through the hundreds of years of British history. It serves fairly well, however, to trace the ""institution"" of the British monarchy while giving us numerous teasers for further reading."
5,"All B + W filters are great, including this deep yellow","Yes, even the non-MRC filters are coated, but single coating. Gives proper contrast on black and white film, using medium format camera. The yellow #9 is just right IMHO for having just a single yellow filter, cuts out excess blue and removes some haze without being too harsh, if that's what you need. Recommend that you check out the filter factor on B + W's website and adjust your ISO speed downward accordingly.Strength's are light transmittance values for schott glass and coating, and true filter factor and tint performance. Brass frame always great, won't cross thread or bind like cheap aluminum frames on others. Great price for this filter size, and likely the only yellow you need in a black & white contrast filter. Used in fall with Aspen Trees, Turns Aspens whiter on the film, and skies darker."
2,What was this about?,"Was the point of this to tell George Steinbrenner's history with the Yankees? Or was it to tell the story of the new stadium? Of Steinbrenner's ever-morphing relationship with the fans? Of the Steinbrenner family's takeover of the Yankees as George declined? It had elements of all of those, yet did not complete a story arc on any of them.As someone who admires and respects the great history of the Yankees and has enjoyed learning about that in various baseball books and in great documentaries such as Ken Burns' Baseball, this left me wanting more."
1,This Book Attacks The Church,"After reading the book and then having this book used against our church in a court case by backslidden former members, I see real danger in this book. By it's negative nature, it gave a certain ""mantle"" and ungodly mission to a group of people who left our church, and after they did, began to drink, swear, lie, and attack the very fiber of our church all because they had some kind of mantra from this heritical book. Having no authority in the church as leaders or pastors, they took on the self appointed goal of rebuking us with pages of the book, and wouldn't even stand up for what they ""believed"" on the witness stand. After the judge charged and fined them, he gave a fitting lecture on real Christianity and how to deal with problems between people, a skill which those who used this book as their defense seriously lacked! If you have it, throw it away! Buy Unmasking The Jezebel Spirit, instead!"
2,Don't bother,"In my opinion, this game was somewhat disappointing. I would much rather hook up the NES and play a game with substance like Baseball Stars. Sadly that franchise never carried over to Super Nintendo and gamers were forced to compromise with cheap knock offs like this."
4,LaGuitara,Anyone who's interested in the guitar as an instrument in it's most artistic form will love this album.
5,"Great product, great price!","Great product, great price. I have 3 boat trailers. One has had this model ""Bearing Buddy"" for years. The other 2 have had 2 different brands. The other 2 brands did not work as well and were more difficult to use. They required regreasing more often and were more difficult to see how full they were. I finally purchased genuine ""Bearing Buddies"" for the other 2 trailers, so now all 3 have the best bearing protectors I have ever seen or used. I strongly recommend this product, and the price is the best I have seen, especially for the stainless steel model."
5,A great idea! How fun!,"This books solves all those little gift-giving problems that come up in a relationship. What do you get a guy who has everything? What is he thinking? What does he like? What does he want? This book makes it simple, and fun, to get to know the man in your life, and to shop for him, too!"
2,Some Things are Meant to be Broken,"Amazon did a great job with getting this item shipped out to me immediately. I was eagerly awaiting the package.Unfortunately, when I received this item it was damaged. The handle to the broom was bent and all it would take for it to completely break would be a bend to the broom handle the other way and at that point it would be too dangerous for my 14 month old girl to play with. I don't recommend this product because the broom handle is not made to be sturdy.I contacted Amazon right away and I got a refund right away. They were so good with all of my concerns and their customer service team is amazing!! Amazon is definitely a pleasure to do business with!"
4,Broom set,Overall good quality. The larger broom does come apart so supervision is important or the pole part can become a weapon. :)
5,Great for my two girls to help sweep up,"This is the best toy broom for the money. My two girls love to ""help"" clean up after they spill something. This little broom empowers them to be able to go and get a broom and dust pan and be self sufficient. My 4yr old loves being able to do things herself. She beams with pride when she is done. My 19 month old loves to copy both of us. We have great fun ""cleaning up our messes"" all together--and both girls get something to use."
1,Arrived bent! Shipping box was undamaged!,"The broom handle is made of very cheap plastic. The handle arrived bent...looks like someone tried to bend it in half. The weird thing is that the box was undamaged! I'm not sure how it would have gotten bent during shipping. It makes me wonder if they sent it that way...which doesn't make sense, but I can't think of any other explanation. I will be looking for a better quality toy broom for my daughter. I can't imagine that it would last very long even if it did arrive unbroken."
3,Loved but not for long,"I bought these two ""sweeps"" as my twin nephews call them for their 2nd birthday. The love sweeping so I was very excited to get these for them. The size of these brooms are perfect for young kids and they are very bright and colorful. Unfortunately the sweeps only survived about 2 months tops with the boys before they snapped in two. I'm not saying that these things are poorly made because my nephews are extremely hard on things. If you have kids that are not as prone to breaking things then these are fantastic. If you do have kids like my nephews then don't be surprised if they only get to enjoy them for a little bit."
3,Great Idea,"This would have been great if it hadn't arrived with a bent handle. I didn't send it back right away and my kids kept going with the bending until the handle snapped in half. Also, my fairy-tale idea of kids instinctually knowing how to sweep once they're given the right-sized broom was proved to be totally false. That being said though, if I had sent it back and had taken the time to teach them to sweep, I really think it would have been good. As it is, I think I'll wait till my kids are older and see if we can't just screw in some other handle to the broom head. The hand broom and dust pan are great and my five-year-old can actually clean up messes with it, so, it was actually worth it just for that! I'm still going to try to fix the broom though...."
4,Just what I was looking for!,The set is great and serves it's purpose! My daughter loves helping so this is a perfect toy for her. The handle of the broom is not super durable but it will last us a while. Very happy with our purchase.
3,Cute,Purchased this set for my 18 month old daughter because she was always trying to use the regular broom...and she loves to have her own broom to help momma sweep. She even put the pan down to sweep the dirt up.My only complaint would be that the dust pan doesn't attach to the big broom.Overall happy with purchase.
1,"Cheapo product, Bad packaging.","I was so disappointed all the way around. It came UPS,and glad I opened it first, as it was very bent. Broom looked like someone stepped on it, very very flimsy handle.Schylling Little Helper Broom Set"
2,A very cut-rate quality compilation indeed,"This entire CD is rechanneled stereo (bad news for audiophiles), but these 12 songs are among his signature songs and is an OK overview for those who don't want a multi-disc overview although a much better single disc overview of his hits is ""Bing's Gold Records"" which remains in print and available right here at Amazon.com. This compilation was originally released as an LP on MCA in 1977 and some of the songs, aside from ""White Christmas"" that are on it include ""Pistol Packin' Mama"" (with the Andrews Sisters), ""Don't Fence Me In,"" (with the Andrews Sisters), his versions of ""I Surrender, Dear"" and ""Blue Skies,"" ""Deep In The Heart of Texas,"" ""Swinging on a Star,"" ""Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,"" (with the Andrews Sisters) and others but all of the songs on the disc are great. The best thing about the disc is indeed the price. The song selection could have been better though."
3,Warm but wierd,"I have only 1 complaint with this coat. The zipper is backwards! It has taken some getting used to in getting it started. Because of this I can only give it 3 stars. Other than that, it's stylish, lightweight yet very warm."
3,Other prompts are online for free,"Even though it is nicely edited and have some good ideas, other prompts are online for free. I found that it is a good discussionBook, for opening new discussion ideas and also good for creativeWriting. Suits kids and kids only."
4,Helpful for the Classroom,I use this book to help my students pick writing prompts for their writing workshop. It has been helpful when ideas are needed quickly.
2,Damaged Packaging,I refused delivery of this table because the package was badly damaged. I know Amazon would have replaced the item but returning such a large item would have been a real hassle.
3,More Information Needed,"Can you please list the complete set of recordings that are on this box set. In particulat is Vehicle, by The Ides of March included? Thank you."
2,Very Disappointed,"I recently purchased this CD, and was most disappointed to find that the vocals of Ben E King could only be faintly heard on the first four songs. The music is good, but I purchased this CD to listen to Ben E King, not instrumentals.I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone."
4,Good Reference for a Delphi/XML Programmer,This book is not a beginner's guide. You will feel helpful if you need some guides in XML programming with Delphi.
2,"A valiant effort, but it fails.","Remember those cheesy kung fu movies from the 1970s - how bad the dialogue was when dubbed into English? The words of the original songs in French fit every note, change and nuance of the music, but here it sounds like a very bad translation that should have been left alone. The musical arrangements - lots of synthesizers, and overamplified guitars, destroy what's left of the music. perhaps that is the biggest sin in some of the tracks: to try to artificially make them sound contemporary. For the French impaired the album as well as its companion ""Intoxicated Man"", serve as an introduction to the music and words of Serge Gainsbourg. Hopefully at best, this won't discourage English language listeners from seaching out and acquiring the real thing. It sounds a whole lot better in the original French language and arrangements: Trust me!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Should be a choice for zero stars. This book is freshwater only, author wastes your time ranting about anti-environmental political issues and obscure areas with no fish. Many good areas are reviewed, but author's anti-everything commentary about what he doesn't like (which is a lot)is a turn off. Proofreading is awful, it shows in nearly every page. Good book for a child since it has pretty pictures. Amazon deleted my more detailed review, if you want to give this book a chance suggest browsing through your local area with a copy first, guaranteed you will pass it by after."
1,The Worst Culture Club Item I Ever Bought,"As a Culture Club fan for many years, this DVD was a horrible disappointment. I'm not sure what the Boy was thinking when he put on the first outfit. The only thing I can imagine is that he used it as a distraction from his singing. I thought something was wrong with the DVD because it sounded warped. Then I realized that the band sounded fine, it was just George's singing. He was way off key and sounded like he had a sore throat. I saw the reunion concert in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed it-I don't know what happened here. George didn't appear to have the same enthusiasm he usually projects. Thank God this wasn't my first experience with the group or I never would have listened to them again. A better choice for others would be the Greatest Hits DVD which includes the concert A Kiss Across the Ocean."
4,Beautiful platter,"I bought two of these to give as gifts when they were on sale for only $5 each. Such a deal! They are pretty (the two little polar bear cubs in the bottom right corner are so cute) and perfect for the holidays or winter special occasions. I also like that they are heavy enough not to break easily. The only problem I had was one of the platters had a print defect on the top edge - a small black #2 was printed into the pine needles design. (The other platter was fine.) I contacted Amazon.com and they said I can return the platter for a replacement. This is an inconvenience, but I still like the platters."
3,WWE suffers without Jeff Hardy,"This was the first ppv wwe had in a long time without jeff hardy. It was okay, but if jeff was on the card, i t would have been that much better. I've seen kids writing reviews about him lately and I agree with all of them."
4,Pretty good pay-per-view,4/5 Team Angle vs. Eddie and ChavoGood opener. Great tag team action.2/5 Rikishi vs. Sean O'haireBoring. The only cool part was O'haire's finisher.5/5 RVD and Kane vs. DudleysBetter than the opening tag team match. One of the top matches of the night.4/5 Rey Mysterio vs. Big ShowDidn't expect much out of this but it turned out pretty good.5/5 John Cena vs. Brock LesnarGreat match. Cena's first big match and it was good.5/5 Six Man TagReally good. Hunter used his sledgehammer in the end.3/5 Rock vs. GoldbergIt was okay. It was a little too overhyped. Big dissapointment.Overall a pretty good pay-per-view. A must see.
2,alright,"i didnt even finish this book because it was blah blah blah. i am a person who love books that will keep my attention, i like novels that has drama and twist to them, if you ae that kind of person this book is not for you. it didnt hold my attention long enough to finish the book"
2,Not very good unless you have nothing better to do,"This book was really put together in a hurry. There are a lot of mistakes, both spelling and just plain wrong answers. The are 4 final practice tests in this book and they seem to be all the same. Testing the same type of question over and over again. Really there is only in total 2 practice tests where questions might be different. The questions really didn't prep you well enough to give you an idea of what the actual test has. Again this book is good if you have exausted all other avenues and are just looking for another angle of testing. In my opinion, don't waste your time."
4,works well!,Bought this for a friend. Was the only part that would have worked to bring his lathe back to life. Solid piece and came in a timely manner. Gave 4 stars as it wasn't for me so no practical use with it but it locked on and spun up just fine.
3,Seduction kept my attention!,"I bought this an audiobook, and it was great fun to listen to on a road trip.I love period novels, and this one was fun, because the romance was good, also. The lead woman in the book has a strong backbone, and is very interesting, and the old fashioned romance part of it ""ain't"" bad either!Very enjoyable!"
1,Hated it and here's why:,"I hated Sophy most of the book. She was a liar and a nag. She never behaved as if she loved Julian. She had no honor. She was always deceiving him or sneaking around. I was totally disgusted when she drugged him. All male bashing was annoying. I didn't like the ex-prostitute Charlotte either. Instead of blackmailing her former paramours, she would have been better off saving her money or pawning the jewelry they gave her. Those men owed her nothing. That's akin to paying for a dinner twice--once when you eat it and again a year later."
2,Really What Is This Book About??,"I was given this book for Christmas this past Christmas 2005.In my opinion it's one of the worst books I own. The pictures are great, but otherwise I have no use for this book.It has a few poems, and a few comments from some people, maybe a one or 2 tea recipes, but nothing that makes me happy to have this book.This book does not inform you on how to serve or host a tea party for your friends. Not very informative at all about tea parties in my opinion.I think this is a book of personal preference. If you can preview this book before purchasing it...I strongly suggest that you do to see if you would like to own it.This is not a book I would reccomend."
5,gift,"I got this for my brother , it is such a good movie especially for those who love space and old movies"
4,Rocket Man Going To Fly Away.,"This charming movie stars Bill Campbell as a young, clean-cut pilot who ends up getting accidently shot down by some FBI agents while test flying a plane. In the process, the crooks the Feds were chasing stash the stolen goods in the airplane hanger. Cliff (Campbell) finds the stolen goods and begins his adventures as the Rocketeer. The movie co-stars Jennifer Connelly as Cliff's girlfriend, Alan Arkin as Cliff's mentor, and Timothy Dalton as a Hollywood screen idol/secret Nazi spy.The film is full of family friendly action. The sets are marvelous and the costumes are just right for the era. In fact, the tone of the film is perfect for the time (1938) it is set in. Like many others, I'm not quite sure why this movie was never really big at the BO. I remember seeing it during my freshman year in high school with my kid brother and we both loved it and still do."
4,Correction,"...Pretty good sound mix. The picture could be much better. It is shaky in some places. But Jennifer Connelly still looks great.The movie feels like an old time serial that you used to see on Sat. mornings. It's clear who the good and bad guys are...Exciting, funny, romantic...Definitely a great movie!! I highly recommend it!!"
2,"Great movie, cruddy transfer","For those of you who don't know about this movie, read the other posts here. What I'm going to talk about is the poor video quality of this release.To start, the framing has been noticably cropped from its original 2.35:1 Panavision scope aspect ratio. If you are familiar with the original widescreen/letterbox laserdisc that Disney released, you'll find that this DVD sports the exact same composite video transfer with all of its inherent problems intact. No new high definition master was created for this release.The only thing of merrit is that the ORIGINAL 5.1 surround track was used to encode it to Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Yup, the packaging is in error. You're in for a treat as the split surround channels are pretty darn active considering it was mixed in the early days of 5.1 digital surround equipped cinemas.Hopefully, Disney will re-do this DVD in the near future. They created a fresh transfer for The Santa Clause SE, so why not the superior The Rocketeer??"
5,BLU-RAY RELEASE REVIEW - WOW!,"This movie has always been one of my favorites from when I was a kid. I was dismayed by the poor quality of the picture on the original DVD release, and had nearly given up hope of a re-release to Blu-ray after a couple years' waiting. A couple of weeks back, however, I was stunned that it was about to hit Blu-ray, and immediately pre-ordered my copy, sat the family down and surprised them with it the night it came in.The sound and picture quality are amazing ... the film never looked or sounded this good. I also noticed that the team in charge of preparing the release cleaned up some of the special effects so that they would not look too dated on today's high-def televisions. The result is a movie that looks like it hit theaters just a few weeks ago, not twenty years ago.If you like the movie, do yourself a favor and pick the new Blu-ray up!"
5,husband pleased,This is another movie my husband has been looking for . Also a late Christmas gift. He really enjoyed this one.
3,Great Movie but check the details,"This is a very entertaining movie, great story, great acting, great music. BUT when I ordered it I wanted to make sure it was a widescreen format. The version I got is widescreen but it is a fullscreen letterbox. I see now that the details for the movie say letterbox. I'll have to be more careful next time I order a dvd."
3,"Great movie, lame DVD","When the special features consist of: 1) the theater trailer, and 2) ads for more movies, you know you've got a Lame DVD on your hands. In its bid to be the World's Lamest DVD, this one also features a terrible-looking pixellated transfer.Deleted scenes? Commentaries? Other languages? Translations of the German phrases spoken? You will find none of those here. Can there be a special edition, please?The movie's pretty good, though."
3,It's okay,"I'm really disappointed with Billboard's music collections. You'd think that one of the most respected music publications out there would put together compilations better than the ones they're offering.I wasn't born until the mid-70's but I deeply appreciate the music of the 60's, which defined culture then and still does to this day. I recognize the vast majority of the hits in their collections but some selections just scream, ""Filler!""If you want good compliations, Entertainment Weekly offers excellent ones. There are more songs and they include hits that were lower on the charts but that people, nonetheless, still love.BTW: On the back of the disc to the 1964 collection there is a note saying that because of licensing restrictions, The Beatles songs were not included. Otherwise, that year would have been entirely them (or at least a good 7 of the 10 songs)."
5,More on the roots of Raistlin,"Journey further into the realm of Dragonlance, finding out more of the young mage's adventures, all leading up to his discovery of who he truly is, who he shall truly become. Raistlin's history becomes more and more clear with each turn of the page."
5,A great book from the world of DragonLance,"The Soulforge was one of the best books I have ever read and I enjoyed reading the sequel. Margaret Weis describes perfectly Raistlin's feelings and problems in an amazing fantasy world. The only thing I dislike in this book is the fact, that the story is too much focused on Kitiara."
1,YEECH,"Hello? I read this book and was aghast at several things. Are you sure MW had anything to do with this book? It seems like the work of a different author... Like previous other dragonlance spin-offs, this book had several glaring errors in protraying Raistlin, Kitaira, Caramon and other minor characters from previous books. For a die hard fan like me this meant that it totally spoilt my enjoyment of the book. Bleah. In any case I note that several readers have observed this as well. I should have listened to them before buying this book. The Raistlin (and Caramon) in this book do not bear much similarity to the twins in Chronicles or Legends (what little we know of their past before the War of the Lance and beyond)in past or manner. For those who have not seen the light, I suggest you go read the earlier books AGAIN before embarking on this book. On the other hand, maybe it is better if you just re-read the earlier chronicles and forget about this book."
2,"If you're desperate, buy this book","The title is ""let's speak Thai"" but I'm afraid I found that misleading. After using it, I sure can't speak Thai. It will not help you to carry on a conversation in Thai. The romanization is hard to understand. The CD is okay, but was too limited to do any good for me. Thai is a very difficult language - even for other SE Asian language speakers. If you want to learn the language and have a meaningful, if simple, conversation with a Thai, I'd recommend applying your money to another medium. However, if you're desperate for a book that has Thai in it because you're going to land in Thailand in 24 hours, it might do (that's how it gets two stars)."
3,Um yeah,This a very difficult album to take ( then again what Diamanda album isn't difficult ). Her 4 octave voice is so convincing on it's own that you would be hard pressed but just submitting yourself as a slave to her. Her voice is that really that powerful. The only thing though is that about this album is that it is a vocal acrobatic work out for her. There's nothing else but her voice and when it hits the right notes.....what's left for you is to shrivel up in the corner of your bedroom and pray that her voice doesn't eat you up alive.Venture if you dare but be warned.......Mummy ain't here to save you
2,I don't understand...,"This album is like ""vena cava""... There are only screams,some seconds of silence, and a voice who reads excerpts from autors like Tommaso d'Aquino.Diamanda is a very good vocalist, but are you sure you want to buy only screams?I understand the concept in the album (I think the mental dementia of an HIV+), but I prefer ""plague mass"", the ""masque of the red death"" or her blues albums.Sorry"
5,Civil War History,"A new insite into the Civil War and the heartache it brought. A must see by any/all Civil War buffs and history nuts. Realize it is a movies, but happenings like this did happen. Great in your Civil War Library."
5,LONG BUT MORE THAN WORTH IT,I saw this movie back in middle school (eighth grade?) and I was SHOCKED by what I saw. I couldn't believe how horrible things were at that time. My teacher could not have chosen a better movie to depict this time period. Bravo! and many thanks to teachers who show this.
3,Great light,"I bought this light kit to replace a kit I had bought earlier. One of the lenses fell off the old set.The light is bright enough to be seen even in dense fog. One will not be missed when thins light is on, that's for sure.One thing that I did not like and or enjoy was the discription, it is a bit on the decptive side you only get one light, I was led to believe the I was going to get two lights a set, as the pic shows."
5,KISS Collectibles-Orginal Greatness!,"My dad is a HUGE fan of KISS! He had these figurines once, years ago (he had somehow lost them) and it was upsetting for him!! He had EVERYTHING you could EVER imagine...no joke! Father's Day and for his birthday, I ordered these for him, since they've been so hard to find, I came across these, automatically put in an order, so that these can be shipped straight to my dad, in time for his special occasions :) Great gift, especially if you are a huge fan! KISS is a legacy, that'll never die, no matter what!!"
3,How many entries?,"No information is given in the Amazon Product Description as to the number of word entries in this dictionary. The sample pages viewable show text widely spaced, so that the fact that it has 800 pages does not necessarily mean it has a large number of entries. One wonders how it compares in completeness with the Modern Hebrew-English Dictionary by Shimshon Inbal, for example. Prospective buyers need to know such things! Why should we put out $30 just to discover that the coverage is minimal? Otherwise, I like the layout, visible in the online excerpt. I *might* be interested in buying it, if the publisher and Amazon had given more information. The one reviewer on the Amazon website does not say how many entries it has, if he knows."
3,topics are OK. poorly written,"Believe me, I have read many many textbooks. Not one is like this book. The problem is that the authors don't explain, to an extent where terms are not clearly defined. I have to frequently stop and GUESS what the authors mean by the symbols and terms, and writing something in that particular way. The flow of understanding is constantly stopped by these intensionally introduced hurdles. I say intensional because from the preface of the book I see that the authors are pretty proud of that.I think I am already quite good at guessing what the authors of other books occasionally skip. But this one really annoys me. I think it is really a waste of time to have to guess something that is just basic definition."
5,Check this one out!!,This the 1st cd from Othello & the Hipknotics - it is great! hip hop with a great jazzy background. Othello has a smooth mellow style - no hard jarring jabs. I really like the intro welcoming you to the record. The music is as important as the message Othello is sharing. To me if Will Smith & Chris Botti made a cd this is what it would sound like. Worth the import price.FYI: this cd is #3 in Japan right now
2,Same Advice Grandpa Gave Me,"Reading this book is like eating leftovers. Warmed over finacial basics. The author offers few fresh ideas and certainly nothing that will even mildly improve my life style.Someone will live better if you buy this book, it just won't be you."
4,It's all about art,"A wonderful record, truely recommandable for those who haven't heard about TG. A nice record which covers some of the band's work. Best song: 'Hot on the heels of love' (ever heard about C&C?), what a tune......"
2,Throbbing Gristle,"I came across this quite by accident, looking for early industrial scene samples. This is very hard work to listen to, although I suppose it may grow on me. The ""discipline"" tracks are quite amusing to listen to, especially trying to notice the differences. However, if this is typical of the early scene, I think it could only have got better."
1,Horrible old industrial crap,"This album is basically just computerized, repetitive keyboard sounds with weird nonsensical talking over it (""Persuasion"") from over 9000 years ago. It's not even revolutionary or influential like everyone says. It's just horrible generic crap, it almost sucks as much as Nine Inch Nails. Stick to Marylin Manson, Orgy or Rob Zombie for TRUE industrial!"
3,Billboard top hits 1985-1989 box set,"I was just going to buy this music box set when I suddenly remembered two great songs of 1985, which are: Born in the USA and Careless Whisper. Am I wrong? or weren't they hits? Where are they? I think they could have left out two other songs and included the ones I mentioned, because they were #1 hits. It just got me thinking that this box set is really not so great."
5,perfect,Great CD all time classic plays perfectly as always lynyrd skynyrd classic ! Love it. A must for every collection
1,Innyrds,Something is off with the songs on this one? I can't put my finger on it but Free Bird lacks energy or something? I am getting rid of this one and finding a different CD of theirs.
4,the Towel Thrown In,"Not ""the last"" , as TG have recently reformed for live and studio work, but definately the end of an era. The best - and most subversive - thing about this decidedly lo-fi recording is the fact that audience members can be clearly heard talking during the quieter moments, and you'd be surprised ( or maybe not ) at some of the things they say. Vocalist Genesis P-Orridge sounds somewhat tired, almost defeated, on some tracks - maybe he knew it was the end of the road for TG - but the sound of the band is as powerful as you would expect. Not the first live TG to buy ( get the ""live-in-the-studio"" Heathen Earth instead ) but a worthy addition to round out your collection."
5,One-of-a-kind!,"I love minor-league hockey, which is what the Zambonis sing about, so this disc was a must-own for me. The standout songs on this CD are ""Johnny got Suspended"" (for wearing an Islanders sucks t-shirt, oh yes he did), ""Bob Marley and the Hartford Whalers"" (big ups for mentioning the Quebec Nordiques too) and the super cute ""Hockey Monkey"" - although ""The Wait"" best describes fans of my local team! Personally, I love the ska flavor of ""The Breakaway"" - it is my favorite song on this CD. I also like the little chants and stuff they put on here, like ""Hextall"" and ""Drop That Puck"". It's hella fun to listen to in the car on the way to the game (we always end up singing along) or in the summer, personally when I miss the ice most."
1,Awful,"I used this on our deck a few years ago and it began peeling almost right away. I used this particular stain because Consumer Reports recommended it at the time. Last year, I stripped the entire deck and got it all off. I then applied a different brand of stain and it looks great."
2,Returned,"This shaver is way too bulky for my hands. It takes 'C' batteries, which might hint to the enormous size of the thing. Additionally, the 'on' switch must be turned on AND held down to operate it. This seems like a safety mechanism, but I've owned several clothing shavers and never had any safety problems. I returned it."
5,"Not a Punk at all: Just a Modern, Rocking Ben E. King","This guy never made it big commercially, and that is a mystery to me. Another reviewer compared him to the boss and to Southside Johnny. There is the grit overlap with Bruce, and the r&b similarities to the Asbury Jukes, but to me he is a rockin' and kickin' Ben E. King who can growl or croon as needed. The Latin rhythms he brings to his brand of street rock always made it sparkle for me. As good as his recordings were, seeing him live (just a few rows back at the Stone Pony) was magical. His rock was modern for its day, but so informed by earlier r&b. Truly a treat for the ears."
2,Not Accurate,"I have 17 hardy kiwi plants in various stages of maturity and they are much more colorful and beautiful than this picture. The leaf petioles are red and the leaves them selves are a brighter green. Also the flowers with their white, radiating stigmas and the vigorous, twining new growth are characteristic of this plant. As ""art"" maybe this is an attractive picture, but as representative of the plant, not even close."
4,Great musical snapshots from the early 1980s,"I listened to completely different kinds of music at the time, so I didn't have many memories attached to these songs. The musical quality of the songs is actually suprisingly good, and the mastering has been done well. This is a nice review of hits of the early 1980s. Ten songs per CD isn't much, so there could have been more songs from each year."
5,An excellent fitness and healthy life book,"I have read many fitness books and this has been my favorite. I could not put it down. Not only does Gomes share her personal story of weight gain and loss, but she takes you step by step through the process to help you change your life as well. No magic diet pills here, just good common sense and finding the strength to stand up to all the excuses once and for all."
4,A good peppermint tea,"This is a good, tasty peppermint tea that is very soothing for digestive and post-digestive functions. I enjoyed it, but I did eventually find a better value with Celestial Seasonings 40-pack boxes, with even a more minty taste that I enjoyed just a bit more."
4,Cervantes-Walls Spanish/English Dictionary,"This is a good dictionary for Latin American Spanish -- but it is not the best dictionary for the Spanish spoken in Spain. The best aspect is the type -- bold and very clear, big enough to read easily in dim light of a restaurant. There are many cognates, which helps when looking for expressions and idioms."
1,Broke after 2 months of light use,"Well this product was great at first. Used it in our car for our ipod and it sounded great. But two months later and it no longer works correctly. The music only plays from one speaker. We tried a differnt cord and it works fine so its not a problem with the speaker, just with this cord. I think this is a case of you get what you pay for. I suggest spending more money and getting a better quality cord."
2,"Fine, but doesn't last very long.","Retracting mechanism was iffy from the start, but the audio quality suffered after less than 6 months of mild use in my car."
2,Not great,"The stars are for the aesthetic and ergonomic of the design. As for functionality, this cable is a piece of junk. It only allows sound to one speaker, and the sound is trebly and buzzy. I could only bear to use it for a few minutes before throwing it away. As for the retractable feature.. it doesn't work that well, it jams and the cord does not protract very far. My advice would be to save up for a highly quality, way more functional cable."
3,"Eh....not the same as pictured, no brand name on it.","The product I received was not what was described. I did get a cable ""SIMILAR"" to the one pictured, but it was not a Scosche brand name. It appears to be a generic knock-off, but what can you expect from the price. The cable does work fine and I have no issues with it, I'm just a little urked over the false advertising."
4,As Expected.,"Works well, thin cable but works fine. I like it very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,very, very much."
1,Stopped working,I bought this cable over two months ago and suddenly it stopped playing the audio correctly. A lot of garbling noise. I though this ws going to be a good buy but i just wasted my money.
2,Meh....,"I wanted to like them. Bought one for myself and one as a gift. At first mine worked great. I loved that the cords were retractable and the sound (for a $5 cable) was good in my car. I gave the other one as a gift to my boyfriend. His never retracted again after the first use. Returned his, the shipping to get the replacement was quick. Two days later mine broke. His replacement works OK but the retracting mechanism doesn't really work as good as hoped, and his sounds better than mine. My replacement sounds worse than the first one and the retracting mechanism has never worked right. All in all I feel meh about them. BUT for $5 you can't really be too upset... Also to note- we both use these cables exclusively in our cars which are both Subaru's and in my opinion sound could be MUCH better...."
3,So so...,I wanted to keep my car free and clear of cables so I purchased a retractable cable to at least keep it more organized. The retractable part works fine but the cable is pretty thin. I hooked it up to my stereo and I could here a lot of static. I then tried a not retractable cable that was pretty thick and the static was gone and the sound was a lot better. You have to sacrifice sound for clutter free cables or go with sound and have wires all over. I stopped using this since I couldn't stand the static. I am not sure if its the cable I got or not but I will stick to the non retractable cable. I'll just have to find a short one since the 3 foot one I have is too long.
1,Not as Advertised,"The Item sent by seller VortexCable (which is sponsored by amazon and currently sells the cable for 80 cents) is not the cable advertised. This cable is not made by Scosche and is much poorer build quality. I have had the scosche cable as it is advertised as and it works great. However this piece of junk is loose when plugged in and the retraction mechanism locks up and is much more bulky. VortexCable is the cheapest seller is the cheapest seller, but order from someone else. I have tried contacting the seller with no response. I will be filing a claim with Amazon."
1,cable breaks,"Scosche IU3.5RC 3.5mm Retractable CableI bought one of these and loved it -- until the cable wore and then broke near one of the plug-ends. It's a GREAT concept, but shabbily made. I replaced it with a short male-to-male non-retractable cable that has worked fine with no problems. Avoid Scosch products until they have a better return policy."
1,Scratchy Poor Connection,"Maybe I just got a bad one, but it was definitely a piece of junk. It seemed to fit too loosely in the jack. I had to do that thing where you twist it around in the jack to try to get good sound. Scritchy scratchy. And I never did get the full sound.I've replaced it with a non-retractable good quality Belkin cable which fits tightly in the jacks and works great. Save your money on this thing and spend a little more on something reliable."
4,Scosche retractable 3.5 mm audio cable,"This is a neat product, exactly as advertised and works great with portable audio devices. Yes, it's possible to get the retractor stuck but was not hard to get it working again and is not hard to avoid. The cable is a little on the thin side but it doesn't seem to affect audio quality."
4,Good option for use in car for MP3 players,"Overall it is a good product. It works, sound quality is decent, you do not have a bunch of wires all over the place. It serves its purpose and is at a good price.Only draw back is unless you pull both ends at the same time the cord can get stuck in the retracting part of the device. Usually does not take long to unwind the cord again."
1,Never again,Seller lost this package at their facility and it took 2 months to receive it. I bought it as a gift and i'm glad it took too long to get here. it's flimsy and gets really tangled really easy. avoid at all costs.
1,Too short and too flimsy,"The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary. I just got it, so I don't know yet how long they will last, they don't make you feel comfortable using them.If I put my iphone in my pant pocket and use this at it's maximum extension to connect to my noise canceling headphone, it is not long enough for that. And I am only 5'10"". If I kept my iphone in a belt case it would probably be just enough.On top of this, I experienced the opposite of what some users have written. For me, it was just too eager to retract, and I was constantly trying to get it locked in at the max extension.I would NOT buy this again nor would I recommend it."
1,Not very good,"I purchased this for my car with the idea that a retractable cable would keep my car clean. Unfortunately, the retracting mechanism doesn't work very easily. Also, the cable is way too thin, enough to make you feel like it could rip at any point you pull on it. Low quality product that only lasted me a week."
1,junk,"Came out of the box broken. Would not buy a retractable, the wire is two thin to take the use of retracting. Buy a straight cable."
1,Poor Quality,"This did not work for long (sound quality very poor). The retractable cable must, by design, be very slim in size. Better to get a larger diameter cable that doesn't retract."
1,not correct cable for Roc Aviators,"It seems ridiculous that this cable would appear on a search for replacementcable for Roc Aviators, It is not the correct cable."
3,short cord,This item is not bad but the retractable cord is too short. Otherwise It is easy to carry around and serves its purpose
1,Does NOT extend 6 feet!,"As stated on the packaging, this ""3.5 to 3.5 Male Cable Extends to 2.5 feet of Cable Length"" - NOT 6 feet.Buyer Beware!"
4,"Good product, BAD PRICES!","I like the product and it does a great job of knocking down the population but man is the price way too much. I wish someone would sell this stuff in bigger bottles too, for the price it's just expensive.It's almost cheaper in the long run to get a Mosquito Vacuum setup.96oz = 3/4 gallon = not that much to work with at all!Should be half the price if not less for a full gallon."
1,Poor quality lid,"I had a very similar travel mug from about a decade ago that was purchased from starbucks. Same twist top lid that is pretty spill resistant. The one I had was old and scratched up, so I was looking for an upgrade. When I found this, I was thrilled. It looked just like my old starbucks mug, but I could get it in colors instead of just stainless steel! After using the mug a total of 4 times, the screw that allows the lid to close and become spill resistant loosened. It would spill all over if I barely tilted the mug, as if the lid wasn't there. After I figured out the problem, I figured I could just tighten the screw... Nope ... After each time I opened the mug, the screw would loosen again. This was a complete waste of money for me. If spill resistant is what you are looking for, look elsewhere."
2,not what I expected,I am teaching a three year old to swim and was loking for some ideas and games. This book was no help.
4,60 Minutes of Zappacosta,Yes this CD definately met my expectations. I'm thoroughly enjoying listening to it. I have recommended that others purchase it. Fantastic!!
3,Sizing?,"I ordered a different model with the same brand for my daughter and the sizing wasn't even close. She had a 1.5 last year in the model that uses velcro so I ordered a 3 this year. They were smaller than the 1.5 last year. Her true foot size is a 3. Nothing bad with the quality of the shoe but the sizing needs some work. If you need to order this shoe, size up 1 to 2 sizes."
2,"Good explanations for ""Why"" bad explanations for ""How""","This DVD spends a great deal of time explaining the benefits of signing to you child and ways to make it fun but doesn't spend enough time showing parents any actual signs to learn or teach their babies. If you are already convinced that you and your child want to learn sign language then this product won't offer much more information than that. In all, there were only a handful of examples of signs being shown and I don't believe it is worth the money if your looking for dictionary-type or reference video."""
2,Not fun for the kid!,"I got this DVD after my daughter much enjoyed learning to sign with the DVD's ""Baby Signing Time"". Those DVD's used kids and an adult in a fun & interactive way to learn to sign. There's baby ones and then ones for bigger kids. My daughter loved these DVD's and asked to watch them every day.This DVD is too informational for parents.. it's not really fun for kids to learn to sign from it. It's basically giving parents a tutorial on how to go about it and info about it. Not what I thought I was getting. We watched it once.. what a waste.If this is your first venture into signing, it might be helpful.. but not worth the money they're selling it for.. I reccomend checking out your local library, mine had many books and dvd's that were very helpful. (I liked ""Signing for hearing babies"" or somtething along those lines, good read, very helpful)"
5,A welcome contribution!,"Mr. Sherden gives us a welcome contribution to a growing appreciation of chaotic and complex systems. I chose this book for my web site's monthly book review because of it's depth of resources and scope of disciplines addressed. The book is not a superficial debunking, and inspires a growing sensitivity to non-linear systems. Without preaching or whining, this book helps us take an openminded approach to the inherent power and limits of prognostication."
2,NOT AS EXPECTED!,"I was hoping some of the recipes and suggestions would work, but so far, not much luck! I tried the all purpose cleaner on my floor and it made a smeary, dull-looking mess. I tried the alcohol on the poison ivy in my flower bed and it seemed to thrive; sprayed it 3 times! I am getting disgusted and don't want to try anything else. All I do is waste my ""supermarket"" products. Most of the ""fixes"" I already knew about but I think I would rather purchase an all in one cleaner from the supermarket!!"
1,"Old, heavy, clunky and hard to use","I was excited to finally get a remote that is easy to use, based on the many positive reviews I read. I was very disappointed that the remote seems like it was made many years ago - it even has directions on how to set it up to control your tape deck and turntable. It didn't control any of my components the way it should have. I didn't have the patience to spend any more time programming it, so I returned it. Perhaps if I set up multiple macro commands it would have been better."
3,Nice Artwork but Lack Usefulness,Nice artwork in the form of black-and-white line-art but limited usefulness and these pictures are not provided on CD-ROM. Would have at least given 4 stars if a CD-ROM with the pictures in various graphics file format is provided.
3,Not up to the previous standard,"I imagine Robbie Coltrane and Jimmy McGovern had high hopes for this reunion. But apparently Mr. McGovern had a political ax to grind that got in the way of creating a truly Fitz-worthy yarn. And the episode seemed lacking in Fitz for stretches of time, much of which was spent establishing the state of mind driving a killer. And then Fitz found himself working alone, alone without the dynamic generated among his familiar cast of disparagers at the Manchester PD. None of those cops are even present in this episode, perhaps having read the script before signing on. Instead we see a squad of strangers whose character and disposition have no time to develop. And the dark, gritty look of the earlier episodes has been dressed up with a number of sunny scenes quite out of keeping with our expectation of Fitz's Manchester. Altogether not a fitting tribute to a superior series."
1,Let it go,"Old fat detectives that don't grow up? Charming back in 1993 not so much anymore. I got the set when it didn't include this one and it was intriguing and charming, and who doesn't love Robbie Coltrane, but as you can see, so far, only 3 reviewers gave this a 5 star, now go and see the reviews for the old Cracker Series and you'll see how far the mighty have fallen."
2,Nice Product but won't work for our needs,"Took thick between doors- we bought Kidco product instead. We like these more because they are clear but maybe just work on sliding outside doors and we needed for interior passthrough and bi-fold doors, which they are too thick for."
4,Working for us!,I have an escape-artist 2-yo who has mastered every childproofing item I've ever bought. So far this is working for us!
4,Did not work for us,"I can see how this would work on sliding glass doors or somewhere that the child could not reach the actual lock. However, we bought it based on a few of the other reviews to use on our entertainment center's sliding doors to keep the baby out of the dvd/xbox/tivo area. At first we were really impressed, nice, small, clear and easy to use. However, in a matter of days my 17 month old had simply pushed so hard on the pop-up piece that it broke and is now useless. I am going to give it a good review because, like I said, if you use it for it's intended purpose, it probably works very well, but not where the baby can reach it - 1 star in that case. Back to the drawing board!"
4,Best Remote I've Owned,"I love this remote. Got it for Christmas 2004 (use it in my bed room) and ended up buying another one at the end of 2005 (use in my living room).BOTTOM LINE: Best remote for the price. If I lost it I would definitely replace it.WHY I LOVE THIS REMOTE: Relatively cheap for feature set, lighted keys for using it in the dark, learning ability for those buttons that don't translate from device remote, upgradable over the phone, controls everything I own, but one device.THINGS I DISLIKE: The buttons that accept learning are near the bottom of the remote and it's hard to use these keys with one hand. Actually all the keys under the VCR/DVR buttons are hard to use with one hand (fyi... I'm a petite woman with small hands so this may not be a problem for those with larger hands to balance and reach the bottom buttons). The remote is heavier than any other remote I have. The remote can't control my Sharp projector."
2,Not at all pleased with this,"I have another One For All remote and love it. They work well ONLY if they support the units you have. The first unit I bought works with ALMOST everything I bought it for two years ago. It WOULD NOT work with my Toshiba DVD player as they provide only one source code for Toshiba DVD's. It did work the Satellite receiver, Stereo, TV, and Phillips DVD/VCR.Now up to present date. I just got a Direct TV Satellite Reciever so I wanted to be able to control the T.V., DVD, Stereo, and Satellite dish. I purchased the URC 8910 and it will not work with the Direct TV nor the Toshiba units so I sadly sent it back for refund. My point is not to bash these good remotes in as much as to warn you they may not support all units and to hopefully get the manufacturer to add these units to their remotes, however in the last two years they have stubbornly left my Toshiba DVD player. I am not the only complaint concerning this exact omission.Gary A.Euless, Texas"
1,poor quality,When I programmed this remote the first day it worked fine. After a couple of days it lost all the codes and would not let me program it again.
4,Good remote....Great Price!,"I purchased the remote because the price was great. The remote works well and has a ton of great features. The learning buttons are easy to use and program.The only cons I found were the size of the remote (it's rather large) and tends to be a bit heavier than most remotes. If you don't car much about the appearance and size, you won't be disappointed with this remote."
5,Great remote,This remote does everything it promises.. and if you don't find the code in the manual a quick call (they actually answer pretty quick) and they download the new codes via phone tone.. you stick the remote by your speakerphone and it programs it instantly.. and the price is unbeatable..
2,Not enough Programmable Keys,"This could have been a great remote. I bought it so that I could program it for remotes that are not included. Although it is programmable, it is limited to the number of buttons that can be programmed and this to me is a flaw on One For All part. I may sell this and get a real programmable remote."
1,Runs out of memory; loses mem w/ battery change,"At first I really dug this remote. But it didn't have a few of my devices preprogrammed. The Hughes DirecTV/TiVo receiver is more uncommon, but a Toshiba DVD player? Come on!Nonetheless, I was not phased. It's a learning remote afterall. Well, kind of. After learning several keys (maybe 20), the memory filled up. After that, it wouldn't learn any more, wouldn't program any more macros, wouldn't copy keys to other devices (keymover). In short, All In One skimped on memory to the point where this remote is unuseable.It was also not working on occassion. I'd point and shoot and the TV didn't change channels. I thought it might be the batteries. Lo and behold, when I changed the batteries - all of my programming was lost!!! This is a few hours work if one is customizing the functionality and programming macros for several devices.I had to return the unit and won't buy another All In One. Mine wasn't defective, it was poorly designed!"
4,It works but,"The only major complaint I have is the remote's memory capacity. I have a Samsung DLT TV, a ReplayTV PVR, a Panasonic home theater box, a RCA HDTV tuner, and a Pinnacle MediaCenter player. I was able to set the remote up to (partially) control all but the last one - the momery was already full that I couldn't do anything with the last one. And I said ""partially"" because many keys I wanted the remote to learn it couldn't - the memory was full. It would be much nicer had the remote had 5X momery size. Beisides that, the remote works fine. I haven't used the ""upgrade"" feature yet."
1,IMPOSSIBLE,"I have had this remote for 2 months - works on everything but my home theater system (Samsung HT-Z310). Tried the learning feature, no good. Tried calling customer support - for the last 3 weeks all I get is a message saying they are having ""technical difficulties"". This thing is pretty useless without the updated codes. I bought it because reviews said tech support and the remote itself were highly rated. Huge mistake!"
2,cant upgrade,I bought this unit a couple of years ago. It was great. I recently got new equipment and went to site to call to upgrade codes but the phone numbers given on the site and in the manual are not available....disconnected or old and I used the one on their site. So what good is an upgradeable remote when you cant get customer service.
5,Lots of fun,I like exercising with gadgets and this DVD was lots of fun and just the right length at 30 minutes.I also enjoy this instructor and use her weighted ball workout.
2,They really mean 1 application,"I have not been satisfied with this water heater. When they say it is for 1 application, they mean it. If you are taking a shower, and someone washes their hands at a sink, the shower will get cold. Also, you basically have to turn the water on at almost full blast for the heater to kick on. If the pressure is too low, it will just click the igniter without lighting. The warmth of the water seems to fluctuate for no reason. It will be hot for a few minutes and then get colder. I usually have to adjust the temperature in the shower at least once per shower. I live in a 2-story house with the heater in the basement. I know two other people with this heater that live in 1-story houses and do not have my issues. Keep in mind that it will be at least $50 for the parts for the re-routing of the pipes. Plan on the work taking at least 1 day, maybe 2. Also note that it takes an extra 10 seconds to get warm water over a water heater tank. This should be expected though."
1,Bosch does not stand behind their product,"We have had our water heater for 4 years, this winter the Heat Exchanger broke and the water heater poured water all over our ulitity room, ruining our floor. I called bosch, and spoke with a very rude tech support person, she stated the heat exchanger FROZE up, stating we should have winterize the water heater, so the part is not under warrenty . We never winterized the heater before. I asked to speak with her supervisor and she refused. I am going to have to buy another water heater but it will not be a Bosch."
1,After 3 years forget it,"I bought 3 of these units for my property in Hawai'i. All three have gone down and it's all the same problem - the computer control unit and the hydro generator. It costs about $400 to replace these two parts and it really bothers me. I had a pilot model that worked really well. If I were to buy again, I'd go for a paloma I'm thinking. When I called customer service, they basically got me to explain the installation of the unit and then decided without seeing the installation that it was installed improperly and then did not honor the warranty. My unit was installed by a licensed plumber and inspected by a Maui County building inspector and worked well for 3 years. The woman at Bosch however, determined just through a vocal description that there wasn't enough ""AIR"" in my house based on the square footage. It was ridiculous!! So she did not honor the warranty. Very frustrating!!"
1,Inadequate product!!,"Going to make it short and sweet. You can't drink out of the mug. . it dribbles. It is VERY leak proof!!! Email to the company in trying to resolve the issue has not generated any response. I wish they would have a solution for the problem, but evidently they don't. This is evidently more of a common problem than the exception. Feel like I wasted my money and have to throw it away. I wish they would stop selling this inadequate product and you should remove it from your list of items."
3,Dissappointed,"I received and tried the Drive Time Travel Mug - Best Mug, and it only kept the coffee hot for about 30 min. After an hour the coffee was only luke warm. All that with the top in the closed position."
3,Clearly wrritten but...,"Although Portner writes with a charming style and makes difficult problems of semantics clear, yet I feel he didn't answer the question printed on its cover. The different approaches to semantics, and their relation to the formal approach, still remain mystery to me. The lambda-abstraction was barely touched, and semantic calculus wasn't even mentioned.I've enjoyed reading it, but I must say I'd rather have purchased a more comprehensive textbook."
1,Could have been a lot better. Much left out about subject.,"A basic physics approach to low speed impact of automobiles. Author uses a strange definition of coefficient of restitution which is negative instead of positive. Little experimental data is offerred and there is no review of the current low speed impact volunteer data which is the current basis for much opinion. The free video is some graphic computer artist's crude representation of a rear end collision and depicts unrealistic vehicle, seat and occupant kinematics. However, for a rank beginner you will be exposed to the basic physics of this type of collision. For a followup you will need to read various SAE papers to really understand the practical realities of the relationship between such a collision and the outcomes."
2,Comfortable But Falling Apart,"The first pair of these slippers I received as a gift and they lasted for a year of daily wearing. They were very comfortable and good for light outdoor use. The second pair I bought off Amazon and I have worn them for less than a month. The thread has unraveled, separating the sole from the slipper on both slippers. I do like the style and comfort of the slipper but am really disappointed in the quality."
5,23 laughs for Skidoo,An incredible story with a stellar cast and directed by a legend. You won't believe it! A true cult classic.Get it while it's still around.
2,satalite code,"cannot find the satalite code for my direct tv, the other codes work for the tv,vcr and dvd. please solve this problem"
4,Works great with Tivo Series 2 and the Comcast/Cisco Digital Cable Adapter Box,"Comcast recently made all its customers (at least where we live) start using small digital cable adapter boxes. Since we had lost the original IR adapter that came with our Tivo Series 2, we bought this one as a replacement so that Tivo could control the new Cisco Comcast digital cable adapter box. It worked perfectly."
3,"Robots,NO SEX...HUH !","UNIVERSAL SOLDIERSTheasylum.ccStarring: Kristen Quintrall, Dario Deak & Noel Thurman.Directed by Griff Furst.Probably the best Sci-Fi done by Theasylum in monthes.You know, We could argue naming what it is,But let's move on.The Soldiers are somewhat SHOCK WAVES and shades of Dolph & Ahnuld.Really liked their individual skills and lack of weapon knowledge,Kind of evened the playing field.A lot of chracters that die telling us why they created an ultimate combat tool that's evolving somehow,OMG !Costumes were Classic Android meets Predator.Kristin Quintrall was drinking Way Too Much Coffee or something, Truly an energized performance.Dario Deak needs to be seen again, Great on screen prescence.Noel Thurman delivers another thankless role,That viewer needs to further plot.We see a sequel, Or a prequel would be nice seemed we picked up in the middle of goings on."
4,Earbud headset.,"I have enjoyed my new earbuds. For the price, they are wonderful. The sound is very clear. The bud is a little large,but I can work with that."
3,Good study material,This book summarizes all of the main contents of CISSP. It is a simpler version of other books with full contents. But do not rely on it 100%. Use it as a preliminary study so that you can grasp the idea of CISSP exam.
1,Disappointing,"As addicted as I was to the Prime Suspect series, I found number 7, the final episode, to be disappointing. Jane is depicted, not as the flawed human being we can identify with, but as a drunk only capable of solving her final murder because it was committed by a teenager. The British Swat team, which is so impressively depicted in episode 6, brings its power to bear on high school children in episode 7, which seems almost a symbolical drama depicting the loss of British greatness."
4,A Frustrating Genius,"Helen Mirren (IMHO)in the ""Prime Suspect"" series, puts Cagney and Lacey TO SHAME. Jane Tennyson is tough, fragile without preachy dialogue and human, without being a matyr. In other words, while watching this, the strains of ""I am woman, here me roar"" are nowhere to be found, unlike most cop shows with the main character is female. ""Prime Suspect 7"" is a wonderful and honorable tribute to this flawed, intelligent and tragic policewoman."
5,A marvelous book which completes my early family history.,"Ms. Naff's book is truly marvelous. As the granson of a Lebanese/Syrian immigrant, I read about the history of Lebanon. I knew some of the stories about my grandfather's coming to this country. There were even some vague stories about silk worms. But little did I know that my grandfather's story was the story of thousands of other men, women, and children. I knew some of Gido's contemporaries and am sad that I did not pay more attention to their stories. One of my most treasured possessions is a picture of Gido with a rifle and bandolier standing next to his wagon while peddling dry goods along the Mexico-Texas border. Thank you Ms. Naff."
1,Two books with same content.,"I have had the book ""The Writer's Complete CRIME Reference Book,"" by Martin Roth, for a long while. When I later found ""The CRIME Writer's Reference Guide 1001 Tips for Writing the Perfect Murder,"" on Amazon it appeared to me that this book was a sequel to Roth's previous book as the cover was different. However, that was not the case. The contents of these two books are identical. Two books with the same content but have different covers. Changing the name of a book should be considered a fraud. I wasted my very limited money when I purchased this!This is the first time I have ever been disappointed with Amazon."
4,Typical Weird Stuff,"Yet another anthology of weird and kooky stuff. Some of the oddest stuff ever to be put on a pair of CD's. Everything from Leonard Nimoy(Mr. Spock) singing to ""Weird Al"" making fun of yet another pop tune. From Oldies from Spike Jones & His City Slickers to new stuff from Green Jelly. All in all, if you are looking for good fun tunes. This is one of the best collections"
1,A shoddy product.,"This product is terrible. It only worked for the first day, and afterwards, it stopped functioning all together. It won't even read on the playstation 2. Its shot. End of story."
3,"Does not work with RCA HDTV, I guess.","Beside the fact that it is simple to install, I don't know much more about it... I bought it for an HDTV, and it obviously did not work. When I read ""Full compatibility with all video connections"" I automatically assumed it would work with my HDTV. I am however giving it the benefit of the doubt, if it did work with my TV it would be really fun."
4,Excellent,"Excellent book on the place of tolerance in Islam! And yes Islam just like any religion can be either tolerant or very oppressive depending on the believers interpretations. The reader/reviewer who gave one star wishes to imply that there is no tolerance in Islam and that it is just a violent religion. What childish notions, believers of all relgions have oppressed minorities and forcibly converted them. This is not an accusation that can only be leveled at just Muslims, but to all followers of any religion. Ther is ample evidence that shows contrary to popular belief Islam was NOT spread by the sword."
2,The Ipcress File,"This guy Deighton was big news when I was a kid. Reading him now, I can't for the life of me see why. This is one of those occasions - and there are more of them than readers would like to admit - on which the only reason to celebrate the existence of the book is that it enabled someone to make a reasonably good movie."
2,Too Subtle to Be Satisfying,"First off, the volume on this album has to be turned up several notches in order to hear much. Then, the mood doesn't really change. The inflections change, but there isn't a range of emotions. Maybe this is due to too much of a soprano emphasis and lower keys never come bellowing through--the small traces of them just dangle in the background.I understand that the madrigal nature of Madra is not intended to be the same Miranda Sex Garden as seen in later releases like Susperia, Carnival of Souls, or Fairytales of Slavery. But after hearing these delightful albums, Madra is too much of a letdown. For fans of MSG who are considering buying this album, I suggest you listen to samples and decide if it's for you.It does get points for the concept (I admire any artist who visits medieval culture), the beauty in the voices themselves, and the composition. It takes a lot of organization and proper synchronization to accomplish this effect."
3,I died well before Delphi,"Even Falco's wisecracks and his always eventful family life cannot disguise what is essentially a travelogue through Greece with attached mystery. This book reminded me of ""Last Act in Palmyra"" where we didn't miss a city of the Decapolis. I am a Falco fan, and I wish Lindsey Davis inspiration as she writes his next adventure. However, William Broad's recent book THE ORACLE, the search for the truth about the oracle of Delphi, is a better mystery by far."
4,a charming read,"Lindsey Davis never fails to provide a fun read. Though the family members traveling with Marcus and Helena to Greece offered little of what we have learned to expect from their relatives in the way of extra heartburn for Falco, the spot-on observations about tourist groups and travel were great. I completely enjoyed ""See Delphi and Die""."
2,Not historical enough,"I like a lot of history with my fiction, and the Steven Saylor Gordianus the Finder series is much better at that."
4,A great piece of history - a must read for any WWII buff,"A great piece of little known WWII history about ""the few"" American fliers who flew for the British in the Battle of Britain. A solid book in every way. Alex Kershaw brings it all together by doing excellent research of the events as they unfolded. From the varied backgrounds of the individual fliers, the politics of the war, and the battle strategy of the Germans and British including quotes from Winston Churchill and Hermann Goering. Kershaw even throws in some vignettes of the German aces into the mix. The actual Battle of Britain is compelling and moving. As an aside, after I finished the book I watched the classic 1969 movie, ""Battle of Britain"". Even though some of the special effects are dated it is STILL a great movie and the facts and events of the book underpin the movie perfectly. There is nothing quite like the sight and sound of a Spitfire even on celluloid. A definite read for any WWII history buff!"
2,Hot Garbage,"I have at least 6 other dvd's with music videos and this is by far the worst. There are no menus on the dvd. It just starts playing. Trying to access a menu will send you back to the beginning of the dvd. Trying to skip a scene should skip to the next video. Sometimes it does, sometimes it skips to a random part of the same video. The video quality is poor, very cloudy. The selection of videos was the only saving point. I would not recommend purchasing this video."
5,GREAT shirt. GREAT price. GREAT service.,"Was so pleased with this shirt, right out of the box.Good quality and definitely NOT some cheap knockoff.Bought it for my son who loves it.And it looks like it will still be going strong when hefinally just outgrows it."
3,There are More Inclusive Nutrition Books Out There,"A fair amount of information, but not as inclusive as it could be. I liked Amanda Ursell's ""Healing Foods"" much better; it has more categories of detailed information in it."
2,Not what I expected,This book consists of small motifs and patterns. While the patterns are nice they are just black and white pictures. I wanted precut stencils which I could use to decorate. This book is for those who can use these patterns to perhaps make their own stencils. Not what I expected or wanted.
3,Not as good as the old days,"Have had mixed results with CO2, so I stopped at the local bike shop to get a full sized frame pump capable of inflating tires to 110+. The pump works fine, but the grip on the top tube isn't. Comes with a velcro stay to help keep it in place. The last one I bought never let go and needed no safety strap--but that was circa 1992. I bought the largest size in the Blackburn line and the top tube was in the recommended zone, but still sloppy. I'll likely just add foam tape to make for a tighter fit, but grippy this is not. Moral of the story--if you have a larger bike you may want to look for another brand. If attacked by a dog, no way will I be able to get the pump free in time to ward off the attack.At least it does pump to high pressures unlike those 1/2 sized units."
5,"Don't miss the ""Flowers of the West""","Although part of a trilogy, each novel stands alone and can be read by itself or in company with the others without missing anything. Heather struggles to make it as an artist in a man's world and finds true love where she least expects it. Don't miss ""Prim Rose"" and ""Sweet Laurel"" with her sisters' stories."
3,Not as heavy-duty as it could be,"My dad has a few of these long screwdrivers from eons ago and my husband wanted some just like them in order to be prepared for the rare occasion for which they are needed. They are hard to find!This screwdriver is sufficient but does not feel tough and durable. The handle is an average plastic and the shaft is thinner than I would expect for the length of the tool. Utimately I think it will do the job but this is certainly not of heirloom, father-to-son quality."
5,Swingin' singin'!,"I still can't find out this groovy Brasil chick s real name. Dusty Groove in Chicago has some of her stuff, otherwise it's only Brasil that may have copies. A pop singer in Brasil of the 60's on the Odeon label, Cladia is backed by swinging big bands and her jazz licks are phenomenal! Brit jazz singers like JaCKIE tRENT, cILLA bLACK, sHIRLEY Bassey come to mind. Ring a ding ding as Frank used to say! oops, CLAUDIA is her name."
5,Heartwarming and Inspirational !!!,This book was so inspirational ! It brought so much joy to each new day. I can't wait for for the woman's soul part II !
1,Area 51:America's Most Secret Base 1997 Documentary,"Saw it on NF, was very informative,yet at the same not as exciting as other material on the subject,overall it's ok but it is just interview after interview and commentary that can put you to sleep late at night on the sofa."
1,Waste of Money at ANY Price,Poorly manufactured cheap garbage. I wouldn't use these for free and am EXTREMELY sorry I purchased them.
2,Changing the sleeve.,"Frankly I am upset. I just purchased these and tried to change the foam on the ear buds. They do not come off. I followed the instructions and all I got was a cracking sound from the body of one of the buds. Sure they have great sound, but if you can not change the sleeve, what is the point of it comming with a nice little selection of ear pieces?"
5,Shure SE530,"the iem's just get better each time i put it in my ears...the soundstage is amazing, the bass,mids and treble sounds perfect, and compliment each other...the best iem's money can buy, i would recommmend it to any serious audiophile out there in the market looking for a world class iem's...shure se530 has blown me away!!"
5,"Fantastic, but hard to understand","It's cool. It's hard. It's nebulous. Like our life, like our death, like full Moon in the shadows and like alone man in the twilight.Try it. And your mind will derelict your head. Maybe for 1 hour, 1 day, 1 month, 1 millenia... I don't now. But this music is truly spell, fire spell, water spell... I want you to forget me, just listen. Bye."
2,not as much spooky as boring,"i had high hopes for this cd. the concept behind it, of unveiling a cd worth of rerecordings of rather eerie death-related pop material of the 60's & 70's by rose mcdowell and the only human being i know of with fetishes for charles manson & martin denny, boyd rice, is brilliant. the recordings themselves are well done, but something is missing in the translation. maybe its a little too predictable. maybe its because boyd cant sing to save his life. (goodbye boyd, its hard for your singing career to die...) but it all just comes off very bland. rose sings well, and the cover of dolly parton's down from dover is good. and thats about it. i'd like to recommend other boyd rice/non as an alternative, but if you know boyd, you'll laugh at me, and if you dont and buy the alternative, you will hate me. man, there is just no pleasing you..."
3,decent,"Book is decent shape with some writing in it. The writing is not disturbing. It is aged paperwise, but in sturdy shape. Arrived on time as promised."
4,Not for Amateurs!,"This is an excellent reference book and readable (mostly) as well. That said, if you're a homeowner just looking for a ""how-to"" on maybe additional zoning or adding a new loop, this is not the book for you. You could quite literally design a system for the most complex residence using this book IF you know the basics of plumbing and HVAC work and are pretty good at basic mathmatics. It is not so much a how-to as a what-to book, so bear that in mind."
2,Buy One Take Radio Sessions instead,"The previous reviewer appears to actually be reviewing a disc titled""One Take Radio Sessions"" which has all of the songs here plus Rudiger andEverybody Pays. Those two songs are not included on this disc. Buy One Take Radio Sessions and get more songs for less money. This one appears to be an EU release that shorted the European fans compared to what the US got."
2,Depressing!,"Shame on Ms. Park for perpetuating an Oklahoma stereotype. As a new resident of the state I've found the people to be warm and friendly. I have yet to meet anyone even remotely like the Moon family. Although amusing to start with, the novel became tedious. If you must read this book, check it out of the library."
5,Fabulous Summer Read,"A summer/beach book should be one that is easy put down and easy to pick up. It should have characters that intrique you and make you think of them when you aren't reading about them. It should cause you to assess your life, dreams, inner feelings. This book does all those things. It is ripe for a sequel or even a prequel to explore the characters more. Highly recommended."
1,Disappointing,"Good writing should flow naturally. This book feels contrived, the dialogue seems forced and the characters are caricatures of southern stereotypes -- all trying to manipulate an emotional reaction from the readers.Dig deeper, dear author. Truer words are inside you."
5,A Lovely Dose of Reality,"This book is a cure for all that ails you. Take one dose of reality, one-half dose of dysfunctional families, add a touch of love and the result is a prescription for happiness. Settle down with a few Moon Pies and enter a world where the characters are real, the setting is memorable, and the story is one that will touch the heart. It's not a book to read just once....you will want to know Darla and meet her family. It's a book that has a piece of all of us within its tale. Darla wants to leave Paradise, but I was happy to visit it, if only for a little while. The author is a gem...just like her book."
3,Not What I expected...,"Reading the back cover of this book, you don't realize fully what your getting into. This is a very dark and depressing look at a poor family in Paradise, Oklahoma. I thought this was going to be another light southern fiction book that I'd love, but instead I got a book filled with prostitution, sex, rape, murder, child and spousal abuse. I could only take this book in little doses, seeing as how it's such a downer.It took me a while to finish, the story was intersesting enough to make me want to know how it ended, but not enough for me to read it in one day. I don't know that I'd recommend this to anyone, it being such a dreary book and all...but if your interested in reading it, it's not a bad story, I just wasn't expecting it."
1,POOR QUALITY,"I purchased these glasses which are beautiful as long as you don't plan on using them. As soon as I started to hand wash these the red paint on the stems started to peel off and now I wouldn't use them for anything, I think that I will have to trash them now. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible Quality!,Just got these in the mail today and they are awful! The colors are faded and there are scratch and paint marks on the glasses. But the worst part is the rim of the glass is rough! It is like they cut the glass and it is not smooth where you would drink from. I am going to return them and would not recommend them at all!
3,College course requirement for my son.,My son said this was difficult to get through. Not his kind of preferred reading at 19 but who knows...
2,Its NOT a glass,"Upon its arrival, I discovered that while it is 16 oz, and helpfully printed with measurements and recipes, it is not a glass. It is plastic. I would have liked a warning about its petroleum-based nature."
5,New Orleans Playground,"My three and two year old love this CD...great music, rich with the sounds of a magical city."
1,A complete disaster,I could use this product as the DVI plug did not fit on the DVI outlet of my computer.AVOID!!!
3,Cardboard &#65533; Smardboard This stuff is fun and fast Paced.,"This is book 3 of the series that became a TV show for a short time. If you read and enjoyed the first 2 (Tekwar and Tek Lords) you will probably like this one also. This is as formulaic as a hit TV series, but you gotta love Jake and his friends as written by Shatner and his friends.You might laugh about the plot idea for restoring the English monarchy, but I work with a salesman once who had a PHD in medieval history who felt the world would be better off under a single monarchy. He was serious. Votes straight dem to.Anyway, I think Plots are like eating a food preparation for the first time. I don't mind trying it as it was intended to be eaten. A plot should be allowed to be developed, and only if it trips all over itself do I conclude that it was stupid in the context of the story being told. Of course the plot is stupid. That is why it must be stopped."
5,Fabulous Book on Health,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in their good health.My own very old copy is underlined in pencil, it is so special....It is spiritually written and I bought it for my chiropractor. It was writtenmany years ago but quite informative and prevalent today. They knewsomething about healing when they wrote this book...It is a fabulous book....go get it!"
3,Family room for some,"I was expecting Large Print so my husband could read it. He enjoyed some of the stories read to him. But alittle too preachy for some. I donated it to the ""Family Room"" here at the hospital."
4,Return With Us Now to Those Thrilling Days of Yesteryear...,"Good book, perhaps a great book.Lots of good, warm stories and a few tales of life as we once knew it--whether it was really that way or not. Life as we remembered it and want it to be again.Philip Gulley's a good writer and a good story teller, good, heartwarming stories and tales, tale and stories with a moral, like television used to be. (Hence the reference to the Lone Ranger)Paul Harvey, Jr. writes in the introduction: ""...I remember how what he said made me feel: as thorugh I were drawn into a world for which I longed, and yet which I believed was now inaccessible in these turbulent high-tech times. The tale he (Gulley) unveiled was tender and humorous, and the characters who populated it--real people whom the young pastor had known--came vividly to life...""For the ""rest of the story,"" you will have to get the book. It's a good one, well worth the read and the modest cost."
1,terrible,"would not recommend this product at all. i was hoping to use this for my wedding, but i didn't want to use it out of the box, so i put it in the dish washer to clean. when i took it out, the product was completely ruined (completely rusted - it looked like it was a relic from the 20s). did not even get to use it, instead threw it away and went to a store nearby and got comparable candy scoopers for way cheaper."
4,just the right size,this was a gift for my daughter in law; she said it fit the opening for the one gallon canister perfectly
1,The damned label is a major drawback,"It's a decent scoop for cheap, but there's a label on it. If you scrub it with one of the yellow/green scrub sponges, the label glue won't come off at all. If you use goof-off, or some other petrochemical solvent, the glue will come off, but there's a discoloration on the scoop that is permanent. And you have to use a chemical solvent on a food serving product.Obviously this company pays no attention to either testing their products or listening to reviews on the online websites.I don't know how much you're saving, but ask yourself if breaking out the solvent is worth the savings."
2,Too old....,This book was written in the 50's about the future (our time). So it is a bit of an odd read.
3,Great headphones,"The package was perfect, shipped in time and item in perfect shape. Headphones are great, nice sound and mono function very practical for people with hearing disabilities."
2,Poor quality,"I guess you get what you pay for... But I expected a tad more quality. My two year old is of average weight and height for his age yet barely fits in the costume...too snug. Also, the head doesn't sit up straight on his head like the picture. Overall, I would not recommend purchasing this costume."
1,So dissapointed - such a poor tool Avoid CPO Bosch!,"Be careful, This is NOT an impact driver but only a screw gun. To make matters worse, the trigger has a very annoying lag in response - pull the trigger and 1/2 a second later the drill begins to turn but slow at first then revs up. I drove a couple screws before chucking it aside only to list it on Ebay a couple days later. CPO Bosch had a totally ridiculous return policy, they will only accept returns if the item is unused so if you buy from them and wish to return, you must lie and say the item is used. I own the 10.4 impact driver which is very nice but this is a mistake in design. there are many better products which will do a much better job than this item. Beware!!"
3,Buyer beware,"This is a okay product and does a okay job of cleaning. However when I opened it and tried to use it the disc wouldn't move. So I took it apart and examined it and found that the gear from the motor wasn't able to reach the other gears. I was able to fix it, but it may be better to look for a better made product."
2,Too Vinegary for me. Going back to the original Franks RH + Butter recipe from Buffalo,"Take a look at the ingredients list from the regular sauce vs the ingredients list from the wings sauce. You will note vinegar jumped from #2 to the #1 ingredient. In my opinion the wings sauce is too vinegary. I'm going back tot he original buffalo recipe, Franks RH + Butter. 3 parts Franks to 2 parts butter is the original, alter to your desired level of zing."
4,Power Strip,"Are you tired of hunting for that electrical outlet when your laptop battery is on its last bar? This Kensington power strip is what you need.Pros- 6 outlets, illuminated power switch, protection indicator (green LED), and best of all there is a 15ft cord which allows extended range at the airports or the coffee shops.Cons- None at this timeThis review is based on a 60 day use."
1,Lost in the mail,"This item was mailed on October 16, 2007, and the tracking number revealed that it was sent to a postal processing center in Kansas City, as it was not possible to deliver or to return to the sender. I have tried talking to the USPS, but have fallen into a postal black hole. Can you help me with this?? Thank you."
3,Meh,"These are nice low-profile running shoes but not very sturdy and they get soaked very easily on damp/soggy terrain. They also look way too masculine on me. I really wanted to like them more based on how awesome their rock climbing shoes are, but maybe that will happen with future models. Also, I pronate too much so these shoes don't really give me enough support. I am a big fan of the higher end Asics trail runners and sometimes the Mizuno (in warmer weather and for more basic trails)."
3,pretty if it arrives in one piece,"I ordered two, but when they arrived, one was missing a stone and had broken teeth. I needed them for my wedding that weekend. So, I could only wear the one. Longhairgirl did not offer to refund my money for the broken hair clip, but just sent me another. However, the replacement arrived after the wedding and so now I'll probably never wear it. If not broken, they are very pretty, but too fancy for everyday wear."
5,Best stuff out there,"I've been using this since I was twelve...I'm 24 now and I haven't found anything that does as well. Best thing about it, it makes my hair soft and shiny and it smells good. I've learned to put just the right amount so that it's not too heavy and I only need a little bit. One container usually lasts me all year. It's the only thing that has kept my hair healthy through all what I have done to it. Dyeing, straightening ect. I've always gotten compliments on my hair. It's curly and I never knew what to do with it until one day a friend gave me some of hers. Ever since then I have been hooked. The only thing about it is that I can only find it online I can't seem to find a local store that sells it anymore. I used to find it at Walmart or a Fred's. But since it lasts for a long time for me it's not that bad since I only have to order it once a year."
5,"Great book, loved the applications portion","The book's best part is the applications part. They use real life applications for the theory in a way that applies to simple, everyday problems. The seller was great and got me the book quickly without mixing the ISBN up like other sellers sometimes do."
3,This is an OK game.,"Graphics 7.5/10 Graphics are good, but, they are not in true 3D, but I will at least accept the way the graphics are due to the fact that the system is not powerful enough to generate true 3D graphics.Gameplay 5/10 What is the point of this? Where is the real action? You just defeat robots, collect rings, defeat Robotnik, give it a break.Plot 6/10 Ok plot. Robotnik turned all the Flickes into robots, very basic plot.Music 8/10 Very good soundtrack.Sound 7/10 Good sound. Same effects as the other games, but I will accept it.Overall: 6.8/10 It is ok, but I will reccommend Sonic 1, 2, 3 and the Sonic Adventure series, but not this game."
1,Catastrophe,"The DI-604 that I purchased ended up to be a nightmare. All it did was destroy the internet connection so it could not be used by any computer. We ended up having to have CableOne reset our account. Even then, we could not get the DI-604 to work."
1,AOL for Broadband user AVOID this product!,"In the world of liars, there use to be liars, damn liars and statistics. Now add on Computer sales people and harware manufactures to the list. I recently acquired a AOL for Broadband account and would like to add a network so my desktop and laptop can use the same connection and share printers. I purchased this modem with the assurance that is compatible with AOL! NOT!!!! After 3 three attempts at D-links technical support hotline--I got three different solutions, only one of which had the router acting as a router! For the public's sake, do not tell people you support a product only to be told after hours invested into installing it that it does not. I am returning the product and will no longer support d-link with my money--I will invest with other companies who chose to be HONEST when representing their products"
1,Lasted about a year,This router worked fine for about 12 months and now is unreliable. It keeps dropping the links. One path will work fine while another is out. The links go up and down. When the router is removed the link works fine so it is nothing else in the network causing the problem.
1,Arrived defective.,The product arrived defective. Customer support was not very helpful.I was trying to use this for two Mac G5s and an XBOX 360.
2,Good for surfing..But....,"Great for surfing, but firmware must be flashed because they all ship with outdated firmware.Also if you want to use a webcam etc, forget it.. Not even using the DMZ is going to save you.I dont know what to buy now, as the Linksys looks like it is not very reliable either.."
5,"Excellent product, excellent support.","Since I got this router, I've been trying to set up my computer as an FTP server during the day. I had no luck, until last night. Of course, I had to break it to make it work(Note for ATT Broadband users: don't disable DHCP). So, after tech support with ISP, I called D-Link. The rep was very helpful. He got me connected again, and then helped me set up my router and machine so it could act as an FTP server. Everything works perfectly now, and I am very satisfied."
3,Decent,"Basic functionality is fine, but mine doesn’t obey any of the “custom” firewall rules I’ve given it. Port forwarding is fine when set up through it’s interface, but I have not yet been able to get any user-created rules to actually be implemented. It’s rather frustrating to see your rule sitting there doing nothing despite being identical to the one the firmware generates. And yes, the “enabled” box is checked and the schedule set to “always”."
1,"Overheats, then fails","I have had two DLink routers and both have died from overheating. I use my router every day, about 3-5 hours altogether, only doing normal web surfing and minimal to moderate downloading. The first router completely failed, had lasted about 2 years so I thought it had a good run. Bought another Dlink, because hey they *are* cheap. It's been a little over a year and the thing is overheating just like the first one. You can feel the heat just rising off the cheap plastic box. It works intermittenly and will probably fail completely soon. Besides spending money twice on something that died so easily, I had ALWAYS had trouble with the advanced features such as opening up ports and even using the DMZ feature. I could never get my router to open up correctly to outside traffic. I'm going to go with a Linksys, hoping it will last me a little longer and will perform more reliably."
1,"Sluggish, erratic connects","It is a cheap residential gateway and it behaves like one. It has the wierd behaviour of dropping packets, sluggish transfers. Using a remote terminal app through the router like ssh was a nightmare. Some sites would time out while connecting. I did upgrade the firmware - but in vain.I suspected my roadrunner uplink at first, but then i connected my computer directly to the cable modem and the connection behaved MUCH better. Over a period of 5 minutes, a ping dropped only 2% of the packets when connected directly to the cable modem, vs 30% when connected via the router. The problems started to appear once i tried to change some settings (NTP server, domain name etc). But I could not reset to defaults by using the button at the back !Some computer links would just go down and the router would show a steady blinking activity. My laptop's internal network port would drop the physical link to this srouter, but work fine with my other DI-704.Stay away from this cheap stuff."
1,poor,"sole near toe has already pulled apart, leather stich is broken. I have never had a Mootsies Shoe and probably will never buy this name brand again. I have always worn Naturalizer shoes. They last for 5-6 yrs. Really disappointed in this product. Fast delivery, however."
5,Extremely comfortable shoe! (Loafer).,This is an outstanding loafer. It looks nice and easy to slip on and off especially when traveling. Its so comfortable that they feel like your wearing slippers!Also my order came quickly and am very happy with my purchase from amazon.com. I love the free shipping amazon has on many products.
2,Not his best book,He went on a wild goose chase to some tropical island. Let me just say that he didn't find much. I suggest you skip this book.
2,concise and often wrong,"Very dense, thorough review, fits into lab coat. Unfortuantely the descriptions leave you with little clue about dx or tx for different diseases, just word assosications. Also, if you read something fuller, the info in here just seems wrong. Good for review, if you read something else, but then in that case why read this at all?"
3,More of the same,"Not a big change from previous editions, somewhat frustrating to buy almost the same book again, do not recommend unless you dont own the previous editions"
3,not the strongest in the series,"These ""Soul Hits of the 70s"" compilations from Rhino were almost all wonderful, packed with great songs that bring back great memories of that weird and wonderful decade. For my tastes, however, this is one of the weakest volumes in the series, highlighting late 70s songs that were more disco than soul. Some wonderful tunes from artists like the O'Jays, Raydio (Ray Parker's band), and Ashford & Simpson, but some mediocre tracks that don't click for me from the likes of Peter Brown, Bell and James, and GQ. No wonder you don't remember them, right? By no means is this awful --- songs by Cheryl Lynn and McFadden & Whitehead, for example, still sound fun and will bring a smile to your face, if not a dance to your step --- but it's not the prime, classic soul that defined the 70s."
1,p funk reject,This live joint is pure garbage! Don't waste your time or money ! The songs sound nothing like the original and seem amateurish! They sound like they faking the funk! The band doesn't sound good at all.a lot of the joints r cut.and it seems their all to funked up! Where r the brides and parlett? Wow George u really p stunk this 1
3,Positive Points from Seymour A. Papert's Generation Gap book,"Some of the most important things that I as an educator and parent took away from this book was the involvement of both the parents and teacher in the education of their children. My asessment of the book was that he uses the computer to increase the communication of all family members and show the uses of the computer. The one thing that stayed with me the most was the saying ""Not why the computer but how the computer"". That means to think of ways to include the computer in your everyday life. This is a book that all educators should have and encourage their students parents to get."
3,.,"This is a disc of Merzbow remixes and a couple of brief, traditional Merzbow tracks. The remixes are generally minimal in nature, and, for the most part, are fairly interesting. Autechre actually creates techno out of their Merzbow selection, and this was the thing I was most looking forward too -- but the result isn't really all that big of a deal. It just sounds like a mediocre Autechre track, which isn't really all that bad a thing, but it also goes on for 4-5 minutes too long. It's actually one of my least favorite tracks on the disc. O' Rourke's is interesting at first but then gets tedious. The three tracks in the middle (Panasonic and two people I've never heard of) are the highlight -- ""Micromedley"" is particularly interesting. The two Merzbow tracks are typical Merzbow, which is fine, but it feels like they're there just for the hell of it. Still, although this disc isn't all it could've been and more, it's still generally interesting, and worthwhile if you're a Merzbow fan."
3,Way hotter Bikini girls DVD ..,"Ok, forget the little girls from GGW- these other chicks are super hot!!! You've gotta get ""Wild Girls Thailand"" DVD- hot Asian beauties taking off their bikinis on this awesome beach. Wish I could go pick one of them up, man! Wow!!!"
5,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,This pump was at the high end of the price range and my expectations were also high. I was not disappointed. This is a quality device which does extreemly well exactly what it was designed for. This is a tool for one who appreciates a well designed and well made item for it's own inherent quality as as well as its function. You do get what you pay for.
1,Pump no good!,"Thought I'd splurge and buy a decent pump. Bought this one and took it home. First use: very hard to pump, like the hose was plugged. Gauge shot up to max psi and settle down after about 2 minutes to show the pressure in the tire. You mean it's going to take me a half hour to fill my tire? Not likely. It's headed back to the shop. I'm not planning on fooling around with the warranty. Forget it!"
1,Not a good choice,"I ordered this to use at our cabin. When it arrived the box looked perfect...no dents or rips, etc. The unit was sold as ""new"", however when we removed it from the package it was apparent that someone had damaged it and repackaged it as new. It doesnt work. Very disappointing. Would not order an appliance from Amazon again."
1,Disappointment...should've spent the extra money.,"I really wish I read the reviews for this product. I thought, really, how bad could headphones be? And when I bought them a week ago they were like 8 bucks, now for some reason they're 12. I assure you, it's not worth it.The retractable cord is absolutely flimsy, and if you dont pull both ends it gets all silly. And I really wanted something that I could retract and toss in my bag instead of having to wrap up the cord, but it wont retract past the useless clip on the end enough to make this what I wanted it to be.The earbuds are too big, unless you take off the pads, but then they're just uncomfortable.Also, there's only a few stops that the retractable cords will stop at. So chances are you'll get too much wire or not enough and unable to find a happy medium.Honestly, you'd be better off getting a pair of skull candy earbuds and taking the extra effort to wrap up the cord. They're much better quality."
2,Kinda frustrating..,"I had mixed this dye with the virgin snow toner and the color result was kinda this cool purple-ish gray color and I enjoyed it, in spite of the taunts thrown at me by the elders that they ""earned"" their grays lol. This product still disappointed me though, as it didn't last very long and on manic panic's website they make it sound like you only have to redye it every so often. I will most likely not buy this again, nor recommend this to a friend."
3,"~it is useful .it help me goodi like it , it look not bad. ~~~ ~ ~ ~",it is useful .it help me goodit look not bad.but the color is not good~~~ ~ ~ ~
2,Fades QUICKLY,"I used this product for some highlights, and was expecting it to stay for several weeks. Not true... It lasted maybe 2 days before it faded into an ugly lavender shade. It was completely out by 5 days. Really dissappointing! So, if you never wash your hair, I guess it'd work. But for me, I'll just have to find a more permanent dye."
2,Fades too quickly.,"I've used manic panic in my hair before (vampire red), but this color just seemed to fade to white every time I showered. The red had stayed in for weeks, maybe it was just the amplified version that last a lot longer. But this purple can't compare. Really really disappointing. :("
3,"Nice soundtrack, but....","Don't purchase it if you're expecting the strongest music featured in Chungking Express. It does not have, surprisingly, the following tracks:* California Dreamin' (The Mamas & the Papas)* Things in Life (Dennis Brown)* What a Difference a Day Makes (Dianah Washington)I have no idea why...."
5,Spetacular interpretation,"This music CD is simply a masterpiece, which brings together an spectacular exemplar of the medieval christian music (Llibre Vermell de Montserrat) with the wonderful interpretation of Jordi Savall's Hespèrion XX ensemble."
5,really enjoy this work-out,This is my first purchase of Ellen's and I really like her style of teaching. I feel it's a good workout as I'm new to using hand weights. The moves are challenging and you feel results the first time you do these exercises. I like the variety and how she builds on each exercise. Highly recommend.
3,"Great for beginners, not-so-much for the advanced exerciser","I bought this video with high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews. I was really disappointed. The video is well-made and great for the beginning exerciser, but I did not find it challenging at all and hardly broke a sweat except briefly during the bootcamp segment. I usually workout with either Billy Blanks' Get Ripped Advanced Tae Bo series or by taking kickboxing classes at the gym. Compared to these, this video simply doesn't cut it and is much too slow-paced for the advanced level exerciser."
4,FUUUUUNNNY,"This DVD is hilarious. I think being a Latino helps A LOT with much of the comedy, but anyone can appreciate his humor.I would recommend it!"
3,"Great bits, but lose the swearing","George has some great comedy bits here, but the swearing is over the top from my point of view. Would moms hit their kids and call them SOBs? He could take out about 20-25 instances of unnecessary swearing and have a PG-13 DVD that the whole family could watch."
5,Confused between the release of this game and regular mk3,"Great game! Im glad they put the ninjas in this game scorpion, reptile and subzero rule! UMK3 is nearly as good as MK Trilogy!"
2,This isnt the plastikman I once knew,"I myself am a big fan of plastikman (aka Richie Hawtin)but this effort seemed to be lacking in depth,seems like he isnt trying anymore . If anything buy this cd for the art work its a sheet of blotter paper ,hence SHEET ONE."
4,I stumbled upon this CD and havn't been able to put it down.,"After a giving a dumbfounded look when asked If I had ever heard this CD, I was soon indulging my senses in the awesome beats Ritchie Hawtin was serving up... I was amazed that the tracks flowed so smoothly and took my senses for a ride inside the synthesized world of PLASTIKMAN. I reccommend this CD to everyone I know and I think everyone should experience the world of PLASTIKMAN. Check out the clips... they're not as good as the whole CD but, It's a start."
5,My 3-year-old loves it!,"This is such a great way to teach your children nursery rhymes. My daughter has been listening to these songs and rhymes on CD for about a year now and absolutely loves seeing them acted out here. It may not be the greatest picture job ever (you can see clearly that the background is fake and the actors aren't really there), but it doesn't take away from the experience. Very worth adding to your child's collection!"
3,A little thin,This towel is beautiful and hasn't faded over time. The only problem I have with it is that it is pretty thin. I like really thick beach towels and this one is not. So if you want a towel that looks cool or are a huge FSU fan then go ahead and get it. If you are looking for a thick towel that can be used several times without drying over the course of a pool or beach visit then this isn't it.
2,What a Whiner!,"""Rewrites"" was better than this effort because Neil Simon shared more insights into his creative process than this volume. In ""The Play Goes On,"" he concentrates on whining over the breakup of his serial marriages -- while asking us to believe that nobody was ever responsible for his string of divorces. His explanation? That there's some kind of genetic marker that determines how long people stay married. PLEASE!Simon also spends a good deal of time asking us to believe other whoppers; that his plays are not all autobiographical (I guess this is true... most -- but not all -- of his plays are that way); and that he has no memory of writing most of his plays, that they just came out of him in some kind of auto-pilot-like trance.Anyone wanting to learn about Simon and his creative process is better off studying his plays."
5,A League Of Its Own,"Vehemence is not just another Suffocation clone. This band tends to be more melodic while adding brutal death vocals to their music. Songs like ""The Last Fantasy of Christ"" and ""Fantasy From Pain"" prove this off. This is something original here. Other songs like ""God Was Created"" may be faster, but still melodic as well. I highly recommend this. Buy this NOW.And to the guy below, did you listen to the CD? Or did you just make a dumb assumption saying that this was a Cannibal Corpse ripoff band and decided to type some mumbo jumbo to piss us off? Well, sir, you don't know sh*t about music and seriously need to ""not judge a book by its cover"" and keep your mouth shut."
3,??? Not too sure!!!!!,"I did get the first set a few years back and enjoyed them! This one dissapoints first: No Subtitles!!!!Two: Stories are VERY HARD to follow, kind of mixed up even!! I don't know, maybe its me being used to all the American Crime dramas, but I also watch ALL the Brit detective stories and procedurals! Sure the stories are gritty and dark, but still confusing to watch! Still on the fence about getting set 3!!!!Never feel that way with Midsomer, Poirot, Marple, and all the CSI's, Castle, Mentalist, The Closer, you name it I've got it!!!! Oh well!"
2,Not Worth getting,I do not recommed this item. Acorn media is too cheap to put sub titles and the film is hard to understand.
