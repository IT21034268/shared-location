4,Good Pedometer,"Great features! Probably the best pedometer out there for the money. The only reason I give 4 vice 5 stars, is that I think the one I bought for my mom (same brand and model) is slightly more accurate. A great way to track your fitness overall!"
1,"Worked great for 3 months, then nothing",Used carefully by my wife on and off for 3 months. Then nothing. New battery didn't help.
2,Not Happy,"I have not been able to use yet, because it does not come with a battery.......To bad they didn't think a head.."
5,Best peodmeter I have ever tried.,I love this pedometer. I make it a point now to clip it to whatever pants I am wearing that day. It is a great insentive to keep moving. I love the fact that it keeps track of what I have done(steps I've taken) over several days. I'm finding myself marching in place during TV commercials just to rev up my steps when I haven't reached my goal.
5,PEDOMETER,I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND DOES EXACTLY AS IT WAS ADVERTISED
4,Digital pedometer is the best,I really like the pedometer. The only thing I have had happen a few times is that the reset button gets bumped and I lose my steps for the day without realizing it. Being able to lock the buttons would be a nice feature. Overall it is great!
4,Exactly what I was looking for...,"This pedometer was exactly what I was looking for. I like that it has the 7 day memory so I can go back and check my progress. It really motivates you when you see how far you have walked (or haven't walked) in a day. I like that it can go in any pocket on your shirt or pants (even upside down) and it works.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I don't like the clip that attaches to it to wear it on your waist band. It is a little wide, so if it is attached to your waist it catches on everything. It came off a couple times when it was caught on something, so I rarely use the clip.One other thing, I accidently washed it (OOPS!)and it still worked! Really great little pedometer!"
5,Great Pedometer,"I have owned a few Pedometers and this one works the best.I just put it in my pocket and it works just great.It comes with a clip so I have worn it on my side before nut I prefer it in my pocket.I wish I could turn it off to save on battery when not in use, but that is the only feature it doesn't have that I would desire.I highly recommend this Pedometer!"
4,great little machine,"This pedometer is terrific. It took virtually no set up, so it was easy to get started. It records your steps, as it should, along with aerobic steps and other things. As advertised, you have options as to where/how to carry it. If you wear waistbands, belts, and pockets, you've got it made in the shade. But if you lean toward little summer dresses, no problem. It is small enough to slip into your bra & it works just fine there. I've even worn it inside the top of a ballet leotard. Convenient & it works. What more can you ask?"
5,The best of the bunch,"I've had at least five other brands/models of pedometers, and this one has been the best by far. Its accuracy is amazing and the clip-on strap has proved very helpful.The only complaint I have is with Omron's website. The clip on the strap broke recently, and finding a replacement has been difficult and bizarre. Omron's website says to contact two US vendors for replacement parts; both vendors emailed me and said they don't carry replacement parts. I called Omron directly and guess what? They said, contact the vendors! I finally got ahold of customer service at Omron and after a loong time on hold explained the problem and they are sending me a new strap. Despite the problems with their website, I would still recommend this pedometer over anything else on the market."
4,Very Good Pedometer,This pedometer is the best. I love it. But it stopped working on me after a few weeks of use. Not sure why that happened. I wrote the company and they said they would replace it. So it's all good. I just need to get around to doing that.
4,pocket pedometer,It doesn't seem to work as well in the pockets of women's clothing as it does in mens---possibly due to womens pockets are not as deep and does not catch the movement action as well as those in men's going lower on the leg.
5,Excellent pedometer,"This pedometer is excellent if you like to see if you are improving from week to week. It has a memory feature that keeps the previous weeks steps miles etc so you can go back and verify if you are staying the same, progressing or lagging behind. The best pedometer I have used. It is the most accurate step counter I have used. I would highly recommend this pedometer to anyone."
3,Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium,"I was very excited to get this product...it keeps steps good....but the thing that I hate about it (and the reason I went back to using my old one) is because the way this product is designed as far as the buttons on the front...too sensitive and will reset easily..like bending over to tie your shoe or bumping your arm against it while walking or leaning against something. Its very frustrating to be trying to get my 12,000 steps in during the day only to have the thing resetting itself. I went back to my $2.99 one I got at a discount store...it keeps steps as well as the Orion and I NEVER have to worry about it resetting itself."
5,"Excellent Product, Convenient and Keeps you on track.","Very convenient and easy to use Product. The best features I like about this are* 7 Day History, helps me track my progress everyday.* Calorie counter, aerobic steps,Time on the display and miles on the display are a plus.* 2 Clips make sure I don't drop it and sits snuggly on my belt.I would recommend this product to anybody ready to get set moving.Few extra dollars spent are well worth."
5,Terrific Pedometer,"I selected this pedometer after being disappointed by several other cheap pedometers that did not work. I chose this one because I have a blood pressure machine made by the same company that is very accurate. I have been extremely pleased by the accuracy and reliability of this pedometer. I also like how it attaches to my clothing and has a security strap. It also reads well in a pocket or a purse which is good for certain applications.It keeps a seven day memory which is wonderful.The mileage,steps, aerobic steps and calorie count are the items I wanted to monitor.The read-out is very clear and I like the fact that I do not have to flip anything open to be able to read this one. This machine is terrific and very easy to work.Several of my friends have asked me to purchase the same pedometer for them."
5,This pedometer rocks!,Extremely accurate step count which converts to miles and the best part is that it does not need to worn on a belt clip. Works just as well in a pocket or handbag!
5,works great!,Easy to use and as accurate as any pedometer I've tried (I've got four). Way better than its cheaper Omron cousin. Durable and secure double clipping mechanism.
2,Not accurate counting!,"It came highly recommended and I wanted to figure out how many steps I was taking daily. I would have had more accurate numbers if I counted in my head! There are times it doesn't count any steps at all and then there are times when like riding in the car, it says I have taken 2000 steps. NOT HAPPY!!! It is too finicky and I would not recommended to anyone! I gave it 2 stars because if you are walking in a straight line for a ways the numbers are accurate but otherwise it is junk."
5,Won't walk without it!,"This is the BEST pedometer I've ever had. In the past, I'd tried several others and for one reason or another, they just didn't work out. One thing that may seem inconsequential, but has turned out to be very important, is the fact you are able to attach this pedometer to your pants! There is no risk of it falling off and getting ruined or lost. All in all, a GREAT product for a very reasonable price."
5,Pedometer,"From the moment I get up, until the last moment of the day, I wear my pedometer. One feature that I particularly like is the memory function because I am able to keep a daily log to the final step. I have had other pedometers, but this one has been the absolute most reliable."
5,Nice,"This pedometer has worked great for me. It seems to keep great track of every step. It also keeps track of distance, calories, aerobic steps and duration, and it keeps memory of the last 7 days. It is also very durable; it went through the wash still attached to my pants and came back to life. Over all, I am very pleased."
5,This is the flagship of pedometers,"I have tried about 10 different pedometers and this is the only one that I have tested that is shockingly accurate. You take 20 steps and it says you took 20 steps. Slick design. It has a aerobic step section as well. Again extremely accurate here as well. I get on the treadmill for 30 minutes and when I get off it, it says you have spent 30 minutes of aerobic activity. WOW!"
3,Nothing crazy...,Good standard pedometer. I've never had one before but this one definitely gets the job done. Good product.
4,Does the Job,"I ordered the Omron HJ-112 to replace my existing pedometer that only counted steps. I have only had it for a week but so far I am pleased with it. It was easy to set it up and it is accurate. It tracks distance, number of steps, calories burned and aerobic activity. The display is easy to read too. I only gave it 4 stars because the belt clip is weak. The clip falls off if I bend down, depending on what pants or shorts I'm wearing. It does have a safety strap to prevent the pedometer from falling to the ground if the belt clip comes loose. It definitely does the job."
5,Know how much you move,"Love this pedometer. The strap is a safeguard for when the clip slips off your waistband. Had one before w/out a strap and lost it in the grass. This even tracks your steps while in your purse. Anyone wanting to know how active they are would benefit from this. One hour in the gym and the rest of the day sitting doesn't measure up. Shooting for the 10,000 steps a day can encourage you to take an extra walk, park far away and take those stairs. You can also see how many steps were ""aerobic"" versus ""strolling"" and keeps track of your daily step count for the past week. A great tool!"
4,Great Meter,I just got this meter about a month ago and it did every thing they said it would. Very happy with this one. My Dr. said spend a little more and this is one I recommend. I like that It shows how many calories I burn and most of all the steps I need to get for my dailey walks.
4,If you walk you need one of these,This is my second HJ112 pedometer. I am very hard on them as I do a lot of work outdoors with saws and brush cutters. My only problem with the unit is that it has a tendency to unclip from my belt if it gets hit. The reason I had to replace the last one was that it came unclipped and I lost the back and battery. The information the pedometer gives is really great and I record it all in a spreadsheet to see how I am doing. I have had other pedometers but none worked as well as this one. I would say that you have to take the time to set it up correctly. If you do that the results will amaze you.
5,Easy pedometer,"I love my pedometer - I wear it everywhere. Easy to use, program, and read. Even keeps track of steps for 7 days!"
5,Easy To Use Pedometer,I purchased several different pedometers to try out before I launch a corporate walking program and this one by far is superior. It is the easiest to set up and very simple to use/read.
5,I love my pedometer,"I love my Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer. It's great! I can track my steps, aerobic steps, calories used, mileage and the time. Plus I can compare the number of steps I took over the past week to see my progress. I highly recommend getting the model with the safety leash. The pedometer can easily slip off a waist band and with the leash it won't hit the ground or get lost.Omron Hj-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer with Safety Leash for Pedometer (1) Unit. Helps Save Pedometers From Loss While Running or Walking or Doing Exercise"
4,walk a mile in my shoes,"Myself and a fellow nurse decided we needed to know how much we walked every day. She purchased hers at a dept. store for twice as much as I paid for this one. And the bonus is, this one is SO easy to use and read. The extra clip attached to the holder is also a wonderful feature. It has saved me from losing the pedometer a few times."
3,Battery died within 6-7 months,"Like the pedometer. This one is for my wife. Bought in May 2011, but the battery died too soon, Dec. 2011."
5,Omron Pedometer HJ-112,"I have a few digital pedometers which do not work for me. They all miss steps - perhaps I walk too smoothly. This one works even if it is in my pocket. I have counted nearly 1,000 steps on the first trip and the pedomter and I were within 0.5%. I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong! I think it is as good as you will find."
4,Excellent Pedometer,"I've been using this pedometer for over a week. I am a very competitive person and am trying to ""beat"" my previous day's steps. This pedometer fits in my pocket securely, clips to my waist snugly, and I even wear it on my boot top or shoe when I don't want the bulge on my waistline. I love the different features such as calories burned, aerobic steps taken, and most importantly showing me the current time!There are two things I dislike however (hence 4-stars not 5): 1)If I put this in my pocket on tighter fitting clothing or under a spandex-like workout tank, it will not count steps well; 2)It has some kind of time delay so it doesn't accurately count some of my aerobic steps - latin dancing especially.Overall I recommend this to anyone looking for a new or first pedometer. My husband even teases me because I wear it all day every day."
5,Fun Device,"100% satisfied. I am a runner and wanted to know how many additional walking miles I did daily. As was indicated on the OMRON, I am logging in 3-4 miles daily in my classroom teachings and other non-running activites. But, this is what impressed me the most...by mistake, I left the device in my pocket and it made a complete cycle through the washing machine and an hour in the dryer. When I retrieved the pedometer the only function that operated was the Time. I removed the 4 basic screws, disassembled the main body from the chassis and allowed the device to air overnight. Having little hope, I made plans to order a new unit the following day. Crazily, when I reassembled the unit the next day the unit worked perfectly. This pedometer is a fun device and I recommend it highly."
4,Excellent pedometer,"I've had this pedometer for over a month and I love it. It is quiet, secures by the clip (which has already saved me from losing it over 5x), accurate and easy to use. I'm not a natural gadget person, and yet it was easy to figure out even before checking the directions. Most importantly it is encouraging me to move more. I thought I was active at work, but I walk alot less steps than I thought. Hmm, no wonder I wasn't losing weight- not nearly as active as I thought I was!"
4,Omron Digital Pedometer,"Easy to set, clips to pocket or belt or in your pocket. Needs to be reset every seven days."
5,Omron Pedometer,I love this pedometer- it's easy to use and the most accurate one I've ever had. I highly recommend it!
3,Almost very good,"I checked the rating on various pedometers before I purchased. This one had a very good rating. Problems I have had with it are:1. Very uncomfortable attached to waistband because it is so tall. It is fine to put in my pocket, but I don't always have pockets. It will come out of the holder when attached to waistband.2. It will reset itself just by being bumped??? Also, the 2 readings for steps are misleading - did I walk a total of the 2 step readings? - is the step reading on the #2 register also included in the step register #1?3. Being in my pocket, I am not sure how accurate the reading is. I need to test it."
3,"Good product, but not as useful as I would want","I needed a pedometer that measured all my steps, not just those when I was walking as exercise at a measured pace so this is not useful or used nearly as much as it could be. Most of my walking is just life walking, not the minutes set aside for cardio-vascular exercise, and that was what I wanted to measure. This doesn't do it."
1,Fails to meet claim,"The item shipped promptly from the firm. It requires some minor measuring of step width for calorie calculation which makes sense. I have yet to see if the measurement is accurate as the brand new item failed to turn itself off and there is no off button! The manual claims if no button is pressed that it will turn itself off within 5 minutes. However, it stayed on no matter what I did. This means I have to reinsert the battery every time and the thread on the tiny screw will wear out. It also means I have to reprogram every time, thus losing the data from the 7 day calendar. This pedometer because of the battery bug is worthless!!! I called the 800 number but no fix was offered."
5,Great Product!!,"Wow, what a great product. It really works and is very accurate. Much better than the $10 & $14 Sportline 330's I had before! Well worth every penny!"
5,Good service + timely shipping,Item was shipping and received within the timeframe specified. The item that was ordered was what I received. It was well packaged and documented. I am very pleased with the service I received. Wil definitely use this service/seller again.
4,Omron HJ-112,Easy to set up and use. Gives accurate readings and I like the storage feature. I would recommend this pedometer
1,"if you change the features, change the model number","I have ordered several Omron HJ-112 pedometers since I have a bad habit of washing or losing them. the latest to arrive, much to my surprise, no longer featured 7 day memory. It's almost impossible to remember to look at miles traveled before going to bed. Most logical time is when you get up in morning to see how the day before went. I've had this new one less than 24 hours and am already looking for a suitable replacement."
2,5 star pedometer with a zero star holder and clip,"I have 3 of these pedometers. It is a great pedometer, it's accurate and can even differentiate the number of aerobic steps taken. I especially like it because of the memory mode where I can see how many steps I've taken for the past 7 days. For the pedometer, I give it 5 stars.However I would take away 1 star because every time I bend over, the holder unclips from the top of my pants. Minus another star because the little clip at the end of the tether breaks exactly 13 months after purchase. Minus a third star because it's out of warranty and the customer (non) service people won't send out a replacement clip.So like all the other reviewers, this is a great pedometer at a great price but plan on using something (safety pin, rubber band, zipper pocket, etc.) to secure it or lose it."
4,"If your goal is 10,000 steps a day - this will help you get there","I have had this pedometer for about a month now. It was easy to set up and true to description. I never leave home without it. I clip it on and go. I am trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. It is fun to check during the day to see how many steps I have so far. Knowing it is there, I find myself taking the stairs or the long way - to get more steps in. It keeps the last 7 days history and resets itself automatically at midnight. By having the history, if I miss the goal one day, I make sure I do it the next. Tracks number of steps, miles, calories burned and keeps aerobic steps separately. I recommend this to anyone trying to get and STAY moving."
4,"Not perfect, but good","While this pedometer is the best I've used, it does have problems. First, I've lost two of them because the clip on the strap is made of plastic, and it breaks easily. I've solved this problem by buying a separate strap with a metal clasp from another company. The second problem is more serious. I have had two others fail me, each after a year's use. They simply kept resetting to zero even after having changed the battery. To test to see if I was accidentally resetting, I changed the battery, walked for a few minutes and then put the pedometer on a table. When I came back a few hours latter, it had reset. I like the pedometer enough that I'm willing to purchase a new one every year, but it would be nice if Omron could address these two problems."
4,usefull walking,"seems a good choice it tells me what I needed to know. How far I walk and the number of steps I take in a given day. Also, estimates how many calories I burn depending on the distance and steps taken.It's quite easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone needing a pedometer."
5,omron pedometer great,"I bought 2 of these pedometers one for me and one for my sister. A friend of mine at work told me her 3 sisters purchased this model and loved it.I am so pleased with them. They are very easy to use, very durable I keep dropping it from my clothes.I forget I have it on my belt or pocket. It keeps accurate records you can review for 7 days and compare each day. The best part for me is at the end of the day when I take it off and pick it up the next morning it automatically is set at zero to start the day. It is a very handy and well made product. I just love it.Thanks for your great product. Maureen Bernard"
5,Awesome product,"This is the second Omron pedometer I have purchased. My husband wanted one after I used one for a few months. We walk a lot and have fun knowing how many steps we take. The challenge is to do our daily 3 mile walk and then try to get to 10000 steps before the day ends. Even if you don't walk for exercise, you might be motivated to move more by challenging yourself with the pedometer. I was recently in Boston and walked all over town after working out on a treadmill for 3 1/2 miles. I ended up walking over 10 miles on some days! I felt great to know I had accomplished so much by tracking my progress! My husband enjoys learning how many steps he takes during a round of golf. This pedometer is especially helpful because it keeps track of how many of your steps are considered to be aerobic. If you only use the pedometer for exercise, at least you have a little more fun! Great bargain!"
2,Pedometers & the Disabled,"I bought this item for my wife, who has multiple sclerosis. She's trying to keep track of her walking distances and the number of steps she takes. Because her gait is awkward, by normal standards, and her pace is very slow, the Omron device is not able to accurately track her steps or distance. Although the unit works fine (I tested it myself), it does not work for the person who wanted it and could have benefited from it the most."
4,This product is ok,"I think this product measures your walk really accurate. I used it for a week and did not use it anymore. I tried to use it in the gym so that I can measure the calories I burned off. It only measured my steps accurately when I was on the treadmill running and walking. It does not measure your steps when you are doing cardio classes. Also, I am in my early 20s so I just wanted to know how many steps I walk on average in a day so that I can make up the other steps at the gym. I think this is a really great product if you just want to measure your steps walking or running. If you want to measure anything else such as calories burned in other excercises put another machine."
1,Really bad product - avoid,"Don't buy this ever! It claims there is a strap yet none was in the box. There is no battery in the box hence this thing is not ready to use. Even if you find a battery, the screw that closes the battery pack is so tight you cannot open the panel - at this point after trying too much there is no more grip - I will never be able to open it. I just wasted more than $20"
2,accuracy,"not very accurate,not very securable-falls off holder a lot,just not worth what it cost and would'nt recomend it junk as far I am concerned"
2,Undercounts steps - even moreso over time,"I used to wear this pedometer all the time, recognizing that is undercounted steps, most glaringly during every day activities. Frustrating, but what can we do? I took a break and started up again (my unit is a few years old) with a new battery and it is severely undercounting now, to the point where I'm going to buy a different machine. Even if I jog 100 steps, it counts about 40. Too frustrating for me. Other sites talk about undercounting as well and I wish someone would fix this problem."
4,Great Pedometer,"I like this pedometer. It did take a bit to figure out stride length but I followed the directions and once that was done, was very easy to use. Picks up steps on the elliptical as well."
4,Very Good Pedometer,"I love this pedometer.The only problems I have are these:I have found that it isn't as accurate in my pocket or anywhere other than on my waistline.I don't like that the buttons are too easily bumped and it will reset.The clip seems to slip off a lot for me, but the extra string attached does stay on.However, the good features are:It seems more accurate than most pedometers I have tried.I like that you can set the date and time and it automatically switches to a new day at midnight.I also like that it keeps a 7 day history. This helps if I forget to record my steps.I like how it shows the calories burned and this is based on my personal weight.I like that is shows the distance traveled.All in all, it is a great investment."
2,Cannot be zero'd,This arrived today and I quickly discovered its obvious design flaw. All well and good that it will calculate your distance etc over a 7 day period but its laughable that the read-out cannot be completely zero'd unless you do a complete system reset resulting in having to input the time and all your personal information again. The lack of this flexibility is a very short-sighted decision by the manufacturer.
3,Great Pedometer but....,"I've had this product for over year. It works extremely well. The User Interface its a tad klutzy (if you are looking at previous day), but it performs well.What didn't perform well, was the plastic belt holder.I called Omron Health Care to purchase a replacement, and was told, they DO NOT SELL ANY REPLACEMENT PARTS for this or other pedometers.Huh? Well if I would give them the serial number on the inside of the back cover, (I needed to find a small screwdriver and magnifying glass!) they would send me one free, BUT ONLY this one time.I was made to feel totally ungrateful, and that I was trying to get ""something for nothing,"" which was NOT the case at all.Great product. Crappy Customer Service.Incidentally, when the plastic holder breaks, the pedometer works just fine, if it's in your pocket! Avoid the hassle, and feeling like an ingrate!Wayno"
1,Would love to have been able to use it,"This device came to me sealed inside a plastic container that broke my scissors trying to cut it open. For this, Omron gets the lowest rating I can give. There is NO EXCUSE for clamshell packaging in internet orders. There is no storefront for this product to be stolen from. Thousands of people go to the hospital with injuries caused by clamshell packaging every year, mostly needing stitches for large cuts caused by the sharp edges of the plastic. This type of packaging should be banned, illegal. Amazon.com should not do any business with companies that use this kind of packaging.Don't even tell me I should rate the device and not the packaging. I paid for a device and what I got is sealed inside a plastic container I cannot open. I have every right to leave a bad review for this insult.VERY VERY ANGRY"
4,Great value and proves a point,"My last encounter with a pedometer was 20 years ago-- metal, click/clacking, dubious accuracy. This is great-- lightweight, securable (the clip holster AND extra keeper keep it secure), and works well in a handbag as well as a pocket, in addition to the tradtional method of securing on a waistband. Like others, I found accuracy at its peak when tethered mid-thigh. It counts at least quadruple steps if you're keeping an uneven pace--- so not really worth the money if you want to know how many steps you take in an average day running around the house, doing errands, etc. The real value to me is providing solid proof that I do NOT get 5000 steps in a day, unless I put forth a concerted effort."
5,Best Pedometer Ever,"Yes, this is the best Pedometer I've ever used. And I've a had a lot of them. I would recommend this without a doubt. Just remember that eventually you'll have to change the battery, but they are easy to find too!"
5,"Nicely manufactured, easy to use",Bought this item for my mother-in-law. She is not very savvy on equipment. Even at here 80 year old age she had no trouble going through the setup. Nicely made with a clip-in holster and safety strap. Other units we have tried (mostly the smaller squared units) were hard for her to program and her slow pace was not always registered. The Omron unit had no problems.
2,Alleb's review,"Several times the mileage has been abruptly canceled and gone back to zero amidst a walk, or has switched from steps to miles or reverse. Very frustrating."
4,Used for hiking,Works great! It keeps accurate mileage and it is easy to setup. A pause or reset would be nice because I have to keep the unit inverted until I get on the trail. I only want to track how far I hike; I don't want to track the drive to the trailhead. This is a major design flaw. I still give it 4 stars because of the quality and accuracy.
5,Omron HJ-112 Digital Premiun Pedometer,"I got this pedometer a few months ago and it works so well, that I just ordered another one for my brother's birthday present. I always use the safety strap in addition to the clip on holder, but have never had it slip out of the holder or the clip of the holder come undone. (This was a complaint of a previous reviewer, so I am cautious.)"
1,Good while it lasted...?,"The pedometer seemed to work well for as long as I had it, BUT unfortunately THE CRADLE AND CLIP PROVIDED DID NOT ADEQUATELY SECURE THE UNIT; hopefully, someone on a hiking trail in Zion National Park may provide further comment...."
5,works great,"I purchased these for friends. I've had mine since January & it works great. The best part is being able to just drop it in my pants pocket. It's not in the way like the kind that must be clipped (level) at your waist band. Mine is still using the original battery. That was a complaint from some people, but I'm very satisfied."
5,Omron Pedometer,This pedometer is very easy to use and figure out the set up. It's my first one to purchase and I love it! I'm really happy that it doesn't record any steps while I'm driving in my car - I've read that a lot of them do. I can either wear it or put it in my purse and it does it's job. A great pedometer.
3,Pedometer. A helping guide for exercise,"THe pedometer has great reviews and I don't disagree B U T the clip is totally worthless and the manufacturer is not willing to do anything to assist .I asked if the clip might be a faulty item and they might replace it with another that might not be faulty.""It's not our policy to do that.""Not so good customer service and as good as the unit is what good is it if ot won't stay put?Just my opinion but you asked for it"
1,Poor accuracy,"I bought this unit based on the good reviews here, however, I have found its accuracy to be inconsistent. I tried using it in my pants pocket and it was wildly innacurate, more or less doubling my step count. On my belt or waist band it was better depending on where I placed it, i.e. front back or side, but it would still add extra steps no matter where it was. One caveat to this review, I'm recvovering from a stroke and my gait is unsteady, so this might be part/all of the problem, but I thought these electronic sensor types where supposed to be better than the old mechanical pendulum type. Well, not in my case."
4,Inexpensive and very easy to use,"Very easy to use and full featured. I would have liked to know that it came with a safety strap so I didn't have to buy one separately. Which I did, because Amazon helpfully(?) suggested that customers who bought this pedometer also bought a strap."
4,"bought 3 for self, husband and friend.",This Pedometer works well once you get it set up. Instructions are somewhat confusing. Along with being a Pedometer it is a accurate digital watch. A good value.
5,Pedometer,"This was a great purchase. My husband and I each have this pedometer, he uses the belt clip and I put mine in my pocket. It automatically resets at midnight and the screen is easy to read. I highly recommend this product."
5,A discreet pedometer that works,"I've tried several pedometers over the years and many have annoying clicks, which is not what I want when walking around at work. Or if they don't click, they don't really work. This pedometer really works and is totally silent. You can throw it in a pocket or a purse, just as the instructions say and it still works.This pedometer's strength is longer walks and bouts of exercise. Short trips around the house don't register well.I've had mine for nearly 3 years and other than wearing through 3 leashes (the one weak point), it has flawlessly performed. So order extra leashes and this pedometer."
5,Great pedometer,"My husband and I each ordered one of these and we're both very pleased with them. We use them mainly for counting steps/aerobic steps and they are right on. The calorie counting and distance functions are not of interest to us, which is just as well because calorie counting cannot possibly account for variables such as incline, and our step lengths vary depending on whether we're walking or running, so distance would not be accurate. But as a step counter, these devices are everything we needed them to be. And they're small and quiet."
1,Great Pedometer wouldn't stay clipped on...it's gone,"I loved my pedometer for the short time that we had together. I was at a Physical Education Conference and it fell off for last and final time. After having it for only a few short weeks, I am very disappointed. The clip was not sufficient to hold the pedometer in place. I think I will go back to my other brand which lasted me for years."
4,Omron Digital Premium Pedometer,"The Omron Digital Premium Pedometer is better than advertised. Accurate, and simple to use. Also easy to lose, if you don't take advantage of the leash that comes with it. I had mine for a month before losing it in a taxi. Liked it well enough that I'll be ordering a second today. Would have rated it five stars if the connection for the leash was on top, instead of on bottom. This would make it easier to holster the pedometer, when I'm checking my steps. Overall very impressed with this product."
4,DIGITAL PEDOMETER,"EASE OF USE, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING COMPLICATED, JUST WANT TO PUT ON AND GO. THIS WORKS NICELY."
4,Pedometer does it's job,"I ordered 2 of these, one for myself and one for my wife. I can't report on hers because it came WITHOUT a battery! Instructions simply said ""if missing parts, contact local Omron dealer. Right, there's one just down the street, NOT! Mine does seem to do the job just fine. Easy to set up and use. As someone else mentioned, it is like a mini-motivator, ""Come on lard butt, just squeeze another 10th of a mile out"". However, the belt clip seems inadequate (needs heavier spring) as it has slipped off several times and hit the ground. Still works though... We will see how many times that can occur before it doesn't. Overall, good product."
3,Omron Pedometer HJ112 - Works Great But .......,"This Omron pedometer is really nice. It is light weight and fits right in the pocket. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is that there is no way to turn it off. The booklet indicated that it does shut off automaticaly. I called Omron and they told me the book was incorrect and the only way to shut it off was to remove the batteries. When you remove the batteries you loose all your data. Guess I should have checked the reviews ahead of time, then I would NOT have purchased it. If the battery is NOT an issue for you, then I would say go ahead and buy it. It operates great!"
1,trying to enter correct settings is rather complicated,"I wanted a pedometer to measure the amount of walking I do, for weight-loss purposes...haven't been able to use it yet, because am still trying to enter the rather complicated settings...am disappointed with the product..not ""user-friendly."""
3,Review better than the product,I read the reviews before purchasing this product. It wasn't user friendly and didn't work the way I needed it to.
4,Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer,"This product works very well. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little heavy, and I have to be very careful what pants I wear with it so it doesn't pull the waistband down. I wear it every day, checking it from time to time to see my progress."
1,Wish I could review it...but it never arrived...,"I ordered this item and had it delivered to a friend. I checked with her about one month after the item was ordered, and she said she never got it. The product probably is fine, but I have to question Amazon's ability to deliver. I've never had this problem before with Amazon, and am somewhat surprised by the situation."
2,"one out of three didn't work. Sent it back, no refund yet",One of the three did not work. I sent it back and have not received a credit on my visa account or any other acknowledgement that it was returned. I followed the return directions to the letter. Would like to hear from you...
5,Great product!,"I've purchased about a dozen pedometers over the yeears, this is by far the best. I would never buy a pedometer without a securing clip again. Occasionally it slips out of the holder but I do not lose it because it is also clipped on. It measures regular steps and aerobic steps. It saves several days of data. Great product and well worth the cost."
4,Best,I really like the holder and strap on this pedometer as I have lost and broken 3 lesser expensive one. It also has all the features I like plus the memory feature. Have been extremely satisfied with this model which is also easy to set and use in comparasion to some I have looked at before.
5,Best pedometer I have had!,This is the best pedometer I have ever had. I wear it everyday.It is very accurate.
5,I am impressed,"I've always been skeptical of pedometers but always wanted one.Day 1, I counted 470 steps, pedometer displayed 469.Day 2, I counted 470 steps again, pedometer displayed 468.Day 3, I counted 575 steps, pedometer displayed 575.I HIGHLY recommend this to all my friends."
3,"It works, but on OFF button would be nice.","This certainly does the job, but since it cannot be turned off, it's going to wear the battery out more quickly."
5,pedometer,this is a reliable easy to use product that helps focus your attention on walking and getting in shape.
5,Love it!,"This pedometer works just great. One of my favorite features is the fact that it keeps track of the data for 7 days. I like to keep a log of my exercise but some days I am busy and don't have a chance to do so. No problem - I can just check back on the pedometer. As for the 'belt clip' about which some reviewers complained, I see NO PROBLEM. I keep the pedometer in my pocket and just clip it to the pocket edge - it has never come loose. I agree that the clip would not attach to the thickness of a leather belt, but if you want to attach it to your belt, the solution is simple - just loop the strap around the belt and then attach the clip back to the strap."
5,Omron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer,Easy to use and has a memory so you can go back and get step you my have missed to add to you log (with in I week. This is a great product.
5,Omron HJ-112 pedometer versus Accusplit Eagle Pedometer,"I have used pedometers 24/7 during the past 9 years and during this time have been frustrated by their lack of accuracy, consistency, and reliability. For the most part, I have relied on the Accusplit Eagle XL-120 pedometer because it is reasonably accurate, inexpensive, and it is simple. However, the battery doesn't last long and the pedometer doesn't accurately count steps when doing yard work, housework, etc. Recently I switched to the Omron HJ-112 pocket pedometer and I have found it to be accurate during exercise walks as well as during casual activities. It also has a few extra features such as aerobic step-count, calories burned, and miles walked. It costs no more than the Accusplit pedometer. My only question is battery life, which will be revealed in time. I really like the convenience of a pocket pedometer over a belt pedometer. The Omron lives up to its high marks as published in Consumer Reports."
2,"Overcounts Steps and lousy, lousy, lousy belt clip","I have to admit I only had this pedometer for a week and I suspected that it was over-counting my steps. But that wasn't as annoying as the fact that the first weekend I had it I clipped it on to my belt so I could count the steps down to the farmer's market and back and by the time I got to the market it had fallen off! Ah well, it gave me some idea of how many steps I am taking daily and how much more I need to ramp up to 10,000."
4,Great motivator,"I loved this pedometer. It was the first one I bought, but I wanted something that was reliable and could track my steps when walking on campus for school. It motivated me to take longer routes to class and it was rewarding to see how many miles I walked and calories burned throughout the day. The thing I loved most though was that I could just keep it in my bag instead of clipping it on my waist. The only downside, was that I didn't fill out the warranty slip, and maybe two or three months after I bought it, it stopped counting steps correctly until it broke down all together. But I plan on buying the next model up from this one very soon!"
4,Step Counter,"Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium PedometerThis is a great way to follow your excercise program. Walking, running, jogging. This pedometer will show you whether you have done ""enough""...encourages me to continue until I've meet my 3 mile per day goal."
5,A Walker's Best Friend,"I can't say this is the best pedometer on the market because I haven't tried them all, but if it isn't, it would have to be in the top three. Once you set the length of your step and the time, the rest is automatic. The Omron HJ-112 is an extremely accurate pedometer. I like to take different routes in the neighborhood for variety, so it's nice to know how far I've gone. The time function means you don't have to wear a watch, and the memory function basically tells you how consistent you are in reaching daily personal goals. Other functions, such as calorie count and distance are posted, but not that important if you have a specific distance goal. I shoot for 10,000 steps a day, and I'm losing weight and toning up as a result. I actually look forward to daily walks. Just hook the Omron to your waistband, attach the safety clip to a pocket or belt loop, and go. It's a quality product, it is easy to read, and it works."
4,Top dog,"My wife likes it so much, I'm trying to take it off her hands. I love the fact you have to calibrate it to the persons gender, weight and paces. Thats how they should all work concidering everyone has a different stride. One gripe, you cann't turn it off, very small issue never the less, great little product"
4,Easy to use and sturdy,"Easy instructions, and easy to use. I was concerned about the review that mentioned breaking after dropping. I have accidentally dropped it multiple times on multiple services and it has not broken."
3,It works ok,It workes ok tells your basic miles or calories burned. can't figure out how to reset You would have to judge
4,I love it!,"Nothing's perfect, but this comes pretty darn close. I love it. It does exactly what I want it to do."
5,"loved this so much, need to order another one.","(I lost it...so, will replace with identical product. The clock feature is also very helpful; i use it more than my cell to check the time!"
2,it counted more steps than I actually took.,I purchased this product due to the reviews and I am very disappointed. I did several test to see how accurate it was. It counted more steps than I actually took. I even picked up 5 steps driving to work. It is not worth the money. I took it back the next day.
3,"OK, I guess",I found this very clunky. I also didn't feel like it was all that accurate. I just purchased the Jaw Bone Up and have been much happier so far.
3,Omron Pedometer,"This item does count steps accurately but it doesn't allow you to calibrate in inches your step length. Distance seems to be measured in terms of your step length, so it's a rough estimate at best in measuring distance covered. For instance I've been training for a marathon and my pedometer mileage is never the same as what we covered in training, it's always about 3-4 miles off. One person recommended to me to get an accurate tally, use for a rule of thumb 2000 steps equals a mile. By dividing total steps by 2000 this indeed was a more accurate portrayal of the distance covered. I'm also not sure if the calorie counter is accurate as well. At any rate, the pedometer is comfortable to wear and relatively easy to program and use. The price was also very reasonable for the quality of the product."
5,Great Pedometer,This pedometer is an excellent way to track your activity throughout the day and week. It's very easy to use and seems to track pretty accurately the amount of steps taken. I would recommend it to anyone not looking for something really sophisticated.
4,"Not perfect, but nice","Well it's not perfectly accurate, but I guess it's not a bad thing if you are trying to walk off a few pounds. At least it says I've taken less than more. It has a nice belt clip, but still can pop off if you aren't careful."
4,Wash and wear,"Of course I don't recommend washing it ROUTINELY...but if you accidentally leave the pedometer in your pocket and throw your pants in the washer, fear not! I was very annoyed with myself when I discovered my dripping wet pedometer in the bottom of my washer. It was so wet the water was flowing back and forth across the inside of the screen. Figuring that I had nothing to lose, I removed all the screws and took the unit COMPLETELY apart (not hard to do...just keep track of all the tiny screws)and let it air dry for a day. Today I re-assembled it and TA DA!!! It works flawlessly! I haven't had it long enough to use all the features so I can't rate those. But it is easy to set and obviously hardy!"
3,Pocket pedometer,"The Omron Digital pedometer is very helpful as a step counter, however it does seem to count a few more steps than I actually have taken. (It sort of has a hair trigger.) I like the pocket use as I tend to have the pedometers slip off my waistband when I am bending over."
3,KKLJ,"The pedometer works well and captures accurate information. It's a bit bulky, at least 1.25"" from clip to front. The only reason for 3 of 5 stars is because it's not very rugged. Be sure not to drop it! I accidently dropped mine on a tile floor. It landed on the clip side (not the face of the pedometer). Since then the hundred digit no longer displays the entire digit. There's so little of it showing, I'm having to guess at the number. The pedometer seems well-built and not flimsly at all, but one drop and it's not functioning properly."
3,"Great pedometer, terrible clip, lost it within a week",This pedometer was great but the clip is terrible. I lost it within the first week that I had it. Think twice before buying!
3,Amazon - Omron HJ-112,"Best and most accurate one I have had so far. Easy to use, however I suggest you attach it with a safty strap/cable. I use the strap that comes with it and attach the strap to the devise and then lock it on to a belt loop. I have found it hanging by the strap several times. I wished I had bought the strap that goes around the neck, but I was concerned it may not work right hanging from my neck."
5,Brilliant,A little difficult to set your step accurately but no more so than for any other pedometer. Gives lots of information and inspires to walk further.
2,Great accuracy - display defective - costly & hassle to return,"I purchased two of these early this summer. I found it to be easy to set up and very accurate. Within two weeks the digital readout started to malfunction leaving only a portion of the numbers legible. I paid for the return of it and another was sent to me that has worked well. The 2nd one, received as part of the original order, worked well for two months and then the same thing happened. Neither problem occurred after dropping it or other possible answers. I replaced the battery but the display continued to malfunction. When contacting the company, since it was under warranty, I was told I would need to send it back at my expense, pay another $8 for their costs and they highly recommended that I insure it as well. After realizing the cost I was incurring at this point was almost to the point of what I had paid originally - I decided to give up and try a different brand."
5,terriffic tracking,This pedometer is the best I've ever used. It is so easy to understand and program. If offers many options without getting highly technical. Will proabably buy a few for stocking stuffers.
3,Creating a Newsletter in InDesign,I received the book in just a few day s and it was in excellent condition.The book was useful and helped me complete a project. I set up several templates for organizations to use to produce their newsletters.I still needed time to practice using the features in Indesign because they are not easy to remember.Deborah
2,Close but no cigar,"The southern setting is charming. The plot had potential. However, the characters need more depth and if you blinked you would have missed the ending. This book doesn't quite fulfill it's promise. The best part was the description of the food!"
4,Brit ska and so much more.....,"A wonderful followup to their first album, this one covers much wider range of styles. It can seem a disappointment when compared to their classic first album, but if you take it out of that context, it stands as a terrific album on its own. Each song has a totally different style to it. But why did they change the album art? The original lp art from 1981 was so much more charming. The US pressing also includes ""Too Nice to Talk To"", a terrific single which was not on the original vinyl lp."
1,Vita Padding/Door Stop,"The authors are apparently in need of adding a ""book"" to their vitae and believe that making it grossly overlarge will improve their academic status. There is virtually no reason to buy this book because it lacks focus for subspcialtists and is too quirky and out of date (and too long) for a general text. That is, there are many much better texts for medical students, researchers, psychologists, neuropsychiatrists and experts in all the subdiciplines of behavioral neurosciences. I strongly suspect that this work will vanish from the list of books in print because it is useful to no one and has little to credit it outside of two or three decent chapters, a poor hit rate for a work with more than 50"
2,Small in size and Letter design could be cleaner.,"CON - messy design presentation of the letters.Received this as gift and upon looking at the other options, would much prefer letters that were presented in a cleaner and thus clearer design in case of easier recognition for our child. The patterns are distracting in color as well as unattractive designs and the style font is rather messy. Some of the letters may be difficult to distinguish. For example the Y from the V, because of how they are presented.CON - small size problematic for some drains.They work fine as foam toys in the bath, but the most detrimental factor is their size, because our drain is a rather large one and our curious 2.5 year old easily crammed one of the letters down our bathtub drain on the very first day. To our consternation we realized that quite a few of the letters were of the size to follow suit."
3,Somewhat good,"Well written and absorbing in parts ... I occasionally found myself drawn into the story and the plight of Jander, and I have to admit, the part where we here about the background of Stahd had me sitting rigid on the edge of my seat. Some parts of the book, however, were a dissapointment. It tried to follow the plot line of Ravenloft a bit too much to be taken as an independent novel, yet screwed with the physics of AD+D enough to be rather frustrating for an experienced gamer. Thus, both the plot fell somewhat short due to the restrictions under which the author was writing, and the human characters who appeared in the second half seemed to me to be completely bogus. Still, it was an entertaining read, and haunting in parts."
1,Why ?,"Why is everybody giving this book such good credit ? For starters I'd like to congradulate Cristy for this is a well written book but that doesn't mean that it's good. The story itself is dull, there are a few things happening and it's ""on the same roll"" during the whole book. There doesn't anything exiting happen in it. I don't want to give anything away about this book but I'll say that I admit that during the end I was curious of what would happen...but guess what, the end turned out to be worse than the whole book. It took all the nonsense that had been mixing up and blew it in your face. Besides, it really didn't explain anything and the things it did explain were just plainly stupid. Read another book -"
5,A Tool Kit with real tools--,"A practical, yet inspiring read that gives the tools it promises to promising writers and old hands, alike, in an engaging and clearly understood manner. I had it in my car to read on the way home (I wasn't driving). Found myself looking forward to my time with it and was a little sad to reach the end. I highly recommend."
5,She's the top.,"One of ouir greatest folk singers, at the top of her form, with superb material. Voice like crystal; I can listen forever"
3,A mixed bag,"Toru Hashimoto compiled this CD, that goes from Mary Wilson's soulful vocals on The Supremes' ""Early Morning Love"", to Jeanne Moreau's ""Les voyages"", from Esther Phillips and Eddie Kendricks, to Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. The best way to listen to this weird compilation is to program your CD player, and listen to Stephanie Mills, The Bar-Kays, Diana Ross and the other soulful performers, and avoid the un-soulful tracks. Some are not precisely bad, like Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66's ""Tristeza"", but... what is it doing after Martha Reeves and the Vandellas' ""I Want You Back"" and before Gloria Gaynor's ""Casanova Brown""?"
1,unusable,"I return this item. It did not focus, let alone auto focus. Also, it was so hard to attached to the camera, that I was afraid I would break something."
1,Do NOT order these from Acedepot,"The products I received were NOT Nu-Kote ribbons, they were GRC ribbons. Some good old-fashioned truth in advertising would be refreshing."
3,"Works great, but no Identification on product","Ribbon came in a cellophane wrap with no identification either on wrapping or spools.No way to tell if it is the Nukote brand advertised or generic replacement. However, it works fine...Product was received quickly. I'm sorry I didn't buy a larger package of them, multiple spools cost only a little more than the individual rolls."
5,"Practical, helpful, and impacting","The 10 Best Decisions are practical, impacting, and have the power to strengthen relationships within a family. I often read parenting books and wonder ""do they really have kids?"". Not so with this book. It recognizes the struggles and joys that every parent has, but offers 10 decisions to build a strong foundation with your children."
4,Excellent product,"Excellent product, for persons had allergy and don't like grays.....I usually use it every ten days.. easy to use..and easy to apply ."
5,Boys Dream,"To every boy, and every 50 or 60 year old, boy at heart, you need this. Written by a genious, this book has everything you need to keep yourself busy. I, myself as a student in his amazing class, can certainly vouch for the fact that, in truth: This book is so well written and so funny, you will wish that YOU could write a book right now! So get on it, and take yourself on an adventure."
3,A fun reference book!,A fun book to reference when I'm with my grandsons. They think I'm a fun grandmama for teaching them some of these games/antics.
3,Expected a bit more from Robing Cook,"First of all I must admit that Robin Cook's medical thrillers are amongst my favorite books. ""Invasion"", however, fell a bit short of my high expectations. It is not bad and quite a page-turner, but it is not particularly good either. The story is simply too 'flat', predictable and rather uneventful. Read one of Robin Cook's many other books instead and enjoy!"
3,An alien invasion without aliens,"Kind of different alien invasion, I have to admit that this book is very different of all aliens books, but the end of it is really out of reality and the love story of the book is completely pathetic, nevertheless the book will keep you reading to the end, but you will be disappointed with that end, and the final question is: where are the aliens? Read this book on your vacations and that will be fine with this book."
2,Cook trying to be Crichton,"I do love Robin Cook's novels. They are so compelling, fun, and a good read. But this one seemed like the author was trying to write like someone he is not. It almost seemed like a Michael Crichton novel, but it turned out so second rate if that was the intention, it fell very flat.You will find the book a page-turner, but at the end you will feel it was not nearly what you had expected from this usually good author."
5,Science Fiction,This book was great. About how people try to save the world from becoming aliens. The people study DNA's and all vacines ever made to cure this virus of black disks. You can't know how it'll end. It's amazing.
3,Not his best but good,It is not the typical Robin Cook but it kept me interested enough to finish the book. I don't normally like science fiction but because of his ability to make his characters real and have you care about them it worked. I do hope he goes back to his medical mysteries though
3,"Good reading, but poor ending","Invasion was an easy to read book. It was interesting and had a good plot building up, but the last 80 or so pages really let me down."
2,A mindless one-sitting read,"Good escapism for an evening, but not all that well thoughtout or written. Mankind hangs on by a thread again!"
3,it was ok,"hmmmm, unfortunately i watched almost all of the telemovie before reading this and realising it was a Robin Cook novel. The movie was porr, with attempts at fleshin out Beau by Luke Perry. Hmmmm, the book was better, bu I prefer the more medical based novels, Like Coma.Tiff"
1,oh heck!,"I love Robin Cook's stuff soooooooo much..and I also love sci fi. As a medical professional, I picked up this book thinking here is a marriage of my two fav subjects, medicine and sci fi..and was so disappointed. THis book would have been great if it had been written in the 50s..or 60's--truly ground breaking..but for now? It's old hat. Im sorry, Robin! Do better next time, ok?"
4,Play it over and over,"This game is the funniest out of all the Call of Duties. Its super long (which can be a pain and be good and get your moneys worth) and the graphics are really good for 2004. Just warning you, I think Activision shut down the multiplayer because I used the play the multiplayer all the time but now it won't let me open the game. Looked everywhere and no body can figure it out. Still fun though."
3,Exsibit A= Mainstram video gaming,"The gaming industuty is getting to big for it self.Call of Duty is a great game for the masses, I mean just look at all the people up in here raveing about how this is the best gaming experice they ever had. Get a grip, Game of the year come on have a little restrent.I love these kids yelling about the game play, its the same damn game as Madel of honer, and not to say that a bad thing but 4 year.the games based on the Quake 3 engine which is nice becuse it runs like a dream, but this is 2004 fokes and my readoon 9700 pro is derect X9 compadible, so the game aint realy pushing any graphicly bonderys.uh yea and i was like whatever"
4,Consuming FPS that puts you in the action,"I am a more mature gamer and like the realistic sims, RPG and FPS type games. I played the demo first and then bought the full version and it has been a lot of fun. When you are playing a game, but you are hesitant to look around the next corner and your heart rate goes up anticipating being shot at - you are in the game. The controls are quick and easy to master. The graphics occassionally leave a hand or other article halfway through a wall, but overall they aren't bad. The range of difficulty levels is good allowing you to get shot a lot at the entry level and only taking two hits or so at Veteran level. It really gives you a good appreciation for what it would have felt like to be in some of those WWII engagements."
2,Highly Disappointed,"I was highly disappointed in Call of Duty. After all the hype, I expected a flawless gaming experience. However, the squad mates get in the way and refuse to move sometimes, and in my opinion they hamper the single player experience. The easiest level is ridiculously easy, and the difficult level is insanely difficult. Graphics were ok, but there was the occasional enemy soldier poking through the brick wall for all to see.In summary, I know the squad additions were supposed to take this game to the next level; however, they actually made the whole genre regress. Don't waste your money or time, albeit you'll only be wasting a very few hours as the game is short, short, short..."
3,Ho Humm,"Well, I just finished Call of duty and although it was a decent game, I'm not sure why there is so much hype. I mean, the game points the way for you. I felt like I was in a very narrow box..The best part about playing is when you shoot, you can see feedback of where your bullets land: like on the walls behind the soldiers you are shooting at.The game goes very quick and doesn't take long to finish at all. I played it twice just to be sure I didn't miss anything. I think WW2 shooters are played out and I can't wait for the release of Deus Ex 2!Be seeing you~Corey"
4,Blow the heck out of it,"This game is fun, and for some people, challenging. You can play side by side with American, British and Russian soldiers blasting through German tanks, machine guns and more. If you dont want to be a dead man, then stay with your men unless you have to go alone or if you need to, flank them. My favorite things to do are sniping, blowing up tanks and, last but not least, sabotaging a huge German building by yourself. I recommend doing quick saves often, especially before hard parts or when you are low on health. Overall I thought this game was great, but brutal."
5,"Call of Duty, another WWII game that wins the jackpot!","Call of Duty is a WWII game that takes you around Europe in an anti-Nazi shoot-em up. In the game, you play an American private named Martin, Sgt. Evans of the British, and a Russian sniper, which is a pretty good mix of historical accuracy.Positive: Apart from killing Nazi's there is lack of swearing, no fear of F-bombs, and Rambo is not welcome. In Battlefield 1942, you had ""Springtime for Hitler"" Germans who run around shooting for no reason. In Call of Duty, you had some Germans that acted like real people. Please note that the thrill of the kill can be exciting and damaging at the same time.Negative: Mild language creeps up in this game. Apart from that, the Russians are cruel and though you don't see it, they shoot a deserter which is not a kiddie scene.Conclusion: Call of Duty is the best WWII game I've played so far. I recommend it, although you should be at least a mature 12+ to play the game."
1,This made even my life look interesting.,"Russian woman marries into wealthy and powerful Italian family and raises a family. Her ""passions"" are stirred (yes, that was intentional) by a young chef. A stultify treatment of the story ensues."
3,Yum yum,"Extremely high gloss hokum. I'm not a film buff but this is probably one for Swintonites (those eyes!), though all the cast were riveting - school of Chocolat maybe?. Some words lodge in the mind as though spoken in English (it helps that it was a voiceover): 'I have been with a woman. It was beautiful. I don't know if I'll see her again.' (NB this is NOT the main plotline!) Kind of Buddenbrooks meets Splendor in the Grass"
4,a great book for Halloween,"""Ten Timid Ghosts"" by Jennifer Barrett O'Connell has got to be one of the greatest books to read to kids around Halloween time. I recently read this to my daughter and some of her friends. They all laughed at the goofy disguises that the witch wears to scare the ghosts.I think it is great that this book counts backwards from ten. It is always useful to teach something in books like this. Yet what I truly appreciate about ""Ten Timid Ghosts"" is the good story. Reading is so crucial for kids. It takes a truly gifted artist to absorb them in a story. I commend Mrs. O'Connell for doing just that here.If you want a great book to read to younger kids this Halloween, you need look no further than ""Ten Timid Ghosts."" I recommend this book."
1,Wrong labels,I purchased diskette labels (30331). The labels had correct markings on the box however the labels in the box were postage labels. The company sent a replacement for this order but the labels in the box were still postage labels. Money was refunded.
5,"You MUST have this book, if you have children","This amazing story made me cry with happiness. There are very few stories I've found that are absolutely perfect in every respect, this book is one of them. The illustrations are beautiful, the story just right. It embodies all the best qualities I want my little man to develop, and is a heartwarming, timeless tale. If you have children of any age, this should be on your bookshelf."
1,Pseudo of Balasuriya and Helen Stanton,"This book is very good if you need to know about erroneous opinion regarding Christianity. This controversial book will be easily found 'ridiculous' and 'illogical' if it is read at least by a schoolar, which understand the topic that been presented. Tissa Balasurya (ex.) is so obvious, he wrote this essay based upon his own 'opinion', and not on the based of fact, his argument cannot be supported by any fact what so ever, nothing to support his thesis, it is worst than a high school student essay. I personally didn't uderstand how could it be for Mr. Balasurya and Helen Staton to claim themself as a 'theologian', are this title become so vain these days that can be used by a high school graduate? Please read this book and you will understand well what I'm talking about. This book should be titled ""Pseudo of Balasurya and Staton"", because this book are not worthy to be given a rational consideration."
1,Unbelievable amount of TYPOS!!!!,"It's unprecedented to have this many typos in an accounting/number related educational book. The irony! It was pointed out in another review (which I wished I had read prior to buying) that the book was published with numbers where symbols should be, defeating the entire purpose of clear explanations. Unbelievable. Is the publisher even aware? The poor people that get this book and are trying to understand something as DRY as bookkeeping and might believe for a minute (or more) that ""A 5 E"" vs Assets = Equities."
3,Bookkeeping Made Simple book,"I will be using this book to teach basic accounting & bookkeeping concepts in a non-credit adult class. The format of the book appears to be user friendly, and the explanations are relatively easy to understand."
2,Not very helpful,"The book starts ok, but then there are many examples that are not very clear. it is definetly not a book for a beginer, if you dont know nothing about bookkeeping, this book wont help much."
5,Good for Fulfilled-by-Amazon,"This is a good product if you are selling products that you plan to have fulfilled by Amazon. It is the required size for labeling your products and the labels come off when you want them to, without leaving residue on your books or other products. As our business progresses I plan to order this product on a regular basis."
1,Did I get a bad batch?,"I've used these for several years, but the most recent batch is not good. These things used to peel off like a heavy duty post-it note in one piece. This batch takes the top layer off the cardstock, leaves bits of label, and generally makes a mess."
4,Great Futuristic Romance,"I have to admit, I was a little apprehensive about reading this book. I've recently read this authors other book ""A WARRIOR'S TOUCH"" and absolutely hated it.This book was a pleasant surprise. The beginning was a bit confusing for me with all the different Corridors and Zones. The characters were interesting & entertaining. The book was fast paced with so many twist and turns in just the right places that kept me hooked to the very end. The ending was excellent surprised ending. If your looking for a romance with a lot of graphic sex this book may not be for you. This is truly an emotional romance with a little bit of sex to spice it up.This author has redeemed herself in my eyes."
4,Guilty pleasure,"This series of manga is neither terribly original, nor intelligent, but I am drawn to them anyway. Cute illustrations, at least."
1,What a waste of money!,"This book earned one star for having made a couple interesting points. However, there is no progression or continuity in thought development, and the writing style demonstrates a fragmented, sporadic thinking process. This makes it extremely frustrating to try to follow along and make sense of what the author is trying to say. Like listening to a person who recognizes an interesting idea he doesn't fully understand, when he tries to explain it, the idea is rendered indefensible because he not capable of explaining it. The author introduces a topic, meanders away from it, and then draws conclusions! Because he jumps from one idea to another, he doesn't present cohesive ideas or clearly convey meanings. I'm amazed to see how many books he has to his credit. This one is superficial, if not artificial. It is a complete turn-off to anyone eager to learn more about regression therapy."
3,"Color was great, chemicals harsh","The color was great, did not turn my hair black as some dark brown dyes have done in the past. The conditioner was also nice, and kept my hair soft. however, I was not happy with the chemicals in this product. It seems there is one that is questionable, and I do wonder if that is the reason Clairol has discontinued this line of dye?"
5,Excellent Trailer,"Love this trailer!!! Used it for my 2 kids (2 and 4 yrs old). The trailer was so light, it didn't add any weight when biking. The seat belts were very secured (not velcro, but hooked) and padded so that it did not scratch the kids. Easily folds flat for storage and takes less than 5 minutes to get the trailer ready."
4,A wonderfull book for the beginner,"Let me congratulate the author for the thoughtful and simple layout of the book first. It covers the beetle's mechanical history in a concise manner as well as instructs the ""will be modifier"" of the pitfalls and of all that is involved in undertaking a modification. Chapters on suspension, transmission and brakes are extremely well written and aided by lot of useful pictures. I'd very much recommend this book to any body who wants to undertake any modification to his/her beetle as well as to anybody who owns one."
3,OK not that good as expected,Good game. But it only take 24 hours to complete the whole game. Graphic are good. Best for that kinda price
1,Midnight Club,When I recieved the game it was a different demo game in the box. Don't purchase games from this Company or Person
4,GOOD GAME takes forever to load,"so the game itself is entertaining. you get to do career mode which is fun and everything. its difficult, not really challenging, I basically get 1st place in everything. its basically like the previous midnight clubs on ps2. however the only bad thing that i would say about the game, its the 2 month long load times. holy bananas, once you finish a race and go to the next or go to and from the garage, it seriously takes forever. At first i thought i had a defective game it was that bad.Overall, I would recommened this to people that love racing games, or would like to just race/drive occasionally, because you can cruise around the cities they offer. (san diego and atlanta)"
3,Not as good as its premise sounded,"Based on the recap on the back, this book had a great setup: paralyzed hero, nasty ex-fiance, adoring heroine. But I found the story disappointing. Rico's sudden sexual interest in Gianna was much too abrubt of a change and never convincing and Gianna was a bit too much of a wimp. Also, the last confrontation with Chiara was off-page, so we couldn't even enjoy Chiara's comeuppance."
5,Definitive. Priceless,I cannot overstate how much I love this.THE best bossa nova.Perfect. Make sure you get casa as well.
2,Disappointing - especially from Coleman,"The product description states clearly that this little device can be used in all weather conditions.When unpacked, this does not appear to be the case, and when you read the instructions, on the bottom of the page in small print it says that the product in NOT to be used outdoors unprotected!For a device that is meant to keep a battery 'topped up', typically devices that are not near shelter (snow blowers, tractors, automatic entrance gates, etc) this seems like a fatal design flaw!Other than that - the device seems to work fine as a trickle charger."
5,out charges a 1000 amp,"love this product got a older version from wallmart auto section i can turn on my truck ( without motor runing ) play my radio that is hooked up to a cappacitor , a 1000 watt amp ( volevenhag ) and a 800 watt bass speaker ( volvenhag ) for 5 or even 6 hrs , attempt to start truck and ALWAYS TURNS OVER .the charge is more than what it can drain I would highly recomend it , even holds potential for Police cruisers and I hope they look into itRyan PeacockFlorida Security Officer"
1,Junk,This is complete junk. The one I received puts out over 12 volts on the 9 volt setting and around 9 on the six volt setting. Do not use this on anything you care about unless you have a voltmeter to check the output.
1,2 Broken Printers,"After reading raving professional reviews, I purchased a Magicolor 2530DL for home use. The printer only works with 20 lb. paper; it leaves white vertical streaks on everything but the test page; and now says ""media jam fuser"" and ""prints"" blank paper. I called tech support so many times, that they finally sent me a replacement Magicolor 2530DL printer. They didn't send me all of the information to send the first one back. So, now I have two. Neither of the printers work. I'm looking for a good place to get them repaired. Professional tech reviewers need to pay attention to how long the items work well."
1,Junk!!,I liked them until they strated shorting out like madness after the first gentle 5 minutes of use. Save your money and buy a Mogami cable.
2,so so build quality,"I have used two of these regularly (meaning each day for atleast 10 minutes minimum, during the last 2 years). Sound quality is 7/10 with inline volume contol. Also there is a mic switch that can adjust the sensitivity of the mic so that the person on the other end has the best chance of hearing you well.The only think that I did not like with this headset was the weakness of the plug that fits into the phone - the plastic cracked after about a year. Also the points at which the cables attach to the 2.5mm plug and to the head support eventually wear out making it impossible to use the headsets.For about USD10 its an ok buy, but Plantronics could improve on the weak points and still keep the price low as well as save the environment from yet more wiring and plastic."
4,Very good multi-vitamin,"Life Force Multiple is a very good multi-vitamin and mineral supplement. It was recommended to me by my doctor, and I have been taking it for about three years."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is certainly an improvement on the last book, perhaps realising that rough and not quite there bits and pieces aren't actually stories, when the book says a collection of stories.Magic For Beginners : The Faery Handbag - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : The Hortlak - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : The Cannon - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : Stone Animals - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : Catskin - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : Some Zombie Contingency Plans - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : The Great Divorce - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : Magic for Beginners - Kelly LinkMagic For Beginners : Lull - Kelly LinkAccessory home hunt.4 out of 5Zombies and bad pjs.3 out of 5Shot through of holes.2.5 out of 5Vermin takeover.3.5 out of 5Witches and felines combo = bad.3 out of 5Simple monsters, with jailbait.3.5 out of 5Dead wife bad bonker.3 out of 5Foxy lady Library larceny lives.3.5 out of 5Dodgy games are definitely very boring.2 out of 5"
1,it was an extremely boring book which was hard to follow,Puddn'head Wilson written by Mark Twain was a very boring book and was at times hard to follow. First we know who the victim is so it makes the whole trisl scene stupid and boring. Also the book doesn't spell out the crime so that makes the book very complicated
4,Okay,"Have yet to read this book. Bought it for a school assignment. Assignment involves annotating the entire book. If you are buying for this reason I would tell you to get a different copy because these pages and text are so small and compact that there is little room for annotation. The book did arive very quickly and in good condition. so if you are not using this book for school, go for it!"
5,Pudd'nhead Wilson (Bantam Classics),"Great book..outstanding story/plot. Reading this again in my 40s. Mark Twain was way ahead of his time. Should be a must read for EVERY Jr. high kid. Amazon is my ""goto"" supplier for books....always great value, low shipping costs (great vendors). Enjoy the book!"
3,An interesting premise but ultimately fails,"An interesting premise for a book that fails in many ways. There is a very fascinating idea for a suspenseful, tragic and great novel in here but the author fails to build suspense in creating an obvious and inevitable plot."
5,Don't Hate It,"Although I haven't yet bought the DVD it's on my wishlist and I plan to get as a gift (even if it has to be me to me).I watch every week with my family (me in my 20's and my stepmom in her 50's) we watched the orignal Degrassi Jr. High and Degrassi High in the early 90's and loved it then. Corny, Quirky, Funny, Fun, Serious and even had it's sad moments when dealing with death and harder issues. So when we heard about The Next Generation we had to set up our weekly Degrassi night. Now we can't wait to get Season 1 on DVD and for new episodes to start and also become ava. on DVD.I also suggest checking out the orignal Jr High and High version (currently only on VHS!)"
5,love degrassi so much baby!!!,i love this show u have to buy this this starts degrassi off with everything for the show and its probably one of the best shows and seasons of all time on degrassi that is!!!
3,lacking characters,"degrassi the next generation is okay but compared to the original degrassi junior high its not diverse enough in my opinion.where are the black males we don't exist no more. I like the original better because you they had black males doing positive things. the only black male they had on the next generation is a trouble maker. watching the next generation it looks like black males are extinct. I like the old one better. I'll keep watching the seasons to see if black males appear. ""the dark ones"""
2,Not Worth the Price,"My daughter received this for Christmas. She loved the idea that it was a ""Bratz"" item. After she started using it for her Bratz dolls, it didn't take long for her to get tired of it. The inside compartments won't stay in. She got tired of always having to put it back together and won't even play with it anymore."
5,Unbelievable!,"I have 23 years in the IT and am learning wireless technology. This is evidently the killer app that everyone is talking about. Before reading this book (which I found accidentally) I did not know about this opportunity.You must already know how wireless works to understand the utmost. You will find that there are many fabulous wireless books for introducing the technology (ex. Jimenez, Rhoton, Bedell). Then you must understand the amazing options and here you will be pleased with this book but you will also want to read about software radios and the new technology for GSM ( Andersson, Ganto, Zakhov)."
3,"Not bad, but lacking in several areas.","The Good:Well written, clear, reasonably humorous, refreshing informal style.Some good hacks that wouldn't normally get written up in a technical bookCan be read in an hour or two.The Bad:Too short (especially for price). Cursory coverage of many topicsMost of the information is readily available on the web -- i.e. linked from any wireless community webpage.First few chapters are just fillers (Describes Community networks, explains what is NAT, DHCP, Firewalling -- but very basic).If one removes the preface, appendix and other fillers, we're left with around 80 pages of content.Overall, I did learn a few things from the book, but it is thoroughly lacking substance."
4,Excellent but outdated.,"This is a good primer on building wireless networks, and it is thoughtfully and humorously written. However, the expansion of the 3G network (and no doubt many other things) makes its usefulness increasingly questionable."
3,Get Alan Moore's Wild Worlds instead,"Alan Moore: Wild Worldsincludes this story, so you're better off getting that as it contains a lot of other Moore stories in the Wildstorm universe.This story is a good read, though, even if Moore didn't like his work for Image (he has an axe to grind against DC don't forget), I definitely feel it to be a crack above their work without him."
2,Not worth the price I paid for it.,"Who ever the video production company was that made this piece of ""hoop"" did a terrible job. There are various annoying ""pops"" and ""clicks"" through out the entire video. Sounds like a really old 35mm film that's been played too many times. Highway Star by Deep Purple. This version of the song must have been recorded when Ritchie Blackmore(lead guitarist) and Ian Gillian(vocals) were feuding. Not a good way to promote Deep Purple. Jethro Tull & Johnny Winter weren't half bad, but Carlos Santana's Black Magic Woman was cut off before the song was done. The credits state the video was made from a DVD. Obviously the engineer who made this conversion was more interested in the almighty dollar then in the ""quality"" of the product."
1,The Ghost of Thomas Kempe,"I work at a primary school and the children have been reading bits from The Ghost of Thomas Kempe. Wanted a copy for the children to watch but found this video really hard to get. Looked forward to it arriving but when I played it, there was a loud hissing noise in the background."
2,thin,"The paper was way too thin. It was thinner than standard 70lbs paper.I was disappointed because for the size I bought (A2), I was expecting a thicker paper than the regular fax paper. The product arrived on time and well packed."
4,dad loved it,I bought this for my dad for Christmass. We are big fans of the movie and he loved it. I am going to order the full size one for myself.
3,christmas story leg lamp,Item is just as pictured except it also has a night light feature i didnt know about. My daughter in law with the warped sense of humor loves it.
4,desk lamp,"love the lamp, super cute on my desk, bought it as a present for my boyfriend, the leg also lights up seperately. overal a fun kitchy lamp, great buy!"
4,Fun,It's just for fun and is great. Not a lot of light but had'nt expected it to put out much with just a 40w bulb.
5,perfect for the xmas story movie fanatic!,"this lamp is the perfect decor for the christmas story fanatic....loved it, and so did the recipients!"
4,Christmas Story Lamp,My husband's favorite movie is The Christmas Story...he loves the lamp!! I can't wait to see his face when he opens it!
4,great lamp but...,"This is a great lamp, but the packaging is wrong. It already has a pre-loaded internal small light bulb installed, yet the packaging says it you have to provide it yourself. Hope this saves the stess of taking it apart! You still have to install the regular 40 watt bulb"
3,My barrel is a lovely rust color,"I got the Blue Wonder Gun Black kit from blue wonder's website to blue my Traditions firearm pistol kit that I'm building. I followed the directions exactly, and put on quite a few layers as directed. Once complete the barrel looked beautiful, but a small amount of black was rubbing off the barrel already. A week later when I picked up the barrel my hand turned black. When I flipped it over I found the bottom side is turning an even rust color. I'm going to have to clean the barrel and start over with a different product.Update: The support portion of the website mentioned taking the finished barrel and lightly rubbing it down with steel wool. This solved the lovely rust color. Barrel looks good but it still rubs off a bit, which I expected."
2,A Great Disappointment,"I have read several reviews of this movie and they were all good. Since this type of movie, and subject, interests me, I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the movie was slow moving and quite boring. I've seen short clips on the catching of fish by hand that were more interesting than this. To me, the movie never had any momentum and was not that interesting. My recommendation would be to avoid it."
2,Neither aesthetically pleasing nor practical,"I don't own these, but from experience, can tell you that grass stains won't come out of white poly. Furthermore, as sports psychologists will tell you, white is a ""weak"" color; players wearing white wil tend to be less agressive, and will be perceived as less threatening by opponents."
5,A true depiction of the immigrant experience,"David Bezmozgis astutely describes the immigrant experience in this book of short stories linked through the same characters.The author's personal experiences, which parallel those of his characters, enable him to descriptively write scenes which come alive and appear real. As a Toronto secondary school teacher who has worked with Russian immigrant students, I recognize realistic scenarios in his stories and feel he has accurately portrayed the lives of these immigrants.A thoroughly enjoyable read!"
4,Jumping Frogs,"What a great little book. When I first rec'd it, it was small and I thought this isn't what I was looking for. Well size does not matter with this little jewel. Mark Twain was an excellent writer and it comes thru on every page of this book. His story telling draws you in and no one would be sorry to add this one to their collection!"
2,Five for hell isn't the half of it!!,This entire production should have gone to *ell in my estimation. It does however contain the necessary ingredients for a great comedy -too bad they didn't approach it from that angle...Wake me up when it's over!!
3,ok,"I don't know much about the product itself. This was a gift and I assume the receiver is now enjoying it tremendously. It took a lot of run-around to get the pack, but once I did receive it and my refund, I am satisfied."
3,"Interesting, but too many glaring errors","I borrowed this book from the library, and was impressed with some of the entries. I am learning about some movies and books that I'm now interested in renting or borrowing, but I've also learned to take the information in the entries with a grain of salt. As soon as I read his short bio on Ben Cortman from I Am Legend, I began scrutinizing the other entries. There was no war in I Am Legend, and it took place over a matter of YEARS, not evenings as the author states. I was very disappointed in this.On the other hand, I was happy to see so many current vampires included, such as Angel (although he made an error there too, Angel was not born on a Greek island, he was born in Ireland), and the inclusion of vampire hunters.All in all, I'd say this is a good reference if you don't take all the information as the last word on the subject. Other research is required."
3,"Who's Who, You Tell Me","Not an extensive collection like I hoped. I expected a multitude of unknown and a few popular vampire characters that have graced screens, tv and different books. Gordon, does great - giving a brief synopsis for each character, the role they played and the storyline to boot, but wastes paper going over many of the already known ones. Most of the persons mentioned were from a single book or series. Not very broad. This gives you a very limited look at only more successful characters that are the most popular in vampire fiction, and not enough selection.So unfortunately, this book didn't serve me a purpose but to brush up on a memory of some of the characters I already know. Someone else new to vamp genre could find it very good to start out with."
4,Reason you should read this book,"The reason you should read this book is because it is very interesting to read about what a soilder went through. He was in the beginning saying that ""I am not the best speller"" and stuff like that. But when you read further it gets more and more interesting and supensful(to me it was). If you are like me and like to read about war stuff. You will really enjoy this book. In this book you would read how he felt like and how miserable it was to be in this war. You would read the harship of what they went through in the Civil War of a Union soldier. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
5,i love this show!,this is such a fun and enjoyable show that i now own the whole series to date and watch them in the winter to keep me laughing through the cold.
1,What's With The Outrageous Price?,With nine less episodes in this season I would would have expected it to be priced accordingly. Does Amazon have any say in how items are priced? You couldn't go to bat for Bones fans and say this was priced way too high? I will not be purchasing for awhile.... I will wait for the price to come down to where it actually matches what you are getting.
3,Not as interesting as past seasons,"I was not very involved in any of the episodes. By involved, meaning, take eight to twelve hours and watch the entire season in one sitting, becuase I could not wait to see what occurred in the next episode. I found the plots predictable, the characters predictable, the resolutions predictable. I love the series, and have them all on DVD. Recommending you wait until the price goes down, then purchase. Not worth the full price I paid.And...what happened to all the episodes???? Far fewer amount in season 7. What the...?!?!?!?"
5,awesome Bones!!!!,"As always, good story, good characters, and just a feeling of family. Just love the honesty and care between characters."
4,Food and Snakes,Competetive eating in all its disgusting nature made the python look friendly. It was fascinating since I was not aware such exhibits ever happened. I never guessed the murderer.
4,Great show but seriously?!!,"I am a HUGE BONES fan and even though seasons 1-6 are available on Netflix, I have purchased them all. I will definitely be buying season 7 as well but the price is crazy. Understandably the season was short (13 episodes) due to Emily's pregnancy but to charge almost $40 for the season is ridiculous. I'll wait until the price goes down a bit I guess."
3,$45 for 13 Episodes????!!! Can you spell r-i-p-o-f-f?,"Enjoyable but horribly short season. Episodes good, nice new relationships and character development with the intro of a new home and baby. But the price is amazingly greedy even for a studio. Terrible but typical decision to bleed fans dry. Shameful"
4,Cheaper than Regression Therapy!,"If anyone had asked me about the toys profiled in this book I would have shrugged and said ""Never heard of them."" But after two minutes of browsing it's pages I spotted three of my favorite childhood sci-fi toys. I had completed forgotten these cool and bizarre toys that were so much fun for me as a kid. Well worth the money and a lot cheaper than regression therapy."
2,An okay read but nothing great,"Has some useful information in it, but most of it seemed like commonsense.I didn't really like it because it seemed to use only three films for most of the examples: Chinatown (which is way overused in screenwriting books and an easy answer to say this is what good writing looks like - yes it was a good movie, but it was made 30 years ago and would never sell in todays market), North By Northwest (again great film, but could you pick something that would sell in today's marketplace?) and Silence Of The Lambs (again amazing film, but also I think it's 15 years old - yes it may sell in today's marketplace, but could you not find a movie made in the last 5 years).I'm sure his seminars are great, but the book just seemed a little boring. It was way too redundant."
3,Also a little disappointed,"You'll like it if you want a 224 page checklist of ways to increase reader interest. I found much of it to be painfully obvious, such as:""We Like Characters With Desirable Qualities:Power, Charisma, Leadership-A glamorous profession-Courage-Passion-Skills/Expertise-Attractiveness-Wisdom,wit and cleverness-Sense of humor and playfulness-Childlike innocence or enthusiasm-Physicality and athleticism-Persistence-Misfit, rebel or eccentric-""Each of these categories is further explained, just in case you might not know what it means.A nice long checklist. Nothing new, if you already have a collection of screenwriting books."
5,Invaluable. A Keeper.,"This book goes beyond structure to the heart of your story or screenplay -- emotion. The book teaches you, component by component, how to touch your readers through emotion, and how to keep them turning the pages by incorporating suspense, tension, and anticipation. This is by far the best writing/screenwriting book I have ever read."
5,Great help to authors,Excellent resource for writers. This book provides practical and insightful advice for the aspiring writer as well as for more experienced authors. Highly recommend it.
4,Be aware of what you are buying! Ad is misleading.,"There's nothing really wrong with this product. It is mostly what I expected when I ordered it. But as someone else pointed out, Amazon is advertising the wrong device! The eTrex personal navigator is NOT color, does NOT have maps, and does NOT have a USB connection for your computer. To interface with your computer, you need to order a strange sideways looking cable that connects to a serial port. They have adapters from serial to USB, but the port on the device is not typical. I would suggest buying the device first and then ordering a cable.This is fine for a startup GPS device, specifically for geocaching. It's very simple. All it does is point you to your waypoint, which is great when Google Earth can't get you close enough. However, if you are expecting any mapping at all, you're looking at the wrong eTrex."
3,Alternate Activities,"I've purchased one and intend to use it this winter during snowmobiling trips. I've used it already, and found it to useful in almost any moving vehicle from a car to a plane. It does not have a ready map. But it will make one for you. Especially useful in an area where there is no map or markers to follow. It will keep track and like an unlimited supply of breadcrumbs will allow you to find your way back. And once you've created your own trails. It will allow you to find them over and over again."
2,"Good GPS System, but screen may get transparent.","Been using it for 6 months already, and everything worked perfectly, just like it had to work, but suddendly the screen started to get transparent... Don't know why, since it didn't felt-down, though it got a little bit wet with the rain when I was hunting (it says it has a Waterproof exterior), but no big deal. I'm still able to use it, but I have to make an effort with my eyes... so, planning to get a newer one."
3,It is a nice unit but has a couple of drawbacks.,"This is a good basic unit. It gives you a wealth of data, in fact more data than I could ever use like time of sunrise and sunset.My one criticism is that I have to take about an hour to retrain myself on how to use it between trips. There is nothing intuitive about it.Another thing I noticed about it is that if you are taking a curvey path to your destination and say your destination is 3.5 miles up the path, this will not provide you with the correct distance. I think it must measure more or less as the crow flies."
1,A toy,"I wanted something small and easy to use. Basically just keep track of my route while hiking in the woods so I could find my way back to the truck.This unit is slow, unreliable and has poor battery life.It's a neat toy if you are walking around in your yard.Save your money and buy a better model if you are really going to have to rely on it to find your way out of the woods.Oh, BTW, even the slightest canopy or cloud cover and you'll lose your signal."
5,Has got all you need,The only problem with this GPS is that waypoint names are limited to six characters
3,distance isn't right more than half the time,"Got the gps to measure my walk of 6 miles (5 days / week). I've used it 6 times and have gotten no 2 distances the same. These are as much as half a mile off. I can count steps or watch the time and get more acurate distances. The moving average is not right, nor is the max speed."
1,runners and joggers beware,"For hikers and fishers and hot air baloonists, this little unit may do the job at a reasonable price. For runners who are interested in recording time and distance in unfamiliar territory, this little unit yanks my big unit. It'll give you a running total time and distance and, for those who can't do division, an average speed. It will not save split times at waypoints nor measure the distance between waypoints on a saved ""track."" (It only measures straight-line distances betweeen waypoints.) I imagine that the Timex Ironman GPS watch system is a much better choice--but I'll never know because my buget's already broken."
4,"Bearpaw Womens Suede 8"" Boot - Style 405 Dream",I love them! Great in the snow! I live in Vermont and they work beautiful! Get one size up! I usually wear an 8 and I am so happy I got a 9. Colors don't match the pictures online. I ordered the Sand and it is a lot lighter than the picture but they darkened after I waterproofed them. Shipping takes longer than they say it will. The vendor didn't ship them when they promised they would so I didn't get them before Christmas like they said I would.
4,Nic e boots - sizing off,"These are nice shearling lined boots, not quite as cute as Uggs but more affordable. BUT order up a size. I am a standard 8 and my toes were squished up against the front."
4,Great price & Great look! BUT...,"I bought these for my daughter. Silly me, I didn't heed the warning to buy a bigger boot that I had read in the reviews here on this website. My daughter usually wears a 7.5 tennis shoe, so I bought the boots in an 8... WRONG! I am sending back today for a 9. WARNING, buy at least one size bigger than you typically buy in other shoes. These run terribly small."
2,Bit silly...,"Bought this more or less to check out an older Georgina Spelvin (star of The Devil In Miss Jones) in a legitimate role. Not really a heck of a lot going on in this flick. Suppose I'd categorize it best as a mildly-erotic psychological horror flick, but not a particularly good or enduring one. Pretty much one of those movies I'd already forgotten about within hours of seeing it. Spelvin is quite a ways past her prime here, so if one is buying this because she's in it, well...unless you have a thing for mature, disheveled-looking women, there may not be much here for you. Mildly amusing in a (low)b-grade movie kind of way."
1,Knock-Off/Jipp,"Should there not be recognition/RESPECT towards Master Tatsuo Shimabuku?(Not Shinshin-con)This is not the""FIRST""time this info has been released.Katas Seisan,Chinto,Kusanku,and Kusanku Sai(Major Katas) were not reviewed.Alot of basic technique were not covered.I held a higher opinion of George Alexander till his connection with this work.Now let me get back to pulling the Gold out of my Mothers teeth so I can start my own Karape World.Humbly Yours:J.R. Price"
3,eeh,Not to bad but for some reason i was expecting the ball to be a heavy metal ball instead its a very thin almost plastic feeling ball.
4,Decent Product,This product is decent but made out of light weight metal. Got it for a bosses day gift and he loved it. It is the 2013 Magic 8-Ball equivalent.
2,I am not really interested in Alan Walker's life,"It is largely a semi autobiogographic account of Alan Walker's life, which I am not concerned about, It does have some information on the Nariokotome Boy which I am very interested in.As such it held little that kept me interested."
1,BROKE,I bought one of these long ago. It sets in my tool box broken. It did not work very long before it broke. I use a http://www.amazon.com/Tools-912-Valve-Spring-Compressor/dp/B0002STSG2/ref=sr_1_32?s=automotive&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1338055039&sr;=1-32Mostly and it works as long as I have a stud to bolt it to.
5,Cool,"I really like this game! But the one thing I dont like is when you sometimes drop a bomb on someone, that person doesn't die. All the other stuff is OK"
4,GOOD SOLUTION,"ALTHOUGH I WOULD PREFER A SIZE SIMILAR TO 3X5 POSTCARD, THIS IS A BETTER PRODUCT THAN THE SMALL TENT CARD AND BETTER STOCK, TOO."
2,Not really for digital shooters,"I picked this up looking for a back-to-basics book only to find that the book doesn't really talk to a modern audience. It's very film-centric in ways that may not help people dealing with the very different choices offered by digital cameras -- that is, it's not going to give you much guidance for either taking digital snapshots or using more advanced technical controls. This really is a book from the early '90s with a 21st century gloss on it."
4,Great product -- but took almost 3 WEEKS to arrive,"Waited way too long to receive this. The lotion itself works very well, I was just frustrated that it took almost 3 weeks to show up."
1,$201 for shipping? Is that a joke?,"Who on earth would pay $201 for shipping of a plastic chair? And the weight is listed as 169.4 lbs?! If you're going to run a legit business, don't make a fool out of yourself on amazon."
3,FYI,"What many folks do not understand is that any kind of Furniture Shipping is among the highest regular fright rates. Some of the reasons are that it is usually bulky and requires special handling. For example, in many cases it is not stackable with other fright because of not ridged boxing or packageing and will damage easily (scratch, nick, tear and break). Some is made to order and very expensive to replace etc. The rates need to cover all this and more. This is one of the reasons why most Furniture Businesses run their own trucks with lift gates and, two men aboard. Hope this comment will help."
2,"Win some, lose some","Not at all what I thought it was. Waaaay too much money for some 'copied papers put in plastic spiral binder"". Too bad I can't return."
1,problem,"This toy may be somewhat fun once you get it going,but its way more trouble than its worth.You,ll spend a day just getting together the stuff that it don,t come with.Gas for the balloon $,strange battery $,double sided tape $.My balloon had a leak.I ,in the end had 150 in it for a day or two of use.After that i gave up."
1,Pulsar crap,This watch is a piece of junk. I would return it but I have had it to long so I will trash it. I went to check the time the other day and the face of the watch is so scratched up I could hardly see it. Never seen anything like this before. I have know idea what I could have done to cause this. Out of 20 watches I have had in my 63 years this is the first time this has happened to me.
3,It starts out fun!,I liked this game but after the frist level I started to find the game a little boring
2,Not sure why so many people like this one.,"I love my PSP. I've enjoyed every game I've played for it. Lumines, however, didn't live up to the hype and I just felt cheated.It's not as much fun as Tetris by any means: it's flashier, prettier, and has better music, but it just isn't as fun to play! I found the puzzles really easy until suddenly one was hard and there was nothing to do to try any others. So I got a tip from the internet for that puzzle and then suddenly they were easy ones again until I got bored and stopped. The endless mode got boring before it ever approached being tough...after about 30 minutes that too was boring.I finally sold mine. It's not a terrible game, and it may be just right for you, but I have to recommend trying before you buy."
1,it never arrived,"Can't say much about this product, because it was never delivered. My credit card was credited back after a week, with no explanation."
1,junior varsity,"This book is essentially a blah and plodding recital of events... exhibiting a verylimited ability to understand ideas. [e.g. Christianity's mysteries arebroadly labelled as ""irrational"" -- a sentiment most of us outgrew after the10th grade.] Couldn't finish it."
1,Awful,"Very biased...really not what I expected...I think I expected even-handed prose. Not a ""blame the West"" type book. Would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Facts and Bias,"I only made it through about half the book before I gave up. It is remarkably unpalatable and stunningly biased. After giving up, I wanted to see some of the amazon reviews, many of which I found echo my conclusion that Ms. Armstrong is an apologist of Islam. Nothing wrong with that, but she should be very clear about it and not present the book as a balanced history."
1,Are you kidding Armstrong?,"I would not have read this book if it wasn't for class. While the author does clearly state her thesis (multiple times), she does clearly make the connection between the Crusades and modern history. As a former-nun, she is very anti-Christian at the moment which impacts her ability to have a triple-vision, and is VERY biased towards the Muslims."
4,Video quality,There's not anything I can add to how great of a match this was. Just wanted to throw in here that the video quality is GREAT for a video from 1980! It certainly looks a lot clearer than anything I saw on TV back then with a rabbit ear antenna ;)
3,Not the best season but definitely a must have!!,"""Here's Lucy"" season five is probably the worst season of all of the series. Don't get me wrong, the season does have some hilarious plots and situations, but it also has some terrible plots. Some of the scripts are terribly poor like ""Lucy and Petula Clark,"" ""Lucy Is Really in a Pickle,"" ""Lucy and Jim Bailey,"" ""The Case of the Reckless Driver."" Also, I do not particularly like ""Dirty Gertie."" Lucille Ball actually broke her leg this season! So it was cool how they tied that into the stories, but some of the stories were just too bland. It is a must have for every Lucy fan!!"
1,Waste of Time,"This pathetic book is one cliche after another, dressed up in a bunch of psychiatric mumbo jumbo. The plot is highly unlikeley: a psychopathic serial killer engaged in a dialog in the New York Times with another shrink, who is working with the FBI to nab the killer. Once the plot is underway, you know exactly where it is going to go. There are no surprises here. No suspense. No organic plot development -- the author, when he senses that he needs to end the novel, just plunks down a few convenient coincidences and rushes to the conclusion. The characters are cardboard, although the author tries to make you believe that he is developing them -- giving them dimension, when all he's doing is putting fancy clothes on manniquins. And of course, the serial killer is a Christian religious nut (that seems to be a favored cliche these days). And the ending is simply silly. Save your money."
3,Vacuum,Power hose was damaged. Plastic screw set was broken so hose will not stand up right. Needed to fix it.
4,"Paper, binding","This is generally a good edition. The paper is very smooth making it difficult to turn pages in time. I have to crumple up each page to get enough traction to get them turned. Also the more I use it, some of the pages are beginning to come unbound. Coarser paper and sturdier binding would make this edition more practical for performance and not just as a study score."
5,"Very thorough, detailed, and complete","This book contains just about every obscure detail about JavaScript that you could possibly want. From its history, syntax, structure, operators, object hierarchy, methods, properties, etc..This book has what you're looking for.All of the tools available to you in order to spice up your webpages are thoroughly documented in this book. Once you go through this book, you'll know the ins and outs of anything related to client-side JavaScript.However, I wouldn't recommend this book to the absolute newcomer to JavaScript, especially one with no prior programming experience. Try something like JavaScript Goodies as an introduction. Once you're ready for all the nitty gritty details and to learn about JavaScript's complete (client-side) capabilities, this is what you're looking for. And of course, if you're interested in learning JavaScript, you should be comfortable with HTML."
4,Good book for someone with patience,"This is a great guide to how to write JavaScript! Not for the complete beginner, but it's still easy for the person who isn't an expert. You need to have patience, so if your one of those people who think you can learn a computer language overnight with one of those ""24 hour"" training books forget this book. Otherwise, if you really want to learn JavaScript and know the ""ins and outs"" of the language, this is for you."
3,Outdated indeed!,"Nice book, but definitely behind the times. IE5.5 goes way beyond what's here and due to AOL and Microsoft's hard work no other browser currently matters to real developers any more (even the last of the original Netscape developers conceded the browser wars quite some time ago). For a better reference try href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/"
3,still funny(ish) but terrible looking,I haven't watched a dvd that looked this bad for a long time - not sure if it is cheap work from whoever released it or if this was the best quality available to them.
5,Great book for newbies!,"If ur stepping into the building services industry, this book will be a comprehensive packaged info for your reading pleasure. Includes lotsa real-life diagrams, plan routings, concepts and explanation. It's 4am over here in Singapore and I've just finished reading one of the topics, just imagine how attractive the contents this book has! However, the only and regretable drawback is: the units are empirical which make it very difficult for me for in my country, we use SI metric units."
1,RA1186 DISCONTINUED,"I'm not happy at allI bought the RA1181 router table thinking I could order the RA1186 Plate.You can't .Now they offer a plastic piece of crap instead?Okay, I fail at research I guess. I had read in the manual onlineand new I'd have to order the plate which I had presumed I couldget from Bosch.It is my fault for trusting their manual for a current productthey sell that is NOT SUPPORTED . Optional items not available. SUcks to be you, customer and foolfor buying Bosch.Bosch as a company rates a zero with me as of this post."
2,A Gibson ripoff,"This book takes what made Neuromancer unique and turns it into cheap suspense. Its technical information is inaccurate, and by trying to stylize ""cyberspace,"" it creates a mess of illusion and reality intertwined around a predictable logical path. For all of its bluster about warning us of the dangers of cyberterror, it gives a simplistic view of the situation. As a suspense novel, it is not terrible, with a reasonably compelling character, but between the plot holes and predictability, it is about as suspenseful as reading The Congressional Record. Read Neuromancer instead."
2,Patrician II - CD Rom,"Hello Out There:If you have a job and work for a living this game is not for you. It has many qualities-realistic scenes, authentic schemes,interesting intrigues, many fun things-but you will spend the rest of your life catching on to any undergoing themes which could facilitate and make your playing the game, fun.For some it can be a ""highly"" challenging game. I'm not sure who they are.The game is intricately thought out and without a doubt, a jewel, if you can learn to memorize pages of information and critiquing before attempting the game. Have fun!"
3,"Unclear pictures, Odd Choices","Emberley has some odd pictures making this book a bit useless. Soup looks like a cheese wheel. Other food items like berries are recognizable, but not as clear as I feel they should be. Also, some items are a bit odd - like a radish - what child is eating radishes on a regular basis? There are alot of better choices for a child's book. I would likely not buy her books again."
4,all ya people that hate ygo are stupid,ygo is the best show around. this dvd is good its about the battle city finals where yugi duels the evil spirit of the ring. its one hard duel for yugi with bakuras ghost around to control 1 of his monsters and other stuff. dont miss this dvd order it early or wait when it comes out. Because im getting it.
2,Sucks for the most Part,This movie is nice if you want some really beautiful pictures and music. But it honestly doesn't teach you anything. I am the type that usually finds Something in a movie that is beneficial and I'm sorry but this movie doesn't have that. It's nice for background if you feel like playing a DVD in your living room and not really watching it except when you pass by.
4,Great Starter Book,This book is ideal if you have never started or dealt with Unix before. I encourage you to look into it if you do not aquire it. Sometimes it is more helpful than one thinks.
2,makin me laugh again,"that sure is a long review aint it. i wouldnt be surprised if someone from roll deep wrote it, or their promoter or sumthin. anyway this has like 2 good songs on it and features some awful crossover (read: sell out)moments on it. shame on westwood for tryna promote them."
3,How the Dragon Lost It's breath of Fire,The book is delightful to read and full of dialogue which brings Dragging Canoe to life. I was disappointed with the sketchy description of the battle of Buchanan's Station which was the turning point of the Cherokees as a main force in the area. The arrival of a large force driving off the Indians is not supported by other historic writers.
2,Disappointed,CD took almost 3 weeks to arrive. I was so excited to finally get it. Opened the package and CD case was in 2 pieces and face of case was cracked. Really bummed me out.
5,NFSU ROCKS!!,"NFSU (need for speed underground) is a great game. Yes your car may be slow in the beginning, but it just gets better. Graphics are awesome in color: the lights, neon bar, and even the asphalt looks good with it being wet. Modify your car to make it a 5 star reputation (the best). I havn't beat this game yet... but i am not discouraged (even though i lose every time) I highly recommend this game for people that like fast pace racing games!! TRUST ME!!!"
4,FUN FUN!!!,"This game is great!!! it isnt really like nfs hot pursuit 2 but it is great! u start out with a normal typical car that u c on the streets all the time but then u race for some $$$ and u can get great rims a tail bumper a front bumper a spoiler, viynels (stickers) hood designs, u can install nas when u get alot of cash and u can get alot of upgrades when u get alot of money buy this"
5,A Very Pleasant Surprise,"When I first learned that Diana was working on a new album which would primarily consist of old standards, I was disappointed and nervous as to the response it would receive. However, it seems my concerns were largely misplaced as Diana does a superb job with this material, so good in fact as to out class the original, at least in my opinion, on a number of the cuts. It is an amazingly good album both in the selection of the songs, and Diana's delivery.Based on the I Love You album, Diana remains a potent force on the music scene and it would seem that there are simply no limits on what she can accomplish when she commits to a project.Bravo Diana! Please keep it coming!"
3,Diana Ross makes an effort.,"Ross' 2006 release, ""I Love You"" had only UK/German/Japan releases slated for it. The US execs would rather just continue to milk her back catalogs at Motown and RCA. Too often, when Ross does have a US release, back issues piggy bank her current release. It is tragic how the old school divas (Aretha, Dionne, etc.) have to compete with themselves when they have new recordings out. The US release of this CD is seeing light on January 16, 2007!"
4,Ross at her best,"Ross' career spans an almost unbelievable fifty years, encompassing an ambitiously wide spectrum of music. It would be hard for her to please everyone in any single outing. On ""I Love You,"" as usual, she does it her way, with a selection of eclectic personal favorites not contrived to hit a marketing bull's eye. But as always you have to credit her integrity. And her voice has a quality that puts her at the peak of her career. Gone is the near hysterical edge of her early Motown years - perfect as that was for the time and material. In its place is assurance and a new depth of subtle richness. There are no vocal pyrotechnics here, no gimmicks. Just that ever clear Ross voice imbued with an experience and worldliness that has to be lived to be achieved. I haven't enjoyed Ross this much in decades. She has reached her personal best."
2,good but not great,"Can ""Miss Ross"" let someone else produce her albums? She made some all time greats in the past when someone else was producing. She has great talents, a good voice although it's aging, but that's fine. This album made me listen to it once, and sadly put it away."
2,Diana Ross in 'Stardust' mode,"Diana Ross is a living legend, and I think its amazing that she's still recording and selling out shows. But, when it comes to I Love You, even Diana Ross' die-hard fans may not like her very much. Diana Ross is better known for catchy pop songs, great ballads, and quite a few dance hits. This album doesn't contain any of the above. Its a collection of mostly really old songs that, according to her, were re-done by her to effect nostalgia. Well...I'm not feeling it, but if it works for her... I'm thinking that she could have come up with a much better production than this for what is very probably her last studio album. Not that there's anything bad about the songs she chose for this album but they just don't fit her style. She would have done better to re-record newer versions of some of her own hits from the past and a few new songs with a more cutting-edge producer."
5,A fabulous read for everybody,"You don't have to be involved with e-commerce and venture capitalists to love this book. Randall Stross is such an engrossing writer, he keeps you at the edge of your seat wondering which deals are going to be good. There is a lot about the eBay story here, and it's a great story.What really intrigued me is how short the list was for the CEO's Benchmark put into place before the companies went or attempted to go public and the amount of involvement they had with these start up companies.To me this is one of those books where truth is stranger than fiction. It reads like a novel, and I couldn't put it down."
2,Too good to be true,"I just don't get it. This book reads like a cheerleading exercise, not as a serious work of journalism. It helped me answer the question I had before I read the book: Why would any venture firm allow a reporter to enter its inner sanctum? Answer: Only when it probably knows ahead of time that the outcome will be positive."
1,Pheeeeew.,"Man oh man, did this book stink. It stank so bad that my dad called me up and asked me what smelled so bad, and he lives two towns over.I'd like to know how the author got paid for writing this drivel. Was it a straight advance, or did the fawning saps at Benchmark pay him in stock in their latest hot issue? Geeez Louise. I'd rather read a copy of the US tax code."
4,A good read with some good lessons,"I doubt ""eBoys"" was intended to read as a period piece, but it certainly does in the post-technology bubble world. There are a couple things that come across loud and clear: first, these venture capitalists were not blind to the bubble that was forming; second, if they wanted to stay alive and relevant in their field, they needed to keep financing new companies and unwillingly participate in furthering the bubble.The story is well-told and gives you an insider's view of how at least one venture capital firm makes the decision of who gets funding and who doesn't. It also serves as a cautionary tale about how even the most sophisticated investors get sucked into bubble mentality.A valuable read for investors, entreprenuers, and aspiring venture capitalists."
4,i have never forgotten this movie,the first thing i ever saw sally struthers in after all in the family...she was great...absoloutely. i have not forgotten how terrifying this movie was to me...and like i said i still think of it as far as being raped in your own home...that's why i bought it.i watched it with my mom...and just bought it. though surprised i found it anywhere...but glad i did...cause i want my daughter to watch it with me...
1,Worst doctor ever,"I had collegen injections in my face for acne scars. Went to dr. sandhu and he over did it,this was 1999 and soon I necrosis in my face even in areas where i didn't even have scars.His post operative care was horrible. All he did was record in taperecorder and never called me after that or provided any solution, I had to get scar revision done by other doctors, still I am doing fillers by other doctors which his incompetance hands destroyed my face. Never go to balding doctor with shakey hands and pure greed. He told me he chargesby cc and over did it. Worst plastic sugeon ever and now he is writing books."
3,pretty but a little small,"bought it as a birthday present for my best friend, sadly the fit was a little small ;( but she still loves it"
3,This One Is Just Okay,You get what you pay for. Definitely need to pair this one up with additional bracelets. This one is just okay.
2,Dull in appearance,Was very dissapointed in the overall look of the product. The silver was very dull ... clasp sticks - hard to open ... Not sure if I'm going to keep this ...
2,Picture's much better than the item!,I was totally disappointed when I received this bracelet. The photo makes it look like a very classy and quality item when in fact it's very thin and looks and feels very inexpensive. I probably will never wear it.
3,Mom likes it!,"This was a little gift I bought my Mother just because, two weeks ago.. It is ok... My Mother loves it and has not taken it off since I purchased it. Right now I am keeping an eye on luster. So far so good. I'll keep you posted."
3,Good only for room temperature applications,"This style label has a clear cover lay that delaminates in high temps (cars and boats get really hot when closed up in the summer sun. I use them only for non severe applications. I use Brady for all wire labeling now and the brother for panels. The characters are very precise and look great, just have to be careful where used."
5,A Great Read!,"If you enjoy historicals with strong characters and deeply moving plots. I highly recommend Gayle Wilson's novels!In this particular novel, the future Duke of Vail, Nick, and Mary (a country miss) is wed in secret - a ceremony they perform themselves but thankfully record in the old church register. Their marriage is consummated that eve just hours before Nick's honorbound departure to rejoin the war. Through the years Mary stays true to Nick and anxiously looks forward to his return...It took seven long years but he finally returned...battlescarred and terribly unhappy. Through a series of tear jerking scenes, Nick gains back the love of his life and as well as the son he never knew existed.This is one of those books I just couldn't put down!"
3,Not five stars; much less worthy,"While I liked the hero, Nick, the heroine Mary struck me as being a bit of a Miss Martyr, as well as not very bright. The heroine could tell from his looks that Traywick was a gross bully, and felt uncomfortable with him at first meeting (and all the characters in the book felt this way!). So why in heck would she end up giving him her son? It made no sense, no matter how ""desperate"" she was.I thought the main plot, of the two lovers separated by war and misunderstandings, was sweet enough, and I appreciated when Nick rescued Mary from her situation, but in the end there was nothing memorable about the book, except for Nick's ""disability"", which he ended up overcoming pretty easily anyway.For all that, this is not a very badly written romance, and contains some redeeming plot developments, but in the end it's too unbelievable, and the heroine's consistent TSTL moments don't add to its credibility. Just barely recommended."
2,Yes You CAN!,"This book reads like a satire of a self-help guru seminar. It is painful. I could not make it through. If you like worthless and feel-good anecdotes from a guy who butters readers up with sound-bites about the universal victimhood of the ""Big Lie"" and how we can all break free of that and learn ""The Craft"" with a kick start from our trusty mugs emblazoned with the word ""Writer"" (to remind and encourage us) and homemade mock-up of a future book cover with plenty of enthusiastic reviews (next to the glorious pin-up of Stephen King), this book will probably be a good how-to for you. I don't, so it's fortunate that there are all those other books that came before this one and from which Bell freely admits he's procured most of his tips. Also, this book is bluntly about selling, there's no conceit towards art."
5,Great book,I loved this book. I used it heavily when doing the outline and first draft of my book. Love a reference book that helps with the nuts and bolts of writing.
4,Great Overall Reference for Web Design,"It gives one the essence of what you need to know without superfluous language. As good as it is from that point of view, it is disappointingly slim on Javascript. If you want to learn Javascript, you will need a different book. It also is good about providing the necessary design principles for Web building. It should be on your shelf, if you are a serious Web author/designer/master."
5,Bravo!! What a great reference guide,"Clear explanations, numerous examples, and Jennifer writes in a fashion that is understandable and useful to all, from beginners to experts. Even my room-mate, who is a complete idiot, was able to grasp the material.Good Job, Jenn"
1,false packaging,This book is advertised by Amazon in a misleading way. This book is a dramatic adaptation of the novel by Elizabeth von Arnim and it is not the original work. Amazon's Web presentation of this book does NOT make that clear. So buyers beware.
1,enchanted crap.,"Had to get this for my inlaws college class. I have enjoyed plays in the past, but this was just terrible."
2,Somewhat outdated book.,"At the time when it's published, this book is definitely a good book. However, when more than ten years elapsed, and with the fast moving technologies, a lot of the book's content is outdated today. From this book, I do get some knowledge on GPIB, which is basic that will not change over the time. It is not very useful because of the outdate."
2,Not compatible,This product was not compatible with my Nextar P3 GPS. I would want amazon to do a better job describing the products. The only reason I purchased this item was that the description said it is compatible with Nextar GPS.Too bad I was fooled by you guys.
4,good tutorial,"This book is very comprehensive and covers everything aboutservlets. I like the author 's writing style. I don't know why somepeople say the examples don't compile. I downloaded the code andtried to compile them and they all compiled. You can also run the servlets from the website, so you can see that examples work."
4,Good start but not the whole picture,"This book taught me servlet programming. It's a very good book, however if you need to design a Web site, this is not enough. Information on sessions, requests and responses is good. The section on HTML generation can be ignored; if you insist on building an HTML tree one node at a time, just use an XML parser with HTML tags and attributes!To design a complete Web site, this book is outdated. Servlets are an important part of the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. You also want to look at either the JSP/JavaBean or servlet/XML/XSLT architecture. Therefore I recommend this book, plus _Web Development with Java Server Pages_ by Duane and Kolb, _Java and XML_ by McLaughlin and Loukides, and _XSLT Programmer's Reference_ by Michael Kay."
1,Save your money and read the API docs.,"This book did not teach me anything new! I downloaded the trial version of the Java Web server, looked at some of the sample servlets, read the API documentation, and then bought this book with the intent to learn more on the Servlet technology. Much to my surprise, I didn't learn a thing! The first couple of chapters feature a bunch of toy programs. There is also a file upload servlet, but the web server comes with one that is much shorter and easier to understand. Thanks, but no thanks, I'm returning it!"
1,O'Reilly books are going downhill fast,"The adage ""you can't go wrong with O'Reilly"" really took a hit after I picked up this dud. Don't waste your time, and pick up a copy of ""Developing Java Servlets"" by James Goodwill. Even the price is better!"
3,"ok book, not the best tutorial",I found this book to be semi helpful. It would have been nice if it was more tutorial like. The examples also were not the most straightforward. The book does cover alot though.
3,Servlet Beginners,"Hello Friends,This is a very nice and simple book for servlet beginners. Actually with out knowing any server technologies, I read this book. But I feel this is a good book to begin servlets and anybody can reach upto intermediate level.For advanced user, this is not that worth.A good book from O'Relly People."
4,Good to have on the shelf,Marty Hall's book is noticeably more useful and fun. Hunter belabors obscure topics like Virtual Path.
2,I expected more!,"The coverage on servlets was decent, not great. I was really disappointed with the coverage on the VIEW portion of the ""Model-View-Controller"" design. I understand that the author is not a big fan of JSP, but it's what most of us have to use whether we like it or not. So...once I got past Chapter 9, (there are 20 chapters), the book went down hill quickly."
2,Borish & Dated,"I am well versed in the areas that this book covers. The style in which this book was written seems terribly close to that used in industry mfg documentation, which I find too slow and scattered. Unfortunately I purchased it when the price was considerably higher. If you are looking for that edge, this is not it. If you want redundant reference material in your library, this one will do fine."
5,Great for pre-readers and beginning readers!,David McPhail's Fix-it! is a charming book. The illustrations are clear; the text is simple. It is good for pre-readers and beginning readers. The book promotes reading with your children.
4,The Power of Books,"I can see the charms of this book...a young bear gets up to watch TV only to find the TV isn't working. First her mother, then her father and finally a repairman try to fix it but by the time it's fixed, she no longer cares because she is happily reading a book. There is an enormous amount of data supporting the power of reading and it happens that in our own house the TV is rarely on so we found this book somewhat less compelling. The hardcover version has pictures on the title pages which add to the story - be aware that the board book may be lacking these (I haven't seen the board book so I don't know for sure)."
1,Acrylic Bagel Holder,"This product is useless. You have to hold the bagel holder with one hand and saw the bagel with the other. I say saw because the holder will not stay in one place, it slides all over the place and therefore the bagel is not cut evenly. I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially to seniors with arthritis."
1,WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I am VERY disapointed with this toy. It is impossable to get points. Because of this, the game is no fun to play. The old ones we had were great: You had a good chance to add points and it was more fun to play. My children stopped using this one the first week because it was so boring to play. Impossable to get a good hand and add points. Games like this should be a little easer to play, to make it more interesting and keep the childrens intrest. This one is a WASTE of money. Don't even consider purchasing it."
4,Wonderful Wickham Read,"Fleur Daxeny is a funeral crasher - she's a con artist who preys on recent wealthy widowers and makes off with some of their money. Her most recent victim is Richard Favour whose wife Emily has just died. However, what she doesn't count on is that Richard and his family may change her just as much as she changes them.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and the just over 300 pages seemed to turn themselves. While I felt that Fleur's past was perhaps a little glossed over and could have been brought out more and that there was some foreshadowing that's denouement fell a bit flat, I felt that overall this was a great read. I will definitely be reading more of Ms. Wickham's work!"
2,Unsatisfying ending,"It is the one of the few novels in which I do not see the growth and maturity of the main character. This woman is deceitful, a bad mother, and yet everyone falls in love with her. The author tries to convince the reader that Fleur is charming. This is a 40 year old woman that takes no responsibility for her actions and cares about noone but herself! The only good quality that she shows is that she is beautiful. If that is considered a quality than that is the only quality she posesses. I did not laugh or have a lot of fun reading this book. It made me feel really bad for every single one of these characters and even worse that they never got to see through the gold-digger that Fleur is. As far as they are concerned, at the end she is still wonderful. While the truth is... she never was and she never will be."
3,Entertaining,"It took me a little while to get into this story, but once I did I really enjoyed it. It is about a woman name Fleur who attends funerals attempting to find rich men to stay with for a while and eventually take some of their money and move on to the next. She finds a widowed man named Richard whose family had been in a sad, hurt routine by the silent hurt of the mother who had recently passed. Fleur takes the family and brings them all out of their shells and changing their dynamic for the better. There are a lot of unanswered questions and the ending is exactly what you'd expect, but it was a cute story."
5,Love it,"This writer never ceases to entertain me. All of her stories are different from each other, yet create a world you find yourself involved in."
1,inhumane,"Please do not torture your children. Send them to camp, maybe even camp in Arizona. Read a story about summer camp in Arizona. Let them watch Raising Arizona. Do not, however, rent or even think about buying this movie. It was only made because director Joey Travolta is John's brother; terrible is not a strong enough adjective. Bad acting, cheesy set-up, and unintentional moments of humor for those of drunken persuasion."
4,best to date,"While no controller has bested the gamecube one yet for comfort and ease.That being said, this is definitly the best xbox controller I've seen. Unlike the original xbox controller this one is easier to hold and it isn't ungainly and has no hard-to-reach buttons. the one change for the worse that I can find personally though is that the black and white buttons have been moved from above the main analog buttons (A, B, X, & Y) to below them. while some may consider this an improvement, I dislike for one main reason, that's that I am continually pressing the black and white buttons by accident as well as the a and b buttons."
3,XBox controller - standard,These controllers for the Xbox are to bulky for me. It doesn't fit snugglely in the palms of your hands like a PS2 or PS3 controller.
5,The Best XBOX Controller,This is simply the best XBox controller I've ever used. Period. Generic controllers look the same but have a completely different feel. Spend a couple extra bucks and get the real thing.
1,What Crap,This controler is too small. And it hard to hit the right button. The y is too far from the control stick.
4,xbox controller S-Black,"This is the controller that was an update to the ""original"" controller that proved to be too big for some people.This type of controller is easier to hold for those w/smaller hands or less cumbersome for others.I got this as a replacement to my old S-Black controller as one of my two dogs chewed through the cable wire that connects to the Xbox.Anybody that has an old xbox console knows about this type of player friendly controller and there is nothing I can say really to describe the feel of it.But if you need one for a replacement,I would buy a used one from Amazon b/c they are just as good as being new as described by the seller.The seller I purchased from sent me one that's good as new but alot cheaper and I have no complaints b/c it works just fine."
4,exactly as described,The controller came in a-1 condition. It arrived promptly and much sooner thanexpected. It was hooked up without problems. Works well on his xbox. Thank you.
1,Came with a missing part,Was not sent with the adapter needed to plug into an Xbox. This is NOT an Xbox 360 controller...it is for the regular Xbox and needs an additional plug for use.
2,too stiff therefore too damaging on my hand/thumb,"Now that McCormick sells their whole peppercorns in a pepper mill plastic jar, there is no reason for me to have this item."
3,pepper mill,"Expected this to work a lot easier, but I need to use both hands. Like the idea of pumping the mill instead of turning it. Very attractive."
4,Nice Solid Pepper Mill,"Saw this pepper mill is a resturant and was impressed by the design and functionality. Now that I have it for a while I am even more impressed. The one handed action makes it easy to grind. It produces a coarse grind, which is perfect for salads.Nice addition to the table. Soild feel and design."
3,It's small. I mean REALLY small,This thing cannot hold but maybe a tablespoon of peppers. have to admit it is very cool from a sort of James Bond perspective. I would expect 'ol 007 to smoothly pull one of these out of his tux after being presented with his meal in some exquisite restaurant.It is a very nicely machined bit of work and most pleasant to look at; functionally it does leave more than a bit to be desired.
5,elegant!,This pepper mill looks cool and elegant! I can hold on it with one hand to dispense pepper no problem. The down size is that it is small and has limited capacity (<2 tablespoonful of pepper) but not a big deal. The refill mechanism is easy. My wife loves the look of it.
3,Adequate,"Unfortunately, many of the guided relaxation CDs cannot be heard prior to purchased. This one is ok, but not that great. Her voice is ok but the imagery was not that good."
5,Too good to pass up...,"In regards to the revised edition of the book, it is an excellent one. I found the explanations clear and concise and I was able to apply all the examples I found in creating the tiny prototypes before designing the real application. It is an excellent introduction and grounding in Network Programming. The inclusion of JavaMail is also very helpful and allowed me to complete my program in record time. I hope he gets rich from this one alone!"
4,SOLID NETWORK PROGRAMMING INTRODUCTION,"This book is pretty complete as far as covering the fundamentals of java network programming is concerned.However, it provides not much more information than what the first edition covered.Most of the chapters seem the same, and some have been re arranged.Manning's book covers more topics,but this book gives better explanation of the concepts like RMI etc.Overall, a good addition to the shelf,but if you already have the first edition of this book, might want to consider Manning's book instead."
2,Not super impressed,"I don't know what all the hype is about. I didn't really like this shampoo. It doesn't lather at all, so it doesn't feel like it's doing it's job. No impressed at all."
1,Former user,This devise is no longer supported. The co went out of business and there are no servers available through which to send and receive E-Mail.
3,Very small watch,"I'm glad I didn't spend more for this watch. It's quite small, the strap is a bit skimpy, too. However, it does keep good time..which many other watches can do as well. I'm trying to be more careful when choosing another watch."
2,It is OK!,It is a very dry book and hard to stay interested in. I am barely able to stay awake while reading it. It does have some interesting things.
1,Meh...,"Timely arrival and very stylish, but arrived broken and price doesn't warrant repair. Such a shame becuz it is a very handsome watch."
5,My husband love this watch,I got this watch today before Valentine's day. My husband loves this watch he needed because the other one he had is broken and I replace the old one with the new one.
4,CLASSIC,If freesyle is your flavor this album is a must. You wont be sorry if you give it a listen!!
3,Where Yesterday Lives,"I love Karen Kingsbury; however, I did not enjoy this book as much as I have others. It is a good book, it just does not have the same feel as other Karen Kingsbury books."
1,Limited lifespan,"I purchased this item and enjoyed the clock function for about a year. Reception on the radio was never great, however, and after about two years the radio function died completely.Also, the ""self-setting"" function never really worked."
3,"one rah, two blah....","my review, short and sweet and to the point-The Krinard story was just interesting enough to be good, but I couldn't finish either the Lee or Vaughn story. Like another reviewer stated- both were boring and inplausible.My suggestion-save your money and get it from the library, or just skip it.3 stars for Krinard's story."
1,Already Dead!,"I just bought this battery on July 20th, probably didn't install it until about the end of July. Today on September 9th, it's already dead. So it basically lasted me about 1 month.....that's pretty bad considering the original lasted around 3 years."
1,very boring movie,"This movie was really boring and stupid. I tried to stay awake, but i keep falling asleep trying to watch this movie. This movie is crap !!!!"
2,Not Worth It,"I purchased this product in Sept 2004. I should have done my homework before buying however. Denon products tend to have more problems than many other well-known products. This DVD player was no exception. Within the first year my CD's and DVD's began to skip. Furthermore, the price is way too high for the features you get in this DVD player. You can purchase a Sony or Panasonic DVD player with similar features that is just over a third the price of this Denon and with much more reliability. No more Denon's for me!"
3,Surprisingly poor production values for O'Reilly,"Given my good experiences with O'Reilly books in the past, I was extremely surprised by the very *poor* production values in this book.I can't figure out what parts go into the robots based on the pictures which are too dark and poorly focused.A much better book with great pictures is ""Dave Baum's Definitive Guide To Lego Mindstorms"" which is also less choppy and I think explains things better."
3,This book is ALMOST a great book,"After purchasing The Unofficial Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS Robots by Jonathan B. Knudsen, I was very excited about working on each project in the book. Then I continued to read and found myself getting disappointed with the terrible photos, less then detailed descriptions, and easy working robots. I though this book was going to blow me away with new robots creations but it fell short. For the price I paid I expected more, more robots, more information, more of everything. I have to admit, the information on the different O/S's are great but tying to get them to work was hell. It was better than 3 stars but not by much. Buy this book if you want more info on programs, but look on the web if you want more robot creations."
4,Entertaining and Informative?,Entertaining. Informative? Sensationalized? No matter which way you look at it this movie tells a tale of people who struggle with addictions and watch their lives go down the tubes because of it. Four stars.
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a good crash course in Spanish for health workers but this was a disappointment. Spends too much space on basic grammar, sentences you will never use (""Pepe has a short pencil"" ""The pencil of Pepe is short"") and not enough space teaching phrases and sentences you really need to communicate with your spanish speaking patients. Remember those absurd language courses with their stilted dialogues? This is more of the same. For a much better course, try ""essential spanish for health care"" by Living Languages"" That contains plenty that you can use immediately."
2,Out of Date Book!,"This book needs an updating. It was written in 1985 I believe. Alot of things have changed since then, so the book is not totally accurate. It definitely is not up with the times.The book shipped to me was so old, the pages started falling out shortly after I started reading it. I ended up taking it to staples and getting it spiral bound. That is way more handy.There is however helpful information to be taken from this book, so it was not a total waste.In retrospect I would say try the painting manual by Dennis Gleason. It was atleast written more recently (1999). It would be worth a try."
1,Very vey long and annoying,"It s true,it really reveals the true Romanian system,but this movie is nothing but comic! Long and boring and annoying......"
2,Can't say yet,"Well, I stayed up late to watch this the first time and that was a mistake. My Romanian is not very advanced so I had to read the subtitles. I fell asleep not too far in. I guess this is a movie for someone who likes movies to have a ""real-life"" pace.... real life is pretty slow sometimes. The acting was quite good.... but again... I prefer movies to be somewhat entertaining and not just real.... I probably slept too long to glean anything more than this: that the last few hours of life can be kinda ordinary.I've just read all the above reviews and I guess I should rewatch it... I doubt anyone will get this far and not realize that it was the intent of the director to make an uber-realistic movie. This time, I'll start watching it much earlier."
5,New to conduits - thats the book you might want to buy,"This is a great book regarding to conduits. It explains some of the tricky things every single person has been through working with conduits for the very first time. The examples are good, maybe the authors could have spend a little more time developing clearer ways to explain them. But don't let it stop you. With a little bit effort and good C knowledge, you get there. There are also some chapters devoted to palm apps, which, I thought are not that bad. Anyway,if you're planning to write conduits, make sure to visit Palm's website and have this book around."
4,Beautiful but louder than expected,"This is probably the prettiest air conditioner I've seen, with it's low profile and sleek design. But it seems noisier than advertised, although that may be because it's in a small bedroom near the bed. I like the different settings, and use the fan setting a lot on cooler days (the fan has three speeds). One excellent feature is that it comes with a metal bracket you attach to the sill. The air conditioner sits on this bracket, so if you open the window, the air conditioner won't fall out! All in all, it's an excellent product for the money."
4,An inside glimpse into an major event in Hemingway's life,"Although this is being published as a tie-in to the movie, this 1991 volume has true scholarly merit. The 18-year-old Hemingway met and fell in live with nurse Agnes Von Kurosky in the Red Cross hospital in Milan while recuperating from wounds inflicted at the Italian front during World War I. Their alleged affair was the basis for his novel ""A Farewell to Arms"" in which she appeared as Catherine Barkeley. She eventually jilted him, and he later killed her in his novel. Included here are sections from her private diary from the time that Hemingway was her patient as well as her letters to him. A remembrance by fellow patient Henry Villard and an essay by Hemingway scholar James Nagel add to the proceedings. This volume offers fascinating firsthand information on one of the most important events in Hemingway's life. --Michael Roger"
4,Heavy as hell,"Thick even death. Gives a feeling of a refined better version of old Morbid Angel. Being a swede it is easy to compare Droid with early In Flames and Dark Tranquility, although at a some what slower pace, keeping the force and the feeling of being angry."
2,Weak Feel Good,"Weak story, tries to be ""feel Good"" buy just feels tired.I like Corbin Bermsen , I hope future efforts provide nore suspense"
5,An Inspirational Movie,"Two words can best describe this movie and the Christian faith that it represents: ""self-sacrifice"". I would strongly recommend it."
5,Be Prepared,"I don't usually like to watch Corbin Burnson but I am really happy I watched this movie! Yes, it is a Christian movie, but the message was a great one ""Don't Assume"". My 4 kids can tell anyone they heard this all the time when they were growing up. Because I liked it, I am buying a copy today. It definately is not a waste of time. BTW, wait for the sermon, near the end of the movie, it was a stand-up and cheer moment!"
3,Magic School Bus,"I like these books, but they are more for fun. I purchased this particular one as a aid for our health class but it did not give as much information as I would like. I think the Magic School Bus shows are much more informative than the books, but that is just my opinion as a home school Mom. If you are home schooling and just want some aids for class they are good but I would look at the Children's Encyclopedia series if you are teaching your children and really want to get their attention. They are fantastic. I still love these and love to see that my children are reading these books..their layout is really appealing and they are still learning!!!"
1,6 pages of information spread over 350 pages,"As my title implies, I was not thrilled with ""Learning Perl/Tk"". I learned more about Tk from ""Perl, The Black Book"" (Holzner) then I did from this book. The lack of helpful examples is astounding. I would not recommend it to anyone. In fact, I've just ordered ""Graphical Applications with Tcl & Tk"" (Foster-Johnson, OOP) and I am looking forward to finally learning Tk."
2,"Poor editing, weak descrip. of methods, no complete examples","The discussion of most widgets starts with what looks like a cut-n-paste block of text describing (again and again) the options. How many times does one need to be told that -foreground sets the color of the text? This builds bulk (pages) but doesn't add value.The treatment of methods is scatter-shot at best with very little information provided.No significant example __anywhere__ (eg, a simple addressbook app)."
4,a pleasant introduction,"This is a great intro to perl/Tk: the examples are plentiful and cover a lot of ground; the organization is intuitive; and the writing is pretty good throughout. Yes, its examples aren't seriously in-depth, and yes, most readers probably will outgrow this book fairly rapidly, but isn't that the sign of a good beginner's ""how-to"" book?"
1,"Colby TF-DVD5303.5""TFT Portable DVD/CD/MP3 player with built in stereo spkrs.",This player does not even work. It would not play any MP3 discs and now it won't play DVD disks. This is the worst product I have ever purchased!
2,no power head.,"pretty decent amperage, cant plug into any bedroom circuit that is also powering anything else or ill blow it. no power head makes this thing pretty useless for me.perhaps this is my fault for not paying enough attention to the description but i couldnt even imagine a ~$200 vac without a self-propelled head. it has a very light hollowish plastic head and its horrible.2 stars may be a little low since, actually, it is really well built but i cant stand it."
1,What a sad waste of money,"We bought this TV about 3 years ago from Sears. The pic was fabulous and we were fairly happy with it even though we thought the price was excessive. Last year (just after the warranty expired) we had to have a tube (?) replaced to the tune of almost $500. We really debated over spending the money or buying a new TV. Since we had such a significant investment, we decided to repair it. Imagine our chagrin when the same thing happened again this year. So needless to say, we bought a Vizio last night and hope that we have much better luck with it."
1,It's a Lemon,This Toshiba plasma TV is simply a Lemon. Mine worked for only 3 years and had major component failure's. Once upon a time Toshiba made high quality electronics. Another turkey I bought recently from Toshiba was the HD DVD player which they discontinued making . My advise to you is make yourself happy buy a different brand.
5,Diaspora below the Mason- Dixon,"A wonderful tale that had me captivated from the first page. Whether you're Jewish, southern or just an appreciative reader... the descriptive flow of this tale is unparalleled.Cohen writes an excellent tale that weaves the stories of his immigrant grandparents into the time of his owning ""bringing up"" and struggle with his ethnicity, spiritual and regional. The characters are interesting and personal. The descriptions of the region and of the family scenes create clear mental pictures.This is a book that I intend to add to my own collection."
1,Cyrano Seriously Sorry,"With a leading man who can't sing, lyrics that are no better than the title of this review and a score that is like paint by numbers, ""Cyrano"" is as great a musical as were the Emperor's New Clothes. I saw this show and was bored and appalled that it was even considered a musical. I saw Cyrano at the Palace Theatre where I also saw Yul Brynner in ""Home, Sweet Homer."" The two shows should play on adouble-bill--The Demise of the Broadway Musical."
3,NOT SO GOOD!,"I got three of this HDNet Fights dvds, all were in poor video condition. The dvd looks like a bootleg and the video looks like one. None of the matches are worth viewing twice. No big knock outs or subs. Checked out the main event on youtube. I have seen a lot better from Melendez and Thomson on other matches.TO: TROY,(SECOND REVIEW) I give three stars due to the fights not being so good. Even though it was recorded on a DVR system dose not mean the picture needed to be in such bad condition. I have bought movies from amazon which were stated to be recorded from a DVR, which looked a lot better than this tape. Even if the picture was in HD, would not make this any more than three stars."
1,Such a disappointment!,"I bought over the years all the seasons of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND on DVD and I loved the show, but I must say that this last one was a real disappointment to me. Maybe I expected too much, but other shows like FRIENDS had a really great finale, so why was this one so boring?! At least let Amy get pregnant or add any other ""surprise"". In my opinion, paying that kind of money for a boring finale and the pilot that I anyway bought years ago was a real waste. Sorry..."
1,What a Let Down,With such a great production team you'd think they could have come up with a great finale. But what a let down...
3,Disappointed,"We weren't expecting it to be the same as the one from the season. We thought it was in addition to the episode from the series. Other that that, it played well and is a DVD."
3,"Good, But There Are A (Very) Few Better Books.","I thought Lynch's book was a good one for the beginning investor. If I had to choose only one book on investing though, I'd pick Mary Buffett's ""Buffettology"" instead."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK!!!,"This book came in a tiny format, and was so general in it's description it did nothing to enlighten me on the stock market. It took all of about 10 minutes to read. I have read longer internet stock picks. I am a beginner so it wouldn't have taken much to teach me anything. Yes, I have a degree in business, but my focus in college was not on investing so I still have much to learn. This book did nothing to satisfy my hunger for knowledge. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Started but did not finish it,"Peter Lynch is a great investor, but his book was difficult for me to get into. I made it to about page 50 and just lost interest in the book."
5,A timeless tome,"This was the 6th book on investing that I bought and read this year. I had avoided it - despite its reputation - because I thought that a book that was first written in 1989 would be so outdated that its usefulness would be questionable. I was wrong. Lynch provides plenty of great teaching and advice in this book, and his writing style is both friendly, easy to understand, and interspersed with just the right amount of humor. The only comment I would make about the difference between 1989 and 2012 is that Lynch in several places would tell you where to get information on stocks - usually Value Line. But I now get this same information free from Yahoo Finance as well as the 2 brokerages that I use: Vanguard and Fidelity. That's just about the only thing that is out of date in this book, so 5 stars from me."
4,Old but excellent material,"I give it 4 stars because it is not a new book and some material no longer applies, but overall it is an excellent book to read. Even some of the situations that Peter covers in this book apply to today's financial state of the economy.I am new on investing and found this book an excellent resource. Buy it!"
2,"Better than ""Excalibur Hearts""...","Clunky!! And it always passes to the right. However, it does play a far more competitive game than Excalibur Hearts, which was low novice level. Still waiting for the ultimate, complete Hearts machine."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Jeeze, Warren Ellis sure seems like a big Superman fan. Now introducing his second analogue of the character in the form of Apollo (the first being ""The High""), as well as a pastiche of the entire Justice League.At any rate, the story is mildly interesting, though disturbingly anti-climactic. After drumming up the Apollo/Midnighter duo, they're defeated by... talking? How disappointing is that?The second story, introducing the multiverse concept, begs the question, who cares? Stormwatch taps into an alternate reality, and get all anxious about what happens next. They don't do anything and the plot resolves itself. The characters feel a little guilty, but in the end, who cares? Not me.Ellis fans should love this one. But I'm not an Ellis fan. Not after this."
5,What a great read!,"I am slways on the look out for a book that can successfully blend a good mystery with humor and a touch of romance. This book hits a home run in all those areas. The cover alone was enough to catch my eye, but what lies between the covers is a fun, fast-paced read that introduces us to amateur sleuth Jaine Austin. Jaine is great and her perspective on life, love, food and the LA scene will keep you laughing while you go with her on a journey to find out whodunit. As is the sign with a book you really enjoy, I was glad to reach the end of the book, and yet sorry that it was over. This is definitely a keeper and, I hope only the first book in what promises to be a very promising series."
2,This Pen For Hire,Was very predictable and a bit on the edge for comments made. Won't buy another. Was recommended by a friend.
2,"Needs editing, more structure and substance",Given Shiller's reputation as an academic who has studied financial markets for a long time I expected the book to provide substance to the notion that what we are seeing is irrational exhuberance in the stock market. What we get is a book that gives some broad ideas without enough structure and well thought explanations. Introducing insights from behavioral finance and psychology is innovative but the author does not even provide a coherent explanation of the role they play. I would wait to read a second edition once somebody has made a thorough editorial check. I was basically disappointed. I expected more than I got and paid for.
1,Irritated!,"Because ION TV took over for CBS 1/2 way through Season 4, only the first half of the Season is in this DVD set. You only get what CBS aired. Total ripoff and I'd really like Amazon to provide a reimbursment. This is bull."
1,not the full season,"Although Amazon is selling this dvd as Season 4, in fact it does not contain all of the episodes. Several other reviewers have mentioned this fact. You may have to buy this dvd and then another one at a later time that contains the rest of the episodes. Just don't be disappointed when you realize it's not the full season. I have previously watched the episodes on Netflix and if you are a fan of Flashpoint you will be happy with this dvd."
2,Well a proper description would have been nice!,"Been waiting for this for weeks, finally came today - early as usual which is great, never have a problem getting this from Amazon. Shame the product description is CRAP - it is cleary advertised as season 4, there are only 7 episodes of the 18 episodes for season 4. The rest are season 3. Guess sending it back is pointless since I had to open the pack to see what was inside and then you cant return it. These disks only go up to Shockwave."
2,Very annoying,"My rating is not about the show itself, it's outstanding, but of the dvd-content.The content is HALF a season, not the full season 4. They could have listed it as season 4, disc 1 or something. Would have left people far less disappointed. Pretty much a case of a deceptively wrong table of ocntent."
1,"4th season, 3rd season","I purchased the CTV version (as opposed to the CBS) season 3 recently, the outside of the package said ""complete"" 3rd season, this came from Canada, but there are only 13 episodes on it as well. It used to be that you would get the entire season from amazon.ca, but it just arrived and unless there were only 13 episodes for season 3, CTV's version is also only putting out half the season. I don't get the show any other way now. CBS only showed a few of the episodes, and now that it's on ION, I don't get to see it at all. Stinks that we're only getting partial seasons from the distributor. I also would love to see the entire season. I won't even bother with season 4 if I'm only going to get half the season."
4,flashpoint is awesome,"this is a great show and episode, well they all are. ive seen every episode there is, just waiting for more"
4,Where are the missing episodes???,I am so angry!! Why does the DVD set only contain 13 of the 24 episodes. I feel totally ripped off!!!
3,NOT the full season,"Amazon should include ""ONLY 13 Episodes"" in the description!! WHERE ARE ALL THE EPISODES????? Love the show but very disappointed 11 episodes are not included! Flashpoint will end with season 5. The question is will it be packaged as the true season 5 or..."
4,camelbak Unbottle 100Oz size,"The 100oz is great for hydration, with the clips it can be secured with straps or the clips snap open so you can attach them to existing straps on a pack. I use this mainly for over night trips, It is kind of bulky and heavy for hiking long distances, if your just going out for an afternoon or want a lighter alternative I would recomend the smaller version.This hydration pack is very durable and easily mounts to whatever hardware you need to get it onto. with many upgrades/attachments available this is a very versatile hydration option and doesnt have the extra bulk the hydration backpacks do."
5,Memorable.,"The Victors is yet another great book by Ambrose. I had just finished reading the new WWII novel, The Triumph and the Glory, when I heard about this book and I bought a copy right away. I prefer fiction because of its range of potential to present ultimate truths, but Ambrose writes so well I can never pass up one of his fine books."
5,overall pleasing,"Now admittedly and quite obviously this book covers much of what his other books, D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, covers. This may or may not be a good thing. One main difference is that in The Victors the book goes chronologically like the others; however, The Victors is not focused on the timeline of events. For example there is a section for each of the two American landing beaches at D-Day, and then there is a section for Hedgerows; neither of the sections are certain dates or times. I personally love reading WWII books so I do not believe that the repetitions are superfluous, as other casual readers may. In my opinion, it is a very well-written and truly great book."
3,Ambrose is always good,"Although Ambrose is always good, this is not his best. It is interesting and tells the story of the American GI under Eisenhower's command, but leaves something to be desired.We've been spoiled by Mr. Ambrose previous works and so this book lacks the full spectrum approach we've come to enjoy.Having said all of this, I will add that I was captivated by the personal stories of heroism and courage. While driving, I found myself fixed on the stories and nearly missed an exit!My greatest criticism for this audio book is Cotter Smith's reading of it. He is focussed and clear, but seems to miss opportunities for inflection and tone that would enhance the reading of this work.Listen, but realize other Ambrose works are much better."
2,Not necessarily a good bang for the buck,"While the booklet appears to be interesting in giving some history of surnames and regions from the 15th and 16th centuries, it is disappointing in only providing surnames of a census and no other information. The booklet has a list of researchers and surnames they are researching, but no way of contacting these folks in hopes of a connection. Some of the information in the booklet can be found on the internet at no cost. Seriously think twice before shelling out the $25."
5,A Fine Addition Any Xenakis Collection,"This is the third installment of ""works for orchestra"" on the Timpani label. Arturo Tamayo seems to have made it his personal goal to document many previously unrecorded works by Xenakis. There are four works on this disc, each one a marvelous addition to the body of Xenakis recordings. All of the composer's characteristic gestures are here: mass glissandi, violent rhythms, microtonal clusters. A very fine recording of excellent compositions by a 20th Century master. Worth many listens!"
2,too thick and messy / use spray fixative instead,"I was creating some sound control panels using Auralex studiofoam.I created 3 panels using the Tubtak, and 3 panels using the spray fixative.The Tubtak was too thick, it broke one of my caulk guns. Its messy also andtook some effort to put enough on each panel ( 2 x 6 feet ). The spray fixativeon the other hand was easy to use ( just use newspaper for overspray protection ).Just make sure the spray fixative you're using is safe for foam that youare installing."
4,Get away from it all,"From time to time, a little escapism into some interesting places is like a tonic. Watch Bear Grylls' athletic adventures, eat some bugs, make a refuge — all in spectacular scenery. Escape!"
5,Ralph Ellison: Emergence of a Genius,"This is the most detailed look at Ellison's life that I've seen. This biography covers his path from poverty in Oklahoma to becoming part of the literary elite in the early 1950's. The author examines Ellison's involvement in the black rights movement and his relationships with Langston Hughes and Richard Wright. From start to finish, this is a fascinating read."
2,Mediocre at best,"Being a mexican-american myself, I bought this book hoping this would be another gem of a book lending insight into the mexican-american experience, or any experiece for that matter. But this thin little book is a disappointment. The short stories are wrought with a bitterness and hostility towards anyone who crosses the narrator's path. Serros' tries too hard to convey her narrators as victims -- I even know that you don't have to be a chicana to have family members discourage you early on from becoming what you want to be when you grow up, which seems to be a central theme in her book -- that people in her youth kept holding her back. This theme gets really old really quickly. Serros should have stuck to her more humorous side than to resort to the whining and self-pity."
5,Hilarious! Quick paced read!,"This author has captured me! She keeps you turning the pages and I found myself laughing out loud quite often, as people looked oddly at me. Loved it!"
4,many a sleepless nights with this,"This book kept me on the edge of my seat for days on end. Stephen King surely is one of the best writers of our time. Although it wasn't as gripping as some other of his novels, it surely is a keeper for all times to come. I'd recommend this book to avid readers of Mr. King as well as first time King beginners. Keep up the good work Sparky."
5,Could not put it down!,I bought the book before we went on vacation and was glad I did. I Pretty much read non-stop for two days until I finished late the second night. Definitely kept my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat. I was actually sad that I finished the book. Stephen King is bright and witty and it comes through in his work. Great job!
4,A True Roller Coaster,"This story resembles the classic roller coaster ride. It starts out slow making the reader wonder if it is worth the effort. It then pulls us gradually upward keeping us guessing when the thrill is going to happen. As soon as we are at the top we realize we are in for a ride. Quickly we plummet through twists and turns, enjoying every minute of it until we come to a satisfactory conclusion. My only criticism is that it takes a long time to get to the top."
4,King's talent for suspense allows you to overlook the slo,"S.K. is an awesome writer! After reading his books I always have a lingering feeling and find myself thinking of the characters long after the book is finished. This book was written in a different style than I am used to seeing in King's books. It was far from boring, but not quite fulfilling. I read the book quickly; it held my interest although I often felt annoyed at the emotionally unstable protagonist. Bag of Bones was a good read, but it lacked the unexplainable feeling I enjoy after finishing a Steven King book."
1,A throw away Stephen King book.,"The beginning of this long story held some promise for me of exciting moments ahead. As I read on, I began to think I was into some time-warp mix of all the ghost stories I have heard and read. The worse part is that I became bored and not very interested in what happened to the characters. I am and continue to be a Stephen King fan, but this book was left in the airport for those people who will read anything waiting for their flight to take off."
2,"Not bad, but boring","This book just moves too slowly to be entertaining. The ""frights"" are almost non-existent, and it really stretches credulity that he sees the ghosts moving magnets around on his refrigerator, then just goes back to working! Repeatedly in the book he'll end a chapter saying something along the lines of ""then all hell broke loose."" Then instead of all hell breaking loose, he goes back to working.I must say that the book IS a page-turner. I wanted to know what was going on, what would happen, but there are two kinds of page-turner. Ones that are exciting, and ones that are like Chinese water torture--where you turn the pages because you keep telling yourself SOMETHING will happen soon! This book unfortunately is the latter.This book is not literary, the writing isn't great. It's not bad, by any means, but it is just 528 pages of blah."
2,It lacked substance and excitement,"I am normally a big fan of King. However, I was not very fond of ""Bag of Bones"". It took 560 pages to tell a short story. The book lacked that certain fire that King normally has which prevents a person from putting down the book. The plot was so slow and mundane that I would put the Book down for weeks and not missing a thing when I picked it back up. This is certainly not characteristic of Mr. King's Novels."
5,superb,"Out of all the books I have happily read by Stephen King, this is my ultimate favorite! When I cannot put a book down to make dinner etc. I know it has captured my interest. I highly recommend it...."
2,This novel dragged like the proverbial BAG of Bones,"It was the most boring King book I have ever read. I vowed to stop reading after the ridiculous plot of Rose Madder, however I got sucked back in with the promise of a love story and a new direction for King. But, I plodded through thinking when is this story going to get interesting. I never did. He was also way off the mark for romance. (blah,blah,blah) many others agree."
2,Disappointing. King can do better.,"Sub-standard King. Pace is slow, payoff is disappointing. Not at all near his usual standards. Too bad, because he is a great storyteller. Skip this one."
5,STEPHEN KING RULES!!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's got a great plot, and it's spooky too. It's one of those books you don't wanna read alone. It's totally freaky. It's great. Everyone go read it. :)"
5,A haunting love story,"King explores new territory with this book. He crafts each word and scenario and takes you to on a journey which will not be forgotten. A sad and haunting book which evokes feelings from deep within. Don't read the book, be it. King makes it easy."
3,Unbalanced new style,"The first half of this tomb is wonderful. But the second halfof this book got so boring, with too many unimportant description anda very loose ending. Mr. King is obvious struggling in this book. He wants to change his stereotype mass-product stories but the new style has not fully ripen yet. I am waiting for his next book."
2,"Not that great, Stephen.","This book is definately one I couldn't place on my top Stephen King books. It just wasn't up to standards. It had everything a good Stephen King book has (a few murders, a few dead spirits that won't stay dead, a few evil beings, etc.), but it wasn't put together well. I found it difficult to understand. There were times during the book I just wanted to close those few chapters into darkness and take it back to the library. I didn't, hoping that the next scene would bring back the old Stephen King, but my wish was never fulfilled. I just pray his next book isn't anything like BAG OF BONES."
3,"Good read, but don't expect too much at the end","This was a good read, but I expected to have more horror factor. I do like how he brings and connect his characters and places from his other books. I hoped for a little bit more suspense. Not a bad story."
3,Doesn't Leave You Feeling Wonderful,"I started reading Stephen King in college with Pet Semetary. I recently completed his 11/22/63, which was so compelling that I read it twice. I also bought and finished The Stand, which was long but plenty interesting. Thinking all King novels were this riveting, I purchased Bag of Bones and The Long Walk. Bag of Bones was an interesting story, but there were parts of it that seemed surreal, and strained credibility. Not the parts were ghosts manifest, mind you, but places were people behave in unbelievable ways in order to further the story. I know that stories with angry ghosts, and where people die are not meant to be pleasant, but Bag of Bones left me with a disagreeable feeling. I would recommend the other King books that I mentioned ahead of this one."
5,Couldn't put it down!!!!!!,"I kept waiting for a lull in the story so I could put it down and go to bed, but I ended up staying awake half the night to finish it! I HAD to find out who was in the house and why they were there. The ending was worth the wait."
5,It was a really good book.,Bag of Bones was an extremely suspenseful book. I really enjoyed the way that I was kept in suspense! Stephen King is my favorite author. I reccomend this book to anyone!
4,A real gem,"This book was mature and well-written, with an attention to detail unique to Steven King. His ability to capture nuance is unparalleled.There were so many random images and ""loose ends"" in this novel making it difficult to see how they were all going to fit together, but by the end it all made perfect sense. This is a writer who has so much craftsmanship at this point in his career, it's just a pleasure to read, following him into the dark and knowing that there will be gratification at the other end."
1,Still a Stephen King Fan...,"I'm young (20) & not a professional book critic, but I have read several King books (Misery, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Needful Things, etc.) & I must say Bag of Bones was my LEAST favorite. The supernatural played a large part & that didn't bother me until the last 150 pgs or so when it then began to seem very silly. The book just never really grabbed me, but I stuck with it & kept reading thinking it would speed up & get interesting... It never did for me. I still remain a huge King fan, but this particular book fell flat."
2,OVER-long tedious and predictable.........,ok this book is typical and predictable though it does have its moments of shock...but the shock stuff isnt strong enought to blow me away.......first of all the book is tooo long.......and the ending is a bit stupid actually........the bag of bones--------the name itself gives away some of the story......SPOILERS******************and how KING makesthe CRAZY DAUGHTER the VILLIAN is just so stupid.......out of nowhere she pops up........i even went through the previous chapters looking for her traces...but only found her name mentioned once........i dint like it at all.........Spoilers END************************all in all a OK book with not so great story............
4,"Not bad, but no masterpiece","I am bemused, and slightly amazed, to read some of the exultant reviews of this book. I've been reading Stephen King for 20 years (and I am only 31!) and Bag of Bones isn't bad, but it is nowhere near Mr. King's best work (The Stand, Different Seasons, The Dead Zone, The Green Mile). As always, the characters are incredibly well drawn and seamless but the plot is ill-conceived and overall the book isn't very tightly written. Mr. King tackles a very tired genre, the ghost story, and injects more life into it than ever could have been imagined. However, he should have stuck to more of this world (Mr. Noonan and his deceased wife, Mattie Devore, an ugly racial incident) and left the spooks and goblins to children's authors. Like most of Mr. King's ardent fans, I think he is one of the best living American authors, but he does his best work when crafting a story out of real, breathing characters."
3,chaotic,"This book is a definate page turner. I enjoyed the first person narration, as well as the character of Mike Noonan. The story did have me guessing what was going on, but I was in for disappointment. The ending is kind of predictable, and I think he tells us more than we want to know. It is a good read, but I have come to expect more from the King."
5,Bag of Bones,"This is an excellent example of King at his best !! Creepy but oh so good , could not put it down !!"
4,Book v. TV Movie,"I saw the TV movie before I read the book. I think watching the movie helped me visualize the book..if that makes sense. I did the same with The Green Mile and The Shining. There are some slow parts in the book and i think had i not watched the movie i may have lost interest quickly. However, I knew what was in store so i kept going. Overall, it's a great story. Better than the TV Movie and I will someday read it again!"
2,Not typical King.,"I am a huge Stephen King fan, so naturally I was excited to read his then latest release, Bag of Bones. I was a little disappointed. It can not be classified as horror, which he is best known for. The book focuses on the loss of his wife and his inability to continue writing, with a few ghosts thrown into the mix. If a reader does not read King regularly and is not accustomed to his style of writing, they might enjoy it."
3,A classical Stephen King's style,"I found nothing different than King's style in this book. Everything is similar to his other book scene, characters, story nothing change even a bit. Sometimes I feel like I am reading The Shining again. there is really great similarity between shining and this book but of course shining is much more better than this book. May be the most suitable sentence for this book is It isn't the best but it isn't the worst either"
1,BORING- DONT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY,"The thing that I like about most of King's books is that they are page turners. You get so involved with the books that you absolutely have to know what is going to happen in the next chapter. Is my favorite character going to die? Will they ever make it out alive? This is displayed in such masterpieces such as The Stand and Desperation. But Bag of Bones was the complete opposite. The only thing I found interesting about this book is the relationship between Mike, Mattie, and Kyra. But King then had to go and take away the best part of the book (Mike and Mattie's relationship). After Mattie got killed, I was mad. Their relationship was the only thing that kept me turning the pages. Everything else was crap and Im sorry I wasted my time reading the first 260 pages. If you want to read a REAL King book, try The Green Mile, The Stand, the short story ""The Mist"", and Desperation. Stay away from Bag of Bones and The Tommyknockers at all costs."
4,King's move into Gothic horror,"I have been a King fan for years, although recenlty I departed from his genre to pursue more fulfilling writing. However, I think in Bag of Bones, King has shucked that ""Big Mac and fries"" style of writing for a more formal approach.The book reads like a classic horror novel in places. Granted, he throws in the pop culture that we come to expect from him in places, but I bet in 100 years, this book will be listed as a great American classic novel. Some of the action in the end is pretty predictible, but it has to be. That is what makes the genre, and King does it better than anyone else.King is an excellent writer. I've taught English in universities and professors have scoffed at him, calling him a barbarian with words. But, after reading Bag of Bones, I know King has full command of his writing skills. I think he put the peddle down on this book and crafted an excellent read."
3,A different King,A lot more heart and emotion than what he usually has in his books. A bit long and tedious and confusing until you get to the last 50 pages. The first King book I've read that I had absolutely no idea as to where he's taking me. The concept of small towns with big secrets sort of placed the whole story to a credible level.Not a bad book but I would recommend his other books first especially to first time King readers (the Dark Half was very entertaining).
2,BORING SO FAR,Sometimes I feel that King gets too wordy and goes on and on! And I'm getting the characters confused. The beginning caught me right away but then the chapters slowed down. I feel like skipping chapters but I'm afraid that I might miss something REAL important that might tie everything together. Does this get any better?
2,"My First Stephen King Book, Not a Good Start","This book was a ""non-scary,"" slow read, that lacked pizzazz - basically it was a snore.It appeared that Stephen King just sat down and started writing without a story in mind. About half way through the book, he developed a lackluster plot. Towards the end he wrapped things up in such a jumbled, unthoughtful manner that he required a 5 page summary to explain. Ack.If you want to read this book, do yourself a favor. Read the first 25 pages and then skip to the 5 page summary. Then, go out and buy one of his more popular books instead. ;-)"
5,COMPELLING; SUSPENSEFUL,"I think that this is most definitely one of King's best work. It is a mix of his best horror and psychological thriller styles. There is just enough of each so that you aren't grossed out or confused by twists and turns in the plot. The characters are well developed and the plot will keep you turning pages until well past midnight. The characters are so well written that you will either completely love them or hate them, with no middle ground. ""Bag of Bones"" is one of King's greatest novels, and positively one of my all-time favorites."
4,"Still reading, but it has grabbed hold of me!","Although I am somewhat of a ""novice"" Stephen King fan, this is still a great book. Having read ""The Stand"" and ""The Shining"" in the past three months, this one is nowhere near the quality of those two, but it is still a great book. If I'm not up reading in the early hours of the morning, I am jumping at every litte creak in my apartment. It is a wonderful book to just curl up with and get lost. I'm not going to write a essay on criticism (that's what college is for!) but it a fun, creepy novel. Just don't put any of those magnetic alphabet letters on your fridge!!"
2,Not his Best,"I own and have read every Stephen King book there is (Except one) and I have to say this is not one of his best. I feel that this time he went more on the side of predictable then he ever has. The opening chapter was a page turner and kept me going but somewhere along the way it lost me. I had the feeling that I had read the story before many times with just a different twist. Usually reading a SK book is a sit down all day and never put it down, this one took a week."
2,Boring as a bag of bones,I was very disappointed in this book. It is by far the most boring book I have ever read. Sorry to say!
1,This book is trash.,"I wonder if Stephen King even wrote this book. It lacked all of the character development and realistic dialogue that he has made his trade mark. In terms of likeable characters, I could have lined all of them up by mid-book and shot them. There's not a likeable character in the book. In addition, this book was a complete cliche. Boo! Hiss!"
4,captivating,i loved it. i wasn't a king fan anymore but this book took me away. i couldn't help but to read on and on. i can't wait to read the next book.
5,King proves his royalty,"Stephen King has always ben a best seller, but could he always write? This question does not need to be asked with Bag of Bones. The book does have many twists, turns, sideplots, and seemingly endless turns down tangent lane, but they all meet down the line, every turn leading to one of his best stories to date."
5,Terrific entertainment by a great storyteller!,What starts with a deliberate pace explodes into a neck-throttling thriller. King is so good in this one! If you've ever wondered why he's such a successful writer...the last 300 pages of this story should incapacitate you from anything functional but finishing it. Bravo to a grand stroryteller!!!
3,Interesting story but pacing needs tightening up,Stephen King's 'Bag of Bones' is a vengeful ghost story that takes a good while to build up and pick up steam. King takes a meandering pace with this story following one of his preferred character archetypes - the tortured writer trying to slog through a massive bout of writer's block. Compounding the issue are tortured memories of his recently deceased wife and an angry ghost out to wreck havoc on anything crossing its path. While these components sound like vintage King - the initially agonizing pacing makes this book a series of highs and lows in terms of sustaining my interest. Ultimately I did manage to finish it in its entirety and while I felt the time invested was sorta worth it - I've certainly read better from King.
3,"Not bad,but ok","This books oscillates from bad to ok to good and then again bad.Overall the book could have been trimmed to 500 pages instead of the 700 odd pages to read.Stephen king takes great pain to establish the credibility of each character and therin lies the plus point of the story,though not so scary when compared to his other works this book certainly deserves one reading,overall this book would have been much interesting with all the trimming."
2,Good...until 3/4 the way through,"I really liked 'Bag of Bones' until King killed off Maddie, followed by a side of typical Politically Correct heinous white on black rape/murder/racism.The ""evil racist white guy"" theme is just so saturated in today's media. And something predictable, there's going to be a movie!It's a shame King's on board the social order's anti-white propaganda wagon.-JS"
2,i don't understand how this book got five stars..,"This book is not a novel. It's a lie, a lie that the author also don't believe. Needless, long and boring depictions, confusing and crude accidents, no tension, exaggerations, non-interesting fabrications here and there.. I was so appointed. As for this book in the least, the author pursued nothing, .. But I'm going to read his another book, The shining. Only for his fame. There, I hope to find a novelist.."
3,King's Novels Featuring Writers,"Have been a dedicated Stephen King reader since - forever. Love his latest, Under the Dome. It's almost Dickensian in its breadth and wealth of characters, a satire of our times - and a darn good read. One can't help loving his heroes and hating his villains.Having said that, for some reason, I have never enjoyed King's books featuring writers as main characters - be it Misery, the one with the character who claims that the main hero stole his manuscript - and this one. (I enjoyed On Writing, by the way.) They are somehow smug, ""take it from an insider"", including the shtick about the writer being no literary giant. I'm listening to the Bag of.. audio and like King as a narrator, but this somehow adds to my opinion on the book. Does anybody have an opinion?"
3,Not up to par !,As a Stephen King addict I have to say I did not get my fix from this too long novel. Of course no one hits a home run every at-bat but this was less than a pop-fly. None-the-less I'll no doubt purchase every book he writes because when he gets it right there's no one better.
3,700+ Page Rationalization,"Bag of Bones breathes life until the fated storm, some two hundred pages before the end of the novel. The culminating pages of the book appear to be King's rationalization for the standard plot twist that leads to the books final events. While the beginning of the novel offers interesting insight on pulp fiction writers and plugging out thick books annually, the ending doesn't cut it. Should have stuck more to Bartleby, and less to the ghosts... try Beloved instead."
2,Leave 200 pages out,Would've been a much better story if he left about 200 pages out. It was to drawn out - the story lost it's momentum and failed to evoke any real horror.
4,King does it again,"This is a very good book. For years now, King has been trying to transcend the horror-genre corner he long ago painted himself into, often producing mixed results. While this probably won't be many people's all-time favorite King novel ever, it probably will keep you up a few nights. This is a fresh and lively ghost story that manages to hold you in it's clutches for darn near 800 pages."
5,Simply Great!,"This book captures a bit of everything...humor, horror, love. Once inside this novel, i couldn't get out."
4,A Quick Entertaining Read,"I was suprised to see a reference to ""Get Shorty"" in another review, because that was the comparison that kept occurring to me as I read this book. The humor, writing style, and references to movies were very similar, in a positive way. The plot twists were engaging, and while the actual caper strained credibility, it was entertaining and original."
3,Hit&Miss Book,"there are things that I enjoyed about the Book such as the Spritual Journey reached,but the title&the way certain thing didn't flow as I'd hope they would throughout the book left me lost in spots.still it's a Interesting Book that makes you think&go over details.I guess you end up making up your own mind where you stand on it in the end."
4,great coffee,"This machine makes the best espresso. My only complaint is that it doesn't make it quite hot enough for me. I use cream in mine, so I microwave it first and that takes care of the temperature problem."
3,not exactly what I ordered but they are still ok,usually saladitos are salted prunes apricots have a little different flavor but they are still good recieved them very quick good supplier
5,One Good Book,"I really liked this book on D-Day. I have read several books about the subject. This one compares favorably with The Longest Day, which I really enjoyed as history of the actual event."
4,D-Day June 6 1944,"The book arrived within 6 days. The condition of the book was good ,no marks or stains, torn or damaged pages , The book is good reading and hard to put down, a great buy."
3,Wealth of information presented in a confusing way.,I did like the book. The stories and the personal observations made by men who were there is fascinating and enjoyable. The detail is significant. I felt the writing could have been smoother and tighter with linking themes and content. Too many themes pulled together in one paragraph for example...
5,great condition,It took a long time to receive the merchandise. I just received the book yesterday and I ordered it 6 weeks ago.
3,SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO READ,"Mr. Ambrose did an excellent job interviewing veterans and including their harrowing stories, many of which were very touching and amazing. However, I had a hard time following the chronology and placing the battle geography. I understand that maps and photos increase the cost of a book, but there were too many references to towns and roads that I couldn't place, and it soon all became meaningless. The landing was detailed just as the movie ""In Search of Private Ryan"" depicted."
4,"astonishing account of courage, bravery, horror under fire","This book is an awe inspiring account of the Normandy invasion of June 6th, 1944 and the men from the United States, England, Canada, France and other countries composing the Allied forces. The book of 580 pages gives an account of events leading to the D-Day invasion and varying accounts of the invasion with personal perspectives of many of the Allied and German soldiers involved in the action. The book contains two sections of black and white photos of the invasion troops, the beaches, ships and equipment. Recounted incidents of hundreds to thousands of men killed directly on the beach, others wounded and the heroics, panic, and horror of that day are mind-boggling. I have a much greater sense of respect for the men of that invasion after reading of what they went thru to stop Hitler and the Nazi forces. Highly recommended reading for anyone interested in WWII history."
1,"Ugly American Read, Where is Canada and Britain?","If you want a book with a major case of John Wayne syndrome. ,his is the book for you. The mission Involved the US taking utah and omaha beach, Brits taking Gold and Sword and Canada taking Juno. The Canucks shattered the german defences at Juno within 2 hours. Americans spearheaded attacks on only 2 of the 5 beaches at Normandy. you read this book and you'll think Amricans were the only ones that showed up ."
1,Junk History,"This book is junk history of the worst order. Hopefully Stephen E. Ambrose has kept the tapes and letters from the many interviews he obviously conducted to research this book so that they might be used by better historians to write a accruate, non-biased account of D-Day."
3,"Informative, To Informative","I think that the title of this review says it all, it is informative. I have read other books by Stephen Ambrose like Band of Brothers, and The Wild Blue, and i must say that both of these while shorter, and focus on a smaller group, are overall a better book. Dont get me wrong, I would suggest this to anyone intrested in World War Two, But to the average reader, you may want to read some of his other books first.The first thing that Ambrose did was to add too many trivial things. I understand that small things make the big picture, but I dont need to know how many packs Eisenhower smoked a day. I think that he should get more in depth on the stories, whitch he dose, but later in the book. So in conclusion, if your a beginner of Ambrose books, looking for an intresting read on World War Two, I highly suggest Band of Brothers. But if your looking for an in depth view on the planning, of d-day then this book might be for you."
5,"D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II",This great book is one of the most informative books on the Normandy invasion and World War II in general. The info in here has enlightened me a great deal and has helped me with insites I needed to complete the book I'm currently write on World War II. I would recomend this book to any history buff or anyone wishing to learn more about the bravery of our fathers and grandfathers fighting for our freedom
4,Intense and powerful,"While Ambrose tends to get wordy and verbose in his descriptions, his attention to detail can not be denied. While other reviewers have shown anger at Ambrose's focus on the American troops there is a reason - the British and the Canadians could NEVER have defeated the Nazi's without the American strength (in part supported by such powerful generals such as Eisenhower and Marshall) Also, Omaha beach where the American's landed was by far the most devestating battle - Juno, Gold and Sword in comparison were a walk in the park. Where Churchill cowered - Eisenhower ruled. These facts can not be denied. Terrific book but if you want more of the Canadian and British contributions read a book by a foreign author - I am sure that they focus on their patriots and leave the Americans out as well."
2,Good Booch,I have this book read and it is good for information I did find. The scriber is good and information is accurrate. Germany should have one the battel but to much advantages wasted by us. Thanks you.
3,"Softer, but acceptable.","It's not the same Drowning Pool that made Sinner, but it still has some good songs. Unfortunately, Drowning Pool continued on their downward trend and I no longer buy any of their new albums."
3,"Next time, fail better","Regarding the alleged ""Library Journal Review"", I recommend reading the name of the reviewer backwards. A most interesting coincidence ... or is it?"
4,Totally refreshing,"This is a really refreshing book about tarot. The way Mangiapane writes is not academic and it doesn't have the typical tarot book wording or tone, which I for one, am thankful for.Although I don't agree with a couple of things in this book, especially when he refers to the tarot of Marseille, this book is great for studiying the RWS, as I really don't think tou can use it with any Marseille Tradition deck or any Toth tradition deck.All in all, a very refreshing book, great contents, a little annoying on the ""you're not a doctor"" thing (one time is enough I think). A book in tarot much needed and very welcomed."
5,imation works great,"I've used two 100-packs of imation CD-Rs over the last couple of years and have had no problems. The burned CDs have played fine in my Car CD player as well as my home CD-changer and DVD player. I've burned data CDs, audio CDs and Video CDs with no difficulties at all. For those interested, I have a Sony CD burner and use NERO to burn all of my CDs."
2,Tibetan Chants,"Wanted this for meditation, didn't know you could listen to it before you bought it. I learned. It's ok to listen to but a little rough for meditation for me."
5,Listen to this every morning and love it.,"I have listened to these chants every morning before I start my day since I have recieved this item, with the exception of one day and that day seemed to get a little unbalanced for me. I wont start my day without it. Intense and deeply inspiritional. We all need to start our day in balance and harmony with ourselves and with everything around us. Thank you and Namaste!"
4,MC5 Hits Stoner Avenue.,"The energy level of this album is close to the MC5 classic ""Kick Out The Jams"" with a very slight tinge of stoner rock thrown in for good measure.If you're a fan of late 60's and early 70's Detroit Rock you will not be disppointed by this album. Killer drums and Orange Amp driven guitar throughout. The fact that it clocks in at only a little over 26 minutes is a disappointment(..). Otherwise it would be a 5 star album."
1,Sizzle over substance -,"I feel cheated - 50 pages????. And the author apologizes for letting you down in the first few!! Even at its low price this book is a rip-off. There are so many other hardcover non-fiction books that truly give guidance and satisfaction. ""Winning at Mergers & Acquisitions"" is a much better investment, a great summer book, and will actually help you keep your job when your company gets bought. But it wasn't written by a novelist with a friend on TV."
1,Disappointing,"I like Anna Quindlen, but this book was a dissapointment. I can't imagine why it sells so well other than brilliant marketing and the author's good name. Perhaps I simply expected too much, but there is not much more to this booklet than ""you should get a life, and appreciate it."" Over half the pages (literally) have no text but are filled with unoriginal b/w stock photos. You will finish what little there is to read in this book in a matter of minutes, and be left with little more to think about other than ""I wish I hadn't spent ten bucks on that."" Those who seek truly thought-provoking advice on living a happy life would do well to read the writings of Gary Zukav, the Dalai Lama, or newcomer Taro Gold."
5,The title says it ALL!,"What an absolute gem!If you're looking for the usual self-help, get in touch with your inner child, how-to, been there-know how you feel, flowery books leave this one on the shelf. If you're looking for a real down to earth person with a prescription for developing a no nonsense passion for living, Anna's your girl.Her book is written with style, humor, and grace. No doubt, this is the shortest book I have ever read but one that will certainly leave a lasting impact."
1,A Short Guide to Getting Shortchanged,"If you've read Ms. Quindlen's columns, heard her speak, or know of her boilerplate commencement address, this booklet is not worth the money. While I've often enjoyed and admired her writing, and did hear her speak in college, this item is a real disappointment. I made the mistake of buying it impulsively at the checkout counter, and feel foolish for having done so. She's attained a status as someone who is trustworthy, and wouldn't necessarily stoop to a cheap marketing ploy to cash in on something like this ""guide."" It's a two minute read, spread out over a deceptively thicker booklet, with a lot of silly b/w photos unrelated to the work. Mea culpa for succumbing to the counter display, and I can't blame anyone for making a buck, but it won't happen again."
3,"Nice message, but don't pay for it","I read this book in about 5 minutes at the library. It's a nice and important message - value yourself and the people in your life more than material goods/earning a living. I suspect that the proceeds from this book (which must have taken Ms Quindlen, who I normally think is an incredible writer, a half hour to write) will allow Ms. Quindlen to practice what she preaches."
2,Condition Description,"I can't remember if this used book seller described this book as ""Good,"" ""Very Good,"" or ""Like New,"" but it's dirty around the edges and looks like it got wet and then dried. Very disappointed and might not buy any more used books."
1,I agree with the other negative reviews.,"This was a huge disappointment. Frankly, I wondered how the author allowed it to be published. It's nothing more than a longish greeting card with, as another reviewer here wrote, bad stock photos.I'm returning mine."
5,Perfect for the N95,"This case is perfect for the N95, this is the new version. Some of the bad reviews refer to the old version. This one is great, very functional, and allows you to access every function (including camera) with great ease. By far the best case for the N95 I've seen..."
5,Great gift.,This was the perfect gift for my best friend's husband. He is so very hard to buy for. But he loves the Opera. He couldn't put it down.
4,Good book but.....,"While I enjoyed the greater part of Edward Hume's book, I took exception to his description of Trisomy 13. His description shows the child as having absolutely no chance of knowing his parents, as only having vegetable status as a future if they live at all. Having had a child with Trisomy 18 and being on a listserve with parents of Trisomy 13 children, I take exception. Although most Trisomy 13 children do not survive, some do. Just as Humes writes later in his book..""Some children just decide to live, even if they're not supposed to."" My child also spent time in the NICU, and much of what he wrote brought me back, but his absolute position on Trisomy 13 makes me wonder what other information he has done the same with."
5,Sick Guitar,Couldn't be happier with this guitar. Killer tone and the intonation is spot on. Always been impressed with Dean. They are my guitars of choice whether I'm playing live or in the studio. Not easy finding a good left-handed guitar these days but Dean gets it done!!!
1,Not a story,"I did not like this book. I did not like it because it is very boring.This book is about the soviet spyagency and its history, all the way back to Napolean.You would like this book if you want to get information, not if you want a story. Do not read this thinking it is a story. You will get very bored with it."
4,It Really Is So Good,"Amazon has really confused me they've mixed up the CD tracklisting for the Both So Good CDs anyway So Good is the second single for rachel's forthcoming 2nd album which is to be released in October like her previous single negotiate with love So Good has an 80's electro theme but is a bit more dancier this single really shows off rachel's vocals with powerful lyrics such as (i'm gonna stand the test of time/ i'm gona take back what is mine) and (i'd like to watch you suffer ever so slightly/ you better watch your back you better beware) just like Sweet Dreams My L.A Ex and Negotiate With love, So Good is about getting over an ex boyfriend.So Good is a real slice of pop prefection and if you agree with me then buy it."
4,i got it on time and it works,great for the money but i would recommend a side feed hopper it works for all the guns i put it on and is so far quite durable
2,if u got an e-trigger dont buy,"this loader is useless if u got an e-trigger, it dont feed fast enough ur gonna keap breaking ball, shooting blanks, and ur gun is just goin to jam up."
3,Didn't quite spin as a Musical,"OK are we making a musical here??? Let's have some music numbers!!! I liked the musical idea and feel of the movie; however I really thought there were not enough musical moments and the moments there were, were obviously dubbed. I felt there was too much dialogue to spin as a musical and I found the superfluous background music more of an annoyance then anything. I would have liked to have seen character development through song instead of bland dialogue and I would have appreciated a more dramatic feel to the story instead of ridiculous antics of a bunch of newbie queers chasing each other. I loved the look of the movie (semi fantasy), I liked the teenage love story, I thought the tryout duet and some of the more dramatic musical numbers were beautiful and there was plenty of Eye Candy, I just felt the movie came up a bit short to spin as a musical or a serious work."
5,Fun Movie,"I thought that ""Were the World Mine"" was a fun movie definitely aimed at a community which has always provided most of the world's creativity , yet still remains vilified and all but invisible. The plot of this movie is: ""What if prejudice against sexual minorities was replaced with tolerance and fearless self expression""? Obviously this couldn't be a mainstream movie, yet the message is relevant and pretty well acted by most involved. As an amusing and light flick, this movie delivers .. certainly if one is unfamiliar ""GLBT themed"" cinema, this would be an excellent first experience.Academy Award winner? ..... Definitely not, but I don't regret purchasing it and shall watch it again with friends!"
2,bad enough to stop halfway through,"I'm a voracious reader, and that equates to about a book a week for me. I am a lover of all sci fi, and plenty of other fiction, too.This book was as fingernails on slate by the time I was half through so I stopped. It is self-consciously clever- so much so I blushed with embarassment for the author. A 10 year old girl demonstrated a working familiarity with scholarly writings on existentialism and feminist politics to her estranged-but-loveable dad. He didn't comment on this absurd precosity. That's when I gave up.As much as I read books and these reviews which often guide my purchases, I rarely post anything, myself. Here I make the effort to save you -stranger- from a distinctly unpleasant dose of forcedand insincere mirth."
3,humorous sci fi...,It has this crazy half-superman anti-hero.Sterling is good at throwing out literary names and factsI've never heard of.Examples:1) Pelevin ( Russian author) wrote Omon Ra and The Yellow Arrow2) Turkish cabaret music3) America is basically nine different cultural regionsThe book is humorous but somehow too negative.It is basically a satire on made for pop groups.Bruce Sterling is sort of a cyberpunk James Barrie.I think it it is his lack of integrity that bothers me most?
1,not much life time in battery,"I am very disappointed in this battery. The life time of the battery is very low...maybe 60 minutes. When snorkeling in Hawaii, the battery life was shorter than my duration in the water which was less than an hour. I did take a few pics on the beach as well, but I ran out of battery juice in about an hour. I am looking for a battery for my W30 that will give me more life time on the battery. You don't get many pics on the life of one fully charged battery."
1,Couldn't Deliver,I ordered from Beach Camera. Three weeks later the battery still hadn't shown up. I e-mailed Beach Camera and said where is my stuff. They replied that they couldn't deliver it. I inquired again. They said they didn't know what happened. After another week I demanded a refund. At least they got that done.
2,"Too much philosophy, not enough content","The authors are clearly qualified and knowledgeable, but the book suffers from being a dry and largely superficial overview of almost every concept related to computers, IP networking, telecommunication and e-commerce. Little space is devoted to real-world examples, illustrations of products and promise of specific technologies in e-commerce.The book is probably written to those who need a some ""corridor competence"" to talk about these matters, but there's little technical ""meat"" to be found here."
1,No good.,"This movie was quite disappointing. AFter having seen two outstanding movies (Old Boy & Mr. Vengeance), I expected something much better."
1,only good on TV,"I bought this from Target last week on sale for 9.99. I figured for 2 in a pack I couldnt go wrong and I like the idea of having just one tool for several things.I'm generally pretty good about staying away from ""As seen on TV"" products becuase my past experiences have always been very bad. And this one proved me right yet again!When I came home to try it out as a whisk I was disappointed. It was difficult to handle, the grip wasnt so good and the flat whisking splattered the liquid here and there. So as a whisk its really no good. I'll have to try out the other uses but given the choice I wouldn't buy it again."
4,"Wonder Mixer, Chef Genuis etc.....","I like them all, the chef genius and wonder mixer are basically the same product as the chef genius and they are about the same price. They work great for alot of things. Easy cooking tool, I use it alot."
5,Five Stars is Not Enough...,"This is such a wonderful album..I fell into it 'accidentally', and have been moved by every song. I have never heard this kind of music before, and although I don't know a word of Hawaiian (Ok, maybe ONE..'aloha'), the songs are so beautifully sung by Keali'i that you just seem to understand what they are saying.""I've Been Wanting Memories"" is an incredible track that is on par with some of Bobby McFerrin's best work, and Keali'i's rendition of ""In My Life"" (with spine tingling hawaiian Chant) is alone worth the price of the album.Buy this one...you won't be sorry."
3,Kawaipunahele,Words can't describe the beauty found in the music which lies inside the CD cover. The music speaks so beautifully about the love of the people within the island population. What a true historian of Hawaiian culture.
5,Awesome for KIDS! Puts them to sleep!,"I listened to this music (my daughter is half Hawaiian) when my daughter was a baby ten years ago and it would always soothe her and put her to sleep because it's so soothing and beautiful. Now, my son, when he teeths he is inconsolible! He will not stop for a bottle, to be rocked, sang to, put down in his bed, etc. But I play this, and not even 3 seconds later, he is on his way to la la land. It is wonderful. I recommend it to any parent! Or anyone who wants to de-stress."
5,The Best Love Songs Ever,"I took Kawaipunahele with me on vacation to the mountains and it became the theme song for our trip, which was so peaceful and tranquil... just like the entire CD. I ordered his other 2 recordings today and can't wait to get them. Whether you like Hawaiian music or not, you will love this artist! He appeals to everyone."
5,fantasy,"I'm getting into the story... it's good escape fiction, well plotted with characters one can identify with. I'll read more by Ms Flewelling."
2,"Noble effort, but really nothing new in the genre","I was drawn to this work from a recomendation from George RR Martin, who is my favorite fantasy writer. But, I was bitterly disappointed in this book. The writing is competent, the atmosphere chilly and she tries to build up momentum for the main story, a few subplots, and fills in a backstory. But, very little seems to get accomplished in the first 250 pages. There were no characters that I actually cared about and no sense of wonder at any mystery that made me want to turn the page. By way of contrast, GRRM's works by that point had at least 5 characters that I wanted to learn much more about and had started half a dozen story lines that captured my interest. Bone Doll seems to put almost all its eggs in one basket with its main story, and it's not as interesting as one of the top 3 of GRRM's subplots. A very competent writer, but there are better books."
2,Disappointed,"I guess the novel was well written but I can't help feeling somewhat disappointed. I loved Lynn's three previous novels and have read them so many times I could quote chapter and verse. What I loved about those stories was the beautiful relationship between Seregil and Alec, their comraderie and wit, the dangers and trials and triumphs and eventual love. I've searched for years for novels featuring a male friendship and I miss that dynamic in this latest story by Lynn. Stories of truly wonderful male friendships are difficult to find in any genre but I hit the mother lode with ""Luck in the Shadows"", ""Stalking Darkness"" and ""Traitor's Moon."" As I said, the book was well written for what it was, but I couldn't empathize with the characters.I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the further adventures of Seregil and Alec. Please Lynn!!"
1,Kidding me? the most absurd names book ever!,"if you are looking to name your new born (or for that matter know anyone with the names of) bhuta, bhutabhavana, bhutadamani, bhutadhamani, bhutadi or bhutajyoti or similar; congrats this book maybe for you.For everybody else in the real world, I wouldn't recommend wasting 22 odd bucks on a book of names by a person who misspells (or mispronounces) her own name."
1,Hindi Book of Names - Not useful,"Although this book is PACKED with names, it consists of mostly historical or older names. The most common and modern names were not part of this book. I went through each name till the letter ""M"" before I had to just put the book aside. I didn't find 1 potential name in the entire book. What is this book excellent for? It is great for understanding historical names. There is no doubt a lot of work and research went into this book- its just the intention is educational- not for practical use in naming your child."
2,too many ads,"I really like this magazine, but there are ads on every other page.....should print more stories and recipes, and cut back on the ads"
5,Very Good Magazine,"Woman's Day is a great magazine for everyday living. I'm very crafty and it has ideas for making things that can ""spruce up"" our home or just make us smile."
2,Woman's Day magazine,I have not received any issues of this magazine yet. I really like this magazine and buy it at the groc store so thought this would be an excellent one to get thru subscription. I have not received one issue yet!
4,Good Quality for the Price,"I have received Woman's Day for many years. It is a great quality magazine for the price. It always has lots of wonderful recipes, useful tips, and interesting articles about everyday women. I especially enjoy the holiday issues...the colorful covers look festive on the coffee table. I would highly recommend Woman's Day to women everywhere."
3,"Functional, but not a high performance part","Bare bones cable. The finish on this cable is rougher than more expensive cables, leading to higher friction in the system. If this is OK, and it's KO with me, the price is right."
2,Doesn't Anyone Read Agatha Christie Anymore?,"I read this book because so many people said what a great surprise ending it had. Are they kidding? I guessed the murderer about halfway through the book, and was disappointed when I was right. Not much of a challenge. If the incomparable Ms Christie had written this book, somebody REALLY surprising - but with fair clues - like the panhandler, would have turned out to be the murderer. Believe me, I'm not giving anything away when I say this. Subtlety isn't this author's strong point. I expect his avid fans to put a ton of ""Not Useful"" marks by this review, but the review isn't for them. It's for the reader who's looking for a good mystery: don't be snowed by all the gushing. An unsuspenseful story, predictable culprit, and undistinguished style - don't bother."
1,"If this is his best, I don't want to read his worst","I'm sorry to go against the average opinion on this book but I found it extremely boring, at least till page 200 or so! Everytime I'd open it and try to read it I got sleepy eyes.What's up with all the street names of LA?? Who cares about every single street every single carachter takes on his way to anywhere??Unless you're from LA this becomes utterly boring! Delete all the references to streets, avenues, boulevards and whathaveyou and you will end up with a 20 pages book even a child could write.Very repetitive (too much so) descriptions and thoughts and quite predictable.Again, if so many people consider this book to be the best among those Connelly has written thus far I can say this is my first and LAST."
5,Outstanding.,"What a piece of work! Mr Connelly did it again brilliantly. One of the best works on the Harry Bosch's series (probably the best). If you're looking for a book that keeps you reading by the hours, this is your best choice. And let Harry Bosch, Sylvia, Edgar, the Dollmaker and the Follower do the service for your entertainment. You just have to sit and enjoy the reading."
3,Pretty hum-drum,"Spoiler alert: This is a workaday mystery in the Harry Bosch detective series. It lacks much suspense, and the characters are a bit hollow. The author, an ex-LA Times newsman, makes the culprit out to be an LA Times reporter. He must have enjoyed himself writing that. Otherwise, you won't be kept up too late on this one. It's medicore, at best."
4,Connelly's Best (so far),"After reading a few of Connelly's more recent novels, I decided to go back and read the Harry Bosch books in order. The Concrete Blonde is the third installment, and in my opinion, it is the best one so far. While Bosch is on trial for shooting a man suspected of being a serial killer called the Dollmaker, another victim is discovered who appears to have been killed after the shooting. Bosch must investigate the crime and determine if he shot an innocent man."
2,Watch out,"I bought this book a couple months ago and I'm really disappointed because I found several wrong answers on it, not forgetting to mention the fact that several parts of this book are made from ""topics"". That's it. But... if I need to study by topics I'll go straight to Books Online, and not for this certification book, right?My opinion: Look for another book. There must be other better than this."
2,Not as hot as I remember,"I'm very dissapointed with this sauce, I remember it as very hot, however after openning it, it wasn't at all. Will not buy it again, it was a waste of time and money."
4,the right formula,"KR consistently has the right combination of songs and arrangements, instruments and harmonies. His work is relaxing and his soothing harmonies are a blessing in my not-so-soothing life."
2,Felt Like Puppy Love,I'm so sorry to say but I really did NOT like this CD. The tunes were pretty similar and felt like puppy love songs. There were very few of the Hawaiian style songs that I like and look forward to from Keali'i Reichel but not enough to make me like the whole CD. I am donating mine to the library...
4,Nice Pics,"I enjoyed the book - well worth reading for this newbie to routing. It has helped me in planning for a raised panel door that I'm working on. The best feature is the very clear picture illustrations. Wishes: 1) more information on various hinge systems, 2) more detailed treatment of drawers and their installation."
4,Northern Exposures,Interesting to see the behind the scenes aspect of the show. A good book for serious fans.
2,Bad....could have been good.,"The book started out good and then fell apart. There were far to may holes in this book, and the ending seemd rushed and not thought out at all.Although when first reading the plot seemed very interesting, but after reading.....and reading.....and reading you realized that it was a bit to much.The development of the characters were great as usual with Deaver's, but to actually think that the FBI could be so careless is crazy.Hoping that The Empty Chair is better, because that read was STRIKE ONE."
4,Great Read but not as great as Bone Collector,"I loved this book in it's detail about forensics when it came to documents. Mr. Deaver has a talent at fooling the reader to provide a good twist! Looking forward to the ""Empty Chair""!"
5,Best action/adventure book of the year!,"I think reviewing a novel is best achieved by comparing it to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. So I would say that The Devil's Teardrop could be best described as a spellbinding novel of intrigue, it has the relentless pace and stunning power of The Triumph and the Glory, the plot twists of Grisham at his best, the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain, and the style and flavor of Tom Clancy's Executive Orders."
4,Lucky find on the airlines...,"If I hadn't found this novel by accident in the front storagepocket on the airline, I would never have read itDespite not being a murder mystery reader, I was truly captivated by the well developed characters and twisting plot. Who knew so much could be deduced from a single handwritten note? It made a boring flight pass so quickly that I've order two additional Deaver novels for upcoming trips. END"
3,Not for first time Deaver readers,"I am a total fan of J Deaver, however, I would not recommend this book to first time readers as unfortunately it has not lived up to his previous novels. Not a bad read, however"
2,Well... I've read better.,"This is the first book I picked up by Mr. Deaver and as soon as I got to the checkout line, people who saw the book said ""he's really good!"" Then another person tells me that he's the guy who wrote the book that became the movie, The Bone Collecter. Now that impressed me as the movie was definitely well made.With high expectations I delved into it, only to be sadly disappointed. While the premise is exciting and there are twists in the tale, the characters are cliches and the story rambles at every opportunity it gets.No doubt the author is a good writer as it shows on occasion, but this book was a major disappointment. While I was reading it people asked me if this book was any good and when I said ""not really"" I was informed that I should read his earlier works which are supposed to be ""very good."" Uh... no thanks, I'll skip."
4,A great read,"Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed this book and thought the content was riveting, it is not the book that Coffin Dancer was."
5,minute-to-minute fright,"I picked up this book and could not put it down. As alwayshappens with Deaver's books, I thought I had the ending figured out,then wham--twist after twist after twist! I highly recommend this book!"
5,My favorite Deaver stand alone book so far!,"Jeffery Deaver is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE AUTHORS & this book is probably my favorite Deaver stand alone book. I wish he'd do a series with the characters from this book...I thought they made a great combo in solving crimes & hated to have to say goodbye! His books have many twists & turns, and you never know what to expect next! If you've read some of Deaver's earlier books/series, namely, the ""The Rune Series"" or the ""The John Pellam Series"", and did not enjoy them, please do not judge him by those books... his writing style changes completely with the ""Lincoln Rhyme"" books. I recommend that you start at the beginning of the series though because it enables you to get to know and appreciate the characters so much more as they grow & develop throughout the books! If you like mystery & suspense, you are going to LOVE Jeffery Deaver & ""The Devil's Teardrop""! What do you say Jeffery Deaver, about making this wonderful combo a series???"
4,A thriller to the very very end,"Excellent book. Not quite as good as ""The Bone Collector"" but a wonderful ""read"" for the summer. The end tells what kind of writer Jeffrey Deaver is. It never quits."
4,"Hey, cool!","I ordered this CD off an [online acution site] and I gotta say, it's really impressive! That guy sure can sing! This CD can't be overlooked by any Air Supply fan. All the songs are very well done. It's not for everyone, though. Some might take his vocals to be a little falsetto at times, but I love his voice. Great solo CD, Russell!"
4,Furi Kuri delivers,"Furi Kuri (not that bogus Fooly Cooly), is quite possibly one of the most brilliant animes made. its got a wonderful intensity that takes a second to get used to but once you do, its all good. the series has wonderful characters that are very much 'real' people. i say, if you're a fan of good stupid anime, buy this series. and if you can't afford it, download it."
5,the COOLEST anime ever,"""Fooly Cooly"" is the best anime ever made. The story behind it is the most creative,yet unique background I have ever seen.Hotako has like the best guitar in the world,which brings me to another point. I also love this amazing anime because I totally love guitars.In conclusion this show is an anime that I could watch again and again.P.S.I think I speak for all the ""Fooly Cooly"" fans in saying PLEASE PLEASE bring this series back to ""Adult Swim""."
1,STINKER ALERT!,"...BR>The story is, well, there really is no coherent story. Trying to believe there is only impaired what little amusement there was to be found. It was about fifteen seconds of watching the little black cat jump around along the shore of a canal during some pointless dialogue. The rest is best described as an ecclectic collection of ""Through the Looking Glass"" style Freudian psycho-sexual imagery that might amuse people who still smoke pot in their parent's basement.Despite the chaotic nature of the series, I found it to be tedious and curiously repetitive after only a few episodes. While being weirded out can be fun, Furi Kuri manages the incredible feat of making it dull.In my opinion, this is a steaming pile to be avoided at all costs, but if you liked ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", you just might disagree."
2,lousy product,"The wireless headphones have really lousy sound. Very bassy - until they quit working altogether after 30 days. Oh well, I bought new headphones.The whole thing quit working after 92 days - 2 days after the warrenty lapsed. How much will they charge to fix it? Who knows. After paying for shipping, it probably isn't worth it. I wouldn't buy a Coby again. I took a shot after having a Coby product before thinking that maybe it was a fluke, but I won't try another one."
5,This is a great guide,"I am planning on backpacking for an extended amount of time in Australia. This guide is invaluable in planning my trip. I love the series - it is perfect for a budget traveller like me. I don't know yet how accurate the info is, as I have yet to go, but the book itself is well written and organized."
1,Awful Product - Do Not Buy!,"Hi,i have never wrote bad review.and this is the first.i bought this Simran unit for 900W product and it just doesn't work.i tested it with multi meter and found that the 1600W optionreturn between 40V-70V instead of 110V-120V.the 50W option works fine.bottom line if you need to use it for product with more than 50Wthis is just doesn't work!save your money."
4,the real thing,"I was looking for original albums of The Fallen Angels, one of my all-time favourite 60s psych rock bands, but until I do this compilation will do. Great songwriting, productions values good for the time, and now so many bands are trying to sound like this, which says a lot."
3,Like concentrated essence of women's magazines,There's a lot of women in this world who never get tired of being told to take a long luxurious bubblebath with scented candles ringing the tub. This book is well-designed to serve them.
2,Magic and Witchcraft are anti-Christian,"Books like this and Harry Potter not only teach anti-Christian lessons on the occult, but also moral relativism, and desensitize children to the black arts!! The anti-Christian message is thinly veiled in these ""childrens stories"" about magic and occultic practices and heavily draws from elements and philosophies behind pagan religions, celtic religions, the religions of the druids, witchcraft, and satanism. What makes this book especially dangerous is that the clever writing and enthralling plot detract from what is otherwise a clearly evil message. My son of 8 was so engrossed in the story that he did not realize the this message about ""witchcraft"" was not fantasy, but rather a sinful reality of our world. God is clear in Scripture that any practice of magic is an ""abomination"" to him. I am truly disturbed that this was on my son's reccommended reading list."
3,"Not ideal for ""year round""","... adding to Jessie's review... Like most plastic, direct sunlight will cause it to deteriorate over time - quickly. We've had ours for about 3 years, putting it up only during winter first 2 years, but left it up all year since previous winter and now many of the seams have torn, particularly around the door and without much egress. For half the price would buy another, but next winter we'll likely build one from PVC pipe and fiberglass panels. Otherwise a great product - for about $200."
2,Expensive Paperwieght,"This Lacrosse Technology WS-096U Wireless Weather Station is poor. The external sensor, placed as per the instructions, says it is 40F and 47Rh. Funny, it is snowing and has been for the last 5 hours - my external thermometer says it is 24F and 96% Rh! I tried getting customer assistance only to be placed on hold and then disconnected - twice. The atomic clock which syncs during the evening was off by one hour even though it was set to the correct region. What a piece of garbage - but makes for a great paperweight or door stop if needed.10/7/2009 Update: External sensor completely failed along with the base station failure. PIECE OF GARBAGE"
5,Makes a great gift,"I gave several of these to friends and family for Christmas, and they all loved it. I got one for myself too. I really like the moon phase feature, and the forecast feature.We have some technically challenged people in our family, and all of us were able to get this set up pretty painlessly. That is saying a lot. It is pretty easy to set this product up, and once it is going it is ""hands-off"", and just works all the time.My only suggestion, would be to add a backlight feature. Like a small button on the top you can push, to light it up, that way you could see it in the dark."
5,great introduction for any age,"This is a wonderful book - geared for children but enjoyable for any age. The book uses straightforward language, so that the reader and listener will not get overwhelmed by complex or archaic terminology. The artwork is just beautiful and will keep the young audience engaged while listening. The book is quite systematic, starting with Gaea and showing the lineages of the Gods, the Titans, etc. By the end of the book, you can look at the last page and identify the 12 Gods who sat on Olympus and a few others to boot. Even adults who have some knowledge of Greek Mythology will appreciate its orderly presentation and the book will help you understand the relationships between the Gods. My only criticism is that pronunciation keys were not provided. This would really help a novice like me (and most children) so as not to butcher their beautiful greek names. Otherwise, I have no criticism at all."
5,Had one as a kid,"When i was a kid this was one of the first books that was ""mine"" and i loved it.It dosn't go itno great detail but i think it has a pretty good overview"
4,The Historical Jesus May Surprise You,"Sometimes when you think you know everything there is to know about the Master Christian, Jesus, a unique, legendary figure, newly presented information can offer further insight and enlightenment. There are new ideas worthy of consideration in this account of the relationship of Jesus to his divine Father."
4,Good reference book,"I found this to be a good reference for areas where I am rusty. It's explanations are too short and based on a users level of expertise that would make it too hard to learn a new area from this book, but its a great single volume reference."
5,No Blues in this Review,"Sikes is a gifted author whose additional skills as a lyricist, poet, short story author, and teacher certainly must have contributed the dimension and texture that helped shape ""Blues for a Dime Store Guitar"" into such a remarkable novel. This is one of those books you are eager to share with a friend, but before you do, you write your name in it because you want to make sure you get it back so you can reread it."
5,hard to believe...,"...how well crafted this story is. I loved it so much for the compassionate eye through which the reader is invited to look at people, even bad people, in the knowledge of all that has shaped their lives up to what they are now. This story reaches such a depth of vision in human soul that one cannot help but feel grateful for having witnessed all of it through the amazing writing of the talented writer that McCrae is, who gifted us with such a peculiar and painful and precious life experience (the character Strekfus being loosely based on the author), which in many ways helps us understand more of our own life.Keeps the mind busy and the heart warm.Great!!!"
1,First book I ever quit reading before the end,"The author must have thought long and hard to come up with the most disgusting abuse imaginable. I was enjoying the book until almost the end. I quit reading when Strekfus discovered the reason for all his idiosyncracies. I not only quit reading, I threw the book in the trash. I enjoy all kinds of fiction, am not prudish or squeamish, but this went too far. I cannot get rid of the image and am furious with the author for creating this horrific visual."
3,"A Barragan ""Teaser"" At Best","This is a short, quirky little book, that reads more like a short book of poetry than a book on architecture or on the great architect luis barragan. It does have a few enticing pictures of his works and a few lines that offer insights into barragan's character. But it's hardly a definitive or essential work. Barragan fanatics probably want it for the collection. Fans but non-fanatics should look elsewhere."
4,Basic teaching book.,"I am in the industry. Had this book from back in grad-school semiconductor class and lab. Good intro book, moderate reference book (good basics, but no latest and greatest and it is missing much process design aspect of things), lacks some details but usually your professor or instructor would have covered it in the labs, homeworks, classnotes, etc. MANY TYPOS in this version. Would honestly rate is as 3 but there isn't much alternative out there anyway."
5,Winter in Wartime (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)...,"I can't add anything to the already positive reviews concerning this movie. The thing that struck me most was the innocence lost - and partially regained by the 13-year old. His family paid a high price indeed during World War II. Powerful, well acted, well made.Recommended viewing.I rate ""Winter in Wartime (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)""...Five stars!"
2,well crafted but very cliched,"setting and acting are fine, but extremely linear and the traitor in the family, the death of his horse are all telegraphed in a very boring manner, in terms of plotting and music, when events happen they are hardly a surprisevery disappointing and not memorablehow can people present a lovable animal early on and then kill it and not expect the audience to expect thisI am sure the Dutch loved this since it is well-produced, nostalgia for their shared heartache under occupation and notions of a valiant resistance,Soldier of Orange a better film for this purpose and even an antique like ""One of Our Planes is missing"" is a far better production"
2,much ado about nothing,"This book is mostly hype and little delivery. The ""inside"" information can largely be found on the net and/or in better-written books by screenwriters of prominence. The agent and producer listings are vague and of little help. The book tells you almost nothing about ""what they want"" and virtually nothing about ""how to win them over."" All in all, it's poorly written and verbose and could have been cut down to a third of its length. Some of it is shockingly inappropriate, such as recommending to African-American writers where they can get good fried chicken in LA. In sum, it's yet another add-water-and-stir screenwriting book by somebody long on self-aggrandizement and short on Hollywood experience. I also find it quite suspicious that twelve five-star reviews here on ... were posted within a three-day period. Yeah, right."
4,The Balsisong Bible!,"Jeff Imada has presented us here with a solid text. Everything you wanted to know and more about the Balisong knife is presented here from knife care, manipulations( to swing blade in and out), self defense and combat tactics just to name a few. Imada really knows how to weild this weapon and a wealth of knowledge and many hours of practise is presented to you. A must for any knife fighter!!!"
5,Case Logic has done it again!,"Compared to what I had been using for my MD player--basically a fanny pack--this case is a HUGE improvement! I was a bit concerned because Amazon.com didn't really go into too much detail, but I will say that it is everything I expected. It has plenty of room for my player and batteries in the main compartment, but if you have one of those small square players you should get something smaller. And there is another zippered compartment with a mesh pocket for my headphones and remote, something I had always been lacking with my portable CD player case. There is also room for 4 discs, but I already have the matching Case Logic 12-MD organizer (yes, it matches perfectly!) so if anything I have extra room.This is something I have been trying to buy ever since I got my MD player, and I was so glad to finally find this great case on Amazon.com. Thanks!"
1,Gospel music,Really bad and not upbeat as I was hoping as I played it near someone who was going onto the next life. If I could have sent it back I would have - now just trying to delete it from the kindle.
4,Very satisfied.,These pants are just what I was looking for and could not find anywhere. They fit perfect. I have not washed them so I can't comment on that.
2,Not Official,"This piece of equipment does work with my Wii, but it is NOT an official Nintendo Wii AC charger. NO WHERE does it say Nintendo on it, and I'm hoping it lasts awhile because it seems lighter than my original Nintendo AC charger. The only reason I had to buy a new one in the first place is because the one that came with my Wii died unexpectantly. So hopefully this unofficial one goes the distance."
1,DON'T BUY THIS POWER SUPPLY,"I bought 2 of these. When I turned one ""ON"" it worked well enough to get the Wii going but when I put in a game disk, the Wii did not recognize it. I tried a lot of other games with the same results.I went as far as calling Nintendo & having them issue a repair slip for a ""defective disk drive"".I later tried an original power supply from another system and all the games loaded & worked just fine. So, I tried the second power supply just to find the SAME PROBLEM PLUS ""SCREEN STATIC"".These units are cheaply made & are very light compared to the originals.I guess you get what you pay for & now I have to call Nintendo & tell them to cancel the repair order.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I threw my money (and both power supplies away)."
1,"NOT ""Official"" Power Supply","First off, let me say I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product. I was led astray (as many others) by the ""Official"" in the title. This does NOT equate to OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), as this device is a cheap overseas knock-off of the real power supply. You can feel the difference in the weight, which translates to improper shielding and heat-sinks.The new unit did indeed power up my Wii, but causes an electronic pulse (looks like a static bar) through my television that makes it impossible to play any games.Not I've wasted my money, and have to find another vendor, since I can't use this item."
1,Why not just be truthful about the product in the description.,"The listing stated that this item was an 'Official Nintendo Wii' charger. The charger they sent is clearly not. It's half the weight and quality of an original.I don't mind if an item is not an official item, but list it so. Blatant lies in a listing needs to be addressed by Amazon.When contacting the seller multiple times, you get absolutely no response, so I had to open a case against them. Lets see how that goes."
2,"A stilted, vapid effort. Very disappointing.","After hearing the terrific songs ""So Unsexy"" and ""Hands Clean"" on the radio, I rushed out and bought what I hoped would be a smart, energetic, insightful CD. What I discovered instead was Alanis Morrissette basically recycling the same music she used on her ""Jagged Little Pill"" CD. Only this time, her lyrics are more obtuse, less accessible, and less compelling. There are a few bright spots on the CD, such as the songs I mentioned. But, overall, the CD is rather negligible and self-involved. I believe only die-hard fans of Morrissette's will get any real mileage out of this vapid collection. (Ironically enough, I purchased Lisa Loeb's new CD ""Cake & Pie"" the same day I bought this one, and that CD surprised me by being the musically superior to Morrissette's effort. So if you want some great new chick rock, check out that title.)"
4,a wonderful mess,"It's Morrisett’s hesitancy to bend to the conventional, melodic lyrical arrangements that makes her refreshing. She challenges the norm, by pushing in way too many words than the common songwriter would allow herself. Truly brilliant!It's her gorgeous stream of conscious writing that got me hooked, especially on Jagged Little Pill, on tracks like ""Not the Doctor"" (I don't want to be your food/ or the light/ from the fridge/ on your face at midnight) and ""All I really want” (My sweater’s on backwards and inside out/ and you say/ how appropriate). They're simple, everyday, and straightforward, without being precious. And her delivery allows it all to be a weird, disjointed lyrical delight."
2,Better Left Under The Rug,"Alanis Morrisette's third studio effort opens with her essaying to us the twenty one things she wants from a lover--another in a long line of ""overshares"" this once compelling artist foists on her seemingly adoring fans. As with her sophomore effort, only to a greater degree, Morrisette manages to bog down her potent melodies with cluttered, New Age garble--it's criminal that she has such a way with a hook, considering that she continues to betray her own best efforts with her overly verbose, undisciplined style of songwriting. Tracks such as 'Hands Clean' and 'Surrendering' chug along with terrific urgency--until you attempt to listen to the lyrics. In fact, about two minutes into each track, you'll be scratching your head wondering""When is THIS song going to end?"" It makes one long for the days when this screaming banshee was singing about going ""down"" on her lover in a theater. Do yourself a favor, sweep this under the rug--and leave it there."
5,Awsome!,"First, I must disagree with everyone who says Alanis' second studio cd, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was a flap. It sold over 10 million copies worldwide with 3 million in the US alone. You can hardly call that a flap.Under Rug Swept is great. It has gotten a lot of criticism because of its heavely lyrical content, but the critisicm is not desearved. All of the reveiws I have read fail to mention that awsome music. It seems as if the reviewers only read the lyric book and did not even read the cd.This cd rocks! You wont be disappointed. As for highpoints, every song is perfect!"
1,Not a good CD,"Alanis still has a lot of growing up to do both as a person and artist.There is still too much cynicism,attitude and tiring talk of relationships and boyfriends gone bad in her lyrics.Plus she tries too hard to be intellectual,it doesnt work.This CD stinks."
1,annoying,"Alanis Morissette has one of the most irratating singing voices I have EVER heard. I would literally kill myself if I ever forced to listen to her music for an hour straight. If you want to listen to some annoying chick yodel, buy this piece of crap people call music."
4,Continuing to Impress..,"As with her previous project, Alanis has once again shown that she is growing both as an artist and as a person. The angry white female ""recovering"" from childhood and a series of bad relationships is perhaps even less present on this album then on the follow-up to Jagged Little Pill. Alanis once again delivers with her unique ability to combine melodic riffs and enchanting hooks with powerful lyrics that will stay swiming in your head long after you are done listening. Perhaps the only negative is that the stream of consciousness lyrical style is a little difficult to keep up with at times as it has a tendancy to babble a bit."
2,She should of stuck with Glen Ballard,"Her previous 2 albums with producer Ballard were much more unique and raw. This being the first time she's writing the guitar work, it sounds similar to a garage band, but I can tell she has learned alot from her work with Glen. And I would prefer not to have a musical diary of her every relationship and trama. This albums songs could no way be as fun to see in concert, but I may be surprized. This sounds alot like her work on the Canadian albums. But Alanis rocks! I saw 6 times on her last tour and hope to see more this time around. Rock on Alanis & Nick Lashley!!"
2,Alanis is still blah,"Jagged Little Pill was great, but since then Alanis has just churned out three albums with nothing new to offer, little inspiration, and lyrics that aren't particularly poetic or interesting and overwhelm her music with their sheer bulk. This album is one of those three."
4,Really great,"I picked this CD up along with the new CD. I am glad I did because this is a really great CD I had been missing out on all of these years. Alanis' CD's may not have more than 12 tracks often but the songs on the CD are quality tracks. My favorite tracks are ""Narcissus,"" ""Precious Illusions,"" and ""Hands Clean."" I am surprised that Alanis didnt' get more critical acclaim and award recognition for this CD because its great and the production is awesome. The track for ""Narcissus"" bumps."
3,"Musically decent, lyrically tiresome","After loving Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, I was hoping for something a little more unlike Jagged Little Pill. Under Rug Swept stands on its own musically, but lyrics-wise, it's the same self-absorbed trip. A track called ""Narcissus"" is the final straw. Who is this material directed at? Women who have been totally worked over by horrible guys? Are normal guys who treat their wives and girlfriends with respect expected to listen to this...? Maybe Alanis doesn't think such men exist. If I want to hear endless litanies about my deficiencies as a male, I'll hang out with my ex-wife. I guess this is why I prefer women artists like Bjork and Jane Siberry."
3,it's ok for a highway trip,"Hi, i like alanis morissette, she has very good songs, unfortunately none of them are in this album, the first song I can't get to hear it to the end, the rest of the disc is good, i have just heard it on a road trip, the audio quality is great, the tracks from 2 to the end of the disc are nice to listen while you drive, maybe if I analyze more the lyrics my perception will change but after this first try, the album ""is ok""."
1,Blowing smoke...,"I'm sorry to say that I really thought that this audio bok was dull and annoying. I have red every one of King's books, enthusiastically waiting between releases for the next title. He is an amazing writer. However, this project was quite the failure. I was irritated by his reading and bored by the contents. I would like my money back. Sorry Stephen!"
1,"Waste of time, money, and attention.","Stephen King is great. I even like his voice. But I have never felt more money-screwed than when I shelled out 20 bucks for this box of audio tripe. These three shorts have to be the absolute FLATTEST stories in his otherwise estimable body of work.Jeers, Mr. King! Kindly send me my money back. You can pick up your tapes next to the roadkill or the median or wherever the hell it is they landed when I chucked them out the car window going 75. Booo!"
1,Upside down is not rightside up,"This video is NOT for beginners!The video begins with a warm-up routine that lasts forever. Let's get on the pole! That's what I bought the DVD for!So, the next segment ""breaks down"" the combos. There isn't any way to quickly move from combo to combo and the steps are shown twice. That's it. Twice.And lastly, at least three of the combos involve introversion. Upside down is not for beginners. I almost broke my neck.Save money and stay out of the ER. Don't buy this video!"
1,"Seek out a copy of ""Lord Of The Two Lands"" instead","When I heard that Judith Tarr was writing another book involving Alexander the Great, I eagerly awaited its publication. Instead I found it a huge disappointment!! I enjoyed much of her first book about Alexander, ""Lord Of The Two Lands"", but her latest book is a sorry conclusion to her Alexander story. Her writing style comes across as forced and awkward, and the surprise twist that occurs two/thirds of the way through just made me groan and want to throw the book to the side. (Even though I saw that 'surprise' coming after the first few chapters, I had hoped I would be wrong and it would turn out to be a TRUE surprise, but no such luck!). I found this to be a ridiculous attempt at Alexander fiction, and such a great historical figure deserves better than to be such an insignificant character and no more than a goofy plot device. Skip this one and seek out her first Alexander novel for a much better read."
2,Ocean's 11 original,"I was thoroughly excited to order this movie because i had been going crazy for the new ocean's movies, and i also love the rat pack and am into old movies. I was impressed with the quality of the actaul dvd and casing, but the movie itself was a let down...the ending was ironic, but lack of plot build up and execution was a huge problem."
3,The Rat Pack in Hack,"This movie has two things going for it: first, it has the Rat Pack involved in a Las Vegas crime caper, which means it glows with a certain glamourous intrigue; second, it's more a character study than a technical how-to treatise, which means it's better than the recent remake. The picture's problem is that it's dated in a way that doesn't hold up well. Its Playboyistic slickness, which came to pass for sophistication in many sixties flicks, imparts an aura of parody that bloats the pacing and results in a plodding, strained storyline. Had the film been done ten years earlier, it might have been made as noir, and the Rat Pack could have been great in that genre! (Sinatra, for one, proved such mettle in Suddenly and Manchurian Candidate). Nonetheless, the movie does have its noirish moments, and Rat Packers should be able to hang in there even when the ship seems to be sinking in slough."
4,Ocean of Nostalgia and Stars,"When shown on network television padded with commercials, OCEAN'S 11 seems to run on forever (approx 3 hrs) and the pacing is too slow. However, when shown on cable or on DVD/Tape without the interruptions, the movie flows much better. This is a pretty good caper film. Also, now that there has been a resurgence in interest in the swingin' early sixties concerning the ""Rat Pack"" the movie has become somewhat of a classic. No need to list the participants, the plot, or the great surprise ending. Overall, a fun movie to watch with a great cast and a nostalgic look at the early sixties before the advent the Kennedy assassination, the Vietnam War, the Beatles, and the whole sixties counterculture. It is too bad that the interest in the ""Rat Pack"" has not done anything to release another one of their movies on tape or DVD, and that is the film, SEARGENT'S 3 that is under some red tape because of its source material, GUNGA DIN."
1,HORRIBLE,"This book was a waste of time. Not funny at all. I may have chuckled a few times, but overall it was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. If you want to read a funny book, get a George Carlin book."
4,Great fun,"Pure Drivel is the type of book most people could sit down and read in a single sitting. I tried that at first, but the spark of Martin's comic genius seemed absent. So instead I put the book away for a few days, then came back to it and read the essays one at a time. And what a difference it makes! Martin has always proven that he is a man with varied acting talents. And this book adds an impressively witty literary side. Although I had never read any of the pieces when they were originally published, I can imaging that I would have enjoyed some of the more topical essays had I done so. Martin is at his best when he loses the yoke of news commentary and decides instead to unleash his comedic insight into everyday life. My favorite pieces were - Writing is Easy!; Yes, in My Own Backyard; Times Roman Font Announces Shortage of Periods; The Nature of Matter and Its Antecedents; and A Word from the Words. END"
2,it is.... pure drivel,"Well.... I can't say I was disappointed as I didn't have high expectations for this one. Parts of the book were very good but much of it was just a waste of time. It is a very short read, so makes a good bathroom book."
2,I laughed about 3 times,"After enjoying Steve Martin's work from years ago ""Cruel Shoes"", I was very excited to get this book. I am a huge fan, but I was disappointed. It had it's moments, but was way over the top with eccentricity. If you like comedic books, A much better buy would be Garry Shandling's ""Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host"". It is hysterical."
2,This book delivers what it promises.,"I can hear Steve Martin's carefully timed delivery in each paragraph. I can see the (fake) arrow through his head and hear the beat of Egyptian music in the background. I can see the wild-and-crazy guy strutting his stuff in the 70's bar scene. So I got some good laughs. If the reader lacks the ability to roll these flavors together in this dish, I'd wait for the video. For Fans Only! Too little for too much."
3,Not Oil Rubbed Bronze!,"I love the shape of these faucets and they look great! However, they are not oil rubbed bronze. They are BLACK! My husband assembled them one evening while I was not home. As of right now, we still have them in our newly remodeled master bathroom but I am very unhappy with the color! Everything else is oil rubbed bronze! I wish I knew who to write to about this! It is not the easiest thing to install and uninstall faucets. If you don't mind them being black you are all set with this!"
4,How to care for Aging Parents,"This book is in great condition but print is Blue instead of Black - not as easy to read as I would like. Still, a great bargain for a book recommended by a therapist who specializes in aging issues and relationships with family."
4,Two sides of Globalization,"In this account of Globalization, Friedman states that the free-flow exchange of technology, information, and finance is leading to a vastly inter-connected globalized world. On one hand lie the laisse-faire free for all, profit seeking, arbitrage exploiting optimists and marketeers and on the other lie the traditional, religious bound, skeptics. Written pre-9/11 this text accurately described the rift between the two viewpoints of modern advancement. However, Friedman failed to see the many nuances inherent in this globalized world, creating a market based catchphrase metaphor with little substaniary case studies to back it up. Having read this, pre 2001, it was very revelatory and perspectively macro-shifting for its time-period."
1,There are better books out there.,"I really dont understand why Thomas Friedman deserves all the accolades for this book. I read a lot of it for an Economics class at school, and then compared it with the Wall Street Journal at the school library. Mr. Friedman's observations, though humorous, do not lend particularly well to the UNDERSTANDING that people should have from the book. Indeed, I would recommend the WSJ to people over Mr. Friedman's work."
3,Should have been a magazine article,"I am a big fan of Friedman's ever since ""From Beirut to Jerusalem,"" because of his insights and style. ""The Lexus and the Olive Tree"" has some critical insights into globalization, expecially for the uninitiated. As importantly, the book is about how power has been redefined in the current instant-information age. The main problem with the book is that it could have been a magazine article; most of his points have been made within the first few chapters, and even then are longwinded. It seems as if someone said ""hey, this would be a great book"" and that a lot of needless padding went on as a result. Unfortunately this seems to be a modern publishing trend, I felt last visited in Kunstler's ""The Geography of Nowhere""."
1,Another book on globalization,"Hmmm...globalization...now there is a vacuous concept that lots of ""intelligent"" people throw around to explain things they're too stupid to think through. Ever notice how no one ever gives us a definition of globalization? Basically, its just the lowering of transaction costs and guess what kids, its been around since the beginning of human history. Leftists find the concept useful to scare people -- ""Look! The globalization monster is sneaking up on us to lower our standard of living, create massive unemployment and make everybody miserable."" (Oh, wait, that's not happening.) What ever happened to the leftist cry of internationalism? This book gets a big ""DUH!"" and so does the guy worried about endism (another useful concept). Am I an endist? I like to finish what I started, so I must be (Fukuyama aside)."
3,Intro to International Political Economy,"While Friedman's style is insightful for a 500 word column in a New York Times editorial, this style expanded into a 500 page book makes for a tiring reed. The constant heckling of anecdotes that reiterate its positions over and over again becomes trite. In one position, he will quote ambassadors of this country and CEOs of this company, all usually starting out, ""As I sat down to tea with the CEO of Compaq."" However, his philosophy and explanations are well-versed and thought out. His theories make sense but the style becomes aggravating."
1,A Book based on Fictional Dialogues is PURE FICTION!,"Having read and re-read this book for my doctoral thesis on the Global Economy, I find it very difficult to believe someone who MAKES UP ENTIRE DIALOGUES! Thomas Friedman, with this book, is acknowledging that he himself, before thinking about the topic, was a one-dimensional political reporter. Suddenly he undergoes this conversion, SEES THE LIGHT, and understands that economics is a factor in everyday life?The Truth of the matter is that Mr. Friedman is NOT the expert on Globalization. All one really needs to do, the next time you purchase a sporty watch or walkman or appliance, is take a look at the directions / owner manual. If the manual is written in Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish, then you know the manual was printed in SEVERAL countries. When you see that some parts were made in India, and others in Canada, globalization will make more sense. It's better to look at everyday life versus read fictional dialogue from Thomas Friendman."
1,History,"If you want to understand how foolish people were about the Internet and globalization at the end of the 20th century, this is the book for you. You can learn how a brilliant guide to globalization could become the joke of the last century in a matter of two years.""The American stock market was at a record high, American unemployment was at a record low and virtually every study showed that NAFTA had been a win-win arrangement for the United States, Canada and Mexico"" (Friedman, 2000, p336). Oh yeah? I wonder why there is no updated edition of The Lexus And The Olive Tree for 2002.In summary, the book says something like: ""Globalization is not an option, but a must. If you want to globalize, you need to do it fast because globalization is like 100 meter dash over and over. If you do it fast, you will lose your olive tree (identity). It's not acceptable to lose the olive tree."" I cannot make any sense out of it."
3,The best bad book I've read in years.,"If you're expecting something approaching the quality of ""From Beirut to Jerusalem,"" you will be disappointed. That book was a masterpiece of reporting. That book told the story of one man's travels in Beirut and Jerusalem like no other before or since. This book tells... what story exactly? I'm not sure. Perhaps it's intended to be the story of the post-Cold War world, but it extrapolates that tale to the point that a better title might be, ""What Thomas Friedman Thinks Will Happen Next.""Still, I enjoyed it. I recommended it to friends. It has shaped the way I see the world."
3,a journalist's viewpoint,Short and Sweet:Read this if: 1) you like what Friedman has to say in his columns in the New York Times; 2) you want to understand the viewpoint of those opposed to globalization in its present form but who generally think that globalized free trade can be managed in a way that will lift all boats -- it's useful as a constructive criticism that can engage those who are horrified by street protests. Don't read this if: 1) you are continually amazed by Friedman's western bias and simple thinking in his columns; 2) you have no interest in getting off of the streets.
3,Don't worry everything will work out all right,"Well at least according to this guy it will. I have my doubts. He seems to have walked into the Middle East assuming that everything will work out in the end, and then tries to prove it is true by only listening to what he wants to hear."
4,Good translation..,"I picked Stephen Mitchell's version of the Tao Te Ching after reading the Feng-English translation.After reading some of the more negative reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised.This version is easy to read and understand, clearing up the more esoteric passages from the traditional translations, without diluting the underlying meaning and inspiration.I still prefer the Feng-English translation for it's poetic style and mysticism, but Mitchell's version is still ideal to enjoy and ponder the meaning of the Tao."
5,Mitchell makes the essence available to contemporary eyes,"Reading this, as other Mitchell works, I am delighted and grateful that this ageless wisdom is communicated with penetrating intelligence, reverence, humor and, above all, love. This Tao Te Ching is a marvellous and endless feast, wholly edible and enlightening. Thank you."
3,"confused, but looking for a good read","CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT? I wanna read The Starseed Transmissions and this book, I haven't yet, but I would like to know what they're actually about. If it's about making your own religion or some hippie crap like that, I don't wanna read it, but if it's a good read and isn't all poems, then I'd very much like to give it a read. somebody email me at drkatzfanman@hotmail.com and give me your review and tell me whats up please! thanks a lot."
4,Majesty,"Tao Te Ching Stephen MitchellSubtle contradictions of thought that neutralize each other.A centering of the ball, so to speak like a ball in a turn and slip indicator in a light aircraft.Step on the ball left or right bringing it to center, irregardless.Tao: calming, contemplative, restfull bits of information providing a majesty available for us all.Johnny G. (Americanworkmule)"
3,"Nice tidbits, but too compact","I wanted more from this book...it was like reading a few tidbits of wisdom that, although sometimes hard to understand, make you think...but it was all so brief and choppy."
2,Ive read better,"I was looking for a specific version of the Tao this was not it, and sometime a bit confusing compared to the other version I have read."
1,Not even close,Buyer beware ... The Tao te Ching is one of the most translated books in the world. There are better translations out there. Look elsewhere.
2,"Good Poetry, Bad translation","This ""translation"" is good poetry and nice to read but as a translation of a book of wisdom it has lost most of its value. It is now a highly interpreted Tao Te Ching. It has lost its authenticity. It is like taking the Bible and highly editing it. Anyway, I have read at least two other translations which I found much better because they leave the interpretation to the reader. These books have footnotes with author's helpful notes, etc."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"I am so angry that I spent my money on this useless, non-phonetical, horribly-accented piece of CRAP!WHY didn't I read the reviews BEFORE I bought it???"
4,Install Issues,These are a great buy for the price! However I had a professional plumber install and he even had problems getting the product installed. I am not able to use the lever to stop the drain. I dont care if I needed it I can reach under the sink. The swivel is GREAT! I will not use the oil rubbed bronze in any other room in my home due to keeping it clean. It leaves a residue if you do not wipe it clean after use. Having it my master bath only is fine and looks nice. Would not use in my kitchen or any other bathroom. I thought it looked great but I would stick with the Nickel finish if I could do it again.
1,Disappointment in a box.,"Don't get me wrong here, I love Word Perfect and have been using it since version 6.2a. I would never give up using Word Perfect completely, but this version just didn't run.I had decided to upgrade my old version of Office 11 to X3 because I would finally be compatible with the computers used by my college. It was a much anticipated upgrade that I was very excited about. However, it did not run on my shiny new PC, and Corel's customer support could not find a way to avoid repeating themselves when trying to help me. In the end it never did run, and now Presentations 11 doesn't work anymore and instead of importing my old macros from Quattro, it deleted them all.It's been sent back. I have no use for software that doesn't run, and little sympathy for software that kicks the older version apart and *still* doesn't run. If you have version 11, just keep it. The upgrade doesn't actually work like it claimed to."
1,Quattro Pro X3 too buggy for words,"QPX3 cannot handle dialog box objects correctly. Oh sure, you can spend hours building a dialog box, and even test it OK, but if you try to go back and edit it some more the dreadfully misnamed Corel Application Recovery Manager (really a bug report gatherer) rears its ugly head. Even tabbing from one field to another in a dialog box will crash QPX3. And worse, any time a dialog box is on screen your CPU usage pegs at 100% until the box is closed, so even if you do manage to build something QPX3 will eat your CPU. On a laptop this just drains the battery and makes the fan kick in. There are numerous errors in the help documentation. Some are merely typos. Some things just plain don't work, such as the INDICATE macro statement, and it isn't marked obsolete like many of the other macro statements. This is a zero star program, don't waste your time."
5,Love It!,"My hair stylist used this on my hair years ago. Of course, I can't do it as well as she did. I sat under the dryer after applying it for a deep condition. It left my hair very soft. I wear my hair short but it left it full looking."
5,Lovely Scent,I am very pleased with the product. I love the scent and receive lots of compliments. I think one of the best compliments is when someone tells you you smell nice.LAVANILA Vanilla Blossom Natural Fragrance
1,Don't waste your time and money,The author needs remedial courses in physics and in the scientific process. What could have been an excellent story turns out to be a predictable and technically laughable story. This book is best left on the store shelf.
3,Where are you Clive?,I should be charitable and say a nice first effort. It seemed a little to strong a Cussler novel than I thought it would be. I guess it is hard to show different if you are broke in by the Master Mr. Cussler. I don't want to be to negative as this is his first. The last one hundred pages seemed to lead you away instead of toward a ending. Practice makes perfect so keep on writing. I will try one again.
5,"The ""Real Deal""","I am a bass player of over 30 years, and a Jaco fanatic. Of Jaco's unfortunately short career, and even shorter period when his greatness peaked before the drugs and fame of Weather Report (in combo with other factors)began his tragic spiral downward, this is some of the greatest and most important Jaco you can get. All the world famous grooves to come can be found in their raw fresh form here. This is a must have for any Jaco student or appreciator. By the way, to whom it may concern at Amazon, this is a STUDIO recording not live!!"
2,Horrible Sound Quality,"I bought this cable over some other pricey ones I saw in a store, thinking they are all the same. But NO!!! Please please do not buy cheap firewire cables. While transferring priceless videos of my son's activities, i found out why this cable is CHEAP. The video quality was ok but the sound was completely messed up. I confirmed it with several transfers and all of them had jerky sound quality. A little extra money is definitely worth it."
3,Belkin cable,"A quality product and the price is right, however the wire is way too stiff due to the shielding. A 3' cable does not require this much shielding."
4,Pretty useful cable,"I am happy with the performance of the cable so far. The process of capture video from my MiniDV camera is always easy and fast. This cable is good enough for me, but still I think I should have got the longer one."
3,It's a cable for god's sake...,"It is a decent cable, it does what you pay for, though its really hard (the coating of the cable).Nothing extraordinary."
1,It's cheap for a reason,"If you are using Quickbooks, or Autocad or most likely any other application that relies heavily on registry information, be prepared to reinstall them from scratch if you allow Registry Repair to ""fix the errors"" it found. The backup & restore facility WILL NOT undo the changes made to the registry and restore it to the pre-repair condition.I have seen viruses do less damage to Windows.Do not use."
2,Not so much,I love this brand's shampoo. I use the shampoo to cool my high lights. The conditioner is a big disappointment because it doesn't really condition. I add a little to my regular conditioner to cool the high lights but it is ineffective when it comes to moisturizing and smoothing hair.
1,yuck,"As far as a conditioner this is just ok, not a bad one, not a great one. The smell though is AWFUL. It smells like old lady perfume x100. I used it only once at night and the following morning washed my hair with a different shampoo... I can still smell the horrible scent, buyer beware."
3,Updated review...won't buy it again...,"To be used with the Clairol Shimmer Lights Shampoo....contained in another of my reviews.Can be used together with the Clairol Shampoo or as a follow up to another shampoo of quality.Again it is purple and will temporarily stain towels etc. It has a drying effect. Gets rid of some brassiness.After using for some time, I would not purchase it again."
1,Missing product information,"After using this product for one week it turned my silver hair a bluish-purple color. I should have been suspicious when I saw the color of the conditioner was purple. No where in the advertisement or promotion of this product does it state ""use will turn your hair a bluish-purple color"". I remember when this was a fad with older women years ago. Obviously Clairol still has a lot of shampoo and conditioner left from those days they want to get rid of. If you have blonde or silver hair, beware! I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,This company's delivery time is very slow...,Just be ware that this company delivers their stuff really slowly... I ordered other items from other vendors and this vendor took 4 extra days to deliver their stuff.
3,Parents use care,"Parents may want to pre-read this before they give it to their kids. Not only does this book deal with the question of moral wrongs, but it also uses illustrations of violence against slaves. Every family sets their own guidelines for what their young children should see.One of the best things this book does is open up the conversation about revolution - is it morally right to hack and bludgeon your oppressors (and their children) to death as they sleep? Is it moral to repay evil with evil? The book does a good job setting up both sides of the question.The Nat Turner of this book is a bright man, a preacher and a leader, a man who sees visions. He is not portrayed as a crazed lunatic, but as thoughtful man who struck a blow against slavery."
5,Really a great deal!,"I was somewhat leery, not really believing what I read... but WOW.I received my jacket and rode with it for a few months.I ""softened"" it up a bit and love it! Its great and the zip out lining makes it good for use well into our chicagoland winter weather!"
1,Review of: BlackHawk Down,"BlackHawk Down was a great book. The reason i thInk this is because it was writen in a way that it put you in the action, it made me feel like i was there in the middle of a war.Another reason i liked this book is because it went almost exactly with the movie, and when i read a book i like to be able to watch the movie and there not be a big difference between it and the book. Also not only did the events follow along with each-other there were alot of the same words and the book used alot of detail in sense that it used the abbreviations the army does, it used the same weapons, and the same names of the people who were actually in the war. I highly recommend this book to anyone.RYAN CARNEY"
5,Hoo-ah!@Mogadishu.World,"I am Turning 13 in 5 days, so this book is in no way too difficult for 13 year olds and under. I found the was story fascinating, and Mark Bowden to be a great author. While this book is one of the best I have read, due to the nature of the book (Being a war documentary) I do not reccomend this book to kids younger than 12, those weak to graphic violence, or those that would be offended by objectionable language. Once again, GREAT narrative, a true story of American strength, sacrifice, courage, and honor!God Bless America-Andrew Joyce, 12 +360"
4,"A fine, fine, book but only part of the story","This book is one amazing piece of the larger Somalia debacle.Anyone who reads this book should also take the time to get the rest of the story to place it all in context. Thankfully, Mr. Bowden includes a bibliography. Be sure to read The Road to Hell by Michael Maren to get the picture from the angle of the humanitarian failure. But this is the only book you need from the military perspective."
5,Heartpounding,"This is the first book on battle that I have ever read. I never thought that a book can capture the savagery and adrenaline of war until I read this book. I felt my heart pounding throughout. I saw the movie as well, but it does not compare to the book. Highly recommended..."
4,Good military history,Entering a country to look for a dangerous criminal seems too close now to what Americans are doing in Afghanistan. I sure hope they have better luck.Sad history with no happiness during it and of course no happy ending.
5,Required reading before Afghanistan....,"I first read this book when it first came out several years ago. Exceptionally well written; gripping; page-turner. A true must read (even if you don't think much of military history). This book reads more like a Tom Clancy novel than a non-fiction account of an ""incident"" in a far off land.I plan on re-reading this book over the weekend (yes, it reads that fast!) because it has a lot of parallels for what we are about to get into with Afghanistan. Some underlying themes: 1) Don't underestimate the 'locals' just because they are dirt poor - they are usually well armed and tough fighters, 2)Don't underestimate the hatred the third-world general population feels twoard the U.S., 3)Be patient and give your intelligence gathering operations time to work, 4)If ground troops are involved, be prepared for casualties."
5,Took the day off work to finish it!,"This is an incredible account worthy of the amazing men it chronicals. I wish that every voting-age American would read this book. I really appreciated the way Bowden went the extra mile in detailing his sources and research methods, including other writings on the subject. Wake up America - this is a look at the future of the squandering of military power on feel-good conflicts rather the defense of the US and its interests by bumbling politicians."
5,Belongs in every American's book collection...,"Black Hawk Down is a masterful telling of the Battle of Mogadishu and the bravery of the Rangers, Special Forces, pilots, and Combat Controllers who fought there. The book does a better job than the movie of explaining the situation around the snatch and grab raid that went south. It details the situation in Somalia in the period leading up to the battle in great detail. It makes the story flow better.The writing is done well. Mark Bowden is an excellent writer who manages to capture the sheer terror of being trapped with nowhere to go and no hope for rescue in the immediate future. It was a fight for their lives, and he catches some of that. He also does a nice job of portraying the extreme bravery that was exhibited in that firefight. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a bit of what our fighting men and women experience every day. It's a good book that I couldn't put down any of the times I've read it."
5,Exellent read - action packed and meticulously researched,"This was an awesome read. The book is more about the operation than the politics (although that is covered as well). You really feel like you are on the ground with these guys. I've watched the movie a million times, but the book blows it away. The movie does a great job of following the book - but there are just so many more details in the book and the context much more robust. I found it a little confusing figuring out where they teams were at. There are some maps in the book, but I still got confused - but I get lost in my own house. This was a serious engagement and these men fought courageously and with great skill. It is simply amazing that they made it out alive."
4,A fantastic historical account that reads like a novel.,"This book takes a hard look at the US military and how a group of soldiers, most in thier early 20's, delt with a unimaginable situation. Most people seem to think our men and women in uniform are some kind of automations that only do as they our told. This book gives an incredible and honest account of how these ""automations"" are actual people, with feelings most of us can in one way or another relate to.If you are looking for a historical book that shows the hieghts of human courage and yet the true horror and confusion of war, this is the book for you."
5,"poweful, stirring, perfect","One of a few book I call flawless on my own personal scale. You will not regret reading this book no matter your stance on war today, yesterday or tomorrow."
5,Great and Exciting read,I loved this book from the very first page. Plenty of actionand not so much a history book. I showed it to my friends andit seems the whole school is reading it. Now if a 12 year oldlikes it it must be great.
1,wrong item rec'd.,"I was excited to find such a good price for this game, however I did not get the game I ordered but a different one. I would suggest you be careful. It would cost me more to send this back so I will just keep the game they sent, but I will not order anything else."
2,Perhaps it helps to be an Elliott Smith fan?,"I bought this CD because I liked ""Division Day"" by We Are Telephone when I heard it on Pandora. Plus, I looked at the reviews here on Amazon and was hopeful. That was a mistake.""Rose Parade"" is good. The rest of the covers, to me, lack any real intensity or passion. Based on other comments here, supposedly this tribute was by bands that really like Elliott Smith's music. Somehow I'd think this attachment would produce some flair or heart but if the bands feel it, they don't convey it.Contrary to other reviews, perhaps these songs fail to impress because I am totally unfamiliar with the original versions...perhaps hearing a song you already like, even if done badly, makes it better? I can only speculate, give this CD 2 stars and move on to my next acquisition."
1,Cameta incognito 1000,"RobertThe closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic. They broke after only using it one time just by normal open and closing. .The bag is unusable and worthless without them.... .Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do. This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.This bag would be great if they would just spend a few more dollars on bertter snappers, They should all be sent back to the company that made them."
4,Pathways - a must for all Voyager fans,I am just about finished Pathways and I have throughly enjoyed reading about all the characters and what they did before they joined Voyager. This book helps the fan really understand the characters and their weaknesses.
2,not TOO bad...,"The previous book by Jeri Taylor, MOSAIC, told the story of Kathyrn Janeway very well, but if you're looking for THAT kind of insight into the other Voyager characters in this book, you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong... you will find out things about the characters, but the portraits are relatively two-dimensional. It's like eating one potato chip..... The surrounding story is weak at best, and is too easily dispensed with."
3,Group Therapy?,"This is one of those books I enjoyed, but still found serious fault with at the same time. The point of the story is to tell the backgrounds of some of the main charachters of voyager. In that, it does quite well. I found the stories of each of the charachters to be well writen and invigorating.However, the way it was presented.....the crew captured and held in a prison camp, and to pass the time they tell the stories of thier life which led to becoming part of the Voyager crew. It just doesn't seem right. Some technical problems as well, I seriously doubt the method used to escape would have been possible in those conditions.Secondly, it was a bit on the sappy side in the transitions between stories. I was almost expecting a big group hug in parts. Thirdly, some of the stories don't match up with the series.....perhaps the book was written before those episodes were made? Dispite these problems, it was an enjoyable read which gives insight into the crew of the Voyager."
3,Not nearly as pick-up and readable as Mosaic,"After reading Mosaic, I was desperate for more Jeri Taylor. I had to wait for Pathways to be published and launched into it straight away. It may be that starting off with Chakotay was not a good idea, because it turned me off the book. I took it on holidays to force myself into reading the rest of it and I found that you can quite easily just pick out the bits you want to read and read them. You don't have to read the book in any kind of linear order and that is good. Overall though, I think it fails to deliver on the back of Mosaic. It is just not in depth enough. Nice try but no cigar. Jeri Taylor can do better!"
5,Excellent,"I bought these wipers 18 months ago and they are still working well. They even made it through one of the worst winters in the history of Cleveland, OH. Definitely worth the price."
5,Favorite Flavor.,You cant beat this flavor. The texture is splendid and very nice for a snack any time of day. Enjoy!
5,AWESOME,Probably the best beef jerky I've ever had! The country cut is just so moist and flavorful. If you like beef jerky it is a must try for anyone!
5,If you are A songwriter - YOU NEED IT!,ANY SONGWRITER WHO HASN'T READ THIS BOOK IS AN AMATEUR - If you want to look and sound like a pro - this book is the FIRST STEP.
5,favorite writter,"I first read this book in Jr. High and thought I would love to go back down memory lane, its even better as an adult to fully grasp his meanings of the times. It depicts what it was like back in the old hard days for our people, yet it has his great sense of humor on display."
4,nice real nice,this product came in nice; an a real ly good; job and the service was nice ;And the shoe was in good form. the product was great .yes i would buy again here.
4,Well written book,This book is very well written with good set of exercises. The explanations are simple and clear. The author does a good job of keeping the reader progressing through the major concepts without derailing into grammatical trivia.
5,In. Credible.,"Flights of scientific fancy firmly grounded (usually) in facts and figures. Almost every page is pure gold and many have me thinking ""Hmmm...I wonder..."" If you think you might like it, buy it. You will love it."
3,Can anyone tell me what happened in this story?,"Peter David is my all-time favorite ""Star Trek"" author, but this time he has a story that ranks under what I'm used to rating him on. And, I think it has to do with Peter collaborating with another person, a person who has no prior experience in writing, as far as I know. Peter David needs to write his books like he always has...alone! Keep John de Lancie out of it.I had trouble actually understanding what was going on. Yes, I know Lady Q and little q disappear, making much of the story Q's quest to find them, but what was the rest of this story about? Picard coming to grips with his Locutus character was one thing, Q meeting up with the M Continuum was another, but where did all of this come into the end of the universe?In all, this is a bit of a disappointment. It's more like John de Lancie did the writing, and Peter David only supervised some, if at all. As I said, Peter David needs to write his stories his way."
4,Q finds that he is not at the apex of existence.,"I've read all of the reviews before mine and I get the distinct impression that most people did not understand the ending. Or was it that they do not want to understand the ending? The seemed very clear to me.In order to understand the book you have to understand what Q is supposed to represent. Q is thought to be at the highest level of existence in his Universe. He thinks he is omniscient and omnipotent. Through out the book, he is desperately trying to hold on to his feelings of superiority. In the end, he finally realizes that there is a power greater than him. The irony is that that said power had the same problem the Q continuum has; it is bored to death. The point of the plot is to show that there is always someone greater than you, there is always someone who knows more than you."
4,Quility for the professional,"I have not experienced any issues with the handle holding the blades securely. The Felo handle has better ergonomics than the Wiha system 4 handle. The Felo also accepts Wiha system 4 blades, as there are more choices available from Wiha including nutdrivers. My only complaint is the box, it would be more useful if it had additional space for blade storage."
2,Must be a lot of stuff to sweat if you look at the marketing,"If you do a search on ""sweat the small stuff"" you'll find so many titles it boggles the mind. I find some things here useful but where are the references? Do I do this just because? Did Dr. Carlson's Ph.D. appear out of thin air? No, I think you learn that these time proven principles were concieved by greater minds. ""An aim is not the only fortune worth finding; and it is not to be found in foreign lands but in the heart itself."" - Robert Louis Stevenson.If you want to read a book with substance AND references, read Self-Help Stuff That Works by Adam Khan. No big marketing campaign there, just good solid principles backed up by research and tested by time."
4,Great Advice,"This book was great at really targeting all the self destructive things we do and don't realize. Although it was at times repetitive, I recommend this book to anyone who needs a little reality check on what is important in life. Happiness."
5,Just let it GO!,"Love the book, if you're stressed, find yourself angry often, frustrated, tired. This is your pick me up. We are not meant to have all the negative energy around us, so we must consciously create the positive energy we want to have. Enjoy!"
1,Didn't you already say that?!?!?,"When you first start reading the book, it's quite enlightening...that's the first chapter. After about the first three chapters, I started having serious deja vu. There are only so many ways you can say the same thing before the reader catches on. Another thing, who in the heck is going to get up 4 hours before they need to, to meditate?!? I tend to like sleeping laying down instead of sitting up. And if I have 4 hours to spare, I'm surely not going to use it staring out a window. This book seemed to dwell on the passive nature in people. While he did say that sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe in (BRAVO, finally a statement that doesn't tell you to be a wimp), he had so many other wishy-washy walk-all-over-me statements that anything he said worth noting was tossed to the side because of the unrealistic ideas he repeats so frequently. The one good thing that I can say about this book is now I can tell my friends I read a 40 chapter book in 6 hours."
4,Simple and Helpful Advice,"This book eventually turned into a series, and not all of the books are as good as this one. I recommend ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff"" because it is an excellent reminder of how we human beings tend to blow everything out of proportion (... and it's all small stuff).Gudjon Bergmann, author of Living in the Spirit of Yoga (2010) and The Seven Human Needs (2006)"
5,A gentle reminder of how life is supposed to be lived!,"Richard Carlson is a wonderful and insightful writer. This book is such a comfort that I'm looking forward to reading again, and again."
3,Easy-to-read summary of stuff you've heard before,"None of the stuff was new to me, but it was nice to have it all summarized. A little talky, but it did the job. I find its immense popularity, however, a bit of a mystery. I find appalling that this author who promotes ""more is not better"" and other such stuff is planning on writing a guide to financial success. Isn't that a bit hypocritical?"
4,It makes you think!,This book is easy to read and it really makes you think about the meaning of your life. We all know what is important in our lives but this author gives practical examples to achieve peace in every day living.
4,Don' t sweat the small stuff,This book is a very easy read. It has a lot of good information for anyone wanting to do a little self improvement. I would recommend this book to anyone.
2,"Works Well but Cheap Plastic, Poorly Design. Count on it Breaking.",My 3rd and last Boom snapped and is unuseable. The first went right away and was replaced under warrantee. This one lasted a year. Problem is that the earbud is connected to the boom by the thinnest possible sliver of plastic which will fail. Company needs to either make that tiny part out of metal or redesign it so it's not guaranteed to fail. Really too bad since the boom mike works great--clear and very little noise. But it needs to last at least as long as the phone. If it was $39 I wouldn't mind as much but it's $150.
2,Toothpicks only,"I love the idea, and except for one problem, it would be perfect. The problem is the length of the belt. It is only for toothpicks. If you have extra weight on your body, especially in the abdominal area, do not buy this product."
1,nokya 9004 lights,light were dimmer than regular bulbs. lights burnt out to light sockets. called you and you would not take care of problem nor refund my money. changed to pilot bulbs no longer had any problems. poor quality bulbs POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
4,The beautiful voice of Whitney,"An awesome collection from the unique and incredible voice of Whitney Houston. After listening, you quickly understand why we fell in love with her in the 90's. Please Whitney, come back and give us more! Love, Me"
2,Life Strategies? Or Oprah Dedication?,"I did not read the book but opted for the audio cassettes. I was immediately put off that 3/4 of the first tape was dedicated to Oprah and HER lawsuit, how she looked, what she was wearing, how she felt, blah, blah, blah. WHO CARES? What does THAT have to do with ME? I could care less about celebrity and their overblown egos! I continued to listen however, chuckled once or twice, said Mmmmm, interesting a handful of times, but overall disappointed. Mr. McGraw sure would have a lot more credibility with me if he wasn't cow-towing to Oprah."
1,A waste of time so far,I had high hopes. He gets to the point on his show. I thought he'd make the most of the chance to lay out his beliefs. The biggest surprise was his inability to illustrate what's he's talking about. The only concrete example in the sixty pages I read twice was the stuff about Oprah. Thereafter it's just mush. Provocative chapter headings but the text is fluff. Big disappointment. I got a lot more out of Scott Peck's The Road Less Traveled.
1,A dangerous book.,"Puts entirely too much emphasis and burden on the individual in a complex society. Depressed people, those with fragile psyches need to come to terms with their inner reality in a setting of unconditional acceptance. Some might feel overwhelmed and defeated if the stark principles in this book don't work readily in difficult life situations. If this book is empowering to some, that's fine. But many people need a gradual, insightful approach and not the bullying, bruising method this author recommends."
3,"Without buying it, still the chance to get to know yourself.","I got his book after I bought other ""self-help"" books and I liked it a lot more than the others. Okay his style is very direct and rude frequently, but it's to get to you, so you don't stop hiding behind lies and misconceptions. The reason why I gave this review it's title, is because on Oprah.com an online version/ workbook can be found under the name Get Real Challenge, so you still can get to know yourself without spending any money! I've changed my rating, because in the mean time I've read a book called Pulling your own strings by Wayne Dyer and that one was earlier published, but did have a lot of the same ideas, so maybe McGraw has copied it?!"
4,Good Book But Too Much Phil,"This is an excellent book. However, as Dr. Phil recommends in his book, he has an obvious conviction that he is the most important person in his life. The book is filled with, ""you will say thank you Phil"", ""I am telling you because I know"" and other similar phrases.Excellent Content but egotistical writer. The book is also too hard on people, but that is instrumental in achieving the book's purpose. All in all I am convinced with Phil's thoughts and I fully agree with his life strategies. But I do maintain that he is a little too pushy and what could take him a page to write takes him a chapter because of his pushiness; but that again is consistent with his purpose; However, it has caused me to put the book down a number of times at the beginning.Very Helpfull book Phil, but tone yourself down a little bit; you are getting too close."
2,Thought he was more interesting on Oprah!,"I found the book to be not as interesting as I thought it would be since on Oprah he was always appealing and funny. I found that halfway thru the book, I got really bored and all the things he wants you to right down and review was bit to to much to get into. It wasn't a bad book but I wouldn't say it helped me with any life strategies either, I thought the book was just to much work and couldn't keep my interest peaked enough. I do however enjoy his talks on Oprah.."
2,If It Works...Print it again,Yes this is last years calendar reprinted on a poor paper choice. If it is not recycled paper then it is the cheapest paper I have ever used. Otherwise this is a good calendar full of great advise.
4,"Taken with a grain of salt, this is a good motivator...","Get past the ""know it all"" narration of this book, and it can be very motivating. The constant drumming of ""you're responsible for your life and the choices you make"" were a refreshing dose of motivation I needed. Coming from a 12 step program, I find many of the exercises listed were something I did when I actually did the 12 steps. However, after reading so many spiritual books, I really enjoyed being reminded that my life is my responsibility, my choices are my responsibility, and I can make my life the way I want it. I did not do the exercises yet, but I have read 90% of the book, and plan to do the exercises over the next few weeks."
4,laugh all you like,Everybody ridicules me for reading this book. But I think his writing is far better than his TVperformance. It's a very motivating read and it does make sense.
5,Insight Guides to Turkey,Extremely well done and interesting reading even if one has grown up in Turkey and simply wants to refresh memories.
5,Absolute,"I have found the best in art is not so easy, but the rewards of struggle and occasional victory can be life altering. Every single page of To Kill a Mockingbird tells of some enduring truth; I caught a glimpse of what I can only call God in The Color Purple. For me, The Shipping News is in that same strange space, that mortals such as myself only rarely glimpse. As high and cold as the stars or the bottom of the sea, out on a frozen rock in the middle of nowhere, M Proulx gives us a Quoyle, thereby giving us ourselves."
4,Not what I expected!,"I only started to read this book because I needed one (and quickly!) for my english class. After reading the first page, I thought that I would never get past the first chapter, it seemed so boring! But the more I read, the more I got into it. I loved how (in the beginning) Quoyle (the main character) was so insecure and unsure of himself, and how he totally changed. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who is making a major change in their life (like moving, getting over a lost love, etc.) E. Annie Proulx did a great job with this book! She combines humour and wit with whole-heartedness, and a really down to earth concept that anyone can relate to. I found myself reading segments aloud to friends, and I laughed out loud more than once! I will definitely read her next book."
1,This book is as tumescent as a yachtful of mashed yams,"See, I can do Annie Proolxz similes too! I must be a lyrical and talented writer!What did Truman Capote say about 'On The Road?' ""That's not writing, that's typewriting."" He could have been talking about this book. Give your fingers a rest, Annie, or learn to write an elegant, declarative English sentence."
1,Save me from Pulitzer Prize Books,How such a poorly written book won a Pulitzer Prize is beyond me. Gimicky prose with continuous annoying sentence fragments drove me nuts and kept distracting from the story line. Story line was mediocre at best. There was more boring prose about the driveway up to the house than about some characters. At least the movie had some visual stimuli to keep it going. Save the gimick writing and give me some decent readable English.
1,Depressing and Indifferent,"I recently finished this novel...i have to say that i never usually dislike a book to the extent that i disliked this one...and when i heard they were making a movie out of it i was shocked...i did give one star b/c annie proulx's writing style is mesmerizing and lyrical in a unique sort of way...but the subject matter was grey and dull...the plot was lacking something, as well...i only finished this book to see what the final culmination of all of these characters would be like and obviously if u read it, you know...the ending was just as bizarre and dry as the rest of the book...sorry annie...it was a chore to finish this one...kristen from NJ..."
4,Interesting Book...,"In The Shipping News Annie Proulx tells the fascinating tale of love. Obese double chinned Quoyle has never, from the moment of his birth just off-shore off the American coast, experienced happiness. He lives, but only in sub reality, engrossed in a world of torture, where he is only a disposable tool.But suddenly he is freed of his abusers and exploiters in a flurry as his wife dies in a car crash, parents leave his world and the Mockingbird newspaper fires him. Quoyle's first instinct is still to run, but his aunt steps in, recuperates his children and as savior of his life carries him to the land of his heritage, Newfoundland. Now aunt and nephew are set in a barren land to claim two lives that have never before existed.Telling the story of the caricatures which are scorned by society, lives missing and incomplete Proulx brings life to these dummies. A marvelous book, winner of a Pulitzer Prize, The Shipping News zooms through a life, filling us with philosophical inspiration."
2,"Hard, Hard Read","I found Annie Proulx to be an incredible talent. Her ability to convey and portray ideas in a unique way was astounding and something writers should aspire to. The sentences are short and to the point, almost like reading a person's thoughts (a nice change of pace from the overly wordy, breathy, flowery writers that seem to bombard the bookstore). Her ability to portray setting is astonishing. The subject matter however is tough. It's very hard to keep from feeling sad after reading this book. I found myself needing to take a few breaks in-between chapters because I was so overwhelmed with the things that were happening to the characters. The main character is especially heartbreaking.Overall, it was an interesting read, but a person should have Kleenex ready!"
2,Nothing Special,"The Shipping News didn't leave me with a particularly strong feeling either way. Proulx has a unique writing style, which I didn't overly enjoy. The style was quite choppy, which made it hard to embrace the book. In turn, I didn't get involved with the characters, nor did I believe them. For instance, I still do not understand why Petal would ever have married Quoyle. Also, I felt that the description of Quoyle's life was overdone. It was too pathetic to believe. On the other hand, the book is full of subtle humor. The headlines Quoyle thinks to himself were my favorite part of the novel. They were the one aspect of the book that made me want to read on. Thought I wasn't enthralled by the novel, if you want to explore a unique writing style, The Shipping News may be for you"
5,Absolutely fabulous,"I LOVED this book and was so sad when I finished it. It easily joins my ""best books ever"" list. If you're looking for something engaging and entertaining to distract and enjoy this is the book. I have not seen the movie but had pictures in my mind of everything and everyone, the tall and serious woman, everyone. I love that we get to learn part of Quoyle's name in the end. I loved the bits of redemption found in the stark and harsh landscape. Fantastic read. Thanks for writing this, Ms. Proulx."
1,tedious,"i saw one review that compared this novel to those of one of my favorite authors, john irving. not even close... his books are full of intruiging plotlines and characters that make you wish you'd never get to the end of those 600-something pages. this one, in comparison, contains nothing but fragmented description of a mediocre character and the banality of his life. i even liked her sentence structure at first, but that was a novelty definitely not strong enough to carry me through the book, which i finally gave up on on page 307, though i shouldnt have waited nearly that long. this kind of novel apparently appeals to some people, but if you like books that contain characters you actually enjoy reading about and great plotlines, try john irving. not this."
1,Worst Book Ever,"I continue to be amazed people like this book. I found myself growing more and more hostile towards it with each page I read. Since it came so highly recommended, I continued reading, hoping it would get better. No such luck--I want those days of my life back."
5,Stunning,"Proulx perfectly captures a mood I can only describe by asking you to imagine a downward slope. The book as a whole, as well as every sentence, paragraph, and chapter, replicates this shape. As a result, The Shipping News is breathtaking and deep from start to finish."
3,Don't place a book review below an audio version of a book,"When I come to Amazon to purchase or sell a spoken edition of a book, I want to see reviews of the performance or reading, NOT reviews of the book itself which I can find under the description of the printed version of the book.Also, the number of CD's or audio tapes is usually, or often, not mentioned either, and it should be because it is obviously important.I'm sorry to have to place this complaint here, but I don't know where else to post it. If you rate this post as helpful, it might draw the attention of Amazon management. Thanks."
2,A Pulitzer Prize Winner?,"I can hardly believe this book could win a pulitzer prize, yet alone be made into a movie!Our book discussion book really didn't know where to begin our discussion regarding this book. Everyone had the same opinion ""Was there a purpose to this book - None whatsoever."""
1,pretentious and unreadable,"The author's writing style, which I'm sure is supposed to be ""groundbreaking"", is unreadable. I personally found it offensive, affected, and completely pretentious. After 75 pages of frustration, I decided not to waste my time and rented the movie. This proved to be a wise move. For the first time since ""The Godfather"", the movie is actually far better than the novel on which is it based!!!"
2,A very disappointing novel!,"I read the Shipping News and saw the movie on tape. I still didn't get the story. I don't why this author is considered by many to be one of the best authors today. With Brokeback Mountain ready for release, I was curious about this author. While I found mixed reviews, the consensus seems to be that the stories never really have a plot or an ending. I believe it is well written and I enjoyed the characters but I felt it never completely satisfying overall. I still wanted to know what was going to happen. I am sure Proulx is a very good writer but she never really provides an ending to the audience."
3,"Gripping, evocative and memorable","The Shipping News is at times funny, disturbing and sad, but always memorable. In a world filled with desolation there's always hope. It's the hope that rings favorably in this book and the wonderfully crafted marine lifestyles."
2,Diasappointing-especially after all the hype it receieved.,"After hearing so much hype about how great this book was, I couldn't wait to start reading it. And as soon as I did, I couldn't wait to stop. There is no doubt that the writing is excellent, but the content of the book left something to be desired. Try as I might, I could not force myself to become interested in this story, or these characters. Apparently, many people did not feel this way, and therefore I kept trying to discover what it was that everyone found so enjoyable. But after 120 pages, I finally gave up and put the book down."
3,it was okay,"i got this from gamestop for my birthday when i was 8 or 9 and i can see why the original owner turned it in=( it was intresting at the beginning when you chose your riders suit and the horse but barbie is ssssssssssoooooooooo slow and its a pain when at one level its just bridges, bridges and more bridges. it would probably be intresting for someone younger than ...8 it would bore anyone older"
3,80 dollars?????? :-0,"Gosh, I just found out that this easel costs $80! It was a present for Christmas along with other painting stuff. I would never pay such a price!!! In fact, I prefer to paint on the floor and the easel has broken when I bumped it by accident, but I fixed it with glue. Anyway, I think this easel is way too expensive for what it is. I think you can find cheaper at Hobby Lobby or Michael's."
5,Another Decadent Healthy Treat,"These are soft, chewy, lightly nutty and very very good, thus far my favorite of the entire Betty Lou line. The name makes my family and friends laugh, but they get hooked on the taste right away. We are so thrilled that Amazon can deliver us great vegan treats at a great price!"
1,Clematis Polish Spirt Vine,"I received my plant quickly and it was packed very well. Sent by priority mail. I give them an A for shipping. Although the plant appears healthy is so small. The plant was one stem about 9"" high with a few leaves. Don't expect your plant to look like the photo. I was very disappointed in the quality. I don't expect it will mature for a long time, if it thrives and lives that long. I would barely classify it as a plant! I will contact the seller and tell them how disappointed i was and will let you know the outcome."
5,Amazing CD,"If you have never heard Stephen Kellogg and the Sixers, then you are really missing out. Both their music and lyrics are great and have a different sound from the typical performer of today. I have had this CD in my car since it came up over a month ago and it has not gotten old yet. If you like this CD, go see one of their shows, these dudes put on one of the most entertaining shows out there and really respect their audiences. I recently saw them at Jones Beach and they signed CDs during another band's set and talked to fans for minutes.Oh and back to the CD, the best song on the album is 4th of July with all the others coming in at a close second."
5,My favorite instructor and yoga video!,I miss this tape. I no longer have a VHS and was hoping to find this on DVD. Marguerite mixes the perfect blend of relaxation with a physical workout. She is so peaceful and this tape made me love yoga. I wish there were more DVDs of her.
3,More than a 3 but not quite a 4,"This book was fast reading and entertaining, yet I felt there were too many characters and too many things happening. Towards the end when another new character was introduced, it was too much. I didn't think it wrapped up well, either.I will try another on of his books, but he'll have to put a little more substance in his writing for me to become a fan."
2,There Are Better Ways to Spend Your Money,"McBain's 87th precinct books are great but this one is a real disappointment. I found the long, repetitive dialogues dreary and McBain guilty of ""overdwell"". The main story line was to me jagged, jaded and not terribly cohesive (nor very interesting.)"
3,not bad,another reviewer said it got kind of murky and confused toward the middle and I agree. But all in all not bad -- A break from more serious stuff.
5,Great Plane Read,"Some of the stories in this book would probably be most appreciated by those who've been to grad school, but all of them can be appreciated by those who've ever pondered the imprecise nature of love. Iagnemma has a great dry wit and an interesting range. He uses a variety of different time periods and story telling techniques. I found it to be a great plane read."
3,Mystery and magic,"University lecturer and historian Matthew Cavewood has been given a grant to research and write a book on the life and work of Nathaniel Shawcross, a 17th century alchemist.As he probes deeper into Shawcross's life, he has several visitations from a beautiful young woman in 17th century dress and becomes increasingly drawn to her. When he researches herlife, he discovers that she was named Isabel and was hanged for the murder of Mary Shawcross, wife of her lover Nathaniel .Matthew marries Hazel and is happily living with her and her son from a previous marriage when he is encouraged by a faculty member at the university where he works, to delve even more deeply into the lives of Isabel and Nathaniel and, in doing so, is drawn into an obsession with the past which threatens his life and those of his family. If your taste is for murder mysteries with a touch of the occult, you will find this book fascinating."
1,"1 star for the Music CD, 0 stars for the DVD.","This DVD is so bad that the company canned the idea of releasing it by itself, so they decided to release it with the album. I saw this ""documentary"" when it was on TV. Madonna and her new ""English"" accent and ""I'm better than you attitude"" has finally gotten on my last nerve. She used to be a DIVA, now she is just and old preachy hen who wants to shove her Kabalah ways down her fans thoats! Face it, her glory days are long gone and it is only her die hard fans who still hold on to her ""Blonde Ambition"" days who still seem to think she is any good. She has not released a great song in years!There is a scene where her daughter tries to talk just like her mother. She rants on and on, just like Madonna that all of a sudden Roco, Madonna's son, tells his sister to shut up! Well done, now he just needs to tell his mother the same thing!"
3,Concert CD is missing ALOT of songs from the Reinvention Tour!! :(,"Well I absolutely LOVE Madonna, and I was so excited when this cd/dvd was finally released today!Although the sound quality is amazing, I am so dissapointed in the concert CD!I saw Reinvention live in LA & SJ, and she omitted several songs from the CD.It's missing the following:FrozenExpress YourselfBurning UpMaterial GirlHanky PankyDeeper & DeeperBedtime StoryNothing FailsDon't Tell MePapa Don't PreachCrazy for YouHonestly, the songs she left in for the CD were kind of weak-most of songs from ""American Life"", which was not her best album:The Beast WithinVogueNobody Knows MeAmerican LifeHollywoodDie Another DayLamentLike A PrayerMother and FatherImagineInto the GrooveMusicHoliday"
3,I like it but not what im waiting for it!,I like that dvd But We nee also full Re-Invention Tourwhen she will release it?!!I love you madooooona :)
3,SO/SO,"I like this CD but feel with the tons of tracks Madonna performed live on the tour, we could have gotten a few more selections on the audio only CD. I really only purchased this for the DVD. Was a big fan of Truth or Dare and wanted the follow up..."
4,Deceptively simple strategy game,"This is quick strategy game that is simple enough for a child to learn, but challenging enough for an adult to enjoy. The game board itself is an attractive solid oak plank. The playing pieces are authentic looking ""old coins."" The main reason I didn't rate it higher is that when one includes the cost of shipping, it is a bit pricey for a simple strategy game; on the other hand, it is quite an attractive and sturdy game."
5,My absolute Desert Island book,"I don't know how many times I've read this book--dozens, easily, since I first read it about 15 years ago. Not only is it a fascinating read (and Finny's style is exquisitely to the point, capturing every nuance with the casual ease of a major writer) but also the photo illustrations will knock you out--the Statue of Liberty's arm waiting for the body! A wonderful, wonderful book, filled with wonder. Like opening Huck Finn for the first time."
3,"Gives you a feel for ""old Manahattan""","I almost always like time travel books & this was no exception. I think readers who are familiar with modern day Manhattan will find it particularly enticing, as the author has a gift for showing us how it all used to be."
2,"90% nostalgia, 8% romance/adventure,2 % fantasy",I enjoyed most of this. 90% of it is often excruciatingly detailed nostalgia/travelogue of 1880s NYC; 8% is fun romance/adventure and 2% is sci-fi/fantasy.
1,Boring Time Travel Book With Horrible Paradox!,"I thought this book was mostly boring. The first HALF of the book was just the characters talking about time travel. I found the plot dull. The man character, Si, has a girlfriend, who has a mysterious letter from the past. He goes back like 100 years and watched get mailed. Wow, so boring.The last quarter of the book has some exciting moments, involving an 1882 police chase.Then, the most horrible thing a time travel can do is create an obvious time paradox. Si goes back in time and stops this time travel expirement from even happening! Which means Si being in 1882 becomes inpossible!Yea, I didn't like this book. Don't waste you time."
5,total neccesity,"for anyone getting into ""screamo"", this chronicle of this amazing and influential band is a must. buy it now."
5,raw emotion,"i beg to differ with one review of this CD as not being 'emo.' emo stands for emotional hardcore, which is what Saetia epitomizes. this album is full of pure energy and amazing lyrics. Saetia is one of the greatest emo bands of all time and should definitely be explored by anyone who claims to call themselves an emo kid."
2,I need closure!,"Even though Kesey still displays his personal talent for characterization and interest, this book wholly failed.Why? The ending.Yes, one can argue that it is the ride that makes the book, but a failed ending, no matter what, can ruin even the most intruiging story.It's not that I consider the ending of A Sailor Song to be horrible- it's the fact that there seems to be no ending in the first place. Like Seinfeld, I need closure!Even for the ultimate failing, this book still deserves a two-star rating, if only for the story of the Backatcha Bandit. The characters are wonderful, and certainly unique to Kesey. From the reluctant hero to the mutt/Jamaican ladies' man, the characters are certianly colorful enough to keep one's attention.If it's Kesey characters you want, I recommend this book- but don't expect an ending of the caliber of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest- or an ending at all, for that matter."
3,A disappointing buy...,"I was waiting for this cd to come out for a long time, after hearing their singles ""Look Out Below"" and ""Whatever Made You."" I expected an awesome album, but I don't feel that they came through. ""Look Out Below"" is one of my favorite songs, but besides that, nothing really caught my attention."
1,Horrible Bean Bag,The Bean Bag lost its shape after only 4 months of use. The stuffing compressed to the point you might as well be sitting on the floor. No way to get in touch with customer support through Amazon after 30 days.
4,A mix of jazz and Eastern European folk for solo piano,"Milcho Leviev is a Bulgarian jazz pianist, and he normally sticks to jazz, but on this album of solo piano works, he digs a bit more into his Eastern European roots for an odd but pleasant mix of styles. Leviev is a forceful and energetic player, even when playing a ballad, and stepping outside the bounds of straight jazz gives him the opportunity to showcase that ability quite well. This album makes me wish that Laszlo Gardony (a Hungarian jazz pianist) would draw more heavily on his roots.Further listening: Laszlo Gardony's ""Behind Open Doors,"" and Garrison Fewell & Laszlo Gardony's ""Reflection of a Clear Moon."" For a guitar-based mix of jazz and Eastern European music, try the duet albums between Fareed Haque and Goran Ivanovic. Also, Leviev is best in a stripped-down setting, so try his duet album with bassist Dave Holland, ""Up & Down."""
5,SpellFall,I loved this book. It was a good thriller. You could never tell what would happen next. It was hard to put down. I would love to have a second book in the series.
1,Why did I bother?,"I read the first book, Time and Again, and gave it 1 star, so I have no idea why I bothered reading this one. Probably because it involves the Titanic, and I thought that might be interesting. However, I find it more boring that the first book. The first book at least had a bit more plot about it. This book is 95% history and non-relevant storylines, and 5% plot. This shouldn't be labelled as a time travel book. It's a book about historic New York, and they threw in a tiny bit of plot to attract readers."
2,A teen point of view,"Well I don't read many book often but this book sounded nice so I start reading it, I think the story line was pretty good and I realy enjoyed it altough I never had the chance to read ""Time and Time again"", but the book mostly has nothing to do with the main story line that I loved, for exaple try to count how many pages Finney wrote about the act called ""Tessie and Ted"". It was kind of annoying and boring. Also I must say Finney just had to write details about every little tiny thing and that buged me. Well in conclusion I must say the author should had write more about the main story line and much more interensting, if he would had done that I must say I would had give the book 4 stars at least"
3,informative but unneccesarily *lllooonnngg*,"I like how Dr. Dement puts the concept of sleep and its role of necessity and importance in everyday living in simple terms. I no longer under-estimate the importance of good, revitalizing sleep.However: the many painstaking, substantial, and unnecessary digressions into details of his personal experiences really detract from the readability of his work. Anyone accustomed to reading concise, directed scientific writing will find this book very frustrating.I like the message; it's just that it could have been made in one fourth the number of pages! (four stars for content, minus one for lack of conciseness)"
4,Great Read!,"This is an AMAZING book. Very interesting and informative. I had to buy this book for a sleep class, and I liked the book so much I read the book faster than we were assigned to. I got the book quickly, and it was in really good condition."
5,Wonderful Product,"I just finished using the Avery Easy Peel clear address labels for my daughter's birthday invitations. Not only were they easy to print, the labels can be removed easily. When on the envelope they practically disappear; they are truly clear. I highly recommend this product for anyone using address labels but want it to look like the type is right on the envelope. They are perfect!"
4,Convenient and easy to use,"I use several types of labels when mailing, shipping or just labeling items. These I use for printing out mailing labels, labeling household items and as easy to write on folder labels. They leave a neater appearance than colored labels. I don't find that I crinkle the remaining labels on the page like others have commented on. They have a nice look and the ink does not smudge when I put the printed labels on anything. The labels do the job that they were intended to do. They are also good for using to tape things that might require a stronger connection than regular tape can give and they release easier than tape because of their thickness."
4,Good labels,"They're labels. You can print on them. You can stick them on things. As they are clear, they do a nice job of blending into whatever surface you stick them to. What more can be said?"
5,super CLEAR labels,"I love using clear labels on things I like to look really nice. We used these on graduation invitations. I really like Avery labels, as I've never had a problem setting them up to print properly. The print comes out where it should on the label and they look very nice - especially when you can't see them - like with these clear labels."
5,Perfect for Invitations,"We bought these to use on our save-the-date cards and wedding invitations, and they worked out great. Just the right size for regular envelopes, and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you're not using the whole page of labels, and want to use the remaining labels later, take a piece of white paper, and tape it over the labels you are not using. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. It's hard to notice on the page, but once you affix them to the envelope, they can look a bit dirty."
5,"Clear sound, good tunability","Great.Sounds perfect!!!Display capabilities are also awsome.It`s advisable to buy another earphone, it deserves a better one to sound as perfect as it can. I bought a Creative EP-630. Work nicely together, but it sounds the best with loudspeakers.I highly recommend."
2,USER INTERFACE PROBLEM,"The menus are too tiny for 65 year old eyes. There is plenty of room on the screen for bigger more readable fonts.What a shame, the hardware gets 5 STARS from me and it is so much smaller than the magnifying glass that I need to run it.I ain't the only potential buyer that can't see very well.Cowan should shamed into offering an upgrade."
4,"objective analysis, good reading","I have read two other books on Falun Gong, one is Falun Gong's Challenge to China by Danny Schechter and the other one is Wild Grass by Ian Johnson. In fact, I have been to both Schechter and Johnson's book-touring lectures. Chang's book does not have the publicity of either of the two authors. Schechter and Johnson's books are intimate stories and they are trusted by Falun Gong practitioners and are friends of the group. One might argue they are not critical about Falun Gong. Chang's book is much more objective on the group. And she is very articulate on what the group is about. It is a well-researched short study of the topic. In particular, the chapter on the beliefs and practice is well written."
2,Voice builder,The jury is still out on this one. It will take some time to see if it is going to work. I know its quite old and I hope that if the good Doctor ever updates this tutorial that she gets rid of that annoying whining Brit. Paul sends
5,happiness for 4 year old,"I got this for my Grandson for his birthday, so i am guessing at the answers.Mara Lee"
4,Good Book~!,it's help you to easy review every section in Toefl test and there're many practice for u to do it.
2,Horrible,"I used TurboTax for more than 6 years, but this is the last time. I could not import last year's return and could get no assistance to expain why last years information could not be transferred. Only my name transferred, but nothing else. Last year everying went great--what happenned? This is worse than an old Turbo Tax basic that I used several years ago. The Quicken import feature was a disaster. My dependents, and all other information had to be rekeyed. This combined with no rebate, difficulty getting the state return piece and updates that were not current--never again."
2,Bad on rental income,Won't let you choose your depreciation life or to depreciate two separate assets within one rental property (e.g. office building and office equipment). TaxCut does.But TurboTax supports foreign earned income - TaxCut doesn't.
3,OK mostly,The product was OK; I hadn't used it in a number of years. Amortizing mortgage loan points as a deduction item did not work out. The message said it would calc it but never asked for the original loan amount to spread the points against; so there was a missed deduction.Helpful on the capital gains section which is confusing in the federal manual posting.
2,Easily the most boring marketing books ever written,"Imagine you are 8 years old again visiting a brand new theme park. As you walk up to the gates gleaming with excitement, the doors creak open, and instead of a theme park there is a dry, desolate desert of cement. That is exactly how this book feels. Marketing in the modern era shouldn't be boring, yet this book has successfully make a thrilling topic as dry as toast in August, and just as non-palettable.At least the previous edition had some color, this edition is completely monochromatic. I can only imagine how delightful the fifth edition will be in pure black and white."
1,Worst Iron I've Ever Purchased!,"I iron a LOT....Once a week I stand for 4 - 5 hrs. and do all of my ironing at once. Have done this for 30 years and really do like to iron. However, when it was time to replace my old iron, I decided to spend a little more and get the Rowenta because of all the great things I have heard about this brand. Well...I hate the stupid thing!!! When I first purchased it, I could iron for ten minutes before the thing would shut off. No amount of shaking, rattling, moving in any position would make it go back on. I would have to unplug it and then plug it back in. This happened EVERY ten minutes (I timed it). Now it's doing the same thing every 1 minute.If you are thinking about purchasing this iron, I would suggest that you just save your money and buy something less expensive.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
2,Disappointing performance - does not stay on,"When this iron stays on, it works fine. However, it turns off on its own constantly - whether I'm in the middle of using it to iron or not - and it is very difficult to turn back on. The instructions say to shake it to get it to turn on, but I have to shake it very hard and for a long time, and sometimes even this does not work. Very disappointed, especially since Rowenta is supposed to be a good brand."
3,difficult for beginners,"This game is an ok game, like others have said, for younger kids its a bit difficult. One thing tho yoiu do not hae to write down the password after each level, just when you decide you want to stop. This way when you turn the gameboy back on you can get back to where you left off. Dora just needs the glasses to get past the bush or whatever is blocking her path and then you can take them off and see clearly. It is necessary to get al the crystals which can be pretty difficult for the usual Dora fan."
3,Uncertain if it worked,Very hard to tell if this really made any difference or not. Giving it a 2 month try to see if there is any discernible difference in my weight loss.
1,CA Prop 65: This product contains ingredients known to cause birth defects or reproductive harm,"Do not but this. Im sure the vitamins are great, but Im not stupid enough to take them. There's a little bitty warning at the bottom of the label saying this product contains ingredients that cause cancer, birth defects, and/or reproductive harm!! Then why are they made for women???It would have been nice if that was listed on the Amazon page before I spent $20."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad multi overall. I don't think I had quite the energy improvement other reviewers noted though. The price is okay for the size of the bottle when compared to others and while the pills are quite large, they are easy to swallow. If I could find them on the shelves locally I might have continued on these supplements, but it seemed more trouble than it was worth to keep ordering them online when they were really no better/no worse than any other multi of this style on the market."
5,"great value, plays everything","I bought a couple of these as i have some US TVs in India ( which do not work here) so figured at least if i get US spec DVD players i can use the TVs for watching movies. I bought based on the positive reviews , they have lived up to expectations and play anything i put in. Not sure if it has clock or time elapsed display, think it just shows which chapter the disc is on- have not read instructions so maybe it is an option. Size is good , not too deep and reaction speed is good when buttons pressed"
1,Does not work after 1 year,"After 1 year of use I can put it in the garbage! It first started to give error message ""Bad"" and then ""no"".Toshiba has had this pb with other DVD players but does not want to exchange it..."
5,Toshiba all -region dvd player,Excellent - worked perfectly right out the box. For the first time I'm able to play region 2 DVDs!
1,Broke after 3 years of light use,"No longer turns on after only 3 years of light use. When it does turn on, the disc drive won't open. Don't waste your money."
2,Subtitles don't work and cd skips,"I'm a happy Toshiba HD-TV owner so I figured this would be a great DVD player, especially since consumer reports rates the now obsolete 3960 as a great buy. Initially I was happy with the picture quality, sound etc but the subtitles feature does not work. I've tried with several DVDs and also tried to resize my tv screen to all sizes. If you're wondering why you might care about subtitles, try watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" which has no English soundtrack. Then the next disaster, I played a couple of music CDs and they would skip every 10mins or so. Sorry Toshiba, I'm dissapointed."
1,Broke and didn't even use it that much,"I've had this DVD player for almost a year and half and all of a sudden it just says ""No Disc"" whenever I put something in. Going through the setup menu I tried reseting it even went to Toshiba's website and found that a similar model number: the SD-3980SU2 reaches its life span after a short while and gives the ""bad disk"" error. They should extend that problem to this model number, because its the same problem. Needless to say I'll have to buy a new one for the holidays."
1,Not so sweet,"When longtime member Michie left this trio, she left a gap that was felt very deeply by Shonen Knife - and their fans. Despite a few promising import singles, the real test came with Candy Rock. It's eclectic and unusual, but also sadly lacking in the finger-snapping tunes that fill their other recent CDs. It's as if the band had the breath punched out of them. But there was also a kind if identity crisis that engulfed them. What was Shonen Knife going to be as the millenium dawned?Shonen Knife would recover. This CD, however, has languished without an American distribution deal, or even a translation. SK has always been known for records that paste a smile on your face, but everything is strained here."
1,Just horrible,"I had to force myself to finish it. For once, I was glad a book was short. I want those hours of my life back.The story was OK, the writing never really moved the story along. I never cared about the characters.World War Z and Dying to Live were great examples of zombie horror. This back does not pass muster at all."
1,A valiant attempt...but its just terrible,"I am pretty generous when it comes to my reviews of the various Z-books I've purchased through Amazon. That said, this book fell entirely short.I purchased it from the 'others who have purchased' list on Amazon, hoping for decent Z-book, based on the reviews of the other readers. By the end I was wondering if I read the same book at some of the other reviewers. As with any SciFi, Fantasy (and particularly) Zombie book, suspension of disbelief is just part of the package. With 'Deadlands' you have to suspend not only belief but a frontal lobotomy might also be in order.Story: Could have gone somewhereCharacters: Painfully badVillain(s): Could have gone somewhereSetting: Painfully bad (particularly the 'frozen' glass lake thing...Go read Day by Day Armageddon, the 'Monster' books, Morningstar, or Keene."
1,Not So Good,"Actually none of these songs sound very good: the audio is cheap, the quality is lacking but the box it comes in tricks you into expecting more."
4,Interesting sequel,"While not all sequels are the best, this one has some meat on it. It shows the main character in a whole new light - life after college and where it takes you. Also, it shows the wrong choices we make and how we learn from it. All in all a good show."
5,Excellent Book,The book is not a tech how to book but in all fairness the auther doesn't claim it as one. This book is more of an autobiography and in that category it is a 5. The auther brags about himself at times but anyone who is that successful has a right too. Excellent read well worth the time!
3,A person who has traded with Lewie,"As a fellow CME member and trader I expected a lot more from a man I had heard much about before I stepped in the S&P pit. The book title is misleading, and he does repeat again and again about his father and his troubled youth. However, I had heard many stories about how LBJ took Soros (the man who broke the bank of England) for a ""ride"" the days following the crash of 87'; and his story matched. I had also heard stories, among others, that LBJ took a Concorde home from europe to get back for the 87' aftermath and proceeded to make a killing; his book again confirmed. Moreover, on a personal level, this book legitamized a lot of rumors that had floated around the CME. To sum it up, this book is auto-biographical with occassional insights into what made him such an exceptional trader; this certainly isnt a ""day traders"" manual."
5,In Depth Commentary,Brown's depth of reseach is amazing. His work is presentled well and easily absorbed.
2,Dissapointed,I have searched for months for a good commentary on the Gospel of John and it looks like the search continues. I got it based on the reviews I have seen on the book from readers. I guess its different strokes for different folks. I am more of a greek and indepth detials on new testament words. My type of commentary is the classic on Jude&Peter by Bauckham. I didn't get that type of exegesis from Brown.
3,Not enough detail,This book spends too much time on where you should stay and not enough time is spent on what there is to see and do. Geneva sounds really boring in the book but the reality is very different. The maps of Switzerland don't even have much detail so it can be difficult to tell where things are. Check out the Swiss tourism site for some great information
2,Basically an Ad for Sonic,"First, this book is a bit pricey for ..............Second, the book is supposed to be about DVD production. Instead it is a really basic overview. The Sonic DVDit! product they have screenshots plastered all over the book and include a demo version on their disc isn't a tool that has ever been used for any commercial title (it is a consumer tool). There are only a few screenshots of Sonic Creator, and no mention of Daikin or Spruce authoring systems which do the lion share of professional titles.The 30 pages on DVD Audio was informative and kept the book from being a total waste.A scant 2 pages on how to get your disc replicated was why I bought this book. Needless to say I was disappointed."
5,Great reference book for Lightwave...,Years after buying it I still refer to it. It's well organized and fun to experiment with some of the material in it. well worth adding to your library.
4,If only for Why...,"Annie certainly has a wonderful voice, her genre is not my usual venue, but there is no denying her singing ""Why"" is one of those songs that becomes timeless, it just flows and wraps itself around you as you listen. All it took was one listen while fiddling around on the radio one day and I had to seek that tune out. Beautiful. Kudos Annie. Thanks."
5,Go Annie! She really proved critics wrong!,"Singer Annie Lennox had been best known for her successful partaking in the dynamic duo ""Eurythmics"", one of the finest 'hit makers' of the 80's. With hits like ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Here comes the Rain again"", ""Must be an Angel"" and ""Sisters are doin it for themselves"", there didn't quite seem to be a possibility that either of the two could persue a more successful careeer going solo. However, as the popularity of the duo slightly declined in the late 80's, Annie Lennox began writing a collection of songs, and by 1992, Annie had released her first solo album, 'Diva'. The first single, ""Walking on Broken Glass"", was a unexpectingly huge hit and the catchy pop song hit radio stations everywhere. The entire album is absolutely amazing. Critics were surprised that the star could succeed alone without the rock based titled ""Eurythmic"" labled on her...now that's talent."
2,~eh~,"This book was so-so. Good points: It gives a decent overview of a good company in qualitative terms. Bad points: It is repetitive and fails to deliver in quantitative terms. If you are a real numbers cruncher, this book isn't for you. I think if you really want to get a good understanding of Buffett, you should read Warren Buffett: The making of an American Capitalist. A new investor should not invest strictly by the teachings of this book, while an experienced investor can simply disregard its shortfalls.I do have one gripe about Mary's book in particular, however. In Buffettology, she mentions that a hypothetical company with earnings of $1 million a year in actuallity earns nothing if it has to replace its machinery every other year at a cost of $2 million. Isn't the cost of this machinery already factored into earnings (through depreciation)? According to accounting rules, it is."
3,"Good for the beginner, but fell short of expectations","This is a good book for the beginning investor interested in learning the techniques of finding superior long-term investments. However, it fell short of my expectations. (I do not consider myself a beginning investor.) The book repeats certain concepts over and over again and explains Buffet's methods in a simple, common-sense style. There are probably a half dozen chapters that are worth reading and the rest are repetitive or filler. It also has notable gaps, such as a complete omission of Buffett's fascination with insurance companies.This is worth buying, but I don't think it is the last, definitive look at Buffett's investing style and would recommend any of the Peter Lynch books over this one."
3,"good ideas, poor writing","Ms. Buffett explains many of Warren Buffett's guiding principles. Most of them have been set out elsewhere, particularly in the Berkshire annual reports, but it is nice to have the explanations in one place. Unfortunately, the writing is poor - there are even occasional grammar mistakes! - and the tone is too folksy. And the last section, telling you how to form a group of investors to give you money so you can make your first billion, is really irresponsible. To think that anyone can read this book and therefore somehow equal Warren Buffett's vast business experience, accounting sophistication, and general intelligence, is downright dangerous. Nonetheless there is good material here."
3,Sorry Johnny,"This man deserves every ounce of respect that is given to him. I love the guy. This disc was recorded at a time in his career that he admitted to being creatively stuck. While this disc has it's moments,(Billy Joe Shaver's ""The Cowboy who Started a Fight,"") overall, this one ranks as average. It wasn't till a few years later that he bounced back, but boy, did he ever bounce back! This might be one to pass on, and skip over to his early 90's releases."
5,Loved It!!,This book was inspirational and shed some light on abuse and how to cope. This book is great reading for anyone and everyone. If you or anyone you know has been abused- I highly recommend this book.
3,Roorback,Roorback being Sepultura's 9th studio album and 2003 release and their first release on SPV Records. The album is an improvement if one compares it with Against but not as good as prior releases. The sound is a mix of groove metal and thrash metal light. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with illustrations that are quite nice if a bit busy. Allmusic gave this release a 4/5 which in my opinion is a bit high. 3/5 is more a fair grade. 3/5.
1,too small,This toe ring could have come from a very cheap. It's too small for the price. Looks like fake.Was so disappointed. Go back....unfortunately.
4,Cool Book,"This was a good book. I have read over thirty Thoroughbred books. This is one of the better ones, although the cover is not correct, because you don't saddle a horse on the right side. If they are from Whitebrook then why are they wearing Townsend Acres colours and what is Samantha doing to Pride's bridle?"
2,A very Basic Book for Beginners,"This book seems to teach the very fundamental lines of code toretrieve records from a database. It was a very good bookfor the beginner in databases using c#.Although it teaches you thecommonways of accessing information it does lack the insight how it would fit into a large applicationsThe create view and insight in indexes I figured was a completewaste of time for more experienced programmers as was theSql queries section. I don't seem to see databases used withweb services in the book even though I did not think it was thattough for a beginner to absorb. There were no examples wherethe database code was used in a class or in DCOM calls. All examples were simple standard exe type.For the price of the book, I expected a lot more for my money.By the way chapter 1-10 could have been condensed to 2-3 chapters. It was very long winded and the climax wasn't there.I did like the small section on sql error handling"
4,A canonical text of theoretical CS,"Written with an audience of one class in mind, Professor Kozen writes a book which should be read by a much larger audience-namely, by anyone looking for a solid intoduction to the foundational aspects of theoretical computer science. The order in which the material is presented is perhaps the greatest strength of this text. Kozen starts with a treatment of Finite Automata, then makes a transition into Context Free Grammars, and finally to Turing Machines and a general exploration of computational undecidability. One weakness was that there was little in the way of applications. I think that the greatest understanding of how grammars and TM's work comes from actually using these structures in computer programs. A new edition of the book would benefit greatly from more programming assignments as well as a few chapters discussing areas of where these different machines are actually utilized and how they are so efficient."
1,Trash Book,"This book is ... Who doesn't even know what is Automata forget this stupid book. This book start talking alot of blah... like for example: ""a 'DFA' works like this"" without even give an enough explanation about the concept of a 'DFA'. So only who has an idea of this subject can handle the information in the book at least in the second read :P . Good that I found internet sites to explain me in a better way about Automata. If I could I would give negative stars to this book!"
2,Excessively indulgent,"A few good ideas are stretched out and eventually squandered with secondary avant-garde-isms turning the album from an enveloping, if obscured post-rock experience, to the hollowed experimentations of a third-rate Sleepytime Gorilla Museum."
3,Heroine's attitude ruined the book for me.,"I started out really liking this book, but when I saw how Tessa was acting toward Lucien and the comments she would make, it ruined the book for me. I feel in love with Lucien's character and wanted him to desperately get rid of the nagging ball and chain that he had grown attached too. Not only did she insult him (which I give her created for because of how the begging of the story started) but when she finally started seeing how sweet and gentle he was, she was still a witch.I also grew irritated with her selfish attitude. She started to redeem herself toward the end of the book, but when she called her baby ""ugly"" I threw my hands up in defeat. Overall this was a good story with a nice sci-fi plot. The world building was really great too. If the heroine would have been more likable, I would have definitely given this story a higher rating."
4,Fun Experience for Toddlers,This is a fun experience to read and let a toddler experience a Carousel ride when they identify and then adapt a fun Carousel ride.
3,"Not as wowed as I thought I would be, but still pretty good.","I am really not convinced that the coating on this cookwear is any better that some of the really cheap wal*mart items. While the products are attractive, sit well on my burners, and are durable, the coating seems to be less durable than expected. I am less wowed than I had hoped to be, but I would not discourage anyone from purchasing these since they are still a good product. I still think I like farberware better as the coatings see more durable. With these, afte ronly a few uses, I can see scuff marks from very gently moderate use. I am glad I purchased them but I probabbly will do something different next time. Don't get me wrong, it is a good product, just a bit overpriced maybe."
1,OK set if you have never had a great set,"I have had a set of cookware for over twenty years and was looking to replace, seeing the reviews I decided to go for it. I wasn't impressed, the set doesn't seem as though it's going to last very long...it's not in my house anyway. I am going to sell it in a yard sale this spring for $20 and go with hard anodized...should have done that anyway..."
3,Somewhat enjoyable ending to the series,"Gods help me, but I love Piers Anthony. I'm even willing to put up with his at times over-the-top dialogue. It's a bit like reading a first-draft Kevin Smith screenplay: everything everyone says is just incredibly clever, but seriously.. not everyone is that amazingly erudite.The heart of the story and series? I love. I've loved this concept of his for years, and even though I've had somewhat harsh words for a few of the individual books in the series, I still own them, and still re-read them. The setting, concept, and characters are just wonderful, and on those merits alone, I'd recommend the books."
3,"About 40 minutes too long, but still you will cry","The struggle with dyslexia makes for a good story, and the acting is generally good, but this film really could have been much shorter. Other than the two characters pictured, the rest are cardboard caricatures, and the other teachers shown actually detract from the story because they are so one-dimensional. The kid's anguish is well-demonstrated and acted; its resolution is very Bollywood. If only real life were so simple..."
5,"""Like Stars on Earth"" Shines","Dyslexia is more common than we like to admit, and difficult to diagnose accurately. This film shows how a knowledgeable teacher (who had been there) can make a constructive difference in a child and a whole family. Both Hindi and English soundtracks, but we got the most from the film by viewing with English soundtrack AND English subtitles. ""Must See"" film for teachers and families with members with dyslexia. (We have nieces who were diagnosed in elementary school.)"
1,it sure looks nice in the picture.,Finally got it all together after having to file the grooves on the legs. Put the quilt on it and it cracked and then broke 1 whole leg. I got my money back to say the least.
4,"It's decorative, it's not furniture","This looks nice however do not tighten the screws too tightly or you will risk the wood cracking.There is a small space between my two couches in my living room. In that space are several cords. I didn't like the way it looked so I bought this a decorative piece to hide those cords. It looks great!!!!As a non-functional decorative piece, it's perfect. It's not furniture.I understand the complaints regarding assembly and the quality."
1,Total Junk,"This product is awful quality! Don't waste your time or money on it. It looks nice in the picture, and is a nice price, but you get what you pay for. When assembled, the rods don't line up and the product is super flimsy. You will be dissapointed guaranteed!"
4,Understanding Nanotechnology,Nanotechnology is a broad field to say the least. The most appealing part of this book on the subject is that it draws from several different contributors. This gives the information a very well rounded platform from which to draw. Publishers did an excellent job of making the topic mentally manageable for me.
3,Inno Car Kit,"If you have a tape deck this would have received 5 stars, but using the wireless FM connection the sound quality is not as good as I would like it to be."
5,Outstanding Reference forThose Who Want to Succeed in the US,"A well organized, readable and practical reference and motivational book. Based upon the actual experiences of immigrants who have succeeded in America, it provides a wealth of practical advice and reference information. In fact, one does not have to be an immigrant to find it very useful. it will be valuable to anyone who wants to succeed in America as it includes a wide range of practical advice from job hunting to retirement planning."
4,My Personal Review,"I appreciated all the time the author takes to explain her quilting process. Saw the author on Kaye's Quilting on t.v. first. Enjoy the fact that I have complete freedom to choose fabrics for my own quilt. Also, making separate sections appeals to me. Nice book!! Also I received the book within several days!!"
2,Beware Introduction,I've reviewed this trilogy elsewhereThe Long Day Wanes: A Malayan Trilogy (The Norton Library)so won't repeat that review here. But this edition has what I think is a tendentious and inaccurate introduction by Burgess that the publishers have apparently seen fit to reproduce from a 1972 edition without further comment.
4,tongue,"The fluctuation of being within and without this text, a sensation Maso's great manipulation of language induces, is very entertaining and the strength of this book. Interesting to read, with ingenious linguistic and literary devices - sometimes actual mathematic algorithms represented in diagram - that come from within the mind of the protagonist; disclosing her character is the process of this book. The almost interesting plot comes second to the protagonist's interiority. 'Perversely brilliant' are words that come to mind. I like that."
5,My favorite guitar strap,"The DiMarzio strap lock system here is hands down the best strap lock system available. The Dunlops tend to release if they're bumped, and the Schaller locks can be a bit too bulk for some instruments. The DiMarzio models are extremely comfortable, easy to install, and very easy to use."
1,"Early, Awful","I wish the publishers of Ms. Roberts earliest novels would NOT publish them as new releases. The two stories in this book are just awful. Really awful. They are as bad as some of the junk that other romance genre writers churn out even to this day.I love Nora Roberts books from about 1998 on. And I am very fond of her J.D. Robb murder series. Especially the latest which are hip, sharp and witty which makes them selectively collectible.However, with this offering save your money because Love by Design really sucks."
2,Blink 182,"Even I, a huge Blink 182 fan, would not recommend buying this CD. If you really need to buy this CD to learn about Blink 182, you should be ashamed of yourself! Just go to any Blink 182 Fan Site, and you can find out all of this information. Even though this CD is not that great, Blink 182 still rules!!"
1,Card defective,I have used SanDisk Compact Flash cards for years with good performance and no problems. I ordered two 4 GB cards via Chitek Corp an Amazon Marketplace vendor. One of the two cards delivered was defective. I returned the defective card and asked for a replacement. After weeks Chitek did not ship the replacemnet and could not tell me why. I finally had to use the marketplace guarantee and had my money credited to my credit card almost instantly. I will purchase SanDisk cards in the future but not via third parties of Amazon.
5,Excellent,"This card is definitely fast, allowing my Sony Alpha 300 to burst up to 11 frames before slowing down at all. Seek times, and format times are unreal compared to previous experience.I've experienced no problems with it thus far, and highly recommend it."
5,Excellent for 10+ MP bodies,"On my 30D (8.2 MP body), I use the 2GB Extreme III card and it has just the right amount of space for shooting in RAW. But on my 40D (10.1 MP body), I needed more space. The 4 GB card answered that and for a great price. Great for night long-exposure shooting in cold temps."
4,Fast,"I have used this new CompactFlash for a couple of times only. It is much faster than my previous 256 MB SanDisk CompactFlash bought several years ago. I cannot comment on its quality yet; but my 256 MB one is still working fine, I assume this one should have similar quality because same brand name."
4,Extreme III CF memory card,"I love this item, I already had one, very dependable, had my old one for about 4 years no issues. is also cheaper at this time best of both worlds I recommend this item"
2,fast!,"i was suppose to get this movie feb.6th through feb 28th I got it around mid january.movie stars Chrystale wilson and cameron gipp. im not sure if its suppose to be a comedy. mia (chrystale) meets a ghetto girl and they become room mates. the new girl ""pan cake"" is loud, silly, rude and is the one that is a groupie. mia is a reporter an is in love with Gipp who is a rapper."
2,Tongue Cleaner,..Yeah this isn't really that good. When it was shipped the packaging was open and it also isn't very sharp. It's sort of got the width of a typical spoon and scrapes like a spoon. I'd say find another =/
5,Good scrapper. No complaints.,I've used this scraper for about 4 months. It's is good at scraping my tongue and not so thin that you would cut your fingers. The grips are great. I will buy this again.
5,Coffee Breath,I am a big coffee drinker (about 2-3 cups daily) and I've noticed plaque build-up on my tongue that causes me to have bad breath. This tongue scraper is great at removing all of that so I can feel good about my breath. It is more effective than rinsing with Listerine.
3,Ouch,Received this product in the mail yesterday and I've used it twice now. The first time it seemed to do a good job getting rid of any white stuff on my tongue but that night when I used it a second time I had cut my tongue in a few places. I'm not sure if this was from raised taste buds or because I applied too much pressure. This product seems to do a good job and helps prevent gagging but just make sure you don't apply too much force when using it.
4,DR. tungs tongue cleaner,This item works very well for what it is suppose to do. What its made of seems inexpensive so thats why the price is seemingly low. its value is in what it does and not what its made of. nice product.
3,Usefull overview of the subject matter,"This book provides the reader with a usefull overview of the medieval royal families of Scandinavia, Flanders and Kiev. The biographies of the major rulers are interesting. Although the book contains a bibliography, the author's research on the subject would have been more valuable if he added endnotes or footnotes for each chapter. The genealogical tables would be improved with two changes: 1. the addition of all children (specifically, the female lines that are often ignored in books dealing with lines of sucession); 2. a better effort could have been made to identify the mothers of the various offspring and their ancestry. Overall, this is a decent buy for the money."
4,Good game if you love horses.,"People rate this a three star but why? All of the stores are out of stock of them and there are hardly any if any used games in the stores! It's a better game than we thought. I mean, the people who rate games probably like action games or something but alot of these games have been bought and NOT returned like some other games. It must mean it's better than we thought."
4,PLEASE HELP,"okayso i got this game a few months ago, and in three days i had every level but the secret one beatit was super easybut i cant find my way through that maze!!does it just end there?? or is there a way to officially win the game?please repost if you know!!!"
1,Poor Battery Life,"The Coleman PML9000 Spotlight's manual says that the battery needs to be charged every 4 to 6 months. I charged mine for about 22 hours after I purchased it just as the manual recommended. I checked it for operation for a few seconds and got a good bright light. When I needed the spotlight about a month later, there was no light, so I recharged the battery again for about 22 hours. About 2 weeks later the spotlight did not light up. I removed the battery from the spotlight to check its self-discharge characteristics and find that it self discharges to below 5 volts after about 6 days. This is not satisfactory for an ""emergency"" use spotlight."
5,Stott on the Bible and the Christian Life.,John Stott may be the best lecturer I have ever listened to. In these lectures he is at his best. You will definitely have a better understanding of what Christianity is all about after hearing these lectures.
2,Disappointed,"I used another model for about a year, exactly same body, but cordless.It was good to me while it lasted. My only complaint is that it started to leak where the window meets the plastic body. When I noticed the leak, I examined the body more carefully, and I noticed some parts of the platic body were worn out. Didn't they test out the material before they put it into production? Apparently, it cannot withstand the constant exposure to heat.Next time, I am going with stainless steel instead of plastic."
2,Sunbeam Kettle,I gave this product as a gift and am highly dissatisfied with it. It does not detach from a base but must have its cord attached when it is taken to be poured. I would not purchase it again.
2,"Tablecloth nice, AMAZON product description MISLEADING","Amazon'S product discription ""Dine elegantly with Lenox's Opal Innocence table linens. This white tablecloth features an elegant scroll damask pattern and includes an attached decorative corded edge. The cloth measures 60 by 140 inches and comes in a choice of colors and several sizes to accommodate many tables. Sewn from 58 percent cotton and 42 percent polyester, the tablecloth is machine washable and dryable, and may need a warm iron touch up for care. The coordinating collection includes runners, placemats, and napkins for full accessorizing.""I thought the for over $50 I was getting the tablecloth with runners, placemats & napkins as indicated above.Turns it it is JUST the tablecloth, which is overpriced, but works well enough. I also ordered white, but the color is off-white/cream"
2,The Artist's Way and its guiding influence,Several years ago I read the Artist's Way and it changed my life. For years after that I searched for of the same but nothing was available until I came across The Artist's Way at Work. This book of course follows the same guidelines as the first book but I feel is more suited to those who work in large offices and organizations. I was a little disappointed as it did not really apply to my situation although I found some parts helpful in dealing with some of the people around me. Certainly for those people who work in a large company and have not read The Artist's Way this would be a good book to start you thinking in different directions.
2,Too expensive!,"The is a packet of 5 x 8 index cards. I thought I was going to get 250 for $5.06. Instead there's a measly 25 very thin pieces of paper that can barely be considered ""cards."""
1,Dissapointed,"I got it for the Crepitation contest, but afterwards before you can turn it off is starts in with the ""F"" word and ruins the whole thing."
2,Slow and unreliable phone,"I had my Motorola RAZR for 9 months, and I'm glad to be rid of it. There was slight delay between when I pressed a button and when the screen would pop up which was irritating and made simple tasks confusing. Several times it froze up for a minute after I ended a call. I talk on the phone probably 30 minutes everyday and rarely text, but still the battery life was poor. I had to charge it everyday. I also found the keypad awkward and difficult to use.On the positive side, however, it sleek and has a very bright, attractive screen.I don't recommend the RAZR to anyone looking for a reliable phone."
3,"Weak Battery Life, but good value","I got this free with a 2 year service plan w/Verizon.The battery life could be much better (sacrificed by small profile?), and Verizon doesn't allow a lot of the basic ring tones and sound bites from other websites (free stuff), like my wife's ""Chocolate"" phone.It's a very attractive phone and easy to use, but since it was free, I like it. If I were to buy this phone outright...I would have been mad.It has still camera and Video mode alone with an easy to use/setup Bluetooth option (I have the Motorola MOTO H12 headset)I'm looking to replace this phone when the time is right. 3 stars is a fair rating."
1,does not hold a charge ... cuts out after speaking only for a few seconds.,I am very disappointed with this purchase. It cuts out after only a couple of seconds and will not hold a charge. It does say no warranty so I am completely out of luck I guess I should have realized that no warranty means...don't expect it to work.
1,Can someone please contact me????,I have yet to receive this merchandise and their is no contact info. Please help me AMAZON!
3,Motorola V3r,"I purchased the product because of its features and yes its great, but it had some issues and Amazon could guarrantee me the same exact one i had when they replace it. this is got me very angry and am not to this very day satisfied. I wanted to buy a big screen LCD TV from here but i put it off due to this issue. and I do not think i will buy another electronic form here again. i will stick with books and maybe CD's."
4,My opinion on Motorola RAZR V3 Black Phone,"The item has been shiped fast, transaction smooth and nice, satisfied with the item. The only thing is that I don't like the disign of the phone and the usage of it, I like silver one over the black."
2,GARBAGE,"NICE LOOKING PHONE, NICE LIGHT WEIGHT, BUT OVERALL THE PHONE IS GARBAGE...I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE RAVE WAS ABOUT."
1,JUNK,Do not buy a phone like this does not work. The phone worked less than thirty days display went dark. JUNK
2,Good looks empty head,"The battery is almost insignificant, going from full charge to empty in 90 minutes of use. Good looking phone, but in my area will not go onto the internet although Cingular never disclosed that and continues to charge for the non-service. I'm changing phones and providers."
1,motorola razor unlocked,"I bought this for my mothers birthday and as my mother says ""it feels like a toy phone"". It is cheaply made, flimsy and everytime I talk to her im just hoping that I will understand what she is saying. The phone has lots of static and calls get dropped constantly. I WOULD NOT TELL ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE"
1,Dont believe what you see in the pictures,"Because all those eccessories are not included and it is not an international, an international would come with the 110v & 220v charging systems this one only came with a 110v."
4,"Great product ... but sent with an ""invalid battery""","I received the V3 but it was shipped with a non-original battery. It says ""Invalid battery"" and wouldn't be recognized by the phone. I have to buy a new one."
1,poor,"I will never buy another refurb phone. I was not happy at all.When I purchased this phone, I expected it to be fully functional,IT WAS NOT. I could not access the Internet or recieve text messaging with pictures. The only thing it did, was make and receive calls. Was not worth the money."
2,Motorola RAZR V3 Black,"I ordered and paid for a Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked International Version (Black).The cell phone was supposed to be ""New"" but the cell phone is clearly""Refurbished"". This is obvious from the wear marks on the backside, wear marks withscratches & dent on the dial keypad and wear marks in the battery compartment. Alsofound the date of manufacture is 6/2006. Need to be careful. This is my last purchaseof anything here."
1,Horrible Quality Control,"Great phone functionality wise, but horrible hardware quality. My third replacement phone just stopped working- one week after the one year (cingular) warranty expired.All three failures were the same problem- the keypad stops functioning except for the end/power button.I guess it is just a form-before-function problem, as my Nextel Motorola i730 (work phone) doesn't skip a beat after 3 years of drops, tosses, kicks, etc...I'm bitter and I have no other recourse than to post a bad review since Cingular and Motorola now say it's my problem. I'm sure it will hurt them dearly... LOL"
1,Don't drop it!!!!,If you are even slightly rough on cell phones than this is NOT the phone for you! I dropped mine less than two feet (about knee high) and now everytime I flip it shut it turns off and the screen goes blank (white) everytime I try to turn it back on. There are alot of people (at least 4) that I know that have the same exact problem with this phone!!!
1,Motorola V3,"I am so disappointed with this phone. From day one, I started experiencing dropped calls after about 20 seconds, and after about two weeks of use, my LCD died. I replaced the LCD and had the phone flashed, and flexed and nothing helped. It's currently packed away in the box, and I'm hoping to have it stripped down and the individual parts sold. If you're thinking about purchasing one, try your luck with one of the other models if you insist. Mine was likely refurbished according to the technician who worked on it, and there are probably alot more like it on the net. So, buyer beware."
2,Dont waste your money.,"The razor phone is a great phone, if you buy it from the store.(my first one got wet after having it for two years, with no problems.) I was trying to save money, and ordered it from here. It was a mistake. The first phone I was sent came in a brand new box, everything sealed, and it didnt even work. I returned it hassle free, the woman e-mailed me, was so polite, replaced my phone. I figured things happen. Im getting a new one, no big deal. Anyway, long story short, It stopped working after a month. Just STOPPED working. The screen went blank, I replaced the battery, nothing would work. If you buy the phone on here, your taking a 50/50 chance. I ended up having to go back to the store and buy a new phone, which if I wasnt trying to be cheap in the first place, I wouldnt have ended up wasting a hundred on garbage. So good luck to you. If you buy it, I hope your phone works better than mine did."
1,Razor V3,I loved this phone but the warranty is poor. I wear my phone constantly on a belt holder and apparently the phone got some moisture on it. I am not talking about getting wet but moisture from day to day activities. Apparently this phone has a indicator in it that turns redish/pink when exposed to moisture and the warranty is void.I ended up having to buy a brand new phone because Motorola would not replace.Needless to say I did not but a RAZR. I treated the phone the same as I do all my phones and have never had one quit due to this before or after the RAZR. In my opinion this is poor design/poor support and I will not spend the money for this phone again even though I love the functionality and setup of this unit.
1,This phone is a joke.,I ordered this phone for my son who will be going back to college soon. The first phone was received promptly. It did not work--wouldn't even turn on--battery would not charge. So I sent it back for a replacement. Second one arrived. Worked fine for 24 hours; then the outside screen went blank. I am sending this phone back and canceling my order. I will never buy Motorola again. Totally frustrating and unsatisfactory. I hope I will not get crappy service when I request a refund.
3,Not what the picture showed,"There were pictures of more accessories then were provided. The company was reasonable to work with for a return but did take a restocking fee for an item that was not opened. I received the item second hand as the protective coverings had paper stuck to it, appearing that it had been removed and re-applied. Overall not an aweful interaction, but I was hoping for more."
2,now what,"started getting use to the motorola v3 and found it fairly friendly to use. ring and vibration wasa bit too low and soft for my taste.then after two weeks of use, the ringtones stopped working.. all i would get is vibes. i missed many calls and all the people i turned towant lots of money to restore the ring.i am outside the u,s,a , so cannot even think bout returning it."
1,Missing parts and no directions for assembly,"I am trying to return this piece of garbage as quickly as I can. The directions for assembly make absolutely no sense and it didn't come with the red dot device that it shows on the box. Even without the red dot, I have no idea how to assemble this thing and I have been trying for days. I want my money back as soon as possible. Do not buy this."
2,Meh,"I was so excited to get this crossbow. i am by no means a crossbow expert, but i do know that a 90lb pull back is pretty powerful. i thought it'd be a fun toy to play with for a while. i was mistaken :(. it shot well for the first two shots and then one of the cables BROKE. Potentially dangerous, and i would not recommend wasting your hard earned money upon this. Pretty much, you get what you paid for. A 50$ China made piece of poop :/"
1,Bad crossbow,I bought this crossbow in downtown L.A for like 20 bucks on amazon its 30 so I bought it its really bad no instructions but got it together from a good friend that knows about crossbows turns out in about the fifth shot the lever handel to cock the crossbow broke so if you want to waste thirty bucks on a toy go ahead
4,Good for the price !,Its is a good crossbow to start with. Good price for the product. I try it woth my son. Works good.
1,DONT GET IT,I bought it and after the 3rd shot it broke and i tryed to return it and the guys aren't answering me
3,Adequate tool,"While not up to hunting quality, this is an adequate tool. I purchased it for stringing wires through tight ceiling areas and after some slight modification is able to do the job. A serious toy!"
1,Item broke after once use.,"The bow part broke after the item was cocked once. Along with the bow breaking,. the dart's tip were not attached well and fell off."
2,100 lbs. draw is bull,I purchased this crossbow as a gift for my girlfriend because I bought a 80 lbs. cobra crossbow for myself and loved it. I saw that this model was a mini compound so I knew she could draw it easier than mine so I got it. We test fired it against a laminated particle board. It wouldn't even stick an alluminium bolt into it. My 80 lbs. bow would bury any bolt fired at it 1/2 inch deep. All in all it is a fun toy but the 100lbs draw is a farce. I did take the red dot sight from it and put it on my cobra crossbow and nail bullseyes all day long.
5,Bratz Sun Kissed Summer Cloe,"Cloe, one of the Sun Kissed Summer Bratz, has long blond hair and green eyes. She wears a blueish greenish color swimsuit and bare feet. She also comes with two more outfits, a blue surf board, a drink, and some more accessories, but I don't know whst they are because I don't have her. You can also collect all of Cloe's friends in this series: Yasmin, Sasha, Jade, and Dana, and the Boyz: Cameron, Dylan, Koby, Eitan, and Cade, and have a pool party at the Splash N Dance pool with Fianna. I didn't buy this doll when I liked Bratz because twenty dollars for just a doll is too much money! My Scene dolls with swimsuits are less than this, and they come with movies!"
5,Lovely tanned Cloe,"In my opinion, Cloe happens to be the best in the sun kiss line of bratz only cause she shows off her tan so nicely. Her tan brings out her blonde hair (which has three small braids running down her hair and highlights) green eyes and make up. She comes with a towel, surfboard, and a beautiful looking white blouse to bring out that wonderful tan. She also has other accessories as you can see on amazon. Yasmin happens to be my favorite in the bratz line but she is already tanned..so there wasn't much to tell on her tan."
3,a little outdated but....,still a good reference tool. This book is a little outdated but I should have read the listing better. Not the sellers fault at all. The book was shipped very quickly and was in decent condition. Will probably look for a more current reference guide but this will hold me for now! Thank you!
1,Simply not sturdy enough,"Had high hopes for this syringe injector, but was sadly disappointed. This is the second I've purchased, and both quickly broke when trying to inject marinades into rib roasts.Unless whatever you're injecting is pure liquid, this product will jam, and the pressure needed to force the fluid into the meat eventually cracks the plastic syringe housing, rendering it useless.Even small bits about the size of a bit of pepper will clog this needle.I found it very unsatisfactory and am now resigned to paying extra for an all metal model of meat injector, and wish I had done so from the beginning.Unless you only want to inject pure liguids, shy away from plastic syringes, or find one with larger holes in the needle."
3,Good book for beginners...,This is a good book for beginning runners. Some of the content seems a little outdated. I'll probably be giving this book away to someone who wants to begin a running program. Really not a good buy for intermediate or advanced runners.
4,Galloway loves running,"I appreciated his infectious love for running, and the way he speaks to runners of all different skill levels."
5,I love this philosophy of running.,I tried the run/walk and it works. Hopefully this will enable me to continue my triathlon career.
1,Disappointing...,I was very disappointed with this book. The information was outdated and the section on women's running was inaccurate.
5,Great Product,"My 2-1/2 year-old granddaughter loves this book. She points to it on the shelf where I keep it and tells me, ""Ready for school, Gamma."" This means she wants me to get it down and help her work on a few pages. I'm always ready to quit before she is...she'd like to spend much more time learning."
3,not too bad,"This movie was average in my opinion. It is a bit of a comedy/drama, and I would have preferred it stayed as a comedy since I enjoyed Amitabh in some of the comedic scenes - because by the end it was very sad and it definately made me cry. The acting was ok, I also found I didn't 'connect' to the characters or the story that much. The songs were not great in my opinion, except the holi song but even that one wasn't consistent. So, it was an ok movie worth watching once but not one I would watch again."
1,don't be fooled,"This is a great item unfortunately the item description states a pair and in reality you only get one. So while you get suckered in to buying and waiting for the second dumbbell, have fun getting a good work out in with one dumbbell."
4,Great deal,"I was just a bit wary when I was deciding whether to purchase the SmartFit Hornets Nest 40lb Dumbbells. However as soon as I got them out of the box I knew that I had made the right choice. I had worked out for ten years straight before stopping five years ago. This product has proven to offer just the right range of weights for a complete exercise regimen. And it is easy to use, with a comfortable grip. I fully recommend this item.IMPORTANT - Please note that you do have to by two of these items, and the stand is a ""must have""."
5,Fantastic Book!,"Dr. Sagan's book is very very thorough in its coverage of this subject, and it is easy to read, easy to understand. The first exercise that I did from this book yielded psychic phenomena immediately. I had never had this experience before. Finally a book that produces what it says it will! My experience with this book caused me to want more, and eventually I signed up for Dr. Sagan's complete correspondence course. It was wonderful! And I was so sorry when it ended. If you take the course, though, you will find that you are pretty much on your own with it. My experience was that questions get answered very very slowly if ever. However, it was still worth it. I have all of Dr. Sagan's books and have found them invaluable for my spiritual growth."
3,Needle End is Dull,"Had to do some modifications to the needle on this unit. Would not pierce port or beef. Took a grinder to the tip and now it is acceptable. Does not leak, little cumbersome to clean. I'd probably try one of the cheaper plastic versions next time around for comparison."
1,"witless, humourless, hopeless","The early ""Mole"" books had some element of originality and wit concerning the perception of Middle Class, Middle England, suburban life. There were even moments of real originality. BUT, in this latest offering, any sign of those edifying features has gone, gone completely. What is left is an extremely lazy listing of trite, unfunny references to Blairous Britain and a dreary descrition of the life of a 30 year old with every cliche-ridden comment on life that any Political Commentator would be ashamed of. Just read Boris Johnson, for example, to get an idea of nos jours as seen with someone with at least some style. A complete waste of money"
5,Next Generation Cooking at Last!,"Mrs. Cooksey seems to be destined to help define the 21st century cook. This book has an unpretentious feel that gets you right into the nuts and bolts of the recipes in no time flat! I can't wait to see this rumored Dinner and Dessert with Victoria! If this lady can teach me to look good in the kitchen, then imagine what veteran cooks could do with this. I love how she encourages the reader to change any aspect of the recipe to suit individual tastes. I needed to see that there is a pro out there that still gets creative and thinks freely. Thanks!"
5,Best Cookbook out there.,"This book has thrown off the shackles of the Ina Garten and Martha Stewart dominated world of cooking and entertaining and provided a professional yet easy to approach method of great food, brilliant entertaining tips and realistic shopping lists of affordable ingredients. No more must we watch Martha or Ina make macaroni and cheese using eighty-five dollars and seven hours of money and effort. Thank you Victoria!!"
4,Improve your golf game!,"Having received the CD of ""Golf is not a game of perfect"" I now have a pre game routine of listing to the CD before a round of golf....it really helpsto keep me focused during a round and improve my tempo while playing...."
5,"Play Smart, Score Better and Have Some Fun for a Change!","Bob Rotella's book opens the door for the uninitiated on what you should and should not be thinking about while playing a round. He has some marvelous tips about what kinds of attitudes you have to have to get past the bad shot we all hit without letting it color (and wreck!) the rest of the round. He will also help you structure your practice time, so that it will have a positive impact on your scoring. Start to finish this quick read will have you itching to implement his suggestions. This is a ""must read"" for anybody who has aspirations of being a better golfer. I bought four copies for my golfing relatives. What else can I say? Buy this book."
3,Stuck in the middle again,"I have to say that I didn't have the greatest expectations of this film. After watching it, turns out it's better than I thought. Not saying it's a great movie but it's not bad either. Somewhere in the middle. It's inspired by a true story and it reminds me of Bully but without the unnecessary, overexposed nudity. I actually favored their decision to mark every witness that saw the hostage with the captors. Especially the bystanders who have no connection to any of them whatsoever. The acting was pretty good but the entertainment value could've been better."
3,"Ben Foster, one of my favs. His perforamance here is whats","required to get political change in USA, especially raise taxes on the Rich ..The Way the charater ben plays tries to keep his job...thats what it will take for serious political change....Crazy macho aggresion.."
1,Alpha Dog is a real dog,I did not like this movie at all. The characters were sad examples of low life punks. NOT WORTH WATCHING !!!! Just my opinion.
4,Excellet First Book,"Romance and mystery. Dorothy Phaire makes these two genre work together well. The title was so befitting for the book.Both of the female characters found themselves in relationships where the love was almost non existent. While I thought it took to long to get to the mystery, and it had a number of suspects and twists that made this book an exciting page turner."
4,Entertaining.,"I liked Renee, admired her courage. She wasn't happy and floundered a bit as we all do in her search for meaning and hence purposed in her life. She was my favorite character. I thought Veda's issues were definitely real...having to hit rock bottom to see that LaMarr was not worth the time of day. I also liked the fact that she had a true sister/friend who had her back and vice versa."
4,A page turner!,"I finally read this title and am happy that I did...About one-third of the way through, the intrigue captured me and I had to read the book until the very end! Ms. Phaire really gets into the psyche of each of the characters and the ending was a total surprise with a twist!"
4,Reading my own history,"I grew up during the times reviewed in this book. It rankles somewhat to find how little I knew of my own ""history"". If you are a ""end-of-the-curve-baby-boomer,"" I recommend this book to you without reservation."
1,great until it stops working,"I had this and a phillips TV. Both broke, both times Phillips did crap. I'm never buying from this company again and I could not recommend you buy from them either."
1,not please,"This product had flaws such as battery would not hold a charge. It was slow to download music. The player had internal problems as well. When I tried to return the player, amazon said I must contact the owner for instructions. They did not have any. You got me this time."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","I apologize for being vague but if you want to know the story, other reviewers will fill you in. Too good to be a bad movie by a long shot. Sadly, it lacks in elements that would make it a good one. Never the less, it is a decent horror picture if you ignore certain inconguities and cliched attempts to frighten. For the most part the acting is solid and some very well done visuals but then again, ""some"" is the operative word here. A wonderful idea that could have been more fully realized."
4,Dear Lucy,"Dear Lucy,I have just finished reading your book 'Yoga School Dropout' and I luuuved it sooo much.When I cam to pages 250 or so, I was reluctent to read fast. I wanted this book not to end.Not a single boring or uneventful page in your story-book. I kept underlining with a pencil for later reference.I am a Sports Therapist and dedicated yogini for over 20 years, and an exited and enthusiastic teacher for 10 years.You have written down my yogis life feelings - while reading your book I kept nodding all the way.I have learned from many teachers and many styles...but travelled to India/Pune only, to meet the living legend Mr. BKS Iyengar, my biggest influence on teaching a 'yoga for all people'.Thank you Lucy, and I truly hope you keep writing books.I for sure, will read them.Namaste, Monika"
1,Animated Halloween Candy Bowl,"A disappointment. This candy bowl works by using a motion sensor. When motion is detected, the product responds by moving the hand downward and playing one of three pre-recorded messages. The messages are ""Happy Halloween"", ""Want some candy?"" and ""Trick or Treat."" The motion sensor did not work very well. It often failed to detect motion. On occasion, it would activate when there was no motion."
4,"Not as good as the 1st, but still entertaining","I think there is no need to rehash the synopsis of ""Two for the Dough."" All you need to know is that it is about military ammo, caskets, and severed body parts, all delivered with a unique burg flare.I liked this book slightly less than ""One for the Money"" and if I could, I'd rather give it 3.5 stars instead of 4. Everything about it - Grandma Mazur's antics, Morelli's smoldering hotness, Stephanie's happy-go-lucky attitude - were simply no longer fresh. The story was still entertaining and engaging in every possible way, but I just didn't find it as funny as its predecessor. It took Evanovich more than 150 pages to squeeze some chuckles out of me and I was seriously wary of Grandma's lines by the end of the book.However, I still enjoyed ""Two for the Dough"" quite a bit and will continue on with the series, but it is obvious to me that I can only take both Stephanie and the burg in small doses, with long breaks between the books."
3,Fun characters enliven middling mystery,"Stephanie Plum's second case involves missing coffins and stolen military weapons. Author Janet Evanovich writes a light, breezy novel with many endearing characters, but as a mystery, it doesn't satisfy. Whenever Stephanie needs a piece of information, it is offered up by one of her many well-placed friends, be it Mancuso the cop, Ranger the tough bounty hunter, a friend at the DMV--you get the idea. She doesn't seem to discover much on her own. However, since Evanovich's plot is really just a showcase for her characters, it is still an enjoyable and quick read."
4,Two for the Dough,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed ""One for the Money"", but it was still very entertaining. I found ""Two for the Dough"" to be a little more predictable than ""One for the Money""; then again, maybe that's just because I read ""One for the Money"" and kind of knew how things play out in this series in these books. I will definitely be reading ""Three to get Deadly"" eventually."
3,Miss Kay NC,Would read it again but really want to start the next one. Love her books. She e gets b better with each one
4,Just not the same...,"While this book, for another author, might be good, for Evanovich it is 1 star. It was very funny in places, but the sentamentality got a little sticky. I am a big fan of Grandma Mauzer, but I think that she slowed the book down a little. When she said ""He made me feel like an old woman"" (or something of the sort) she lost her devil-may-care attitude and became a weak old lady, not the Grandma Mauzer who we all know and love. Still good, but just not the same as the others."
4,Gotta read them all!,"I got started with the Stephanie Plum novels and now have read, or ordered all 18. They are funny, have a little romance thrown in, and each apprehension is a hoot or a mystery. Keeps me laughing out loud the whole time I'm reading. Would love to see the movie ""one for the money."" I bet that Sherry Shepard is perfect as Lula."
5,Laugh out loud funny (and a good mystery too!),"I listened to this as a book on tape read by Lori Petty (the loudmouthed younger sister ball player on ""A League of Their Own""). This book was a wonderful diversion, and quite possibly may have been the high point of a rough week punctuated by car troubles and work pressures. I could not wait to get back in the car and hear about Stephanie and her Grandma Mazur! In fact, when I had to switch vehicles due to aforementioned car trouble, the first thing I moved over was this tape (and I forgot my lunch!).I can't wait to listen to the next one!"
4,Two For The Dough,Two For The Dough is a light entertaining read. It has just the right amount of mystery and humor mix.
3,Simple but Fun Read.,"Janet Evanovich has created and delightful series which is both easy and enjoyable to read. Some reviewers are correct that it's not a highly developed, complex novel. But who says it has to be? When I am looking for something fun and easy to read, I turn to the Stephanie Plum Series. This book is a very quick read. Stephanie Plum is a great character and her mix ups with her fellow bounty hunter Ranger and he childhood nemesis Morelli are fun to read about without being overly romantic or too mushy for me to read. The action moves quickly and is not so deep that I need to be Sherlock Holmes or a CSI cast member to figure it out. When I am looking for a challenging read, I don't look at Stephanie Plum, but when I want quick, fun and refreshing she's the bounty hunter for me!"
5,Another Winner,"Loved the first one a lot. In fact I laughed out loud several times, something that a book can rarely invoke. The story is an easy read but the circumstances, the family, Grandma and Joe all combine for a real pleasure. I will say this with every book review by this author: Why hasn't Hollywood pick up on this new heroine? You have to wonder why some of the film selecters are still being paid seven figures to bring us forgettable films that lose money on a regular basis."
2,"artificially ""balanced"" history","The author starts off with a fine graphic and factual account of the battle of Lepanto in 1571. However, what follows is a series of the author's conclusions designed more to present a ""balanced"" picture of Islam than real history. I would rather have seen the facts for myself and drawn my own conclusions. I read history for the history, not to have my thoughts politically corrected. If you have any doubts as to the above criticism, just read the introduction where the author manages to criticize the West for it's treatment of women. This in a book on Islam!"
5,Significant learning through whole brain applications,"Clear, easy to read and understand. This book is not only practical, it can also change lives of those who take the lessons seriously. Applications from this book have made me effective in teaching a graduate school elective called Integrative Systems for Intuitive Natural and Creative Technologies (In.St.I.N.C.T.). The subject is very well recieved and is offered in three of the top business schools in the Philippines. Thanks to people like Buzan, we can become more confident, creative and meaningful in our lives & work. An excellent all occasion gift..."
3,Not the easiest thing to do,"I consider myself someone who is rather adept at fixing things. I'm not daunted by opening up a piece of electronics. But replacing this battery was fairly difficult to do.I bought the Sonnett battery because it came with a CD-ROM that has an instructional video. That video is excellent.My bigest problem was geting the case open. After a while, the plactic tool that they give you to open the case became useless. With all of the prying I was doing with it, the tip disintergrated.I wound up using another piece of plastic I had in the house (after bending the metal case in 2 places with a knife).I would not fault Sonnett completely. I can only imagine that any kit would be tough to use because the iPod case is so hard to open.Jim"
3,Not his father's book...,"If you liked ""Young Men and Fire"" as I did, you may be very disappointed with ""Fire on the Mountain"". Where Norman Maclean's book was reflective and literary, ""Fire on the Mountain"" is strictly reportage. It was hard to keep track of the cast of characters who were more names & titles than really developed as people. I certainly knew all of the facts about the South Canyon Fire but it didn't create any emotional connection. Someday I'll make a pilgrimage to Mann Gulch, but this book left me cold."
3,Great 1/2 of a book,"OK, so John McLean can't write as well as his father. Making the comparison is kinda' unfair. However, that's no excuse for the ponderous, lethargic writing in the first 7 chapters. This book sucks up until page 105, when it all of a sudden takes off into some brilliant story telling about the blow up and the investigation. My guess is that most people who gave it four or five stars did so for the material in the last half of the book. I wouldn't buy this book, but it definitely is worth a trip to the library to check out"
1,A disservice to the memory of his father and firefighters,"Norman Maclean, himself a former firefighter and woodsman, wrote an excellent account of the Mann Gulch fire. His work was tempered by the distance of time, benefit of age, and experience in the woods. This is obvious through his interaction with the survivors and his search for what happened on that hill.In contrast, John Maclean's account of the South Canyon fire is riddled with accusations, contradicitions of his own statements and interpretations, and a generally muckraking tone. There is searching for truth and then there is searching for animus. I wish he had left this story to those with a little more time in boots than in Chicago.Punctuation seemed OK - 1 star is generous."
1,Don't Buy It,"We have also had this spotlight. It took us three to finally wise up. They are bad & like the others said it's a bad switch. You do not get more than a very few minutes out of the lights before they quit. But you can get into the handle to work on them. There is a little retangular box in the handle & we had a guy look at it & he said there was like a burned area, kind of melted so he scraped it clean & the light began to work. We paid $15.00 for this & it quit again within a few minutes. My husband thinks there is too much wattage or whatever for the type switch. We are trying to fix it ourselves. does anyone know what that black rectangular box is called?"
4,Spot light,Good product and reliable. I recommend it for home and out door use. Casts a bright light for a good distance
1,Warning - Bad Switch,"Ok so on the good note, this is a real good bright lantern with battery lasting about 30 min before needing charge. You will be able to tell cause the light will start dimming towards the end.On the bad note. The switch burned out after using this lamp 3 seperate times. I took the handle apart and using a bent paper clip, I bypassed the switch and voila, the light comes on fine. I suspect the made in China switch is not up to par with the specs and just burned out the contacts. Brinkmann needs an RMA number to send it back but their customer service is automated where if no one is available, you input your tel number and they will call back in the order the call was received. Whats even worse is that you have no way to leave your name so when they call back, they will just get the switchboard here at my work and then they have no idea who the call goes to.. well I'm going to have to call at different times to try to get a real person."
2,OK for Children,"This book might serve the need of elementary school children, but anyone with an introduction to physics will find the book to be of little use. There are hundreds of short (one paragraph) responses to all sorts of questions, some of them not much related to physics. At times the author wants to predict the future: What does the future hold for fusion? At times the author answers a question other than the one asked: Why do monkeys have tails? (The response is on the physical function of tails.)Also there is little order to the text other than broad chapter headings. So if you have a question, the book provides little help in finding the answer.Overall, a weak piece of bathroom reading."
5,Too bad it's the last season,"The only thing wrong with the last season of Everybody Loves Raymond is that it is the last season. The season ended with a series of best episode repeats and then one finale episode, so the last season is only 16 episodes. The producers and writers were afraid that if they continued, the material would stop being fresh, so they ended the series while still ahead.The season beings with Frank and Marie moving to a retirement community some distance away which at first sounds like the story pattern would change, but an extremely funny twist just made the last season better as Robert and Amy find themselves living under the same roof with Frank and Marie.The nine year run was enjoyable and unfortunately, a bit too realistic for anyone who is part of a family. I bought the entire series for my wife and we will enjoy it often. Too bad there isn't a season 10."
2,Raw deal,"So if I understand correctly from the reviews on this page, MoD products cost about twice as much as a standard DVD, aren't always available, suffer from quality issues, may arrive with some discs missing and may not last as long as a regular DVD. Sounds like a great deal for consumers. My seven year old loved season one and has been asking me when season two will be available. I'm not sure what to tell her; I can't say I'm too excited about plunging into the world of manufacture on demand. Would it have really been that difficult for MGM to issue a reasonably priced standard season two? They certainly got season one right. I can't believe that there isn't an audience out there for this show."
5,absolutely perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This storage shed was set up in less than five minutes. It arrived promptly and at a great price. I love it...
2,"Weak, very weak.","This is terrible writing, at its best, marketed to the masses. The dialogue is so unreal. The characters, you can't even relate to them. It's so hokey, and nothing original. Unrealistic practices, rose meditation, c'mon, I'm to do this for two weeks. There are many, many other better books out there. Trying Being Peace by TNH.Good luck, and if this book worked for you, great. I reviewed this in a positive mood too........."
4,"With due respect, better than Eckhart","With due respect to Eckhart Tolle and the inimitable Oprah, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is every bit as awakened and a lot more fun to read than A New Earth which is getting such ""press."" In The Monk Who Sold, the teller of the story, the main character and the reader embark on the same journey at the same time and so the story has an immediacy akin to a spiritual event. Not at all pedantic and yet thought-provoking, the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari teaches non-demominational wisdom that's accessible and timely."
4,A timeless classic,This book is about more than living your dreams - its about living your life in the best possible way. Its an easy read with heaps of wisdom. A great book for those starting out on personal journeys.
3,"Not a literary feat, but a good introduction to self-awareness training","Although there are many many better books on this subject, and many are quoted in this one, I think Robin Sharma has done a good job creating a sort of ""cliffs notes"" to what it takes to begin to become self-aware and self-directed. If you have never been introduced to these topics before, this is a simple (if cheesy) and easy to read introduction.This book is not meant for anyone who has already delved deep into the subject of self mastery - you will find it simplistic and clichéd."
5,Chicken Soup for the heart!,"This book was a fantastic read. From the first minute I picked it up, I didn't want to put it down!This book was so motivating and inspiring! The Author was able to break down the complexity of life, and help to simplify things. The teachings in this book are very extreme, giving up everything and moving away to the high mountains, all to find a better life... However, it gives you the motivation to change some aspects of your life, and recognise what is cluttering up your life. When reading this book, embrace everything that is told, get lost in Journey, and only then think about the changes you can make in your life while you are reflecting this fantastic fable.There is a moment in peoples life when they are ready to make a big change, this book is the stepping stone for those people! I'm 20 years old and this book gave me the motivation to Give up smoking and join the gym! :-)If you do happen to read it, PLEASE let me know what you think!"
2,10 ways to improve your life....story from a mountain,"I just finished this book and was somewhat perplexed by the hype. I'll admit i liked the title, read the jacket and bought it prior to visiting Amazon and researching reviews. I know that i need to exercise daily, eat healthy, balance my life..personal and professional etc.His lessons are not lessons...they are basic common sense ideas to living healthier and longer. Some of the analogies (the sumo wrestler, the pink chord which i have no idea why it is pink) were just bizarre.It took 3 hours to read and then i ate a salad since i am supposed ""to eat foods from the ground"". Whatever."
4,"Read it, if you have any goals in life !",This book is simply brilliant. A must read for all people who have some dreams & goals to follow. Don't miss it!
3,Saint Surfer & CEO much better - but this is okay,"I enjoyed this book, but enjoyed Saint Surfer & CEO by Mr Sharma much more."
2,Simplified Yogi?,"This book is a copy of the classic ""Autobiography of a Yogi""? The classic book, by the Yogi himeslef (By Paramahansa Yogananda) gives a very good description of the control of the thoughts, and some clear guidelines and the importance of living for the present moment. I would rather read the classic many times than this How-to cook book."
3,St.Louis own Chingy,Chingy who is from the Lou is okay but this is not the song thathe has that good on.It might actually be a good pop release but like as I said this is nothing more then a novelty track.Lyrics 2/10 Production 8/10 Overall 5/10 Give him 3 stars
4,A powerful reading competing with an action movie,"Most people who didn't like the movie will love this audio version. It is thrilling, it's funny and it's great. Though the story is still the same as in the blockbuster the overall atmosphere changes a little due to the exellent narration of Gates McFadden who with this could make up for her short appearance on-screen. The noises and her reading can send shivers down your spine at times and make you smile at others, a good choice for Bermans' story which learns to breathe here at last."
5,Wonderful!,Oh these are just so very good! You just have to try them! This is a big pack of them but you can buy smaller bags at the health food store or fresh market.
5,I enjoy his arrangements,Did you know he claimed he played the flute when he was drafted? Said he didn't want to have to carry a piano in his duffel bag.
1,Waste of Money!,"I make many delicious dishes using phyllo dough and wanted a wider brush to help preparation go faster. After I used this brush the first time, I discovered several bristles in the dish I had prepared as I was separating it for serving. I later checked the brush, and the bristles came out with a light pull. I wish I could get my money back as this brush is useless."
1,The worst product I ever bought on Amazon,"I was looking for a professional pastry brush for holiday baking. This brush fell apart as soon as I took it out of the wrapper. I rinsed it with water in an attempt to get rid of loose strands. I brushed egg wash over a pie, and released brush strands all over my pie. It's a waste of money, don't buy."
3,Not consistent quality,"I own two of these brushes. The first brush was of such great quality! None of the bristles fell out - I liked it so much, I ordered a second one to have on hand. I am quite disappointed to report that, with the second brush, the bristles do fall out! Not sure why one is good and one isn't - it's apparently not a consistently good quality product, which would explain so many of the mixed reviews. One brush does the job well, while the other one is going in the garbage so I don't have to worry about stray bristles getting into my food. I'd say this seems to be a ""buy at your own risk"" brush, you might get a good one, you might not."
2,Grueling,"This book is great if you are new to the grocery retail industry and you want to learn about differentiation. However, the author could have condensed this book to 50 pages instead of 200. Lewis is like a broken record bringing up the same points in every chapter, which makes it exhausting to read. The book is very general when it comes to specific strategies since the author is just like you or me looking from the outside in."
2,Not Really Worth the Read,"I wanted this book to be good, but it isn't. The writing is repetitive and too general. The book feels fluffy and bloated as a result.Much time is spent on the parent company Aldi, which starts to feel like it could be an interesting retail case to examine on its own, but considering that the German giant bought Trader Joe's long after TJ's founder had set the course and established the model and brand, Aldi just doesn't seem to be that important to understanding Trader Joe's.I was hoping for real insight, but instead I got overview material. It felt like a survey - a primer for someone who hasn't shopped Trader Joe's.This book should have been a tightly written magazine article instead. Too bad."
1,Trader Joe's and how not to write a review,"Author Len Lewis teaches us how to write a book without knowing anything about the subject. Not only same sentences are repeated several times throughout the book, even entire paragraphs. And it is not an edition mistake. Mr. Lewis uses cliches, and then explains the cliches. All that is said in 200 pages can be said in 10. Mr Lewis source appears to be the Fearless Flyer, which by the way it's 300 times better. Don't waste your time nor your money."
2,Painful to read.,"I found the book tiring and at times painful to read. Each successive page felt like it had at least one section that I'd read somewhere in the preceding pages. I did find some interesting info in the book, but it's organization and repetitivenss made it hard to enjoy."
3,repetitive but worth a look,I skipped a few chapters because it was focused too much on Aldi. I wish the authorwrote more about Trader Joe's rivalry with Whole Foods. You can easily finish the book in 1 afternoon.
3,incomplete/missing coverage,"Surprisingly, the book has no coverage at all on clustering. Although not many questions are asked about it on the exam, no serious SQL 2000 DBA should not be familiar with clustering technology. Also, the syntax of T-SQL commands are not fully explained. In many cases, entire clauses and options are left out. The book is fraught with errors. Surprisingly, the book's errata section at the Sybex site lists only a few corrections. By contrast, the Sybex 70-229 book by Israel and Jones is superb, filled with content helping you both PASS the test and MASTER the actual material. The errata section at the Sybex site for the 70-229 book is very comprehensive. However, I am a Sybex devotee and will admit that the selection out there for 70-228 is weak and this book - by default - is one of the better ones available. However, definitely read SQL Books Online and additional articles to supplement your studying. This book alone is NOT enough."
4,Improvements and what to use them for,"A recent grouping of 15 articles published in Scientific American, from 1995-2001. Though computing is still chugging along at Moore's Law's rate, these articles are still quite germane. Written at a level for a broad, educated audience, they give you a good understanding of the various key points in supercomputing.Issues include how to cluster computers into a functional unit, that can run these all efficiently (load balance). Or, how to make novel arrangements of computers into a supercomputer. Plus, of course, the steady progress of vector supercomputers, which has been the traditional route since Cray pioneered these in the 1970s.The articles are not just about how to make better supercomputers. They also discuss why you'd want to do so. The problems you can now tackle with better hardware. Meteorology being the classic (unclassified) application."
3,Massage cream,I did not notice any difference between this cream and any other Biotone product. I prefer light oil to this like Bindi.
1,No publishing date or number of pages given,"Who would be stupid enough to buy a book that only informs this is the ""4th addition"" - especially at this price?"
3,"Good book for bible study, too!","Sure this is a book about the ""history of mannipulative female behavior,"" and necessarily also about male mannipulative behavior, but it's worth the read alone just for her harvest of bible stories."
1,a book of babble,"Icould babble on and on like Elizabeth Wurtzel did when she wrote this book, but instead i'll make it short. Wurtzel is a great writer and I enjoy her sarcasm and delightful bitchiness. I loved her first book, ""Prozac Nation"" and had higher expectations for this one. It was 414 pages of babble- too much for me. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Lacks attitude,"Having read Wurtzel's witty and insightful memoir, Prozac Nation, I looked forward to reading another one of her books. I thought I'd get a kick out of reading a book about America's most notorious women, but it lacks Wurtzel's sardonic humor and clever insights that made the aforementioned memoir such a delightful read. This book is a disappointment, to say the least. I expected more from this talented writer."
5,An exercise in self respect,"What a great book! Not just for difficult women, but for all women. It deals with all the stereotypes women have dealt with for centuries. Sheltered or narrow minded women probably won't understand it and therefore will hate it-but who cares! I've still recommended it to everyone I know."
3,A good book but a bit difficult to follow at times,"This book has all the necessary material for an undergraduate probability text book. The only problem is that the material at times is not well presented. If you have encountered probability before you will find this book helpful, otherwise it might be a bit difficult to follow for those encountering probability for the first time."
1,Bad book,"This book just isn't any good. I have a degree in math, and I still couldn't make heads or tails of it (no pun intended). I had to look at and study other books in order to pass the class. Maybe people who excel at probability think this is great, but it's no way to learn the stuff initially. If you're forced to use this book as a text, get something else to support it. I really liked the Shaum's Easy Outline for Probability and Statistics and they also have one with worked problems. Both are by the same authors and very well done. After looking through their stuff, you just might have a chance of understanding this book."
2,Fundamental theories ommited.,"My stats professor said that this book is a classic, so I decided to buy it but after reading it and using that book for the semester I find that I did not grasp the fundamentals of probability theory. It seems that the book teaches by examples. For an alternative, try reading Modern Mathemathical Statistics by Dudewicz, which I think is a very good book."
4,10-4,"I am really enjoying the copies of the Highway Patrol, I ended up being a cop and I enjoy the whole simplicity of it all. Broderick Crawford is a one man show. brings back alot of memories. He always gets his man thanks"
2,It just doesn't play well in a DVD player,The first shipment was returned because the DVDs kept freezing in the DVD player. The second set I got was no better. It looks like the DVD labels are too thick and they get stuck in the player. I will have to download them to my computer and then burn my own DVDs
5,Great set delivers more than it promised.,"Ever notice how the 1 star reviewers listed here always complain about late delivery or high prices or some other issue, completely irrelevant to the question of product quality itself? No help whatsoever. Well, forget those cranks. This DVD is one of the most impressive classic TV restores I've ever seen. Clean, crisp picture, interesting plots and characters, lots of interesting camera work and gorgeous mid-century California landscapes. This is not an inexpensive set, sure, but do you really want to settle for a cheap, illegal bootleg on eBay? Besides, where else can you see Clint as an unknown extra?Quit reading these reviews and just buy it."
1,does not work,"Unless your goal is to create a herb mush, do not buy this product. While solidly constructed and nice looking, it is simply not properly designed to chop anything."
4,the father was royalty,"His fathers book is much better. If you are from sicily,and you grew up in this tradition,you could understand and make you heartsick for the old days.outsiders(no disrespect) could not possible know or understand something i have been taught since im a kid. Its impossible. What mr.bonnano said is""there is no more bonnano family"" ""i dont know these people""my tradition went from this thing of ours, to my thing."" believe it was in the 1983 book. He couldn have been more right"
5,great book,"To whom it may concern:I found this book very informative. If you want to learn about the history and the kind of life styles that were lived during the true mafia era, this is it. You will learn all about the Kennedy's and other very interesting items in history that everyone has been wondering about. You will want to read all that there is about the mafia after reading this book!"
3,Near rewrite of Man of Honor,"If the reader is a ""new"" devotee of mafia history this would be an excellent book to start your journey into the under world. If the reader is a long time mafiaphile then they have already read Man of Honor written by Bills' dad Joe and Sergio Lalli. There are probably forty pages of additional information in Bound by Honor than in Man of Honor but the new information was surprising and worth the purchase of the book. Well written, hard to put down."
4,Pop Goodness,"When I saw this compilation for sale, I just couldn't resist ordering it. I owned the debut album by the Pousette-Dart band on vinyl back in the mid 70s. I had first heard it playing at a local shop --- the legendary East-West Records in Orlando. I admit to having totally forgotten about this band during most of the 30 years since then, but listening to these wonderful songs again --- some of which are new to my ears --- brings back smiles galore. Jon Pousette-Dart was a very talented songwriter and singer and many of those tunes (""What Can I Say"" ... ""Dancer"" ... ""There's Been a Mistake"" ... ""Smile on Me"") should have been monster hits. These are simply, just very melodic, addictive pop songs. I prefer the 70s output that is on here, but the later material (other than a why-did-he-bother cover of ""Stand By Me"") is also quite good."
4,Wish the entire collection was availible.,"I had it all on vinal. but over the years, they have degraded. I wish they would make The 1st album, and ""Never Enough"" availible on CD."
1,Tech service & Customer Service SUCK,I was foolish enough to buy two of these units for my two grand-daughters and both units combined gave less than three hours of service before crapping out. Units were returned two times and have still not been repaired and returned. I received absolutely no satisfaction from Philips customer service and have now bought the girls I-Pod Nanos. I strongly advise people to not purchase these or other Philips products !!!
4,Meets my needs,I purchased this unit as a backup to our main vacuum and it seems to do what is needed. You do need to empty it more often than a bag unit. It is light and easy to get around. The color pattern is ugly for the unit.Bottom line I would do it again particularly for the price that I paid for it.
3,Neat but not durable,"This is a neat toy, especially since it resembles our vacuum and the girls liked vacuuming along side us. I use the past tense because after being dropped over a few times the handle broke off."
4,Bang on!,"First off, let it be known that this album was released overseas as The Quiet Boys' 3rd album (called Dazzle:Ultra Edition); it also contains several more tracks than the US version (check ... for the full tracklist) and different artwork. As for the domestic release...the ubiquitous Chris Bangs returns with a curious, hard-to-classify mixture of groove/jam stylings, drum n' bass, and smooth jazz. This is similar in sound to Bangs' previous Quiet Boys/Soundscape UK releases. I personally prefer his trip-hop/dub-oriented work (Mr. Electric Triangle, Anthea, 13th Sign), but I also respect the man's ability to jump between genres so skillfully. Not for everyone, but if you are familiar with Bangs' style, this is a recommended listen."
2,Look somewhere else,This book is useless. No cd. You cannot prepare for computer base TOEFL without computer program.
3,zap mama,"I love diversity... so, I'm very open to other kind of things (including music)... but, unfortunately... this is not my kind of music. Maybe somebody else will like it more than I do."
3,Not What I Was Looking For,"OK, it's carefully researched and has some interesting historical notes, but I was looking an in-depth exploration of sleep apnea. This isn't it. Also, I noticed the language was slightly odd in places. I think it was translated into English, not always successfully in spots."
1,Not worth the risk,"About a third of them, didn't record well. A lot of scratch noises of many of my discs - some would even stop playing - depending on the player."
2,DID I MISS SOMETHING?,"While the basic story Ms. Ellis was trying to tell was a good one, I kept flipping the pages back and forth asking myself, ""Did I miss something?"". This book was difficult to follow and poorly written."
3,Better this time around,"The first time I tried to read this book, I could not get into the story, it was so hard to follow. I decided to read it again, an this thim, I could follow along better with the story. Good Fences is about a black judge and his family, who lives in and all white neighborhood. The story is told mostly through Mabel, the wife's eyes. Mable makes friends with most of the white ladies in the neighborhood, but looses part of herself in the process. Tom, the husband also, changes trying to fit in. I didn't really like Snowy's characther, she bugged me, she always had something negative to say about everyone. Will the Spader's make it in there new neighborhood, and when there kids start to give them problems, how do they handle it, makes the books an ok read. The books is hard to follow at times, but stick with it."
4,Takes some time to get used to,"Went to the performance in Neve Zohar, Israel (October 2007) and afterwards wanted to buy a CD as close to what I heard as I could. This CD isn't it: it doesn't have the melodious flute (?) or the various percussions, and is less instrumental as such. This CD's emphasis is [Andalusian?] vocals with Paco on the guitar. So initially it was a disappointment as I was hoping for something else, more varied. But, the more I listen to it, the more the quality rings through and I really enjoy it. Although I do hope that in the future there will be a disc of the performance with all the musicians in his group."
5,The most beautiful sound...,"Samite brings out the warmth in music and draws you and drowns you in sweet, beautiful sounds. He is a legend. Great album!"
3,Nice story but too much bad language!,My brother (11) read it first and thought it was great but gave it three stars because of all the bad language (more swear words than storyline). I (also 11!) didn't finish it because of his warning. Anyone who wants to read this series I recommend reading Prophets Power first which has a better storyline and is much better written. Prophets Power isn't well related to the game in the way Hard Crash is. A great story!
1,Run while you can!,"Philips HDD6330 30 GB MP3 PlayerI'm usually an optimistic person, but with the Philips 30GB Go Gear, it's hard to be!I've had this MP3 player for less than four months, and the battery has already began to die on me! After looking at reviews on Amazon, I found out it's a common problem, and the main reason to avoid this device.One year warranty, you say? Don't count on it! Philips Customer/Technical help is both unapologetic and rude. They've sent me in circles many times. Giving me false ""reference numbers"" and worst of all, false hope that my MP3 player will every function normally.Remember; you get what you paid for. Sure, the Philips Go Gear is much cheaper than most other MP3 players, but the quality and service that goes along with it is terrible.Think about it before investing your hard-earned money on a substandard music player."
3,Love/Hate Relationship,"I like that it's a 30 GB mp3, but it's kind of hard to use. It uses Windows Mediaplayer, which is nice because more types of files can be compatible than an iPod, but I can't figure out how to put pictures or videos on it. Also, my left headphone didn't work until about 8 months after I bought this. I liked it because it was cheaper than an iPod, but now that I look back, I would have just spent the extra $100, although the headphones are better than iPod and the charger has a wall/computer USB in one and the carry case is nicer. The volume is rather low, however. I don't really recommend this."
3,Sticky!,"Like some of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in these. Yes they are a healthier option than traditional krispie treats, which is why they still rate a three. The taste is a little bland but ok, but they are very sticky and not easy for kids to bite. Be ready with the wet wipes for clean-up! I won't order more, if we even finish the rest."
3,Tasty and Addicting,Tastes good... Addicting. Tastes like rice crispy treats with a touch of peanut butter flavor. Expensive though if you do the math by the pound.
5,Great construction and well worth the price,I am very happy with the purchase. It is made of the thicker car cover like material instead of thin nylon. It is all black in color with a nice printed logo in the front. Fits my Kawasaki Ninja just fine.
4,an excellent book,"This is a well-written, entertaining book. I read it mostly due to my interest in sea-faring and the ""age of sail,"" as the author terms it. However, I found myself enjoying it just as much for the story it tells about the gradual discovery of a cure for a disease that crippled sea-faring nations for centuries. Particularly enlightening is the story of the bureacracy, the British Admiralty, that stubbornly ignored the potential cure, even as it suffered tremendous losses for its ignorance, and how vital privilege and influence is in challenging and changing such an establishment. The book's only minor flaw is that it focuses primarily on one country, Britain, without elaborating on how or why France or Spain failed to find a cause and a cure. I would recommend it highly."
5,Le Carre is simply the best !,"When I make my fantasy list of the best books I've ever read, Le Carre's trilogy about George Smiley is near the top. The author is difficult reading. You have to pour over most paragraphs, so as not to miss each nouance. Smiley is the ultimate father figure in espionage literature. You are comfortable when he is there and figuring things out, but you marvel at the complexity and difficulty of what he has to do, and how he does it. I commend this to anyone who loves rich characterization, and wants a book he or she will come back to again and again."
4,Simply Wonderful,"This is a very underrated Genesis album. It contains such a wide variety of musical styles and it is a true indication of the greatness yet to come.Trespass contains some classics that most Genesis fans would recognize such as ""Looking for Someone"" and ""The Knife"", both featuring terrific vocals from Peter Gabriel. But I think the real charm of Trespass are the lesser known tracks. In particular, ""Stagnation"" and ""Dusk"" are two of the finest things that Genesis has ever done. The vocals, keyboards, guitar and flute are terrific on these tracks.This was recorded before Phil Collins and Steve Hackett joined the band so it has a slightly different feel than the better known follow up efforts (""Nursery Cryme"", ""Foxtrot"" and ""Selling England By The Pound"").Give it a couple of listens and I promise it will grow on you."
4,Underated cd,This is actually quite a good cd despite it not selling very well when it first came out( only second cd or album at the time for them). Visions of angels and dusk are my favorites on the cd althogh all the songs are very good. The knife is the hardest rocker on the cd
3,The Formative Years,"Trespass shows Genesis improving instrumentally over their first album (which I liked also)but not yet at their peak. John Mayhew was an inadequate drummer (too basic rock) for a group of this nature. Anthony Phillips is not in the same league with Steve Hackett. No moog or melotron yet, as Tony Banks just plays piano and organ (well). Only ""The Knife"" really stands out, and even then it's a little too psych to be in the league with their classic material. Still a good buy and their roots are fascinating. Actually I find myself listening to From Genesis To Revelation more often than Trespass though."
3,A Decent but Flawed Read,"Crossover was a good way to kill a lazy afternoon, but little else. The story was supposed to be a big event--Scotty, Spock, and mcCoy together with the NG crew. The story ranks as entrertaining, but implausible. McCoy has reached the unusual age of 145, and no one can stop talking about that.Scotty steals a 100 year old working ship from a museum (that happens to have a cloaking device, no less) and enters Romulan space. Picard won't mount a rescue operation for Spock, but will for Scotty. It's a mess if you think about it too hard. I give it three stars only because of the intermittant discussions between Spock and his Romulan students regarding pacifism v. totalitarianism. Very inciteful and interesting in a novel that is otherwise brain candy."
2,Small and weak,This is truly an entry level sub. Do not expect anything more. It is very easy to push its limits quickly.
4,good sub for the money,Does it's job prety good. Stylish looking. The only drawback - doesn't have auto turn on/off.
5,great sound,great sub for the price...nice clean sound... powered by the yamaha rxv363...no snap crackle or pop with this one...handles the bass very well
5,Awesome Sub,"Believe me when I tell you, the picture doesn't do the sub. justice. This thing has depth with a commanding presence. at 100w, it's enough to feel an average living or media room with lows without disturbing your neighbors. Adjust the volume to satisfy your listening desire, or let your AV receiver control it for you. If you wanted to, you could use it as a stand alone surrounding system since it has connections for that on the rear. Yes, it isn't timed, but I have it connected to a outlet that shuts it off when the t.v. is turned off, and if your receiver has switched outlets on it, plug in to that...No biggy. For this price, it's a good investment."
5,Excellent woofer for the price,This product is great for the price and sounds excellent. This completely improved my home theater sound compared to the small woofer that came with the set. You can not go wrong with this item. It delivers crisp lows without having too much bass even at full volume.
4,Deep!,You want a sub that will shake the room? well this is it! Your neighbors will call the police or think that there is a earthquake. and the best thing you can stack them! you can have as many as you want to get that live concert sound. That's all I have to say about this chest thumping sub.
4,Great Subwoofer for the price,"I wanted a very inexpensive subwoofer to replace the one I had. And this one is great. This one replaced a 12"" Infinity subwoofer than I had for about ten years. The Infinity finally bit the dust. The sound of this one is way better than the Infinity.Love the lows, love the sound. It may be a bit bulky for some, but the sound is better than the more expensive one I had."
5,Great Sub,"I have this sub for a month now and it is amazing. Movies sound spectacular. If you have this sub and think it sucks, perhaps you need to upgrade your receiver."
4,"Big Sound, Small Price & Size!","I recently purchased this subwoofer to replace a very expensive (and large) Cerwin Vega unit that went bad. I decided on the Yamaha because of the low cost, smaller size, and the fact that the cabinet was built very solid. When I first hooked it up, I could not believe my ears. The sound was better than the $300.00 Cerwin Vega!Bottom Line: Bigger is not always better. This unit provides a rich and full sound that will make your home theater/music experience much more enjoyable without breaking the bank."
3,NOT a mini subwoofer,"I searched high and low to replace my older mini Advent sub-woofers, which are passive, un-powered units that barely gave the sound system any 'humph', or 'woomph'. So, putting ""mini sub-woofer"" in the search, numerous units were presented. Searching and reading through the many, the Yamaha and its reviews caught my interest. One was ordered, and it arrived today. The box was big, and thought it was just well packed. Opened the box, and lo-and-behold.....this is a HUGE unit, over 13"" cube, at least twice as big as the Advents!!. Haven't taken it out of the box yet cause I don't know what and where I'll place it, if even keep it. So, as it stands have no opinion on its performance, just to say MINI it is NOT. How and why it showed up in the search is beyond me. The only thing I can think of is that Amazon's search just picked up 'subwoofer' and displayed it. They should be more careful with the 'search'."
5,A Treasure!,This treasure features an effectively paraphased version of Psalm 139. Children are sure to love the comforting message and the beautiful illustrations. Buy the series.
4,My husband will love this product,once he has learned to make a larger amount of spagetti. He is in the early stages of perfecting his dough.
2,Huge and heavy,"Didn't even turn it on. This thing is heavy and thick, seems off balance and ready to fall with one wrong nudge against the desk."
