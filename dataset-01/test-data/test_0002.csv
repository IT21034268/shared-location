2,A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE' ABORE',"Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the movie itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Implausable plot, rediculous faux feel good moments.Diane Lane is so better than this cheesy little movie ..its Money Pit meets The View. Lets invent a new genre of movies, lets call this Terra Cotta Trite.I wont divulge the plot, because you can't prove a negative. Lets just say that if you want to see Diane Lane at her best, Unfaithful is a better bet.If you enjoy film that insults your intellect while shooting pretty scenes country side, then by all means enjoy!"
2,IS OK...I GUESS,"THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN. SAW IT ONCE DONT CARE TO SEE IT AGAIN. MY OPINION OF COURSE."
4,Not Bad...for a chick flick,"Interesting!! This film takes place in Italy and surrounds itself with a character who recently gets divorced, and finds herself, at the urging of her friends (who happen to be gay) to get away from it all and take sometime to herself...little do they all know (including her) that she ends up going out there, and never coming back to the States to live. This is a story of a woman who is looking for more in life than just the normal basic stuff. She wants to live her life to the fullest and really enjoy what the world has to offer her. Good film, great message for all!!"
4,A light comedy,"Diana Lane is perfect in this role. She owns a cosmical beauty and it's extraordinary nice too.Since a winner executive but unhappy woman, decides to make a twist of fate in Toscana, she will experience a whole different conceptions about the love and the sense of the friendship. Her only truly fellows are two lesbians,the charming and always beloved Italia seduces her in many ways is obviously another incorporean actor in the screen.The homagge to La dolce vita is very smart clue in the sense you can be happy if you're really commited with will and constant desire.Share this one with your couple, fianceÃ© or beloved girl or boy friend."
4,Excellent,"I loved this movie. If a relationship falling apart is unrealistic, you can count yourself lucky. I thought it was very realistic. Moving to Italy can only be done with a lot of money,but if I had the dough, I'd have gone right after I saw UTS. It made me feel good, and I recommend it, as I have to other people.Plus Diane Lane is hot."
4,A pleasant way to spend an evening,"Diane Ladd plays a woman who has just been unceremoniously dumped by her husband. In an attempt to cheer her up, her two friends offer her tickets to go to Tuscany. While she's there, she impulsively buys a villa and then wonders what she's gotten herself in for. She hires an eccentric group of Polish workers and sets about rebuilding the villa and her life. There are a few bumps along the way, but she finally succeeds. The scenery in this movie is breathtaking and it alone is worth the price of admission. There are times when the overacting is painful and there are several lapses in credibility but all in all it's a pleasant way to spend an evening."
3,So so tale under the Italian landscape,"I loved the Italian landscape, and I think it was best aspect of the film. As for the plotline and the film itself, I'd have to say I was disappointed. With all the rave reviews about the film, and it's long cinema run, I guess I was looking for something more. This is one of those movies that will probably take a second showing in order to grow on me.Otherwise, it is worth viewing if you enjoy the theme of a woman who escapes, or should I say, runs away to beautiful Italy to live a somewhat carefree life that still does not allow her to escape disappointment and a slight experience of heartache with an Italian hunk! The ending did not leave me with that warm feeling."
2,"Beautiful scenery, but thats about all","Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing."
1,Canon NB-5L Battery Pack,"The battery I got has a terrible quality. With a full charge over night (~8 hours), the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage, shot around 20 pictures. Versus to the original battery pack with the camera, the original battery can last over two days normal usage, shot around > 100 pictures. I believe the vendor selling degraded products."
1,"OMG, a complete waste of time","Having read the novella Rollerball prior to the first version being made, and having seen that one on the big screen, I awaited the remake. It came & went big screen in near record time. That should have been warning enough. Unfortunately I rented this piece of **** and even worse, I watched the whole thing. All the time thinking, it can't be this bad, it has got to get better. It is that bad, and it never got better. Other than the title, and some aspects of the game, nothing in common witht he original book. Very little in common with the first movie. James Caan vs. who ever he was. No contest Caan. Even Jean Reno is wasted in this mess. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorlly shot, poorly edited. And loud, I mean Loud, you know LOUD. I really wanted to give this zero stars, but that was not an option."
1,A Total Failure,"If you've seen the original Rollerball staring James Caan, then you'll probably want to give this remake a miss. It is no longer set in a future controlled by corporations, it is set in the near present which is pretty much like reality. The hero doesn't hold a candle to James Caan.It does have plenty of action, if mindless action is to your taste. The rollerball arena is poorly designed which makes following the action difficult at times. The villiam is just another greedy businessman/crook with nothing to make him stand out from a 1000 other businessman/crooks in other movies.My adive? Save your money and get a copy of the original Rollerball."
1,ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.,"I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would."
2,Design confuses some into burning kettle,"I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source)."
4,criminally under rated doom metal!,these guys were the cream of the doom metal crop late 80s/early 90s.melodically heavy and great musicanship they are very black sabbath insired and can definetly pick up the pace and move.thi live cd is recorded very well and candlemass was in rare form for these recording.get a piece of history buy this cd.
3,Ask yourself: is it worth it?,"I wouldn't get this unless you are completley gaga over BESD. He is expensive for all he is. I suggest buying something more fun with your 30 bucks. Perhaps Zoid's Energy Liger! You'd have a lot of money left over, and he's worth it!My final comment: don't get this unless you are really serious."
2,One of my favorite toys!,This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. The one I got came with the card Shadow Spell. It's a cool toy so if you can't find anything at Toys 'R' Us or somthing buy this!
2,"So much potential, but one overwhelming problem","On paper, this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs. In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit ""to make some sound"" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket. If I could have disabled the TV Guide, I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder."
1,Engineering gone bad,"I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS.It's got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. They last about 2 months(or less), after that they do not respond to any controls and keep turning on and off on their own. My first one got so hot it could have set the house on fire had I not caught it. The hard drive locks up and keeps sounding like an old pulse tone telephone.Did Pioneer get rid of all educated engineers?I noticed this unit cannot even be purchased on -line at any web site anymore. This is sad after only a few months on the market. I will unload this piece of junk back to the dealer and buy any other brand but another Pioneer."
2,Very disappointed,"Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again."
2,Shrinkage,"These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."
1,bad,"got a different pattern and the dye fades on everything even me, even after 5 washings do nor waist your money"
4,My wife loves them!,"Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale."
4,"""Kid, I don't care what you do...""","A guilty -- but perhaps not all that guilty -- pleasure. A small comedic indie made by Brian De Palma way back in hisGreetingsandHi, Mom!days, it still retains a charming, if somewhat adolescent, absurdism. Tommy Smothers plays a corporate dropout in a loveless relationship who yearns to become a tap-dancing magician, taught by none other than Orson Welles's Mr. Delasandro in full pretentious mentoring mode. Add Katherine Ross as the adoring new girlfriend, Allan Garfield as a brassiere maker in search of his perfect woman, and especially the wonderful John Astin as a laid off executive-turned-derelict-turned-executive and you have the sort of bizarre, off-kilter type of fun movie you would have seen as a college student at a midnight showing in theaters during the late 60's/early 70's. Innocently subversive.And can any movie that bills (correctly) an early Katherine Ross as ""Terrific-Looking Girl"" be all that bad?"
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,wow I had the exact same things happen to the one I got for my kid bad motion sensor and bad display. he wanted it so much we tried returning it twice after the third one didn't work even my six year old said forget it. I wish i could have given it a black hole instead of 1 star. JUNK!!!!!!!!
4,"For the price, very reasonable!","The product was exactly as I had expected, and came quickly. I had to buy two for an expo, not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality, but fortunately, they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
4,"Good, but not great","You know, I read this ine, and I did like it- a lot- but it didn't crack me up like _Lords and Ladies_. This really is a funny book, as humorous fiction goes, but against my Pratchett standards, it doesn't quite measure u"
5,Small Gods - Terry Pratchett,"A lovely story, exposing the underbelly of religion amusingly and, in the final section, reverentially - the ending brings tears to my eyes."
2,Missing pages in ebook,"I'm a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he's created and the incredibly intelligent books. While I greatly enjoy the book itself, I was highly disappointed with the ebook because it is missing numerous pages in the version for the iphone. Unfortunately I passed the deadline for a return. Missing one or two pages is not appropriate but not a big deal. There were at least 4 places that were missing 4-6 pages in the iphone version."
5,Native American Project,My kid found this very helpful for a school project. Another student in her class had the book and she wanted her own corp.
5,the best of,"this cd collects some of the best metal massacre. whether it is fantasy ,etal or death and thrash it is all here. buy it!!"
3,"OK overall, though fabric is thin.","The fabric is thin, and therefore, when light shines through it, the toile design is not really visible. My plan is to buy some off-white fabric and sew it on as backing."
1,Measurements????,"Since I can't get Babies R Us to write me back, I thought I'd try this. What are the measurements of this valance? Length? Width? Anyone who can offer this information would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you!"
1,cross contamination,"The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great ""silent damage"" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet."
1,The Gluten-Free Bible,"There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer."
1,"Great attitude, if only the info was great...","Although Jax presents the gluten free lifestyle with a great attitude, anyone serious about the diet knows that it isn't this easy. The hard info that Jax gives in this book is outright wrong and could be very dangerous to some one new to the diet. She needs to loose the casual approach and get real about being truly gluten free."
1,Irresponsible!,"What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, ""Rx for Health""? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs. Lowell's book is certainly not one of them!"
1,Socialite celiac,"Although this book had good information, it had to be ferreted out. It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children. She had a snit because the hostess did not cater to her every whim. She demonstrated rude behavior that I would not have tolerated.I would have prefered she give me good information on common occurances on living the 'real' life."
3,Thomas Ince's Antiwar Epic,"Released shortly before America entered World War I, producer Thomas Ince's ""Civilization"" (1916) was an ambitious, partially successful attempt to match the artistry and scale of D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation."" By incorporating religious symbolism with social commentary, Ince and director Raymond West crafted a film that struck a responsive chord with the audiences of its day. However, once America became involved in the war, ""Civilization"" was withdrawn from circulation. Despite its historic significance, Ince's pacifist epic languished in obscurity until recent years. Though marred by weak acting and dated melodrama, the picture remains of historic interest for its antiwar sentiments and religious message. ""Civilization"" did not prevent America from going to war, but it did help the country find a spiritual and moral unity during that turbulent period."
4,"Good strong basket, but no instructions","I use this to carry some heavy groceries, and I haven't had any troubles yet. The quality is good, and it's very strong and durable. It's a little dorky looking, but gets the job done. It came with absolutely no instructions, and I called the company and they faxed them to me. It was somewhat tricky to attach to my bike, but that's probably more because of my lack of skills.I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you're going to carry heavy things."
5,Good choice for anyones needs ..,This was a good choice...good quality..Great price too...My husband had a Problem attaching it to the bike only b-cause he had the bike fork on backwards on the Ladies Bike ....we received the basket abt. a week after we ordered it...even though it said 4-6 weeks...happy with that too !!
4,Worth buying?,"I really loved this album. It has good lyrics and wonderful messages. Don't know if you have the same taste as me? I also love Jaci Velasquez, Clear, and DC Talk. It is definitely worth the 12 bucks."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This CD is very much UNLIKE step 2. I don't know who wrote the questions on this program, but they clearly were not familiar with usmle format or usmle content. In agreement with the other reviews, the questions were totally random and kind of off the wall. If they have the audacity to charge 59.00, they should at least live up to the price tag. You are better off using the practice CD that USMLE gives you for free."
3,Nasty.................,This goes back to basic METAL. When METAL RULED THE WORLD!!!!!!!! Pick it up its worth the price.......
3,"Richard takes on the ""Top 40""","Another early '70s studio departure for Richard - in a production yielding almost nothing like his dynamic stage shows of the era. On 4-5 cuts, he sings like there's no tomorrow: Brown Sugar, Born On The Bayou, and a new song, co-written by Producer H. B. Barnum, Green Power, undoubtedly one his greatest recordings, vocally, and in relevance to the times. He adds a rare touch of irony to the proceedings, which will surprise even the most ardent worshippers.No acoustic piano heard at all; obstrusive lady chorus getting in Richards' way and in the way of the band. On the few tracks where they are properly mixed, however, they sound fine.Great title tune which was played like a single at the time - in the mood and structure of many '50s reflections, it coulda/shoulda been released as a 45 rpm...then Little Richard would have had another Top 40 hit for himself."
2,Soot-covered Sentimentality,"Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping ""Germinal"". For the best critique of Dickens, read ""Against Nature"" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."
3,Still Hard Times,"This book isn't Oliver Twist. This book reminds me of Animal Farm, only not as comical, but the social commentary is the same. What would the world be like if children were raised without that magical sense of wonder and pretend? What was the world like before the working class was not respected for all the hard work they do? Those definately would be hard times. This is just the scenario in this book. In this book, Coketown is a hard place. The factory workers toil day in and day out yet get no respect from ""civilized society"". Louisa and Thomas Gradgrind are raised with books and facts and no room in the world for emotion, and then Sissy, a carnie orphan, enters their world as each spiral in different directions due to their upbringing. What happens? Hard times indeed but in the end, the human spirit triumphs even if not everyone gets to see that wonderful ending."
1,"Boring, Dull, one of the worst books ever written","This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."
2,Zzzzzzz,"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"
4,Better then the last.,It had more challenges and characters then the 1st Maximum Impact. The original Japanese language makes it better for the fans of the series.
5,Real ...,"This ... is keepin it real. He got something to smoke to, somethin to ride to, something to get yo freak on to. It's an all around good cd. I can listen to it several times in a row and everytime I rehear a song - I feel it like it was the first time I heard it. Of course big snoop helps keep it bossed up.YOU GOTZ TA DO IT!!!!!"
3,battles,every time i try shaking it for like 2 hours i just wont get me into a battle i have had this toy for 1 yr. and yet no battle but it is still a really realy good toy
1,are you kidding me?,"I have 2 boys and several nephews. I know about and buy a lot of toys for boys. This is by far the biggest piece of junk that I have come across in a long time. The graphics- very poor. The overall ease of use and entertainment value- also very poor. This reminds me of the ""electronic"" happy meal games. I bought two PETs and both were defective and had to be returned to the store. The PET launches into battle mode via a motion sensor which is activated when you shake the PET. Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."
5,This looks awesome!,"i have seen the reviews and commercial and this thing is so awsome! I cant wait to get mine this christmas! Why buy this? Because it pretty much brings the cartoon to life! Yes it may have Mr. Game and Watch grapics(if u know who he is) but overall this game is like the show! So the graphics come right back and hit you in the face because the graphics dont really matter. and one more thing....... this thing, this thing is awesome!"
5,Anonymous,"I don't know why anyone would complain about this product. I got it for $30 and it works great. It DOES NOT play WMA for those of you wondering, but I have a program that converts WMA to MP3, so that's no problem for me. It was a little confusing figuring out how to program the FM radio, but I figured it out myself in about 5 minutes. If you're really having trouble you can look online at www.sonicblue.com/support. It gives you all the help you'll need. I'm not sure of how the battery life is other than what the product claims, no problems there. I've already got it hooked up in my car too, and it works in there. The picture makes it appear as if there really are only a few buttons, but the large circle has play/pause/on, forward, back, stop/off buttons that are all multifuncional as well as a special button that enables different play modes as well as the radio. It's not very complicated. So far I love this thing. Get one if they're still only $30"
2,I just dont understand,"Maybe it is just me but this is some real crap. Dont get me wrong, I like black metal, and not just the symphonic stuff like Dimmu Borgir and later Emporer. This album i akin to someone pissing in my ear. There is almost no quality in the musicianship. Repetitive and just plain boring. If you want to hear REAL old-school but also excellent BM go and get Satyricon's The ShadowThrone and anything by Mayhem. Dont waste your time with this drivel. im not a kid either but beleive what you will."
2,Anno Dracula Boring,"The book was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining. The characters were not believable and left me with wanting to many unanswered questions. The author took to many liberties with facts. All in all, I just didn't care for the book, skipped thru pages to end it so I could go on to more enjoyable reading. Amazon offers so many options and choices that I'm bound to pick a lemon once in awhile. I always read the brief description of the book before I buy but in this book that wasn't enough."
1,Not worth your time!,"As of now I am completing drivers Ed. We take tests over this book, and I feel it is rather outdated for what it is being used for. The pictures are helpful, but the text I found boring and most of the text seemed just to be fill. They streched out simple procedures, and filled the usefull information with unimportant details. If you want to pass the test, read your state drivers manual. If you think this will help you, try it, but I warn you, its not worth it. Your state drivers manual is worth you time, check it out!"
2,Politics?,"A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read."
1,No Editor? Mediocre Content.,"After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future."
2,Good ONLY for total beginner,I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
4,great book,"Great book on the order of combat handgunnery almost a dead copy of Massad ayoob combat handgunnery even a forward by Ayoob its ok it reads like all the rest of these type of books do, can you shoot someone, then on to well you are gonna be arrested if you do even if you are in the right, then a few brief words about outdated handguns and ammo. Almost a ringer for Massad ayoobs combat handgunnery try col jeff cooper and wiley clapp"
3,Dated but still useful,This book would be excellent if it were updated. It contains a lot of useful info but needs to be brought up to the 21st century.
5,Highly Recommended!,"There are many, many resources out there for those citizens that are considering carrying a weapon for personal or home defense. Many if not most of these have been written by current or former law enforcement officers and may contain tips and guidance that are not optimal for private citizens.This book is written by a private citizen who has attended extensive and exhaustive training from some of the best in the business, and is now offering his insight from ""the regular civilian"" perspective.I have read many books and periodicals on this subject over the past thirty years. I still learned quite a bit and had to rethink a number of ideas I had assimilated from other authors.In my opinion, this book is a mandatory addition to the reference shelf of any armed citizen."
4,Armed Response,"This is a very good book for the person who plans to carry concealed firearms. The logic is clear and the recommendations are sound. Unfortunately, the proof reading is atrocious. In the early chapters paragraphs are repeated and there are other other problems. I lined out several sentences that were misplaced and had to tape in a loose page that came with the book. The book is sound and I would have given it a 5 if the proof reader had not messed it up."
4,Great content...poor publishing,"The book by David Kenik has a lot of great points concerning self defense...however, in my copy, there were numerous paragraphs cut off at the end of the page, with no continuation on the following page...at least a half dozen or more (I'm trying to be coservative) instances of this happening. The content is very worthwhile. Just wish whoever printed the book would've taken greater care...esp. when the paperback book cost approx $16. If the same care was taken in self defense as in publishing, the fight would be one and done."
3,A decent read...,"This book is good on structure and well organized for retention, with some very good points and very approachable examples and analogies. It is not a must read for everyone, and the insights provided are fairly straightforward. It moves pretty quickly and stays focused, so its worth your time if you feel that confrontations are a weakness."
5,IF You Could Buy Only One Book,"I read this when it was first published and then bought it for each staff member as one of our required primers. I also gave one to each of my Board members. If there is one book I wish had existed 30 years ago, this is it."
2,Not for me,"I thought that this might be interesting, but language was too old and I found it to be boring. I deleted it soon after."
4,Overall Good Book,"Book was great and a nice read... but the cover was dirty, don't know why Amazon would sell a dirty book."
4,Wonderful Teen Adventure in Alaska,"This is a strong message book - with the message being that even teenagers have to have moral character and live or die by their word. It's a story that is timeless, but is told like a folk tale, with country aphorisms and speckled with crusty old timers and real life problems. A good book for all ages, but particularly appealing to teenagers who should be able to relate to the problems of the teens in this story."
1,Lousy Camera,"This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally ""twisted"".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one."
1,Piece of junk,Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
3,Weird sound,Not a bad concert but the sound is uneven. I tried every permutation on my Yamaha DSP A-3090 processor to fix the problem but failed. I can't figure it out considering that this is a recent recording.
2,Audio= Very Poor,First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed. The front speakers and center channel were OK. The rear was terrible. The overall audio quality was the worst I have heard. Listened to it once and went back the next day thinking my set up had to be wrong. Tried two other DVD's and both were fine. Suggest you try something else.
2,poor sound mix on many of the tracks,"Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"It sort of felt like they mostly performed with the attitude that I'm doing this for free; I'm not putting any more into it than I have to. Mark Knopfler's performance was lackluster to say the least. The only one who really seemed to put their heart into it was Elton John. I can't say that I wasted my money, but it won't be the most listened to DVD on my shelf!"
5,Excellent Concert,"A great concert. I found the sound to be excellent, the performances great, a must have. The percussionist by the way is Ray Cooper ( I think). He is excellent, very flamboyant and fun to watch; which is probably why he is shown so often."
2,Disappointed with the sound quality,"If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore."
5,Lens Cap,This lens cap works good. It is of good quality and fits my camera lens filter with no problem. I put it on my Canon SX40 with with this size adapter and filter.
2,Disappointing - additional equipment needed,"We purchased this for use in a first-grade classroom. After reading the reviews and descriptions we ordered this tape. On receiving it we found that every participant needs a set of dumbbells and ankle weights. Nowhere did we see indications that additional additional equipment was needed. We are now deciding whether to return this tape unopened. Please be aware that this tape is of dubious benefit unless you have access to dumbbells (the bar-bell type, not the student type) and ankle weights."
3,"Overall, a good book, but something still seems missing....","At the end of the book, the author stresses how the purpose of the book was to focus on the victims, rather than the sensationalism of the crime. Yet, throughout the book, I found very little to help me to connect to the victims, whom I'm sure were wonderful girls. I think the book would have reached me more deeply had it been written from the first person voice, rather than the author referring to herself in the third person. I also wonder about her insights on scenes during which she was not present. Nevertheless, the book touched me and I pray for the victims and the families involved. I believe her portrayal of the media was right on target."
5,A families point of view,"I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these ""mystery 4 men"". I was glad to hear a book had been written from ""their"" point of view. When I say ""their"" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."
5,Works Great,No loss in audio quality and I'm no longer tied to the computer. This cord is so long I can get up and go get my coffee without disconnecting.
2,poor fit ruins sound - avoid this product,"Product arrived promptly and in good condition. However, the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones. If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable, the sound is hollow and nearly silent. If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly, the sound is great. Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors. I'm looking for another productNote: this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds (with iphone controls). The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products/accessories, so this cable is definitely at fault"
5,Good Value,"This was a great product, just what I needed and just as pictured. I use these to sit on a couch and watch video on my computer and they work great."
5,Exactly as advertised,Nothing really to say. Works fine. No crackle. Fairly sturdy and hold up against weather. Great for DJ equipment or in the house.
1,Didn't get what I ordered,I ordered the headphone extension (1 male end/1 female end) and got a 15 foot auxiliary plug (2 male ends). I decided that it would be cheaper to buy a stereo coupler of 2 female ends than it would be to ship it back.
1,Laughing out loud,As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress.
1,Don't buy NuVision Edition,"I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"
5,Simply well done.,"I bought this Cd after watching the movie. I thought the movie was amazing, this CD is quite literally out of this world. The music is hot yet playful, it's sultry yet cool. This has done what most albums don't - sound good."
5,TRIPLETS IS WORTH ALL THREE STARS!,"Play one of the three versions of the Academy Award nominated (hopefully winning) title track, ""Belleville Rendezvous"" and tell me it is not the most unique and inspirational song of the year. I can't get it out of my head! The film is a knockout and Ben Charest's magic in the music is worth every dime."
2,What Happened?,"Okay, first off, I love Loving Family. I have the Twin Time and all of the accessories AND the old dolls. But when I received the new dolls as I gift, I was shocked. Mattel has completely changed the dolls from sleek to chunky. These dolls apparently look a lot like the ones they made back in the 90's. If you want dolls for your Loving Family house, try to get the old ones on eBay."
5,Perfect match,"I couldn't find my original and I couldn't charge my camera, I was begining to panic because the holidays were coming. The order came fast and saved my holiday photo's."
3,It's a battery charger,"Does it's job. I can't rate above 3 stars because it is a battery charger and I find no real joy from this product, but the need was apparent when we lost our old one."
5,Exactly what I ordered.,This product is exactly what I ordered. The same charger that originally came with my camera. I am very pleased. (and happy that I am able to bring my camera back to life!)
2,JANET JACKSON - VELVET ROPE TOUR,"Well another one of my first dvd purchases...I found this concert very poor...it did nothing for me... the sound quality was poor, The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle, Janet's performance was glitzy... but sadly something was missing...my advice is puchase Janet's later DVDS..."
4,"Spectacular Production Of Lights, Dance, Energy and Janet","This is a very good live concert VHS tape with high energy and lots of colorful lights. Janet Jackson gives a 2 hour, non stop, performance in a 1998 release with Janet at her peak performance. The majority of her songs she sings live, not lip-synching. The experience of watching the video is close to being at a live concert in one of the front rows."
1,Low quality dvd,"I know I am just writing this review now but the dvd I purchased was not in good quality. I am not sure it because the actual concert was 10 to 15 year old but I did not enjoy this copy at all.thank you,Charisse Chase"
2,Are we discussing the same DVD?,Mostly crowd noises and Ms Jackson basking in the adoration -- did I miss something?
1,Wack She ain't Michael,"Janet Jackson works very hard.I will give her that But when she isn't biting Madonna, she is trying hard to be a 2nd tier Version of Her Brother which she will never be able to do.She can't sing& is a So-So Dancer.The Music&Production is what really has Her Name up in Lights in the First&Only Place."
3,Hmmm....Ok at best...,"Janet Jackson is a very talented women. I will give her that much...but she tries way to hard to be Madonna. Madonna did the whole tie me up thing before you, Janet, and it was obvious that you copied her. But it's all good. The show was great, and unlike Madonna (who sings NO old songs) Janet sang almost all of her greatest hits from the 80s which was awesome. She could have put some more color into the show...and gosh take off those black slacks. The dancer with the short bleached blonde hair was annoying to no extent but the other dancers were cool. The only problem with this concert, is that the transition from one song to the other is really awkward. She should have really thought out the order of each song much better than what she actually did. She should have opened with a hit song too, and done much more with Got 'til It's Gone. Buy this video, it's fun to watch....but lacks a lot of thought."
5,Like it a lot!,"I'm a music/movement teacher and needed something to help me lug my Altec IM7 back and forth with that would be convenient.After reading reviews from others online I decided this harness seemed like a good bet, and I was right.It holds my IM7 snugly and makes it easy for me to carry it around without my needing to take it in and out of a bag in order to use it.Strap feels just fine, quality seems great, and I'm very happy with it overall."
4,nice stickers,"These are nice stickers and a fair quantity for the price, however my kids prefer the activity books which allow them to decorate scenes on the plastic coated booklet with the stickers. These stickers are not meant to be stuck to the book, but can be used to decorate other things or wear on their clothes, etc."
5,dinasours,the only thing that I wished the book were bigger and thicker... but in another word the book was great
2,Brilliant Movie - Dreadful DVD,"Kino Video ought to be embarrassed to release such a poor quality print on DVD. What everyone has said about the transfer is true. It is truly dreadful. There are better copies of this film on VHS. At one point Joan backs away from the camera in horror until her performance is nothing but a fuzzy blur.Joan Crawford's work deserves better treatment. Hopefully the upcoming Crawford boxed set from Warner Bros will include a better version of this film. Keep your fingers crossed.That said, I love this movie, even with it's ridiculous ending. That milk! Those eyes! But why does Joan's character cry out in warning at the end of the film only to smirk pridefully as she walks away?"
5,Real Fear,Joan Crawford creates a portrait of fear that will have you on the edge of your seat. We expect a winning performance from her but we also get Jack Palance in a stellar turn as her husband. There's also dazzling camera work that makes brilliant use of light and shadow. This is a must for Crawford fans and anyone else who appreciates how movies were made back in the 40s and 50s.
2,Masochist Dearest,"Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance."
3,My VIEWS!!,"This book was pretty good. There are a lot of key things I felt was important for men and females to know. I especially loved how at the end she broke down some key topics that many of us females are facing today. This book talks about love, relationships, homosexuality (no pro's), poverty, heartache, etc! So many emotions wrapped up in one. This was a slow read for me and it took over a month. I would start some, then put it down for a week and finish back. It wasn't a stay up all night page turner, but it def was a good read!"
5,Great Book,Sister Souljah is so down to earth...no pretense. I love it. I am giving this to my 16 year old granddaughter to read. Let's be real. Our young ladies need to hear the truth in a way that they can relate.
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,"This book was amazing!!! If there is one book that everyone (white, black, latino, etc) should read, it is definitely this book! It is very hard to set this book down once you begin to read it. The scary thing about this book is that it is true. The information about the thousands of African-American youth living in welfare hotels and damaged families are present in the US. After finishing this book, you should be more inspired in help others in need.I love this book and I highly recommend it."
1,"RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER","And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
1,Whitey is oppressing you?,They agreed to publish and largely distribute one of her books. Most whites in this country will never have such a luxury. Hypocrite. Racist.
4,Enjoyed this book a lot,"I agree with what Sista Souljah has to say about being socially retarded and just plain not knowing about different types of people that are no good for you. In life I have learned that there are people who you will meet that are not worthy of you knowing on any level. It's nothing personal, but there are just some people who you will meet in life that are just full of it and have no aspirations, goals and/or plans in life. Sista Souljah does speak the truth on many issues such as racism, sexism, being intelligent and at the same time being overlooked in the black community, poverty and education.I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to question our status as Africans living in America."
5,this is nice,This book was beautiful. I still can't believe all those things happened to her. Some people have the worst. I think she is a good symbol of the Black woman. Keep on keepin' on Sista!
3,My 1st FW experience.,"I have not listened to this disc in some time so keep that in mind as I tell you that I remember it being decent, but nothing outstanding. Being a prog fan, some will probably want to horse-whip me after learning that I have never really listened to Fates Warning much-yet. I've been meaning to get into more of their stuff, but well, you know how life is....That said, I specifically remember the opening track being OUTSTANDING. The rest has not stuck in my head, but I will give it another chance. Perhaps there are better FW albums I should explore-I want to give them the benefit of the doubt after the glowing things I've read about them..."
4,Good Information,"I agree that her delivery of the information can be a little silly or goofy, but this DVD is worth buying. It contains alot of good information. My husband and I did not want to go to child birth classes. Instead we bought and watched this DVD. It saved us time and money! It also allowed us to learn at our own pace and in the comfort of our own home."
5,Great Video,"Although the woman who teaches you on this video is very opinionated, she does a great job teaching you everything you could imagine needing to know about child birth. After viewing this video I am much more educated on the topic and prepared for Labor and Delivery. I will defiantly loan this video out to any of my friends having a baby. And they didn't spend a ton of time on breathing techniques which tends to be a major focus of Lamaze classes. I defiantly feel more comfortable about trying a natural delivery."
1,Hard program to watch,"This dvd is very difficult to watch. The instructor is very annoying. Herinappropriate, unprofessional comments clearly make the couples in the class very uncomfortable. We were actually shocked by some of her poor attempts at humor. The entire program consists of this instructor lecturing to a small group of expectant couples, using outdated props and pointing to diagrams from old childbirth classes. You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth."
5,Great book for expectant parents,"My daughter and husband couldn't afford Lamaze classes, so I bought the book. It gave them a good foundation and they viewed the DVD several times it held so much information for them. It was a great purchase."
1,"Save your money . . . bad quality, not DVD worthy!","This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff."
2,Don't waste your money,"I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her."
3,Outdated and Not Funny,"Especially her antics with the forceps (not funny). There is some good information in here but fot the love of humans, I hope that this is not anyone's sole source of preparation. I feel she scares women too much and perhaps because she is a nurse, has the ""doctors are gods"" attitude. I would like to see a DVD by a midwife with a less medical attitude towards childbirth for those people who are not able for whatever reason to read books like ""Childbirth at Home"" by Marion Sousa or anything by Sheila Kitzinger.I'm sure some will disagree with me but as a veteran doula and homebirth advocate, these are my feelings."
5,First Time Mom in WI,"I loved this series. My husband and I watched it instead of attending the hospital class (which conflicted with our work schedules). It had us totally prepared for labor & delivery, and I highly recommend it."
2,Just ok,"The information is ok. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video. I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch."
3,Informative but annoying,"You may just love this lady, but I personally found her pretty annoying. But then again I wasn't real excited to be watching so many hours on the subject. It's informative, I would recommend it, but it could have been shortened without this lady's not-very-funny humor in my opinion. I would have preferred just the facts in a shorter version. The 2 DVDs are at least 3 hours altogether I believe."
1,Ruined my life..,"I'm an expected father to be, and I thought this DVD would help me show my caring compassionate side... I was trying to be part of the whole child birthing process. Thing is, this DVD provoked an unearthly rage in my spouse. While watching it Bayles seemed more intent on belittle the viewer and sharing her own life story then furnishing us with information. My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life.. The information she did give is easily obtainable from a free pamphlet. When I told my spouse I paid $[...] for the movie she freaked! [...]"
4,I only give it 4 as the sound quality was bad,"I don't know if it was just the DVD I got, but the sound quality was pretty bad on spots. May be because all 5 sections were squeezed onto one disc? That is my only complaint. It is very informative and we have watched it through once and will break it down into sections over the next couple of months. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't have time to get to a class. Again, my only complaint is sound quality."
4,Very Helpful,"My husband traveled for his job so, there was no way to schedule for Lamaze classes. The video was very helpful to him. I recommend this video for any couples who are unable to attend Lamaze classes together.The info was easy to understand and very convenient."
1,annoying instructor- waste of time,"I wish I could give this video 0 stars. Don't waste your money on this video. It's a 4 hour tirade of this woman trying to be funny. She is not funny. The actual INFORMATION in this video could have been condensed into an hour or less- if you cut out all her nonsense.You could learn more in an hour of watching youtube videos and surfing- for free... and you won't have to endure this woman's awful personality and attempts at humor (numerous times SCREAMING into her microphone.) Also, the footage appears to be from the mid 1990's- very dated, it's like watching a VHS recording. If you don't believe me go ahead and buy this- you'll see."
4,very informative,"I bought this DVD because I didn't want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. I found this to be just what I needed. The instructor gives a lot of good information is a pretty compact amount of time. I like the fact that I can go back and review parts of it whenever I want. I did not find the audio quality, her sense of humor or her accent to be annoying or prohibitive to the learning process as some others seem to have."
4,Better than taking a class!,"This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!"
4,Very Good sessions,"To begin with, the only reason i didn't give this DVD 5 stars was because of the video and audio quality - it was not upto DVD standards, and looked like it had been converted from the video format into DVD.The reason why we bought this DVD was due to lack of time to attend an actual LAMAZE course. We had attended one for our first baby, so this was more like a refresher at our convenience.Having said that, i would like to say that the sessions were very informative, educative, and well paced.Sheri does tend to get a bit ""loud"" in some sessions, but overall she has done an excellent job of providing the necessary information and tips, and answers to questions, that all expectant mothers are looking for.Will recommend this to friends for sure."
5,Birthing Class,"This is real simple, broken down, realistic examples, spoken with expirience. My wife and I didn't have the time to register and physically go to a class, the dvd turned out to be a better method anyway, we watch it once a week leading up to our time!"
4,Great Video,"This is a good, very helpful video that made me feel a lot more informed about the birthing process."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price."
5,Must have for expectant moms and dads.,This DVD is perfect for expecting mothers and fathers. It tells you everything you need to know about child birth. Fathers will find it interesting too. I felt a lot more prepared and confident about having a baby after watching it.
3,Not for Educators- Good for Soon to be Parents,"Overall, it's a good video for soon to be parents. As a childbirth educatior, I was looking for something with more graphics and illustrations to sum up my discussions during my childbirth classes.A little too much talking and not enough demonstrations so I returned the video."
4,A lot of helpful information,"I had heard mixed reviews of the child birth classes at my hospital. So, the idea of spending 6 hours in a class that I wasn't even sure would be helpful wasn't appealing to me or my husband. I selected this DVD based on the other reviews. My husband and I have been watching it one section at a time, since each section is between 30 and 45 minutes. There is a lot of useful information, such as early signs of labor, the stages of labor, and alternatives to what she calls ""normal birth"". However, there is definitely a preaching tone about not using any type of medications during labor and even though she discusses them; she definitely makes her opinions known. Still, if you don't have a good child birth class available to you, this is better than nothing. Perhaps balance this with the bookThe Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancyby Vicki Iovine for a different point of view."
4,laugh and learn about childbirth,Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.
4,Human Touch Massage Chair HT125,"I've had my chair for a few weeks now. In general, I like it. But before you buy it, test it out. The channels for your calves are quite narrow. I doubt grown men could use this feature. Also be aware that on this model, massage functions stop at the upper neck and don't really do shoulders or neck. It's a little noisy as well... the leather squeaks while in use. Won't bother you, but might bother others! All that said though, I am enjoying it and it's my unwind before I go to sleep at night."
2,"WARNING: ARGENTO, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL",This film lacks all the elements that make Argento's movies great and fun to watch. There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project.
4,"intoxicating horror,talking pantings, asia goes crazy","this will make you wonder about killers souls,can they enter peoples bodys after they die, why do normal people suddenly go crazy, a killing spree ...!!! this movie goes there."
2,"Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Movie","Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5."
3,"Argento's thriller starts well, but then turns predictable.","The first half of Dario Argento's hypnotic thriller is on a par with some of his early giallo classics, but then it slips a notch, becoming a rather routine slasher/revenge movie that borrows heavily from Ms. 45 and Psycho. The viewer is forced to wait for the film to ackowledge what the genre savy will, no doubt, already know in its remaining hour. The ending is atypically gentle for an Argento outing, perhaps he's getting mellow in his old age. Ennio Morricone's score is suitably chilling, the soundtrack is worth seeking out."
3,Good for Killing Some Time..,"Haley Andromeda Harmony is neurotic! She is an extreme hypochondriac and worries about pretty much everything. I thought this book was decently written, but I really disliked Haley's friends, Kiki and Jules. Throughout the entire book, Haley kept complaining about how she couldn't stand them and how they were always making fun of her, and 10 pages later, she was friends with them again. Kiki actually ended up being a decent friend to Haley, but Jules wasn't at all! I just don't understand why a person would be friends with someone who didn't respect them or treat them kindly. However, Haley was an authentic teenage character (albeit an overanxious one). This book was also written in epistolary format, which I've always loved. Cute, fluffy read."
3,Not much on MegaMillions,I purchased this book thinking it would tell a lot on Mega Millions but found out otherwise. The book is mostly on Powerball.Didn't go into the book much so I can't comment on that. I have returned it already.
4,Apple travel plugs well made,"I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need."
4,Worked Great,"I traveled to London for several weeks, and was concerned about charging my laptop from all the mixed reviews I read online. The adapter worked great, and I didn't need a power converter. Granted, it is more expensive than other adapters, but for me I loved the ease of not having to worry if anything would happen to my computer."
3,"Less energy, less sarcasm","I was stunned by Mary Prankster's first CD, ""Blue Skies over Dundalk"". Her cynicism cut me to the bone.Regrettably, although pleasant, her new album ""Roulette Girl"" lacks the drive, the wit, and the drug-induced hallucinations of ""Blue Skies"". Only one song, ""Mata Hari"", approached the sheer energy of the first album, and even it struck me as a poorer, gentler ripoff of ""Sadie Hawkins Day"".In a way, this CD brought (gasp!) Gordon Lightfoot's career to my mind -- his early albums showed genius in his songwriting and lyrics, but he ran out of things to say long before he stopped producing new music, resulting in dull travesties such as ""Protocol"".If you don't have it already, buy ""Blue Skies over Dundalk"" first, and fall in love with it. Later, if you feel like it, this one will complete the set for the time being. With luck, she will find her muse again before her next CD."
2,Size way too big,"This shirt was labeled Large, but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL. Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, I had to pay more shipping charges to return. I won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping."
3,ok,Outstanding service Shop on line and you can save money.yes i would buy again.and again..no problemswould tell a friend
4,A very clear picture of the English language,I enjoyed reading this and brushing up on my grammar. I thing I whould have done better at school if I had this then.
3,Healthy for your language,"Easy to read, but i wish it provides more practical information. Definitely stays on my Kindle, so I could use it when needed"
5,Should Be Required in All of Public Education,"While this book is described by some as ""old"", and even by a few as ""boring"", it is a great and valuable reference for those who sincerely want to learn the correct way to use the English language. Granted the art of correct spelling, grammar, speech, and composition has largely (and most unfortunately) disappeared from our culture, but the most successful among us will be those who can properly and effectively compose and present our thoughts... verbally and on paper. Those who choose to be left behind in this facet of communication do so at their own risk.This is a free book, but worth its (published and printed) weight in gold."
1,I have not received the item,"I have not received the item that I bought. I amjust waiting for some extra days in order to send a claim or a complain.Rgrds,Xavier Arderiu"
4,solid and raw old skool trash with a difference,"From the openning shrieks of ""Voivooooooooodddd..."" to the distinctive odd-beat of closing ""Nuclear War"" this is a great recording. Maybe its just me but I hear some musical influences from Motorhead to vocal nods to Rob Halford in the mix...all wondrous stuff w/superb musicialship by the Players and well constructed songs with good hooks and distinctive rythms not all sounding...lots of variety and tempo. Powerful raw production cuts like a razor. Excellent."
5,I love the entire series,I'm surprised these aren't very well known. The music and songs are just interesting and leave me feeling uplifted. Also interesting in that they traditionally don't use any real words - just sounds that sound like they could be words.
2,What ever happened to Barbara Crampton?,"In Movieland, some people are just born for certain parts. This was a Jeffrey Combs/Barbara Crampton movie if there ever was one. All it lacked was Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. This was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination unless you are satisfied with the sexy blonde in the black underwear on the bed for a photo session. She was sexy but not sympathetic. The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad. So bad in fact, I immediately again watched Reanimator and From Beyond, both with Jeffrey and Barbara, then I watched Death Bed again...I hate to admit it...I might watch it a third time. Oh, and Joe Estavez...Talk about unintentionally hilarious!!!."
4,An actual comedy!,"What an enjoyable film! Funny from start to finish and full of little visual laughs. Leave it to the French (or British, or Italians) to be heartwarminly politically incorrect. Just go see it."
5,Bought them for breathing problems from Congestive Heart Failure,"This is a wonderful product, worth every penny. The foam density is just right. I bought two bed wedges so that my husband & I can be side-by-side at night, and together they fit our queen size waterbed perfectly. I had two sets of pillow cases made by a skilled seamstress for the wedges and the neck and lumbar pillows.We, too, find that our bodies ""creep"" downwards during the night. My Dad was an invalid in the '60s with a rented hospital bed at home (with the back raised to assist his breathing), and I recall that it was a problem for him, too. Whenever we went into his room, he would ask us to help pull him back up... I would like to hear from someone as to how we might overcome this.I would recommend the Prop-Up Pillow to everyone who has a CHF diagnosis."
5,Totally awsome!! simply the best!!,"There aren't enough words to describe this work of art, but I'll do my best with what I have. I was just amazed, to say the least, when I read the last page of Clan of the Cave Bear, with craving for more. The story line is simply magnificent and richly detailed. it's just something that keeps you on your seat. And reading the whole series, I still want more. I'm extremelly confident that the next bok will deliver the same kind of exitment the others did."
1,Tedious,"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
5,A total escape that I couldn't put down!,"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this book! I have an interest in anthropology, have always heard of it and have been almost embarrassed not to have read it! I bought it just to see what all the hype was about, but was quickly absorbed and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I rarely have time to read fictional novels, but I stayed awake four hours on a red-eye flight to finish it!The main characters and story are great, some parts are a little far-fetched and certain characters are exaggerated, but the overall story is captivating. It left me running to buy the second Earth Child book!"
3,A good yarn,"Not incredibly well written, but the research and effort is evident, and the world is fascinating. Could do without the graphic sex."
4,Extremely entertaining and educational,"This book was recommended to me by a former student of mine who is into survival skills and primitive living. Respecting his opinion, I picked up the book. Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The contrast and conflict introduced by having a young Cro-Magnon woman raised by Neandertals was a an excellent vehicle for the story. The author seems to have done her homework on the ice age as well. Although I don't know about her speculations on the nature of Neandertal society and their brain structure and function, they were fascinating. These people become such an integral part of the story that by the end of the book when you begin to realize that they, as a group, are going to pass away soon, it brings a poignant sadness. Well written, excellent characterization."
2,Prehistorical Meandering Story,"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."
4,"Fourth read, and still fun","I just read some of the 1-star reviews, and found that while I do agree with some of the objections, I still enjoyed the book on this, the fourth read.I agree with one person who points out the unbelievable regularity with which Ayla makes discoveries. However, I chose to overlook it and just enjoy the story. If you want accurate factual history, you may want to look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained, read the book.I am impressed by the amount of research Ms. Auel obviously did regarding herbal medicine. I understand that she did a lot of research and some of the incidents in the story portray a possible reason for some of the archaeological finds, such as the inclusion of certain unusual objects in a burial cairn.I enjoyed the book, and look forward to the release of the newest book, Land of the Painted Caves. Since it is always such a long time between books, I like to refresh my memory, and greatly enjoy so doing."
5,a classic,"What an incredible journey into prehistoric times! This book is so vivid, so moving, and has exquisite detail about Ayla's world- both her personal feelings and experiences and the civilization she finds herself in. Do not miss this book."
4,"At last, a new hardcover edition on the market!","Well, I don't think that I have to convince anyone that this is a good book and the beginning of a good series. I wanted, instead, to express my gratitude that there is a standard-size harcover edition of The Clan of the Cave Bear again to buy. The other three books in the series have remained in print for years, but I could never locate a hard copy of the first novel. A couple of years ago, they re-released the hardcover, but it was in a smaller format, so it didn't match the others.Now, there is the hardcover again, along with the sneak peek at the new novel!"
5,Couldn't put it down.,"Wonderful story. I bought this on my Kindle, and I enjoyed it so much I will be buying it from Amazon as a set.The contents of the book makes you appreciate where we all came from.Jean Auel writes so well, you feel as thoughyou are actually ""in"" the story."
5,Totally Amazing! All of them!,"I have read all 4 books in this series and I can't get enough. Jean Auel is a literary genius. I am an herbalist so all the medicine woman information keeps me in its grip with extreme facination. Im dying to read the fifth book. Ayla, your my hero! Lanita"
3,"Interesting, but not great literature","This has definitely become a cult classic. I really liked the book the first time around, and it is a compelling story, but it definitely has some flaws. One of the biggest is Auel's writing. Her story ideas are good, but the execution is not great. Oh, let's face it, she writes like a tenth grader. An imaginative tenth grader, to be sure, but a tenth grader just the same. With that in mind, the best audience for this book is the high school crowd. Ayla has that whole teen rebellion thing going. As I've gotten older, she keeps getting less sympathetic. Seriously, it almost seems like she goes out of her way to get into trouble, and that whole ""she was different, she couldn't help it"" line just sounds like an excuse for her lack of self-control. Just because one has the ability to break every rule of their society, doesn't mean one should, but she's smart,blonde and pretty, so we'll build a series around her.<sigh>"
3,"Fun read, but kind of boring","I should have expected this, but it was kind of out of date and got to be boring. However, I did enjoy it as a quick, light read."
4,A pleasure to read,"Most birding books are best perused, but Dennis's books are a pleasure to read cover to cover. Also, the illustrations are incredibly perfect and gorgeously detailed.Plenty of personally-acquired information here, including some tips for deterring squirrels and other pests."
4,I have got it! It is in good state,"I choose 4, because the book has some scuff, but it is ok! The cost is $0,01! I have got it in time!"
4,Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!,"Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. The CD package was broken.....Other than that, it was fun to play it as the children in my art class painted their own version of""Boogie Woogie Broadway"" by Mondrian.Art Specialist --- Las Vegas, Nevada"
5,"A powerful, moving film you can't stop watching....","even as it races towards its inevitable and forgone conclusion. This movie reached me in a place I didn't even know I had. Jesus Nebot's acting and directing ability should make him an international star. To me the two main characters in this drama are Pablo and Mrs. Knight, the bereaved mother (played by JAG's Susan Haskell in a gut-wrenching performance), forever connected to each other by an accidental tragedy with a cosmic resolution. This movie will stay with you."
4,Nice companion to 'Warplanes of the Third Reich',"There are quite a few books about this subject on the market, and I rate this one second best. Top of the market in my eyes is 'Warplanes of the Third Reich' by William Green (672 pages!), but this book can serve as a nice companion or indeed as a replacement if your budget is a bit tight. The main advantage this book has compared to William Green masterpiece is the colour artwork, which is sadly lacking in the Green book. The only thing in which the comparison falls out negative against Green is the amount of information about each individual plane, but there is more general information about the Luftwaffe in WW2 to make this up. Highly recommended indeed."
3,First Impression,"Good Graphics, Ok gameplay that might get better as you play the game more, but if you are looking relive the experience of Final Fantasy Tactics this game falls short. There is not as much tactical strategy here, the system seems more based on who is stronger or has the better weapon. I have only played a few chapters, but it hasent caught my interest yet. Perhpas it will become more involved as the game progresses. Rent and Try before you buy."
5,cool story,if your a fan of FE well you will like this shift from portable console to home console. its really great story and characters that are intresting. its easy gameplay and worth beating a few timez to get new characters that you actualg koll during story mode its really good and some intresting twists and plots r hidden. by the way just making this clear this game does NOT star Marth from Super Smash Bros. Melee.
1,???,This thing has about 3 poems in it. Terrible! Do NOT waste your time!!!!!!! Extra words extra words extra words
1,This should not be listed on Amazon,"This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."
2,No illustrations,"The Kindle version has no illustrations, and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses. The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It's free, but it's hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me."
2,Kindle version - lost formatting,"Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one."
4,Great source for info,This is a worthwhile purchase. Initially I hesitated buying it but the information is extremely helpful even for the most seasoned professional photographer. If you are starting out this is invaluable.
5,halloween book,we just love halloween and we like this book cause it has some very cool things to make and we like to add different things each year. plus it is a very fun way to get the whole family involved and have some fun and grow stronger. thanks
4,Thuvia,"As with the series of John Carter, I enjoyed Thuvia very much. They are all great books of science fiction"
4,Fun read,Burroughs is always worth the investment of a little time when you are in need a good escape from reality
2,Boring,"Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and ""Afternoon Speaker"" is it. It even gets a bit monotonous, but at least it's perky and interesting. Pretty much everything else on there puts me to sleep."
3,"Good musicians, but....","...I was pretty bored with it by the 8th or 9th song. The songs just kinda blend into each other. I do like the vocals though. I hear ""Reason to Live"" is better."
4,Those alien babes are pretty hot!,"This great-looking brunette comes to earth to experience our physical relationships, and she leaves having accomplished her mission. Some imaginative scenes --- the best were the girl-girl encounters (at least in my opinion!) I especially liked the ""performance art"" exhibit attended by our alien hottie, in which the decadent artsy babe running the show ""uses"" a sexy blonde bimbo as her ""canvas"". It may not really be art, but I like it!"
3,Sexy star who goes looking for earthly love.,"Bought movie because the cover was sexy and was being sold for 3.99. Best 4 bucks I've spent in a while. Sci-fi bufs should watch for a change of pace. The star is beautiful and spends a lot of time learning about what earth sex is all about, most of it with her in various sexy poses. A cool, sexy surprise."
5,Well Worth Watching,"Like the movies ""Titanic"" and ""The Great Escape"", This is a story taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved.It's WWI and the US has not yet entered the war. American volunteers are trained in France to fly and fight the war. They become the ""Lafayette Escadrille"". This movie covers their training, flying/fighting, squadron bonding and off duty time.This is no documentary. It is a gripping story of the Americans who flew for the French combined with excellent air combat sequences. Better in the Blu-Ray Disc version. It will leave you wanting to run it again and again. Good photography, good story, good sound/special effects, good characters, . . . can you tell I thoroughly enjoyed it? Be sure to watch the special features, see how the combat footage was filmed.Those who have seen ""The DaVinci Code"" will recognize Jean Reno as the squadron commander."
4,WWI movie review,"This was an excellent movie that followed historical facts, more or less, and had superb flight sequences (that I assumed were computerized.) There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages. The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual ""composite characters"" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a ""team,"" but this was better than most. I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I reserve those ratings for the truly outstanding movie that comes along rarely."
3,Its allright,The computer generated action were just that. The characters were so so. The best part I thought was at the end...
3,Can someone review the DVD and not the movie please?,"Come on folks, how good is the DVD??????, you know - the thing amazon is selling that you are supposed to be reviewing??!?!??!!??This is not netflix!"
2,Hollywood commercial film-making to the bone,"Every possible cliche is here. The sound track smashes you in the head all the time. GCI battles cuks the life out of the movie. I'd prefer to watch again 1966's ""The Blue Max"" thatn ""Flyboys"".However, what makes this fil going and even somewhat tender to watch are the performances. There's some eracl acting here by James Franco and Jean Reno and the supoorting cast, even if they all clearly know this is an extremely commercial and cliched movie."
3,iT'S OK BUT YOU MAY THINK OTHERWISE...,I like its timing and all but everything else it's to say...do you know or understand what I mean??????????? OK.
1,Save Your Money,"Complete Dreck. the first five minutes were pretty good but it went downhill rapidly after that. It has no redeeming social values: terrible acting, completely phony aerial scenes (reminded me of the first Star Wars battle), and inane dialogue.Wish I could say more but we turned this thing off after an hour of hoping ""it will get better won't it?"" It didn't......"
4,The critics don't get it,"For some reason, critics generally don't get this type of movie. Maybe they're too young. Maybe they have no affection for (or perhaps knowledge of) the genre war movies of the 40s. They want these movies to be ""meaningful"". They want them to ""resonate"".But movies like this are just fun, like the old Errol Flynn/Clark Gable/John Wayne movies. They are Saturday afternoon popcorn movies, and there aren't nearly enough of them. I didn't care how ""accurate"" the movie was. I had fun. I loved it. And the romance (no sex) occupied only a small part of it, as it should (unlike Pearl Harbor, which sank under the weight of it).4 stars out of 5 due to its being somewhat overlong. But it definitely should be seen at least once on the big screen.Old-fashioned, cliche-ridden, and predictable. But loads of fun. Highly recommended."
5,FLYBOYS,I enjoyed this movie as it was entertaining with a war era/love story theme. It hit pretty high marks on both of these targets. The cinematography was nice and the love story was good. If you are looking for newsreel stuff on World War l go to the history channel because this will not take care of you. First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there. To see Jennifer Decker get a role and nail it like she did makes this film a winner and a movie that will go in my personal collection. If you liked the movie Pearl Harbor you will really enjoy this film as well.
4,No cliches just a slice of history.,This isn't a great movie. It's a good movie. It's worth the time and money. I liked it for two reasons: It provided a look at an remarkable piece of history and gave the viewer a sense of how loss effected the new fliers. It's applicable today. I came back with another new distinction about life.
1,Crap.,"Incredibly uninteresting film with characters you don't care about, a nondescript and swelling music score that all but drowns out whatever mumbled diagloue there is, and a computer-game feel to the aerial sequences. Really tedious. If you want to watch a movie about aviators in World War I, watch ""The Dawn Patrol"" with Errol Flynn and David Niven."
5,A must read for any noir fan.,"The two volumns are a must read for any noir, mystery or detective story fan. The quality of both volumns is great: it's library quality. It only contains the more public stories and novels and essays. To find the ones Chandler did not want well known you have to look elsewhere (he cut them up and put them in the novels you see the this set). The only criticism I have is that the Notes and Chandler Time-line are both a little weak. There are lots of slang and arcane jargon of the 30s and 40s that should have been defined. Only a small number of entries are found. But, if you want to read the master, this is it. Just buy both volumns and then look for the ""lost stories"" of Chandler to fill in the gaps."
2,To waste time only.,"If, according to the editorial review, you either desire to lavish the director of this picture with affection or to slap him silly, I advocate the latter. An amateurish attempt to lend some ""hipper than thou"" gloss to a mediocre plotline. Even the actors themselves seem uninspired by the material. Pumping, excellent score thanks to Craig Armstrong lets you walk away from the film with some sensation of feeling; other than that, bland."
4,A Real Sleeper,"Sophomoric, in my mind, means manipulative - visually, verbally, and through the pacing and continuity. This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional. Lighting, continuity... all first rate."
1,Confused Fairy-World,"At page 250 of this fantasy/fairy-tale novel by a prestigious British author, the main character, 17-year old Joanna says, ""This is getting very confusing."" That about sums up this mixed-up, hard-to-follow book about the loss and reclamation of Fairyland. Perhaps, it was more understandable to Brits? I just didn't get it or feel wowed or caused to suspend my disbelief."
3,Great Music - But know what you're buying.,"First of all, let me say that I have no problem with the music on this CD. Every song on this CD--every single one--is 5 star material. However, the buyer should realize that this compilation CD has not one, but TWO mislabeled tracks. The track labeled ""Stardust"" is actually ""Yesterdays"" from the ""Clifford Brown With Strings"" album. Also, the track labeled, ""If I Love Again"" is, in reality, ""Gerkin For Perkin"" from ""Study in Brown"". This error is pure sloppiness on the part of Verve records, and is likely to confuse the uninitiated."
2,TeddyBears,"Okay...........I'll admit that The TeddyBears got a good hit in ""CobraStyle"".........however, someone out there please reference me back to a hit from the 60's or 70's that has the same beat and melody and a lot of organ and drums.Please...............it is driving me crazyTed in the Sanitarium Lobby"
3,not too bad......,"Ive seen lots worse than this. The story is good enough to make a movieabout it. Its only a movie, so i did not try to tie in too much logic to it and i ended up liking it. Creepy doctor with a chip on his shoulder dont like tourists and has personal plans for some of them.I enjoyed the scenery, the waterfalls, the forest...much better than amovie shot inside a studio.Bottom line, good for a viewing or two."
3,Not my usual cup of tea,"Not my usual cup of tea, but I did enjoy it. It's a bit messy, especially when the main reason we should be afraid or disgusted comes around.Of course it depends on where you line is for such movies."
2,2 stars for 2 scenes,"1 girl running off cliff and 1 girl still awake while being operated on (creepy).other than those scenes,its basically the son of hostel."
1,It's like watching the show LOST!,Is it just me or did I feel like I was watching a missing episode of the show Lost? Just kiddin but anyways I thought it was a lil like the show Lost a bit but this movie was horrible. Do not watch it!
1,suckfest,"if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring..."
3,Not bad. Not great.,"After seeing the trailer for Turistas, I was vert eager to see it. Its a little misleading because none of the action starts until an hour into the film. Even the action is not that satisfying. there are some good scenes involving the victims but not enough. Not as bloody or scary as Hostel, but it does have its good moments (particularly a scene on an operating table). Not a great horror film but just manages to support enough tension and gore to pass."
4,Good Video for 7 year old boys,"This movie was cute, but the best part of my experience was the service. I was trying to get this movie for my son's birthday on short notice. We took 6 boys to an NHL hockey game and they watched the movie on the long ride to the arena. They loved it. The seller expedited the order and was great about making sure it arrived on time!"
3,Just about Ray-dee for the world.....,"Considering I didn't like any of his other CD'S. I actually was suprisingly impressed with this album. A few hot tracks consist of ""melody"", ""anytime"", raydiation intro, what I need, and lets play house. However, on ""I wish"" he sounds like he is about to pass out because he is straining his voice so much. Overall I give this album a 7 out of 10- I feel he has talent its just taking a while to cultivate."
2,What happened to this man?,"I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom ""Moesha"" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Fast-forward to 2005, and I hear ""One Wish."" He whined and cried his way through the entire song.Although the songs are pretty good, his voice has just deteriorated some how. I'm not sure what happened."
2,He's not quite there yet...,"Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!"
1,WHY?,"Ray J is not a thug... This as well as his image is all a FRAUD. It's insufferable listening to all his whining. Even R. Kelly's presence on ""Quit Actin'"" and Mya on ""Sexy"" are not enough to save this garbage. Ray J take a hint and ""Quit Actin'"" yourself and while you are at it stop singing too."
3,Wishes really do come tru,"Ray J has FINALLY managed to blend in. His video was playin and I wasn't payin attention. It sounded aight, but didn't hold my attention. Thats great. Anytime Ray J can show his face without me laughing is great. I laughed at his last album. I laughed bout him and Kim. I laughed when I realized he was desperate enough to join the cast of Moesha. {Ah, good times those were} Ray J musta wished apon a shining star tho. Cause I {along with the rest o the world} took him seriously this time. 3 stars. Thats what it is. His album is like a mix between Marquis' {Naked} and Usher's {8701} album. Don't wanna call him copy, but thats whats he's goin for. {Hell I don't blame em. I'd do the same thing. Sing, dance, take my shirt off, call it a day} Me being a guy, I'd say he's just as good {but no better} than any other sex symboled artist.{They're all the same 2 me} Waitaminute, Usher can juke. .... Back to the drawing board Ray J"
1,Not as described,"Package says one size fits most queen...well what the heck is most queen because a 1x and a 3x are too different sizes, I am a 1x and this didn't fit over my curves."
2,Disappointing,"Ouch!! Major slip following first two releases which I love. Last two tracks (""Cade Voce"" and ""Words"")are almost noteworthy, but not quite! Save your money on this one unless your a collector. Oh well - maybe next time."
3,"Not what I hoped, but the best there is...","Again, I don't feel this game equals the previous effort of the Dreamcast version (I'm starting to regret trading that console in!). While the graphics are first rate and the franchise option is good and a must in my opinion, the gameplay isn't as flawless as NBA2K2. Shooting suffers from a timing drag not felt in the original, and the camera positioning hasn't been terribly improved. I keep hoping for every franchise to make a jump in seamlessness the way they do in graphics and price, but dissapointingly it's not done here. Still far better than it's competitors, not as surprising and flawless as the football sims."
2,"not that much of a heartache .,","When Evie Brand comes home from L.A.,an ex-model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of Wade Armstrong ,someone who's been in love with her since high school, someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it. This is the second book in the all-girl brands series it 's not as good,it does not hold you all the way through it only picks a little at the end and you can't feel a whole lot of empathy for the character.THE HEROINE IS JUST SELF CENTRED AND BORING AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT THE HERO SEE'S IN HER BESIDES THE FACT SHE IS A MODEL THE HERO DESERVED BETTER."
4,"No Holiday Cheer, But Great Read","This was a very good book. It follows the story of a grown up Tiny Tim, as he struggles in his adult life. The author does a wonderful job describing England and the time they live in. It is dark and a little disturbing, but a great read. I really enjoyed it."
4,Interesting but still not Dickens,"Tiny Tim grows up amid the slums of London. Interesting but not as satisfying as it could have been. There are also some slight anachronisms but I'll let you find them. I'm glad I read it, but it didn't stick in my mind as, let's say, ""Drood"" did."
2,not really a memorable story,"I read this book a couple of months ago and I cannot remember much about the book, it being totally forgetable. Mr. Timothy could be Mr. Fred. There wasn't much of a point to him being ""Tiny Tim"" - just a plain old story. A big disappointment."
3,I expected too much,"When I ordered the coloring book filled with stained glass patterns, I thought it would be a great collection to my stained glass workshop where I have literally hundreds of patterns of stained glass angels. I was looking for something to build a stained glass panel from and these so called patterns don't follow the basic concepts about the way glass naturally breaks. I realize it's a coloring book, but I did expect it to be a bit more realistic. It's not even that I can't modify the designs, but I was so disappointed because I'd wanted something special to build in honor of family members who have passed away."
5,Fabulous psychological drama!,"Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas are superb in this film, with a story that will have you guessing until the very end - and maybe thereafter!"
4,Good Deal,"Well builded, not too bright because it's only 3 leds but good enough for camping (my experience, setting up my tent in the night, for example) or ocasional hands free work in dark situations. You can adjust the direction of the light up and down. Excellent deal for the price, I did purchase more tan one."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"If you feel you are interested in reading this book I suggest you save your money and wait till you find it at a garge sale for a quarter. Then read it only when it's one of those days where you just can't find anything else to read.She claimed to have been a mountain climber before Everest, but yet she had to ask other people what she needed to purchase for that climb. I would think that a ""Mountain Climber"" would have known what to purchase as far as equipment needed.She talks of this Zen responsibility then turns around to inform the readers of how Sandy Pittman is having an affair going on in her tent, of how Anatoli Boukreev's girlfriend ""tip-toes"" each afternoon to his tent to spend the night with him. I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was ""tip-toeing"" to, with the ""sexy green underware"" she speaks of in her book. Hmm?The book has nothing to do with Mountain Climbing if that is what you are interested in."
1,Self-absorbed garbage,"Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. It consists mainly of diary excerpts and the author's commentaries on them. The only insights for the reader are into the mind of an enormously driven, self-indulgent, and self-absorbed person. Reading this book is a waste of time and money."
2,Stick with Krakauer!,"What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. Don't waste a nickel on this one."
4,ANOTHER FUN SUPER NINTENDO PINBALL GAME 7.5 OUT OF 10,"Pinball Dreams is another fun example of why pinball games on Super Nintendo rule. You get to choose from four stages: Ignition, Steel Wheel, Beat Box, and Nightmare; all of which are fun and challenging stages. All of the levels are uniquely designed and are actually pretty cool. The main problem is though trying to rack up points and the controls need to be tuned up to be more responsive. This game is difficult to get scores as high as hundreds of thousands, which can be a problem but overall doesn't make you notice. I might also add the music for the different stages are great as well, and keep you in the mood to play the game without ever really getting bored. If you like pinball video games the Super Nintendo is your best bet for good pinball games along with various other games because it's still freaking cool."
5,My 2 year old LOVES this!,My husband is a fire fighter and my 2 year old LOVES this dvd. My husband likes it too! Elmo takes a tour of a real fire station and plenty of other Sesame Street fun. If your toddler loves fire trucks and fire fighters he/she will love this.
2,"Grainy, CC only with WMP","This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. Most series DVDs allow a ""play all"" option when several episodes are on a platter, this does not.The appearance of the video is slightly grainy, with slight ghosting outlines.This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer's DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning. Amazon needs to make that distinction in the descriptions of the DVDs it sells. Hunkering over a computer display is not my preferred method of watching TV.On a positive note, the DVD carrier is the easiest I've been able to pop a disk out of."
3,pretty good show,I have gotten into this show and it is cheaper to buy them here than online so here we are! The acting and writing gets a B and certain charachters drive me nuts (Sara) but otherwise it is somewhat entertaining.
5,This is a fantastic show. There's really nothing like it.,"The Third Season of CSI continues the quality marked by the first and second season. As many have mentioned, the third season continues its in depth focus on crime scene forensics--including acquisition and anlaysis of evidence--and also focuses on the personal characteristics of the CSIs. The third season focuses on Ward comes to grips with a former ex-gang member he went to school with; Grissom meets Lady Heather again, deals with losing hearing; Sarah learns that guys use her; ... This is a fantastic show. There's really nothing like it."
1,Gotta Be There,"I love this show. It is very entertaining, informative and ""gotta be there"". I have 1-5 seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again."
4,The Ultimate Vanessa-Mae,"While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn't care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. In my opinion, Picante, Leyenda, Widescreen and Night Flight are the best works on this album and I really enjoy listening to them."
5,Excellent Practical Reference,"I wrote my Master's thesis on the movement of grasshoppers and almost wore this book out! It became my bible. While I was writing up, you'd always see me with it under my arm. It addresses all of the major movement models from an applied standpoint. The original papers are rarely useful if you wish to actually apply the model to your own research. This book is written more like a text than a review, but is still very thorough mathematically. If you're doing research on movement or are just interested in mathematical models in ecology, this book is a must have."
5,Great Comfort,These things are great! Helps relieve neck and shoulder pain and smells wonderful. Money well invested.
1,I must be on something,"I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened."
1,truly awful.,crispin glover completely ruins this movie. had a pretty good yet uninspired plot....but still decent enough to stick with...UNTIL about half way through and you seriously cant take him anymore....this movie could of been a ton of fun but ended up truly sucking.
2,Riddled With Errors,This book is sloppy and riddled with errors. Coverage of topics is uneven. The author delves into some subjects but tap dances around others. You don't need this book for the FRM. I don't recommend it.
3,Decent,Got this because I got hit in the nuts while playing softball. Worked out perfect for me the next time the player wanted to stop short at the bag.
5,Voivod take it to the next level.,"If you enjoyed ""Nothingface"", then you'll flip over ""Negatron."" Voivod have always been on the verge of something amazing. This is it. New vocalist/bassist Eric Forrest sounds like Snake used to in the old days. This is also Voivod's heaviest outting to date. If you like spaced-out psychotic metal, this is the band for you."
2,Voivod sounding like Exodus?,"I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
5,(No title).,"Alkan's two sets of Impromptus are anything but run-of-the-mill. Although pretty straight-forward, these character-filled pieces are very interesting, and filled with tang, reminding me of Grieg, Bartok, and Chopin. As Ronald Smith said, they're ""relaxed, uncomplicated pieces designed more for private enjoyment than public exposure."" Although not all, much of this music is very memorable, if not touching. Laurent Martin is a fine Alkan interpreter, and this disc only confirms that status. Very warmly recommended, although the sound in some places leaves something to be desired."
3,Basic yet effective,This book reads like a blue print for medicine ball works as it pertains to developing speed and strength. The exercises presented are the foundation of such work and hence are valuable to the beginner. Those looking for more advanced exercises and techniques will probably be disappointed. Conclusion: great for the beginner.
2,"Great story, no full color prints","I bought this book for my collection because it was advertised as containig ""twelve full color prints by Thomas Mackenzie"".Sadly, the Mackenzie prints are absent, they are, however, listed in the front of the book under ""illustrations"", complete with page numbers, just no wonderful Mackenzie prints.This is the ""River City Press 1978 reprint"""
4,"Concise, comprehensive primer on rose growing","This short (80 pages), very pictorial guidebook to rose growing manages to convey to the reader the rich, exciting history of rose growing and the vastness of the industry in present days. It tells about how rose groweres manipulated and expanded the species, but also provides the novice back yard gardener with an easy to follow guide to buying and caring for roses. Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all."
2,2 Stars For Persistence,"Often I feel some admiration for Stephen Pastel and the way he (and Aggie and Katrina) have stayed true to their course and vision with such dogged persistence. So dogged have they been that, having been reviled for years, they're actually more respected than they've ever been.It was with some regret however that I have to report that any admiration I might have evaporates whenever I actually HEAR The Pastels - to be replaced with a feeling of ""can't they find something better to do after all these years"".Now, don't get me wrong, as Pastels go this CD is a lot better than almost anything they've ever done before - still doesn't detract from the fact that this is music by indier-than-thou smug under-achievers made for a captive audience who are, if anything, even smugger. Some people, it seems, are content to stay in their little ghettoes.The lack of talent is excusable, the lack of ambition is not."
2,wireless Camera,This was a great camera for the two days that it worked. I don't know what happend to it. I came home from work on the second day and my screen was all fuzzy. It just stopped working.
2,does not work well,"1) both units require power. the camera does have a 9v adpt but not the receiver. 2) there is always a line of interferance on the monitor cause by noise. Not a good picture.3) Picture quality is not clear, grainy and dis-colored4) 1st range test was only about 50' from base which was located in my bedroom and the camera stopped transmitting in my drive way. I will test it outside later5) ther is no on board memory storage, so you'll have to set up a computer or something.good luck.."
5,MovieHistorian,"This is one of the best movies on organized crime available. It is along the lines of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Donnie Brasco"" although it takes place at a much earlier time in history. It is gritty and factual although artistic license is expected. The movie focuses on Joe Valachi who was the first of the Mafia informants and set the stage for others to follow. The movie gives explicit and factual information on the history of the American Mafia from the original ""bosses"" through the making of the syndicate on through the Vito Genovese regime. It is a must see for anyone interested in the history of organized crime from its very beginning on to the beginning of their decline."
3,Rusty Gold,"When compared to the Heartbreakers' 79 live album, or even 'Add Water and Stir' (the posthumous double live album from '91), this album isn't all that spectacular, regardless of what this other reviewer might believe. On top of that, the lack of any audience noise (if there even IS an audience) makes me believe this is actually a live 'studio' recording.The performance isn't less than entertaining, but even the 'In Cold Blood' album (which compiles several live tracks) is a much better attempt at a live album than this one. It's budget priced, but runs at under 40 minutes.Being a 'take the money and run' performance, notwithstanding, it's still better than a lot of crap that's currently out on the market, including subsequent NY Dolls bootlegs like 'Back in the U.S.A.'. But get the majority of his studio albums, and check this out if you think it's not enough.By no means should you start out with this one, though."
5,A story that just needs to be told.,A story of what could be. A story of what we thought was coming. A story of what still might be.I was supposed to read this is high school but did not. I wish I had. On the level of Catcher in the Rye or To Kill A Mockingbird this novel is thought provoking and never dull.
4,Depressing stuff,"Depressing stuff and quite emotional, considering that I have experienced some of this dismal world for 18 years (xUSSR). On the other hand it is very much up-to-date. People are getting brainwashed today. Yesterday, absolutely everybody believed in Global Warming and if you didn't you were an enemy. Then in a blink of an eye Global Warming mutated into Climate Change. Again, everybody believes in it. They don't understand it, but they believe in it. They don't question it. They no longer have an ability/brain power to do it. They blindly believe/trust someone who allegedly knows more. Some who have retained the ability to question are the enemies. How many scientist who dared to voice their disbelieve in Global Warming were booed down by their colleagues and had to quit?It is but one example.That's life, isn't it?"
5,Fantastic book!!!,"Every happy little socialist should read this book! Orwell takes socialism of his day to the extreme, but today his veiw is not too far away. What's the differance between Hillary Clinton and Big Brother? The mustache.---This book is an amazing picture of mankind and a warning to all the people who want to steal the freedom from the individual(socialist)."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"1984 by George Orwell, is the most BORING book I ever read for school. To me the plot was not interesting, the characters were useless and the time period .... Although the idea of the government controling everything is scary and most likely true it just didn't have any emotions to make it good. For a book to be good it needs to have emotions, and this book lacked them, and there was also no dialouge which to me is important.KNOT"
1,"""classic"" does NOT mean good!!!","If you havent been forced to read this book while in school, or hadnt had a chance to grab it at the library, run while you can. 1984 might have been scary 100 years ago, but not now. If you like reading about old people think they are beating the system by saving a PAPERWEIGHT, then by all means...The book has multiple plot holes as well. Beware the ""government runs the world unchallenged, but still needs to brainwash old people"" hole. Read something else instead... ANYTHING ELSE!"
4,Political Correctness Writ Large,"This is another must-read dystopia. I don't recommend it for children, however. It is quite frightening for anyone with an imagination. Avoid the Ministry of Love whatever you do! This book warns against the manipulation of people through twisting meaning truth=deception; love=destruction. Evil remains evil no matter what it is called, but evil is most dangerous when re-named."
3,1984 The Good and Bad,"Orwell was a genius at forseeing future trends. He was also ingeneious at crafting the protrait of totalitarian control while using material from the media and political journals as his paint medium. His ability to take ""spin"" to its final conclusion with the term ""Newspeak"" is truly prophetic. The book is a warning cry for western civilization as it progresses to larger systems of government, and away from individual responsibility.On a somewhat negative side, are the main character, Winston's, interactions with and perceptions of some females in his society. While musing on the obviously ""politically-correct"" feminist female of the day, the author, through Winston, steps away from most readers by expressing contempt through Winston's desire to ""ravage the woman and strangle her at the moment of climax."" There are other graphic and sometimes repulsive descriptions of sexual escapades of the main character."
3,Great condition,"The book was in perfect condition when I received it. It is an interesting read, but it was too long."
5,One of my favortie novels ever!,"This book had a profound effect on me. It showed me how all thought is subjective, and showed me the fear of a totalitarian society. If you ever have the time of day, please read this book. And remember, two and two makes five..."
3,1984 has come and gone...,"Orwell's ""1984"" is a classic piece of 20th century literature, no doubt. While I can see many things of which he speaks of in today's society (doublespeak, Big Brother, etc.), this book was not written as prophecy, as some might suggest. It should serve as a warning, nothing more.Instead, I'll say that I read it as required reading in a high-school literature class and found Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" to be a less heavy-handed approach to storytelling. I enjoyed ""1984"" only slightly more than the later film based upon the novel <yawn>."
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK,"i give this book one star i had to read it for class and i know it's suposed to be a ""classic"" but god itis awful. first of all its NOTHING like the future is probly going to turn out. second of all every one says the aurthor george orwell is so trippy and wierd but i think he's just trying to cover up for the fact that HE CAN'T WRITE. please george do us all a faver and stop writing books."
5,1984,"This is one of the most chilling books I have ever read because there is no escape and even Winston's dreams of the ""Golden Country"" are finally lost to him as Big Brother invades the last sanctuary--his mind and his soul."
3,Really weird and hard to follow,"I was so lost when I first started reading this book. Orwell uses all these made-up words to describe ordinary things, and I couldn't remember them half the time. The very beginning was weird, and I didn't really understand what was happening. If we hadn't talked about it in my english class, I would still probably have no clue what it was about. There's a lot of symbolism that's really easy to miss, so it'd probably be better to not attack this one on your own. Wait until your class reads it, or your book club, or even just a few friends. Just don't try to figure everything out by yourself. If you do understand the book when you're done, you'll see that it was actually pretty interesting, and neat that Orwell, when he wrote it in 1948, actually had such advanced thoughts. Some parts are a little violent, and I don't really think there would be a point for anyone who's not in high school or older to read this book."
4,A shocking book,"I think I recall reading this in highschool, but of course, did not realize it's value at the time. Upon reading it 20 years later, I was amazed! This was a very shocking book in that when it was written there was no way the author could have known what would have been invented or happening in our present time or in 1984. It reads like fiction, but we know it is reality. He sheds light on many events that are already in motion, even though government may not make it official to the public. This book is a warning of just how terrible life could be if we continue to be blinded by what we are told by the media; how truth is distorted by the deliverer and their masters and how humans will ultimately destroy themselves for the sake of power if allowed to do so. Of course history does repeat itself, I hope that will be proven incorrect."
4,What If?,"What if there was someone watching your every move? For Winston Smith, this was a reality. A radical political party, simply called the Party, had taken control of life in Oceania. Its citizens had no choice but to mindlessly follow the reign of terror. Winston and his lover, Julia, banded together to secretly revolt against the Party's authority. Orwell's 1984 is a disturbing warning, forcing people to examine the freedoms they take for granted. This book is a haunting shadow of what may have been. Although the novel was lengthy, it is interesting, thought-provoking, and worth the time. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy taking a closer look at themselves and their own society."
3,Important read for the times,Found this to be somewhat appropo for the times in which we live. A stark warning of things to come.
4,Awsome made up world type of book.,"I read 1984 for a book report. It is really interesting and doesn't make you bored. It is kind of disapointing in the end, but it is the most creative book i have ever read. Im 14 and i really enjoyed this book."
5,1984,This is an incredible book. I was very impressed with how well it is written and amazed that someone in the mid 40's was able to come up with such futuristic ideas and almost shocked at how much of it pertains to the realities of life. I loved every word of it and was almost sad that it was over.
5,"My ""1984"" Review","I think that the book ""1984"", written by George Orwell was a book that raised many questions. It was a book about a man fighting for his rights only to fine out he had to give in a bit. ""1984"" was a book that captured me into its story and I couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend this book to someone looking for a challenge and a well written book!"
1,Garbage and other phrases...,"Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ ""Big Brother"" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity..."
3,Too popular for propaganda,This book is propaganda and is still used as such. I see it as new wave literature not as our English teachers see it a comment on totalitarianism. If your going to argue about the Soviet Union with me in all seriousness I would expect you too have lived there not be someone like the author a British Intelligence Officer. Why read biased junk? Mind you I find the romance in this story to be good so rate it 3 stars. Did this book introduce me to torture? I think it might have.
5,Definitely one of the beast books that I have ever read.,"This book is skillfully written, intrusting, and entertaining. It is not a difficult read, but is not oversimplified in its language, and despite being written in 1949 the story and language do not seam dated (this, I consider it worth noting is the opinion of a high school student, who read this book voluntarily, rather than for school.) The books image of life in a society, that is an example of a communist society as it is most commonly perceived, though is certainly not a society that follows the equality based principals of communism (no 'communist' nation ever has). The story, in summery, is definitely worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 14. (Worth is that I read, and liked, Animal farm, though I do not consider it to be nearly so good a book as 1984. I would recommend that to anyone as young as 12, due to the simplicity of its language."
4,The Erich Fromm afterword is outdated,"This book is a classic, and should be read by everyone claiming to be literate.The good thing about this particular version is that it's relatively inexpensive, and doesn't have a lot of extra material.The bad part about this particular version is that the afterword, written by Erich Fromm in 1961, has been overtaken by events. Communism has been exposed as an unethical, immoral system, and I am offended by Fromm's suggestion of some kind of moral equivalence between capitalism and communism.There needs to be a new afterword, written sometime after the World Trade Center attacks. It would actually be nice to have two small afterwords, written by people on different sides of the political aisle."
5,Nineteen Eighty-Four,"George Orwell depicts a horrible totalitarian state that suppresses all opposition. In 1984 the world is divided into three parts, Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. These three parts are constantly at war. The charismatic figure of Big Brother stands in the forefront of the Party. It is a figure of mythical power. Winston Smith struggles against the Party, he rebels against Big Brother and the totalitarian regime. But his rebellion will result in his own destruction. We should bare in mind that this novel was published in 1949 and we so realise that Orwell's imaginary future world is a brilliant creation, his vision of brutalised and manipulated humanity is gripping and unfortunately still supremely relevant."
5,Greatest Book Ever,"Why are you even spending time to read reviews of this book. Any educated individual should read this masterpiece. What a book, what an ending, what does our future really hold?"
5,It will rock you!,"There should be no doubt Orwell's ""1984"" is the gold standard for dystopian novels. It's about a Totalitarian society that exists in the future from when it was originally published in 1949 (certainly in our future as well). It's popularly believed the inspiration for ""1984"" came from Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"", first published in 1924, and there are similarities. Also, the suggestion, by others, that it's the direction that current politics are leading the U.S. is no doubt contributing to the story's renewed popularity. No matter the reasons, this story is frightening and depressing, but also a testament to the survivability of the human spirit. Prepare yourself though, ""1984"" will, without question, provide you a terrifying glimpse in a world bereft of personal freedom.I'd forgo the foreword by Thomas Pynchon though. Read it, if you must, after you finish reading ""1984""."
5,One of the Greatest Novels of All Time,"""1984"" is recognized to be one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, and helped to expose the evil that is contained in totalitarianism. The only fear is that in a post cold war existence we may fail to remember the lessons Orwell taught us, and unexpectedly in our complacency we may allow that evil to rise again."
1,"Verisimilitude, people!","I say the book is unrealistic, but that's not what I mean. It's not that his characters couldn't exist. It's more a problem of verisimilitude -- that is, he states the problem, and THEN HE DEVIATES FROM IT! The populace in 1984 -- they're supposed to be much like his ""modern people"" of '48. But it's just too darn blatant to make it seem real. And why is good ol' ""common man"" Winston disbelieving? It's thoroughly improbable. I realize he was talking about communism, but communism was a great deal subtler than that. It's nowhere near the realistic depictions of the future by science-fiction writers, but because the science-fiction writers weren't respected, and Orwell was a Prominent Social Critic, look what we're stuck with -- the paranoid fevered dream of a madman masquerading as a prophet."
5,High school English teacher,"I am a second year high school English teacher and I just read this book for the first time because I loved Animal Farm and I am now trying to figure out a way to talk my district into including it in the curriculum.I am not a very political person (I don't even vote), but this is a very interesting read about a society that never existed, but is coming very close to emerging: a society in which someone is ALWAYS watching (think reality TV mixed with Bush's phone taps).If you have never read this book, do yourself a favor and pick it up."
2,Cleverly imaginative yet unbearingly boring,"As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on."
2,I've never thought about the affects of a book quite so much,"Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it."
2,School Book review,"I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used ""Newspeak,"" past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."
2,"Great story, poor Kindle rendition","Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it's an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the ""Kindle edition"" of this great novel. Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences. It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."
5,How can we have enthusiasm to grow if we see no wrong?,"BRAVO! This is my all-time favorite book. Its wonderfully intriguing and sophisticated plot sparks intelligent thought, reexamination of our society, and serves as a warning for our future. This book should be on the ""Human Required Reading List"" anyway becasue of the every day references to Big Brother and other common analogies. Be prepared to be amazed by the power of the mind!"
5,I love George Orwell,"I read this book 5 years ago for an English book report. I've never been able to forget it. It's the haunting account of Winston Smith, an employee of the Ministry of Truth who hasn't forgotten the past, and who wants to change the future.However, Big Brother is watching him. Try as he might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the government.Published in 1949 during the Cold War, Orwell puts a spin on communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold. I shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Oceania, even in the slighest bit.Highly recommended book for the whole world to read. Let's hope we never come to this."
4,"If you read it years ago, try listening this time...","This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did."
4,Hauntingly relevant,"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."
4,1984--Great book--bad ending.,"I recently chose to read this book as an assignment for my english class. I've always heard that it is such a great piece of literature, so naturally I wanted to experience it. At the beginning of the novel, I was taken in by the way Orwell starts describing Oceania. Then he goes into describe how the party uses telescreens to watch everything that is done by members of the party. These as long as many other elements of the story were very intriguing and are what kept me reading to the end. For the most part, I greatly enjoyed this book, but I would have been happier if the ending was different."
2,"Maybe Big Brother will hate me, but...","I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."
5,A Must Read for Literary Fiction Fans,"Amazing. The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read. Again and again."
2,1984,"I read this book back in the '60's and seeing the events unfolding with the election of Obama, I wanted to see how much of Orwell's prediction are coming to fruition...starting with the BIG SCREEN TV's and now ""drones"" being used over American air space...scary!The book itself is rather slow reading (haven't finished)written in the 1st person with attention to details so very good for the imaginative mind. Still curious as to the outcome as I forgot the ending. More when completed.Would I recommend this book? depends, but not for everyone...I liked reading ""The Help"" better with the character interactions..."
1,Book was not trimmed,The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
3,"Classic, but dull","I thought that 1984 was a pretty good book, except that I think it would have been better if I would have read it before 1984. The begining was dull and kind of boring, but I thought that ending was pretty good. I recomend it because it shows what could happen in the future if the government ever got a lot of power."

5,Absolute stunner,"Many people have already written down the plot of this movie. many people understood the plot of the movie. Many people didn't understand the plot of this movie.This is a hell of a ride. With every next scene you are scared what will be next. But you want, NO you need to see it. Isabella Huppert is amazing and probably has givin the performance of the year. All the acting in this movie is magnificent. Many of the american reviewers don't seem to understand the bigger picture, as if sexual violence is of a worse kind then plain killing with a gun and shooting people in the streets. Knowing how puritan USA is as a country I believe that many people have difficulties seeing al the layers in this movie. There are so many, watch it again and maybe you will see the true art in this film."
4,Prepare yourself,"I was originally attracted to this film because I am/was a pianist and I was interested to see a French take on a movie involving a musician.Wow... upon first viewing, I was quite shocked. There are some scenes in this movie that are downright disturbing. If you've seen any French film, you may know what to expect. If you haven't, this may not be the right film to start with. Ultimately, it was very well acted and well directed. The special features aren't enormous, but what is there is quite interesting, including an interview with Isabelle Huppert.It's hard to describe, really. If you're used to American film, you probably won't like it right away. Give it a chance. If you don't like it, that's fine."
3,Spending time with a tortured soul.,"I like dark movies. This movie. Is a dark movie. I may have given the review just 3 stars but it is only for the many, many questions I had at the end of the film. The one thing I have trouble understanding is the true reason of why the piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) is the way she is. You can say out of nowhere, oh she was molested or raped when she was young or something but the movie never ever shows any flashbacks or reveal any true thoughts or opinions of her nature from her own point of view. The good job done by this movie is making the viewer a 'voyeur' into this woman's situation as she struggles with a man and her own mother. Another good reason why I liked the film is because of the ending. I just remember feeling so cold and depressed from the ending becuase it was something that I did not expect to happen at all. Personally this movie gave me a jilt and if your into ever watching foreign films than I recommend The Piano Teacher."
3,"Interesting, but not ""the truth""...","Will this video reveal the truth behind the origins of Nazism? Of course not. The rise of the Nazis was the result of a complex and unique set of social and political factors, of which occultism and the workings of secret societies was but a small part. The existence and activities of the so-called Vril Society is based largely on conjecture, it's influence and significance largely a matter of (mis)interpretation. While certainly interesting to watch, needless to say such a production always has an ulterior motive: to make money. Conspiracy/alternative history, after all, has become a lucrative industry."
2,Doen't fit to DCR-PC55,"This battery, NP-FA70, is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder. It won't fit into the camcorder. The battery DCR-PC55 uses is the NP-FA50.The information about the battery is misleading. It states that NP-FA70 is compatible with DCR-55, which is not correct. This battery is thicker than NP-FA50 and does not fit into DCR-55's battery bay."
2,He isn't what I remember.,"The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD , there is very little of his solo piano music. Very little grand piano type music at all. Most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music. I was disapointed."
2,Unbelievable,"This is a politically-correct Broadway play set to film. It fails utterly. Guinness is badly miscast, looking about as Japanese as, say, Robert Morley. Rosalind Russell is barely plausible as a Jewish mother. The movie lacks wit, humor, sophistication, action, and suspense. It's basically a soap opera with lots of preaching about the brotherhood of man (oops, humankind). It's no surprise to me that the film has not been released on DVD. No one needs to waste time like that. Put this one in your Turkey book."
2,BUYERS BEWARE! BOOTLEG OFFERING,"This film has not been issued on DVD. This listing was created by a bootlegger, selling home-made copies."
5,Majority of One,"I love this movie!! It is very special to me! I was fascinated with this movie and with Japan from an early age! This movie was actually my introduction to Japan decades ago. Then I ended up majoring in Japanese in college and living in Japan. Now I am writing a review of this movie sitting in Kawasaki, Japan... A very sweet movie... with famous actors... not without its ""unpolitically correct"" moments, that were accepted decades ago, but nevertheless a very sweet movie that shows how people who care about one another don't think about language barriers or differences in nationality. Love Love Love it!!"
2,Somebody Gotta Put You Back Into Yo Place!,"This CD set is false advertising. On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value. And beware, for some of the tracks are not even Beatle-related, it's just music from that time period.And I'm a big Beatles fan. My favourite albums are the White Album & Abbey Road."
3,can't read with these,The prescription is fine for the glasses but they are too small of an area to work with. I have to move my head around in the lenses to see read anything. They are not for everyone. If they made the reader lenses larger they would get a 5 star but as they are now I can only give them a 3 star rating. If they have a good return policy to get what you need I would pay more for the right ones.
1,0 STARS: Total GARBAGE!!,"This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can't say enough about how sorry this movie is. ""Tower of Blood"" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash. This is total amateuristic rubbish and is not worth a penny!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,I purchased this item as I was going on a 3 hour trip home to see my parents. I plugged this in and waited almost 20min with a screaming baby and the formula was almost as cold as it was when I started. Huge waste of money!!!1
1,Didn't warm at all!!,"It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!"
2,A harlequin romance set a sex club,"I found this book to be rather silly. Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq."
3,"Slick, entertaining, ultimately conformist","The novel was kind of groundbreaking in its time in that it took subject matter (BDSM) that until that time had been completely hidden in more or less underground publications. It was written with commercial slickness, a quality that is sometimes off-putting in Rice's work. The characters are basically sympathetic. Ultimately, the novel is not as subversive as it would like to be taken for, suggesting that the characters will only be happy once they escape their alternative sexual practices. It doesn't give this impression unequivocally yet there is a linger whiff of conformism in this book despite the subject matter."
2,Only if you liked the Movie,"If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is ""doing him""."
2,Needs more to it.,"I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. ""Eden"" was better than Anne's "" Beauty"" novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from "" Interview with the Vampire""."
2,Trashy,"I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."
2,Not her best work.,"I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here."
2,some books suffer from abridgement,"The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also."
3,Great Book,"This is a great storybook, fosters the imagination of my little girls. Fantastic illustrations, great to linger on each page...Ordered a ""like new"" copy which was filled with scribbles. Kind of disappointing, but not that big of a deal."
1,The title gives it away,"A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Ataturk is the reason Turkish people have democracy, women's equality, and a secular government. Without this 'dictator' they would be still in the stone ages. The 'author' has NO understanding of the Turkish and Ottoman history."
3,"Good, but not chocolate bar good","ok, so I'm not going to bash, these are my first protein bars, ever, so I have nothing to compare it to. I was expecting the worse and I was pleasantly surprised. I will say that are are filling, and give me the protein I'd want from a health food bar. The chocolate taste: haven't quite put my finger on it. initially I thought raspberry or even acai...but now I'm thinking it's probably the flax seeds? it's not bad, it's just not a milk chocolate taste, that some of these other reviewers are claiming could rival candy bars. I didn't encounter an aftertaste others have described. It is dense, but is that bad or good for health bars? beats me. I just couldn't imagine having coffee or tea with these. Way too rich to be accompanied with anything other than water, maybe milk. I will definitely finish this box as I find at 3pm they are really helpful."
1,Wrong book,"wrong book sent. Customer service was poor and presented an extremely difficult procedure for correcting the problem. I was required to pay to send the book back, mailing back cost almost as the book itself. Even complying with this process did not ensure a replacement, but only that the order would be checked."
4,The similarities between the the book and our world are amaz,"I enjoyed the book very much and would definitly recomend it to others. It is very fast paced and the action starts right from the begining of the book. The plot is very interesting because of the similarities between Ray's world and ours. If you like futurist books or even books about our world, and science fiction, this is definitly a great book."
3,Time to cool off and drop a few degrees,"The book Fahrenheirt 451 was a book that could use a lot of work. The author talks about burning books. Now if burning books is the type of book you like to read about then this is the perfect book for you. While reading this book you will learn about censorship and how important it is in socity today. Guy Montag who was the main character has issues weather burning books is good or not, although he is one of the firemen who burns the books. The book kind of deals with a reality check for the communtiy which if you read the book find out it doesn't turn out to well."
4,Classic Bradbury,"One of the top 100 books of all time per ""readers,"" this little book was beyond prophetic. Bradbury's writing creates a world that the reader easily accepts as real. This kindle version had a few distracting typo's - hence the 4 star rating."
4,rays story,"well in gerneral I think that Is a good story and it is hard to understand. Im not a bright guy but it was hard for me to understand, but the parts that I did I liked it. It could have had a better ending."
4,appreciation,"The author of the book Fahrenheit 451 was focused on teaching appreciation of God-given rights to his readers. Ray Bradbury considered a life without reading, without control of one's own thoughts, and without knowing history. He also considered a life where parents don't like the children that they have. Bradbury considered this and thought best to write a book so that people would not take their lives for granted. He considers reading a privilege, while most others would consider it a right, a right that isn't thought of as a right, but just is. Bradbury conveys a horrible story that helps his readers understand what they should value in life."
2,ATTENTION TEACHERS!,"I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of ""show, don't tell""? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School. It's no wonder, with book selections like these, that students don't read and are illiterate."
4,The Brain-Child of a Literary Lover,"Having met and seen Mr. Bradbury speak in person in the very location where he wrote this book out on type-writer, the Powell Library at UCLA, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the message this novel conveys. Serving as a warning to the intellectual and knowledge seekers, Guy Montage's search for information and logic is heroic considering the political repression present in his society. One of the pre-eminent beacons promoting freedom of speach and the free exchange of information, this novel continues to serve as a guideline and reminder of the importance of the open exchange of ideas. In a society where many governments and religious regimes seek to curtail information flow, this is a message of the necessary pro-activeness and vigilance necessary to preserve the Alexandria library of modern civilization, the printed word."
5,best book ever,I love this book! i tried to read it when i was younger but couldnt understand it and when i read it all the way through a few years ago i feel in love. this book is so beautiful and hopeful even through all the darkness. Ray Bradbury is an amazing author and knows how to bring a story to life.
3,"It was um, thought prevoking","Fahrenheit 451 was a book that had a very good message. This book made me think about where our society could be heading. It made me realize how important books are and how awful it would be if it was illegal to read! The only bad thing about this book is that there were many metaphores. Becuase there were so many metaphores I didn't always know if certain things were really happening or if he was just using figurative language. Despite this, the book was very good and made me think very hard about how important books really are."
3,Finally getting 'round to it,"This is a book I had always meant to read - so when a 16 yr old I know had to read it for class I read it too. It's a quick, entertaining read. Nothing earth-shattering for adults, but I can see why it's recommended for high school (or even middle school) kids."
2,Disappointed,"Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I tried and just couldn't get through this book. Perhaps I needed a teacher to help me get the symbolism!"
3,Great little book,"The world the book depicts is so far from reality that it was a good distraction. I'm sure there were many times in the past, history could have taken a wrong turn & many many books could have been lost. I am certainly glad that didn't really happen. I had an experience once in which I checked out a book titled ""Paganism"". I was just curious. All throught the book someone had written in pen that whoever reads the book is working w/the devil. I thought, ""isn't that special"". someone ruined a perfectly good book because of their religious beliefs. I showed the book to the librarian and she said she would use white out to fix it or order another book on Paganism."
5,Frighteningly Prophetic,"Farenheit 451 tells about a future United States. Keep in mind, this was written some 40 years ago, but his predictions can be alarmingly accurate. Montag's society's obsession with t.v. is frighteningly prophetic, as is the obsession with dieting. Also, has anyone ever thought of the similarities between the recently popular laser-light shows and the White Clown show? I must say that the most frightening part of this novel is how everything begins to move faster and the thoughts of the individual are lost - something I see happening in today's society."
4,Thought provoking read,"Ray Bradbury's last published book is a great thought provoking fantasy. What if we lived in a world where books were considered dangerous contraband and firemen weren't hired to put out but to start fires? We're already starting to experience news in shorter segments and everything's being reduced to soundbites. Will our attention span start to deteriorate to the extent that it is normal to only be able to focus for a few short minutes?Guy Montag is one such fireman whose wife subconsciously tries to commit suicide, and who after meeting a young neighbor, Clarisse, starts to think and question the world in which he lives. When he starts to steal and hide books in the walls of his house, he meets an old professor with whom he tries to formulate a plan to change the ruling regime who instill the fear of books among the population. But someone knows about his secret and soon Guy is on the run as a fugitive."
3,It's Mediocre.,"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a mediocre quality book. It is rather easy to read (7th grade level) and is also easy to follow. The writing style is different because the culture is very different from anywhere today. The plot is also different due to books are banned in this world. This book is recommended to people who dislike books because this book shows the world without them, so those people may reconsider their opinions."
4,I want more,"I just finished Fahrenheit 451 and feel like I did when someone gave me a shareware version of a video game. I learned the moves, became someone addicted, cleared the third level and found that I needed a code to get the rest of the game. Only Ray didn't give away the code to 451!This is clearly a fantastic story, horribly well written. I have wish listed several more of his books for future reading. Unfortunately 451 is long enough that you suspend some of the caveats used when reading short stories. With a book this long, I want developed characters to be resolved. Several characters just go away, which left me lacking at the end. Sometimes this is intended, and strong. In this case, it seemed thoughtless and abrubt.Don't miss the afterword and coda at the end. Very nice additions."
4,Great book,This was a book I had read in high school and really enjoyed. I thought this would make a great addition to my library at home.
3,Realizing the Relevance in The Real World.,"This book foretells our future by describing advances in technology. The scary part is how close we are. The sea shell radio can be portrayed as teenagers and their headphones. Mildred and the gals might as well be the stereotypical women who are having a tough relationship week; the ones who watch chick flicks with a tub of ice cream all week end. If you are interested in seeing what people from the seventies though about the future then this book is a good fit. Also, if you are interested in the future and sci-fi this is also a good book because their are some inventions not yet invented that are mentioned. I was required to read this book for my 9th grade year and I probably won't be reading it again because its just not one of those books. Not one of those books with descriptive features you might miss and want to read again for, or characters you can adore, or even events you would be on the edge of your seat to read."
1,All books begin with a premise...,"... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood."
3,later delivery than usual,I was in a hurry to get this book for a class project for my daughter. Ordered it and waited and waited for its arrival. Much longer shipping time than other books I had ordered on internet... I checked the book out of the library and read it while waiting.
5,Excellent story that portrays the affect that censorship and brainwashing can have on society,"Beautifully written, Fahrenheit 451 is set in an era where firemen create fires to burn forbidden books; books are after all evil. Guy Montag questions everything he has known, challenges the status quo and the result is an excellent story that portrays the affect that censorship and brainwashing can have on society."
3,A good book to get into and think!,"This book really makes you think and most of the things that are in this book about teens and technology is coming true in our world today, kinda scary."
2,My Review,"This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book."
2,OK,The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
2,Sadly a disappointment,"Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did."
2,Overrated,"I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title."
3,Great concept,"The premises of Fahrenheit 451 are promising: the ever looming ""this-could-happen"" is enacted out in the form of Guy Montag and his little world where people desire only 4 screen televisions in their parlour, where advertising reigns supreme, etc. A vast majority of books are illegal because they inspire conflict (the Koran and the Bible, Wealth of Nations and The Communist Manifesto) with conflicting ideas. Who would want that? The human race might actually get somewhere.It's a fantastic concept, and should lead to a great book. However, I've read this three times and each time I get the same general feeling: this could have been so much better. So, read it, just for the sake of reading it, but don't expect a huge masterpiece."
5,a classic,When I first heard of the basic plot in which Firemen burn books rather than putting out fires I was a little skeptical. I was most definitely mistaken. This prophetic short story was engrossing. There is nothing I can say which hasn't been said before. Yes the underlying themes aren't so underlying but they are multilayered and provide a buffet of ideas to feast upon.
4,A good read,"I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing."
2,The message is good but...,"The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."
3,This book is a little too far out,"Not being a avid science fiction reader, I was not as fond of this book as many of my peers were. I thought this book seemed a little to ""far out"" compared to what I am used to in a book. Although I found this book somewhat akward, I do still find it an alright book and well written, that is why this book is awarded three stars."
2,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."
3,This book gave me a headache.,"The prose of this book confused me a great deal. That's why I had trouble understanding the plot. All of Ray Bradbury's books do that to me. And even though I'm only 13, I love to read. I read Watership Down in 1 day, and loved it. There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read. It's the language that confuses me. This book could have been good if the language had more clarity. It has an inventive, thought-provoking storyline. TV might actually be taking over our lives. It's true in the real world."

And even though I'm only 13, I love to read. I read Watership Down in 1 day, and loved it. There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read."
3,"Great message, but confusingly presented.","Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a meaningful tale ofthe consequences of removing opinion, choice, andconflict from our world. The message is a powerfulone that will provoke and frighten the reader. The""fantasy"" world created by Bradbury bears a strikingresemblance to our own. However, I was confused bythe loaded metaphors and symbolism. Some createdvivid pictures, but others did not make any sense. Itwas often difficult to distinguish between themetaphors and actual events happening in the story.I appreciate Bradbury's message, but I feel that I mayhave missed some important comparisons andclarificatons. I hope that you do not."
5,How could you give it less than five stars?,"When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was ""Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest."" Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."
4,Fahrenheit 451,This was a great book because it shows they world where you can not think on your own and decide on your own. Life would be different if there were no book and where the government thinks for you.
2,Read it only for school,"I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book."
2,"The book is very boring and in some parts,doesn't make sense","This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me."
3,Better than expected,I thought this book was pretty good but not the best book I have ever read. Some parts were really good and I couldn't put it down but there were to many parts that were really boring. This book was about a society that couldn't have books because they made to many people unhappy and it was said they were full of garbage. Firefighters started fires to get rid of books instead of getting fires out. This book was confusing at parts but it wasn't to bad. I wouldn't recommend this to people have a hard time reading confusing books because you won't be able to finish. All around this was a pretty good book and it is worth it to read.
3,Too simplistic.,"there were parts of this book I enjoyed, but overall it is not a classic piece of literature. He's way too heavy-handed in his treatment of the material. The writing is just average. A good example is when he returns to the firehouse the night his wife turns him in. they get a call and it turns out to be his own house. It was obvious from the beginning that they would be ending up at his house (I thought), but to describe it Bradbury writes: ""Why,"" said Montag slowly,""we've stopped in front of *my* house"". I can think of a hundred other ways to convey that information that would have been more subtle, more elegant, more surprising. Be he hit's us over the head. It's like bad TV. Cut to comercial..."
1,A Very Dark and Mysterious Book,"I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book."
5,my review,this book was awsome! the ideas and points brought up in this novel by bradbury reflects our own society today
2,What the heck?,"This movie is weird to say the least. Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?). I'd definately recommend renting this movie if possible before considering a purchase."
4,Could this really happen?,"A great read w/a uncomfortably plausible story line. Just the fact that children could be used as pauns by terrorism is terrorfying in itself. This book is well written and the characters well developed. Interesting twist throughout the book and a good, ending. Well worth the read and looking forward to more books from this writer."
5,Every senior should get this book!,Purchased this book for my high school senior daughter to help her write those dreaded college essays. Great info with lots of tips to get the ideas flowing for topics. Highly recommend!
2,ludwig,Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Was not bored for a minute. Why are we being offered the truncated version? Only 2 stars for this version which is very disappointing after having waited so long for a Region 1 release. Really a shame.
4,Not The Same Ol' Blues,"Mem's not leaving the blues behind. He's taking them somewhere else! And the blues need to be taken elsewhere. Mr. Shannon is the best thing that's ever happened to contemporary blues. He's left all the stale cliches behind and taken a fresh approach. Mem has an abundance of talent and intelligence and he puts it to good use writing fresh lyrics relevant to the times. He's also one hell of a guitar player! From the gorgeous nylon string solo (how many other blues guitarists play a classical guitar?) on The Lights Of Caracas, to the ultra funky and inventive playing on We Going, Mem sounds inspired! He plays with a beautiful clean tone which is refreshing to these ears. Mem doesn't just play blues guitar licks like many unimaginative players, he plays music. There is much to like on this release as well as all of Mem's cds. If you've grown tired of the same 'ol blues, pick up a Mem Shannon cd. You'll be revitalized!"
4,Cheap price good product,My parents use this and it's made by motorola. No issues with it what so ever
4,It's Inexpensive and it Works,"I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores...even discount stores...and I don't see any difference between the performance of these and the expensives ones."
4,Car adapter for Motorola Razr - ok with me,Not much to say about it. It works and that's all I care about. Well worth the couple bucks!
4,A GREAT GAME FOR ADVENTURE LOVERS!,"This game is full of action. The graphics are really cool! Through out the game you will meet enemies. When you find them you will have to fight them. You can choose to be any of these characters: Frodo,Samwise,Pippin,Gandalf,Legolas,Gimli and Aragorn. All of these characters have there own unique power. My favourite character is Legolas, he is so cool!!Attention all costomers this makes a great gift!!yours truly,your reviewer***"
2,battle weary,"This game is horrible. The battles are so... long, slow and unexciting. The scenery is cute, but alittle dark for GBA.Don't waste your money."
4,"Hey give it some credit, listen to me.","So far this game hasn't received any credit, well not much.To start off the graphics are good, and the sound is good too.I haven't seen one glitch yet, I'm sorry. The battles are some what slow, but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping items. If you find glitches, return your game! My game is fine, and I'm past Moria. You can switch your characters, that is a really cool option. But the osund goes away in battles sometimes, thats not so fun. I like to have energy in my battles, but the battles are slow. That's why this game got a 7 out of 10. O' and I'm 14 years old, I'm just not signed up with Amazon. Fun game for younger kids.GRAPHICS: 8 out of 10SOUND: 6 out of 10GAMEPLAY: 7 out of 10OVERALL: 7 out of 10"
4,Its amazing but difficult. (i need help),"Look, the game its amazing.In the old forest you must go always right to go to the tree,always left to go to a secret place,always down to go to a man,and always up to go to a house.But i'm in the mines of moria now and i need some help.I was in a door but i cant move and push start neither.If someone who did pass the mines of moria is reeding this , i need you to tell me how to pass the mines, please."
4,Horrible!,"Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!"
1,A Bad Video Game,"Don't buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Vivendi Univeral's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has too many glitches in it that cause it to freeze. So, therefore, it is imossible to beat this game becuase of the glitches. Skip this title and buy EA's ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" for the Game Boy Advance instead. Besides, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a boring game for the Game Boy Advance anyway."
2,Ok game,"This game is Ok. If you like slow paced games this is your game.The graphics are great but the gameplay is slow.You can play all of the fellowship but you have to get to Rivendel to get Gimli,Legolas,Borimer,and Gandalf."
2,Book is better than the movie,"I really liked the book, that is why I got this DVD. Big mistake. The acting is so bad, it reminds me of those cheesy after school specials where it seems like they just pulled people off the streets and said ""here's the script, do the best you can"". I have several of Mary Higgins Clark's DVDs. It is pretty much hit and miss as to whether or not the acting will be good or not. You're better off renting them."
5,Great movies for kids!,"I found this two boxed VHS set at Marshall's for 5.99, brand new, so the asking price here it way too high, but the movies are wonderful for both kids and parents alike. I have a three year old and he is crazy about Stuart Little. You can't go wrong with these films!"
1,Not what was pictured,Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. What I recieved has no outlining on lettering. Very hard to read. Very disappointed in product.
5,Cop movie.,"Most police flicks are told from the prospective of white police officers. This one is told from a different view. The prologue is very true and not often spoken about. Overall, a good movie."
3,Lacked subtitles,"The amazon ad suggested Colin Firth was in more of the movies -- but he's only in one.Biggest problem: no subtitles, and we find the Brits hard to understand.If it had subtitles, we'd rate it a 4 or 5 star."
2,Love british movies,"But I had already seen some of this movie on Netflix, and did not realize until I had purchased this movie"
3,disappointed,I am disappointed that there are no closed captions. My husband cannot watch these movies with me because he is hard of hearing.
3,great service,"Great service it really was; but the movies, oh not so good very slow and boring. I was disapointed and had hoped for better."
2,Inconsistent and not Family Friendly,"Be aware that while the best known of these is sweet PG rated film and one is listed as Dove approved, others are PG-13 & R rated and filled with nudity and crudity. A disappointment."
3,8 Acclaimed Films,I trusted British Cinema too much with this one.Actor's names will pull me. One forgettable onewas disturbing probably because of the immorality.
3,Problem to record Video in my camcorder,"I was able to record any video produced with Ulead Video or Adobe Premier using the IEEE 1394 port using another 1394 card I had installed.When I installed this new card, I removed my old 1394 card to use the new 1394 port included in the ati radeon 8500 dv card.Now I can capture video without problems, but, when I try to record video to my camcorder using Ulead Video or Adobe Premier, is not working.The answer from ATI support is that the firewire port (1394) is for input only."
2,Cute but OUCH!,"I buy Clarks for the comfort and instant wearability, but I was so disappointed with these! I wore them around the house for a couple of days, hoping I'd be able to break them in, but eventually the skin on the back of my ankle and the sides of my feet (where the little strap crosses over) was rubbed off and bleeding. I decided to return them. I'll buy Clarks shoes again, but these were not good!"
2,same,"Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. ""12th rising"", ""brimstone gate"", but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar. I can't really decipher between them. Most of the riffs aren't capturing. It is hard to find the cd Diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already I can tell you that cd is better than Vittra."
2,SQUEKY SPRINGS,In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.
3,Not for use with Multi-Media Cards,"I purchased this with my Kodak DX3215 camera (which I love) because the tech support staff at Amazon assured me that it would work with multi-media card too. It does not.So the good people at Amazon Customer Support (I love them) promptly sent me a return ticket for it. Pity, though. I had called tech support just so that Amazon could be spared the expense of just such an event.And guess what? It turns out that I don't even need a media reader at all, because that's what the DX3215's docking station does beautifully for me anyway.However, I do agree that you should buy this if your digital camera lacks its own docking base, because its a great time saver."
1,Snake Oil,"The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation, the media reader(UCS-200) did not pass the Windows Logo Testing. I immediately aborted the process. I went to the Simpletech web site for advice. SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated,"" just ignore Windows's warning and complete the setup process"".What a mistake I made, my operating system was degraded and became unstable. Until I'm able to recover from this misfortune, my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person. I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site, I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future."
3,Great games but very few,"All in all this disc offers everything an 80's aficionado would want. As a kid who grew up in the 80's i tend to lean towards arcade games that come from my generation. Its often hard to find a Galaga in good working order at the arcade so this purchase was a no brainer for me. However, there are some drawbacks. First of all there are too few games on here and the difference between each game is so minimal in some cases that its almost a crime (ie. Galaga and Galaxian). As a Galaga fan i was also disappointed by the timing on the laser fire. Its very slow and reminiscient of an early version of the game before the firing became more rapid. But in the end these gripes are rather shallow since for 20 dollars i was at least ensured a game console with a laser button that wouldnt get stuck in the fire position."
3,Classic action,It's a great game but I suggest you rent it unless you grew up with these games. The action will wear off fast and the game will become obsolete within a month tops. That's about a dollar a day. Is it worth it?
1,"If you are one of the 7 people who understand this book, please let me know","If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know.For years, I have asked: what is so great about Finnegans Wake. Even the experts have given me only fragments of answers.The truth is that Finnegans Wake is written by a genius for an audience of around 20 people.I always thought it was odd that James Joyce had to invent words. The English language is rich enough that he should not have found the need to invent gibberish.If you can honesty tell me what is so great about this book, I will change my rating of it. Until then, it gets one star, only because there is no zero star rating."
4,Oracular,"The best and truest use of Finnegans Wake is to practice the divination called ""bibliomancy"". In bibliomancy, you open a book to a randomly determined passage and peruse the selected text for insight into a question or problem so vexing that you've turned to divination for answers. Traditional books for this purpose are the Bible and Homer.The Bible and Homer are not ideal for this purpose the way Finnegans Wake is, though. With them, you're likely to light on something like a genealogy, a ship catalogue, or instructions for the curtains on the Tabernacle. But every page of Finnegans Wake is properly oracular, laden with obscure hints that might actually shed prophetic insight on the topic at hand. No other book is its equal for this purpose.And, of course, Finnegans Wake also has the advantage of being inerrant in all matters of fact clearly stated therein."
1,"Whoa, dude!","My tenth grade English teacher made us read this book and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up book like this? I couldn't get any of it. What's the plot and whose the hero? I'm just really frustrated and I'm not alone. Only the class bookworm got past page 10 and I bet that weenie didn't understand much either, even if she says she did. Too hard, dude!"
1,Contemptious,"The pretence here is to say that if you don't think its brilliant then the you must be a vacuous superficial fool. Its the same stunt as pulled by 'modern-art', whose lack of popularity and understanding among most people lends it a perverse exclusivity among irrational psuedo-intellectuals.No one 'understands' this book because there is nothing in it. Its not hard-going because it is so mentally challenging, its hard going because it is so uttlerly uninspiring. A dime pulp romance novel tells us more than this book can.If someone crafted your house with the same 'wondrous perception' as Joyce crafted this book, it would be rubble sunk in cement dust."
5,In Defense,"this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."
5,Bunny Hugging,"I didn't expect to like this book at all. I certainly didn't expect to fall in love with it but that is exactly what happened! I love this book! It is really funny and readable, in fact it's a page turner! It really is a lot of fun and as I already said it is funny on almost every page. I think of it as a long beautiful poem written in a dream language. I like it better than any other Joyce."
4,I wish I knew all the world languages to be able to read it!,"No, I haven't read it i have many times tried to but i simply can't. I have read and admired many other books by Joyce. However the words that I scarcely understand, sound to me like music. Riverum riverum..."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"FINNEGAN'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, ""As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die."" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: ""The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever."" John Lennon said, ""All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not."" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the ""truth"" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."
4,Question of thought,How would Nietzsche criticize Ramana Maharshi's philosophicaland ethical system of thought?
4,Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!,"Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity, he is fed up with christians, and the people who distort christianity. Nietzsche is not the antichrist, he is simply the Messenger in a greek tragedy. We are the antichrist.""In reality there has been ofnly one christian, and he died on the cross. The Evangel died on the cross. what was called 'Evangel' from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had lived""antichrist 39Five stars for Nietzsche, three for the lack of notes. Also, there are many times when Nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translation.ps I'm older than twelve."
2,"defective, very disappointed","This tabletop pocket chart arrived with a defect and I had to return it to get my money back. The inside of each clear plastic pocket was covered with an extra layer of cheap, tear-able, thin plastic. Several places it was torn, creating a messy obstructed view for any pictures or words I would put in the plastic pockets. This made the product unusable."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"I think every Christian should recieve a copy of this book directly after baptism! It has been so helpful in proving to me the value of the spiritual disciplines, as well as explaining each of them in great detail. It is practical and concise, and has really been a blessing, truly a must have."
2,The Other Side Of A Christian Classic,"Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"
5,Delightful,I am delighted to have read this book and will find delight in reading it again very soon. Recommended to all!
2,Not sure about veracity of the material,"The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society."
2,an awful card,"Good parts: installation was easy, im not a computer-type just an avg young person. Has many cool features, TV-out,dual moniter etc.Bad parts: my computer is 5 years old with a really crummy vid card, and i play a lot of online games with it. They usually run 20 or 30 frames per second, which is barable but i could do better. so i went to comp usa and the guy told me to get this one because it was plenty fast. I installed evrything properly but even after tweaking and adjusting to the max all i could get was 12 fps. This card was so useless i exchanged it for a PNY technologys Verto geforce 4 ti 4400 card, which rocks btw....rocks hard."
3,Decent But Not Great,"I have had this for a week. This is a decent passive laptop cooler for my 15.4"" laptop which I used to not be able to use on my lap because of how hot it got. The bumpers provide enough lift to allow my laptop's fan to work properly. I was surprised I had to attach the 3 bumpers myself. I almost accidentally threw them away. But I guess it was a smart idea so I can put the bumpers where my laptop needs them.What I don't like is that what this 'lapinator' is made out of is real cheap. Looks like it could deform or bend really easily. Gets scratched up too. And the bottom pads aren't too comfortable. They do the job, but again, cheap. Way too pricy for what it actually is. The mousitizer works well for my mouse. Though if I leave the mouse alone I have to be careful and have my lap really level or the mouse will slide off.Overall, it does the job, but should not cost anywhere near $40."
1,"Much, MUCH better available... I suggest you keep looking","I am not at all pleased with ""the Lapinator"" product. It is not rigid at all, the flimsy plastic top distorts from laptop heat, and it's not wide enough (and I have the larger one).[...] They are not terribly durable, lasting only about a year before suffering stress cracks, but they are great while they last!"
4,Great,"I bought the lapinator and Mousitizer after a lot of searching (and a few failed home builds) so I could comfortably watch movies, play games etc on my bed in Iraq. I wasn't expecting much but when the Lapinator finally arrived it became a must have for several people in my living area. It was light weight and the non-skid feet would allow you to prop the computer up a little without worrying about it falling over. Even after a marathon session of gaming on an off day my legs we're hot from the laptop and the feet allow a good bit of air flow to go under the computer so even my computer was cooler than expected.! My only complaint is the mouse part is rather flimsy and putting a lot of pressure can cause it to fall off and just using it causes it to slant downward.4/5"
1,I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.,"It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band's, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you're really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack."
3,"Martial is excellent, translation is sloppy","Firstly, let me say that I am not an expert in Latin, though I am certaintly able to read it, understand it, and also know a little about its literary techniques. One of the most grating errors I have found in this translation is the continual rhyming of its lines. Latin, being a language of often mutable word ending but even more amorphous word order, had no need to rhyme its verse, and therefore any translation, in English, that insists on rhyming for any purpose usually obfuscates the original meaning so much that it is, in of itself, a whole different poem.I have also seen the ommission of many names in the work, which I find unappealing. While I do enjoy that it is able to combine the original latin with the english translation, I would recommend searching for a similar book with a better translator: it will make the epigrams far more enjoyable."
5,Decent dashboard cover for the money,"This cover did not fit perfect, but it is good enough for my old camper van. Helps with the glare from the old metal dash and looks nice too."
1,"Worse than ""The Quest""","The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn't do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement."
3,Not Bad as You May Think But...,"Here in Japan, this film was given a limited theatrical release. in 2001. Before I see this movie, I knew this film went straight to video in US,so I didn't expect much fun from it. Frankly, the plot is a dull one; the situation is borrowed from the typical ""leginnaire"" films like Beau Geste, and there is nothing new nor original here. Well, and for fans of the previous films of the star, it must be disappointing because there is no bone- crunching action scenes. Still, it has good, authentic location, and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell. My favorite actor, Steven Berkoff, displays his over-the-top acting (though a bit overacting, you may think), and I find it very delightful, and Nicholas Farrell's subtle performance is giving some reason for not avoiding the video. Not a classic, but good one of the genre."
2,Boring Van Damme Movie,"Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out movie. He joins the French legion after he doesn't take a fall for a couple of gangsters. Ludicrous piece of film-making which never surfaces and grabs the audience's attention. Van Damme has never really made a good action movie and he needs to go down in history as one of the worst action stars to ever hit Hollywood."
1,No,"These products are a great idea in theory, but in reality the dog isn't able to pant like it needs to and it is very uncomfortable for them. Not a good idea."
4,Sizing is a little off,"I agree with the other reviewer about the sizing. 0 is supposed to be for a doxie size, but my Jack Russell/Pug (20lbs) mix can slip out of it when it's not set super tight. We have a min-pin mix, about 11lbs, and I worry if we order another 0 it will be too big. Honestly 0 should fit the smallest dog, not a 25 pounder! Still a good product despite the sizing issues and the cost is good compared to other's."
4,"Helped, but..","This product is really nice and it seemed to help out my 15 lbs chorkie, but she quickly learned how to get it off by putting her paw on the part that attaches to the collar. I think it would be fine if her muzzle was a bit longer- her is maybe 1-2 inches long so it came off quite a bit. Otherwise, it really helped with pulling and while it was on her face it made walking enjoyable. :)"
5,Flawless,"I have used the SimpleTech 128MB SmartMedia card with my Olympus D-520 camera. I have had no trouble with this card, and can store plenty of images (100 at the highest resolution, and about 750 at the lowest.) There is only one problem with this card: getting it out of it's package can give anyone a real headache."
3,good movie - poor blu-ray quality,"The movie was good plus different, but the blu-ray quality was no better than an upconverted dvd at best sees ya!"
3,Acceptable,"A fun addition to the Stargate mythos, but not much more than an elongated episode. I saw no reason for this to be a movie. It isn't a good buy for anyone except those collecting the entire series. Or fans of Ben Browder. He's dreamy!"
2,Seriously Disappointing,"The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing."
4,"Fun Alt-History storyline, great for the shelf... after watching a million times, of course","""Continuum"" is a to-be-expected episodic continuation of the SG-1 series. It doesn't fill in any gaps or danglers left from the series as did the DVD-only release for ""The Ark of Truth."" The quality and story is top-notch as always although it's more of a small-screen episode. The extra features certainly make it worth watching (Amanda Tapping and submarines... by way of e.g.), if not purchasing for a home library.The biggest thing about SG-1 is that it was such a compelling episodic piece that TV without it is bland... just as when the Star Trek serials were killed off by the bean counters, or BSG by it's regenerators... at least there's ""Stargate Atlantis"" for now... and the hopefully continuing DVD-only pieces like ""The Ark of Truth"" and ""Continuum."" If you like SciFi, ""Continuum"" is a collector or SG-1 fan's must-have."
2,"Continuum, can't compare to Ark","Couldn't get into this. Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (""2001"" or ""2010"") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price."
4,"Loved This one, but I hated the ""Ark Of Truth.""","Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake. If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast."
2,"A Decent Story, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down","I watched this movie hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. But it still lacked that typical SG-1 zing to it that leaves a philosophical thought or critical sequence in your head for days. This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally, may as well give this one a miss. Due to a seemingly crammed together and rushed storyline."
3,"Not bad, but a little rehashed.","It's not that Continuum is bad, it's just like you're watching a familiar, but much longer, episode that you've already seen.It's the SG-1 ""old reliable"" with time travel and parallel worlds. The exploration of Bahl's character is interesting, but doesn't really focus on the interesting questions. The movie sets up scenarios that aren't resolved to satisfaction. It's the usual, ""hey, let's create an alternate reality where we can kill off everyone or make a good guy into a bad guy, because it'll all get changed back at the end!""I have always enjoyed the SG-1 series. But, I had to watch this movie in two sittings, because it dragged so much. Stargate fans deserved a little better than this reheated left-over."
3,Did I get a bad DVD of Stargate Continuum,"I loved the story and thoroughly enjoyed the story. The one problem I had was the sound mix. The volume of the music and special effects was 4 times that of the voice tracks. When the music came on I couldn't hear the actors. If I turned up the volume to hear the actors, the music was hurting my ears. I had to ride the volume control all through the movie and turn on closed caption to get what the actors were saying. I hope no one else has the same problem."
4,StarGate: Continuum- Is this the End?,"I like the way this one turned out! Looks like they neatly and tidily wrapped up the G'ould saga and can now close out the series without loose ends, or have them move on to other enterprises like getting rid of those pesky Ori, once and for all!"
4,Could have been better.,"I still enjoyed the movie, but it could have been much better. It felt like the plot was just starting to build up then the movie was suddenly over."
5,Movie review: Stargate: Continuum,I really liked the movie. It cleared up a few of the story lines in the series.I would recommend the movie to any Stargate fan.
4,Sanyo Rice Cooker,"Really like this rice cooker - keeps cooked rice warm nicely, easy to use - nothing negative to report."
1,Difficult to clean,"I really liked this cooker until I tried to clean it. My old rice cooker had a separate lid and I never noticed this difference in my research. This one is fixed on. I wish I had read the review that said the same thing I am now saying and took note. It's impossible to clean around all the gaskets and time consuming to try. Major design flaw. Other than that, it does make great rice."
3,An average rice cooker,"I purchased this rice cooker to replace my 30 year old (yes, 30) National unit. It cooks rice well enough, no better or worse than my older one but at least it has the warming feature that my older one did not have. It also works very well as a steamer. However, there are two problems with this unit that are somewhat annoying. First, there is no ""on/off"" switch, so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top, plugged in. The second issue is that in my case, water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the ""dew collector"" on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall, it is not a bad unit, but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance"
2,Rice cooker,Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.
4,Gotta respect his consistency and focus!,"Each listener will decide if they like this release and which among the 3 Musiq releases they like best. Of all the neo-soul artists out in the last 5+ years, I probably have listened to Bilal, D'Angelo and Musiq most. However, I am especially impressed with Musiq's ability to crank out records every 2 years of solid to excellent quality. Many of the other neo-soulers seem to be struggling with doing this (I'm sure for various reasons - writer block; record company problems; etc). He reminds me of the time when Marvin, Steve, Aretha and others got product out every 1-2 years. And, today it's even harder since an entire album must consist of strong cuts, unlike the 60's when you could do a strong single or two plus fillers for the rest of the album (of course not to say there weren't many great 60's albums). Lots of respect to Musiq!"
5,Awesome if you have the skills to cut it.,I bought two of these. My husband measured and cut them with our table saw. They fit great and are really nice quality. Everyone asks where I got them.
4,Good Addition,"I like the game generally. It's nice to have a relaxing playable game like this in your collection.that said Pac-Man is just like Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, is just like Galaxian. Pole Position 1 and 2 BOTH ""are bad"".P>The best one here is Dig Dug and its ""arranged"" version.But why the heck did they have to make the screen so small?Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC(...)"
3,charm,Am only collecting these for the butterfly theme I am going for . Love the color though . yada yada
2,ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ,"Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."
5,original and creative,"This is one of the most original movies I have seen in quite some time. The idea of showing 3 different versions of what could have happened is very creative. Somewhat like ""Sliding Doors"" in that respect, it explores the notion that if something had happened just a little bit differently, everything following could have turned out a completely different way. The performances are very good, the filming style is great, the plot and all its twists are completely original, and the rapid-fire pacing ensures that you'll never get bored. Thoroughly entertaining and recommended!"
4,Just a few notes about the DVD commentary...,"The commentary by the director and Franka Potente (Lola) is entertaining but not so informative about the movie itself. They recalled many shooting details, but neglect to really talk about the movie in depth. Oh, they speak in perfect English, so don't worry about reading subtitles!"
5,one of my favorites,"This movie is unlike anything you've ever seen or will ever see again. Lola has 20 minutes to find 100,000 marks to save her boyfriend from the mob. The movie shows three different scenarios and how the smallest thing, such as tripping on the way down the stairs, can effect your entire life. Very cool. Its the only movie I've seen that I can say I notice something new each and every time I watch it. You will not be bored by this movie. Its one of the few movies I've ever seen that can combine action and suspense with an intelligent plot. A must see!!"
4,The reason to watch foreing movies.,"If you have seen Black Mask and Run Lola Run, then you will know where they got the ideas for The Matrix; and both movies were made before The Matrix. I rented the DVD and I'm going to buy both the CD Soundtrack and the movie!"
2,A waste of time & money,"I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted watching this style of German movie making.The use of cartoons takes much away from the story. I don't think I have patience to watch it againso I will probably trash it."
3,OK for a German Movie,"I am German, and this is the first German movie I have EVER seen in the theaters! It was also my last one, because it didn't live up to my expectations - even though critics reported it was the best German movie ever... Anyway, the best part of the moive are the first 2 minutes (the preface). The idea itself is quite exciting, but strictly speaking, the movie is just 30 minutes long, and is repeated over and over again with vario9us scenarios... it get's very boring after a couple of minutes. Only the theme keeps you interested. It is not an action film, it is no thriller, no horror, no satire, I don't know what it is, but I wouldn't go for this one."
4,very interesting,I bought the film as i enjoy foreign films (hollywoods handling of films is quite typical so foreign films add the something extra)- we saw this film as a family (with 2 teens) - i loved it but the kids groaned at times when they had to see the same scene repeated 3 times with difference. It was memorable and loved the direction and raciness
4,"Exciting, original and highly entertaining","I'd hesitate to call this a masterpiece but it's about as much fun as any movie I've seen in recent years. It's relentlessly thrilling to watch, fresh-looking, well-acted, and the soundtrack complements the adrenaline-charged action perfectly. Don't expect your life to change, just expect a great time."
3,An 82 minute music video,"With all the critics out there praising this movie from beginning to end, I just couldn't help but be a little curious. So I purchased it, hoping that it would at least live up to half the hype. Well, for all it's worth, Lola doesn't lack anything in the style department as promised. The critics weren't kidding when they said it had stunning visuals, a pulse pounding soundtrack, and a pace only a cheetah could catch up with. Unfortunately, it just plays out like an extended MTV music video. The plot starts off interesting and easy enough, but the twist and turns all end in such a predictable and almost rushed way. Almost like the director gave up on the last half of the movie. Sure, I like the whole ""cause and effect"" feel, but it could've been polished more. To keep it simple, Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed . Just be forwarned, it's not for everybody."
4,Good Artsy Film,"Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt auf Deutsch) is an artsy film that some people might not get when they first watch it. I know it didn't until I watched it a couple more times.It's a movie about what ifs and without giving the plot to the story, there are lots of repeating scenes of what would have happened if I had done this. It is an interesting film, and I would recommend watching it in the original German rather than the English dubbed version."
3,independent for the sake of being independent,"Run Lola Run. The first time I watched this flick (which is a in my own personal DVD collection) I wasn't blown away. There's allot of hype about the flick, how great the movie is, how mind blowing the music is, blah blah blah... and with the advice Flavor Flave gave us all about ""the hype"", I didn't believe it. Instead, I went out and bought it because I was curious. The plot? Girl runs to save boyfriend. That's it. It was like ""Groundhog Day"" on ecstasy. I'll give it credit for being original. I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details. I'll give it credit for energy, as it had a lot... but in the end, I was rather bored with the ending. It kind of fell off. The music, house music, which you can find in most new age independent films. Watch it in German with the subtitles, because the English dub is so over-acted, it makes it look ridiculous. You'll enjoy it more in German, as I did... the second time."
2,A bit overrated. . .,"Actually this isn't really even a movie, it's a really long music video. Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the ""alternate-scenario"" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point. Is there a point? Somebody please enlighten me."
5,European Film At It's Best,"Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation."
3,Good Online Store,Good Items Just Needs Some Work On The Details/Description Overall I Recommend Using The Site/App For Your Next Purchase You Might Save Time And Money
3,"Reliable, yet slower than Sony Memory stick","Hi, this memory stick gave me no problems so far, but if I had to get picky, there is a noticable delay when writing the pictures to the memory stick. I used this stick on a Sony DSC P8. After taking a picture, the LCD screen would turn black for about 3-4 seconds, and it is probably writing to the memory stick during that time. I did not have this problem with the included Sony memory stick or the 256 Sony brand memory stick I bought. Reliable, but if you find this delay annoying, buy Sony."
2,Two star because....,"I haven't used it yet!!! The plastic packaging is ridiculous, wasteful and HAZARDOUS as I just managed to cut myself trying to open it. Seriously, what a waste of resources. I can't imagine the energy and waste used just for the packaging. Why go through the effort of marketing and sitting around a conference room discussing how cool it would be to package a MEMORY STICK with razor sharp plastic with a neat colorful cardboard backround just so it can be thrown away to forever stay on the face of this earth to injure another person!!!? ah!! For a MEMORY STICK? Gimme a break!!"
5,Excellent soup to nuts investing book,"This book covers all the bases and provided lots of great insights and ideas. I actually read Eric Tyson's Mutual Fund for Dummies first which I also thought was excellent.Covers traditional investments as well as real estate and small business. Coverage of online resources and software also was strong. Highly, highly recommended"
1,Science lover,"This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords."
1,Direct fit my a$$,"After consulting the Walker website I purchased this direct fit product for my 03 Impala.This muffler is only 15"" long and does not compensate in any way for the factory 16"" muffler.I ended up with a total redneck rig installation. WTFFollow up: I talked to Walker customer service, who were very nice, and was able to get a proper installation. Apparently the product is only ""direct fit"" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated). To me ""direct fit"" means that it should attach to the OEM parts. Other than that the quality was fine."
5,This book is one of the best that i have read in my LIFE!,"This is a fabulous book! It captures the reader, whoever that lucky person is, so that it is nearly immpossible to put it down. With a great plot, and many exciting moments, i would give this book 6 stars if the ratings even went that high. Also, the books Pale Phinix & Dreadfull Sorry are great, along with all of her other books."
4,Good color reference matieral for model builders!,"Nice album of color images put together by a well known rail photographer.I met the photographer once at a ""Fall Festival"" at the railroad. Those were wonderful times when the railroad had four locomotives in steam at the same time. Anyway Mallory Hope Farrell was nice enough to sign my copy. I purchased it at the railroad on a prior trip. Mr Kovalchick,(the owner of the railroad) also signed my copy. So the book has added meaning to me now!If you are a model builder you won't be sorry you made this purchase!Some of the images were made in the 1950's before the Railroad shut down and was reborn as a Tourist Railroad/Museum. Very interesting to see what the ""Eastie"" looked like in the ""Common-Carrier"" days."
3,"Alright, but not the best.","Not bad, but not the best french language album from Celine. If you're an english speaking fan, you should skip this album and just buy the On Ne Change Pas which features hits from this album. The vocals on this album and in general her french albums are just as or sometimes more melodic than her english albums but the vocal strength of the performances are not as dynamic or powerful...but still good enough to buy the french albums for cheap."
1,Misleading Advertising,"Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only ""exotic"" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!"
5,Gotta love gossip girl!,Gossip Girl had another good season! Can't wait for the 4th season! If you like season 1 & 2 u will like this one too!! The finale was awesome..
1,Never received my item,"I waited weeks and weeks to get my order. They took my money and I still have received my item, money back, or feedback after emailing them nearly two weeks ago. I'm not ordering from them again."
2,Really Not Worth It,"There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, ""Of excellence,"" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."
3,"Old Technology, but good for old PCs","I got this as a replacement to use in a very old, custom PC, which uses an AGP graphics card and runs on an Athlon CPU. I like the All-In-Wonder cards because they have A/V-in and A/V-out connections built-in. This is very handy for transferring old VHS tapes to your PC or to a DVD. The card also has a TV tuner built in, butit is analog-only and no longer usable."
1,Terrible single,"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
2,Conventional Wisdom for Morons,"This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain."
5,Excellent drive,"... This drive SUPPORTS Mt. Rainier (UDF 1.02), Mt. Rainier is the next generation UDF packet writing technology and it is better than UDF 1.50 which most of us are using right now (if you use packet writing at all). Mt. Rainier UDF technology handles error correction at the firmware level by the drive instead of by the burning software such as InCD, DirectCD, DLA, InstantWrite. The initial format is only 2 mins instead of 45 mins in UDF 1.50.This drive is very quiet and this is a very rare for drives that run faster than 32x."
5,Excellent Classical Music,"This is definitely one of my favorite classical CDs of all times. The orchestral organization is superb. All the instruments come alive with each piece and you get to hear a lot of drums. Anyone who is new to classical music would love this CD by Bedrich Smetana who I think is really underrated in the world of classical music. I think his music is better than Mozart's by far. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
4,nakita's review,"i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it."
1,TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT,"I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Don't waste your time. Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game. IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also. Which I read after playing it. Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun. Save your MONEY!"
2,Pointless,"Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included."
3,Not as professional as I expected,"Finally a comprehensive book about the great Motoen artists from the ""Golden Age."" The A-Z format made it very easy to read, but the technical structure of the book seemed unprofessional and very computer generated. Sometimes graphics covered text completely. The photographs aren't exactly ""unseen"" as they are various. I expected less euphemisms and an accurate story. Some of it was very good, like info on David and Jimmy Ruffin's relationship with the Tempts and Motown, although you have to look around for it."
4,An Oldie but a Goodie,"This material has been out a long time -- since the 70's but it's still as relevant and as helpful as ever. In this workbook Dunnam lays out a theology of prayer, teaches several different prayer practices and lays out the groundwork for an ongoing small group. That's pretty good for a ten week course!"
5,The New A-Teens Single is out now!,"This cd is a great purchase for any A-Teens fan (and just for anyone else...) ! It has great remixes that are somewhat similar to the previous ""Halfway Around The World"" ones. In the other version of Sugar Rush there is another song. It's called ""Give It Up"". In almost all of the new singles they have included new songs. This is a must buy if you like the group's music.Ateens are sooooo cooooool and their new music is also great. Another great buy is Teen Spirit, which includes all of their Non-Abba-cover new songs."
1,Not scary at all!,"The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else."
3,"GREAT EFFECTS, NOTHING ELSE.","This effects-heavy movie sure lays it on visually and sonically -- at the expense of a storyline or such horror essentials as suspense, pacing, etc. Even in the included making-of documentary, they mention that in horror it's not necessarily what you see, but what you don't see ... unfortunately they don't take their own advice.There are a few genuinely scary moments, but the momentum is lost, and the viewer is left with the impression of having seen some cool CG effects, but there's no effective build-up to a climax. After a while, the effects overpower everything else.DVD sound and picture quality are great. I'd recommend renting this one, since I can't see why I'd want to watch it again."
1,Writer and director witoout souls,I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
5,the Haunting,An awesome movie! It keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat...Scary but realistic and ending was well worth watching the whole movie.
3,Not So Bad,"I didn't know what to expect with this DVD. I'd heard some bad reviews of this. However, it wasn't the totally awful movie some say. It is not your basic, horror (ie slasher) movie, it works more with suspense, and the plot unrolling to give you the whole store. (I admit, I haven't seen the original, but then again, I'm judging this only on it's own merit) While not the WOW WHAt a Great MOVIE experience I've had with some, it was entertaining for the afternoon. The effects were good, and there was the element of suspense in many scenes, instead of blood and guts. Buy it , rent it, love it hate, - As long as your not expecting the greatest horror movie ever, and just an afternoon of entertainment, you're fine. and no, it's Not Blair Witch (Oh THANK GOD it's not, now that was overhyped and a huge let down! )"
3,You've gotta appreciate the sets!,"It doesn't seem like many people enjoyed this flick, but it really wasn't that bad. The plot was a little lame, but the acting wasn't bad. If you are into castles and architecture, this is a ""must see."" The sets are phenomenal! The FX pretty awesome too. The best acting was from the two ladies, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones, everyone else plodded through. Watch it for the huge, gothic, breathtaking sets - you can't pull your eyes away. Fabulous."
5,"Scary,funny,with C.Zeta Jones and an extremely ugly ghost!!!","Finaly a good remake,its not as good as the original but still a must see with some breathtalking special-effects! Lilly Taylor in one of her best roles yet and a well acting Catherine make this picture an unbelievable one! It doesn fright you as much as the ""old Haunting"" because you see ""animated"" ghosts in the remake! In the original you dont see ghosts at all and thats much scarier! Its an intertaining movie which I saw about 12 times and I never get enough of it! A must see for every fan of the ghosthouse-stories! With some good Special Features!!! And an ugly, frog-looking-like ghost called ""Hugh Craine"""
1,The Haunting is just... bad.,"If you want a good haunted house flick, get something else... anything else. This film has a pretty set, but no character development, no suspense, no scares, and no point."
1,Two hours I'll never get back!,"When I heard they were remaking ""The Haunting,"" I was excited. I love the original movie. I thought that with the modern techniques we have, we could make a good movie better.I was wrong. Sitting through this stinker was torture. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that's similar to Shirley Jackson's novel and the original movie is the name. Want to do something fun? Go get a root canal. It would be a lot more fun than this movie."
2,"Boring, not scary",This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it.
4,I liked this movie,"I thought this movie was very good. Granted it is PG-13, but it had much more tense situations than that rating would bely. I loved the special effects. They were similar to 'The Mummy'. The fluid effects on the curtains and the face in the dust are astounding. I felt this movie did suffer from a lack-luster script but the effects increased its appeal. This was a good movie and is not one for your youngins. It is filled with scary moments."
2,Huge talents in a poor poor movie,"Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie."
2,About as scary as The Simpsons!,"I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!"
2,Try something else.,"I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there."
1,This movie stinks!,"This movie proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it's past.Like every movie made today it has tons of stupid special effects,no acting,and a lousyscript. I think of all the hard work Robert Wise did on the original film only to beflushed down the toliet by the no talent crap we have in hollywood today!"
4,Not that bad after all,"Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
1,"The only thing ""HAUNTING"" me is the money I wasted","a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving."
2,A very poorly done horror movie.,"A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
2,Mediocre horror movie,"I guess the special effects were OK.... Frankly, however, this was kinda a big disappointment - with fine actors like Neeson and Zeta-Jones you'd expect more. Rather give this one a skip and go watch the 'Scream' movies all over again....."
2,okay movie with a couple scary parts,"You might like it and you might not.i havent seen the 1960's version and i bet it's a whole lot better than this.it depends if your a ghost story fan.if you are,see this."
1,AWFUL!,"I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."
5,Great movie,This movie is one of my favorites. It's like a more modern version of Hell House. It's graphics are great just like movies made today. Suspenseful.
5,THE BEST FILM EVER.,"The Movie was awsome, I liked the Effects,the Loud sounds and the Location of the Movie which was filmed in the Harlaxton Manor in England. the story was good and the environment of the film was the best. a must see. dont't axpect to see super hero's or people with guns and action or the Matrix, cause its just a haunted house story of supernatural. Kind of like Stephen Kings-(the Shining). the next movie ive gotta see, is (The Haunting on Hill House)."
1,"Not frightening, not anything","There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student."
3,"Loved Owen Wilson, But That's All","When my dad said this movie was one of the boring films he had ever seen, I agreed with him. In fact, the only thing that kept me from leaving was taking one look at Owen Wilson and nearly falling off my chair. ( The man is gorgeous. And for all of you who don't agree with me, you can go and have your head eaten by a lion-headed flue:op) Then, I ended up watching it again with seven teenage girls who all wanted to own the house. ( The only way you could get me to stay there was if you gave me $1,000,000 and Owen to do with as I please >:P) In short, I gave the three stars for Owen being there, otherwise, the plot is lame and there are too many effects. Also, Liam Neeson had me wishing he would die.If you want me to recommend a good movie, go see "" Shanghai Noon"", a great film, with a cute story, and the even cuter Owen Wilson. I'm not going to say this film was awful, but it was pretty boring. That's all folks!"
5,A Haunting Thriller,"The ""Haunting"" (1999) was a thrilling masterpiece. It combined editing pace, lighting, incredible sound & cinematography to create a thrilling suspense film. The viewer can not help being drawn into the story of Nell, played by Taylor. While the script is weak in places, the directors make up for it with computer-generated effects and incredible sound effects that leave the viewer wondering what's around the next corner. The setting (the castle) provides an excellent adventure for all. As a kid, I used to wander through abandoned houses at night and get spooked. This brings the fantasy of wandering through an old castle to life. In my opinion, this is a MUST HAVE for any video/DVD library."
2,"Oh no,","It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either."
3,THE MOVIE THAT INSPIRED SCARY MOVIE 2,"THIS MOVIE DIDN'T SCARE ME HOWEVER , IT WAS STILL A GOOD STORIE .THE GOOD :1# THE STORIE2# IT SET3# THE PLOT4# LIAM NEESON & CATHERINE ZETA JONESTHE BAD :1# OWEN WILSON & LILI TAYLOR2# LILI SEEMED LIKE A WHINNY LITTLE B!TC# WHO DURING THE LAST BATTLE WITH CRANE , JUST SEEMED UNDER DRAMATIC AS SHE WAS BASICLY JUST TALKING DOWN TO IT LIKE CRANE WAS A CHILD !3# IT NEEDED MORE SCARY MOMENTS FOR IT TO BE A HORROR FILM .THE HIGH LIGHT FOR ME WAS WHEN WILSON WAS DECAPITATED ... HE'S NOT A BAD ACTOR , JUST A WRONG CHOICE FOR THIS FILM . HIS HUMOR WAS ALL WRONG FOR THIS MOVIE ."
2,in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts,"there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original"
4,Pretty scary-not so swift ending,"I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like ""Scream""). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of ""what will happen next?"". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme ""good vs evil""."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL","To say that this version of ""The Haunting"" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the book is obvious. To say that it lacks logic, coherence, character, and good directing is even more obvious. Unfortunately, the film is not aimed at the intellectual crowd who are fans of Jackson's book, or the classic horror fans of the original movie. Instead, the filmmakers (one of whom is, in this case, the gloriously misguided Steven Spielberg) have aimed the story at the video game/music video crowd, sacrificing every nuance and plot element to the whirlwind of uninteresting and unmotivated special effects. In a house where anything can happen, nothing is frightening when it finally does."
1,"ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM","Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) ""The Haunting"" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"
5,A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish,"Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."
2,Not great - doesn't cover SQLite 3.0,"This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information."
2,sound quality ??????,the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one
4,"Looks good, but not for mobile applications.","I was hoping this unit would work out as a transmitter/receiver in my race car. It is small, rugged, and runs on 12 volts. I contacted RF Link and they even sent me a unit to try out, along with their amplifier, so that definitely says good things about them. Unfortunately, it did not work at all for me. As soon as the car started moving the signal started coming and going and video quality, well, it looked great before the car started moving.Still, looks like a good system, just not if you plan to be moving it around."
1,Not as advertised,The listing states that it works at 1000' take away a 0 and it might work at 100'. Don't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room. if you need it in the same room that would be fine.
2,Asvab for Dummies,It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.
4,good book,I have not gotten through the book but so far so good. Its very informative. i cant complain about it.
4,Good,"Good test taking strategies. I was able to identify the areas I need to practice/focus more one. I took all the practice tests feel pretty confident taking the ASVAB. Good review over the areas of subject to study, however may need to do a little bit more research in some areas ie Science, Vocabulary."
2,LOTS OF ERRORS!!!,This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
3,Beginner Yogi ~ Over my Head,I aspire to get to the level depicted in this video. I'm a beginner yogi and eventually will grow into this video. Thanks.
2,Say what??!!,"Well, I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners. It is far too difficult, too long, too advanced, too fast, with far too little instruction. There are many better yoga DVDs out there. Yes, I surf. Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Athletes""? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it."
5,"Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide.","As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great."
3,Freaks Freaks Freaks,"""The Sinful Dwarf"" is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the ""shocking"" premiere). The lead actor, Torben Bille, is one the most recognized dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess, he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation.Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles. They are drugged and tied up and later abused by ""clients"" and/or sold into slavery. In between, Dwarf and his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers. The many sex scenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of the Residents. It's like an insane mix between ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" and ""Pink Flamingos"" with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind. Trash film mogul Harry Novak also backed ""Please Don't Eat My Mother"", ""Kiss Me Quick"" etc."
3,beware!!! at least one supplier sells vinyl.,"can't speak to the audio. the product description says CD single. the cart description adds LP record. before purchase, I attempted to contact supplier to no avail"
5,Clear and detailed Explanation makes it a good book,"I have not really read the famous books by Steven Kay or other popular books in this topic. So I do not claim to be the authority to compare this book with other ones.But i felt this book has fantastic explanation on the topic it claims to cover ( Detection and Estimation theory - D&E; ). Detection theory starts only in the fifth chapter and the first four chapters clearly build the fundamentals in probability and linear algebra among others that are relevant for D&E.; As the author introduces you the necessary concepts, he clearly tells you in what context those will be used in the topics that follow later. In my opinion the motivation to introduce a concept is very essential.D&E; concepts are explained very well too and has quite a lot of examples that explained well and they feature at the right time and right place"
4,Plenty of room for a reasonable price,I tried this compact flash with my Canon S40 camera and found that it was provided plenty of room for pictures. This card performed faster than the CF card provided by the camera. I'm very satisfied with it. I get about 220 shots on a 4 Meg medium resolution format. There is minimum lag time between pictures. I did find that having a CF card reader is a lot faster and loading and unloading pictures from the card.
2,Started out good..,"I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it."
5,"A sweeping, epic novel that touches the heart to its core!","The strength of One Hudred Years comes from its ability to effect your entire being. The simple, layered prose involves the reader in a fantastic journey through the life and times of a town and family. The story speaks to you, just as stories did when you were a child, bringing an incredible reality that is both graspable and surreal."
5,My all time favorite,I absolutely love this book and have read it more than once. The magic realism is great!! It reads like a fairy tale and makes the unbelievable become almost believable to the reader. The book follows a family through the generations. History constantly repeats itself and each generation is affected by the choices the previous generation has made.
3,Great Writing but a purely cerebral pleasure,"After reading half way into the book, I started to enjoy the author's methodology of writing. I have never read a book with such an unique and amazing way of linking things together from different space and time and putting it in a linear fashion. Unfortunately I cannot appretiate the story anymore than the average person can appretiate modern art. It is something only a few select intellectual connoisseur can appretiate. But one thing is how many of the people would actually give it 5 stars if they never knew anything about the Noble Prize or the Oprah book club etc?"
3,"Great writing, difficult to follow","I agree with others that this is a difficult read. I was honestly enjoying the book after the first couple of chapters, however. The writing is excellent, the story and its many twists intriguing. It all fell apart for me about halfway through when I realized I was no longer able to distinguish the characters and keep up with who was child of whom and who had died and how, etc. -- all critical to the continuing understanding of the story line. The author's choice to give the vast cast of characters very similar names was mind boggling. After a point, I simply could not -- without a fair amount of note-taking and diagramming I was not willing to do --keep up with all of the Aurelianos and Arcadios. Hats off to those who could finish it. I, unfortunately, could not."
1,A skilled rapist,"The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."
2,"All tell, no show","I read literary fiction, ""smart"" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."
1,one hundred years of futility,"This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic."
5,More real than history,"These 100 years in Macondo are some how more magically real than real history, and as mythical as the Bible. With 5 Arcadio's, and 22 Aurelianos, there is so much ""family history"" that the names become confusing ... but this helps create the feeling of dynasty, of repetition, and the inseparability of past, present and future. ... ""The first of line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants"". Colonel Aureliano Buendias endless melting and creating his gold fishes also highlights this cycle and the interplay of memory and forgetting.Full of sensuous smells as Melquiades' laboratory, tastes as Rebecca's mud, and delightful colors as Mauricio's yellow butterflies the book can be intoxicating. The interplay of reality, fantasy, and magic made for a remarkable read!"
3,"An impressive novel, but I just never got 'hooked'!","Well, this one took me nearly six months to finish! I kept putting it down to read other more 'gripping' books. While I appreciate this novel for its wonderful writing and memorable characters and I am impressed by the book itself, I just found that I was never really 'hooked' by the story. Perhaps it lost something in translation (although I don't think I'll be attempting to read it in Spanish anytime soon!), or maybe I just had trouble with the non-chronological ordering of events (I like my stories to be linear!). Overall, an impressive novel, and one that I appreciate for its originality and scope, but did not thoroughly enjoy."
3,interesting wordsmith,"starts interesting but stream of consciousness gets oldand range of players is limited.yes unique literature but not that satisfying.ANd thats what I felt.If I dont skim a book so I do drink in all its flavors, then that is a good novel.Do we write jsut for the literati? or anyman?TO whom are we trying to convey some of life?Do I need to repeat the same atmospehre over and over?Should I marvel in how they show stupidity or comic relief?"
5,Read one copy so many times it fell a part!,"This is a novel that takes you away from the world of today and the horrible problems you are saturated by on TV, newspapers, radios, etc. .... makes you know that a hard life is not without trials and problems but the horror seems less intense and families continue no matter what."
5,Oprahs may be the devil...,"But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont."
3,One Hundred Hours of Humid Reading,"This was not an easy read by any means. I forced myself to finish it. The writing is good to excellent, but the multi-generational Aurelianos are so convoluted and confusing. Luckily, Marquez reminds you of the characters', background so you aren't totally lost following all the threads. The imagery in many places is sublime, fascinating, dark, mystical, crazy. It almost reminds me of watching a Tim Burton movie ( I had just seen Big Fish) with much more detail and story weaving. Sometimes you don't know when reality starts and stops, but that is also the beauty of this story. So many characters were living in their minds and not in the present. The matriarchal strength in this story binds it all. You have to pay attention and not read this before going to bed. At the end, I had to brush off the cobwebs and scrape off the moss from myself. I was lucky the ants remained outside."
5,"lost in space, ideas, lost in our solitude","All I can think when I read this book is the human comedy(tragedy) that we are trying to play. The comedy of life, of our solitude that has its roots deeply inside our souls. This book is a mirror of the human soul and of our society. The image reflected is tragic, is the image of souls that fight to survive in this mix of love, hate, ignorance, geniality and pain that is commonly known as LIFE. Marquez is great and this book is the reason why Marquez is great. READ IT."
2,Tedious,"I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt ""cheesy"" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."
1,I just don't get it...,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
1,Would've taken me 100 years to read,"I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or ""difficult"" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."
1,ARRRRRRRGH,"I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
2,"I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....","I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me."
3,The end justified the read...,"I was recommended this book years ago by a close friend, who considered it the best book she had ever read in her life. When I finally broke down and bought a copy, it took me forever to finish this. I believe that this was due in part to Marquez's annoying and often-confusing habit of giving every male in this three-generational family a derivative of the same name. (The family tree at the beginning of the novel became a favorite resting nook for my baby finger.)But while lengthy, this novel was never boring, as the author's prose were always poetic, lyrical and interesting. However, I kept wondering where these characters were going. The last chapter wrapped everything up nicely for me, causing me to more closely consider the meanderings of the characters who I had lived with for the last month. It made sense. Tragic, lyrical and memorable, but not the greatest novel I have ever read."
3,sometimes boring,"I read this book many years ago (in Spanish) and even if it keeps your attention and has great images and colorful descriptions it gets a little too boring. YOu want to flip some pages and keep going. Usually people who want to sound very ""literate"" try to talk you into it... be aware, is not the ""flowing through the pages"" type of book. Some understanding of the culture behind the whole story would be a good idea even before purchasing the book."
4,Interesting,"An interesting book. Its a little confusing in its direction and scope though. Maybe not a must read, but pretty good overall. wwr@virginia.edu"
3,Boring and confusing,"After 100 pages of reading, I cannot keep any of the characters straight and this is only part of the reason I've decided not to finish this book.It seems a waste to spend time on a book that up to this point has done literally nothing except try and leech as much interest out of a dull story by interweaving numerous eccentric characters into a really boring tale that most keeps me wondering WHY is it facinating that every other page Rebeca eats dirt (pica?)? Why should I find it romantic that an adult male virgin has fallen in love with a prepubescent child? Yuck!"
2,uncannonized,"doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon. (shot from it?) there's no melody, as it were, in this text. (yes, it's more of a text--hence, chore--than a book). magic realism=jiggery-pokery. you don't care about the characters as it's incredibly difficult to visualize them--and then you find that scads of them have the same name. ontology recapitulates...nonsense. you want something fantastical, go to Angela Carter. this guy spawned Salman Rushdie's awful indulgent junk, man. (although i remember ""love in the time of cholera"" being an all right read. double-yucky!"
2,Colombian family values -- part II,"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?"
5,One of the best books ever written,"I believe it's necessary to have some background in Spanish, Spanish American literature and Gabriel Garcia Marquez to truly comprehend the magnificence of this book. After reading the entire Don Quijote de la Mancha in Spanish for a college course, I actually thanked God that I decided to major in Spanish. I read Cien Anos de Soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude) twenty years later and I had the same reaction. For me, it is the masterpiece of the twentieth century."
3,customer service is poor,I got the UCL-L model. The directions do not fit the product and what is on line also skip a few steps. Being very handy this was not an issue when installing my HP 42in. plasma to the mount. The price was 299.00 plus shipping. When I contacted custimer service at Omni mount they were at times rude and not one of them seemed to know the products features. A very uneasy and disapointing situation. Next time I will try Sanus but not sure if their product control would be much better. As it turned out the mount was better than the follow up I received from the Omni support staff.
5,This is a serious mount!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. I did a lot of research and selected this mount because of OmniMount's reputation for quality. This is a very sturdy mount. It connects to 2 studs with 6 large bolts. I have a 46"" plasma TV and it isn't going anywhere! The TV looks great when flush against the wall, but it looks even better when I pull out the TV and turn it to the right or left.I installed this by myself, but it's probably a 2 person job. The instructions are not well written but you'll figure it out. The cable management is OK. If you have a lot of wires you'll quickly run out of space."
4,Tough Mount,"This mount is great! I can swing the TV out to view it from different parts of my master bedroom. Mainly the TV is pushed up against the wall. But with little ease, you can move it to any position. You just grab the TV and swing it around. The mount holds all of the weight of the TV. So there is only a little resistance.There are only two BAD things I could think of...1. The TV does protrude from the wall quite a bit. From wall to the front of the TV is about 9 or 10 inches.2. It is rather difficult to angle the TV up and down. You actually have to unlock a spring component to do it."

5,Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar,"I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. I have tried a number of them in the last few weeks and they taste great and best of all, I am feeling much better.Thank you Ms. Napier! I will spread the word!"
5,Funnier than I could ever have imagined,"I wonder if Discworld fans ever feel like they are in on a big happy secret, that people who think ""fantasy"" genre novels are beneath them aren't entitled to know.I guess I used to be one of those naysayers. My inherent interest level in dragons and trolls is not that high. But ""Men at Arms,"" the first Pratchett novel I've ever read, is the funniest most entertaining read I've had in years, in ANY genre.My only problem now is that I want to go right out and read the other 20+ novels ASAP, but fear I will lose my job because I am reading them under my desk at the office, and lose my husband because I wake him up laughing so hard while reading in bed.BTW if you want a real treat, try this (or other Pratchetts) on audio CD/cassette/download. The fellow doing the reading (Nigel Planer?) is a riot. Plus, if you listen in your car on the way to work, you can keep your job and your spouse."
4,Not Bad,"I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud. Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears. I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, ""walkman"" style headphones, but they won't fit. Too big. Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud. Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord. Not a bad deal overall."
4,Lively Weekend Discussion,"When Strong Medicine first came out, I indicated to to my girl-friend that she might like it. Strong Medicine quickly became her favorite series. While I normally avoid spending time in front of the television, I made a point of sitting with my future wife on Sunday evenings to end the week with a provocative episode of Srong Medicine. We always seemed to have an inteligent and lively discussion on the issues presented. When the first year of episodes came out, I was pleased to order a copy for Valentine's day. My wife was thrilled and we both are looking forward to the release of the second season."
2,Slow going,Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.
2,Seasoned practitioners--don't bother,"This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
2,Designer Dependent,"This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)"
1,In-line Writing Style,"This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake."
2,Rather outdated Swedish,"I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resvÃ¤skan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
5,Narrative poetry at its best very comical,"Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily."
3,"Stories are good, but syntax is lacking","While the 'Tales' in this volume are no less amusing and relevant, I would have preferred for it to have been read in Middle English, maintaining the original flow and meter (which is not that hard to understand after hearing it for a while)."
2,Kindle version is very poorly edited,"The content - introductory notes, translation - is great. This is one of my favourite adaptations of the Canterbury Tales into modern English.The Kindle version, however, complete ruins the book. The printed version presents facing-page translation, which works great. The kindle version attempts to do that, having one 'page' after the other, not considering that due to the font-size adaptability, this doesn't work at all."
5,This translation has it all.,"I really like this translation of the Chaucer classic. I like the fact that while being a modern language translation, it still keeps the work in verse form. I like the demonstrated ease of reading, my kids in English class like it for that reason. The older translations are good as well, but I feel the this translation is one that will allow Chaucer, and his stories to live on forever in the minds of modern readers. David Wright deserves just credit for making this available to the general readership.I will not review any of the stories because I think it wise to read them yourself and understand the truly effective use of irony in English writing."
1,Why is Chaucer so great?,"Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least."
4,Great,"This is a good translation. Coghill has masterfully captured the essence of Chuacer. The tales never fail to amuse, enlgihten, and teach me about life. Note: Though this is poetry, there are NO line numbers."
2,insufficient to teach this tonal language,"this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced."
5,Beautiful but unbelievably sad,"This is a very good and moving film and, with it's sequel ""Manon des Sources"" is truely excellent. It is not necessary to watch the sequel to appreciate Jean de Florette, but you will have to watch this first to make any sense of the the characters' motivations in Manon.I just wanted to comment on the review that suggested that the film-maker's motivation in splitting the two parts was financial. Look closely - the sequel takes place some 10 years later and uses the same cast. The story had to be broken up to allow everyone - especially the child Manon - to age sufficiently to continue.These are a couple of amazing films."
2,"Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo","I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A. Heppenheimer's recent book may be the best general work on space."
5,Truth is more fascinating than fiction!,Charles Pellegrino is a born storyteller - and he's working with one of the most fascinating true stories of history. Who can resist that combination?
1,"This is ""The Comlete book of Dutch oven cooking""","Or this is catalouge book and nothing more.If some buy Lodge cast iron pot or pan,must have this book free of cost."
5,THE GREATEST FILM SCORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MOVIES,"THIS IS FANTASTIC SCORE FOR ANY KIND OF A MOVIE, NOT JUST A CHEESY JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE! THE SCORE FOR THIS MOVIE WAS NOT ON THE VERSION OF THE MOVIE THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE USA IN 1962. HAVING NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL, UNEDITED, JAPANESE VERSION OF THE MOVIE, I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS MOVIE SOUNDTRACK, IT INCLUDES EERIE, SCARY KIND OF MUSIC (YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE MONSTERS CREEPING UP ON YOU, RIGHT OUT OF THE OCEAN), TRADITIONAL JAPANESE PERCUSSION, POP MUSIC, CHANTING, A LITTLE TIN PAN ALLEY, BLUES, LOUNGE MUSIC, MILITARY MARCHES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS COMING NEXT. I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THE WHOLE THING............"
5,Pulitzer Prize Winner,"Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."
4,CHEESY BUT FUN,"THE SEARCHERS were one of five groups stamped as MERSEY BEAT groups during the BRITISH INVASION.Apart from THE BEATLES,easily the best group of the bunch,there were THE DAVE CLARK FIVE,GERRY AND THE PACEMAKERS,HERMAN'S HERMITS and THE SEARCHERS.All of those bands were essentially singles oriented.Notice how WHEN YOU WALK IN TO THE ROOM sounds like THE BEATLES I FEEL FINE.Still,some of their singles,all included here are part of the so called 1963-1966 era,and have that innocence that after 1967 will be lost forever.SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA LOVE AGAIN and EVERYBODY COME CLAP YOUR HANDS were probably their two best tunes.When THE SEARCHERS released SECONDHAND DEALER in 1967,the clean cut image went downhill, and JOHN WAYNE took his STETSON and shoot them all out,regaining the title of his most famous western."
1,buyer beware...this product and the company are a rip-off,"this is a terrible product from a company that should not be in business. the scooter never worked...their solution was to send me a couple of neew components nad have me install. when that did not work, they had me run test after test after test...to no avail. the scooter does not work to this day. i filed a complaint with amazon...amazon did a lousy job of investigating and determined that the warranty was expired (30 day warranty!). of course it expired...they took a week each time to respond to my requests for help. the warranty was half over by the time i got the scooter after ordering it. i am disputing the charge through my credit card company, hope that gets my money back. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, I BELIEVE YOU WILL EXPERIECE THE SAME THINK I DID.BUYER BEWARE!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!"
4,surprisingly good,"For those of you who watched the previews and think Coyote Ugly is a substitute for a soft-core porn movie, you'd be wrong. It's basically a ""chick-flick"" film where the heroine overcomes adversity (in Violet's case, shyness) to reach eventual success as a songwriter. The beautiful bartenders are thrown in there only to entice some of the male audience to come watch the film (they really are nice to look at). There's no skin shown, though there is quite a lot of ""exotic dancing"" in the movie. It's a rather cliche theme and you know how the movie will end half-way through watching it, but amazingly, you'll still find yourself enjoying the ending. Violet's adorably innocent face makes you care how she ends up, and the love scenes are touchingly sappy. Find yourself smiling after watching it."
3,Coyote Ugly,"A decent but disappointing flick. It disappoints because it is definitely not as advertised. From the commercials, you'd think you're going to see a movie about a bar with outrageous female bartenders. The movie is actually about Violet who moves from Jersey to New York to become a song writer. After a burglary, she's broke and gets a job at the bar Coyote Ugly. You get occasional glimpses at the girls dancing on the bar and flinging water, drinks, and ice on their customers. Other than Violet, the other women at the bar aren't featured. You learn nothing about them. And if you're a Tyra Banks fan, don't bother watching this movie. She's on screen about ten minutes. That's a generous estimate. Mostly the movie is about Violet's attempts to get her music heard. It's sweet but not unique. The DVD has deleted scenes. Probably only one of them should have been saved. I would have given it four stars if I hadn't been so disappointed."
4,Love this movie,We've watched this movie three times. It's very entertaining and will keep you interested. It's probably more for younger or middle age people with an open mind. We are in our 60's and really liked it. I don't think it's for kids under 10 years of age.
4,Greg's Review,I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
4,A decent movie after all....,"I bought this movie because of the unbeatable price for my psp. My husband and I both own the device (psp) and use it quite often while traveling. Coyote Ugly is a great ""girlie"" movie you can watch over and over again."
5,Exciting,"Entertaining comedy with Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia. The bashful Violet comes from the province to the turbulent New York, in order to realize, despite her terrible stage fright, her dream of a song writer. She finds support in the charming Kevin. She works in Coyote Ugly"", the most hip club in town. After lots of obstacles she faces her first performance."
1,Absolutely horrible!,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Cruel Intentions""). The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!"
2,Make it Stop!,"My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!"
5,Coyote Ugly,I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!
2,Pretty Girls with a thin plot,The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
4,A Great Sexy Movie!,"All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, ""Coyote Ugly"" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."
1,One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen,"I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing..."
4,"One of the best albums of the decade, easily.","I'll keep this short. Every song on 2.0 is good and most of them border on great or better. Its an album you can listen to from start to finish and not have to skip past filler. My only complaint is that the lyrics, after a while, are a bit unfulfilling. They are always interesting, but once in a while its like ""Say something meaningfull!"". Not that the songs are devoid of meaning, but its nice to hear a storyline or at least a continuation of the same thought throughout the song. This is especially apparent on ""When I Grow Up"". Anyhow, this is still a great album and I'm very thankfull that Garbage made it. By the way, Shirley is wonderfull and essential, but your confused if you dont think that its the whole band that makes it work. Shirley and the rest of them couldnt do what they do without each other."
5,This CD rules!,"I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like ""When I grow up"" and ""Special"" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."
2,Ditch the Producer,"Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. ""2.0"" is an overproduced, watered-down, record-label-spawned creation that's not worthy of the band. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the big-name producer and get back into a studio on your own, playing on your own. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums."
2,I was disappointed,"Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are."
5,Words can't explain it...,"This CD is soooo... GOOD!!! This is one of my favorite CDs. The songs are so BOMB!!:) I especially like ""Temptation Waits"", ""Sleep Together"", ""When I Grow"", and ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"". THE WHOLE CD IS GOOD!!! You will NEVER get tired of listening to this! I also recommend Garbage's 1995 CD, ""Garbage""."
5,Album of the Year,This is one of the best CDs of the year. Garbage does all different types of music well.
5,"one word ""HECTIC""",brilliant but some songs r really overplayed well i suppose that comes with fame (lol) :) hate the front cover though its just plain mean
2,Changed too much in too little time.,"The band tried to pioneer a little too much into dance and electronica too early. Though ""The Trick..."" was the only good song with their new sound, ""Hammering..."" and ""Sleep Together"" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of ""Special"" and ""The Trick..."" and go from there."
3,Disapointing follow up,"Garbage's first CD was one of the best to come out of the 90's. A brilliant amazing record. Version 2.0 is laboured and lacks any soul or human connection. Its better than 80% of music out there today, but it can't touch the first record. I hope this is a minor blip in what I'm sure is going to be an amazing body of work."
2,Paranoiac...,This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
5,Beware when buying this CD!!!,"I'd love to write a critical review of this CD, but sadly I've never heard this version. I've been trying unsuccessfully for more than a year to order it, and each time I've received the wrong CD: specifically, the Japanese import with extra track ""Push It-- Boom Boom Satellites Remix"" instead of extra tracks ""Lick The Pavement"" and ""Thirteen."" Apparently, there's a universal ISBN snafu surrounding these two imports.I thought ordering from one of Amazon Marketplace's vendors would be a better way to go, but I've just received another wrong CD from one of them and I'm so frustrated I could spit kittens.I'm sure the extra tracks are as good as the rest of the album we all got to hear in the States, so I gave the import 5 stars. But if you order it, be prepared for a long wait and a big hassle returning the incorrect CDs you receive. Good luck!"
4,Garbage's Live Performance Dwarfs Album,"I saw Garbage live recently. I already had ""Garbage"" and ""Version 2.0,"" and thought they were good, but a little weak. After seeing the band live I was thoroughly convinced that their talent is great. Garbage literally ROCKED! Shirley Manson tore the house down with her energy and gutsy vocals. The other members were as energetic and their sound reflected that energy. I only wish their sound came across so well on their albums."
5,best garbage ever,"version 2.0 is the best cd ever! they have great music, clean, upbeat, and you won't get sick listening to it over and over...this is the cd to listen to on the subways, it makes your trip go alot faster...and somehow takes your mind to somewhere else, especially the last half of the cd...i recommend this to anyone who's into that urban pop music...it's not too hardcore and not to mellow, great for one of those days when you just want to get out of the city or wherever you are.."
4,This Garbage doesn't stink.,"It sounds so simple -- write perfect little pop songs, then throw a bunch of sound effects, tape loops and squealing guitars over it. Simple it's not, but ""Version 2.0"" has perfected that formula. There are no less than six radio-ready singles off this album. And supervixen singer Shirley Manson has never sounded better ... or sexier."
5,AWESOME!,"Let's face it,Garbage's self-titled '95 alblum was increadable, but with Version 2.0 they have outdone themselves (and in my opinion they have also outdone most all of the other top bands out there.) V 2.0 is by far the best CD I own. So, for anyone who is a fan of unique lyrics and song stylings and the angry demeanor and personality of lead singer Shirley Manson, buy this alblum now. You won't be disappointed."

1,Lousy,"Jane Fonda way over-acts, and the direction and production values are just one step above made-for-television level."
5,Continuing enjoyment through the years,"This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. The tension of the times and the quality of acting combine to reflect Hellman's personal experience. I wanted to add it to my very select library of film, now available on DVD."
4,Point and Click Crime Solving!,"Right off the bat I'll confess that I am a fan of point and click games AND I'm a fan of crime solving games. So, from that, you can tell that this game was right up my alley.The graphics are a bit bland, and you WILL get stuck. You WILL end up talking to each person about each scrap of paper in your inventory. You WILL drag the cursor over each minute pixel looking for that one smear of oil or dried blood stain you need. But when that final cinematic plays and justice is wrought at your judicial hands, dang, it is all worth it.Also, the writing is actually really good. There's a lot of twists to the cases and I was intrigued by how they would turn out.If you have the patience, or if you're looking for some murders (and an arson or two) to solve, this is you cup of tea."
5,Yoga for Anyone,"The scenery is so enjoyable and the music is fantastic. Peggy shows us that we all can do yoga, regardless of fitness level. The exercises are great even if you don't surf as we all need to be flexible. As an Occupational Therapist, I am interested in safe yoga exercises, rather than celebrity exercises and Peggy delivers a safe viable option to increasing your range of motion.Surf Flex: Flexibility, Yoga, and Conditioning Exercises for Surfers"
2,Nothing especially helpful for surfing,"This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class."
5,Yoga for Surfers,"This is awesome!! (The kook below who didn't understand the video obviously didn't watch it -- yoga in wetsuits at Pipeline?!?) Anyway, it is a great program -- the first time I've seen yoga and surfing combined, and it is beautiful! Taylor and Rochelle rip! I've already felt looser and stronger in my surfing and yoga with this program. BUY THIS DVD and and see for yourself (and forget the dude who wants to do surf-yoga with Ali McGraw!)"
2,Biography of a Grissly by Seton,"I didn't realize that there was no illustrations in the book and Seton was a very fine illustrator, so why would you publish one of his books without the illustrations?"
5,Some good naval sea stories by a master!,It was a lucky crew that got this man for an officer!I can recommend this author and all of his books. Even if he was Navy.
1,great american spice company,"stay away from Great American Spice company. They don't answer their 888 number, local number or emails. They have been investigated by their state attorney general for not shipping items. They settled.If they don't care about their customers ask yourself why should you buy from them."
3,Good Service,"I got what I ordered quickly. Wasn't exactly what I needed for the test I took, but it was exactly what I ordered"
4,A standard reference,This book is a must for the bookshelves of treasure hunters and armchair dreamers. The history of lost gold and hidden treasures in the American Southwest is summarized here as well as it can be.
2,Read as fiction,You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
4,Detailed Survey of WWII Air War,"We all know the important role of the AAF in WWII, but most books and movies focus on the ground war. The battles in the sky, often involving thousands of aircraft, are hard to imagine in the day of precision bombing that requires but a tiny fraction of aircraft of the campaigns in WWII. From the creation of the AAF, to the horrors of air battles, to the targets destroyed, this book will fill in student of WWII and aviation with an important chapter of history that is unlikely ever to be repeated. Strategic bombing alone didn't win the war, but without it, the cost to the Allies would have been far greater."
4,Nice Experience.,"This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it's like having a front row seat. I'm glad I purchased this one."
1,Just because she couldn't do it,"Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone."
1,Piece of garbage!,"The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works? What about the author, was she not taking away from her children when she wrote this book? I guess it is easy to preach to common folks when you are successful and do not need to work. Preach it somewhere else!"
2,Failed expectations,"I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America"
5,Bought this as a gift and they are very pleased with it,I bought this for my sister and my brother-in-law for christmas and they love it. My sister has been making cookies just to have some to put in the cookie jar.
3,"Masterton's take on ""The Dreams in the Witch-House""","Masterton borrows characters from Lovecraft's short story, ""The Dreams In the Witch-House"", for this unmistakably Mastertonian novel. What I mean is that if you are a Lovecraft fan (and I am not as familiar with Lovecraft as I am with Masterton), don't expect this novel to be in Lovecraft's style. This is a Masterton novel, which means it is full of gory violence and gratuitous sex.Sometimes with Masterton, you have to enjoy the ride because you may not like the destination. I am giving this novel three stars because the ride was lots of fun. Masterton loves to come up with new ways to disgust you with gore and guts, and then titillate you with some sex. Meanwhile, he gives you a clue here and there about why strange things are happening but doesn't give it all away.But sometimes his endings go a bit haywire, and I think that's what happened here. So if you are a Masterton fan, enjoy the ride. If you are a Lovecraft fan, you've been warned."
1,blleeuurrgghhhh,"i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it's way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none."
3,Not his best work.....,"We saw Gary live and he was absolutely hilarious, so we wanted to buy his material. This DVD has so so quality and isn't his best material (as far as comedy). I would pass on this one and buy a more recent DVD."
4,gary owen,"I like this comedian, which is why I purchased. However, the item I received had no picture, just sound. He was funny without the picture."
3,It was ok but there movies are a little too young for me.,"OK this movie was really kinda cheesy, I'm 13 and feel that many of their movies are geered for 8 yearolds after watching them, this one was ok, because i felt i could relate to some of the parts, but all the same i still felt it was a little cheesy and young for me, so if your 8-12 you would probably like it, but I would never watch it again."
1,Too Typical,"You think that since these girls had done so many movies, they would have least done something more original than the ""twin"" switch. They would not have been as successful as they are if they were not born twins, but they should still be more creative. I did not like this movie, and the acting was not good at all. It was a huge disappointment."
3,Interesting......,"The first and only time I saw this was on Animal Planet during 'Woah Sunday!'. I'm sad to say watching Mo almost beat the special. But I only saw the last half of it or so, even less probaly. This was interesting, seeing what it might be like in a certain amount of million years from now. But this was nothing special either. The CGI was terrible, movies such as Jurassic Park had better, and that was over 10 years bbefore this was made! The names they gave the creatures were highly laughable at, and even thinking of the few names I remember(which are Flish, Giant land squid, and the other land squid) send me into a short giggle fit.Basiclly, this is nothing extreme. Maybe a buy, but I suggest waiting for it to come on 'Woah Sunday!' again so you can compare it to Mo's side show. Or rent it."
4,"It`s not really science, but it is entertaining","To say that this is not really science is an understatement. When you get right down to it, it`s just speculation. But when dealingwith the question of what path future evolution might follow, the wild guess speculations found in this film are probably asgood of wild guesses as any are.It`s not science or even what you could call a real documentary, but it is entertaining. And the critters discribed are by nomeans impossible. There is plenty of food for thought here. The critters and their environments are well thought out and possible,even if they are not probable.Trying to predict the future path of evolution is very much like trying to predict next weeks lottery numbers. Your guess will likelybe wrong, but your guess is likely no worse than anyone else`s guess."
3,Iffy science but pretty pictures,"This DVD set is very entertaining-- funny, I should say. The science is faulty, it's set on hypothesis only, rarely on scientific fact. I am a college student and me and my friend found multiple errors in scientific facts. The animals that evolved were too specialized in the present to have evolved so radically. The names are uncreative but hilarious.We did enjoy watching this, mostly for laughs and to feel intelligent. The graphics are rather nice though, and I applaud the creators of this ""documentary"" for that."
5,"Seems Crazy, but is Amazingly Sound","""The Future is Wild"" is based on scientific assumptions as to what will live on Earth in millions of years from now. This series is not as far-fetched as it seems. Scientists comment through the whole series and explain how and why these animals might evolve. Some of the theories seem insane like their idea that squid will take the place of humans as the dominant species on the planet, but the way the scientists explain these possibilities, the idea becomes understandable, and even possilble. ""The Future is Wild"" is a great series, but if you have a short attention span, I wouldn't watch it. I hope this review was helpful and I hope you enjoy ""The Future is Wild""!NOTE: Creationists SHOULD NOT watch!"
5,the future is wild,I bought this dvd for my son who has been wanting it since he saw it on TV. He loved it and has watched it many times since he got it.
4,Was Interesting,"My 6 year old wanted this series so I ordered it. We don't have cable so when we saw a little piece of this series at a pizza place, we thought, hey...looks interesting.My son enjoyed it and I did as well. I wouldn't have purchased this if I had seen it on cable, but my son has had fun sharing with others what the future may hold.It did fire up a discussion about traveling through time both past and future and my son has decided he will invent that machine just to really see what's up with the future. So from that standpoint it was fun and helped stir up quite a fun discussion and spark a 6 year old boy's imagine to go wild.If you don't like watching other things eat other things, you may want to keep the remote handy...other than that...it's worth a watch at least one time."
2,Buyer BEWARE,"This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase"
1,Use with caution!,"Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks."
1,nothing but errors in this book,"I agree completely with the other reviews of this book. I just spent an hour deriving and re-deriving the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. The previous review tells me what I need to know -- it is incorrect in this book!!! There are so many errors that it is actually more work to review material that I already know than it was to learn it the first time. It's a shame I can't give zero stars on this review."
1,Monkies on typewriters,"You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this book, I'd guess that Dr. Laberge employed 3 monkies for 10 minutes."
1,This book is the worst you could use for your GRE prep,"This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it."
1,Consider American Made Products,"Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office). We are going to chalk it up to what you get when you don't buy American."
2,Knock Off,I am upset to see that this is a knock off. How is it legal for them to sell this? I guess amazon does not care to protect it's buyers...
4,simple fun,Both my 4-year-old and 1-year-old love this game. It's simple rules and no setup makes it easy to play and understand. The kids find the suspense very exciting. I will say that both my kids were able to pull the top jaw off of the crocodile in attempts to force the mouth closed. Fortunately it easily snapped back on.
4,Cute toy,"We found this at a thrift store for 50 cents. Needless to say it is worth what I paid. It keeps my under 5-yr-old crowd enthralled. My 16-month-old enjoys it the most, so I don't believe it's very scary. I played with it first and laughed at it closing down on my hand. Don't know if that cut out the scariness factor, or if my kids just weren't scared of this toy to begin with."
2,Not what I expected,"When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game."
2,Not as durable as I thought it would be.,"The crocodile dentist worked as it should for about one week. Great concept, but too flimsy. Pushing any of the teeth makes the croc chomp down. Not supposed to work that way."
2,broken in days,"I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Then, the top part of the mouth kept falling off and I had to keep putting it back on until it just completely broke and wasn't able to play it again. I think it lasted at tops for a full week in our house and that was it. So, definintely doesn't hold up well at all!"
3,Crocodile Dentist,"I purchased this toy for my grandson with Special Needs. When my son went to school for his review they told him how much this toy was enjoyed by the kids including my grandson, however it was old and they couldn't find a replacement. When I found this one on Amazon, I got 3. One for the school, one for playing with at his home and the last one for playing at my home. He hasn't played with it here yet but will after the excitement of the holidays is over."
2,"Very small, flimsy and not working properly",Head gets stuck and does not snap. Very small and flimsy. I was disappointed with this and kids have not played with it at all. Should have taken heed to the other reviews which stated same.
1,Horrible,"My 4 year old hates this toy. Not only does it pinch when it snaps shut, but the same tooth triggers the snap every time. It didn't take him long to figure out which tooth NOT to pick. This toy was a huge disappointment this Christmas."
5,tougher then it looks,"My kids received this toy as a gift and at first I thought it wouldn't last more then a few weeks, but the toy is more durable then it looks. My kids have played it for months and its been dropped repeatedly on the floor, and its held up. Its a good game for younger players as well because it's quick and can hold their attention for the duration. My older kids ages 6 and 8 enjoy playing it also. for the price you can't really go wrong."
1,Purchased twice-never worked,My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem. Very disappointed.
1,awful,"I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,This guy has got SKILLS,"This is a really good album! If you're into rap you'll love this! There is also a song w/ Juvenile and BG from Cash Money Records...trust me, Chino is from my home town of Akron, and he delivers, definately!"
5,Great Show,"The first 3-4 episodes of this show were absolute perfection. The latter episodes are not as tight as the first ones, but they still stand strong. I'm so happy they finally officially released this. I purchased an amazing copy on Ebay, of which I am still indebted to the guy who made those copies. They were near perfect and allowed to get a few of my friends addicted to the show years after it was taken off the air. I will admit that I wanted more 'behind the scenes' stuff, but once again, we are very lucky we have anything. This is a great show and probably the best show/cartoon MTV ever put on the air."
5,Original and funny-pretty well the basis why shows dont last.,"What an amazing and funny show, much like Arrested Development and Family Guy (just to name the obvious) it didnt make it. Family guy has rebounded. Clone High ended way to early to have a chance to do anything. Regardless, I really want to have these episodes at home to enjoy, it's a fun way to see western adolescent culture roles intertwined with some of histories must influential and important people. Original and funny, pretty well Why it didnt have a chance."
1,Where in the world is the original mix?,"I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on ""In Concert"" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the ""In Concert"" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."
4,Sounds great - Still Looks The Same,"Of course, this is a classic concert and whatever quality it encompasses should be forgiven. But what's to forgive? First, the sound has been remastered and really is a major improvement over the previous film. It really was the ""Spiders"" last concert and needs to be seen as that, in a historical perspective. The cinematography is, well...less grainy, but the camera is still bouncing quite a bit. You can't have everything! If you are a purist and just cannot stand an imperfect film, then take a pass. Otherwise, this is a great collection of fifteen songs from ""Hunky Dory"" and ""Ziggy Stardust..."" (plus some) presented at the height of glam rock when glam rock really mattered. In that respect, not many others than Bowie really did."
2,Agree with Maltin,"I am a Bowie fan and I found this unlistenable and almost unwatchable. Pennebaker obviously had a very low budget, and probably the film sat around for years before he pieced it together in a lame moment. I enjoyed seeing the different costume changes most..."
1,You must be a Bowie fanatic to recomend this dvd...,"As a David Bowie fan of his earlier music, I was extremely disappointed by this ""presentation"". Poor music selection, terrible arrangements, sound quality befitting old 8mm home movies, and grainy picture. I believe this was shot with 2 hand held cameras focusing exclusively on Bowie, almost completely ignoring his band members. Do NOT waste your money on this dvd!!!"
3,Fine for what it is...,"I got this pack for my 3 year old who is very interested in 'gadgets' - compasses, watches, etc. I got it b/c it had alot of these things and was pretty inexpensive and thought it would be fun for him to open. I will say that he and his brother have enjoyed it, in particular the binoculars and the compass watch - and they run filling the pack with different things and going on adventures. Its absolutely fine for what it is, but nothing amazing! I would buy it again."
2,pretty but delicate,"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
4,Response to review by karen b,"FYIWith Windows XP you can run programs in what is called 'compatibility mode', and one of the compatibility modes you can choose is Windows 95.To do this, install the program, then find a shortcut to the program (in the program's start menu folder, on the desktop...). Then right-click on the shortcut and select ""Properties"" from the popup menu. In the Properties dialog, select the ""Compatibility"" tab. In that tab, check the box labeled ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and select the appropriate Windows version from the dropdown list (in this case, Windows 95). Click ""OK"" until all the dialog boxes are gone. The program should now work just fine. I run several older programs on Windows XP, and I use this for all of them."
1,Beware,"I cannot rate this item since I cannot load it, it will NOT run on Windows XP, you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete. It does not say this clearly in the product description"
3,"Buena pieza literaria pero cruel, despiadada","Ãsta no es una novela para pasar un rato agradable.En la historia aparecen muchos sÃ­mbolos o representaciones sobre la sociedad humana y esto puede ser interesante para varios lectores, pero la esencia de la novela es cruda, fuerte, inmisericorde.El hecho de que los protagonistas sean jÃ³venes no la convierte automÃ¡ticamente en literatura juvenil. Sugiero leerla antes de recomendarla o regalarla."
2,Not nearly enough detail,"It seems as if the author tried to get the book out the door as quickly as possible. If you are totally new to Tomcat, then you can read the book, but there is not much substance at all for anyone trying to actually implement Tomcat."
5,Excellent Coverage for the Developer,"I picked this text up three days ago and I am very pleased with everything I have read. It really takes the angle of administering the Tomcat server with the developer in mind.Some of the areas that I found most useful included coverage of Servlet Filters and Tomcat Valves, a chapter on embedded Tomcat applications, and a great Appendix covering the server.xml file.I recommend this book for any developer, or administrator, looking for the fast track to using Tomcat."
3,Apache Jakarta-Tomcat,Good in the sense that it is compact and offers a high-level overview of JSP and Servlets-but not enough examples to allow you to design professional apps. This is not a good book for a detailed description of how to configure Tomcat.
1,Yuck!,"I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. I tried twice to watch it, and both times quit in disgust."
1,A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.,"First, forget anything about ""Frankenstein."" This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled ""God, This Movie's A Monster!""For what it's worth, the cinematography was good."
4,See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!,"""Gods and Monsters"" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie."
5,POWERFUL & WONDERFULLY FILMED,"I never really knew of Mr. Whales' history as an ""out"" director, at a time when homosexuality was ""swept under the rug"", ,considered a sickness , & VERY hush-hush.The 3 main characters could not have been played any better. In my opionion, Ms. Redgraves finest performance, and Sir Ian's as well.Brendan Fraser was perfectly cast as the gardner whose physical stature somewhat resembles ""Frankenstien"" to Sir Ians' James Whale. The photogrpahy, direction, sets,costumes, and the remarkable resemblance of stars gone by are what makes this film 1 of my all-time faves."
5,Great Movie!!!!,I think that was an awesome movie! I am a total fan of Brad Renfro and I have seen all of his movies. He is THE greatest actor I have ever seen in the movies. Everyone should see this movie.
2,"Boring, boring, boring!","Perhaps I'm just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Yet I've watch others made in that time and they are still enjoyable and very interesting. I couldn't get into this one at all and felt that I was about three or four steps ahead of the plot all the way along."
3,Getting Better!,"The latest edition of ""Interchange"" is certainly an improvement on the original. Teachers who have been using the old book for years will be relieved to see agonizing sections from the old book removed. And the subject material and sequencing of grammar,listening and speaking activities is better too. The workbook is also vastly superior to the old workbook . However, one of the major weaknesses of the old book still remains-the Teacher's Book. The lack of an abundance of really good speaking and grammar activities forces the teacher to do a large amount of preparation work. Here's a tip- supplement Interchange with Heinemann's ""Reward Resource Books""."
5,Exceptional Learning and Understanding!,"Highly recommended for day-care centers and early-learning centers for story-time. Very helpful to all children especially bi-racial and foreign nationals. Also a great start for the younger children--they understand everything!!!Dr. Henderson..... ""you go, girl"""
1,Trading one bad habit for another,"Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn't know why at the time)...WOW Crystal...I can think of a few titles for your next book. I even remember our chance meeting....it's a small world after all!"
5,Brilliant!,"This is a truly brilliant book. It enables the reader to learn what he has been doing right and wrong in his relationship life.Every man who wants to develop his ideal relationship with his girlfriend/wife must read, learn and live this book."
3,"1 "" of Boring","I bought it to read about the man's unusual character, not baseball jargon and statistics (although I'm sure it is accurate.) The 1st 2/3 is as dry as army meatloaf. IMHO not told with the right touch of humor if any. Eventually it covers his personality, but why do I feel like it is Tuvok describing an alien?"
5,"The Babe, Bigger than Life","The title of the book describes what you will find inside, his life. He was a legend which to this day is the standard ball players are being compaired. The book is well written, does not bog you down, keeps your interest from beginning to end. It describes his life, both on and off the field in a slightly different light than what we may have heard and seen growing up in the 60's as I did. I enjoyed the book, the history, the stories (true or not!) and the effect he had on the game of baseball. It's a good read, especially if you are a baseball/history nut."
1,for laser printers only,"This product is for laser printers only.You cannot put one of these transparencies into your home printer / injet printer, it will not print.The ink will bubble up.I sent back my order and still have not yet received my refund."
3,Overhead Transparencies,"These transparencies work well using overhead markers on them. If you want to make the transparencies on your computer, the printer ink does not dry, even after sitting out for a week."
2,Blah......,What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best.
4,Big Chill in Little London,"A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."
2,A little disappointed...,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-("
5,Mosbys medical dictionary,"Excellent dictionary has every term that you need, I use it everyday for school plus for my own at home, great explanations and pictures."
5,Best Medical Dictionary By Far!,I love this text it is filled with great pictures to help you understand what they are talking about. It also has easy to understand reading. Very thuroughly put together!
4,Some things not scifi anymore,"Think about the episode in the beginning when Matt's phone rings in the middle of a crowd. ""So what, his parents called his cellphone"" you may say. However, this was just pure fantasy in 1948."
1,Misses the Point,"I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as ""amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,"" ""disrupt the natural order of things,"" ""seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,"" ""seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,"" ""time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,"" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."
5,Required reading for understanding American politics,"Wawro's book studies a critical, and often overlooked, part of the legislative process: why do members draft and push bills through the legislature? While this might sound like a question with an obvious answer, Wawro points out that legislative entrepreneurship is costly and risky behavior. So why do legislators bear the costs and risks to draft and press bills?Wawro uses a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to test for four important possible factors which might lead legislators to become policy entrepreneurs: to gain support from their constitutents, to help campaign fundraising, to facilitate their position in the legislature, and partisan explanations. While I won't ruin the punchline for interested readers, I will promise that you'll be surprised at the answers which Wawro produces.If you want to understand contemporary American politics, you'll want to read Wawro's excellent book."
4,Good Bed,Good bed. Definitely big enough for a good size dog. I have a collie. Zipper with removable cedar bags make it good for easy cleaning. Cedar helps with keeping away fleas and reducing dog smell. Very soft and my dog loves it.
2,Disappointed,"I love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a Blue Rays DVD player. Which means I can't enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated. However, other purchases in the past have been great through Amazon."
2,Looks & feels like a bootleg product.,"My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby, much less DTS, only a PCM Stereo recording. Video is average. Like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthought.All in all, this looks like a bootleg edition. And no, it's an official release. Amazing. Messy. What were they thinking?"
4,Nice for auto organization,"We purchased two of these. They fold up easily, but when they are set up, they hold quite a bit. We put one inbetween the driver & passenger seats of our van. It seemed like we always had stuff sitting there, so I wanted it a bit more organized. I think this product was worth the price, and it works well for us. It shipped quickly."
4,Nice!,"Pretty music, but the stereo sound is not as spacious as I would desire. I found that tinkering with the equalizer settings, etc. seems to help some. Another version of this music by Victor Fedetov has gorgeous sound, but less of the ballet than on this cd. I have no idea if this is the complete version of this work."
4,we are Witnesess,"The book I read was we are Witnesses by Jacob Bias. The book is about five teenagers who lived and died in the Holocaust. I liked this book because I interacted with how kids my age as Jews had to deal with the Holocaust. The teens in this book had to hide and live there lives as people in attics or camps. They were driven out of their homes most belongings left behind. Some of their family were taken away like there dad or mom. Even in hiding some were robbed, not only the families in this book went through this but all the Jews who lived around Europe during the holocaust. Some Jews survived the holocaust but millions of Jews died and in this story you read about how these teens had to deal with it."
1,all cracked up,"Freezer mug worked great for about 2 months - then it cracked and leaked all over freezer - lost my receipt and didn't know how to return - just found how to return, so have to pay shipping and can't get full refund...sad :("
4,Excellent Translation!,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the ""Good News"" and the ORIGINAL ""Revised Standard."" I have respect for the ""King James,"" the ""New King James,"" the ""Jerusalem,"" the ""English Standard Version,"" and the ""Holman Christian Standard."" I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the ""Revised Standard"" and the ""New King James."" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the ""Revised Standard."" But that said, the ""New American Standard"" is excellent."
3,Not as it appears,"The cover didn't say ""New American Standard Bible""; it said ""Holy Bible"" and the cover is made out of awful, stiff cardboard stuff that is made to look like leather. This was $10 and I'd hoped for a better cover. The inside is fine. I was just disappointed with the cover."
4,Was he?,"The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in ""Operation Mincemeat"" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research."
5,High tension drama !,"""The man who never was"" is truly, one of the most dramatic and smart plans of espionage during the WW2. based on a real fact, the British Intelligence Service pull the wool over the Nazi officials around the fake invasion plans found in a corpse dressed of British soldier. Intriguing and hair-raising all the way through. Directed by Ronald Neame (Tunes of glory), one of the most prominent British directors of his generation.This film -like the good wine- improves through the years."
1,Awful Service,Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!
5,Catches teens attention,I work with teens in detention facilities. They love the Degrees of Guilt series! It touches their world. I highly reccommed it for any teenager. This book is my favorite of the three. It touches what it feels like to not fit in and to have your life a mess. It also shows how easily you can fall into wrong choices that lead to severe consequences.I think any teen would like it and relate to it. I liked it myself as an adult. It is very true to the teen world.
1,PURE JUNK,"SO CHEAP AND POORLY MADE THAT WHEN YOU USE THE ITEM IT CUTS YOUR FINGER, EVERY SINGLE TIME"
4,"excellent, comprehensive book",This book effectively addresses the continuum of sexually distructive behaviors and all the spiritual depravity in all of our hearts. The chapter on restoring your marriage is particularly helpful.
2,Meh.,"Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys."
2,Looks Good but Step-by-Step Diagrams are not Provided,"I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Looks great for older kids.Also, its NOT NXT."
5,Good To Go,"This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego. Lyrics, beats are all great. He brings the best of evrything down and drops it like no other. Ya should also check out Don Omars King Of Kings another crazy album."
3,The last one was better but still worth 12 bucks!!!!,"This was another good enough outing for Tego but he could do much better. The guy is too good to just have okay albums they should all be instant classics and this one just isn't his break out cd ""El Abayarde"" was testament to his nastiness on the Mic. The last Cd had its moments this one does to but they just aren't as bright."
5,Disturb not the dream,I have read and re-read this book and I enjoyed it.I thought it would make an interesting movie.It was a good mix of good and evil combined.
5,Word biblical commentary vol. 1 Genesis 1-15,"Im just getting into this commentary and so far so good,excellent material, very technical and informative. I highly recommend it."
3,Just ok,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I can't say I was impressed. There are some funny moments and some cute dialog between the two cousins, but overall, it was a somewhat boring read. The story got old quick and I had a hard time paying attention to what was going on, or even caring for that matter. The one plus is it is a nice book for someone who would prefer not to slog through a lot of useless, gratuitous sex and vulgar language. I guess to be fair, I need to try another of this series before I judge too harshly. If you are looking for a fast paced, exciting, sit on the edge of your seat mystery, this is not the one"
3,Ummmm.....,"I must say after hearing this CD that I'm a little disappointed. Not in Stacie- she's obviously talented. It's just that the songs seem so wrapped up in the production that poor Stacie gets lost sometimes. Can she sing? I think so, but unlike the Rachael Lampa CD, you never really get a chance to find out. I think somewhere in there, a great singer is dying to get out. Next time, let her sing!"
4,Great Cd!,"This CD is great! I heard one song off of it and then I just had to pick one up. I'm a young person so I'm into the strong beats, and R&B grooves that Stacie does so well. But after a while, you are more into the beats, rather than her lyrics. And her lyrics are very good! They reach out to her generation. So if you are going to buy this CD, don't hesitate to stop and listen to the lyrics!"
5,*Very Good Debut CD!*,"I really liked this CD! If you're into her type of music you'll love it! I really like all her songs, except for ""O O Baby"" which kind of got on my nerves. But other than that, this CD is well worth the money!"
5,coinera,Love her music. My daughter loved the cd. Everything was great. Satcie Orico is extremely talented and sings Christian music that will uplift you. Very contemporary.
3,Defect,"I really liked the size and the font but the pages were coming off the binding. Also, the snap was too difficult and I think using it would cause the binding to separate. I returned it but would have loved it except that one main issue."
3,Good read,"Putting the typos aside, it was a pretty good read. Didn't love it....but it was decent. His style is a bit terse."
5,Bradley is the best Smoker.,"Bradley pucks are hands above any other smoker. The key is their concentrated bisquettes which have concentrated flavor with no adulterants and you control the time (20 minutes per puck). If you are considering a smoker, these are the woods to get. Maple is a great mild flavor."
5,great product,As advertsed. Good product. all of the bradlet biscuitts are great. have used nearly all flavors and get good results.johnny
5,Ry's own voice................................,"A bit of a ""return to his own roots"" effort in that Ry:(a) sings in a style I remember him most for, that is, in a straightforward unstrained manner, as he did on his great earlier albums, and(b) brings back to his arena some political folk sentiments, some Woody Guthrie/Pete Seeger style sprinklings along the way.And he also brings along something rather new for him, a concept album built along a developing lyrical theme. So we have a story line that runs the length of the album.As always, excellent sidemen and women bring invaluable contributions. But my first thought on hearing this was that Ry was letting his own voice take its rightful place in the mix again, while still allowing room for the guests and (of course) his own string playing."
4,everthing old is new again,"The music is superb. The lyrics/stories contained are not nostalgic, per se, but rather a reminder of a time when social consciousness was admirable and brave. This ranks with Cooder's best. As with Chavez Ravine, it's not for everyone, but for most folks who enjoy musical craftsmanship and also having their intellects tweaked a little, remembering the past and reframing their concept of the present, it's sheer pleasure. Better luck next time, Nick."
3,Almost a classic but a few flaws.,"Ok here I go.I'm not going to ramble,babble or nit pick.I enjoyed listening to this album.Its a story about a cat,a mouse,and a toad who takes a journey through various life experience of yesterday.Its a clever well thought up album from Ry with all the great lyrics and colorfull characters.The opening track Suitcase In Hand is a poppy tune and stays with you throughout the even tiresome track of Green Dog and the yawnfull track of The Dying Truck Driver.He wraps the album up with a pleasant track called There's A Bright Side Somewhere but its too short.This album is worth getting and he uses great people to colaberate with such as Jim Keltner,Mike Seeger,Pete Seeger,Joachim Cooder and others.Its folky,bluesy and enjoyable just skip over the boring tracks."
2,Buddy,"I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder.Musically,it sounds like so much hillbilly and not at all what I have come to expect from an artist whom I have admired for decades.I bought the album unheard,purely on past experiences,but sadly did not enjoy it at all."
5,A DARK DYNAMIC DOWNHOME DUSTBOWL DIAMOND,"Music and politics don't mix, just like church and state don't mix. Lighten up Nick, this is music, not a political attack. I love the concept of this album, although I haven't heard it yet, like Nick, but I will someday real soon.To other readers disturbed by Nick's review - check out his other reviews, he doesn't favor too many things. And the stuff he does like, pop band Pilot - now there's a band on the cutting edge that I'm going to rush out and buy! I actually have a Pilot vinyl recording from long ago, I didn't know they ranked to be put on CD.As of March 14, I have listened to this disc - and it is very good. One of Mr. Cooders best. Dense, deep, diversified, devilish, didactic, and dedicated to the working man, the downtrodden, the disillusioned, the disenfranchised - stuck on ""d"" words today. Anyhow, any recording with this much of Mike Seeger contributing has got to be one thing - DeLuxe!"
5,Did I Hear You Say Ry Cooder Album Is About a Cat; as In Kitty Cat?,"Ry Cooder's latest album is an folk music opera to a rambling cat named Buddy who sleeps in a little suitcase and hobos around America with his best friend, a pro-labor union mouse named Lefty.Huh?...come again? No, Ry Cooder has not lost his mind. Let me assure all doubters that ""My Name Is Buddy"" is not only his most audacious recording to date but arguably his best.Knowing what you do about Ry Cooder's impeccable musical reputation do you think he'd risk it all to write a bizarre roots music epic about about a working class hobo cat? Don't think too long about the question because the entire idea seems so laughably absurd. It is not our place to question artistic genius.In reality Cooder's musical statement tells us more about human relations than animal behavior. I can only tell you that you're missing something very special if you can't suspend disbelief and listen to this album on Ry Cooder's own artistic terms."
3,Good--but it doesn't hold together for me as well as the reviews described,"I got the CD because I like Ry Cooder and like the concept of a story-CD. For me, ""Chavez Ravine"" felt like a more cohesive body of material, though.I cannot fault the musicianship and the storyline is fascinating. Anyone who has a past anchored in the Dust Bowl area will identify with the stories---Cooder must have done his research from testimonials of folks who'd been there. If you are interested in this topic, the Oklahoma Historical Society has an extensive oral history collection, plus there were many interviews conducted by the WPA during the Depression. (The Indian Pioneer Histories)One thing, I'm happy I got this CD used. I'd probably rate it less if I'd paid $16.99 for it and seen the 'eco packaging' already raveling at the edges. Yes, I'd like friendlier CD covers, but please can we at least get archival quality here? I do plan on keeping this CD."
3,SINGLES,"ITS ABOUT TIME VICKY LEANDROS PUT OUT AN ALBUM IN ENGLISH,SHE RECORDED MANY SONGS IN ENGLISH AND THESE SHOULD BE ON A CD,WAY OVERDUE FOR HER,NANA MOUSKOURI RECORDED IN ENGLISH WHY NOT VICKY"
4,Great product,"This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin."
5,Beautiful Goodbye,"This is a beautiful goodbye to a world famous artist. This is Celia's party and it's a good one! Like some of the producers say of this production 'We wanted REAL reactions, not fake ones'. All of the artists were REAL in their goodbyes. Miami had a special light that night. Los Trio, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Gloria Estafan with Patti LaBelle, Don Pedro Knight--the performances were outstanding."
2,Regret Purchase,It felt very sad to me as Celia just sat there. I expected more based on the reviews and I was very disappointed.
2,Wasn't what I wanted,"This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight."
5,Great,Sooo happy to have found these again. Great product!!! Work just as well as I remembered. Thank you Chore Boy!
5,Wonderful scrubbies!!!!!!!,"I used these along time ago and could not find them anywhere. I then found them at my church when I was cleaning, and had a name to research. I looked on Amazon and there there were, they are great for all types of dishes and pots and pans. Do not scrub too hard on plastic as there will be scarring, but they clean and do not get smelly. Highly recommend.!!!!!"
3,3 stars,"Night In Eden started out strongly. I was intrigued with the Australian setting and sympathized with the hero and heroine. Both had experienced great losses recently and striving to overcome them.The character of Bryony was well-developed and multi-demensional, however, I felt a little cheated in regards to Hayden. I don't think there was enough from his point-of-view for me. I didn't always know what he was feeling or thinking. The author would touch on it, but not elaborate as she did with the heroine.The sexual tension was good, but I was expecting more from the rave reviews. There wasn't much of a build up. It was just all of a sudden ""I want her"". I wasn't ever sure if the hero ever really *loved* her.Overall, this was a good book. The writing style was favorable and the setting was different, but the many tragedies set a pall over it that didn't leave me ""satisfied"".This is my first book by this author and I will try another before giving up."
4,Fine Read,"I would have given this book five stars but I feel it had a really slow start. But after the first few chapters, the sexual tension between the main characters began to heat up. REALLY HEAT UP! I found myself getting into this book and I would recommend reading it. Although you may think it is boring at first, it will seriously grab your attention. Give it a try."
1,It made me gain weight.,"This stuff... sucks. At first, I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael's book, Making the Cut. It's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid. I don't have hypothyroidism, but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl. 10 lbs later, I realized I may be taking more than just ""guggul"". My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it, because I gained 10 lbs in a month! I am a healthy eater, and I work out 5-6 days/week because I'm also a personal trainer. The way I see it.. don't waste your money, if you think you have a thyroid problem, go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs, the ones where you know exactly what's in them."
1,A Waste of a Picture,"This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?...."
5,An Outstanding History of Efforts to Learn the Geology of the Moon,"This lengthy and detailed account of lunar exploration and science strikes a balance between personal memoir and history. As history it provides a detailed and contextual account of lunar geology during the 1960s and 1970s, and a less detailed but informative account for the rest of the century. As memoir it provides an engaging story of the scientific exploration of the Moon as seen by one of the field's more important behind-the-scenes scientists who worked on Apollo.This is certainly the most detailed personal account of lunar science during the Apollo program, and should be read in tandem with Donald A. Beattie's ""Taking Science to the Moon: Lunar Experiments and the Apollo Program"" (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)."
3,3 and 1/2 stars...Major lunar geology discussion...,"Whew!...You almost need to take a geology class before tackling this. Wilhems goes into great detail describing the moon from a geologists standpoint, so be prepared for that, but, the things that I took from this is that he also describes the early history of the un-manned program of lunar exploration (Ranger and Surveyor programs) in excellent detail as well as the geology history of the manned program, training and all. Obviously, the later (Apollo 15 through 17) missions are covered in more detail than the early ones, but there is something here for everyone interested in the Apollo program...just be prepared to be inundated with geology-speak."
2,"This was not one of her best books, yet not a failure.","This book is really exciting;from the first chapter only. I am going to be honest with you, because if I raved about how wonderful and exciting this book was, it would be a lie. It was written with appropreate remarks and English grammer, but sometimes storys just don't get you in the heart. This perticular one didn't. But there are her other books, which I would say, are a masterpiece!"
4,One of the Best,"I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."
2,Dark is right!,"A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books."
3,Same exact product other vendors are sourcing from china,"Look around for the best price. I have ordered these from Amazon Vendors and from brick and mortar. Exactly the same item. Same exact ""made in China"" label in the same spot. Product does what it is needed to replace screws and pads lost on glasses."
4,Fast. Easy. Online.,"What's more to say about a product that works? I ordered two for my tenants so they can use the wireless network instead of running ethernet cable all around the house. Both were older machines running Windows XP. Installation was a breeze and both computers were online on within 10 minutes. Modem/router located in a downstairs bedroom. Upstairs computer gets a strong signal and the downstairs computer gets a stronger signal with speeds that rival a computer hard lined to the router. If there was one thing I could change about this product, it would be the pigtail on the antennae. There's barely enough slack for the antennae to sit on top of the tower. Good product."
4,Packet-Tastic,"This card is the fastest and most reliable wireless device that I have ever purchased. The reception is always 3 to 4 bars, even from across the house. My newer PC is mostly MSI components and contains a similar card as this model, so I knew this was the right choice."
5,Wireless delight,"After reading the reviews on this item, I still ordered it with some fear and trepidation, planning on tapping my knowledgable son-in-law to bail me out. Not needed at all. Opened the box, plugged it in, hooked up the antenna and Windows XP did the rest. Connected within minutes of booting up the computer. It is working just fine and I am very pleased."
4,Works great,This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.
5,Works As Advertised,"After reading the one star reviews, I am not convinced those reviewers reviewed the same product. I installed this wireless card in a Dell Optiplex GX280 and then installed Windows 7 RRM x86 (fresh installation). Windows 7 had a driver, loaded it, and that is it - connected to my Linksys wireless router at 54mbs. Very surprised that Vista users would have driver issues..."
1,Una porqueria no compre,"Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse, veo todas las redes pero no puede conectarse. lo barato sale caro"
1,DO NOT BUY!,1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
2,Keeps dropping the connection.,"I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon."
5,Breathe New Life Into Your Aging Desktop,"I was almost getting ready to ditch my Aging Dell Dimension XPS B1000r Desktop until I read a review of this this Wireless PCI Card. It is inexpensive and installation was a breeze. I installed the included software, input my AT&T ""2Wire Wireless Gateway"" WEP Key, rebooted the system and I was surfing the internet wirelessly in no time. Signal strength has been consistently rated excellent at 54.0 Mbps speed. My PC runs on Windows XP Pro. I downloaded the ""Ralink WMP-Rt2561ST"" driver as suggested by some reviewers but never installed it as my system is working just fine with driver bundled in the included CD. I found the length of the antenna cord more than adequate. I just sat the antenna on top of my desktop inside my PC cabinet: smart design."
2,Plus-Minus Chart Toy,"Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above."
1,Useless,"I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were. How are we supposed to read THROUGH a plastic button? It made no sense.This was really a disappointment and such a waste!"
2,Average Book,The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
2,A good source of propaganda!,"I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
3,Good Textbook - but good examples are missing,"O.K. The text covers the Java stuff you need to know. It has a clear structure and is definitely a very good textbook. But if you try to learn Java or try to make the transition from a non object-oriented langauge using this book - you'll miss some examples. Peter v.d. Linden would be better off sharing his programming experience by providing examples for the subjects he covers. Instead of giving a simple ""hello world"" program in the first chapter, he comes with a full blown, four color, text-scrolling, window based ""hello world"". Who the hell is supposed to understand the code when he or she never saw object-oriented code? But don't get me wrong - it is definitely a good textbook!"
3,For intermediate programmers only.,This book is far too basic for experienced programmers and probably too advanced for people who are just beginning to program.
2,Not for true beginners,"I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"
1,Please dont buy if you are entirely new to Java Concepts,"Firstly,Amazon's own review about this book - ""If you want to learn Java FROM ZERO..."" is entirely misleading. The author has written this book as if he is talking to his collegues(who obviously know Java) over the coffee table. If you want to learn Java from Zero , are new to programming concepts,OOPS etc. just stay as far as possible from this book and PLEASE dont go by the 4 and 5 stars this books has.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS and I STRONGLY REQUEST AMAZON to remove their recommentdation about this book for beginners.I have returned this book and am pretty comfortable with the following two books Thinking in Java and Beginning Java2.0 Please trust me and dont waste your time and energy and money on any other books to learn Java."
3,More fun than truly helpful.,This wedding guide shares lots of intersting trivia and information about the history of brides and nuptual celebrations. The actual advice is a little dated and not particularly unique from what you might find in other guides.
4,The end of an arc and some weirdness,"This series brings the end of the Alabasta ark and is a great finale...however, there are filler episodes at the end which some One Piece fans may not enjoy as much as others. Up to you if you watch them though as they are at the end, not in the middle, which is a nice way to lay them out."
4,The Hound From Hell plays well on Kindle,"I have the Kindle software on several of my computers, but this is the first volume that I read on my new Kindle Fire. It was a good choice. I'm not certain how many times I have read âThe Hounds of the Baskervilles,â but it is more than a couple, and this was as pleasurable as any. The price was right too. So, if you like Holmes, this is great read."
1,The Hound of the Baskervilles,"This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."
3,not a classic I would recommend,"I am a consistent nonfiction book reader - as long as I can remember.But I have a hard time with this book & lost interest. I followed the classic thru to the end, but it is not a book that I would recommend to another."
1,Nothing superb about Holmes.,"""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it. Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it. It was full of babble and slow adventures. Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book. I do not recommend."
4,This book is great!,"This is really good book I reccomend it: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson wait inside. It is late around 11:10 p.m. when they see a flash a light through the window. Then they hear a harsh mean howl at the lights apperance. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson duck down and be really quiet. Then they see the light again, but this time no howl. Then the light flashes again this time more like a flash light, light and sherlock knows it. He says , "" My dear Watson I think somebody is out there sending signals to us by light flashes""! Sherlock knows it for sure and then that day they hear that an exscaped prisoner is on the look and he is realted to the Baskervilles!"
1,Missing Passages,"Note: this is a review is specific for theThe Hound of the Baskervillesedition and not the book as a whole. The free kindle edition is missing any passage that would be considered source material in the book. If the character reads from a document, a newspaper, etc... it's just gone. Very disappointing. Don't bother with this version."
1,Passages missing,"This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues."
4,"Doyle, The Hound of The Baskervilles","The Hound of the Baskervilles is a book that I really can't criticize at all with any real power behind it. I really enjoyed this book. I started out with several short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, found them fascinating, and read this. I wasn't disappointed. The book is rather short so it kind of still keeps that short story feel. It also has the horrid skill of making the reader almost sick with the unknown. When I read this, I wanted it to end more than most other books I've read just to find out what was going on. Also, as a horror fan, I can definitely say that this book has horror elements in it. Some scenes are damn creepy and all scenes are completely necessary with no slow or dull moments to let you lose that building tention. Brilliantly told and a book that is a classic to me. And, in the end, there is always an explanation to satisfy the reader and this is a good one indeed."
4,Hounds of Baskerville,"Required reading for school, not much reason other than i had to buy it. The vendor was great. A great way to save money."
1,MISSING TEXT!!!!!!,"This review is NOT on the quality of the story. I love this book, however.... This edition is missing text. Whenever character reads out of a newspaper or other document, the entire txt of that newspaper or document is missing from this Kindle edition! I've no idea which version to spend the dollar on to get the complete text, but its frustating as this was my first download."
3,The Hound of the Baskervilles,The baskervilles has an interesting history and when Sir Charles Baskerville the 1 of the last living or was 1 of the last living decendents of the Baskervilles is found dead on the grounds of Baskerville Hall The legend of the hellhound hounts the moor is the hellhound real well that is what the greates detective in the world Mr. Sherlock Holmes wants to find out but he Mr.Holmes has to find the legend hellhound before the legend or hellhound finds him.
5,Extremely amazing,All I have to say this album is very worth the money to any die-hard Sailor Moon fan. With songs from all 4 seasons plus a few extras. Of course the stars songs are the best but then again I'm biased cause it is my favorite season. I totally recommend this album to anyone out there looking to listen to the original Japanes scores of music.
3,Buyer Beware,"This cd is protected from being utilized on a computer. If you listen to your cd's on a laptop, or desktop, this is NOT the cd for you. Consider yourself warned."
2,fort apache,The movie is old fashioned and not well acted. It was melodrmatic and artificial.The supplier of the DVD was prompt and professional
3,relativly good book,the book reads fast altough its rather small but it gives another point of view it the author talking about onperson who looks at all the person in a thirth person view wich makes it confusing from time to time but its a good book.
1,Instant Immersion English (5 CD-ROM set),5 disks that are related in title only. Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up. Poor graphics. This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language. I'm here on Amazon to buy something different.
3,"Great Speech Solutions, not much more","I teach ESL and love to use ONE disk from this set, the phonetic training program called ""Speech Solutions"". It is hard to find anywhere else, but it is worth having if you already feel good about most of your English language, and only need to work on the sounds you are making. It uses a simple, self-guided tour through all the phonemes, or sounds, of the American English language, including consonant pairs and ""r-controlled"" vowels.As far as the other disks are concerned, they might be fun for a novice reader who already speaks English, but they are useless as an ESL tool.Still, I'd buy it over again ust to get the speech program. Not for use with novice ESL students."
5,"Perfect, small stamp set for our toddler's little hands","I purchased this stamp set because I was looking for a small stamp set to use on my toddler's little hand to help reinforce positive behavior (long story, too many child development books!)If you are looking for a small stamp set that is safe and doesn't have harsh chemicals-- this is perfect. Most reviewers who were diappointed indicated that the size was too small. But the description is accurate: this stamp kit is 4 by 6 inches. That should give you an idea of the size of each stamp."
1,Disappointingly tiny,"I had bought a different Melissa and Doug stamp set that was an acceptable size, and assumed this would be similar. But this one is really too tiny. I couldn't tell from Amazon's picture just how small it was! There may have been an indication of the dimensions in the product description, but I missed it. Perhaps Amazon needs to be more clear about these things."
5,Awesome!,"Bought this for my 6 yr old who is currently obsessed with trains. Have watched it many, many times now! Very interesting for adults also. Highly recommend this for any youngster who loves trains. I also recommend I Love Big Trains part 1 & 2."
4,A Reader from Baltimore Maryland,"This is a pretty good book. The main focus is on the struggle of the Navajo people against the United States government. Tiana Bighorse's stories about her father that he told her make up this book's chapters. The stories are interesting and do a good job explaining the Navajo plight. The stories include fighting, running away, terrible atrocities commited by our government, and the struggle of her father and other warriors. On the whole the book is interesting and informative."
3,Sticky,"It is definitely quenching my skin's thirst, but makes my legs kind of sticky. I'm wearing a skirt today and my legs just keep sticking together, I feel like I have to peel them apart, and this is nine hours after applying it. I felt as though the glowing white of my skin was already gone after applying it just once. It left just a touch of color, which is what it claims to do."
3,"For the price, this has alot to offer","There is alot missing from this program (and most German programs out there, in my opinion), but it has some nice features. The games are just flashcard practice, but fun nonetheless. The speech recognition on CD 3 is not as good as German Now! 9, but still helpful. The picture dictionary isn't terribly helpful.The game on CD 5, Who is Oscar Lake, was what really made me want to get this. The concept is great, and after learning the interface and giving it time, it grew on me.Having fun and maintaining your interest in the language is the best way to learn it. That is a strength of this program, in my opinion. I would recommend using this program as a supplement to a class, textbook, or mabye a better program, because it is not comprehensive enough to stand alone. But for a good price, why not go for it?"
2,Poor Quality,The Book is old and discolored and is not the book you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. The copy in the picture is what I expected. And this book is not new. The one in the picture is the collector edition. I did not want just any copy.
3,Decent book quality,"The product was delivered on time. Good price. However, it was damaged in two places and it was suppose to be new. That being said it was not bad enough to go through the hassle of returning and getting a new one! Slightly disappointed in the quality!!"
4,Still a Classic After All These Years,"Well worth the short time it takes to read it. Had heard of this book all my life, but had never read it. Now I know what I was missing. Not that there is anything new here in terms of faith or theology--there's not. But the manner in which this story is told is entertaining and captivating, still, after all these years. Truths we have been taught and learned through our life's experience are here, all told in a most entertaining and enlightening way. It makes one smile, laugh and, at times, touches one's heart. If it is your first time to read it or your first time in a long time, it's well worth the read. Well worth it. We're all pilgrims and we are all traveling through a foreign land..."
4,Wonderful allegory of the Christian life.,"""The Pilgrim's Progress"" is widely known and widely imitated. Perhaps a bit too widely. While the book itself is stunning, having seen, heard, or read so many attempts to imitate it, I found that the original effect of the story was lessened for me.By all means, this book should be read -- it is in itself a great work of literature, and it is a prime example of Puritan thought. Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story! I shall be re-reading this in the not-too-distant future, hopefully better prepared to dismiss the memories of the imitations and to appreciate the genius of Bunyan's allegory.Read it!"
5,A Story For Everybody,"This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all."
4,Good quality,"Seems like a good quality vitamin, but my dog didn't like them too much. He ate them, but not enthusiastically."
2,Not as good as the other album!,"I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However, I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you. I was expecting more of Christy Baron's sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what I got was some sort of a synthesized versions. It's still a good album but it's nothing like the other one. If you can only buy one album of Christy Baron, don't get this one."
2,Emma as a deer in headlights!,"While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh! It is only because the rest of the cast was so good that I give this version of Emma 2 stars.If you want to see an Emma worth watching, buy the Gwynneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale version."
2,"""O Brother"" Fans Beware!","Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
1,Makes it's point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography,"Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy."
2,Last Tango In Paris,"The video I recently purchased was NOT the original version. The Hayes Commission version is edited for content to the point the film loses it's provocative edge, with out which is disjointed (pun intended) and boring. I've looked elsewhere for the original release version which at the time was X rated, but now all I see is the ""R"" rating which means all the good scenes are cut out!But I'll Keep looking. It's a real hot classic in it's original formRapscallion"
1,Last Tango in Paris,Poor content. Had to read what was going on by reading the screen as most of it was in another language.
2,One long WTF? moment.,"We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
1,"Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time","Don't waste your time. If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either. Glad I saw this free, as I would hate to have paid even $1 to watch it. Your life will be better for NOT having seen this movie."
2,Extremely disappointing,"This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time."
5,"Last Tango, Great Film",Last Tango in Paris is truly one of the greatest films of the 1970s. Marlon Brando gives a very powerful performance as Paul the middle aged widower who has a sexual liason with a chance encounter. A fascinating motion picture to say the least.
1,dawn on a distant shore,"Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work."
5,Waterproof!!,"Just used this tent for the first time this weekend. My husband and I camped for 3 nights in Vermont, 2 of those nights it rained. No water inside the tent at all!! We have never had this experience before!! We did not use any waterproofing spray or seam sealer, but we did use a tarp underneath. Don't waste your time with the plastic provided stakes, buy good ones. There is plenty of room for 2 people in this tent with a queen air mattress, although I think 2 twins on opposite sides of the tent would offer the best use of space. Wonderful tent, easy, quick set-up. Love this tent!!"
3,Recently purchased,"I bought this tent and used it for the first time recently. Good points: The tent is HUGE. I am 5'9"" and could stand all the way up in the tent. The gear loft is nice and there are lots of storage pockets inside. Bad Points: Tent Poles are outragously heavy. This is definately not a tent you would want to carry very far. There are a few seams at ground level, one right in the middle of the floor. It rained the first night we set up and some moisture came in from the bottom of the tent. Luckily we had a footprint on the inside of the tent as well. Overall this is a good buy for the price I paid. I bought the tent for $99, and noticed the price is now $179. I don't think I would pay that much for this tent."
1,A Claustrophobic Mess,"Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent. I did not care one bit for the women or their fates. If there's a sequel, count me out."
3,Expected better,"I guess I expected more from the movie because of all the rave reviews about it but in the end my husband and I were left feeling disappointed. The beginning was long and drawn out which began to bore, the female cast could not have been made up of more annoying actors (we were so ready for them to start dying)and I just could not understand WHY they did not realize they were at the wrong cave to begin with!!! Obviously the one the egotistical Juno led them to was not accesable, nor was it meant for, non-professional cave explorers! I guess its meant to show what can happen if you just blindly trust someone. I gave it 3 stars because the creatures were very effective at what they do and were very menacing to look at, also I liked the fact that they were blind but still lethal. I really wanted to like this movie alot and was loooking forward to watching it but ended up feeling let down."
2,Boring movie with good Blu-ray features,"THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in ""behind the scenes"" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes. I bought it for ten bucks at Wal-mart and I guess it was worth that for the cool features on the Blu-ray but I sure feel ugly and bored after watching it all."
1,ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!,"Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
2,horror for ten year olds,"Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does.) Right there the filmmaker lost all credibility with me, and not only that, you could hardly see/make out what the hell was going on with anyone; they made the cave that damn dark.I paid more than seventeen bucks for the DVD, tried to return it, unsuccessfully (Target won't accept returns, unless it is for the exact same thing) so ended up giving it to a friend. I don't keep DVDs I have no respect for in my collection.This was not well written, either, and don't believe this film director gets the horror genre at all.I suppose I'll be waiting for the next Alex Aja flick. Now here's someone who UNDERSTANDS what horror is about."
4,good movie,"I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies."
4,Stay Far Away from Caves,Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
4,Good movie,I loved the coming attractions more than the flick but it is still good epescially if you like the this type of flick. I think if they didn't show the creatures so much it would have been a little more scarier. Either way it seems very original at least midway through the end. I own it and have watched it a few times. It definitley has replay value. Watch it in the dark.
2,over rated,had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least. No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death!!
3,Not BAD,"not as bad as I thought it was going to be. not really scary or anythingbut it was interesting . its too bad they didnt do more with this movie ,it could have been so much better."
3,Predictable But Still Entertaining,"This movie started off slow at first but started to pick up once the group of women descended further into the cave. What happened while they were down there was predictable, but still entertaining nonetheless. The best part of the movie was when two of the women were battling it out with those slimy human-like creatures, whose presence bewildered me. I saw slimy human-like men and women, but no offspring? Wouldn't they want to eat human flesh too? Then there was the pool of blood. How in the world did it get there? The ending wasn't as ""happy"" as I expected to be, which was somewhat of a surprise. Overall, ""The Descent"" is still a good movie to watch, but ""The Cave"" is better."
4,I'm gonna sleep now... wait! What just happened?!,"This movie had no point of showing a car accident and some pipes went through a girl's head. And the beginning and the first half of the middle was all thrill and boring. When you first see the crawlers, you would think it's been like 2 hours of the movie. But I would give you all anadvice, don't watch horror movies in really sunny, bright day time! It's not because it wouldn't be scary then, horror movies alway take place in a dark place and if you hear screaming or someone getting killed, you're gonna wonder how or what just happened! 'Cause that's what happened to me wile watching this. And how can those crawlers be real cavemen that are cannibals? There were no cavemen in America! There is no way that those crawlers could be people that just mutated and wanting eat any living things. This movie did have hardcore killings! I would give you another advice and not buy the DVD but just rent it. I can't wait for Descent 2 this year!"
1,Blows!!!,"As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money."
3,Happy to find my favorite discontinued lipstick but...,"I loved the Stila Nicole color and as usual when I find a lipstick I love it always seems to be discontinued.I was so happy to find the lipstick and I ordered 3.they arrived less than a week later but to my surprise...it smelled and tasted a bit rancid....I think they have been around to long....oh well, I learned my lesson."
3,VERY SEXY,"My husband thought this was great. Being 5'2"" I found it to be just nice. Like I said my hunny loved it. He didn't notice that since it was made for taller women the legs were slightly baggy on me(men!). If your short and don't intend to wear it out of the bedroom then It does the job. I wouldn't recomend wearing it under a dress though for the above reason no matter how much he begs."
5,MAGIC is FUN...WE'RE DEAD,"I've been waiting for a decent DVD ""print"" of this movie for years. This is really a find. The transfer is amazing and the special features are well worth the ticket price.The disc even includes the famous TV commercial that scared so many kids the networks had it pulled. 'Didn't matter. If you saw it once, it stuck in your head....""Magic is fun....We're Dead!""The soundtrack is MONO but that's the way it was released in the theaters and it sounds really rich.I'm giving this one 5 stars for good reasons."
1,More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony,"Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and ""Legends of the Fall""; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."
4,Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins,"My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it."
3,"Excellent movie, terrible tape quality and editing","I have loved this movie since it was released. I had searched for some time to find it in a rental shop or movie store. I found it here and bought it. The tape quality is terrible, but worse is the awful edit job that was done. This is like a TV version of the original film. The film gets 5 stars, but the tape quality and editing bring the overall rating down to 3."
4,Great value - dump your inkjet and save money per page,"Went out and got one of these from Staples (an Amazon partner ahem) on special for ninety nine bucks. For that, it's a great deal. I use it on my computer running Ubuntu Linux (Dapper Drake 6.02) and it works great. Had to figure out how to use foo2zjs (foo2zjs dot rkkda dot com has the perfect workable answer to installation...I donated a few dollars for the help), but once you follow the instructions and load that all-important firmware, you are in business, even allowing you to set the printer to toner-saver mode, etc.We also use tonerrefillkits dot com extensively and just refill the cartrdige over and over until the head starts wearing. By then we have saved tons of money using a refilled laser printer vs. buying the cartridges or god forbid using a color inkjet (eek expensive).Good stuff, love HP, thanks!"
2,Doesn't Seem to Work with Print Servers,"This printer is inexpensive and fast but does not seem to work with either Linksys (WPS54G) printservers, DLink printservers (DP-G310), or Hawking printservers (HWPS1UG). I went through several phone calls with excellent support people at both Linksys and Hawking Technology to no avail. I upgraded firmware and installation programs but as far as the printservers are concerned the HP does not exist on the network.I have no idea what the problem could be but the HP1020 is not printserver friendly as far as I can tell. It is not as if I am running some obscure printservers either. The printerserver's company's products are well known and stable."
3,HP LaserJet 1020 Printer,"It woorks very well.But when I cancel it because of error, it took forever to cancel.So I can't wait anymore an I turn off and turn on gain.Sometimes I use next printer in other to finish it quickly.This is not convenient compare to other printer."
5,A Great Printer for the Price!,"I have only had the printer for about a month, but I think it's great. The only downside is that the UBS adapter is not included with the printer (You can pick one up at Staples for about $19). You can probably order one at Amazon as well...I just didn't realize I'd need to purchase the adapter when I ordered the printer."
2,"Great printer, unless you're using Vista","I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars, but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista. HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year. So if you want to print now and not wait six months, and you've already upgraded to Vista, I recommend getting a different printer. Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers. Vista has been in beta for a long time, so I find this delay to be inexcusable."
2,No Driver for the Windows XP Pro x64 Operating System,"The LaserJet 1020 is a fine printer for use with older operating systems. It produces high quality output when attached to my Windows 98SE box. But it doesn't print at all when attached to my new computer with its XP Pro x64 operating system. The problem is there's no compatible driver available, not on HP's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website. I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds, using x64 drivers for other HP printer models, but neither worked. Tech Support now says to try working the problem via online chat. I'll try that next time I have a block of several hours free, unless I give the printer away first."
3,Curls Quality/Heavy Paper,"Very severely curls papers that are heavy/thick/quality. If you use thick paper this printer will not do, as I have learned the hard way. A review in pcmag or pcworld also states this. very huge drawback.Even if you're just printing it for personal use, sheets get so curled that I have to take time to roll them up the opposite and try to get them flat."
3,"Good movie, bad packaging","This is not a review of the DVD content but more of the physical item itself. I was pretty excited when the package arrived but to my dismay, I heard a rattling sound as I took the DVD out. As I feared, the DVD came off its holder and was bouncing around the whole time during shipment. I immediately looked at the reverse side of the disc and yes, it was scratched pretty badly.To be fair, the DVD was still watch-able but I just sucks to receive a scratched DVD."
4,Make wikis and blogs,"A popular open source Content Management System. Meloni suggests here in her book why it has proved so useful. If you read her book and have some familiarity with Microsoft's Office suite, then you can see what Plone offers. The various Microsoft applications, like MSWord, have very rich toolkits. But each application essentially handles single documents. Meloni shows that Plone's remit is at a higher level of organisation. More to do with workflow between several users.Plus, these users need not be in one physical location. Plone lets a group distributed over the Internet work together. Plone can help enable new types of dispersed ""multinationals"" of just a few people.The book also has merit in showing how to use Plone to construct wikis and blogs. Two topical subjects. And very closely related. So both are described in the same chapter. Daresay that some of you will find this the most useful section of the book."
3,"good, but outdated and unsupported","If you're looking to buy this book now for use with a modern incarnation of Plone, you may want to rethink your decision and look elsewhere. Aside from being written against Plone 2.0 (Plone is currently at version 2.5.1, with 3.0 looming in a few months), and thereby having some tips and instructions that no longer work as originally intended, the book includes some typographical errors (as do many books), a few of which are horrible and misleading. I've actually done everything from inquiring with the publisher regarding errata (you won't find any on the publisher's site for the book) and writing to volunteer the corrections myself (which went unanswered).The book is an excellent introduction to Plone and quite helpful as a kick-starter, but I would not by any means recommend it for use as a ""bible"" for what Plone is, can do, and can be customized to do today."
3,"""I Enjoyed This Book""","I read this book last year with my book club ""Sistahs With A Vision"". I enjoyed the storyline but the Adrian Betrayal episodes started to bore me. I truly enjoyed this book overall. I look forward to the next book!!!!!!!!Rhonda Gibson, Founder, First Annual African American Book Clubs & Readers Retreat 2000, 13-15 October 2000, Cherry Hill Hilton, Cherry Hill, New Jersey"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"TOOOO LONG AND DRAWN OUT. Reading this book, I found myself saying, ""GET TO THE POINT."" The plot of the story was nice (sort of), but it needed more action. In the beginning and towards the end there was too much talk about what I already heard over and over before. What really bothered me was that one character's point of view, didn't really give me an understanding of the other characters (especially Adrian).Before reading this book the title caught my attention. The title was really a big let down because there was not much ""Hell Breaking Loose."" Borrow this book from a friend and please don't ever buy the hard back."
4,Pretty good read,"Let's see -- the thing I loved the most about this book is the surprising twist. While I was reading it, at first I couldn't tell what was going on, but after I realized what happened, I felt the story was quite interesting to say the least. I must commend Ms. Spencer on her first novel and I look forward to ""Cubicles."""
5,Too hot to put down.,"Camika, I feel you girl. You are an awesome writer. I knew this story was too good to be true. What was wrong with Adrian? Mother knows best. Gregs mother knew something wasn't right about Adrian.Church going Shreese. She was just plain silly. I didn't feel sorry for her at all. My heart went out to Greg because he was all ready to settle down with Adrian but she had to go and mess things up.Camila, I await your next novel. Keep up the good work. Be Blessed!"
4,Remembered a Great Movie,"""Lilies of the Field"" was a great movie when first released. It is still as good as I remembered. Sidney Poiter deserved the Oscar that he received."
5,Buying good movies,This was a wondeful process. I would buy from Amazon again and again. It is especially great for the older hard to find movies.If anyone knows how to find the movie Madame X with Lana Turner and John Forsyth let me know. I haven't been able to find it anywhere. Thanks again
5,A heartwarming classic,"This movie is a true classic that has endured the test of time. Great performances by all, Sydney Poiter is amazing in his role as a construction/handyman who meets up with a group of German who want him to ""build them a shapel (chapel)"". An inspiring testimony to the power of prayer (and a little hard work). A true must see for all ages!"
2,2 Good Songs,"This album was basically horrible the only 2 good songs were the 2 singles ""Tush"" & ""Run"" the rest of the album was trash. I would definitely not recommend this album. All the beats are horrible and the collaborations suck too."
4,Pretty Toney Album - Ghostface ( 4.5 stars),"Ghostface had alot to live up to with this LP after droping such classiscs as 'Iron man' & 'Supreme Clientele', and if you ask me, he did. The album starts off pretty good with the mixtape banga 'Biscuits' featuring Ghost's protege' Trife of the Theodore Unit, then on to ""Kunta Fly Sh*t"" it's kind of like an interlude, but really good. Throgh the first half the album is golden with cuts like ""Beat the Clock"" and the 2/3 of the Lox assisted ""Metal Lungies"". It's the other half of the album that brings it down with tracks like ""Tush"" ,""Ghostface"" , and ""Tooken Back"" but don't get me wrong ""Tooken Back"" is not a bad track but is just not up to par with the others. Luckily the album is saved with the classics "" Beat the Clock"" & ""Run"". 'The Pretty Toney Album' is just short of a classic but with the unfitting tracks ""Tush"", ""Ghostface"" , and ""Tooken Back"" just holds the album down."
5,tight as f*ck,"This is a great cd. Ghost and Kanye West are here to save hip-hop and theyre doin a damn goog job of it. My favorite song is ""Biscuits"". Minus the skit, which are the only things i dont like about the cd, the whole album is amazing. You can almost feel his lyrics on every song"
3,House wife,It wasn't as entertaining as I thought it would be. Not bad but just not what I wanted to read
1,unuseful for this day and age...,I love frugal and economical but this book made no sense to me. Reminds me of the foxwoods books but not nearly as useful.My first Kindle book that I had to delete without even reading half.
3,keep it in historic perspective,"It was interesting for local recipes and ways to do housekeeping,however the rules of being a wife and good mother seem so restrictivecompared to today's lifestyle."
2,Frugal Housewife,"I was really hoping that this book would have up-to-date tips on saving money. A few pages into the book, I realized that rarely did the suggestions apply to today's world. I was only able to read just a few pages. Disappointing."
2,Poor Facsimile,"This reprint is a facimile of the original edition, but is poorly reproduced. It is a print-on-demand edition, and the original was scanned in halftone mode so that all the text has a dot-screen pattern making it uncomfortable to read."
5,"If you love the Anime, you'll love the Soundtrack","1 of 3 different soundtracks, this installment of the Trigun soundtracks is great. It flows with the series as it should and has some really good songs. A deffinate buy for any Trigun lover."
4,great movie,"jet li as usual made fast well choreographed amzing fight sceens.I found there were to many times where it looked like they were flying and it get's anoying after a while, but overall this was a really good movie and should be seen by every jet li fan."
3,Jackie Chan is NOT in this movie!,"I'm not sure what movie Amazon thinks this is, but it's actually a Wong Fei Hong pic starring Jet Li. And it's not his best, either. Yuen Woo-Ping did do the action choreography so it does have great fight scenes. Story was lacking though. Please, Amazon, try to get the titles and stars on these Chinese movies correct for once."
2,Not One of His Best,"I'm a long-time Zane Grey fan and thought I'd read all his Westerns, but apparently I'd missed this one. While I agree with the other reviewers about his compelling descriptions of the West and its beauty, overall I found the story both boring and didactic. Missing were the memorable characters of many other of his books; missing also was the kind of action that makes it hard to put my Kindle down. I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars."
4,Call of the Canyon,"Zane Grey gives a good description of the emotional attachment people develop to the canyons of the West. I grew up there, and I enjoyed the book."
3,A good read like all of Zane Grey's Westerns,I like reading any book by Zane Grey. Some of his books should be ranked among the Classics. There is no reason for excluding westerns from this accolade
4,A wonderful romantic Western.,"The story set in the 1920s New York and Arizona is a wonderful romance. The descriptions of the canyons and desert make me want to pack up the car and head out for an extended vacation in Arizona right away. The descriptions are indeed moving.The downside of the novel for me is just a little bit too much ""philosophy"" out of the post WW1 era. Grey harps a little to much on his ideal American Woman, American Family, the contrast between the idle rich in New York and the working folks out on the range in The West. There is way too much writing on the plight of W.W.I vets when they returned to America. But in spite of a lot of pages devoted to teaching Grey's message there is a wonderful romantic story to be enjoyed."
1,Boring book,"I had to buy this book for a class. It is the most BORING book ever. If you don't have to buy this, please save yourself the misery of having to read it and don't!"
3,I hope your tech-jutsu is strong,"A bit of tech know-how is needed to make the game playable on XP/Vista/7 (Primarily running EVERYTHING in Windows 95 Compatibility mode), and hunting down the patches is recommended. And even then the game freezes when you get close to winning the campaign. Setting that aside, its a fun game for anyone who's a fan of old-skool hexagonal turn based strategy gaming."
4,?,What can I say-it's Sean Paul. I bought the cd for my BF. Different version than the radio and only two songs on the cd. But he seems to like it. Did arrive quickly.
3,"Keeps coffee warm, at best.","I guess I shouldn't expect much out of a product labeled as a ""mug warmer"" but I was hoping that the temperature of the heating plate would be higher than it actually is.I find that it works best if you do not fill your mug to the brim as the mug is only be able to conduct the heat up to its middle.I have yet to try this but I assume it would also be more effective on mugs that do not have concave bottoms/ends, meaning that the bottom of the mug is directly in contact with the heating plate.Overall, I guess it does it's job. Nothing more, nothing less."
3,It's ok,It works ok. I had one before that kept the coffee super hot. This one keeps it warm. I guess it's better than it going cold.
4,Works good,Works good. Would like it to be hotter because it doesnt seem to keep my tea real hot but than I touch the top and OUCH so maybe they should make a mug that goes with this that will conduct the heat better. What I'd like to see. Great item for the price though.
2,Minimal heat and not much longevity,"First of all, the heat was not very impressive on this thing. Secondly, I received this item on December 20, 2011; it is now September 19, 2012, and it has already stopped working (Just shy of 9 months). I last used it 24 hours ago, and I just went to use it again, but there is nothing; no light, no heat, it's just dead. I may have only paid $8 for this, but I am not happy that I have to now order another one so soon. I will definitely be looking into another brand or model, because I don't want this to happen again."
1,TOTALLY USELESS!! READ THIS REVIEW,"I bought 3 of these for myself and 2 co-workers. (so its not that I got a faulty one) All 3 of us used it and agreed they are useless. Your drink will stay luke warm at best.It does ""warm"" the bottom of the mug though, so technically it isn't false advertising.Thanks for another crap product China."
2,Gunk,"This device does well enough keeping the coffee warm, but I have black gunk along the bottom of every cup and mug that has sat on the warming pad, which seems to come off only with a long soaking in CLR."
5,Great gift and a very useful item,"I purchased the Mug Warmer as a Christmas gift for a relative. Within a few days after opening the gift, I got a phone call raving about how fantastic and useful this item is. Good idea, and oh so practical."
5,Warmer for winter,"This is nice, and big enough for my small teapot at bedside when I like to slowly pour and sip my hot tea while watching a movie, it not only keeps hot tea warm, it even heats it up slowly if I need it to."
3,Not hot enough,I bought three of these mug warmers. i like the on/off switch feature. The only thing i don't like is it could keep my tea a little 'warmer!'
2,"Amost, but not quite there.",It looks good and functions well but the temperature is just not quite as hot as most coffee and tea drinkers prefer. Another 10-15 degrees and it would be perfect.
5,Awesome mug warmer!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend who practices piano all day and often lets his coffee go cold. He adores it! He says it keeps is coffee the perfect temperature. And if he's happy, then I'm happy with the purchase, too."
4,mug warmer as advertised,The advertisement for this warmer indicated it had the only two features that were important to me....on-off switch accessable on the warmer top and a top-visible on-pilot light. The blow-up feature on the sales/ad was very helpful in confirming these features. Product arrived promptly and was packaged very well. And-most importantly..it is still working!!
3,Warmer could be warmer,"This warmer keeps your drink warm, but if you want it to stay hot, this is probably not what you want. In all fairness, I have not found one that works any better, though. Maybe there is a federal safety standard on how hot they can be."
4,Might vary from user to user,"Pulled the trigger despite the number of ""this doesn't work"" reviews out there.Not clear if the issue is with specific units, the type of mug you use, or personal expectation on how hot you expect your drink to be, but this is working for me exactly as expected.I've got a giant ceramic mug that holds over half a liter of liquid. I've found that if I turn on the warmer when I go to make my drink, the drink stays hot enough for me to enjoy until I finish it, which this morning took about 45 minutes. Without the warmer, within 20 minutes, the drink was into the lukewarm stage.The drink wasn't as hot at the end as it was at the start, but it definitely was ""hot"" and not ""warm"".I did try using it to reheat a half-full cup at one point, and I definitely would have been better off taking 3 minutes to use the microwave, but even there, it managed to take the drink from room temperature to tepid.Count me in the ""it works for me"" column."
5,Mr. Coffee Mjg Beverage Warmer,"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer works as it should. Has a convenient on/off switch on the warmer, which is better than on the cord. Keeps coffee at the proper temperature."
3,Adequate for the price,"I've had this warmer for over a year now and while it keeps my tea warm, it goes nowhere near keeping it ""hot."" It's beginning to lose the black paint over the metal heating disc in the center, but remains serviceable. The price offers a decent value."
4,Pleased with my purchase,I have used the coffee warmer for several weeks now and I find that it keeps my coffee hot down to the last swallow. I would recommend this to others wanting a good working coffee warmer
1,one step above ice cold,dose not keep coffee hot a step above ice cold I was very disappointed I though since it was a Mr. coffee it would be what I wanted wouldn't not buy again.
3,Not. Hot enough,More heat I like my coffee hot! Not warm enough to keep coffee hot what more do you want to know?
4,"Good, but wish it was hotter","Good solid product, built well, good switch and cord. However, I like my tea/coffe HOT, and this keeps it marginally warm enough for me."
1,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer is a total waste of money. Only keeps drinks lukewarm at best. Not very satisfying at all.Mr Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer
3,Not the 'hottest' coffee warmer in the world....,"I researched 'coffee warmers' and noted the 'other' reviews but bought this anyway. Not a bad warmer....just not as hot as I would like it to be.If the coffee is really hot, it does an OK job.....but if the converse is true....it has a problem. Would I buy another? No, I would probably trya different brand. This is not to say that you 'wouldn't like it'. The price was right on and it got to me really fast. Try it, you might like it!"
1,Broke after 1 1/2 years,Used the warmer for almost two winters and it has stopped working now. Worked great during the first winter. They don't make them like they used to.
4,it's ok,"bought two for myhusband he thinks that it doesnt keep the coffee hot enough, but he likes it really hot"
4,mug warmer,Great Service & Item as described...this is a must for any person who likes hot drinks to stay hot while busy working.
1,Not even luke warm,"I almost knew this thing was going to be a hunk of crap from some of the reviews... but I figured I would see for myself. Yeah, this thing doesn't even keep liquid in a mug luke warm. It is junk. At least Amazon's return policy is 100% good-to-go."
1,Worked like a charm! FOR 5 MINUTES,"Really wanted this to work, but sadly disappointed. Literally worked for about 5 minutes and then stopped heating altogether. How difficult can it be to make such a device that actually works?"
1,Low Quality,"I make a very large mug of Tea in the morning. By the time I finish it, it is usually cold. I bought this thinking that it would allow me to have hot tea all morning.When I first got it the heat output was not too bad, it would keep something warm but wouldn't heat up something cold. That is for the 2 days it worked. Thats right, it only took 2 days before it gave out. Now it does not heat up at all. I have learned my lesson, buy a thermos."
4,warms mug of coffee,I got this to keep a cup of coffee warm and it does the job. I don't expect it to heat up anything. Two years of use and still going strong. Only 4 stars because the paint is wearing off. Seems more cosmetic than anything. Plus a plastic piece of the edge recently broke. A touch of glue fixed it and I expect it will continue do its job. It stays in one place and isn't subject to abuse or bumps etc so I was a bit taken aback by the piece breaking off.
5,I'm pleasantly surprised,"I wasn't expecting too much from this, but it actually kept my drink and mug really warm! I decided to give it a good test and I had hot tea in a taller mug and left it for several hours. The tea is still very warm! It's actually a perfect drinking temperature for me. I tend to drink slowly, and my drink always gets cold before I'm done, so I am very pleased with this mug warmer."
4,First one that actually works,"This is the second one I tried. It actually works. It does get really hot, though. I wouldn't want very young children too near it."
5,does the job,This warmer is exactly as advertised. Of course it won't warm cold water but it does keep beverages hot. I placed a mug of hot chocolate direct from the micro wave on the warmer and 2 1/2 hours later it was hotter than before. My wife loves it. She doesn't have to bug me to get up and heat her beverages anymore.
2,Mr. Coffee Warmer Not Too Hot,"The Mr. Coffee warmer does not produce enough heat to keep a beverage in a typical coffee mug warm. The wattage should be higher. In addition, earlier models had a somewhat higher wattage and an automatic shutoff if the cup was not lifted from the warmer for a period of time, approximately 10 minutes. When the cup was lifted, the timer would reset. Also, when the cup was lifted, the warmer would shut off until the cup was replaced on the warmer. The current model does not have either of these safety features. Once you turn the warmer on, it stays on until turned off with the manual switch on the warmer (if you remember to turn it off)."
4,Works well with a normal mug,Keeps drinks hot enough when used with a normal mug. Using an overly large mug seems to dissipate heat more. For best results I swirl the beverage when I take a sip to keep the temperature consistent inside.
2,Does not keep my beverage hot or even very warm,"Simply put, it does not keep my beverage hot or very warm. I've tried using different mugs and this thing is just not doing to the job. I read all the reviews before purchasing and gathered that I might have to try different mugs but that was not the case. The only reason I give it two stars is because it happens to keep my hot beverage warmer a bit longer (3 mins maybe?) than it would if I didnt have the warmer but in the end it cools down just the same. I would not purchase again."
3,A brief note on soundtrack influences...,"As noted by a previous reviewer, the title Big O song sounds a lot like Queen. That's because it IS Queen, not influenced by. That song is the title track ""Flash"" from the movie FLASH GORDON which Queen did the entire soundtrack for. That Queen wasn't credited for that song is plagarism, pure and simple.Other than that, the Big O soundtrack is great at creating the various moods during the show."
1,Boring and old,"I was eager to find a DVD that should show me how to sew! But I was dissappointed when I received my DVD. It was probably recorded way back in the 80s. I had really problems following the steps the Lady showed. I found it rather boring to watch, and it is still standing on my shelf, and I'm not sure, if I will ever watch it again. I would rather recommand a sewing class to someone, who wants to learn how to sew, than paying almost 50 $ like I did for this old and boring video. It's not worth the money!"
3,Good info,"For someone that wants a dane this book is complete with training info and pictures. It helps with how to take care of your dane and alerts you to the aliments danes are prone to. Great Danes are like gentle giants. For those of you that want one, but don't want to deal with house breaking and teething, there is a Great Dane rescue organizations with danes that are looking for good homes."
4,Easy but fun read!!!,"Mature adult here, didn't even realize when I grabbed this book that it was meant for teens... I can see how it would be appropriate for teens, but thoroughly enjoyed it! Easy to glide through (though I'm usually a pretty quick reader) but made for a very enjoyable weekend afternoon! I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy stories. A bit more simplistic (but not overly so) than many of the fantasy novels out there, but sometimes that's refreshing when your brain is tired. The primary characters are engaging, and the author makes you care about them quickly... all in all a fun read."
1,Defective Product,The product was delivered on time. When I inspected the bench I noticed one of the Upright Stanchions had improperly drilled holes to connect the Upright Cross Bar. Thus the bench was unusable. Called customer service for Phoenix health and Fitness INC. Hopefully they will be able to remedy the situations. Until then I just wasted my money.
2,Not too useful,"Although the logic sections of this book provide suffiecent tips, the math section lacked depth. I would not recommend this book as a primary soure, rather careful study of regular school curriculum should make you do well on this test. After all it is a test of what you have learned. Nothing prepares you more than keeping up regularly."
4,"If you like the movie, buy the CD!",A nice CD composed of the songs from the movie series Macross Plus.
3,Fundamental Liberal Policies.,"This book details what John Kenneth Galbraith views as a ""good society"" with what can be achieved and admitting there are goals that can't realistically be reached.Mr. Galbraith observed that the percentage of the poor that don't vote is mirrored by the high percentage of rich that do vote.His view on wealth and power was insightful- ""Power serves the acquisition of income; income accords power over the pecuniary reward of others."" Page 65.His assessment of corporate greed was almost prophetic-""Personal profit maximization, that universally acclaimed motivation, can and does extend to those who effectively head the firm."" Page 17.The downside with this book from one of my favorite authors on the subject of economics is the age of it.A lot has transpired in the world of politics, global business, and economics since this book was published in 1997.The book does serve very well as a primer on liberal economics."
1,One episode cannot define a season,"Smallville season 9 is downright the worst season of Smallville. The plot is not interesting at all. The plot of Smallville has really gone downhill. However, the finale episode showed great promise. I believe that where smallville really got messed up, was when Micheal Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) wanted to leave the show. In my opinion ""Lex Luthor"" was a big reason why the first 5-7 seasons of Smallville where so good. I think if the producers could convince Rosenbaum to come back, that would turn the show around.Overall, I thought season 9 of Smallville just was not very good, however, I have hopes that the 10th (and final) season will be great!"
4,The stakes are getting even higher,"Things have heated up far beyond dealing with Lex and Lionel and even with Lana. Now, Clark, Chloe, Lois, and Oliver must face Zod and the remaining Kandorians, as well as a shadowy group called Checkmate, in a battle for control of the Earth and peace and freedom for its inhabitants.Clark's mom shows up briefly, as do members of the Justice League. And the red-blue blur makes quite a few appearances around town.Things will be wrapping up in season 10. Can't wait!"
5,Smallville season 9,I'm a huge fan and I really enjoy this series. It is definately in my top 3 tv shows. I ordered this for my brother so he could enjoy the adventure as well.
1,LAME,"Ok, so they had a good thing going for a while with the super villains in season eight, but rather than actually finishing a story line, they drop it and start over with something else. LAME"
3,Truth or Legend?,Are you looking for perfect Hollywood entertainment with breathtaking stunts in the air and handsome actors? Go for this video straight away!!! Would you rather know more about the life and times of Manfred von Richthofen and what really happened the day he died? Are you more interested in well- researched movies and historical correctness? Then leave it.
4,I'm stuck on Moonstruck,"This is a delightful romantic comedy. Cher does a wonderful job of changing from a frumpy, overworked fiancee to a glamorous, sexy girlfriend of Nicholas Cage. Good performances by everyone."
2,Moonstruck,"This being my all time favorite movie, I bought this DVD as a backup to one I already have. I was not so impressed as the main menu was different (look and music) and the contents indicated on the back cover of this ""deluxe edition"" were not there (recepies, etc) I fail to see what is so ""deluxe"" about it. I will always recommend this movie but maybe not the ""deluxe edition"" because it is nothing special. I also had problems starting it (I initially thought something was wrong with my DVD player. . .haven't watched it again as my original version is much better."
3,Why only Full Screen?,Love the film. But why is it only available in Full Screen format? That's pretty annoying.
1,dull and not funny,"i have always been a fan of romantic comedies, and i've even been able to enjoy formulaic ones such as the wedding planner and it could happen to you, but this movie is just too awful. the acting is atrocious and cher is just way too old for the part (is she supposed to look fifty?). personally i love nicholas cage but there is nothing appealing about his character in this movie and the thick black hair all over his body certainly doesn't help.none of this would have annoyed me greatly had the lines in this movie not been so hokey and badly delivered. i think i laughed, at most, twice, which is sad since i am easily amused if the lines are halfway witty. if you rent this movie you probably won't die from sheer mortification that such a bad movie could be made, but Moonstruck is certainly not a good enough movie to buy!"
5,WHY IS THIS NOT AVAILABLE IN WIDESCREEN????,"This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I have the laserdisc, but I will not upgrade to DVD unless it's widescreen. Every other good movie from 1987 (a bumper crop year) is available in this format. Please, please, please, do this little thing!"
1,Great Movie -- Junk DVD,"Nothing is more irritating than seeing the message: ""this movie has been altered from its orignal theatrical presentation. It has been reformatted to fit your screen"" when your watching it on a WIDESCREEN TV and you END UP WITH BLACK BARS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT! How arrogent of them to assume that ""your screen"" will always be an old-fashioned 4:3 format TV!!This may be the only DVD I can think of that isn't available in widescreen. Save your money and spend it on a product produced by people with more regard for their customers."
5,"Please please please, distributors : WIDESCREEN","This is one of my favorite movies, but I won't convert to the DVD version until widescreen. As so many of us have already complained, ""what were you people thinking?????"""
5,A Superb Meal of Love,"This is a wonderful film to watch with a girlfriend, wife or woman you are interested in. Why? It is passionate, funny, romantic, lunatic, sweet and truthful. Cher has never been a performer I cherish, or even admire, but here is the best work I've seen her in. She is beautiful and excellent in the part. Nic Cage is also excessive in the most melodramatic, stereotypical Italian way, a way which this film mines toward gold. Olympia Dukakis owns all the scenes she is in, and with Vincent Gardinia, the two make for a beautiful and interesting couple. It isn't long, boring or dumb. Highly recommended."
4,Moonstruck,"I like watching this movie especially with the big name talent in this film. Cher was wonderful and a young Nicholas Cage was entertaining as well. The look into old Italian family was nastalgic and comfy, and the music was wonderfuly supportive of the atmosphere. PG 13 easy not bad language, no nude scenes, focus on the story and plot which moved forward at a good pace."
5,You will laugh and cry with joy....,"A ""feel good movie"" if ever there were one...Funny and Romantic...some great supporting actors other than Cher and Cage. A movie to invite a couple over to your house for ""dinner and a movie""..."
5,Great characters,"The movie has wonderful characters, well played. Every one of them. The story line of finding and maintaining loving relationships within a loyal family is quite special."
5,moonstuck,This is one of the best films of all time. the cast is supurb Cher is brilliant and what can I say about Olyumpia DucarKis but fabulas the whole film is brilliant Watch it and if you don't agree with me then there is something wrong with You!Yours FaithfullyShaun Warburton
1,no track listings,"I WOULD LOVE TO RATE & PURCHASE THIS CD BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS THE TWO SONGS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR. IF YOU COULD HELP ME, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT."
4,"Out of date, but good!!","A bit out of date; soooo funny, because I don't think I'll be using words and phrases like ""typewriter"" or ""will you close the porthole"" although it's charming to see. It's very helpful however, and I'm excited to have it!!"
4,A good book about the Holy Spirit,"Another good book by Billy Graham. I recommend you to read it. I agree with most of what Dr Graham is saying about the Holy Spirit but regarding ""speaking in tounges"" I disagree with him. I think it is for every believer and for edification of the induvidual believer. I also think he is to unclear about the need of baptism. I see nothing in the bible to support child baptism and think he should put more effort on making it clear that every believer fist should repent from their sins and receive the Lord Jesus and then be baptised in water.But otherwise it is a very good book."
5,A necessity in every sense,"Some facts about Harold Bloom. He taught himself to read English (his family spoke Yiddish at home) at the age of 3 or 4. He has a photographic memory for text, and has more or less the whole canon of English poetry committed to memory.Now granted, these facts don't guarantee genius by themselves, but Bloom has something extra to add to those other traits--an imaginative hunger and an enormous love for poetry and what it can do for the individual, sensitive reader.Admittedly, this analysis of Blake owes quite a bit to Northrop Frye's ""Fearful Symmetry,"" but there are many new insights that make this book worth much more than its price. Whatever one may think about Bloom's later literary analyses, his early work has, undeniably, the stamp of genius."
3,Why did they have to change a good thing?,"I have to agree with other reviewers, I just don't get why they changed the diapers to be so crunchy and chemical smelling. I had not planned on using Pampers but we were given pampers in the hospital and loved them and decided it was worth the extra to stick with them. But going to try others. If you like these new stinky pampers, Amazon has consistently had the best price."
3,Just an Average Diaper....,"This is a good diaper for the most part. I do like that they are thin so they don't take up much room in the diaper bag, nor do they make my child's rear end ""puffy"". I do, however, have an issue with them overnight. I suppose my baby is a heavy wetter compared to most, or at least I'm assuming, because she wakes up soaked every morning. I change right before I lay her down and that diaper is SO full and leaking. Very unhappy with that, but I don't know what else to do."
5,You got to try them!!!,Love Pampers Baby Dry..I use them for both my 1 and 2 year olds and it works great. I never had a leak problem or any rashes!!
5,I won't use anything else!,"As a first-time mom I found that all my friends used Pampers on their children, so naturally I decided to use Pampers as well and I love them! The Baby Dry diapers are thin, fit great and do not leak. I was given another brand of diapers at my baby-shower and we do not like them at all. In fact, we still have a partially unused package because we'd rather pay for the superior quality of Pampers than deal with the leakage from the free diapers."
1,Does not keep your baby dry,"So I bought these diapers because I have used the Swaddlers before with success. My daughter is 9 weeks old, 10 pounds and uses size 1. For anyone that has not used Swaddlers, the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner, almost paper thin. Upon the first use of this diaper, I noticed that after a 2 hour nap, my daughter's onesie was was wet. I gave the diaper another chance, and had exactly the same issue. I would not recommend this diaper as I believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry."
4,No more leaks,"These baby dry diapers live up to their name. We used to use Luvs and Huggies and our little guy had us changing the sheets sometimes 2 or more times per day. Since changing to Pampers Baby Dry diapers, we only change the sheets when they get dirty. What a concept. It may sound like a small thing, but it's not one to overlook.(Did that sound like too much of a commercial? Oh well, it's early...)"
5,Great product for the price,Have been buying diapers for all my grandchildren and by far Pampers Baby Dry have been the best buy for the price. No compliants only good feed back from the parents.
5,Best Available Disposables,"I have four children and have tried all the available disposables, including other Pampers diapers. I love Pampers Baby Dry the best. I do not have leak issues and by using the Amazon Subscribe and Save method they are also very economical for me."
2,These diapers don't do their job.,"These diapers have a design flaw. When my baby has a BM, a small amount seeps through the diaper so I put two of these on so her clothes do not get messy."
2,What happened pampers?,"I've been diapering babies for the last 12 years straight and have always loved pampers. My kids are sensitive to other brands so I have to use the name brands and pampers never lets me down. Until this box. I have purchased this brand/size/box count before (months ago) with no problems but for some reason every single diaper in this last box leaks. He is soaking wet every time I put one on him. It doesn't matter if he's awake or asleep he's soaked through his onesie, shirt, and pants as soon as he goes. It's almost as if there's nothing absorbant in there. The urine leaks through the entire outside cover. I thought maybe it was the baby at first so I kept using them but after switching back to cruisers and another name brand in the same size no leaks at all. Now I have a huge box of expensive diapers I can't use. Not happy!"
2,Pampers diapers - have they changed???,"I was tired of the tabs on luvs and decided to go back to pampers, but when I tried both the cruisers and baby dry diapers this time around, they both gave my little guy diaper rash (they didn't do that a year and a half ago). The baby dry didn't do it as bad as the cruisers. I love pampers products - both the baby dry diapers and the cruisers as well (great fit, quality product), but they are useless if they give your little one diaper rash. Otherwise, amazon does a great job delivering their product."
5,Great Diapers for my baby,Pampers diapers are excellent for the babies who are sensitive to the diaper rash. they worked well on my baby skin.
3,Average diapers - better options on the market,"I only use these because I've gotten a huge supply for free. The construction of these diapers seem flimsy compared to Seventh Generation (best diapers) and Huggies Little Movers. Every time my little one pees, they fill up like soggy water balloons. They also smell extra funky when they're peed and of course pooped. I don't mean like just poop, but like poop and artificial scent mixed together. Not a good combo. My little used to get terrible butt rash from Pampers Swaddlers, but these don't give her any rashes. For the price, they're not that bad. I think they are an OK value, just know that there are better options if price isn't the priority."
1,Terrible.,"Well I'm not sure what Pampers has done but these baby dry diapers are awful. My son has been in Huggies for a long time and I thought we would give these a try since the price is a pretty good deal through Amazon. I'm sorry I did. These are VERY thin diapers and the quality is extremely poor. These are definitely not the baby dry diapers I used on my older son a few years ago. These are completely white, no design at all. They used to have cute Sesame Street designs on them. The sides are not very stretchy and the diaper easily gets pushed down by clothing. We have had leaking at night because of this. Also, when the diaper has been on for a while (like at night) it's like the diapers shreds a bit around the leg openings. I assume this is due to rubbing against clothing for extended periods of time. I will NOT be buying these again. I'm sorry I bought such a big box since most of these will go to waste. Pampers Cruisers however, are great."
1,causes diaper rash... i returned it,They caused diaper rash. I changed to Huggies and they were gone. We have used pampers over last 6 years for my kids but i will never use Baby -Dry again.
5,cheapest price,"When using the subscribe and save, it is the cheapest price than all the stores I checked. (walmart, Target, Babiesrus)"
1,Not good for baby bums,"I bought these when they were a killer deal. I have a 4 month old and I have never used this brand before. BAD MISTAKE! They ended up giving my little girl a burn-like rash on her bottom and I only used 2 of them. It took almost a week for it to go away after I switched back to huggies. It was NOT a diaper rash, it was way worse, it happened almost instantly after I started use. I would not recommend to anyone. After I returned these (can I just say Amazon has the best customer service EVER!!!) I read reviews of other moms on different websites and it seems like I am not the only one this has happened too."
1,late shipping!!!,"Placed an order on 09/08/04, today is 10/08/04.I've been waiting for 1 month already and it still has not been shipped!!!Are you challenging the customers' patience???"
5,Work just as well as the more expensive options--maybe better,"I used to buy Pampers Cruisers for my son, perhaps thinking if they cost more they must work better. Who knows. Then Cruisers added the Dry Max and my son started getting a rash. Thank goodness, becuase I switched to these diapers and realized they work just as well, are significantly cheaper, and don't have the perfume that caused the rash. Just a note: they do seem to run slightly smaller than Cruisers and Swaddlers when you order the same size."
4,good,"Exelente I love these diapers. They work well with my daughter. No leaks here! But I used to buy them on the Subscribe and Save program, and that's no longer available. Now the price at Amazon is just as high as anywhere else. I am upset that it's not a good deal anymore."
3,Just ok.....,I love pampers but for some reason these ones leak all the time!I have to change my son twice a day because his diapers would leak. Switching to a different brand.
5,LOVE,I love pampers and this was a good buy. I would buy again if needed to but my little one now is potty trained.
2,"Baby is not dry in Baby Dry, Prefer Swaddlers","I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for my son (now 13 months old) and highly recommend THIS brand of Pampers. My goal was to order the same brand from Amazon but the only brand available on Amazon was Pampers Baby Dry diapers so I decided to give it a try, because after all, it is still made by Pampers, a name I trust. I do NOT recommend Baby Dry diapers. My son would stay dry in the Swaddlers but ironically he was soaking wet in the Baby Dry diapers. The diaper does not hold the wetness which would become saggy once wet and leak up the front, so he would be wet all over, in his diaper, his pjs, and his bedding, overnight in this diaper. He also developed more diaper rashes from wearing this diaper compared to the other one. I love the delivery service Amazon provides, but I will not get Baby Dry again."
2,Pampers Baby Dry,I am not a fan of the pampers baby dry. I have a 16 month old and when the diaper gets wet it starts to sag in the bottom to the point where it looks funny and I am sure is uncomfortable for her. The fact that she is such a mover I think makes this not a great diaper for her age. The pamper cruisers are great and that is what she is wearing now. Before I could not decide between the baby dry size 5 and the cruisers size 5 because I really didn't know what the difference was and now I do! The fit!
5,great value and fit,I got a great deal with the Subscribe & Save option and coupon codes! Pampers Baby Dry diapers fit great and are less bulky so work well with tights.
1,"Terrible, Leaky, Useless Diapers","We couldn't be more disappointed with these diapers. We bought them for our 20-month old daughter to wear at nighttime and not once have they kept her dry. They leak through the front, the legs, the back, you name it. Really poor quality and they've put us off Pampers for life. Stay away."
4,Good Product,Got here a few days later than expected but Ive used Pampers for awhile. NOT good for little babies but GREAT for toddlers. NOT a good fit but much more absorbent than Huggies. I reccomend Huggies for up to 18 mos. about 12 mos and up i reccomend pampers
5,"Great Diapers, Great Price","I used to be a fan of Luvs but then they changed their materials and now they feel very plasticy rather than cloth-like. I like these diapers because they feel nearly cloth like, which if you are a new parent, that means they BREATHE and that reduces the amount of Diaper Rashes that your child might have.With the Amazon Mom pricing you get 30% off which makes these a steal. Whenever I run out before I received my new shipment, I always have sticker shock at the prices. In my neighborhood store, a 30pk are almost 11$ and that's the average."
1,These diapers leak!,"I've used Pampers Cruisers and Pull-ups and both work great...but these Baby Dry Pampers are awful. They leak probably once a day. I've never had this experience before with other diapers which hold the wetness much better. I will be shopping for a different kind. This is ridiculous, no way should they leak as much as they do...very frustrating."
4,Pampers Baby Dry,"This is the first time we dried anything other than snugglers or swaddlers. Definitely a great price. Lasted us more than two months. So far, after one month of usage, their haven't been any leaks or blow outs. They fit our fairly small son well enough. No rashes or reactions either."
4,Sizing information,"Great product, but it would be helpful if the brand could post sizing info (eg. size 2 = 10 to 16 lbs).Thanks"
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased the Pampers Baby Dry by mistake and I hated them. They leak and they are hard. Pampers Swaddlers are excellent they NEVER leak, they are soft and comfortable for my baby boy. Stick with the Swaddlers or you'll not only be changing the babies diaper more often but you'll be changing the babies clothes and bedding too."
3,i prefer Huggies,i bought these to try since they were a little cheaper than Huggies. I usually use basic Huggies. I find that these diapers feel cheaper than the Huggies. I will use this box up and then move back to the Huggies. Note that these diapers haven't leaked through. i just think that the Huggies are a better built diaper. These Pampers may be fine for most.
5,Love!,"great quality, great price, never leaks, no blowouts = win!We only purchase pampers diapers now. The cute pattern of sesame street is nice to have, the tabs are soft and easily visable (pale green) rather than having to look for them, they're obvious. These smell good and stack well. We are big fans"
1,"""Baby Dry"" makes baby ""wet""","I have been using the Pampers Swaddlers for 8 months but decided to try the ""Baby Dry"" because of the reviews and price. What a mistake!!! Do not get these. Every morning, my son wakes up completely wet......leaving the sheets & mattress cover wet too. When the diaper gets wet, the moisture does not lock away from the baby....and the diaper gets weighed down. They are awful! I just wish I didn't order the 222 count. I am stuck with these for awhile."
2,Not great for newborns.,"I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home."
3,Okay Diaper,"This diaper normally does the job but occasionally will leak in the mornings.My 14 month old son's pajamas will be damp in the front. Also,an issue I have been having,are the tabs will sometimes break off. This is a waste of a whole diaper.I have wasted about 10-15 diapers in a pack due to this."
5,Amazon is crafty and nauseous,"When I reorder the product through Amazon's Subscribe & Save Section. I can't imput the extra 20% off promotion code when checking out. And the system placed order for me right now. Couple minutes later, I figure out the way to use the coupon by setting up a new order through Subscribe & Save Section and I place a new order which will save 20% for me. However, I find the previous order by the system can not be cancelled while the new cheaper order can be modefied. Just several minutes! The only thing I can do is to cancel the later, the cheaper one. Amazon is so smart and nauseous."
2,Not great!,I'm disappointed in these diapers. My daughter frequently wakes up in the morning covered in clumps of gel from inside the diaper. It's not hurting anything but it's a pain to clean up.
4,Better than huggies!,"Much better than huggies diapers. They hold liquid better and fit my 27lb daughter much better as well. She's almost 2 so hopefully around then we'll go to either pullups or real underwear then. In the meantime though... we'll stick with these. I've tried Luvs and I've tried huggies.... and for whatever reason neither of them fit our daughter particularly well. She's on the tall but slender side so while even the size 3 diapers would fit her a the waist, they don't come up high enough to really be effective. Add in that these hold way more liquid than the size 4 diapers.... and we're doing good."
1,"Leaks a lot! Keeps baby really messy, not dry and clean!!","I hate these diapers! Always leaks even at day time! Poop would always come out, as in every time my son poops! Whenever we go out i make sure my son has 2-3 sets of xtra clothes coz he is always messed up! Im sooo disappointed in pampers! I eould rather use cheap brands or rather switch back to my trusted huggies diapers."
2,Baby dry is not as good as swaddlers,I was a new mom and therefore pretty tired. I didn't notice that there was a difference between baby dry and swaddlers and accidentally bought baby dry. They are more plastic and didn't seem to let my baby's skin breathe nearly as well as the swaddlers. I won't buy the baby dry again!
3,I like swaddlers better,These diapers are great but I do prefer swaddlers version. They are not as soft as the swaddlers but aside from that they get the job done.
1,Leaks and full of strong chemicals,"I was trying to save money by going with these instead of some of the natural diapers (a few cents more per diaper) but I quickly regretted it. I've never had leaks with the natural diapers but these leaked every night. Little gooey balls came out of the diapers and stuck to my daughter's skin whenever they got wet, which I didn't like either. I was so relieved when the natural diapers I ordered to replace these arrived, and I will never use these again!!"
3,Not for tall babies,"My son is 22 pounds but has already outgrown size 4 Pampers diapers in height. Although the description says the diapers are good until 28 pounds. I ordered the next size 5 but in height they are almost identical to size 4, they are just made to accomodate more weight. So we will be switching to Huggies, in Huggies he still fits into size 4 with some room to grow!Meanwhile we used Pampers for 3 months and they were great. Almost no accidents, soft to the touch, smells powdery but not overpowering and price through amazon can not be beat. I just wish they took taller babies into consideration!"
4,Much better than Swaddlers,Baby Dry diapers are much better than Swaddlers. I can't stand the chemical smell of the new Swaddlers (with Dry Max) and didn't want my baby to have to smell it all day. Baby Dry is a good alternative. The adhesive taps are not as secure as Huggies diapers.
1,"""Baby Dry"" but Covered with Poop","After hitting the end of the line with Pampers Swaddlers, which max out in a size 2-3, we figured ""Baby Dry"" was the logical next step. *Every* time our daughter pooped it came right up the back and on to her outfit, her mother, the sofa--you name it. She is right in the size range. We will *not* be buying this diaper again."
2,Not worth it,"I tried these because I used Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers in the past and liked them (before switching to 7th Generation diapers temporarily because of concerns over my baby's skin sensitivity). The price enticed me to buy these, and I was really disappointed. They felt cheap and the performance was poor. LOTS of leaking, in my opinion. Her sheets and clothes all smelled like urine continuously. I couldn't wait to get rid of them. I bought Cruisers in the same size to replace them, and they were a lot bigger. Just an opinion, but to me I'd rather pay more for diapers that work better."
4,Great deal,Excellent deal from amazon on Pampers diapers. Free shipping. Fast delivery. Will order more in the future.
2,There is a reason for cheaper price,"Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter, baby dry was okay. You just have to change often though."
5,The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!,These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
2,Not good for overnight... or even a few hours sometimes,"The price was nice but the performance is lacking. Our son can soak one of these full in a few hours and has more leaks with these. We don't dare use these overnight and just use them during the day (We use Huggies Snug & Dry Size 3 at night). Even during daytime use, he still will leak once in a while with these. It might be partly a sizing issue since these are larger than the equivalent 3 in the Huggies. We won't be getting these again after this pack runs out."
2,Problems with leaks and fastening,"We only used 5 of these diapers with our newborn, and we had problems with 4 of the diapers. Two leaked poop or urine. One had the fastner break. One had the fastener repeatedly detach.We had no problems with Pampers Swaddlers, so we will switch back to that diaper type. Perhaps, this diaper type will work better at the higher size."
1,Disappointed to say the least,"After using a different type of Pampers, we purchased these. My 10 week old premie has had numerous blow-outs in these diapers. His clothes end up wet often and they feel much cheaper material than Pampers Swaddlers. I definitely won't purchase Baby Dry diapers again!"
5,super great! Never leak for my Little guy.,"I love Pampers. They never leak for us.He leaked out of every other diapers we tried and with Amazon Mom, these are a better price than the store brands anyway."
2,Too Pricey!,"We purchased these for awhile because they were the only diapers that would stand up to the ""blowouts"" but let me tell you the Target brand diapers are the same quality for SOOOO much less $ If I had any advice for people getting Pampers or Huggies it would be try Target brand they are the best I promise you won't be disappointed. Don't try Kroger or Kmart brands or anything similar just Target. Only if someone told us this a year ago we'd have a Ferrari by now with all the money we saved after switching!"
5,Great deal!,This is a great item and is shipped quickly to my house and I never have to worry about going to the store to pick up diapers. Amazon is the best!!
4,Pampers Baby Dry,"I loved the quantity and the feel of the diaper. It's soft and not as bulky as others. Pampers are my favorite. I noticed, however, the Baby Dry ones seemed to leak more up the back and out the legs than the other Pampers products. It is almost like this type was not as absorbant. I think a lot would have been prevented if they had the net on the back to catch if anything goes up the back."
