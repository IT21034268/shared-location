3,They work ok,"They helped a little, but no more than other heal cushions I've used. Not sure they are worth the extra money."
3,review,the product is amazing help to my heel spurs and plantar faciitis. just wish i had purchased more in the first place. thank you for wonderful service.
1,Did not help!!,"This product did not help my feet at all, if anything it made my condition worse. I have been suffering with debilitating Plantar Fasciitis for over a year and probably put too much trust in this product. My opinion was that it was a waste of money as it made my feet feel worse instead of better. My recommendation is if you are suffering with the same thing I am do not buy this product and actually buy the right kind of shoes that your doctor suggest for you."
2,Hard to Tell,"Hard to tell whether these heel cups work. Since my heels have not shown much improvement after wearing these several times, I guess I'd say it does not make much difference. Also tightens up shoe fits which is not so comfortable."
4,Heel Pads,"I used these for plantar faschitis that developed after a fractured ankle and they eleviated discomfort. After a couple years and plenty of vigorous site seeing activity, they were no longer needed."
4,Great music...wrong CD!,I love the Blind Boys and when I heard their version of Motherless Child on the radio I purchased this CD. Well the music is great but none of the songs listed on the label or the case are on the CD. This is a great CD but I have no idea which one it actually is and I still would like to have the one with Motherless Child.
5,The best way to get these concertos for the left hand,"This CD is in sparkling sound, with a particularly warm, non-perussive piano. As one earlier reviewer notes, Fleisher doesn't strive to generate the utmost excitement here; the Ravel and Prokofiev readings therefore don't have the fire they could. But these three odd concertos have been given the deluxe treatment by a great orchestra under Ozawa's skilled rather than inspiring conducting.This month (Nov. 2005) The Gramophone picked the Zimerman/Boulez version of the Ravel left-hand concerto on DG as the best in the catalog, but that recording features duller conducitng and sound, a slightly more involved pianist, and a coupling with the Ravel G major Concerto, of which most collectors already own several other satisfying versions. Considering its unusual program, the present Sony CD is a better buy at mid-price."
1,save your time and money,this game blows gta driver halo 2 hell shrek game is better then this lol i say dont even rent it the only thang good about this game is the soundtrack which could have been better it the worst game to ever hit the shelves the gameplay sucks the storylice sucks and im so fed of those few people who say this is better then gta they are a BIG jackass and once again the only good thing on it is the music and if u dont like rap but you think this game looks cool you better turn the music OFF!!!!! man i just cant stand this game this shiet the only other good thing about this game is that you can be snoop dogg but anyways this game sucks(...).
4,"Fun, but.....","True Crime Streets of L.A. is fun , action packed, lets get to the problem.For the first thing,there is a radio in the car like in gta3,and gta:vc,I have never heard the""f-word"" in a game,except this one!!When it said strong language, I never imagined......So if your parents are sticklers with language(like mine)you have the choice to turn yhe music down in options.The controls are not like the GTA series though.The game is fun but watch the language.Im 12 and im appauled by it.If not for the language the game would get a 4.8.I didnt think activision was capable,but oh well.Note:just keep the MUSIC VOLUME down.Thats how I convinced my parents."
3,gtawannabe,this game is more of a step down from vice city than it is a step up.the controls are better but the environment is the same.
2,LOL at this game,Sheesh the game was so easy I beat it in one day. The gameplay sucked! It even allows you to skip some levels. Pass on this game.
4,4 out of 5,This game is for when all you wanna do is bullshlt for a bit.. mad fun to play as snoop dogg
2,Disappointing.,"It stinks. 'Nough said. This book drags and goes nowhere when you think it was starting to. Carlota doesn't even ride that ""majestic stallion"" anywhere. She rides some other horse, and the book just ends after she's just announced she's tooken over her fathers ranch (who just died). blah blah. Bland, nothing to it."
2,Amused To Death - bored to tears,"Roger Waters has to pull to side of the pretentiousness highway right now. What was he thinking? A track featuring Marv Albert (""Yes""!, that one) with a play by play a an oil rig being blown up? Pul-eease! Good production, but dull songs. Only for the die-hard fans."
5,Roger Waters at his best,"After seeing Roger Waters performing several songs from ""Amused"" live in Manchester 22/6/02 only underlines what a fantastic album this is.He is without doubt one of the best music writers of the last couple of decades.For me the stand out tracks are""Perfect Sense 1&2"",""The Bravery of being out of Range"",""Three Wishes"",""It's a Miracle"" & ""Amused To Death"".Roger Waters stands out as a fine musician & lyricist and only goes to show what Pink Floyd are now missing as he was the driving force behind the band,although David Gilmour is a fantastic guitar player (one of the best ever)and a fine songwriter they were both when combined together a fantastic partnership(one can only hope)!!!!"
2,Not that amusing at all,"This album seems to try to harken back to the ""big"" sound and ambition of the last two Pink Floyd albums. Unfortunately it stumbles out of the gate. Unlike ""Pros and Cons"" and ""KAOS,"" the musical efforts here are rudimentary and heavy handed. The lyrics are mostly muttered, and for the most part extremely caustic and bitter - this may have been what some fans were waiting for, but unless you thought ""The Final Cut"" was the best Pink Floyd album I'd approach this with caution. As this was effectively the last Roger Waters album, it seems like he had run out of gas at this point and realized it."
5,"Let the ""movie"" begin... let it move you","Ah, what a fantastic album this is. A wonderful, powerful concept album that is everything I know and love about Pink Floyd albums, without Pink Floyd, of course. Ex-Pink Floyd singer/songwriter delivers a powerful album that is more like a movie - Raw, emotional, moving. This is a great continuation of Roger Water's finer masterpieces... Dark Side and The Wall. A genuine, heartfelt experience and it is, I believe, his best solo work to date. Roger Waters is an incredibly compassionate human being. This album is filled with songs that are beautiful, thought provoking, and terrifying - sometimes, all at once. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd's work and Roger's, I suggest you give ""In the Flesh"" a listening... it is a great live album showcasing highlights of both Roger's solo songs and Pink Floyd songs, wonderfully."
5,Waters is a lyrical/musical genius,"I was slow to accept Roger Waters as a solo act as I felt him most responsible for my favorite bands undoing. I recently downloaded a few of his solo works, desperate for some ""Floyd"" sounding music, and can't believe how ""Amused"" totally blew me away.I had almost forgotten how Waters' concepts, music and voice mesh together so perfectly to bring life to his ideas. The sound-scapes he creates fit in impeccably and really bring a familiar Waters style to Amused that should be listened to straight through to be appreciated. Download the lyrics, sit back with some headphones and prepare to experience another fantastically profound and mind- expanding offering from Waters' genius mind.Hopefully this is not his last concept solo album ..."
5,"Waters ""was"" Floyd","The poetic genius of Pink Floyd ""was"" Roger Waters as evinced in this his latest album. Gilmour's limited number of riffs have grown quite stale and he quickly ran out of concepts in the abscence of Waters. Here ,however, on Amused, Roger continues to push the envelope of higher social thought.TPOH once said, ""Raising consciousness as a social tool"" and Roger does it quite well.As with Roger's other albums ,this one also needs to be listened to at one setting for full effect and not broken into it's components. Insightful, his best yet. If you were a true Pink Floyd fan you can't go wrong adding this to your collection. Bravo Mr. Waters!"
4,Sublime Lyrical and Musical Journey,"This album is by far Roger's best in my opinion (although Pros and Cons with Clapton on six strings was also a strong album). He could not have chosen a better lead guitarist than Beck who compliments well the dark and sometimes humorous meanderings of Roger Waters. There are many strong individual tracks with ""It's a miracle"" being the best. On initial hearing I didn't think much of this CD but after hearing it several times whilst driving on a long country road trip in Australia it grew on me. Listening to Waters's musical work is a great test of someone's general attitude to life. The depressive and dark images painted by Waters do have a hidden content of hope and humour in them. A purely negative person will not see the hidden light but dwell on the superficial dark aspects of the music. Great CD for pink floyd fans and non pink floyd fans alike 4.5 stars"
5,Classic Waters,"In Roger's most recent solo effort he again takes a jab at modern society as he displays a pessimistic view of our demise. In this album he attacks television, war as entertainment(following the Persian Gulf War), and organized religion. In ""What God Wants"" Roger details how world religions have used god's name to justify their actions. He attacks television and war in songs like ""Too Much Rope"", ""Watching TV"" and ""Perfect Sense"". The album ends on a sour note with the human race ""amusng itself to death"". The poor points of this album are the places where Roger takes s personal shots at certain people, including Nick Mason, Bob Ezrin, Stanley Kubrick, and Andrew Lloyd Weber. Despite this it is a truly great work."
3,A REACTION TO THE STATESQUE,"its..a good book..it tells alot about whats going on behind..the sences..however, there is alot of exageration..in it. the princess didnt distiguish..between..how women r treated between diffenrt places of saudi arabia. for ppl in te west..alhijaz area..have differnt ways..in dealing with those isuues..i mean..the relations between men and women..r more respectful. also, in Njad the young generation has changed alot..and what was happenening to the princess..was not general. c prince abdullah fo rexample. hes openminded young prince. the thing i really didnt like in the book is that cause of the stories happenend in her life, the princess got a negative rection from religion..and traditions."
2,Simpering and somewhat unbelievable,"I read the first book and was appalled (although not surprised) at the treatment of women even within the wealthiest of households in Saudi Arabia. In fact, I read all 3 (because my Kindle makes it easy to just keep going!) - and by the time I got to the end of the trilogy and found the tone so saccharin and phony that I couldn't finish the third book. Princess Sultana emerges as a spoiled princess with an artificial sense of her own enlightenment."
5,Princess Saltanas Daughters,Amazing look into a world that we know little about. I now appreciate my freedom as a woman even more.
5,Perahia is a great one,"I will review mainly the sonata, which is the reason I bought this disc. I remember my old recording of the same sonata with Zoltan Kocsis on LP and, then being very young, I was enamored by his playing and with the Brahms effect which makes everyone ask themselves `do you like Brahms?' Of course that was not the right feeling if you want to hear the Music Brahms wrote and I you are that kind of person who is appealed by effects and even more cheap glitter wrapped in first class pianism than you should get the recording of Zimerman.Perahia through his stronghold of good taste (if he even needs it), offers truthful interpretation (though at that point it obliterates itself) and cold sophistication that Brahms's music needs. Only when the most pure allure and almost ascetic frankness of this magnificent music is achieved then the feelings (your own!!!) start to flow and Mr. Perahia allows it in a most humbly manner.Metod SIRONIC"
5,The Perfect Solution!,"I looked for quite a while at butter dishes before I discovered this particular butter dish at Amazon.com. After reading a number of reviews, I was convinced that this butter dish had all the characteristics I was looking for. Examples: Unbreakable, seals well (no other odors absorbed) and, if butter were to melt, will prevent butter from running all over the place. When my order arrived, I was delighted to see that it was just what I expected, and I immediately put it to use."
2,Not airtight; Doesn't seal,"Unlike most tupperware, this butter dish doesn't seal at all---in fact, it leaves a gap large enough for ants to crawl through. Beware if you plan on using this to hold butter at room temperature.Better isProgressive Butter Keeper Dish With Measure Grid, which has a rubber seal---and is big enough to fit any butter stick sold in U.S."
3,"Great for the price, but...","I was at first thrilled that the red color matches my red dishes - and at such a low price! The actual matching dish from Fiesta would have been around 40 bucks. But alas, it turns out that you get what you pay for. I keep my butter in the fridge, so it is hard. And since this dish is fairly slim, fitting the butter stick exactly, I hit the edges of the dish with my knife when getting butter. Slice, hit, slice, hit. Unfortunately, the butter knife hits are showing in the plastic, which is too soft to handle the impact. Shame. I love it otherwise."
2,Not very good,"I just wanted a basic butter dish with a lid that snaps on. That's pretty much what I got, but the lid doesn't stay on. I can't tell you how many times I've taken it out of my cabinet, only to have it fall upside down (of course) on the counter, while leaving the lid in my hand. Would not recommend."
2,Not functional,"It is so hard to find a functional butter dish, a dish in which the butter does not sit in a well.I want to be able to cut down to the bottom of the dish and extract a pad of butter.But this dish has a raised border around the bottom that does not allow this."
3,Hey! come on.....,It's just a butter dish.....It holds butter....looks nice and.....oh yea....it holds butter too!....How can you write a serious review on a butter dish?......It does the job very well and looks fine on the kitchen counter......?
1,Not Tupperware...,I was expecting the name brand tupperware but got Rubbermaid which I could have purhcased anywhere...
2,This is a Rubbermaid??,"We've come to expect better quality from Rubbermaid branded products. The lid doesn't fit correctly due to warpage. Looks cheap, but to be fair the price was pretty cheap also. Not particularly happy with this purchase."
2,Good but...,"The game's pretty fun, but the load times are horrible. I can't play it because it takes so long. if you don't mind waiting a minute to a minute and a half for load screens, then this isn't so bad, but I'm too impatient for it."
1,Boring,"Man, this game was boring! Not only it takes like half an hour to load, but the game was so boring! Especially the part where you have to chase Dori? What was that?! All you do is swim around and there is no dnager! it's pointlesss! Fine, you have to find Nemo, but the point of a videogame is to do something exciting on your way to find Nemo, not just swim around hopelessly! I rated this game 1 star, just because I can't rate it 0 star"
1,DO NOT BUY - UNLESS YOU GET IT USED,"My son (7 yrs old) wanted this as soon as it came out - we ran out & bought it & what a disappointment! He played it one time & has never touched it again! Very slow loading times after every sceen almost & just outright boring! If you are looking for a game for a 2 yr old - buy this one, otherwise do not waste your $$"
1,Why Make a Children's Game too Difficult for a Child to Play?,"By the time your child gets to the level where you meet up with Dory, he or she will be handing you the remote so YOU can help finish it. By the time you reach the sea mines, YOU will be so frustrated that you slam the gamepad to the ground. What a ridiculous thing to do to a child - to make a video game about a beloved kid's movie and then make the game so hard to play that they won't ever be able to finish it. I mean, come on! At least have different skill levels available under ""Options""!!!!Do not buy this game. Believe me it will be an exercise in futility and a lesson in containing your frustration and rage."
3,Loading Nemo,"Finding Nemo - for the Gamecube is a decent gamegood graphicsgood music, BUT the music very noticably loops with a full stop in betweenthe game isn't really for the younger kidsmy 8 year old was able to play some of it, but mostly kept handing the controller to her mother and I for assistancecute characters, even our cat likes to watch itbut the absolute worst part of the game?the load time, horrible, horrible, horribleyou can literally go and grab a snack between loadsand you even have to wait for the game to load going back to the main game screenSo to summarize, music could be less ""broken""load time needs to be a TON betterand if it's truly for the younger kids, difficulty is a tad highstill decent game, overall"
3,Okay i guess,I'm almost 13 and loved the movie but the game takes SOOOOO LONG to load!!! I thought our disc was messed up or somthing til i read other reviews! the game is ok considering i love the characters and stuff but i was expecting more because the movie is so great i guess... this game would be especially hard for younger kids even though it looks like it would be a great game for little kids...
1,Horrible,"How can such a great movie be made into such a terrible game? I could give you an idea of the frustration by typing the word ""Loading"" 1000 times here. That's about all you get from this game, anyway."
5,The episodes on this DVD,"The Wizard's Curse - The Z Fighters race to stop Babidi's cronies from delivering the pure energy which will be used resurrect the dreaded Majin Buu. Will they find Babidi's hidden spaceship in time?King of the Demons - In a true moment of horror, Piccolo and Krillin are turned to stone by Dabura. Determined to save their friends lives Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta enter Babidi's ship only to find themselves trapped! With evil warriors in their midst, will they be able to save their friends and find their way out?Vegeta Attacks - Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta discover a trap to drain them of their power. At each stage of Babidi's ship, they must face a fearsome warrior, each more powerful than the last. There's no room for error! Even the tiniest mistake will enable Babidi to steal their energy for Majin Buu!As for my personal opinion, I love all (ok, most ^.^;) things DBZ."
4,Great Finally looks good,This is the begining of a whole new fight to come. If you thought Cell was tough wait till you see whats in store for the Z worriors. The Z fighters in this film find out that a man named Dabora from the other world of demons is helping babidi. Vegeta isn't so worried though and even Goku doesn't think he's to tough. But master Ki isn't so sure of the Super Saiyans power. He wonders could they be so powerful as to take on Dabura by themselves. As Goku enters the 2nd level of Babidi's ship. Master ki wonders how Vegeta Destroyed that last henchman in 10 times gravity ha ha we all know why it was easy so let me just say if you want a good laugh you definetily want this video.
3,"Thought-provoking, but muddled","This was the primary textbook for a graduate conservation biology course I had. I found the book to be an enjoyable read and thought-provoking. However, the book's organization was at time muddled. A decent introduction to the field of conservation biology, but as a textbook, it falls short."
5,A Hit!,"I had the opportunity to read Preceived Notions and hurriedly picked up Twist of Fate as soon as it was available. Ms. Williams has presented another novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters, storyline, twists and turns, and the finale were just AWESOME. The pages came to life as she unfolded this satifying piece of work. She is definitely making a literary statement and I personally am hearing her, LOUD AND CLEAR. I can't wait for the next release."
2,Not for me,The writing seemed directed toward a juvenile audience. Too much like a daytime soap opera and not enough substance. The daily crisis approach instead of a well-developed story overtook a promising start. The main character had so many flaws I couldn't stand her by the end of the book.
5,A Twist od Fate,Once I started I couldn't put it down. I have never bookmarked so many pages for discussion.The characters are so real. Thanks Ashela for the journey and what a journey with pain and joy.This is a must read.My next read will be Preconceived Notion.
5,Really Good Reading!,"A Twist of Fate was very enjoyable. I love the way Robyn developed the characters and yes, it was helpful to know the background of each one. It was especially good to know most of them from childhood. I was a bit disappointed at the exits of some characters, i.e. (Tracey, Parris, the con-producer - I forgot his name). I like the way Ashela & Kyliah's friendship remained; however, I was disappointed about the reasons for them missing out on so many years. They had too much lost time to make up for and friends as close and bonded as they were, would have kept in touch no matter what. (Shame on you Robyn for the way they reunited). Too much anger for me, not the way I would have handled it. But overall, a wonderful read."
5,Why for only GBA?,"Since a long time I was looking for a game exactly like this, and after a lot of research, I found this game....at last. But most unfortunately I don't have a GBA.So what to do now? Would I have to buy a GBA, only for playing this game?...and I don't know whether I will like it or not, as, there are many games which seem to be interesting ""before buying"", but ""after buying"", reveal the fact that, there was nothing so interesting. Anyway, I don't want to buy GBA as I already have PS2. Now, my question is, am I going to have this game for windows or PS2...""ever""? (I chose 5 stars as I don't own this game, I don't want to decrease it's rate because of my review)."
4,interesting read,It was an interesting read. I liked the insights into some of the more notable people in the craft.
2,Mindless is right,"I got this game brand new for $10 where new games usually sell for around $30 to $50, and that should give you a clue. Although it's a very fun game, it can get a bit frustrating both for kids and adults. The controls are not consistent and Pitfall Harry suffers from what I call ""grease on the floor"" syndrome - where the character seems to be slipping on the floor all the time. Also, as was stated previously, the special powers Harry picks up along the way don't always work the first time. The major problem (especially for someone not familiar with Pitfall) is that the character of Harry is not developed sufficiently so that you actually care about him. After a few failed attempts, you tend to throw up your hands and say, ""So what?""Try Psychonauts. Now that's an excellent platformer game."
3,The story of Pompeii has always fascinated me,This is a level 4 book and is readable at this level. The issue I had is the content and illustrations seem a little better suited for older kids. If you have a more mature child the book is well written on a complex event however my 10 and 8 year old both seemed a little young for the pictures in the book.
3,DISAPPOINTING,"My husband and I love Roger Rosenblatt's books and buy as many as we can find but in this one, his humor was sarcastic, biting, down-on-humanity instead of his usual tongue-in-cheek, clever, intelligent writing."
5,Entertaining and Witty,"""Rules for Aging"" is an entertaining and witty compilation of ""words of advice"" for aging successfully. A short and direct book full of humorous anecdotes, this is an entertaining, engaging and worthwhile read.For a lighthearted and intelligent look at life, buy this book."
4,Very Useful Tool,"If you have ever tried electrical trouble-shooting using a straight pin to pierce small wires you can really appreciate this tool. The only drawback that I saw, and so many others have pointed out, is this probe's female receptacle for connecting it to your meter. I thought the price being asked for the companion connector was excessive, and after finding nothing in my test lead collection that fit it, I made my own. I chose a common wire splice that looked about the right size then by stripped off it's plastic insulation. The metal part of the splice fits into the probe tightly and sticks out far enough to connect to my meter's alligator clip. Problem solved!"
4,Must have 4 any diehard wwe fan,I loved this game!!!!!! and if u were lucky enuf 2 get john Cena's nu cd u can copy it 2 yor xbox and update his music!!!!!!! I love create a supestar mode! I created jared b4 subway and slammed his fata## thru a table
3,The ups and the downs,"Here are some of the pros and cons of WWE Raw 2PROSup to 4 players in season modeall new hell in a cellImproved walking animationImproved CAW45+ superstars on updated rosterBackstage areasConsTHQ's failure to let out info on the gameCorrectionsRipping music from your hard drive for CAWs isnt confirmed. Ripping tracks for background music isFighting in crowd hasnt even been made a possibility by THQIt isn't yet XBL compatibleSeason ModeYou have a match on every card. There's a raw and a sd each week and a ppv every month. Between matches you are given several choices. You can interfere in a match, attack sum1, steal something, etc. Example: you steal Kurt's metals. this gains yourself respect from HHH and the Rock. Your friendship with each of them makes them closer for the fact they hate the same guy, Kurt."
1,a horrible game that will amount to nothing,this game is horrible in every sense of the word. so what if it has more matches than raw 1. this trash grows old very quickly. the graphics are ugly. the gameplay is really bad. and the actaul wrestiling is just plain HORRIBLE. the wrestelers move very very slow. i tried so much to deliver a move to my opponent and it didnt work. i just couldent be done. i tried several moves none of them worked. even if you can nail a move which isnt entirely rare. its not fun or exciting to execute these moves because they look so damm sloppy. raw 2 uses an engine that is that slow. none of my desired moves would worked. the gameplay is so messed up. heck even the original smackdown for the original playstation moved faster than this MUCH MUCH FASTER. i could go and on and on but ill just stop right here. maybe some diehard wrestiling fans could enjoy raw 2. but im definitely going back to smackdown here comes the pain.
4,this game is lots of fun,"this game is not exactly what we all wanted,but it's fun.the season mode is better than all other games.u can exactly steal,fight backstage,and set traps.the finishers are not what we wanted but it's good.you can acually f-5 your opponet off the top rope.i hope they would've put the elimination chamber,and the inferno match in this game.hopefully it will be in raw 3."
3,X-Box gets the short end of the wrestling-game stick,"The first couple days that I played this game it was hard to stop, but a week later I found it easy.season mode seems really cool at first but after you go through it once or twice you find that nothing really changes, and while other wrestling games have GM mode RAW 2 doesn'tNo voice overs.There's no talking, and no text to read, there's really no story to speak of. And on top of that there are no announcers, all you here is the same two songs while your in the fightingCAW(create A wrestler)better than Raw 1, but that's not saying muchThe bright side.At least because it's for X-Box you can put your own track's on and make lots of new wrestlers with even better intro'sPS2 gets Smackdown VS RAW, Gamecube gets day of reckoning, and X-Box gets stuck with Raw 2.If your looking to buy this game I'd say wait and see if raw three is any better"
4,Good game with friends.,"There are a few glitches in the game. And some things that are kind of random, but overall I enjoy playing this game with friends. Need to make an updated version of this game."
2,Lots of cool wrestlers.........poor control system.,"Short and sweet: In the end, games are about playability. This game has all the studs, but the poor controls made this nothing more than a button-masher."
4,I love the CAS mode.,"The gameplay in Raw 2 is ehhhhhh, but the CAS is tight. I find it very challenging to try and comeup with a monster intro using my own ripped music, pyro, lights, and the timing of ot all. Hopefully, when Sony gets thier heads outta their bungs, and design the PS3 to include ripped music, Smackdown will be this good!!!!!!!! Other than that, I give this game 3 stars outta 5."
5,this is really cool,this game is really good it has great grapics and a really good season mode you could set some body up or become really good friends with some one i was shawn micheals and i was best friendswith hulk hogan we won the tag team titles then when we lost it i sweat chin music him kicked his a**
4,WWE RAW 2,I THINK THIS GAME SUCK BECAUSE OF THEY SAW MASK IT WAS BLUE. I GOT THE ANOTHER NINTENDO GAMECUBE WWE WRESTLEMANIA XIX IT WAS THE BEST GAME YOU GOT THIS YEAR PERIOD. ATTENTION TO ALL OF THE INTERNET USER DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS SUCK PLEASE GET THE NEW WWE SMACKDOWN: HERE COMES THE PAIN.
5,Not what I expected,"This game is just like the regular sonic, but you have levelsfor each player(Sonic Tails Amy and Knuckles).It is over all a good game, but it is not my favorite.It also has Tiny Chao Garden. You earn rings by playing gamesagainst your Tiny Chao wich you take care of by feeding and teaching him."
4,sonic ruterns!,In every game sonic well... you can use him.He is my favorite caracator of all!But to me it is eazy.But I do not igsactly likethe game.I give the game 4 stars in all!I have already got 2caracters.I bet there is more kids beter then me. But I do mybest every time I play.But my bruther is better then me!His sonic is beter then mine! My cerem is worse then his!All the other things about the game I do not know about.
5,3 year old Niece loves it,I got this as a gift for my 3 year old niece and she loves it. Mom showed her how to use it and she can do it fine all by herself.
3,so many choices,My 5 year old grandson loved the joy sick and the plane - but with all teh options - he easily slides the pointer along the choice options in mid sentence. We are afraid he is going to burn out the motor. Once we cslm him down - and he can respect the toy for what it is suppose to do - I think he will love it. In the begining it is a lot of fun and nois and I don't think he was understanding it's purpose
3,Great Toy but Low Accuracy,"A great and wonderful idea, the globe give your child basic geography understanding but it may be frustrating 'cause its low tolerance can make you give wrong answers."
1,Disappointed,Delivered to the wrong address and not forwarded by the USPS Very disappointed in Amazon and the Post Office as a forwarding order was filed with the appropriate authorities.
5,just plug and play,"it was difficult to find a cable that would work the way I wanted, now I can connect my speakers to my DJ Mixer without a hitch."
1,to whomever wrote about Goodbye horses-,I too am trying to find the soundtrack from married to the mob. I had it at one time on cassette and loved it. I have been looking for it for years. If you find it please post the source here. I'll check back. HH p.s. It's sung by an unknown named Q. Lazzarus(sp?)
2,"""Goodbye Horses"" isn't on here!",I bought this thinking that the song previously mentioned was on it. But it wasn't. I think the rest of the material is ok.
1,"soundtrack: good, sonya: sucky","Sonya C? Gimme a break. The mob has spoken, and they want the movie soundtrack, not some weak gansta pretenda rappa. the people want the judys, psyche and new order. give the people what they want."
2,Pass on this flash,"If you are planning on mounting this flash on your camera, save up and purchase something better. With no manual controls and no automated interaction with the camera itself (e.g. ETTL) this flash has a mind of it's own. It will almost always overblow shots unless you manually adjust your camera's internal settings. This is far from ""automatic"" - spend more and get something that has a better build and actually does its job!"
3,Bower flash,"nice flash, if you want a slave...i am a pro photographer, way too hot for commercial use...doesnt sync with canon cameras..i rate it a 5 out of 10"
2,REDDISH and DARK PHOTOS,"All my photos comes out dark and red when using the S and telephoto mode on the flash itself. Flash has very short illumination range. Very bad skin tones with this flash. Used on a FZ35 lumix camera. The built in flash is much better using a facial tissue as diffuser. Returned the item, this store's customer service has been pretty good so far, they apologized for my disappointment and asked me to return the item to get a refund."
1,BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMEN EVER,this game was simply a vice city in LA there was nothing really special about it at all. i would not even recomend renting this game
5,most under rated game ever,"F*** GTA this game is so better than any other games like these it should win game of the year and ill tell u y.good:music,gameplay graphics,story,epsidoes,bonus upgrades,crime solving,bad:absoluteley nothing!!!!i recomend this game"
4,Good game but not enough,I really loved this game but the only thing is that it is too short. The gameplay is somewhat challenging with an enthrawling storyline. I just wish there was more to it. I would have given this game five stars if it was more difficult and longer. As for the replayability there isn't much there. Once you've beaten the game you don't want to pick it up and play it again. There isn't enough side quests or action in just free balling it. In short this game is everything GTA Vice City hoped to be except that it is way way way too short and needs to be more challenging.
2,NOT AS COOL AS YOU THINK IT IS!!!!,"Well, for a game that ripped off a bunch of cool games (Getaway extensivly, which ripped off GTA, Max Payne, etc.), it was mediocre at best. The graphics are better in some situations, but worse in others, not too consistent. I beat the game in less than 7 hours (all 3 endings + upgrades, and alternate episodes). After you get the hang of the game, it becomes increasingly easier and easier. Which is weird, since games usually get progressivly more difficult. Plus, it goes from a realistic storyline to fantasy storyline.The best way I can summarize this game is: It's a game that you would like to play until you beat it and never play it again. Hardly any replay factor, unlike the GTA series (for me anyway). If you want my advice, go to Blockbuster, rent it, solve it, return it. You just saved over 40 bucks."
3,Definitely NOT A Competitor to Michelin!,"This book does provide a long and detailed list of many restaurants, from very large and elegant to small, family run establishments. However, since the book is from 1992, I found it to be a bit too outdated to be very helpful to me. The information provided was very helpful and comprehensive, but just outdated. Local tourist offices can provide much more up-to- date information as do many hotels. And of course we will always have the Michelin Guide!"
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!,"...After 30 minutes of watching the movie, my husband and I both decided this film wasn't worth our time, but we decided to finish it anyway, just to see if there is anything in this film that might change our thinking regarding this sorry excuse of a monster movie. THIS MOVIE REALLY [STINKS]. The acting is so bad, the effects are cheap-looking, the plot itself is boring. This movie is a waste of time and money!!! Also, Godzilla is way better than this movie! One of the reviewers is right, this is not even worth a rental!"
3,A balanced review,"This video game is rather repetitive. Most levels involve merely swimming through rings over and over. However, given this simple game play a younger child will probably find it too difficult or frustrating to play it for long.You are given plenty of chances to practice a level in the face of failure, so with some patience each level can be finished. It's too bad that the control in this game is a bit off, which is what makes completing the simple repetitive levels harder.Nemo fans will enjoy the clips from the movie that are integrated into the game. The in-game engine bits however are a bit off and disappointing since they are animated at a lesser level than the Pixar clips."
3,Glittery,"I got this stuff to put under the tree to remind me of when I was a kid. But I took the batting out of the plastic and glitter got EVERYWHERE. It was kind of annoying to attempt to vacuum all of it up. Not saying don't get this item just wish that the glitter had been affixed somehow to the batting, and not just thrown onto the drape."
1,Don't waste your money,"Shiny pictures and Nothing original, seen similar work everywhere,it is like walking around Venice Italy and taking bad pictures.It would have been a real book if each ""work"" would have been explained in an historical contest,the way it is presented is nothing more than a family photo album.Definitely not good for any students,better take a trip to Italy and avoid the middle man.In summary this assembly of pictures is a bad composition of architectural elements poorly copied from the old world."
3,eh..,bought book knowing it was used but it was pretty beat up. didn't expect something that looked like came out of a garbage can.
5,You Won't Find Anything Better Out There,"As a beginner in tarot, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pick something up and ""do it."" I've read a handful of tarot guides and I found the tone of Ms. Fowler's book to be refreshingly personal, eloquent, and insightful. One feels personally guided through the process, almost as though the author has her arm around you. Her beautifully creative descriptions of the symbols allow the user/practitioner to access the depths within them. At the same time, her description/use of seven levels for each card highlights the importance of striving to articulate one's question in order to arrive at the most specific possible outcome (this may sound complicated, but it's not--and the levels are so well described that the result is a greater level of guidance.) Finally, the guide does not rely on a specific deck of cards--all you need is a regular ""playing"" deck and you're off!I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone and everyone--it'll change your life."
2,"great depth, if you are a martian or two yr old...","To sum it up, I found this book to be base. I think the IDEA of it was great, but the examples of situations and remedies for them were SO OVERLY SIMPLISTIC! If you have no idea what anorexia or bulimia are, if you haven't a clue about the experiences of family and friends of people close to them suffering from the eating disorder, then by all means - get this book. Otherwise, you might find yourself wasting your time and money."
5,a fine example of equipment,This one xlr male to two xlr female used to tie stereo out put together in a mono mode. high quality item well made and perfectly fits my need
3,REALLY hard to clean,"This table looked so promising, I thought it would be a great way for my child to play with play doh. However, the holes that are supposed to hold the markers do not in fact, hold them. The holes that are supposed to hold the cans of play doh do not fit the cans. The worst part about this table is that it is sooo hard to clean. I actually leave it out on the patio for the rain to get at, because I cannot seem to get into the little crevices. Basically, since the table can't hold the play doh or activity markers, you have to store them somewhere else, and what you are left with is a big, bulky table just taking up space. In my opinion, parents should save their money."
2,Is that price right??,"I got this for my daughter last year for $30 and for that price it's fine - not great. I would not spend more than $30 for it at all. The extruder handle breaks off everytime she uses it and it is difficult to clean up the dried bits. The play-doh storage cups don't hold the containers, so everytime she bumped the table they fell out. However, the legs and table top are sturdy."
2,Do not buy unless you like to clean!,Too difficult to clean - spent most of Christmas morning cleaning up the thing because of all the nooks and crannys where the play doh hides. Kids already want Santa to take it back because they're tired of mom nagging about cleaning up the mess and because they're master pieces have specks of various other playdoh colors.
5,Diablo - Hero of the Night,This is another book from the series. It was a great book and continued the book Diablo My dream Horse. In this book Ricki goes on a night ride with some friends. It ends up in a jumble when Sharazan bolts off with Kevin on his back. Ricki decides to sneak off from the group and tries to find Kevin. They both end up getting injured but everything turns out ok. This is a really great book and I reccomend other girls should read it too - if they're horse lovers like me!
4,Smooth jazz.,"As the 1 star reviewer states, this CD has too much electronic orchestration! This CD is OK."
4,Disney should have spent a little more time on this one!,"What a disappointment. This game starts out so fun and lighthearted, with beautiful graphics and fun games. Then within a matter of a few levels it goes from fun to nearly impossible. My 6 year old, who is a master at games like the Hobbit, Blackstone and Star Wars, gave up on it. It was frustrating for all of us, who never had the patience to get past the ""pipeline"". Thankfully, we had rented it - which we took back and were able to get them to exchange it out. Don't waste your money on this one. The games on the Finding Nemo DVD are much more fun than this!"
4,Nemo's Lost Again:,A nice game. Better than Shark Tales. Cute movie scenes between challenges. My 4yr old grandson enjoys it. Good family fare :-)
4,A Caldecott winner about the upcoming winter.,"In this children's book, which won the 1949 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a children's book, animals prepare for the upcoming winter, each in its own way."
4,"Palm IIIc Review, a Technology Consultant's prespective.","This is my second palm, having shattered the screen on my original Palm V and so far i have been extremely happy with this new model. The memory difference between this unit's 8MB and the V's 2MB is extreme!! I am finally able to sync with full-scale corporate databases without a memory issue, as well as the development of custom desktop application-channeled Palm applications without the memory constraints of the V. It clearly dosn't have the lavish sleek look as the V series does, but i'd gladly trade that up for the color screen which is quite sleek in it's own right. Only con i've seen so far is lack of wireless modem's that are compatible with the IIIc unit, nevertheless this is a definite improvement over earlier models!!"
4,Less than satisfactory display,"Lets face it, the main reason to purchase this model over the other offerings from Palm or Visor is the colour display. Unfortunately, having used both the IIIc and the Vx, I'm underimpressed with the quality of the image on the IIIc. It is colour, which is a pretty neat change to Palm's previous greyscale models, but I find it much more difficult to focus on the screen image. It seems to flicker quite a bit, and gave me a headache after using it for an hour or so. I found the screen on the Vx to be much more comfortable, especially if used for a long period of time. The Palm operating system is wonderful, much easier to use, and more efficient, I feel, than Windows CE, but I'd go with one of the b&w models for the time being. Also, the IIIc is much thicker and less stylish than the brushed aluminum case of the V series, which may be something you want to consider before purchasing this model."
3,"Seems solid, but don't use it with Rock Band microphone!","Bought this for use with the PS3 Rock Band microphone, and the mic is really too fat for this holder. I should have done a little more research, so please learn from my mistake. Nothing wrong with the holder, though, it seems solidly built."
3,Women's 10 marked as Men's 10,"I ordered both a sand and a black men's size 10. The sand was properly sized, the black was tiny--the sole was 3/4"" shorter than that of the sand. Return of a defective product netted another tiny black 10. It's pretty clear that they have a warehouse full of improperly labelled black size 10's, and that nobody at Amazon reviews the customer comments about an order."
5,super shipping,"these boots run a little small, so i ordered the next larger size. the price and the quality where great, and the shipping was omg.... i know it was only @ 4 days, and i ordered them during christmas :) ."
5,Suede Leather Wellingtons - Sand,"Good boot for the price. Not the quality of the higher dollar boots. After a couple weeks of wear, the glue is starting to pull away where the sole meets the upper."
2,Sheepskin boot,"For the price, these were a good value. The problem I found was that one boot is small than the other or at least feels that way. Never had this problem with this type of boot or mocossins before so think that the production process or material is different enough that this size difference can appear. I am wearing them trying to get the shorter one to fit better"
5,A must have movie,I have known this story only in German and was ecstatic when I saw it also in English. This is a heartwarming story for young and old. enjoy
4,Very nice gift and nice case.,This is a cool looking BBQ set. a very nice gift for a someone starting to grill ( This IS NOT intended for the thermos grill ). this would damage non-stick grills.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the quality of the tools and case. Handles on the tools are easily pulled off. The tools themselves, however, do feel sturdy. The metal case is cheap feeling. The tools are held in the case with Velcro and most of the Velcro fasteners were separated from the case"
5,Simply Amazing,"I stopped using my Palm about a year ago... yet another gadget fallen from the limelight. I didn't think I was going to use it again until one day at an office meeting someone pulled out and unfolded this keyboard, plugged it into their Palm, and proceeded to take notes during the entire meeting.Yes, I may be a gadget geek, but I *simply* had to have one! Now, I bring my Palm and keyboard into customer meetings while everyone else is fumbling with their laptops. Everyone stares and is amazed at how cool it looks as I unfold the keyboard - and I can type out notes just as quickly as they can (it is a *regular* size keyboard!). At the end of the meeting, I fold it up quickly and am ready to go. I later hotsync the Palm with my PC and vioala! My notes are now on my PC where they're actually needed! My Palm is cool and useful again!"
3,Decent Ferret Figurine,"I purchased this toy for my growing collection of animal figurines. I also have a fondness for ferrets and there's not too many ferret-themed toys on the market. It's realistic in detail and perfect for a diorama or hiding among my keys and coin jar on my nightstand. One very slight difference I did notice is that the tail on my ferret was different from the pictured product. Instead of a curled tail, the figurine I received had its tail sticking straight out behind the ferret."
5,Process control change,"Based on this book, we are changing all our process control. It has gained our CEO's trust."
4,Missing Tapes,"There weren't any tapes in the package, only the lesson book. I'd like to get the tapes because that's why I bought it. I gave 4 stars anyway because I'm sure this was a mistake."
4,Beginner's Guide,"Most of the information in this work will be ""old hat"" to Catholics with more than a passing theological understanding of the faith. Yet, this little book is very informative and receives high marks for readability. In fact, it is an excellent beginner's guide to the subject of exorcism. Since the author has a ""gift"" for taking a complex subject and rendering it into simple terms, his question and answer technique seems especially well-suited to the subject matter. Even without the drama and excitement of Fr. Malachi Martin's HOSTAGE TO THE DEVIL, this book is anything but a snooze. For someone who is just now becoming interested in the subject of exorcism, I would recommend starting here."
5,Great FAQ Type Referrence Book,"Terrific book for someone who wants to know what Exorcism is all about. I would suggest it as the first book read on the topic, as it's written in a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" type format. There's no doubt that Exorcism is something to be taken quite seriously."
4,Great toy!,"Everywhere I look, I see a Palm. I finally decided to see what the big deal was. I was not impressed with my Win CE machine (I like MS, just not in a handheld) so it took a while before I'd try this. I'm an immediate convert! I never knew there was so much you could do with a Palm and I'm VERY glad the IIIxe comes with 8 megs. I almost bought a IIIe, just because I'm a cheapskate- glad I didn't! I used 4 megs in the first week. Books, games, addresses, star charts, you name it, it's out there!Only gets 4 stars because I dropped it less than 2 feet and cracked the screen. Take my advice- get a STRONG case for it and/or buy the screen replacement warrenty from Palm. $100 to replace the screen, $30 (or so) for the warrenty."
4,excellent product,"This is a well thought out product, and a great ""peripheral brain"". There is an incredible amount of software available for this product-many of it free on the Net. I work at a hospital and use it to store phone #, but it also has an entire PDR, and other medical data on it I was able to download off the Net at pharmaceutical and medical sites. I also looked at the new Pocket PC, which I found to be very good, but for right now this is a cheaper PDA and does the job."
5,Hooked on the IIIxe,"I would definitely go with the IIIxe, not the Compaq. You are getting the palm quality and name, great resoures, technical support, etc. I have only had mine a month - and this is my first one - and I have not been disappointed."
1,Beware of this product,"When changing the batteries in your Palm IIIxe if you leave the batteries out for more than 1 minute, it completely wipes out all the data on your handheld. This bit of crucial information is not listed in the literature that comes with the product."
1,I HATE my Palm IIIxe,"In short, it does not work (the batteries die at least once a week, erasing all information, and it will not hotsync effectively with either of my PCs, so it is essentially useless) and Palm support is difficult to get to and not very helpful. I would recommend AGAINST buying this product!!"
4,Solid but...,"Graffitti's ease is definitely over-rated. Graffiti is not that easy to use. I am definitely thinking of getting the keyboard to type in the huge amount of data (addresses and such) I need to reference. Also a downside not really mobile like the Palm V. This was my first outing with Palm after being paper and pen for years, and I would say that the Palm is really worthwile if you travel, if you have a lot of contacts, and if you are going to use it."
2,Never again....,"After seing what a Pocket PC or Windows CE hand held can do, I'll never buy another palm."
5,I life-saver,I purchased this PDA earlier this year and have used it ever since. It's become a habit to carry it around. I use it for practicly everything. I am 17 and currently a Senior in High School with 3 out of 4 semesters completed for my CCNA certification. I carry all my important notes and memos on it. I don't think I could live without it again.
3,"Cheep, but expensive to maintain","This Palm IIIxe is great and affordable for most PDA abilities, however I don't recommend it for the serious PDA user. The reason in one word: batteries. Depending on how often you use this, you'll be changing out batteries every 2-4 weeks. At ($)... bucks a pop for fresh juice, it adds up very quickly. My advice is to save your money and get one of the rechargeable models."
3,"good, but short crystal life","Love the organizer itself. Great for those who just want to organize their schedule and phone list. Problem: crystal in display goes out withing two years. It costs $100- for a refurbished replacement from Palm. Really a good product, but you have to plan on replacement costs every couple years, as well as remembering to back up often."
4,"I miss my Palm Personal; IIIxe not as solid, screen lacks!","I owned [or perhaps it owned me] a Palm Personal for four years. It died earlier this month (RIP). Even with only 1/2 Meg of ram, I never outgrew it.I am impressed with the storage capability of my new IIIxe. The infrared is cool, since my family and coworkers also have Palms. Although the IIIxe is an upgrade in specifications, however, I liked the Personal edition better; the Personal felt more durable and the screen didn't squish under the stylus.I have heard a lot of reviews telling me that the new IIIxe screen is so much clearer and higher contrast than the older models. I think the new screen is much more difficult to read than my Personal model. I'm not so sure that I am satisfied with this new unit, but I've become so reliant on the Palm that I'll have to keep it. I can't justify the money for the color upgrade."
5,Do I need more?,"With less than $300 you can have an outstanding, state-of-the-art assistant that replaces you planner, your check balance and almost your laptop. You can download everything from a game to a map application and for free! With a Palm IIIxe (with 4 times the memory of the V), a GPS, a palm modem and a cellular phone you are all set with flexibility for the new millenium, you can do whatever you like!"
2,Good while it lasted...,It was great for a while but then after about 4-5 months kept having display problems then no power then display again. Spent what seemed like hours on hold with support and got no where. My wife threw out receipt so now I am out of luck. Going to iPaq next. The only other complaint is that it is hard on batteries (2 weeks max and don't let them run out or you start over)
2,update on unfortunate circumstance,Got my Palm IIIxe back and discovered that they hadn't bothered to repair it. They just put in a new set of batteries. Had to go through the same routine of calling them on my dime and 20 minutes later I'm right back where I started. The unit has to be shipped back to Palm for repair and I'm out of a PDA for the next couple of weeks. These guys are the worst.
2,Deceptive sale,"Item came with serial number removed from the back. No software. No manual. Batteries included were not alkaline.No registration card. Therefore no garauntee from Palm!Is this a ""new"" product? I doubt it."
5,"Great CD-ROM, a must have!","Incredible CD-ROM with everything you could posibly want to know about the ""Hot Ones"", 1955 to 1957. Hundreds of high-res photos. It even has TV commercials and sound effects. The screen saver is worth the price alone! I also have other titles from this author which I also love!"
5,The Kicks kick!,"I don't know what some of the other reviewers are hearing- yes, the Kicks play derivative power-pop, but each song is great in it's own right, and the CD is probably one of the best this year. ""Radar"" is a great opener to the record, with it's frantic chorus and energetic beat, and there are also mellower songs like ""12 Steps"" and ""Bomb"". So, whatever mood you're in, The Kicks play perfectly crafted tunes that will stick with you for a long time."
3,Do your HOMEWORK!,"Granted this album is fun to listen to. The problem, is that it almost the exact same record they release four years ago under the name Ashtray Babyhead. Plus i'm almost certain that they didn't even re-record the songs. LAME! Don't get me wrong, it's got a couple new songs that are awesome. But I think that if the last band you were in didn't make it, try again with something new. Don't just change your name! If you like this record you'll love Ridel High, AM Radio and of course Ashtray Babyhead."
4,"Good hats, but beware of size...","Good quality & they look sharp. But beware of the ""one size fits all"" or ""youth size"". it fits my three year old boy perfectly. but my six year old daughter can't fit it on her head. My kids are big for their age, though. Recommend for ages five & under."
4,Not too bad at all.,"I purchased a new Mac a short time ago and wanted to protect it. I am inside and outside all day at work in some different conditions and was ruining my keyboard. I purchased this on a whim as I have had good luck with stuff purchased on here...it works great. It protects my keyboard and keeps it clean. It didn't form as well as I would have liked it to but the up edged top corners are not a big deal. While typing you don't even notice that it's on there, which was a concern of mine. It is light weight and can be kept on even if you close your computer. Great product and am completely glad I picked it up."
5,iSkin Protouch Keyboard Protector works like a charm!,"The iSkin Protouch Keyboard Protector is excellent! It does it's job, and fits almost perfectly.My only suggestion is that the underside of the protector that sits directly onto the keys would be slightly tacky to hold a little firmer to keep from the occasional slip, or from the edges that slightly curl up. Otherwise it is great at the job it was made to do, and that is keeping dust and hair, etc... from getting down inside of the casing."
4,Macbook runs hot.,"I use it when there is a danger from spills, and it does the job. The only concern I have is that the macbook pulls air from around the keys on your keyboard to blow out the vent in the back to keep the processor cool. When I cover the keyboard, the macbook runs about 10 degrees Celsius hotter than without it. Take it off and it cools back down. The guy at the mac store said that it wouldn't hurt anything, but I'm not so sure. If you put a fan against a wall and it has no air to pull into itself it will burn up, and the way I see it, that is sort of what you are doing here.Conclusion: It works, I just wouldn't keep it on the keyboard all of the time."
5,TOTALLY NERDY,"But thats the price you gotta pay for protection. It's like a condom for your supermodel computor, but hey, it costs $1400. Protect it."
2,Disappointing !,I was very excited to give this to my 8 year old Pokemon addict. The toy is very cheap - comes in attached plastic and needs to be assembled. When assembled the wing breaks off constantly and the tail doesn't stay together. JUNK!
3,The Pokeman Experience,"We found it a little frustrating to put together and it doesn't seem to stay together extremely well. It is a nice figure, once it is put together."
3,wiper blades,"a bit pricy, but best deal i found,never used teflon blades befor on my truck it drags a small amount of water on the back stroken, never happened b4 with regular trico winter blades, will go back regulat winter blades"
1,Useless. Does not conform to curvature of windshield.,"I ordered an 18"" and 19"" blade for my 2006 MINI Cooper S, because I live in an area with harsh winter weather, and I wanted to try a winter blade. Unfortunately, these wiper blades are useless. They do not conform to the curvature of the windshield. Only the central 2/3 or so of the blade makes contact with the windshield. The outside edge of the passenger blade probably sits half an inch or more off the glass.I switched back to myPIAA 95048 Super Silicone Black Wiper Blade - 19""blade, which works well despite not being designed specifically for winter use."
5,I Purchased The Quality Audit Handbook,Book came in excellent condition. Could not tell it was used. Arrived promptly.I will definitely use this seller again.
2,What's is with the background?,"Sorry, but I can't get into this. The music is alright but nearly every song has voices in the background. I guess this was supposed to be considered part of it . If I knew I wouldn't have bought this. These are presumably lines used in the shows, I just don't see how it goes with the music."
5,THE TRUTH IS IN THIS ALBUM.,"VERY GOOD SCORE BY MARK SNOW AFTER THE THIRD SEASON OF ""THE X FILES"". THE SCORE INCLUDES DIALOGUES AND MONOLOGUES FROM THE FIRST TWO (IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN) SEASONS - INCLUDING DUANNE BARRY. BY THE DIALOGUES AND MONOLOGUES IT'S BETTER THAN THE SCORE FROM THE MOVIE (1998). SCARY WHEN LISTENED WITH CLOSED EYES IN THE NIGHT. WORTH THE PRICE."
2,Why?,"I was an avid fan of the earlier seasons of the X-Files and bought this CD because I love the music. Almost every track on this CD has dialogue from the show dubbed over it. What gives? A soundtrack is suppose to let you enjoy the music out of context. If I want to hear the music with dialogue added, I can just watch the show. I give this 2 stars because even though the music is excellent, I don't like being forced to hear Mulder and Scully talk over it."
1,Too Much Talking!!!!!,"This CD looked so cool when I first saw it. On the cover I read ""Words by Chris Carter,"" so I figured that there was a couple of tracks of dialogue taken from the show. WRONG!!! Every track is blanketed with annoying sound bites from the show (i.e. ""Is he human...?"", ""I don't know...""). If I wanted to hear all that I just should've held a tape recorder up to my TV, I would have gotten the same results. Mark Snow's music can stand alone and do well. But with the inserted dialogue, the music becomes clouded and muffled. It's like saying ""Hey, this is X-Files music!"" I give Mark Snows music five stars and if I could give the dialogue a -10 I would (at least on the CD). The dialogue should have talked its way off the CD."
3,Great music,"All in all pretty good. Eric Johnson was better on Austin City Limits by him self. I also bought G3- in Denver, liked it better."
3,rather short,"This is a good DVD but not realy a concert. It's organized as a ""best of concert"" kind of show. There songs from each of them. In the end the get together but by them the DVD is almost in the end. I confess that I'm disappointed and that I expected more. Satriani seems to have a new one coming out ""Live in San Francisco"". Looking forward to this one."
5,Stop and Think,"As I listened to Ms. Benyus speak passionately about Mother Nature's innovations at a meeting of energy executives, I said to myself, ""You've got to read her book."" I did. The book, in its clear readable style, was enjoyable and gave me a quick understanding of biomimicry - electicity generation modeled after green plants, pollution free chemical factories. Although Ms. Benyus' point of view is sometimes a bit radical for someone in a conservative, old line business, the book challenged me to stop and think about how we can innovate while being mindful of Mother Nature."
2,More of a rave about unsustainability than about biomimicry,"The purported subject of this book is facinating, however most of the book seems to be about something else. The author lectures about current poor ecological practices (which were ""news"" about ten years ago). I found very little in this book regarding actual progress in technologies that were inspired by biological systems. Rather disappointing."
2,"Misleading title- propaganda heavy, content light","Halfway finished, I am putting this book down. It's very rare that I don't finish a book. If you have a strong science background, you will be very disappointed in what this book has to offer. The alleged topic is fascinating, and I think I will go find a book that really discusses it.The photosynthesis chapter screams for pictures and diagrams, but the author has provided none. The reader will read thousands clumsy words trying to describe complex geometries, waiting for a clarifying picture that never comes."
5,Must have!,"This book is too too cute! My nephews had it and I had to grab it for a first birthday gift. Fun pictures and silly concept.""worms are yucky, spaghetti is yummy!""""Hot sauce is yucky, chocolate sauce is yummy!"""
5,Another one for my collection,"I love all the books by Leslie Patricelly. The very first one I picked up from TJMaxx and even though it was soooo simple, I couldn't resist it just because it was so simple. It was ""yes yes, no, no"" book. The illustrations were so funny that I was giggling myself all the way to check out. Now I am adding up some more books written by her. They are all very simple but so very adorable and have very simple illustrations that are very easy for a toddler to understand. I would recommend them all to any new mom."
2,Should have veggies as a YUMMY,"I really like the idea of this book, but with all the obesity in kids and in America today, ice cream and cupcakes should not be on the 'yummy' pages of this book. Not that they aren't yummy, but peas, spinach or fresh fruit should be listed as yummy. I was just disappointed that with so many weight issues, and I'm trying to raise my baby to love his veggies (which he does), it's a bummer books like this don't exemplify healthy nutritious eating."
5,"Oh, gosh... Just so funny and cute!","Leslie Patricelli really knows how to read little kids' reactions to words and concepts. Her illustrations are simple but hilarious.Everything about this book makes it a winner, and adults or older kids will LOVE sharing it with tots.Definitely buy this one if there's a new baby in your circle!"
1,Not for kids of parents that drink coffee or eat spicy food,"This book is definitely not for kids of parents that drink coffee or eat spicy food. We gave it away. We enjoy spending weekend mornings playing with our son while we drink our coffee and he eats his breakfast. I do not want him getting a wrong idea that, together with our coffee, we sneak in a random worm or a mud cake while he is not looking. The same goes for the spicy sauce picture, as he sees us eating spicy foods and also samples some. This book would simply confuse him. A good idea but some very wrong choices for specific examples."
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap Product","I bought this software expecting alot more than it delivered, on the box it says that it has more features than other more expensive Spanish software. Don't be fooled, this is basically rote learning. I learned a lot of words in Spanish but not how to speak the language or learn grammar etc. The price is low, but it was a waste of money. You are better off spending more on Learn To Speak Spanish like I did and actually learn the language."
5,BBB,Bad Boy Bill never disappoints me. The live edition is just tops. he goes to the next song and you barely notice.
5,top house DJ,"I used to check this guy out, back when I was in Chicago in the mid/late 90s. He's been in the game for a while and it shows. DVD is great and brings back some great memories. Audio selection is a good mix of new (at the time) stuff and more classic sounds/samples. Not his best, but still a solid 5-star record. Fans of BBB or Chicago-style house will enjoy this."
1,Poor Communication,ordered book on 08-12-2011 waited until 08-19-2011 to advise me that book was not in stock. School starts very soon. Thanks for nothing.
1,Seller didn't ship item!,I will be filing a claim in 2 days as the seller didn't bother to ship the book. My student has been in school for almost a month now and has to keep copying the math teacher's book as we still haven't received the book we ordered 3 weeks ago.
1,Dissatisfied customer.,"My problem with this book is that after taking the diagnostic test it contains, I soon learned that it DOES NOT include a score conversion chart like the real LSAT contains. Without the score conversion chart it could more difficult for the test taker to gauge his/her improvement. Also buyer beware: it DOES NOT contain actual practice and test questions from previosly administered LSAT exams as do both the Princeton Review and Kaplan LSAT prep books. As a consumer this was not obvious to me. I was dissapointed in this product."
2,"Creating ""world-mindedness""","That is one teacher's description of what the book helps her to do. It is certainly good to learn about other cultures and develop empathy and compassion towards all. Nonetheless, it is the height of moral relativism to assume (teach) that all cultures are equally good. Look with an open mind towards the cultures of Somalia or Palestine, then look to the flag of the USA with renewed patriotism in your heart."
3,Kings of the Sun,Starts out very slow..but it ends well. I did not realize that Yul Brynner made movies like this... nice to fine them.
5,Powerful lessons! This film should be shown in classrooms everywhere!,"Not only is this a great piece of entertainment, but it also has some profound lessons to teach especially in our current state of world affairs. If only every world political leader, religious leader and even community leaders could heed the lessons from this film. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of laying aside hatred and replacing it with tolerance. We can belong to different tribes and cultures and yet view those differences as opportunities to learn from each other without having to resort to racism, bigotry and war. The film also teaches us that religion can be good, but we shouldn't fear putting aside old beliefs that no longer serve us and which only cause harm and injury to others in the name of God. This film would be a powerful teaching aid and springboard for some great classroom discussions on all of these topics."
3,Is hokum the right word for it?,"This is silly film, a real curiosity. If you do not care reality at all, then it is fun to watch. There is a lot of posturing where Brynner is at best. He looks charismatic even in this kind of pictures. Often the main characters speak like modern people. There are a lot of sermons about gods and how one should live. Everybody speaks good English and they understand easily each others. One has to wait perhaps too long for the final battle which is O.K. and there is not much blood, which is good for my taste. Only rarely I have seen so many real people as in this film. This is he major asset of this film. I do not know if Brynner is a great actor but he has always a wonderful presence. George Chakiris is a bit weak hero for my taste. Hang your brains and enjoy this hokum!"
1,I was forced to give it a star!,"I read the reviews of the other viewers, ""What movie did they watch""? ""Kings of the Sun"" was so bad I almost turned it off! It was typical of the times it was produced, but I see now why I've never heard of it because they probably never released it. The acting was terrible, the outfits were plastic and from outer space. It had no historic value at all, the actors must have been laughing between takes. Yul Brynner was a genius as ever, great actor as usual and the only part of the movie that held it together. I'll put it in my bad movie section."
3,smaller than anticipated,"Because it is Langenscheidt it is a good dictionary, however, it is palm sized, not book sized."
2,"It works for a couple months, then the left side goes...","I bought this product 2 times, it always lasts a couple months and then slowly but consistently the left channel starts cutting out until its completely inaccessible.I would buy the grado model (I have 325is's so they would match) but the 1/8"" jack side is too thick to use with my cellphone case."
5,It works,"This adapted the hell out of my 1/4"" cable. It's a super adapter. Got an 1/8"" hole and a 1/4"" plug? BLAMMO! Adapted."
3,Good book-- but BE CAREFUL!,"I lost half of my Koi in the space of 6 hours, because I was counting on this book, and it does not even mention the catastrophic disaster known as PH Crash. Unless you find out about that, and take preventative measures, this WILL happen to you!!This book fails to describe water chemistry in sufficient detail, and these days it's pretty outdated. However, it does have a fantastic photo catalogue of koi varieties, and a decent overview of health problems, pond construction, and seasonal care. If you have fish, make sure to get multiple books in case one is missing important information."
3,Cute toy,"I love how the balls roll and spin on this toy. It is also fun for my daughter to try putting other toys on it and watching them spin around. The balls are also fun on their own. The downfall of this toy (and why, I think, my daughter doesn't play with it much) is that when she tries to pull it, the front end lifts up and the balls fall off."
2,No release valve,"Poorly designed product. The sprayer doesn't have a release valve so get ready to be sprayed when you open the tank under pressure. The pump is fragil, will not take any abuse.Solo Stainless Steel Handheld Sprayer - 2 Gallon Capacity, Model# 465"
3,Good Sound,"This player has the worst instruction manual ever printed in the English language. If you don't already know how an MP3 player is supposed to work, you are in trouble. It also has a screen so small that it is almost useless. Some advertised features of the product I cannot find in the menus. And yet, I like it... for the price it is a great toy. You will be buying different earbuds for sure."
4,Maximum R&B Explosion,"Caught on to Hank Ballard's magic by the hopped up tune of ""Work With Me Annie"". The other songs aren't nothing to sneeze at, this is a potent mix of Hank Ballard & The Midnighters' best tracks. HB&M ranks up there with Gene Vincent, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry as the tops in early American protorock. Their contribution was in the combination of those spicy lyrics with the energetic studio work. Recommended for those maximum R&B days."
1,Do not recomend,I wanted to know more about Germany and it's people. I found this book boring and uninteresting. It jumped back and forth and was hard to follow. I finally put the book down half way through.
1,Give me 0 stars for this one,"How horrible!!! All I can do is go to Italy for a week and say words like yellow corn and ask where the bank is ""Dove' la banca?"" If I was asked a question or wanted to converse about flowers I couldn't because well the disks don't even teach you how to say flower. No sentence building, no basics even to learn when to use il, lo or la. Don't even ask about the other disks because it just gets worse. Only two teach the very simple words and they speak so fast you don't learn correct pronounciation. Save your money and go buy an Italian text book and do the homework. I realy wished I would have researched before buying this product."
5,Outstanding performances - a must have for every person of Welsh Decendance,"I remember first listening to Thomas L Thomas sing the Welsh folktune favorite ""All through the night"" at my grandmother Jones' house in the late 1950's. Mr. Thomas' clear, commanding voice left an unforgettable impression on my, and caused me to ""seek out"" works of this great Opera Singer 50 years later. I was delighted to find this video tape, which I've purchased and listened to time and time again. I'va also shared it with my Father - Dr. G. William Jones, who well remembers the importance of music to the Welsh. A ""must buy"" for all of Welsh Decendance, and all who appreciate fine Opera presented in a contemporary setting."
2,Very disappointed,"I don't usually run out and immediately purchase a recently released book, but made an exception for this book based on reviews I read on Amazon. I was so totally disappointed with not only the story but the author's excruciatingly derivative narrative. Her obsession with Bronte, Collins and Austen only made me realize that she is merely a ""wannabe"" who has little of the talent or imagination of those literary giants."
4,Wonderfully Engrossing,"Diane Setterfield's best selling novel, ""The Thirteenth Tale"", is unashamedly derivative of almost every gothic novel ever written except in one key element; there is no mysterious, brooding, handsome master of the manor. And oh, how refreshing it was to skip that nonsense...almost. I was a tad disappointed at the whiff of romance in the end - but the rest of the story was so engrossing I forgave it. Probably Ms. Setterfield's publishers made her add it since it's patently impossible for literature or movies to depict a single woman as happily alone!"
4,Excellent Read,This isn't normally the kind of subject I would choose to read. I couldn't find anything else to read on my really long plane ride. I am so glad I grabbed it. It was so well written and captivating that I couldn't put it down all the way from Finland back to the US! GREAT BOOK!
4,Loved It,I've read such mixed reviews about this book that I think it's a love it or hate it kind of story. I loved it.I loved the characters and the unfolding of the story within the story. I found it captivating and impossible to resist.
3,A novel for readers,"I can see why this book got such good reviews: it was written by a reader, for readers. It is about reading and writing as much as it is about sisters, secrets, and ghosts. It is very compelling to read, but I could understand how it could be dull if read over an extended period of time. Overall, it was a good book. But it wasn't a great book."
3,"Fast Read, Enjoyable, but Not Significant","It is an easy read and very romantic. The biggest down fall is that the plots are very predictable... there are a few intriguing and innovating ideas, but I don't believe it is as profoundly written as it is advertised. Overall, it is an entertaining story."
5,Lives up to the hype,"I'm not a hype reader, so I didn't pick up this book until May of 2008, long after it had been hyped and written about all over the web. However I was drawn in by the subject matter (a booklover and writer who is asked to write the biography of a very well known and successful, yet mysteriously private, author).The style is gothic--similar to a Bronte novel, and so it reads as old-fashioned. There is something of a ghost story, and there is a definitely a suspenseful unraveling of the facts.I highly recommend it. It lives up to the hype."
3,PALE SHADES OF JANE EYRE..,"""Life is compost...the writers life needs time to rot away before it can be used to nourish a work of fiction"", so says Diane Setterfield via her alter-ego Vida Winters.The Miss Winters of the tale is renouned for her story telling prowess, a genuine talent that is shared by Ms. Setterfield as she takes us into the labyrinth that is The Thirteenth Tale.The story pulls us along into it's depths and because we want to know ""the answer"" we keep reading. As it turns out, the writers prose has captivated us...and for that she gets five stars. The story itself and the explanation of ""the mystery"" is only a two and a half....perhaps it needed a little more compost. Overall rating...3 1/2."
1,Perfectly dreadful book NO STARS DESERVED !!!,"If you loved Jane Eyre and Rebecca, avoid this book. It's hackneyed, poorly written, boring, full of overused cliches. Going by the rave reviews, I bought a hardback copy when it first came out and was really disappointed. Of course, I didn't care for Deep End of the Ocean or Lovely Bones so that may give you an idea of my tastes.However, if you like Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel, this is right up your alley."
3,stay focused on book!,"A good read, It jumps back and forth quite a bit but this book can keep you wondering,I love the way the author leaves you hanging from time to time ,The Thirteenth Tale is a book that can turn a not so avid reader away because it doesn,t just jump right into the whole scheme of things ,You use your thoughts alot trying to figure out the next thing to happen ,I loved this book,now it is making the rounds at work ,read it ,you will enjoy it!!"
2,I hate to pick it up!,Another overly wordy book. There is nothing that motivates me to pick this up and read. I am about one third of the way through it and keep hoping it will get better.
4,Great debut with twists and turns,"The Thirteenth Tale revolves around Margaret Lea, a book collector's daughter who works in the family bookstore and occasionally writes biographies. Margaret is summoned out of the blue by world famous author Vida Winter to write her biography. Until then, Vida's true life story had been a carefully guarded secret of great public interest. Vida quickly draws Margaret and the reader in with her suspenseful story full of scandal, murder and intrigue. Diane Setterfield does a wonderful job of setting the dark, gothic tone of the novel and introducing many twists and turns that I did not see coming. I would have given this book a much higher rating had it not been for the sub-plot regarding Margaret's obsession over a twin that died at birth. I found the story line a detraction from an otherwise decent book. Other than the sub-plot, an entertaining and quick read."
5,A story of stories,"A wonderful read. It is real page turner but not your typical page turner. Its a story about stories plus lots more. Its part mystery, part a celebration of literature. I loved it and highly recommend it."
3,It was OK,"I expected a more dramatic ending, but I was disappointed. I felt the book was too long and the ending didn't live up to the promise made earlier in the book. Worth a read, but don't expect to be wowed."
4,Lots of loose ends,"I enjoyed this book. It was very clever. But you need to be able to tolerate an ambiguous ending. There are multiple ways to interprete what was real. Ultimately, only the author knows as the characters either didn't know themselves or failed to elucidate all the details.You may find it difficult to even decide what decade Vida and Margaret were in while Vida was telling her story to Margaret.Author makes fun references to multiple other novels such as Jane Eyre, The Woman in White, and The Turn of the Screw. Is that a real ""ghost"" or not?Identities are a real theme throughout. No matter how carefully you read this book the first time, I doubt even the most astute will see the ending coming.Did Vida tell Margaret the truth? Did Vida even know the truth?"
5,Save it for a winter's day,"The 13th Tale is a story about storytelling and if you have an imagination stocked with classic English literature, you'll sink down into it with pleasure.This is one of those books you buy several copies of just to give out as gifts to reader-friends. I read it in the midst of a hot Australian summer, but it's the sort of book you should save for winter, a chair by the fire, a mohair rug on your knee, a cup of tea and the whole day ahead of you just to read - no interruptions. You won't put it down."
1,Disappointing,"I was very excited when I started this novel. It seemed to have all the ingredients for an uplifting experience. But no, the more it developed, the more it lost its potential. The characters became completely absurd, the story contorted and not so intelligent. Overall it made me feel that I was waisting my time. I have to give credit to a sometimes evocative and poetic writing. Too bad."
3,Contrived and overblown,"Seriously, I can't believe all the stellar reviews. The book is fine-- lots of twists and turns, but way too long and all the little snippets and hints are laboriously pointed out within the book. Heavyhanded and contrived are good words to describe the book-- doesn't mean it's a total waste, just not a work of note. It's also kind of annoying in how hard it tries to pull together all the strings of the story. . And I am SO tired of authors dropping titles like ""Jane Eyre"" in their novels, as if hoping that the genius of the former somehow rubs off on the latter. It doesn't. It makes you sound 13. I definitely didn't lose myself in this one. I honestly would have stopped reading it if it wasn't for the fact that my book club was reading it."
2,I can't believe I have to finish reading this book...,If you like reading books with a zillion old english references that you will have NO CLUE of their meaning..... Then this book is for you. What a weird depressing novel. 10 bucks and a few hours I'll NEVER see again.
2,"Unfortunately, I think this book is highly overrated","I wanted to like it. I did. It gets great reviews, and it seems like the kind of book I'd enjoy. But all it has going for it is a meandering and anachronistic plot, a cast of characters that are ultimately unrealistic and cliched, and a finale that is not so much moving as it is dull and devoid of meaning.The main difference between the protagonist and the characters the author aspires to have her be like is that she lacks a personality and any kind of gumption. She's a dull, plodding spinster with no interests, talents, or friends, and I found it impossible to engage with her in any way. As for the mysterious and extraordinary novelist...well, I'd rather have written any of the novels that SHE wrote than this one. They sounded far more interesting."
1,Had to read this for classes,I had to read this book for my college reading class. I think it was one of the wrose books the school could have picked for us to read. The book is badly written and should have never printed. If I thougth it would help I would ask for my money back. I don't know how old Margaret or Vida are. I don't know what time period this story takes place in. I think the story lines are very odd and boring. The only reason the book is this long is because the writer doesn't know how to make a point quickly.
1,couldn't get through it,"this story was so slow. I eventually put it down and didnt finish reading it(and I never do that). The author uses words beautifully, if only she could write a story that went somewhere and kept the reader interested."
3,Worth the read.,"I enjoyed the classic style tale of twisted family secrets. It was a bit slow at times, overly descriptive- but if you can endure those small slow bits, the rest is definitely worth the read. Not exactly the ghost story you think it may be- if you are looking for the paranormal ghost."
4,Let me tell you a story....,"This book may start off a little slow for some people, but it's worth the entire ride. It starts out quaint and slow, then works its way to mysterious. You realize that the characters have some secrets. At the end these secrets are revealed, not to mention some harrowing surprises. The end has more twists and turns than many novels that I've read. Once I got to the end I can truly say this novel grabbed me. If you like mystery and surprises, this is it!"
4,Good Read,I liked this book -- I found it had enough of a mystery to it to hold my attention and kept me wanting to come back and read it more. We read this for a book club and everyone enjoyed it. Has some good twist and turns.
4,Great read!,I really enjoyed this book - it's very well-written and a really interesting story. It holds your attention from the first page and is full of intrigue and suspense. It really is a must-read!
4,Keeps you reading,"With many twists and turns, Setterfield keeps you going throughout the novel. Though I found the bits of story about the narrator to be a bit weird and perhaps unnecessary, the main plotline--the real story within the story--is great. Whenever I thought I knew what was going on, something else came up that changed my perspective entirely, keeping me on my toes."
2,did not finish,"I did not finish this book because, although the writing is good, the characters Isabelle and Charlie introduced early on are just so evil that I don't want to let them into my imagination. Of course it is fiction, but for me, the things I read enter and inform my mind, and this is a dark direction I am not in the mood for."
2,Not so much,"I found this book boring in the sense that their seemed to be to much of it.The premise is interesting-the twist*no spoilers*got me-but by the time we get to the end of the story I found myself asking do I really care?This book has been compared to Jane Eyre-Don""t believe it!Or the hype that this book has.I guess all in all this book left me a little empty and wishing I had the time back that it took me to read(listen) to it."
4,Interesting Book,"I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 only because it wasn't as riveting as I thought it might be. It's an interesting story, and I'd say that if you enjoyed Jane Eyre, you'd enjoy this book. The main character seems a little odd at first, mainly because she is so isolated and has no friends whatsoever. I got used to her, though, and the book reads pretty easily. I had a theory about the ending that was close to correct, so it may not be a surprise ending for everyone. Still, though, it's a good book and a nice way to pass a rainy afternoon."
5,Saint Tail strikes again!,"This DVD is FILLED with comedy,action and some somewhat suspense.Like if Saint Tail will be captured by Asuka or someone else.Or if he finds out she [Meimi Haneoka]is Saint Tail. Basically Saint Tail helps others who she hears lost thier doll on top of a castle or if someone stole a diamond.Her friend [Siera Mimori] tells her about these things because,since she is a nun in training,people come to pray that it would return to them.Personaly,I think this is a great DVD and I would love to have it myself [I saw it at my friends].Also it is a very fun cartoon to draw.I hope whoever is reading this review will consider buying this DVD and I hope you like it!!"
1,Run away from this piece of junk.,"I only gave this thing 1 star because I couldn't give it 0 stars.This thing is pure GARBAGE. This piece of junk turned what should have been about a 2 hour amplifier install in my 2007 Wrangler into a 3 day ordeal. (I should have given up after an hour, but I am a hard headed individual.) The connectors are so shoddy that any movement causes at least 1 or more wires to come out, forcing you to start over. I used 3 different gauges of wire, tried taping over the connectors, tried soldering the connections, NOTHING worked.Finally, I put the piece of junk next to my seat, where God and everybody could see it, so that I could reconnect the wires as they inevitably came out. I then ordered the Pac-Soem 4 channel converter, waited for it to come in, hooked it up, and put it under the dash.Problem solved, amp installed, no wires coming apart, amp and all associated wiring hidden from view.DON""T BUY THIS ITEM!!!! You have been warned."
1,"Bad Design, Poor Build Quality","The electrical qualities of this unit are irrelevant, as its build quality is so poor that you're likely to break it during installation. The use of screw terminals was a bad design choice, as most users of this device are going to need to splice into something and will need wire leads. I ended up cutting and stripping several 9-inch leads out of the blue ""remote turn on"" wire that comes with amp kits. Unfortunately this was for naught as the screw terminals are extremely easy to strip and there appeared to be no amount of torquing that was enough to hold the wires but that did not strip the block. If you are going to use this unit, expect that you may need to solder your leads onto the terminal block.I ended up picking up aPAC SOEM-4which did the job. It was a little bit bigger, but had built-in leads."
3,Video shots don't support the point,"I found this video of only marginal help in improving my game. Bollettieri is too hyper and dogmatic, and all too often the videos don't back up the point being made. For example, he tells you a strategy to win a point. Then the players in the video who are supposed to illustrate what he wants them to do, end the point by hitting the ball out. In addition there are numerous instances where a serve or shot is clearly out but the players continue to play. I expected better from Bollettieri, one of the best in the business."
2,"Not bad for the price, but better software is out there","This software is OK--it's affordable, to be sure. But it's notthat great from a teaching perspective--it's just a flashcard system.A much better foreign-language software program is Smart Start German (which Amazon.com also sells). I think that's a better way to learn German, actually--although this software is fine if all you want to do is learn vocabulary."
2,It sounded pretty good but...,"I purchased this program as my girlfriend is German and I thought I would take a shot at learning a few words. Well that's about all you will get from this Cd Set a few words. The first Cd provides you with just enough German to make a fool of yourself in an airport in Frankfurt. I wasn't looking to master the German language, but I was hoping for a little more. Still for [$] it at least teaches you to look for something better."
2,Not Impressed,"This product arrived quickly, but despite previous reviews and giving it a month to work I've seen no improvement with puffiness or squint lines."
5,Beautiful and Important,"This is an absolutely astonishing look at the lives of the mentally ill in Southern Brazil. The author writes with passion, conviction and determination to bring humanity to the most inhumane and forgotten places on earth. The stories of the people in Vita compel you to examine the structures of your own society, who we readily throw-away for making us uncomfortable or not fulfilling social norms. With every page, your compassion and empathy grows for the people who are desperately misunderstood, misdiagnosed and mistreated by a society who responds to uncommon behaviors with social quarantines. It begs the question of whether individuals are crazy, or if life and all of the structures in place which dictate our lives are the root of instability and unpredictability."
5,Wise and Wise-Cracking,"I have only heard Ms. Russell once, on NPR. It was her analysis of Wagner's ""Ring"" epic. I did not stop laughing all the way through. She is tremendously funny, and now that I know her name (I had forgot it) I shall buy all of her albums. She brings an interest and knowledge of music to the average layman, along with a brilliant sense of humour. She has nothing but approbation from me!"
3,3 1/2,See book description above.The conclusion almost made up for the rather less than gripping majority of the novel. The timeliness and some of the twists made it worth reading but I hope for a better novel on the next go round. I noticed a few errors in editing also.
5,Love This,"I like this toy a lot. It is very cute and teaches numbers. My daughter would like to play with real money, but the coins are too small, so I bought her this. She is very happy playing with it."
3,Possibly good for older kids. But sound is too weak,"Saw so many good reviews on this product so had to get this.It has a song mode, and counting mode.When nose is being pushed, it make sound.But the thing is that, the speaker that gives out sound is under pig's chin.So it's really really hard to hear the sound.Tail?When nose is being pushed, it makes sounds but tail? Nothing.If there is many blinking light for nose or/tail, it might have been nice.Or even a sound of pig would be a good add on.Not for 9 month.My baby is 9 month and still can't really stack things by himself so I am sure it's too early for him to be introduced to this toy.However, as an adult who tried this toy,Educational value?DefinitelyBut the sound loudness, and many add on features need to be improved."
4,Fun for 1 and 3yr old,We wanted a toy that will work on fine-motor skills that was also fun. This toy fit both requirements. Both my kids love to put coins in and hear the sound when it drops in.
5,Educational,"My son won't put it down. It's great for teaching colors, numbers and counting. He is drawn to real money which I don't allow him to play with so this is a great toy."
2,Doesn't old interest for very long,"This is a cute toy when you are looking at it to buy, however, the door on ours falls off all the time which is a bit frustrating. I have a 13 month old, 15 month old, 28 month old. They liked it the first couple of days - I have even tried putting it away and bringing it out a few months later (I like to rotate toys) and they just don't show interest for longer than a few minutes. Basically just taking up space right now. Cute idea though!"
1,Questions,Is there concern about choking hazards such as the children placing the coins in their mouths? I read some of the reviews and have not seen a description of the size of the coins or any safety issues? Is there another place to ask questions?
3,Cute but a little flimsy,"I bought this toy for my daughter last week when she turned one. It's really cute, and even my 2 and 4 year old boys like it. One thing I do love is that the volume is LOW! It's so refreshing to have a toy that doesn't annoy the &^%* out of us!However, my two year old pulled the door off with no effort at all. He just reached over and popped it off. Now every time I snap it back on (it does snap in easily), it doesn't stay. It falls off constantly and drives me crazy.But other than that, it's a cute toy."
3,"My kids liked it, but problems with the door","My twins really liked this toy at first, but it was a bit frustrating for them because they found the door hard to open to get the coins back out. After a couple of weeks, it seemed to loosen up and was easier to open, but then a couple of months later, the door wouldn't stay closed, so if you picked it up with coins in it, the door would come open and they would go all over the place. It was very annoying, so we eventually got rid of it. I'm really disappointed it didn't hold up better."
4,Great toy for babies and toddlers,My son has loved this toy since he was 5 months old. He's now 2 and still playing with it and having fun. It helps teach counting and colors.
5,Very Useful in the circumstance of it's use.,"Given the opportunity to review this product myself, it was bought as a gift. However, I was told that it is very useful in brushing up on the skills needed to pass those college classes and is a great practice tool. We do recommend this product."
2,Kinda Short,"Short, fake looking, the handle is too small for a real hand. I would not buy this again, it is lame and fake looking. Did fine as a costume prop for a cartoon pirate."
5,A Great album,"Donny Hathaway(Self-titled album 1971 - Atlantic/Rhino CD 1993)This CD is excellent. This one is not as thematic as his ""Everything is Everything"" album, but every song is magnificent and the two bonus tracks on this Rhino CD made the album even better.The more Donny Hathaway music you have, the better your collection will be, but this album is mandatory for a proper collection.This is a Five Star CD"
5,sour cream powder,Excellent product. I used it on a sea kayaking trip and all five of us were amazed at the excellent texture and flavor. One package lasted for 2 Mexican food meals for five hungry paddlers in British Columbia. I do have doubts that it would serve as well with warm water.
1,Disappointed,This mill certainly looks good but does not work in humid environments. Contacting the distributor for help is a waste of time.
3,Just an introduction to the SIP RFC,"This book simply summarizes some of the SIP RFC into more user-friendly english. It consists mostly of lists of SIP headers and error codes, lifted from the RFC. There is no sample code or discussion of SIP applications or architecture. Of course, the RFC is pretty hefty, so this book has been a useful introduction. I still use the RFC as my real reference, though, because there are some minor discrepancies between the book and the RFC, such as some error code names."
3,Not very pleasing,"When I first picked up this book it sounded really interesting. Jenny Jakes and her mother Madeline Jakes, a famous mystery writer, go to San Antonio Texas for the birthday/will reading of Arnold Harmony, a distant billionare cousin and owner of Harmony Chocolates. Right before the actually reading of the will a murder occurs follwed by yet another murder. Everyone expects Madeline to solve the mystery, but Jenny knows her mother could NEVER solve a mystery. The plot started out good, but became more boring and predictible with each page turn. Jenny's romance with Carlos the bellhop is somewhat unbelivable as is Madeline's with the police officer. And while Madeline's way of solving the mystery and getting information is humorous it soon gets to down-right unbelivable. If you're looking for a good read I suggest you try and one of Lois Dincan's books. This one is slopply done and barely deserves 3 stars."
2,"Good for playing and analysing, nothing else",If you want to buy a strong chess program to play against and get some analysis then Fritz 8 is the thing.However if you want a traing program which gives you awsome training options (Fritz 8 does have these options but they are CRAP) and great game analysing with a lot of comments and explanations (Fritz 8 only tells you the obvious things) then go for Chessmaster 9000.Fritz 8 for playing against and analysing with not so good comments.Chessmaster 9000 for anything else. Chessmaster is much better.
2,Drips like the others,Bought specifically for homebrewing. baster drips like all the others . dont waste your money.I would suggest buying a cheaper one.
2,Piece of Junk,If this was suppose to be a horror movie. IT'S NOT. The only good scene in the entire movie for me was the wrestling / fight scene. I love seeing a woman and a man wrestle especially if the woman is kicking the mans butt. Sadly this movie doesn't have hardly have any of that. There is alot of reminiscing between the couple taking us back in time when times were not so bad between the two of them. I really didn't find that to be useful. When I saw the previews of this DVD I saw the fight scenes and for me that is why I bought the DVD. But it even fails at that.
4,Good book for beginners,"Tamilee guides you through figuring out what your body type is and what sports might be suited for you.Where she excels, though is on working out different parts of the body, like specific toning exercises for your arms or legs, which are very effective, especially if you use weights.She explains the correct form and considering this is a book, it's quite well done. All in all, a good book if you're getting started."
1,An Unpleasant Experience,I like movies alot I have a ton of them. But this movie just made me feel sick and empty. Not even worth renting.
1,Not worth your time or money.,"Ordinarily, I would recommend renting a film that I consider pretty awful instead of wasting hard earned money buying it. But this dreadful piece of crap isn't worthy of a $3.00 rental fee. The Director and Director of Photography have absolutely no idea of what they're doing. The sound quality is abyssmal and the bad eidting decisions are mind-boggling. It all adds up to a completely unprofessional foray into what I would define as ""cable access"" moviemaking. Avoid this dreadful garbage and save yourself the frustration of trying to understand what essentially amounts to an incomprehensible telling of a laughably silly story."
3,the teenaged Youssou N'Dour,"Very short (less than 28 minute) CD recorded in a Dakar nightclub in 1978. A few tracks feature the teenaged Youssou N'Dour. Not bad music, but hard to imagine that this CD would have a lot of appeal for non-Senegalese. The follow-up, Volume 2: Thiapathialy is longer, more accessible, and better recorded."
5,great peppermill,"I love pepper. I have pepper mills from Germany, Switzerland, and more. This is a nice compact pepper mill for fresh ground pepper at all times."
1,Wrong item received,Not only was the wrong item received (salt shaker in white instead of the black matte pepper mill) but it looks like it was already used. It was filled with some pepper already.
5,Awesome Deal,I bought this set for $40 shipped. The knives are firm and sharp. No one can believe what I paid for them.
3,Hype Hype Hype,"Excavate this. I get far more enjoyment, satisfaction, moral lessons, and inspiring examples from reading great novels like ""The Triumph and the Glory"", Stones From the River"", or ""Sophie's Choice"" than I've ever gotten from one of these motivational books. Can't anyone think for themselves any more ? Can't we draw our own wisdom and insight from our own life experiences ? Do we really need gimmicky books that claim that every stage of life we go through conveniently starts with the letter 'S' ? ? ? I wish everyone would just start using their common sense instead of seeking every answer to every problem from the highest selling 20 or 30 self-help books. Gee whiz, people!"
2,"Disappointing, and a little dangerous","This book seems to be the author's written justification for her own quest for self-actualization. That's fine, but the residual anger left over from her own divorce permiates this book, and, if the autor's message on marriage is to be believed, 1) self-fulfillment can not be found in a happy marriage, 2) in order to find one's self, one must stike out alone (divorced, of course), and 3) husbands, no matter how pure and genuine their motives may seem, actually only want to control their wives. Granted, this book is not only about marriage, and in many ways, it is good, in that it encourages introspection. But if one's desire for SOMETHING MORE is based in problems with a marriage relationship, there are MANY better, more objective books, including Iris Krasnow's Surrendering to Marriage."
2,"Not Enough ""Abundance"" in Something More","Having followed the ""Simple Abundance"" path for many years, I was excited to see a new book. Unfortunately, there was little additional information presented. I would only recommend this for those caught in a traumatic life change. Otherwise, read her first book, and stop there."
5,Sacred,"Kevin Wood's Sacred CD is exactly that. It is such a wonderful blend of cultures, instruments and voices, that I play it over and over, especially in the car. It has a real grounding effect, while soothing at the same time. I find it very uplifting."
2,Does not fit correctly,When I received the top and went to install it on the folding bookshelf it became apparent that it would not fit properly due to the fact that the holes were drilled in the wrong place. A friend had to take it and redrill it to make it work.
2,Does not fit Yu Shan folding bookcase,This mantel top by itself is well made and looks fine. Perhaps it is designed to fit something else.I purchased this mantel top because was listed on Amazon together with the Yu Shan 3 shelf folding bookcase.I naturally assumed the two pieces would fit together. They do not. I had to drill two new holes on the mantel top to make the two fit together. Amazon should be more careful about how it pairs products for sale.
5,Battle of the century,"The long awaited fight between Goku and Vegeta finally climaxes when Vegeta deliberately lets Babidi take control of his body and mind. He then continues to destroy helpless civilians while fueling Goku's rage. Vegeta having grown tired of the same mundane life wishes to travel back to his beginning episode stages where his heart was pure evil and his only concern was to be the strongest fighter in the galaxy. He tells Goku why everything has come to this point and they are transported to another plain to begin the battle. Meanwhile, Gohan attempts to destroy the bubble containing Majin Buu, but to no avail. This is the greatest number of episodes the series has seen to date. A must have for all Dragonball Z fans!"
5,Great old style stories for young readers!,"Great old fashion book for my young reader, it is great to not have to worry about what kind of stuff they have in these kind of books. I homeschool so it was a great added fun book for our library!"
4,Takes up where Will and Ariel Durant left off.,"Will and Ariel Durant's classic ""Story of Civilization"" only got as far as 1815 and Napoleon's conquests and defeats. Paul M. Johnson's ""Birth of the Modern"" takes up where the Durants left off, and covers ""world society"" from 1815 to 1830. Though Johnson's conservative bias colors his narrative, he does a good job covering an important era in world history. Since Johnson already did the 20th century, he should fill in the gaps by writing a book or books to cover the years from 1830 to 1919."
3,"Decent book, not great","I have a two year old son with another one on the way. Trying to get across the concept that ""the end of the world as he knows it is fast approaching"" is not an easy one, so I turned to a number of books such as this one.The pictures are done quite nicely, but my big complaint is that the text itself doesn't make a lot of sense to me. When reading this book to our son, we frequently make up totally different words than what's written in the book. For example, I don't believe there's a single rhyme in the whole book.I do agree that the book does present some difficult situations that may trouble an older sibling (like the baby taking toys, etc.) But I would recommend instead something like ""The New Baby"" by Mercer Mayer"
4,Better Than You'd Expect,"This was a pretty even-handed treatment of Dr. Laura. Fitting a synopsis of anyone's life into one hour is a major challenge, but in this case you come away with a feeling that you've learned a little more about what makes her tick. My friends that love her say it was not nice enough, and those who hate her say it was too nice. That tells me it was probably fair."
4,Good for beginners.,This movie assists young boys in imaginative dance techniques. The instuctor does not use technical names for any of the movements but tells them basically to dance and move in story form. It is great for learning the movement but would need real instruction to learn correct names etc.... After each child student segment there is and older dancer showing the correct way to do it.
3,"Nice grind, but not as heavy duty as i expected...","I bought this grinder after hearing good things about the brand and I have to say I'm a little disappointed. The grind adjustment feature is sort of a byproduct of the design and not a feature in itself. Also, the top ""gear"" seems to rotate off the top of the grinder because the internal grinding mechanism is not fixed in its place. Other than that, the grind is consistent and terrific. The piece is visually pleasing, but I'm a cook and I look for utility before appearance. All in all I'd say it is worth the money especially compared to some of the ones at Williams-Sonoma."
2,Fidji Pepper Mill,"Even though we like the style, we are somewhat disappointed in this product. Its grinding mechanism seems to be different from another Peugeot mill (Paris model, I believe) that we have and have been very impressed with. The grind from it seems to be much smoother and easier to control. I was under the impression that all their mechanisms are a similar design, but now am not sure."
4,great gift,My youngest likes some of the retro titles for the PS2 and Rampage is one of his favorites. We had a copy that wouldn't play anymore so I started searching and found a great copy! I thought I would expand on the original with this sequel title for his birthday.
2,Exactly . . . Something to Be Desired,"This book leaves you feeling just as the title says. Or maybe the title should've been, Something Left Out, or better yet it should have been titled, Boring."
5,ZEBRA'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK........,"SO GLAD AUTHOR DREWRY WAS OBVIOUSLY GIVEN SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM ZEBRA PUBLISHING. THIS REFLECTS HOW PROMISING HISTORICAL ROMANCE IS. ALTHOUGH I CAN FIND PLACES TO NITPICK, I CHOOSE NOT TO BECAUSE OVERALL, THE BOOK HAS IT ALL. THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED......THE PLOT HAS SEVERAL ARMS OF INTEREST.....THE DIALOGUE IS NATURAL AND WITTY. THIS IS NOT A NOBEL PRIZE BOOKS BUT IT SURE IS AN ENJOYABLE AND DELIGHTFUL READ.......AND YOU CAN RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT EXCERPTING ANY EMBARRASSING MOMENTS....ENJOY........"
2,Save your money if you want to be a writer,"I have owned or bought most of Bob Bly's books over the years. They are well written, interesting reading and enticements of fortune are good ego boosters. But don't bank on making $100,000 a year without heavy duty college and extensive experience. In which case you wouldn't be buying a book like this to begin with. Save your money for college."
3,A good saw but there are better,"Let me start by saying I have a Hitachi c8fb2, but I needed a 10"" saw for my other crew who needs to cut 4X4's regularly. I was on the job the other day and used this saw and was not very impressed. It is a good saw has an electronic break which is a nice feature, but the motor just did not seem to run as smooth as the Hitachi.Let me also state that I ordered it through the tool king and they were advertising it as new and it is defiantly not new - the zero clearance insert had cuts on it when I got it. For almost half the price I kind of figured it was a recon, but it was still a good deal since PC's warrantee is the same for recon or new - 1 year.Overall the crew likes it for now, but I will probably replace it with a 10"" Hitachi next time around.BTW - the dust bag and port are useless more dust goes on the floor. the port is always clogged, so nothing gets to the bag."
4,Cool CD about cool car,"I am not tom-boy but I love one car the Mustang.My Favorite is the 69 429 Boss.Before I loved the 01-02mustang.When I got this CD i fell in love with the boss!Althought the Cd is missing a little information in some areas I still recomend this CD,for a mustang lover!!!..."
3,good value but not a bargain,I recieved this knife set today. I am happy with the quality for the money but it is far from a gormet set of knives. They are made in China although the ad at Amazon did not say this. They also shipped me an extra steak knife and left out the paring knife.
4,Very pleasing return,"The last thing I expected was another wonderful album from the Band. The last wonderful album from them had appeared more than 20 years ago. Excellent choice of material, the usual solid musicianship, sympathetic work from the new members and guest stars like Champion Jack Dupree. This picks up where Stage Fright left off. A solid choice if you already know and like the Band, or if you've never heard them before"
2,.......disappointed,"ok, i got my own studio. people come through and record. (duh) but sum ppl come through and I adjust it for this tall guy..... and bam the lil plastic piece is broken. it worked for a long little while, but go ahead and get you a nice one and not hafta get a new one like me."
3,Nice but too heavy,"These are very attractive and would probably work great as appetizer picks, but I find them too heavy for martinis."
5,no problem,"I've had this saw for a couple of years now. It is time to review it. I had no problem setting it up, everything was square and true right off the bat. I've mounted it on a portable work station and put it in the corner when not in use. Everytime I unfold the work station the saw has been square. I use it for cabinet trim and have never had a joint that didn't fit. The 40 tooth blade that came with it was good for rough cuts, but I got an additional 80 tooth blade for the fine cuts. My only compliant is; my neighbors found out that the saw is portable, now I have to come up with reasons for them not to borrow it for too long of a period."
1,Book is not arrival with poor Amazon customer service,"Book was not arrival. I contacted to the Amazon customer service and they said item sent out already calling me to wait. now, it was over one year, the item was still on it's way. Customer service did not follow it up like refund or re-sending, I paid for item for nothing. it was very poor servicing by the Amazon' Customer service."
2,Jesus loves you,Lynyrd Skynyrd needs more songs than 47 songs. He is the greatest southern rocker of all time. I hope they come out with a better box set than this soon. I hope this review helped you and keep on listening to classic rock. God bless you all.
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"It has a nice colors and great image. Sound is not impressive. It has only 1 HDMI input, although the 1 S-Video, 2 component and VGA inputs are adequate. PC display works fine, but its highest resolution is only 1024x768. The remote control is really bad: it cannot control multiple devices and switching between TV modes is slow and sequential. It lacks of an auto-voltage regulator, which you should buy separately. After 6 months of minimal use I had go to repair it. In summary, the display is good but there are better options."
1,Akai TV,"My Akai TV quit 1 month after purchase. The customer support at Akai is dysfunctional and 3 months after the TV failed and dozens of frustrating phone calls, I still have not been able to get it replaced. If you buy an Akai product, be sure to get an extended warranty from the store where you purchased it and that the store, not Akai, will replace or fix the product unless you enjoy being recycled in the corporate backwash."
3,It's okay,I expected more.Explanations and exercises are not really cool.I would not recommend this book to students of hig school.
5,A treasure of a book,"For anyone interested in folk art, this book is a keeper. The author is a world-famous authority and the photographs are stunning."
2,Does not come wireless,I ordered this because it was wireless and when i received it was not wireless. Contacted the company and they said that it was not their problem and Amazon messed up.
4,Just right,"I wanted to get a simple computer for my bike. I didn't want any hassles or other complications. I set up the computer(1 year ago) and it has been running fine ever since.I really like the Temp on the monitor. I use it so that when I bike in the morning I know how to dress. If the sun is beating directly on the device it will not give you accurate Temp, but what can you expect. Any device would have this problem.Overall it's more than sufficient wireless bike computer for your average rider. It gives you mph, avg mph, max mph, ride time, ride distance, bike ODO, temp, time, Current ODO.Also great value."
2,We live in a world of better displays,Bike Computers need to keep up with other displays. This one is ok but kind of weak. The menu system was not very friendly either. Does it show you your speed and other stats? Yes it does if the light is perfect and you can see the tiny screen.
2,Will not fit on Tri bike,"I bought this computer for my husband's tri bike. We tried adapting it but could not make it fit on the bars and had to return it. Also, the magnet and sensor are very large compared to cateye. Not favorable!"
1,Too Thick and Heavy,"Please, look at the dimension and weight of this watch carefully.I retuurned this."
4,"Decent, but wrong picture","Pros:-Good sized helmet, might be a little on the small side for me.-Planning on doing work on it to repaint it for a costume for the Mandalorian Mercs, told it makes a good first helm for anyone on a budget.-Shipped quickly and good price.Cons:-Wrong picture!-Looks like it's going to be a lot more work than I initially thought as the tutorials I saw had much better looking helmets... The top is slightly out of shape and it doesn't shut all the way.-A bit painful to assemble, not sure if I can dismantle it without breaking it.-Discovered that the strength of the glue holding the Velcro on for the padding was not as strong as the strength of the Velcro itself when I tried to remove the padding.Other:-Any Mandalorian Mercs looking for a Rubies 2 piece helmet, this is it. It just goes by a different name.-Overall, I guess I got what I paid for, just wish they showed the right helmet pictures."
3,A little low key,"I've been a fan from the beginning (late 80s) but have not kept up with anything since Rush Street which I liked very much. When I heard a new album was coming out, I decided to get it. In my opinion, this album is somewhat too soft for my taste. I'm more into tracks like Satisfied, Too Late to Say Goodbye, Love Unemotional, etc. This is a result of the tracks being very rythm based while lacking in the lead category. He seems to have turned somewhat soft. There are a few upbeat tracks, but for the most part, saying this album rocks is inaccurate. The lyrics, however, are very well done."
2,Poor construction,"I usually rave about kitchenaid products, but this one has been problematic from day one. The little chrome handle fell off the first time I used it. A real pain to keep putting the turning handle back on. After the first few uses, the handle hinge broke off so that the grater had to be held together while attempting to use it. Too much pressure required to shred all but the softest cheese, and now, after less than a year, the crank broke off on one of the graters so the entire thing is USELESS...into the trash it went. I'm the eternal optimist so I'm gong to spring for the battery powered one I saw in another catalog. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,"Okay for hard cheeses, broke twice","I bought this because I was looking for an easier way to shred mozzarella cheese. I used tried all three blades, and was disappointed with the results. The fine blade, even though is designed for hard cheeses, worked best for all cheeses. Basically, I personally found the other two blades too much of a pain to bother with. The handle is awkward with no grip. Like the other reviewed mentioned, it is clumsy to use. The handle screws into the blade barrel. I stripped the treads on the handle while grating during normal use. (Won't turn, therefore, won't shred) KitchenAid was great and replaced the whole thing. Well, after a couple months more, the threads on my new one chipped during normal use, leaving the whole thing again useless. I didn't bother getting it replaced because it wasn't worth it.Before it broke, however, it did work okay for parmesan cheese."
1,Poor Quality,My grater broke after a year of occasional use. This is now the second plastic grater I have wasted my money on. I will spend the extra $$$ for a metal rotary grater now!
4,Very interesting,It's great to see this interview of one of the greatest innovators of our time. Steve Jobs will truly be missed.
4,Good story - audio more important than video,Very interesting interview that really portrays Steve Jobs.The quality of the video is relatively low as it's a scan of a VHS tape.
2,too big,"when I received this product, I open it, then I think it is too big for holding the fox urine, since a bottle of fox urine only 8 fl oz. so I didn't this product. it is not a good product."
4,ytd,"so far, I love this little product. Filled it full of mothballs and time will tell. so far, so good"
4,Only 1.5 mW,"I was hoping based on the higher price and class three rating that was originally advertized, that it would be closer to 5mW but only has output of 1.5mW. Other than that is is very durable and well made."
3,"Great Product, but potenially dangerous now","I've been using this product for a long time now, and I swore by it, it controlled the oil fairly well, and has good light coverage, and good natural color, but it has Vitamin A in it, which has been found to be potentially dangerous when combined with sunscreen, as explained on the EWG's Cosmetic Database. Lots of other sunblocks have been reformulated to not include the Vit. A. So Murad just needs to follow suit!!"
2,Old Wine in Used Skins,"My wife got me this book for XMAS thinking it would help. It didn't. It can be distilled down to two points everyone already knows:* Selling is job #1 in a startup. Forget about every other aspect of the business until you have a steady stream of sales.* Don't take on any fixed overhead until the sales are achieved.Thanks for the clarification, guys.*yawn*"
4,Best implement for cleaning indoor gas grilles,I'm so glad to find this wonderful item - it cleans the gas grille and vent-a-hood beautifully.
2,Too wimpy,The Mr Bar-B-Q Oversized Dual Grill Brush wire brush is too wimpy to clean the grate. The wires need to be a little shorter and a lot stiffer.
2,Too flimsy,"I tossed this after a couple uses for 3 reasons:1. The long plastic handle is not strudy enough and gives as you scrub the grate so there is not enough pressure applied to the grate for cleaning.2. The wire bristles are not stiff enough and also give when you scrub and after a couple uses they start falling off.3. There is no string or loop to hang the brush on the side of the grill. I know, not a huge deal and I could add my own, but a product like this should come with one."
1,"maybe I have a defective one, but........","I was quite pleased at first, but after 6 months its UNUSABLE.It SHEDS!!!!!Every time I use it now, I find tiny brass wire ""hairs"" on my food. I have found them small enough to not be seen and in my mouth. This is a disaster waiting to happen.BEWARE"
1,Doesn't Last,"Boils water just fine, but doesn't last. After 11 months, the switched failed. Sent in (under warranty) for repairs - they replaced the switch and got it back in three weeks. Worked fine for another six weeks, then failed again. Look elsewhere for quality."
5,Nice Kettle,"This kettle replaced our 3rd GE kettle.It holds a large amount of water, boils fast, and is easy to fill.We are happy with it."
1,only lasted nine months,"After nine months the flip-style plastic lid no longer sealed properly, leading to the risk of overboiling. I didn't bother to send it in for repair because the design is clearly flawed and it would have simply needed repair another nine months later.Fairly skimpy materials and design for the price."
3,lasts just long enough for the warranty to run out,"I liked it, I used it every day, but now it is tired. Will not stay on long enough to boil the water. Bought it 2/9/09, now it's 3/4/10. RIP"
1,"Workd well, then quit","This kettle worked well, although noisily, for about nine months. Then it just quit. The indicator light would glow when turned on, but the water was ont heated. I would not buy this model again."
3,"Love the concept, workmanship needs help",I never actually got to use this in my house. After they shipped me three they stopped trying. Each time it arrived one end was broken off. If they revamp this product I would buy it.
3,Threads don't match my impulse head,"I like the design, weight and inherent stability of this product. My one MAJOR complaint is that it comes fine threaded and my standard rainbird impulse head would not screw in until I bought a 14 pitch tap (another $11) to make suitable threads to screw into. I have no idea why it would not have the same thread pitch as a very common impulse head. Otherwise it is a superior design that will never tip over and will last a lifetime."
5,"Almost indescribable, but I'll try...","This is the first Mary Alice Kruesi book that I have read, but it won't be the last. I picked up this book after a wretched day, and felt soothed immediately after reading the first chapter. MAK's writing is light, lyrical and a pleasure to read - I liken it to a puff of fresh spring air blowing over me. I enjoyed every aspect of this book - Laurel and Dane's slowly evolving relationship, the connection between Maybelle and Laurel and the fantasy aspects - but I loved Laurel's character the most. Laurel's life was mired in the safety of a practical, goal oriented life before she took a big risk which she struggled with throughout the entire book that opened up her life and soul.Normally, I read either historicals (Balogh, Quinn, Garwood), humourous contemps (SEP, Gibson) or romatic suspense (Nora, Howard or Johansen), but I gave One Summer's Night a chance, and I hope others do also."
5,The best relaxing bath ever!,Highly recommended for relaxation! Once you try a warm kneipp herbal bath you will never be happy with any other brand of bath product. Great fragrances for the nose and herbal tonic for the body.
3,older than dirt,I am grateful for the information in this little manual.would have preferred that the copy was not so old and a discarded book from a library.I am sure most of the information was valid but equally sure that there probably have many additions to newer editions.
5,Great weatherstrip adhesive for your car.,I used to reattach the door stripping of my Ford Escape and it works great. Follow the instructions on the tube as this adhesive begins drying and being tacky the moment it hits the air. Definitely worth the extra money.
2,READ carefully.,"Twice as expensive as Kirkland. The ingredients list makes it seem as if each tablet contined the amounts mentioned, 750Mg, 600mg, etc. Not so. It is actually half of that.It takes 4 tablets per day to get 1500 mg Glucosamine. 2 capsules per serving, but two servings per day are required.It takes 2 Kirkland tabs per day."
5,relief,Have had pain in joints for a year now. Noticed a difference after three or four days and only took half of the dose that was needed. So far no side affects and it is nice to work in yard and play with grandchildren and not hurt for days after. Wish I would have found this sooner. I did notice that when I have been busy and unable to take the product some of the pains have come back upon 3 days so it doesn't work miracles. :)
4,Good product but low dosage,"This product has only 28mg of sodium from the condroitin. I wanted a low sodium product. I carry the capsules in my pocket in a pill box and it holds up excellently, even in the hottest weather. It has no after-affects on me whatsoever.I have been on this type of supplement for a number of years now, so I have relegated my dosage to maintenance levels. This is normally half dosage, in this case two capsules per day instead of four. I have found out that the quality of this product permits me to take only one capsule per day. With my previous product, I could not do this, so in the long run I was spending more then.With four capsules per day, this product provides more latitude for fine tuning dosages than some products that have only two capsules per day. For me, it works just fine. For someone who needs all four capsules per day, it may cost more per day, but you may need only three. For cost reasons, I down-rated it by one star."
1,Cheaper at Sam's Club and less pills!,I hate taking pills more than once a day. Unfortunately I didn't realize that this product only has 750 mg Glucosamine so two tablets twice a day. The Sams Club brand I usually buy is 1500mg so I don's take it once a day. Next time i won't be too lazy to drive to the store.
3,Product Evalauation,"I found a more appropriate, better priced product for my requirements. I needed to returned the item and purchase from another vendor"
4,Good value on pointers,"We already owned one of these so I knew what I was getting when I ordered. They are to be used in college Physics classes and should have the ruggedness to survive this kind of use, but, of course, time will tell. Given the price it seems to be a good buy."
1,Laser pointer,"That is not I wanted...I wanted a BLUE LIGHT laser pointer, not the blue body.So it means the product image and information of the product is misleading!"
2,Not really a green laser pointer,I picked this because it says it was a green laser pointer. The laser is red. The rubber grip is green. FALSE ADVERTISING!
2,GOOD AS A COLLECTION OF BONUS TRACKS,"This isn't a REAL album, since it's been released after Stevie's tragic death.Despite some VERY good moments as ""Little wing"", ""Chitlins con carne"" and ""Life by the drop"", IMO, the Cd suffers a bit from lack of consistency, with songs that were left out of the REAL Stevie's great recordings.Another low point is that some of the songs are very similar to other song issued on other CDs with changed lyrics.I strongly recommend ""Couldn't stand the weather"" to anyone who wants to listen to a passionate work from this great musician.His guitar never sounded so strong and sparkling as on CSTW, but there are some moments of real fun and passion on this one too."
5,Perfect for me,"the jewel case was broken but the CD has no scratches, plays perfectly. I did not need the jewel case."
5,sturdy,I use one of these in my shower every day and they hold up very well. After 4 years of daily use to squeegee the shower door there are no defects in the rubber. Others I have used get a divot right in the middle of them but the Ettore rubber holds up well.
4,car carrier,"The product worked well. We had researched other car top carriers on the web, most of which were much higher priced. The Highland was very roomy. We used three tie downs in addition to the straps attached to the pack. Drove in a pouring rain--no leaks. We are happy with our purchase."
1,not durable,I purchased the Kar Pak carrier for use on a 3000 mile road trip. The tie downs did not last 1500 miles before the two in front began to rip out and I had to use a racheting tiedown to secure the load. I packed 7 sleeping bags and 2 tents in the bag and the bottom of the bag wore through in several small spots. I would return it but no longer posess the box or the reciept.
2,broke second time using it,"The second time I used this roof carrier, one strap ripped out entirely, another two were just about gone. Good thing I checked it mid trip. Amazon did a great job replacing it. But I haven't had a chance to use it again since then. Hopefully I just got a bad one."
2,Great for only one or two time use!,"I originally had written a great review after a one time use with this. However; now that we've used it three times, we are VERY disappointed! It is quiet and roomy BUT it is already ripping and the zipper isn't holding up either. We don't even put much in it so this shows how poorly made it is. My husband doesn't think we'll be able to use it again. Very disappointed in the quality!"
5,Free up space in your vehicle,"This carrier worked great for us. We used it when we were traveling over Christmas, so it was jam-packed full of stuff. All of our presents and belongings were well protected from the elements. The best thing about it though, is that it frees up space in your vehicle. My husband said that it was really easy to use. We used it on our Jeep Cherokee and on our Town and Country minivan. It attached easily to both racks."
5,Very Pleased,"Used for a week long trip to Disney, was able to fit luggage for 4 adults and 2 children, held up very well, stopping to check straps on carrier a couple of times, stayed tight entire trip. Would highly recommend."
5,Kar Pak Highland 10391 soft-sided car top carrier,"I was hesitant to make this purchase. I thought it would tear apart as I traveled down the highway at speeds of 70-80 miles per hour. What a wonderful surprise. We drove from PA to Fl over 1,000 miles with a few showers along the way. Our cargo arrived in perfect condition and dry. The car carrier looked like new with the exception of some bug splatters which cleaned up easily. I was also afraid that it would damage my car paint, it did not. One strap end begain to flap in the wind (you will know if this happens,it is noisy), we pulled over and wrapped some string around it and solved that problem. The carrier was worth every penny and then some. So, if you need extra space..........buy one"
5,Nice brush,I like this thing. Such a feeling of power over such crusty grates. And fun to use? You bet!
2,Quite boring,"This book contains endless lists of names and dates that might be interesting if you are interested in English geneology, but you have to looks for information on heraldry. There are also cumbersome descriptions of things that should have been illustrated in pictures."
3,Would've liked it more if it had worked properly.....,"This was my first - and worst mp3 player. Bought this at Toysrus on sale price (20.00). Here's what I think of it:Pros:Easy-to-use mp3 loading system (just drag and drop using Windows explorer)O.K. sound quality - but use better headphones. The ones they provide are crud...Easy to read screenCons:Extremely frustrating owner's guideFelt cheap when I held itDidn't hold more than 60 songsThe menu screen is confusingThe major problem:Every time I tried loading a song with vocal into this, the device wiped the vocal clean out of the song. Also, the company itself no longer exists so (they changed names - now Nextar)when I went back to see if they had anymore for a replacement, Toysrus said they wouldn't be getting anymore in. I wasted 40 dollars on this company (also bought one for my younger brother and his broke after using it for only 2 days!)...!"
1,Stuck with the refill but no brush,"I ordered the brush and refill. The refill came first and was told the brush was on backorder. I waited several months only to be told the brush won't be shipped. Now I have a refill with no brush. How does Amazon manage this, obviously not well."
1,Refills are nice,I ordered this brush along with refills in September. I waited and waited for the item until Amazon finally shipped the refills. Then a few weeks later they notified me that they were cancelling the brush because it was not available. Now I am stuck with the refills but no brush. Someone was not using their head at Amazon!!!!
2,How does it work?,This product came with an installation cd that didn't work in my gift reciepent's computer and didn't fit in either of my laptops. The web page was a joke with absolutely no guidance either. I have since returned it and I am awaiting my credit because at least six people attempted and could not easily get this thing to successfully work.
2,This book is not for beginner,"I don't have a background of distributed computing before. I chose this book because it is available on library for borrowing. In general, big disappointed.The good of this book is the pseudo codes were re-written by the author to make it more readable, but that's all the good I can find for this book. I think this book is not for beginners because it is just a collection of papers. The author presents the materials almost the same way as the original papers, which make it very hard for beginners to understand . For every topic, I need to read several times to get the ideas. After reading 1/3 of this book, I switch to Lynch's book."
1,Defective,"This item was wired incorrectly and as such damaged the ps2 input to my system. I notified the seller to no avail. Amazon informed me I'd recieve a refund for the cost of the cable, thanks Amazon. But I still have a damaged motherboard that was just purchased a few months ago."
1,Don't try reversing - may damage your motherboard,"it would help it they tested these before they shipped - works for some and not others - like me. When I tried the reverse ""fix', computer made a troubling noise. Still would not work with mouse either way. Do not know if it damaged my motherboard or not.I got a USB Y soon after - works fine, so will stick with it Do not know if this damaged my PS 2 port however.Buy something else."
1,Only an extension...,doesn't allow most motherboards to work like this. Check your motherboard design to see if yours is one of about 1% that does.
3,Didn't work,"I purchased two, didn't work for either one - in box to be shipped back to Amazon for a refund. Too bad, I wanted it to work, look like ok quality.Was for my new MB with one combo PS/2 port. One of the ports on the splitter works with either mouse or keyboard but not the other - couldn't get both keyboard and mouse working at the same time. Had different keyboards and mice around my office but no combinations had worked including reversing the ports, purple to green and green to purple. Also, few combinations locked my Windows 8 computer - soft or a hard reset didn't work and couldn't get the computer running, needed to unplug the power cord. Back to USB for the mouse and PS/2 for the keyboard."
3,Effective and Simple,"These wine pourers have saved my wife and I many small drips and/or waste of perfectly good wine. When we first started getting into wine, we had a hard time pouring without getting those drips. These pourers really help out with that.There are 3 sizes of pourers in the set but, despite this there is not always one that perfectly fits some bottles, so a purchaser needs to be careful in those cases, to ensure the pourer doesn't pop out on you.The caps for the pourers are solid but the pourers themselves are made of a thinner, more flexible plastic.Despite these small drawbacks, these pourers work great and are a simple, effective and cheap way to avoid those annoying drops of wine that don't make it into the wine glass, where they should be."
4,Regretable,"Two days before my order was to arrive, it showed up on the tracking that the item had arrived damaged. When I called the phone number provided, I was told it would take at least two weeks to get a new one to me. Since I had ordered it as a Father's Day present, I had to cancel it and go buy something at a store.My money WAS refunded promptly, so I would consider purchasing from this seller again."
2,"Great Product, Cheap Case","I bought this kit because of the carrying case. I actually bought 3 of them because I was going to use them for Christmas gifts. Two out of the three arrrived with broken cases. The latches used to keep the cases closed are made of cheap plastic. I had to improvise...drill a hold through the case and use wing nuts to keep the case closed. I even did this with the non-broken case because the latches are so cheap, it is just a matter of time.The BBQ set is awesome. More than you need and very heavy duty. It is a shame that such a great set comes in such a cheap case. If you want a great set and are not afraid to conduct a little work on the case; this product is for you. I will say that the wing nuts make the appearance of the case look real cheesy and I hate having to unscrew and keep track of two wing nuts everytime I BBQ. Thumbs down because of the case."
2,"A nice idea, but so-so quality","In theory this is a nice set, and I like all of the different tools -- but I bought this as a gift, and I'm going to return it. It just looks too cheap. The wooden handles are chipped in some places, there's almost no finish on them, and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking. Perhaps if I was buying them for myself I wouldn't mind, but I'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift."
1,NOT MADE IN USA,"I was led to believe, from various sites on the web, that this product was made in the USA. Well, it's not. It is made in China."
4,The Last Aristocrat,"This is a good, dry biography of a complex man. Undoubtedly, this is a well researched book of a man, who despite being sickly, lived a long life and lived beyond most of his contemporaries. Even though he had many friends, Mr. Tennant was still a lonely man. He hobnobbed with the big names in the writing and artistic communities, and had royalty calling on him. Most famously, Mr. Tennant is thought to be the inspiration of Sebastian in ""Brideshead Revisited.""I take off a star because the book is such a dry read. It goes on from one biographical event to the next. It takes some effort to stick with it. However, the book does place us into Mr. Tennat's head, so we get to know the person with his strength and follies as well. The dynamics between friendships is well explained."
1,Modernism not Roman Catholicism,"If you want to learn what the Catholic Church teaches, you will have to look elsewhere. In this and other books by Fr. Michael Himes, the heresy of Modernism (which the Catholic Church has rebuked) is what you'll find. Fr. Himes passes his skewed views off as being those of the Church. If you are just interested in fluffy, feel good theology by all means read his writings. If you are serious about learning the true facts of the faith read books by Scott Hahn, Patrick Madrid, Fr. Michael Scanlan, Fulton Sheen, or anything by the Church Fathers."
5,Works great!,"Simple, and works well. Some people love laser pointers, personally I hate them - I find it very difficult to watch a presentation by someone using a laser pointer - the red dot is usually way too small and non-moving for me to find it. The human eye notices movement well, but not a red dot well. This physical pointer makes it trivial for everyone to see what you're pointing at."
5,The perfect springform pan.,"This springform pan is a good quality, multifunctional pan. I agree with other reviewers that the dome is fragile. So far, my dome is in good condition after nearly one year. I always hand wash the dome and pan. The handle is very tight and secure and the pan never leaks. I am an avid baker and primarily use this pan for cheesecakes which come out perfect every time!The nine inch Kaiser springform pan was first recommended to me over ten years ago by a Marshall Field's chef during a cheesecake demonstration. I have been using Kaiser pans ever since. I am so happy with the Kaiser quality that I have purchased several other products including loaf pans, cake pans and springform pans. I highly recommend this springform pan."
3,Not bad,Product was delivered on time. It works pretty good to reduce the tendinitic pain I was getting from playing raquette ball. It is a little hard to adjust but it seems to be doing the trick.
4,It works for the price,"After 3 weeks on crutches, THAT plus previous injuries resulted in a mean case of tendonitis. This product fit the bill for basic support and pain management. I would buy it again."
3,"LOVE this book except for ""Ladies are big"" page.","I am, overall, a huge fan of these books. We have quite a few of them. My son loves them. The colors & illustrations really capture his attention & he always smiles & squeaks when we flip each page. He loves that baby!The only issue I had with this book was the page that has an older, heavier woman on it & above it it says ""Ladies are big"" (it was comparing her to ladybugs). But still, uh, I thought that was a bit weird & inappropriate to have in a kids book. Especially when 2 pages later it says ""Grown-ups are big"" and ""babies are little."" It seems unnecessary & not something anyone would want a child to read & learn. Yes, ladies ARE bigger than ladybugs but seeing the ""ladies are big"" on the page I think could send the wrong message to kids. I have a great sense of humor but seeing this in a KIDS book...well, it's just not something I think should be there."
2,Not Worth The Money,"We bought this thinking that it would make food prep easier, especially french fries and salsa. It's just not doing the trick effectively. Even my husband has a hard time getting the slicer to push down over a potato. It takes a lot of muscle and time, which is what it was meant to save. Delicate foods like tomatoes just get smashed, while hard foods are very difficult to push through."
3,Room for improvement,"Interesting, first of all, how four unsigned reviews were posted the same day. Friends and family?I enjoyed many aspects of this book, though agree that the southernisms went way over the top in many cases. I'm not sure I would want to see the cliches and stereotypes from my own part of the world so exaggerated.What I found most disappointing, however, is the lack of emotional involvement / impact. This author should grab a few romances - Susan Elizabeth Phillips would be a good place to start - to see how to craft believable personal relationships."
4,Good bargain and met my needs,Reminded me of my small town and how the little stores continually are being trumped by the giant chain store. Characters pull you in to root for the dollar store/owner to overcome the storm. This was a trial with this author and series. Amazon picked it just right when matching up similar authors(Fannie Flagg).Can't wait to explore more of Gillespie's books.
3,Not the Strongest Case,"Yes, I knew they were the thin jewel case when I ordered them, but I did not expect them to be all that much cheaper in quality, but they are. They are very fragile, don't expect the same quality as the standard one's, that's not the case. They are thinner, cheaper, and more fragile than the standard jewel case. And expect to find a few broken one's upon receiving them."
1,worst product ever,No support No warranty No one to talk to the tv it's expensive just paying for the shipping!!!!after 2 and a half year it's scrap need it parts and no one will repair it cause the part for the TV it's no longer availabledo not and I MEAN DO NOT BUY ANYTHING MADE BY AKAI
5,"If you love the Great Lakes, buy this album!","Anyone who is a fan of Pat Daily knows that his party songs are some of the wildest and funniest around. But anyone who follows Pat's work seriously knows that his first love is the Great Lakes. For those of us who have spent time in small boats and big seas on those lakes there is no one who has better captured the love that we all share for the beauty and danger of the sweet water. On this album you will hear it all. Pat begins with the best cover I've ever heard of the late Stan Roger's ""White Squall"". After that, it is pure Pat. Every song is great!I have every album that Pat has made, including a number that are not available on Amazon, but can be found on his web site. In addition, I have heard Pat in concert almost fifty times since the early eighties. I have never been disappointed with a concert, nor heard an album from him that I didn't like. But of all his work,""Freshwater"" is still my favorite. I play it almost every time I'm on my boat."
2,Gradual tan washes off in shower,"This seemed like a great solution to getting a tan during the winter time. I don't want to go to tanning salons so I thought I would try a tanning lotion. I got a bit of a tan going but I noticed that it washes off. If you use a washcloth or something to scrub with, you may just wash off the tan like I did. I rate this product with 2 stars because it doesn't work for me."
2,"Not as good as paper, but works.","We bought this to try to be more environment friendly, since we brew coffee several times a day, and it bothered us to see the amount of paper we wasted on the coffee machine filters. Well, it works, but the coffee doesn't taste as rich as it does when compared to paper filters (my explanation is that the plastic one has larger holes, therefore the hot water passes quicker), and it leaves a little bit of very fine powder in the bottom of the jar."
2,Be aware product description inaccurate,Be aware the product description and photo indicate the brush has brass bristles. The product I received had steel bristles.
3,So -So,The construction is solid enough but the brush is absolutely flat. If it had an angle to the head / handle it would greatly increase it's usefulness.

2,Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles,"Even though this is a great workout. I'm disappointed that it's just like Super Challenge. Same music and routine, just different people. When I watched the sample trailer it shows Leslie by herself and doing other exercise routine such as the squat with the stretchy. I was really looking forward to the workout.That's the reason for the 2 star score. I feel dupped into buying a workout dvd, opening the package and once it's opened you can't return it. Oh well, I've decided to give it away."
5,Leslie is the best,I walked away 35 pounds with Leslie and was in the best shape of my life...but I stopped and need to do it again.
4,Good Product,"This is a great workout that you can do in the privacy of your own home, or together with friends. Leslie is pretty down to earth and savy when it comes to walking workouts."
2,"Beware of the ""one click"" purchase feature - I received duplicate DVD's and was charged for two instead of the one.","Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big MilesIt was okay but seemed to duplicate previous exercise videos by Leslie Sansone. The 4th mile was a little difficult for older adults, unless you are in perfect condition and can keep up the pace for a long period of time."
5,"Wonderful Talent, Beautiful Music","I was very impressed with the first DVD / CD from the 5 Browns, and and at least as impressed with this latest one too! Just wonderful talented people, producing dynamic, exciting and moving music. Great stuff."
5,"Unbelievable talent, unbelievalbe age","This CD was a great purchase. The Browns have phenomenal technical virtuosity, which is not compromised by their choice of extremely difficult pieces. The numbers that have all of them playing together are specifically impressive, as I could not discern they were separate players. They play together so seamlessly, it is hard to believe they are all so young. However, I guess you would expect that from the first family ever to have all 5 children get into Julliard and receive scholarships no less. Their talent will amaze you."
4,"A solid introduction to Podcasting, told by someone with a lot of in-the-field experience!","As someone who is only just dipping my digital voicebox into the podcasting ocean, this DIY Guide was extremely useful. It guides you through the basics of setting up on the computer you've probably already got with a cheapo microphone and freeware audio editing with Audacity. It also shows how a few more steps can lead to a far more professional sound with relatively minimal effort and expense.I also like the frequent ""notes"" which highlight important terms and ideas, many of which I know, but some of which were new. Cochrane's explanations are always easy to understand.The only downside is that this book was released before iTunes support for Podcasting became the pod-word of the month. While the iTunes influence might be slightly over-hyped, it is changing the podosphere. Perhaps a second edition of the DIY Guide will come out early next year and give us another healthy survey of all things poddy."
5,This book should not be out of print,"In Silent Retreats, Philip Deaver shows us what so few writers can: the sometimes delicate, sometimes harrowing, shifting of real emotion beneath the everyday. With deft turns of phrase and a sharp eye for telling detail, Deaver's haunted runners, love-struck teens, and overstressed businessmen seeking serenity reflect to us things about ourselves we have always known, but never stated. In the early-60s, small Illinois town setting of ""Arcola Girls"", an O Henry Award winning story, Deaver depicts with tenderness teenage love, longing, and loss. Why this book is out of print is beyond me."
1,Beware -- these are not as advertised!,"The description above claims these pans are ""Commercial-weight stainless steel"". Not true!!! The Kaiser web site claims hese are steel pans with a non-stick coating. These pans will rust if deeply scratched! If youare looking for stainless steel jelly roll pans then these are NOT whatyou want!"
5,Amazing knowledge given here for the first time,hi allthis book opend me to the fact that there are aliens in this univerce and they r all the time with us .the book gives a lot of knowledge about aliens that live in other dimentions then ars and for that we cant see them but with r sycic eye.adrian-a good friend of mine-heals people with aliens -and the help u can get is amazing.in the book there is alot of knowledge-given by the aliance about them selvs and about there connections with the human race.there r alot of amazing phiscical theories given about going to other dimentions and passing the speed of light.the book is well writen and i loved reaing it and i understud alot about humanity and aliance from it.this book will open anw path for alot of people who want to understand the purpos of life and r connection with aliance.thanks for all u here that will open the door for a better place to live ingood bless us all(sorry about the speling mistakes im a bit dislectic)gil elichay domanyisrael
2,Not recommended,"Tried to use this to connect a PC's serial port to a RS-485 device. Sometimes this device would allow communication one way, and sometimes it would allow communication the other way, but we could not get it working reliably after about a week of fiddling with it.In contrast, one of the other adapters that we tested (which cost $99) worked very reliably without any trouble (so it wasn't a problem with the cabling, the PC, or the RS485 device). Overall I would not recommend this product as it was very unreliable for us."
4,Great buy,"I only put four stars because this pan is not as sturdy as the one I paid $40.00 for, but it is a great buy for $10.00!"
2,Defective,"I just bought this pan and it was defective. The edges won't close properly because when I poured the batter in, liquid spilled out. When I looked closely at it, a part of the edge is dented, leaving an open space for liquid to leak out."
3,Makes you very very very very hot!!!,Awesome for the winter. But terrible in the summer. Great pants for construction pants. Heavy pants too.
1,Where is my stuff,"I purchased this book on 12 March, promised it was shipped on the 13th or 14th. When I inquireed two weeks later I was told it was shipped the 19th. Anyway it is now the 4th of April and I still don't have it. I will be filing a claim. Beware."
4,Good silicone ladle,"I purchased this because it is silicone. It is very sturdy and heavy. The bowl is good size, a smaller angled size would be nice too. I find the handle a bit awkward. It is a bit too thick for smaller hands."
1,"Liberal with a capital ""L""","I understand that the death penalty is a divisive issue, but ultimately, pro or con, no one wants an innocent person put to death. In this book, Mr. Patterson seemed to me to equate the support of the death penalty to a support of wrongful death. I felt the story was woven in such a way as to SCREAM that there is no true justice in our legal system, and as such, we simply cannot allow the death penalty to stand. I was interested in reading a carefully woven tale, but instead got caught up in an op-ed piece. Personally, I prefer not to spend my money purchasing what I believe to be fiction, only to find out it is a cleverly wrapped soapbox."
2,Couldn't wait to put it down,"Wow - normally I enjoy legal thriller type novels, however, this one was so long winded and overly tedious that I couldn't wait for it to end so I could unceremoniously toss it into the recycle bin. If you like endless legal mumbo-jumbo presented from the point of view of an obvious liberal, then maybe you'll be able to tolerate it. However, as a ""novel"" I wish it offered more entertainment and less of the authors apparent disdain for capital punishment. Go figure, the story takes place in the SF Bay area.In conclusion, my advice would be to find something else."
1,Terrible book,"I picked up the audio book thinking at first I had picked up James Patterson, I saw that it wasnt, but I thought it might be good anyway. I was so wrong. It was too long, too much legal jargon you couldnt understand unless you were a lawyer or a judge. Dont want to give away the ending but dont read this book, terrible ending, not expected at all. I will never read another of his books again. I will make sure its JAMES PATTERSON next time."
1,RACIST,"This book was full of the worst African American racial stereotypes you can imagine. This was my first Patterson book, and it will be my last! As an African American woman, I was offened at every turn of the page. It's a scary notion that a book such as this is a best seller. Far too many people have read this disgusting book."
5,good reminder,"This book is just a good reminder that time goes by fast, and instead of getting caught up in the business, take the time to watch your child grow and appreciate the milestones before they are gone."
5,Cry of the Hawk,"I have read Terry C. Jonhston,s books for years and I think the three Plainsmen books were his best, We lost a great Author when we lost him."
5,Amazing,"I don't know that I've heard a greater collection of jazz from this period. Whoever created "" Turkish Mambo"" alone deserves to be in some kind of musical hall of fame. If Beethoven was around at the time he may well have written something like this. And the piano playing is jazz of the highest order. Tristano was mainly a music teacher who neither recorded nor appeared in public all that often, but by existing evidence, it appears to have been quite an event when he did. The trio and quartet sides are very good and impressively improvised jazz. These sides, along with his legendary sextet recordings on Capitol are creations by a man ahead of his time."
4,saving money while staying warm,I drive a tractor-trailer and with the new idling laws have to shut the engine down at customers locations.I have used this blanket several times and have found it warms up in minutes and keeps me warm.The 5 amp draw is very low.I wish the blanket was a bit longer and wider.The thermosat is non adjustable.... I ordered a 2nd blanket for another driver....
1,But NOT for Emergency Use,"Great for road trips, I'm sure -- I like my car's heated seats.But NOT for Emergency use!I see that some advocate this electric blanket for use in an emergency . . . you're stuck and have run out of gas so plug in this blanket to keep warm.Not a good idea -- you'll drain the battery and then, if you are able to get some fuel you will not be able to start the vehicle."
1,Junk,I plugged in this blanket and after waiting three hours I tested the temperature with an infrared thermometer. It reached a whopping three degrees warmer than the sofa it was draped over. Either this one is defective or just a piece of junk. I am suspecting the later. I think the good reviews on here are from road pro.
5,Review on Heated Trave Blanket,"It was received when they said it would arrive and I so love this blanket, heats up immediately and gets nice and cozy for traveling."
4,12-volt Heated Electric Car Blanket,"I bought this for my wife because on long car trips she would crank the heat in the car and still freeze while I would burn up, sweat, and get sleepy. We have only taken about a 45 minute ride since we have had the blanket but about 15 minutes into the trip, on a cool rainy night, the heat went off and stayed off. This was well worth the purchase."
3,Great until it quit,"We bought this blanket August 2010 to create a warm spot in the car for the dog on cold days. It worked wonderfully, not too hot, warmed quickly enough, big enough to keep me warm when I sat in the car waiting. We were VERY happy with it. We brought it again this season and it is no longer working. I was going to buy it again, but I think I will try another brand."
4,A truly English book,"Curse this book! It bought home life to a virtual standstill as first myself and then my fiance found it un-put-downable :-)It's about many things: The sadness of war, the stubborness and idiocy of bureaucracy, a new broom sweeping clean, the quest for a better method.The anecdotes about the famous book store at 84 Charing Cross road, and it't clients, are also enjoyable.The poetry is, by turns, bawdily amusing and moving.But perhaps most of all this book is a portratit of dear old English eccentricity. What other nation could produce a master cryptographer whose idea of morning exercise is traversing a sequence of rings above an indoor swimming pool - whilst wearing a suit and bowler hat?"
2,"Naughty, brilliant boy saves the world","OK, I had my kids read this--Man what a kick in the pants! It does drag in places--for instance when Leo Marks wanders too long in,""Oh what a bad boy I am-Land"" but he redeems himself with sheer bravado. I am an unabashed and shameless fan. In our finely tuned, high tech, silicon injected, code spewing world--it's lovely to read about the Man who created the CODE, back in the day:)"
2,See below,"Fascinating topic, but prose too often indecipherable due to author's heavy-handed attempts at wit"
5,It is more than a music experience,Webb and Campbell were meant to be together. His voice and Webbs lyrics were a match made in music heaven. I had the wonderful experience to see them both together in Indianapolis about 3 years ago. Poor Glen tried to keep up with his family band as he played all those songs from his career and Webb was there giving us a sample of all the wonderful songs he had written. So inspirational...so unforgetable...just like this album. Ths album is gold and can't be played enough.
3,Max Payne : The Movie -_-~,"The one reason why I remember this movie is that is reminds me a lot of the character in the video game Max Payne and could pass off easily as a movie version of a Max Payne prequel. I won't got into detail with the movie itself as the other review gave quite accurate detail on the material (admittedly I can barely remember this movie to say much,anyway)."
2,Accurate but a display issue.,"Very accurate thermometer. However I do not think it has an automatic cut off regarding power. Mine is now useless as far as display, I think the battery has gone dead. If a calculator has an automatic turn off mechanism, why not this?"
5,Awesome cd!,Ok so this CD has alot of awesome guitar and drums and singing and screaming! So if you like awesome music get this cd! but if you dont like awesome music then do not get this cd!
3,"Fun, but slightly hard to keep up","I am a huge fan of Jeanette Jenkins DVD's, so I bought this excited to change it up a little with the dance and kickboxing combined. Turns out I'm not that quick to pick up the moves on the combinations. I did, however get my heart rate up and felt that I had been worked out at the end. Jeanette is delightful and fun as always."
5,Fun!,"I love this kickboxing video. She incorporates fun dance moves into her kickboxing routine, and even has you do jump kicks (but of course you don't have to if you're not ready to do that yet), which I find tons of fun. This video hasn't gotten old for me yet. I've used it lots of times now. I would recommend it highly.Oh, and one more thing. It has gotten a little easy but I just make sure I put more effort into it. Also, I do this when I want a little easier of a workout cause I'm tired or sore. It's still nice to have around even once you get more fit."
1,Disappointing,"Yes it was both annoying and awkward for the same reasons others noted, b/w the 'party' and the 'make it your own's and 'touch yourselves'...I gather this is geared to a much younger audience."
3,Fun but not so intense,"I'm an intermediate-level kickboxing junkie coming out of a 2-month fitness hiatus. This DVD was fun and really helped me get my mojo back. But it's not challenging enough to keep me sweating in the long term.I also have to agree with some of the other reviews. For me,the combination of kickboxing and dance was awkward. I spent more time perfecting sashays than working up a good sweat, and the kickboxing elements were pretty sparse.Overall, if you're a beginner looking for a fun dance DVD, this one will do (and introduce you to some light kickboxing moves in the process). But if your less interested in choreography than kickboxing, stick with Billy Blanks."
4,Inquiry Based Science Activities,I have used many of the activities in the book and I've enjoyed all of them. I especially like the safey quiz at the begining of the book. It has provided my students with a good understanding of the importance of safety in the lab.I recommend this book for a general physical science class.
3,Good for a song or two,"These are original recordings (not redone) that faithfully reproduce sounds of the group. They were big in the late 50's and if you didn't grow up or live in that era, this probably wouldn't be for you. I especially like ""Young Blood,"" a song you never hear on the radio these days (or ever?). "" Shopping for Clothes"" is another you never hear that I liked. I'd preview it before you order it, but I thought it was worth the coins."
5,Includes all the hits and then some.,"Purchased this as a surprise gift for my husband's birthday. It included all his favorites. If you like the Coasters, you'll love this one."
3,Hold it a moment,There is a two-disc set out there with all their hits and I mean ALL of them. Invest in that one if you want the whole magilla.
4,Good Travel Alarm Clock Too....,"I've had this for years and like it very much (perfect tri-tips!). Multi use! When a friend and I went camping one time, we didn't have a travel alarm clock and brought this along so we could wake up to see the sunrise over Bryce Canyon. After 7 hours of timing, we woke up muttering ""turkey's done..."""
4,Great Tool!,"This is the greatest. I've only used it once so far, but it worked fantastic. I like that you can insert it into the meat and close the oven and see what the temperature inside of the meat is without opening the oven. Cool product! It's a great timer besides the thermometer."
3,Good computer - but ..... the probe,I used this product a lot in the kitchen with great success.My probe died on me 2 weeks ago. The pesky problem is that there are no support from robinsonknife company and you can not buy a new probe. My search is on to find a more durable themometer
1,My experience ...,"Last October I bought this unit. I used the probe once for my 14lb turkey last year and if worked great. I paid $26 for the whole unit w/ probe.This year, I inserted the probe and the temp immediately shot up to 199F, over the target 161F temperature. I tried reinserting the probe into the breast several times, thinking that I didn't put the probe in properly. But to no avail.The probe doesn't wok properly. Do not pay the $99 for this. Remember, I paid $26 for the whole unit which included 4.99 for shipping. Either this is mispriced or amazon is ripping you off."
5,"Great product, but do your research and save $80","I've had this Pyrex thermometer for about 5 years from a wedding gift. Its great and convenient. I used it frequently until recently when the probe was accidently broken. That being said, I was taken back that this item was priced at $100... so decided to find out what was out there. What I found was the EXACT thermometer, under Oneida brand for $20 at Bed Bath and Beyond. The Oneida probe fit and worked with my Pyrex thermometer.... it looks the same, the buttons are the same, the sounds are the same, the features are the same, the instructions were the same (word for word)...... no difference except for the brand its being sold under. Oneida offers a lifetime warranty (JOY!). So.... I highly recommend you do your research... particularly compare the Pyrex with the Oneida at BBB and see what you come up with."
5,The best translation of Dante's Commedia,"This translation is faithful and modern at the same time. I know Italian and have read the italian poem, but I am also interested in translation, and have found that Musa's work is far superior to others. He explains his criteria in the translator's note: use of modern words, exclusion of rhyme and fidelity to the semantic content. Solutions like the verse: ""And, everywhere I looked, the beast was there"" (Inf. I, 34) which translates ""e non mi si partia dinanzi al volto"" fascinate me. This is a search for clarity and fidelity at the same time, dealing with a language that does not simplify things for a translator.Very recommendable."
4,Good variety and not too bad for immitations.,"Definitely listen to the samples. It will give you an idea of what's on the cds. If you are very familiar with the original artists then you will definitely notice that these songs are not performed by them. Otherwise, if you simply like the music and don't really care who's singing, this collection has a good variety of 'dance club' music."
2,"New Console, New Game?","I got this game on import from Japan aout a week ago to play on my GBA and I gotta say, it .... It's a direct [copy] of Mario Bros and Super Mario and its pointless getting it unless you never payed the original. ...One for the novices this One"
5,VERY GOOD,"this title for GBA is awsome! and yes, I HAVE PLAYED IT!! u can play it at ... and no it is not a demo! it is the real game!!"
5,Who cares if it wasn't originally a Mario game?,"A lot of people's only beef with SMB2 (US version) was that it wasn't originally a Mario game. [this is an all too familiar story for some] Nintendo thought Americans would get too frustrated with the original, and it's understandable if some takes this as an insult towards American gaming skills; but who cares. I just take it as ignorance on their part; it also doesn't change the fact that Doki Doki Panic was fun and brought something new to the Mario franchise. If it wasn't for ignorance on their part, most American Mario fans wouldn't have gotten to experience this fun game.To those who shun this game because it wasn't originally a Mario game: let go of your small hang-up and buy it, because Doki Doki Panic or Mario, this game simply kicks ass. It's the best in the franchise and it's time for a sequel."
5,Mario returns for gameboy advance,"This game is great! You can get a GIANT eggplant, or turnip and then you get three hearts. You can be Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Peach. This game is sooo much fun...you have to get one. Thanks to Game Boy and Amazon because i got it a really good price and for creating it. It was a really smart idea. I hope that they will come out wiht other Mario gameboy advance games cause they are so much fun to play. This game is worth a lot of money because i have a blast playing it."
2,This game stinks.,I do not like this game because there is only 0 ways to win. I also do not like it because the instructions did not help one bit. I think this game is the worst Mario game to be created. I think the game isn't supposed to exist. My brother thinks it is a good game until world 1-3 because the bombs keep blowing him up.
3,Super Mario Advanced,"This game has not so great graphics, but its mario and you cant go wrong with this plumber. the game is actually 2 well... good games on it. the real classic on it (Mario Bros. 2) is what practically ruins the game. Its very boring and unmeaningfull. But the real super mario advanced is a blast!! although You can pick from only 4 different characters to play with, this still is a great game. Toad who is fast and strong but has a problem jumping. Then of course theres Mario who is so-so good. Then my personal favorite, Luigi who jumps amazingly but is kind of weak and is not to fast. Then theres Peach whos jump is horid and is the weakest and x-tra sllllloooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwww.Sorry Peach fans. The only reason i gave this game 3 stars is because super mario bros. 2 and the lack of characters."
3,AVERAGE GAME,ok first of all this doesn't have enough new feautres 2 keep it intresting even tho it has 2 games in 1 i would rather have seen new levels and better items and more than just 2 options of multi-player i think if they put enough time in it they could have probably made this game 4 the GBC(Game Boy Color) well atleast Super Mario Bros.2 i think ill just wait 4 Super Mario Bros. 3 4 GBA(Game Boy Advance)
3,"Quite a disappointment for being ""Advance""","When I heard about the upcoming release of the GameBoy Advance, I pre-ordered it with this game. I had heard that it included some parts of old games, but didn't realize it was entirely made up of old games I've already played plenty of times. What gives, Nintendo? I'm quite disappointed with this game, as it's nothing new at all. If you are a fan of the classics and can't get enough of them, then you'll enjoy this game. But if you want a new Mario game, you might want to pass on this game and wait for the next one."
5,Great Game!,"Simply put, its a great game. Very funny and engaging. If you enjoy the Mario Games in general this will be a great addition! I really can't think of anything I din't like about the game, and I am fairly critical person. One of the better games I have ever played."
2,Not so great,This game is not so great. When I first got a gba i was looking for a good game to get. I read the reviews for this game and it seemed pritty good. When i played it it was OK.(nothing great) In the later levils it gets really hard. The graphics are not that great. I dont recomend this to some one that just wants to have fun game playing. ITS HARD! Dont buy this game if you want something easy. TRUST ME!
2,Disapointing,I thought this game was going to be a killer app for the GBA. But it turned out this game was just a watered down port with a really dumb multi-play. I think you should get Chu Chu Rocket! or Mario Kart. Even on the Nintendo this game was not really that good.
3,It okay,"I only played it in stores. I wouldnt get it but im not a ""Mario Freak."" It was okay they actully talk, but not a lot. Like when you die Toad goes AHO! IT is okay same graphics as SNES. Two modes. Orginal and Super Mario. Super Mario is the mario kids know and love, and the original is a bunch of turtles falling from the sky and you have to knock em' over or something. It a good game. It isnt better than THPS2 but it will last you longer."
4,Hey Mario Fans!,Like Mario?Like Luigi?Well Luigi is in this game too.Like a Princess?Like a mushroom girl?Well they are the chararcters of this game!This is a brand new world for Mario!Melissa
5,this is a really good game,This is a really cool game for gba. the coulers are really good. The picture is good. I played this a eb and i got it from japan because my aunt went there. so far this game is one of the best
3,Eh. An original Mario for the GBA would be much better.,"Nintendo is taking all their Mario games from the Nintendo, tweaking them ever so little, and then re-packaging them as new, original games. I loved the Mario games when I was a kid (still do!), but all these games are much more difficult on the GBA then the Nintendo. I've beat all the original Mario games, but it was difficult for me to do with the GBA. I wouldn't recommend this game for children, as they may find it too difficult to control."
3,Warps and discolors immediately,"We were looking for a replacement for our Ekco baking sheets, and tried these on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated (March/April, 1998), especially since the review said that the Kaisers didn't warp. The Ekcos warp quite badly, and this was very annoying. We have been disappointed. These sheets discolored immediately, leaving a harsh anodized blue color, as well as imprints from the food cooked on them, which are very hard or impossible to remove. And, most importantly, they DID warp, and badly. We'll keep them; they are just as serviceable as the Ekcos, but certainly not an improvement at all. These are larger, but our stove can only take one sheet at a time, as opposed to two of the smaller Ekcos. This is inefficient for large batches. We are starting to wonder if any tinned steel baking sheet doesn't warp, and we now know that these certainly do. They ARE inexpensive, however, and this may be their best selling point."
5,Religious Music,"I love this CD. Especially the 10,000 Angels song. I had heard that in church years ago and it puts me in a holy place every time I heard it. This group sings that song really excellent."
4,Cool and interesting,"This book deals with something I've wondered about for a long time: the seemingly religious aspects of (pop) cultural ideas, images, totems, rituals, etc., and in particular, the role of human imagination, and in many cases, deliberate fraud, in creating a backdrop of meaning for life.While the book is a pleasurable read, it does maintain a certain level of erudition, stylistically. It also manages to remain focused and serious while allowing in just the right amount of good humour and whimsy.I especially liked the discussions on baseball and Jim Jones; after reading this, I'll be ordering Chidester's book on the Jonestown suicide.Thumbs up."
5,Touching and deep,"This film was excellent. The director allows the viewer to become comfortable with the characters, and then adds abstract information to complicate the plot. The viewer feels uncertain and confused at some points in the film, but that is the brilliance of this piece of work. This film keeps the viewer stimulated by using visual effects. Also there is a strong sense of motion. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what is suppose to be a dream, and what is actually reality. The film is basically centered around a brother and sister relationship with a few added complications. This relationship is very odd, but realistic and touching. The ending is very vague, but that is reality. The viewer is left with a deep feeling of some kind, it is very difficult to explain. This film is a pure representation of society, economy, and morality. The director puts the viewer face to face with the hardships of everyday. life."
5,perfection,This music is great for anyone who loves something different. It draws you in and takes you to another place. I highly recommend it!
1,I agree with shen,"I bought this three cd set for 8.99 at virgin for a promotion and I still fee ripped off. If you want good music like cd1, at the bar, get the disco kandi and disco heaven cds put our by hed kandi. they are vastly superior.If you want music like cd2, at the club, get the global underground series. They are good for that.and if you want chill out like in cd3, then get the hed kandi served chilled or the cafe del mar series or the back to mine series.This has a lot of repeats of what is on the other series and the versions of the songs are not as good. It sounds brassy and overall, sounds cheaper. Big thumbs down."
2,Spin Doctors One And Only Pitiful Effort,"These guys were just a flash come & go artists brought out some cool tunes with a funky meleody and after it was over the group dissaperad. `TWO PRINCES` & `POCKET FULL OF KRYPTONITE`are good songs Otherwise the album was pititful this group were not much of anything. The band tries to have a blues based rocking kind of music almost similar to Steve Miller, It never did work."
4,"Not a Brilliant album,but a fun one","Most of the songs on this tape brings back great memories of the early 90's.I love the hits,""Little Miss can't be wrong,""and my favorite ,""Two Princes.""Chris Barron doesn't have a great voice,but he does a wonderfull job on this album.""Jimmy Olsen's blues,"" the first cut, is a great lead in,along with ""What time is it?""The only bad number is the last one,""Shinbone Alley/Hard to exist."" These two songs seem to go on forever,and you can't wait for them to end.I still play""Pocket full of Kryptonite""every once in awhile.Its ashame the Spin Doctors have disapeared from the airwaves after this mega hit debut."
2,Rusty after first wash,"I have used and washed (in the dishwasher) this pan once and it is already rusty where the buckle attaches to the pan, on the buckle itself, inside the lip, and inside the pan along the join. The instructions say the pan is dishwasher safe but it evidently is not."
1,Pyrex All-Purpose Spatula,"A very nice heat-resistant spatula, with one big exception: the edge is chipping [we probably ate these little chips w/o noticing...]. Always washed by hand, never left in a hot pot, i.e. never abused. I am glad that the head is translucent: I can see any grime that found its way inside the head: - just pull apart, use a tiny brush + clean the inside of the head.Without the chipping problem this spatula would deserve 5 stars."
5,Charger,The charger was exactly what I had needed. Plugged it in to my razor e300 and it worked as it should have.
1,The Battery.,"After sometime Ive check my orders that i placed, and to my surprise this product wasn't at all what i expected, the picture of this battery shows a battery box with cords on both ends of it. The one I received was completely different from the one i was expecting. The charger i received does not fully charge my scooter. Maybe i should have known this sooner but its been months since i bought this. Cant expect products on Amazon to be what they appear to be when i buy them."
4,battery charger,I was satisified with this charger. I purchased it for alot cheaper than I would of from the Company. This was the first time I used Amazon and will return again.
3,Good For Playing Dress Up or a Costume.,"I currently bought this for my husbands halloween costume since he wanted to be a viking. The helmet is pure plastic & is sharp around the edges so it will leave a mark on your forehead. Also the helmet was a small standard size. If your a big guy, this helmet will not fit you. The helmets size is great for kids, females, or standard/average males. This viking helmet was good for halloween but nothing more. If you plan on wearing it for a long period of time durring the day, put something on your forehead so the plastic wont stab you in the head & cut your skin."
5,great viking helmet!,"This is sturdy, well made, and should fit even larger heads. Totally fun party item."
5,Best pepper mill I ever Owned,"After over 50years of marriage and several dufferent pepper mills--all of which never performed the way I hoped--I sam a review inCooks Illustrated magazine, in which they highly recommended this product. Never having had a ""bum steer"" from that source, I ordered the William Bounds pepper mill. I outperforms everything else I ever tried. It is easy to fill, super easy to operate with my arthriticy hands,and produces a variety of grinds at the flip of a dial. An outstanding product."
2,Not enough pepper comes out,"The BIG problem with this thing is that you will break your wrist trying to get enough pepper to come out. I think America's test kitchen did a test on ""pepper output"" for different grinders. Unfortunately, I already bought this before I saw the reveiw. Needless to say, this wasn't the winner."
3,Don't drop it!,"The multiple timers are great, which is why I got it. But after a few drops on the floor from the countertop, it started to get squirrly: the thumb slider on the side that changes modes became unreliable (switching to clock mode in the middle of setting a time, for example), and one of the plastic tines in the battery cover broke off, leading to unrealiable contact with battery and constant resetting of clock. In short, not industrial strength."
2,How much weight should be put into reviews???????????,"anyway.. I bought this timer based on the reviews. People said it was worth the money and plenty loud. To me if something breaks in 4 months its worth 4 dollars, not 20! No, it is not loud at all. Not if you have other things going on in the house. It may suffice if ou are in total silence sitting somewhere close by waiting for a timer to go off! Based on my experience I say its a low quality item, so possible they are coming out of the factory with varying performance. And now it makes no sound at all because its dead already."
3,Not as good as their first CD,"After thoroughly enjoying ""Always Never Enough"" CD, i was disappointed in this CD (""House Down the Block""). To me none of the songs have the soul and drive of their debut album. Amanda seems a little too comfortable in her voice role."
3,Just a descent product for the price,"The shirt quality isn't the highest that it could be, but what do you expect for a jersey style tee for the price? Would still recommend it for die hard fans, or for use for softball batting practice!"
2,I'm an idiot,"I was initially shopping for some DVD cases and I saw this ... from the main image shown it looked like a multi pack of DVD-RW in DVD cases, almost killing two birds with one stone there - I get the cases and have some handy DVD-RW's at a bargain price. I was clearly too hasty and don't realise why I wasn't more cautious. The image is totally misleading, unlike the product title ""DVD-RW, 4X, with Jewel Case"", which is what you get. One of them of brand 'Imitation' (see my customer image). So with the shipping cost added on I was fleeced. $7.85 for one DVD-RW. Don't think there's any sense in returning it."
2,Agree,"I think Brian wrote a pretty much dead on review and I just wanted to add a ""me too"".I think these pieces look really cute but they are not terribly functional."
3,It 's a goog summary,"I listen to John MacArthur on the radio all the time. His sermons are very long but the commentaries in this book are rather short. This book is helpful if you have already studied the passages in length and want a guide to sum up all the points. If not, you may find it too concise. I like MacArthur's teachings and I borrow his ideas when I teach Sunday school. This commentary helps me organize my teaching plans after I have gathered material from different sources. I will recommend this book only as a secondary reference."
5,Grace To You always hits the target,"reads well, helps with minor ~ non-difficult passages of the bible. If you want a more definative commentary you will have to order from John's book by book commentary's. I would recommend."
5,The MacArthur Bible Commentary,Anyone who is really serious about effectively gaining knowledge and understanding of God's Word should use this bible commentary as their right hand reference tool.
2,Dog gone boring,The book is too disjointed and much of it reads like poetry this isn't what I expected.
3,Decent Pan,"You get what you pay for here. This pan is not the heaviest gauge that Kaiser produces and I was disappointed to discover that. But I guess I should have known better with the price. Although the product literature states that this pan is ""leak proof"" it indeed leaks. But, it doesn't leak much and I can live with it for the price. The pan is sturdy and the locking mechanism works well. Non-stick finish needs to be treated with common sense - like all non-stick finishes you must use utensils that are non-metal. Those who complain that the surface gets scratched with a knife should have known better. Bottom line is that it's s decent pan for the price."
5,Elmo Cake A Crowd Pleaser,"My two-year old grandnephew is into Elmo right now, so I purchased this cake pan to make his birthday cake. This was one of the easier specialty character cakes that I've done over the years and he recognized him right away and loved the cake. Because the whole cake was just the face as opposed to several that are of the entire body, it was much easier to decorate and the indentations were much more distinct. Hopefully, he'll still be into Elmo for a little while longer. I was a little worried that he might be upset about cutting into Elmo's face. However, being all boy, he giggled and laughed and wanted the nose!"
1,"This man calls his creator sadistic and Genocidal. I wonder where he get his information from? Could it be his god ""Satan""?",This author has absolutely no facts to support his claim. Show me one piece of proof he has. I'll bet when he's burning in hell he'll believe God then.
3,It does wrap...,"I have used this for about 20 times and then it starts to wrap. Well, the X pattern in the bottom sheet does prevent the wrapping to get too severe. So in some sense Kaiser design does work. But I will be more impressed if it doesn't wrap in the first place.Overall this seems to be an OK cookie sheet and it's rare to find anything sticking on it, with the exception of chocolate chips. At this price, however, you can also consider buying two inexpensive cookie sheets and save some time in baking (since you should cool off a cookie sheet before you put dough on it again)."
4,Great baking sheet...however it warp up a little when extreme heat applied?!!!,Great baking sheet solution. I love it. It does warp up slightly after baking cookies. Later it cools back to original shape. I am assuming this occurs because there are two pieces of metal on top and bottom. So there is air inside in between the top and bottom piece whic could cause this. Of course I am no physics expert. So no 5 stars. However if all baking sheets warp than this is a 5 star rating...
1,Disappointing.,"The pan, guaranteed never to warp, warped the second time we used it in the oven. The pan is also supposed to be dishwasher safe, but a significant amount of water made its way into the pan after one wash.To the pan's credit, the cookies slid right off.I'd recommend Farberware's insulated sheets over anything from Kaiser."
5,Cafe de Paris,"The songs on this CD are just wonderful. I have enjoyed every song they played on it, it is a treat to listen to it. Wonderful music, very enjoyable."
2,Bad quality,I bought some of pamper brand for baby wipe. but this one is the worse i use. coz the quality of the wipe is no good and bad quality. I prefer the sensitive one or others. i won't use this one again. thanks.
2,It's Okay,"This set looks really nice in package. The Pepper mill is a little difficult to get the pepper to grind to a nice consistancy. Had BIG hunks of peppercorns that comes out. Overall, not happy with this purchase. Only reason I give it 2 stars is the looks of the product is nice!"
5,Great Collection of Songs,"What a great collection of songs from 60s! I was looking for one song in particular, ""Sukiyaki Song"" which became a huge hit in Japan when was living there and also accompanied this singer in Tokyo. So I wanted to get a copy and finding this one with the singer. Other songs are great also."
3,Top Pops,This item has only about 3 or 4 really great songs on it.But if you want hard to find songs you take the bad with the good.
2,Thrown together...,"My husband has been a huge fan of theirs for years. This band changed his band and his life, but per his opinion, this record seems thrown together. Seems made while they were in different rooms or something..."
2,Bummer.,"I'm not a fan of the vocals/vocal effects at all. I've been trying to get into it and I can't. The music is rad and there are a couple songs I like, but all in all, I'm not digging the album as a whole. I bought this new and when I returned to the store the next day I saw 3 copies in the used section. I wouldn't sell it, but I don't think it'll be making my rotation as much as their older stuff."
3,"Good, but.....","The design of this thermometer is great, much easier to use and read than the glass tube type. However I don't feel there are enough gradations on the dial. Trying to guess where 113 degrees is between 100 and 150 is a little iffy. I guess I like to be more accurate."
1,Bad Candy Thermometer,"The only positive thing I can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well. Other than that, it is difficult to discern temperatures between the 0 - 50 marks. Also, it tends to read low so that the candy is much warmer than the read out indicates. Since using this thermometer, I have ruined more batches of fudge than I care to think about. If you want a good candy thermometer, don't buy this one."
2,Not what I expected of Kaiser,"I looked forward to receiving these, since Kaiser's such an established name in bakeware. The hinges rusted on the first washing! Otherwise, they are more flimsy than I thought they would be. I purchased another springform pan in the La Forme line and would definitely stick with that one. It's worth paying a few more dollars to get a heavy duty pan."
3,Not for those who bake cheesecake often,"These Springform pans are cute and turn out very nice cheesecakes, but I would recommend tin metal pans rather than nonstick pans for those who bake often. I am still looking for a small Springform pan made with tin--the nonstick version of a Springform pan performs more consistently and with higher quality. HOWEVER, the novelty of a small cheesecake makes these Springform pans very fun to use."
5,Grilla Gear is tops,"Grilla Gear is tops in the Bar-B-Que world in my opinion. I am a moderately accomplished BBQ user who happened upon Grilla Gear at my local Fred Meyer. I bought the spatula, tongs, and gloves, and have to admit, they are the best I've ever used! They are built sturdy, and they are built to last. They don't retain heat, so you won't burn yourself. For my money, Grilla Gear are the best BBQ accessories I have ever had."
5,Where do Balloons Go,"If you have ever watched a balloon floating skyward and wondered where it would end up, you will enjoy this book.This is an imaginative book it helps to think better where do balloons go when they escape his/her owner's hands!It creates a sense of wonder that almost everyone can relate to it. The colorful illustrations helps the children's imagination. I lended this book from the Los Angeles Public Library to use it with kinder classroom, as I read it for the first time, I became so engaged in wonder and so filled with nice memories of my own childhood and feelings my daughter had experienced when she wanted a balloon so bad and it scaped from her hands, that I highly recommend it for all ages. I liked the fold-out picture in the center, it adds surprise for the young reader's mind."
4,Great book... okay artwork,"I loved the book, I just didn't like the artwork. Very busy and messy. My son loves loves balloons but he could barely make them out on the busy pages. I'd definitely get another artist or at least make the artwork cleaner."
4,nice game,"I am not a spring chicken but this game is fun, except I got lost about 5 minutes into it, however my 16 yr old son figured it out, (as usual). Its has good graphics for the age of the game and its fairly easy. I think its fun..."
5,4 Dean Rarities in one Box Set,"4 Dean Rarities in one Box Set -I loved watching these rare James Dean interviews, bio, TV programs and films.Amazon has forgotten to list the 4 so I do so here.1 - Harvest,2- The Bells Of Cockaigne,3- The James Dean Story,4- Hill Number One."
5,awesome chalk!,this is the stickiest chalk ever!and I love to get bulks of chalk!!this guys know how to ship!! it was fast!!and well packed even though it doesn't have to be!
5,A Perfect Baby Book.. they haven't left a thing out,"I received this baby book as a gift when my second child was born, and wish I had had it for my first. They thought of everything and added adorable illustrations. If you are looking for a baby book, this is a great one to get and to give!"
1,A clumsy attempt,"Not much need be said about this book. The plot is far-fetched, and I never accepted the premise or the denouement. Moreover, the jeopardy is cooked. The writing is full of cliches. The characters are flat and unbelievable. The atmosphere is not there. The dialogue is clumsy and stilted.One has to wonder how something like this passes the editor's blue pencil. It was published, obviously, because there is an audience for the Clarks' work, although I can't imagine who they are; I picture suburban women with lots of cocktail rings. If this be wrong and on me proved...."
5,Deck the bookshelf,"It was with reluctance that I started to read this book. I had read reviews and had decided not to buy this book even though I don't miss a MHC book that is released. I borrowed Deck the Halls from a relative and sat down one afternoon to read it. And boy was I surprised! This wasn't the horrible book it was made out to be. In fact, I quite enjoyed it. Yes, you do find out the whodunit part quite early in the story but I found myself reading a breakneck speed to see if Luke and Rosita would be saved. I liked the comedy aspect of this book. It added a new dimension to the story. I found myself laughing at Petey all the way through If you are looking for a light, quick read pick up this book. You'll definitely enjoy it. (And now it's time for me to go buy my own copy)"
2,Not the usual Mary Higgins Clark,"As an avid reader of Mary Higgins Clark, I found myself disappointed in her latest effort. All of the usual suspense tactics that I usually enjoy in her books were missing. It was at best, a mere distraction, but definitely not what I would label a page turner."
3,Interesting light read...,"However, I had it figured out too soon~ The characters from past novels were a mystery to me, so my grasp of their importance was nil. I really liked the new characters introduced and found the antics of the ""injured"" novelist amusing as she tried to function from her hospital bed. Include the Christmas season and a kidnapping by amateurs and you've got a story with mild intrigue and danger. Enjoyable yet predictable ending."
3,"It May Be Fun, But I STILL Think It Should Have Been Longer!","Floigan Brothers: Episode 1 is was strange, weird, funny, clever, and brillient game. I don't know how many times I broke out laughing, but it was quite a few times(Those movie spoofs don't hurt either). I was having fun, untill after about an hour (Mabye a little more) I had beaten it! ...This game was shorter then The Bouncer (And in case you didn't know, that games about 90 minutes long)! I still recomend it, just don't be expecting this to keep you busy for the week because it won't (Unless you take your VERY sweet time in compleating this!)."
3,The Crazy Floigan Brothers,"Floigan Bros. is a pretty cool game for Dreamcast, but it was very very short. It can be beaten in a day or less. There's alot of camera problems too. It's still a good game though. The voice overs are great, and the characters are funny. The game will remind you of an old Saturday morning cartoon. It's a good game to play when you bored or just wanna have fun."
1,Should have used a tarp and bungie cords instead,"After having multiple installation issues to begin with, it started to break apart. The cheap plastic holding the pull cord broke and was followed by the it physically breaking ripping itself apart. Luckily it fell apart while parked, with no weight on it and didn't fly off and hit someone. If you are looking for a rolling cover, look some place else."
3,Not as Shown,"The photo shows 4 holders. What I received was a holder with an ivory mouthpiece and a chrome end that holds the cigarette and 2 fake cigarettes. The description does say that you get 1 holder but I thought the photo was misleading. The chrome piece on mine had large black scratches on it. I contacted the company about this and offered an exchange but they credited my charge card instead. I am satisfied with the company but think that they should change the photo to what you get! I figured that I got a bonus because the description said nothing about the fake cigarettes. However, I would do business with them again since their customer service was fine. I would've raised the stars to 4 if the chrome wasn't scratched."
4,very good but missing non-fiction,"This is an excellent book as a reference for fiction books for girls. In that respect I would rate it with 10. It is missing descriptions of non-fiction books, however, whereas the boys' version of this book (""600 Great Books for Boys"") has substantial non-fiction sections. I think this is a serious flaw, perhaps even sexist. Hopefully this will be rectified in the next edition."
4,Good but not great...,"It seems Schleich has several different levels of quality when it comes to making their whales (probably all of their animals)... and it seems also related to where the toy was manufactured, and when. This right whale whale looks real enough, but unlike Schleich Germany which manufactures their whales in Portugal - this one is Made in China. So rather than being intricately detailed, it is glossy with painted on details, rather than carved in details - which doesn't make it look so realistic. But for the cheap price they're asking - you get what you pay for. My suggestion is IF you care about the whale being detailed, spend the extra money and look for one from Schleich Germany with an older date on it, as opposed to this one which was dated 2005 and made in China. But if you just want a whale toy shaped like a right whale - then this should be fine."
5,Adults and Kids Will Both Love It,"This is basically Mario Brothers set in dinosaur land. I highly recommend it if you have 4-5 year olds who want to play with the game boy. The introductory levels are easy enough that my kindergartner can enjoy it, and the later levels are very challenging for older players as well. It's really a lot of fun."
3,What happened....,I love all the Tombraider games but this has to be the worst one graphically. It did offer some nuances but it was so slow loading that I finally got so frustrated with it - I quit.
1,*MUST BUY THIS AMAZING*,i have seen the game and have played the gemae thought it was excellent and great i hope that all you readers get it i found that the idea of the game was pants but the gameplay was fantastic so was the graphics
2,disappointing,"looks like this game was put on the market long before it was actually completed. Lots of glitches, awkward camera angles, rough control of movement in general. It's a good thing the game allows you to ""save"" at any point during play, cause you're going to die a lot! She's hard to control and will fall to her death with monotonous regularity *yawn*. Other than that, pleasant enough graphics and story line (typical tombraider stuff). Nothing innovative and would have greatly benefited from a little more work prior to game release... boo hoo.. definitely rent before buying."
2,Great game (if you can manage to beat the glitches first).,"I was excited to get this game... Until I played it. The game itself is fun, but a lot of the camera angles suck. I'm also COMPLETELY stuck in one part, because a glitch is preventing me from getting what I need. Which means I'm stuck in a club with repetitive techno music I can't shut off unless I decide to completely restart my game. It also has lousy maps. I had to just run around until I started recognizing buildings. Its not too clear on where your supposed to go. Like I said, if you have a LOT of time and patience on your hands to get past the glitches, it's a fun game."
4,angel of darkness,"I LIKE THE GAME,WITH IT'S NEW FEATURES AND GRAPHICS. THE ONLY PROBLEM,IS THE CONTROLLER. THEY SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE OLD ONE."
1,Seller was great!!,"with no fault of the seller, i have to give this game an F. It was just a slow moving horrible game. I didnt even have it in for 15 mins before i stopped playing. However the Seller was great, quick shipping very nice transaction!!"
2,What happened to Tomb Raider?,This game [is] really [sub-par]. The graphics are the best thing about the game. As a gamer addicted to Tomb Raider this game was really disappointing because it strayed so far away from the original idea. The levels are short and it is a real pain trying to figure out the new button configuration. It is also lame how different icons will appear to let the gamer know what they should be doing such as the hand icon that lets you know that Lara can open a cabinet or door. I just want my Tomb Raider back. Definitely not worth the money nor the time it will take to get used to the buttons and new moves.
2,Gets old,"This game gets soooooooo old after a while. There are goodies and badies.Badies: 1) gets very old! 2) bugs and glitches! 3) controls are screwed up! 4) on some areas u can't control the camera!Goodies: 1) the story is good! 2) u can play as 2 characters!3) u have more guns and hand-to-hand combat!I like the Tomb Raider for normal Playstation, but this... this is very disappointing! :-("
2,Disappointment,"This game is a huge disappointment because they spent so much time working on it but it still is crap. Awful sound and the camera is still the games big problem. It's not very long and after you beat, you don't want to play it again so you wasted money. don't buy it."
1,Angel of Darkness Game,"Game is Ancient. Her fingers are Squared in this lol.A disappointment after all the other titles i have played.But it Reminds you how the Game started and how much it has Evolved.Great for Young kids starting to learn how to play. Will keep this only because im collecting Tomb Raider items. But Not worth more than the six bucks i paid.Very good shape, delivery was Very fast even beat a book i ordered a week before i ordered this."
4,Be Careful If You Have an Orally-Fixated Cat!!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great product, but as soon as I unpacked it and saw the thin electric cord I knew it was going to be a problem. I attempted to put tape over all exposed cord and tuck away the extra behind the feeder, out of sight. But my food-obsessed rescue cat got impatient with the feeder one day and chewed right through that flimsy cord. I wasn't home when it happened and I think she may have gotten a jolt, but I couldn't detect any injury to her. My one suggestion is that a more heavy duty cord be provided."
5,Ahh my aching back,Actually I learned about this product in the therapist office. When rubbed on my back I got relief and so I looked to see what he was using and it was this product.
3,"Intriguing, but not quite accurate","I found this book very interesting. I liked the combination of romance, mystery, and time travel. I love books about time travel. But this book wasn't quite historically accurate. The way the author kept pointing out what girls supposedly couldn't do in 1895 got a little silly after a while. A line that particularly got to me was, ""Let's race? I'll win? Girls weren't allowed to do both!"". Come on! That line was ridiculous even by 1895 standards. While women in 1895 didn't have as many rights as they have today, it wasn't as bad as Caroline Cooney says it is. I think she just wrote things like that for dramatic purposes."
1,It is a don't read!,Out of 5 stars i give this one a -5! I mean I like Cooney's book. But htis series was not one of her best ones.
4,what a book!,"I borrowed this book from my friend [the face on the milk carton] and i just read it all during classes it was so great! i felt like i was really inside the book ,so if you are looking for a mi-sti-ri-us book and romantic, confusing exciting, thrilling book all in one, i highly recomend all the books of this series!"
5,"a wonderful, romantic book","This is a wonderful book. A classic romance noval. Altough sad at the end still delightful and a bit humourus. Exciting. I could take the end and I understood the book better,although I do not recommend it, because I accidentally read the second book first. Shows romantic side of Cooney."
5,Winter House,"Winter House gives fabulous ideas for warming up a home. While Moss's taste is specific, I appreciated her practical ""how to"" advice for each space in a home from guest room comforts to inviting entryways. The book is full of photos of Moss's own winter house, however her advice transcends her style and would work for any home large, small, country or contemporary."
2,Winter House,"Overall, I was sort of disappointed in this book. I'm used to more pizazz in a decorating book. This lack it."
2,Succeeded in turning a great theme into a boring book of clichés.,"Rarely have I been so disappointed when receiving a book. 'Nouveau riche' is a great understatement. The author needs some serious help in modesty, taste and self-restraint... a 101 course on imagination and creativity wouldn't hurt either. She has succeeded in turning a great theme into a boring book of clichés.I really wish I could get my money back... what a waste!"
2,Did not like it,"The book is about the authors own house. There is no sign of taste, culture, tradition or education. Its just noveau riche."
1,Dry as a Bone,"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee."
1,Just Terrible.,"We have a gluten free household of 5. No one in our family likes these. My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox. The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth. Have a glass of water nearby if you try these. I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.(I won't throw the box away. I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)"
5,Cocert for George,This is a wonderful concert and it arrived in excellent condition for a great price. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a great show, ""Isnt it a pity"" was so nice, Billy Preston has such a nice voice...what a jam...Tom Petty did a wonderful job on ""Taxman"" and ""I need you""....who is Tom Brown??? he did a very nice rendition of ""Here Comes The Sun"", Sam Brown really rocked the house...she was awesome. Of course Georges old band mates Sir Paul and Ringo were great too.... verey nicely done by all performers....George would have been proud,,,, Dahni is a dead ringer for his father....HIGHLY RECOMMENEDED!!!!!"
5,A Concert for George,"In case there is anyone on the planet who hasn't before recognized the talent of George Harrison, there is so much love and good music on this DVD that will keep you singing, smiling, and maybe crying many times over."
5,Exceptional Concert and DVD,"This is easily the best music concert DVD that I own (or have seen).The performances by Joe Brown, Billy Preston, Ringo Starr, Sam Brown, Eric Clapton & Paul McCartney are all *exceptional* in the truest sense of the word. The quality of sound and videography is superb as well.Buy this DVD if you like even one of the singers above. You will not be disappointed. Heck, just read the other reviews on this concert. It's rated 5 stars for a reason!"
5,Peers,"This is so well done, so classy, so obviously a labor of love and respect and intelligent choices, that it is stunning to contemplate the lightly tapped well of talent in this man. While Harrison may not have been as fast-food prolific as the Lennon-McCartney duo, this tribute to a collection of his best work makes it inarguable that at his creative best, HE WAS THEIR PEER. He had the stuff, Mr. Ramon. I miss the collaborations that might have - ahem - taken Wings - but for ego, pride and condescension."
5,Must have for any Beatle/George Harrison fan,"I received this DVD for XMAS and I must have watched and or listened to it 10 times already. Basically Eric Clapton gathers up George's friends at Royal Albert Hall and performs one of the best shows I've seen on DVD. The first half hour on the the complete concert disc is Rave Shankar performing a piece written for George. I dig it. There's the great stuff from the Beatles as well as some really cool solo stuff. 3 highlights for me: Billy Preston ""Isn't a Pity,"" Paul McCartney ""Something,"" Eric Clapton/Paul McCartney ""While my Guitar gently weeps.""The 5.1 mix and the encoding on both discs is awesome. I very highly recommend this disc set. It's a great celebration of George's life & music and a chance to hear those songs played by one of the greatest group of musicians ever assembled."
5,Easy!!!,"This has got to be the best and handiest map i've ever had! It's small, easy to carry, important buildings on the map. London was our last stop, on out backpacking trip, so we've seen A LOT of useless ones. This map also has top tourist places from food, to shopping to museums, etc. It also has the TUBE (underground) map, on it."
4,very good,The gameboy advance i got was shipped with in very reasonable time and with reasonable quality the system itself is actually better than expected and that it is well worth the twenty bucks i spent.
3,too little too late,"yes I bought one of these bad boys the first day it came out and it was great, but i have a few complaints firstly and most importantly most games that don't have brilliantly colored graphics, like Rayman or Super Mario will be almost invisible, the graphics are too dark, a backlit display should have been implemented, the other complaint is lack of games, yeah there are a few games that came out for this system bust most are mediocre or rereleases such as dragon warrior or super mario, I love the new Castlevania, but there is only so many times you can play through that game, the new super mario looks good with a remake of super mario world but i have yet to pick it up, i would only suggest buying this if you can play in direct light and need to waste time on a regular basis, the graphics are great and there are many game supported by it, but there are some features that are missing that make using this system a hassle."
4,"Man, my girlfriend hates this thing.","I tend to carry it everywhere, and will quickly slip into antisocial mode as I crush opposing forces in Advance Wars, or slam a volley ball into Canadians in Super Dodge Ball Advance. I wholly plan to get Mario Kart, and am looking forward to more quality titles on this little powerhouse.The only complaint is the same one you read everywhere else: no internal light! You will have to tip the angle quite a bit, and sometimes your arms will get tired from holding the game boy in some contorted way to let you see.But anyway, this is a great little system, and well worth the investment."
5,Best handheld system ever!,"The Gamebay Advance is the greatest invention man has ever created. The graphics are amazing on this thing of beauty. Gameboy color was a joke with its 18 different colors and about 10 pixels. This is completely different. There are about a million pixels and colors! The wide, rather than tall, composure of it makes it much easier to hold. It is very light and the screen it much bigger. It has been stretched out into a more widescreen format. The shoulder buttons add for more different gameplay. This is a must buy considering the price now!"
1,Defective Slide Projector,I have now returned the defective slide projector to the sender - Have no idea how I am going to get my $116.00 plus back.
4,Good special purpose tool,"Firstly, the Bosch PS10 works competently and without surprise. It is solidly constructed too. I like it, but it is most certainly a special purpose tool for me because I already own (and love) aBosch PS20-2A. If the PS20 won't fit, then I'll use the PS10. However, because of the relative sizes of the tools, the PS20 is what will most likely be at hand.So, why only four stars? I think the tool head could be smaller to fit into even tighter spaces. After all, this thing's special purpose is fitting into places other drivers can't. Why not go all in and engineer with that idea in mind?My PS10 is a refurb, so the price was rather comfortable. It came with a recharger and two batteries that also fit my PS20 and my PS40. That, I really like."
3,Needs more Torque,It doesn't have enough torque to drive a 3 inch deck screw in to fir without a pilot hole.
3,Builtin Pump Leaks,"I have a water-bed frame that I put the air mattress in, and the first time I used this mattress it leaked. I made it half-way through the night before needing to add air. After about two days, I could actually hear the hissing leak, it was at the built-in pump. I tried reinforcing the attachment area with strong glue, and that didn't help. Then I was able to feel that the pump itself was leaking through the plate. There is a plate with two screws covering the switch and the exhaust, and it isn't tight enough. I tried screwing it tighter, but couldn't. If I pushed the plate tight to the pump, the leak stopped. Since the mattress is in a frame, I am able to wedge a small block between the pump and the frame to keep the plate pressed in. Works like a charm, the mattress stays inflated all night long. I'm trying to work out a better solution, but at least I can use the mattress, which is very nice otherwise."
2,Coleman Queen w/ Built-in Pump,I also own an Aerobed which I feel is a much more superior product than this Coleman. The power cord on this bed is not detachable making it awkward when putting on bed sheets. I've used another Coleman model where the cord is detachable and it is my fault to assume this would be the same. The power cord is fairly short so you have to either drag the whole bed to an outlet or attach it to an extension cord.This bed also flattens quicker than my Aerobed.
1,"when it works, it works","broke right after we started using. had to spend a lot of money send it back. the new one that;s sent to us has some problems on the pump. I have to hold it all the time while its pumping, really annoying. tired of dealing with Customer service , so that's it. we are keeping it -a broken air mattress"
3,Not comfortable to use.,"These tongs work well, easily cleaned, however, the handles are very uncomfortable because the metal is very thin and flat. They would be perfect if they were easier on your hands."
1,Not pleasing to the hand,"I bought this set and another set as replacements for a salad set that was lost at a church potluck. I hoped these would work for us, as a set fastened together is harder to lose, but they don't feel very good in the hand. The edges of the handles are too sharp to be comfortable. Back they go. We kept the other set, which were two separate pieces."
4,Unusual and fun,Interesting concept and good execution. The movie drug in a few places and I intended to give it a 3 star rating until the last scene between Jose Pablo Cantillo and Taryn Manning. That scene alone was worth four stars.
3,Product was what it was promised to be,"The poem is nice and so is the matting looks nice. It would be better if it was framed but it is still a nice product for a nurse's gift. It does take a little while to process orders, but it was delievered as promissed.GM"
1,DAMN SHAME,"I couldn't believe it when I saw it. P has sold out, he is losing the flare he had before Ghetto D. His first movie Bout It was tight. It was independent , and realy badly done, but the story was tight as hell. This movie he uses a bad fake Italian accent. I have been a No Limit fan since the begining. After Ghetto D the whole family has gone done the drain. What ever it was you had befor you made it huge you've lost. Please get it back, For all ya fans on the street bump'n ya p**p. Stay up Players, Ride till ya Die. Represent' da South."
5,It was da bomb!,"Man, if you saw this movie, you would really like it, Especially if you like ""NO LIMIT"" like I do. Master P, Silkk ""The Shocker"", Snoop and a whole bunch of other jammin artists were rockin dat joint. It was da bomb!!!"
3,kids' liked gameboy color better,Gameboy advance did not go over as well as gameboy color. The picture quality is not as good on advance as it is on gameboy color.
5,Awesome Handheld,Gameboy Advance rules! It has great graphics and it is handheld! It can also play any Gameboy game ever made. Any! This is a must-buy for any gamer. If you do you won't regret it.
1,SCREEN POORLY LIT,"I am amazed how great the game looked at toys r us with the mario brothers game loaded. But, when at home playing other games, the screen is too dark, even with a light. I checked out nintendo site for problems. Apparently they've had a large volume of complaints for this because it's on their commonly asked questions. They say it's due to the color palette gaming companies use..., also not all gameboy color games will work. The only time it looked half way decent was on a sunny day outside. Disappointed i took mine back. Other than that, if you don't want to worry about your eyes, or only buying ninetendo games- mario, donkey kong, the sound and graphics are better-if you can see them. Nintendo says they are working out glitches-I think it's better to wait."
2,Gameboy advance is not to good.,"First of all. There is no backlite or frontlite. You can't adjust the brightness like you can on the Sp or the DS lite. It is way to dark. It doesn't seem like a big deal because you can just go near a light source, WRONG!! Even when you go near a light source that you still can barely see the screen whatsoever. The graphics for this system is really outdated and really boring. It is not 32 bit it is 16, (which was still really good for that time). But now, it is not good. The DS and the PSP's graphics are now considered really good and 3-D. Most of the games for the DS and the PSP are 3-D anyways. Even the games that are 2-D look so much better than the GBA. It is too outdated. The games for the system o the other hand are pretty good. But you can play GBA games on the DS, so what is the point anyways. That is the only good thing about the system. I say either go for the Nintendo DS Lite. Now!!!"
1,Loud not enough power,Loud not enough power. When you have the heat on it makes a louder sound. I was hoping it was more powerful.
2,monkey,"A good story but it is only the beginning, almost an introduction or backstory, to the Tales of Monkey. Frankly I was let down."
4,Quality tool,This seems to be a top quality tool. The fit and finish are very good. I plan on buying the smaller sizes and making a complete set of these.
5,One of the best gifts you can give your child!,"I was given this set as a child and I enjoyed the books so much that read each of them multiple times.As I grew older, I made a point to find the ""real versions"" of each book in the set. This gift was an important stepping stone in my becoming an avid reader.I feel reading encourages the development of longer attention spans. It should be no surprise that kids that read tend to do better academically than kids that limit themselves to tv and video games.Sets like this do a great job of interesting children in reading and are not only a fun gift but also an investment in your child's intellectual development."
5,Excellent quality and price,I purchased this line cord for an old telephone that needed a new cord. It arrived promptly and I was so pleased with the quality and price when I saw it. The phone is now in use and I am happy!
5,Years ahead of their time in the health field,Over forty years ago I was at death's door and the writings of Paul Bragg and his daughter Patrica helped save my life. As a result of their impact on my life I now conduct Lifestyle Semiars and share that which I leared from Paul and Patricia Bragg. They were light years ahead of their time. Pastor Bob East
5,Life changing,Has literally changed my life . I haven't had to take my loratab for 2 weeks I haven't had a headaches or hot flashes .i have have many extreme health problems which have made a drastic reversal on which dr said I wouldn't get better at all. This has been amazing and is worth so much more than anything they could ever charge.
4,Weight loss,"There is only one thing I don't totally agree with, and that is how much the authors suggest about fasting. Once 24 hour period per month is sufficient, not once per week. I ordered this book from Amazon(my favorite place to shop)!"
5,Awsome,One of the best series that I have ever Read! I defentally recomend it for any ages! I am 17 and I love it!
2,Not a page turner,"My 8 year old daughter loves unicorns, so I'm always on the lookout for new stories about them to read together. This one just didn't have the ""magic"" we were looking for. The characterizations were very flat. The snotty rich girl was a cartoon stereotype, and we just didn't care one way or the other what would happen to the main character. I was happy that my daughter was discriminating enough to say that she did not want to go on to book two. Maybe we were spoiled by having recently read ""Into the Land of the Unicorns"" by Bruce Coville, which is the book I recommend you read instead of this one"
2,Give me a little warning...,"Like some of the other readers that have left reviews, I bought this book at a book fair. I'd never heard of the author, but just thought it looked interesting. I loved it and couldn't put it down...until the end...if you want to call it that. There WASN'T an ending because this is a series of books that must be all read together to get the entire story. I wouldn't have been nearly as upset if I'd had a little warning that this book was a dead end street if you didn't have the next ones. The tiny #1 on the spine was the ONLY indication that it was part of a series--seems like a crappy marketing ploy by the publisher to me.Despite all this, I would recommend the book to fantasy lovers and horse lovers alike. If it hadn't been so good, I wouldn't have been nearly as upset when I got to the end. Before you go out and read it, though, be warned that you'll have to find or buy the other books in order to continue enjoying the story."
5,A Great Fantasy Book,"I really liked this book because I think fantasy is most definitely the best kind of book. I got this book because it seemed to be a lot like the books by Bruce Coville, The Unicorn Chronicles. For any fantasy lover, I strongly recommend The Unicorn Chronicles. I was a little dissapointed in the ending of The Road to Balinor. It is obviously meant to be in a series because it kind of leaves you hanging. Also, it is kind of hard to figure out. But all in all, it was a great book that I will treasure forever. I can't wait to read the others in the series!"
4,An enjoyable fantasy tale,"""The Road to Balinor,"" by Mary Stanton, is number 1 in the Unicorns of Balinor series. This is a fantasy tale about a race of intelligent unicorns who live in a realm apart from, but connected to, Earth. As the story opens we discover that one of the unicorns and his human companion have both been injured and are in a precarious situation in the human world.Overall I enjoyed the story. Stanton is especially effective in her presentation of interspecies relationships in a fantasy setting. There is also an intriguing villain.At times I found the language a little too corny and New Age-y for my tastes. I also didn't like the fact that the book really doesn't hold up as a stand-alone story; the cliffhanger ending seems to lead directly into volume 2. But the imaginative story, together with some clever touches along the way, make it a solid fantasy effort."
1,Not a good album,"I consider myself a big fan of the Cowboy Junkies - I have at least 12 of their CDs - so I was excited to buy this recording on SACD. Unfortunately, this album goes even further than their next most recent effort (Miles from Our Home) toward eliminating all the best aspects of their playing. Margo Timmins' voice does not benefit from the type of amplification used on this album, nor is the band good at (with a few exceptions - e.g. on Pale Sun, Crescent Moon) integrating distortion and a harder sound with her vocals. I found that after a few attempts, I couldn't even bring myself to put the disc in my player, despite the fact that it's one of only 7 or 8 SACDs I own!"
1,"Love the Band, But Open Disappoints.","I'm all for a band spreading their musical wings and exploring new arenas, but I have to say Open is a tough one to love. I'm a huge Junkie fan, and will remain one despite this cd. Michael takes his love of guitar feedback and distortion to another level (depth?) and all it did was to distract me. But all in all, I still rate the Cowboy Junkies as one of the most underrated bands ever. See them in concert and you'll know what I mean!"
5,AWESOME FLOAT!,"This float is very durable and very big. We had 7 people on this floating down a rapid creek. We ran into tree branches, rocks, you name it and it never go a hole in it. I highly recommend this. WEll worth the money! It did finally pop when my daughter put a hook through it, but we definetly got our moneys worth before that happened. OH, the palm tree doesn't really stay up too long. We got tired of it laying down, so we just cut it off."
4,a movie to haunt your memory,"I watched this movie when I was in my youth. The Entity is one of those movies that you can't remember the name of the movie, but you can remember the scary parts! The movies that always make your skin crawl are the ones that say ""based on true events or happenings"", this is one of those very movies."
5,Now On DVD,"The Entity is now available on DVD and it's my favorite scary film. Who knows why these strange things happen to other people or why? This film puts you in the shoes of a mother who is touched by something out of this world. If you have seen it before you will enjoy seeing it again, as long as you have someone to watch it with. It still sends chills up my spine."
4,good read,"this was a very good book about the plague and besides explaining what the plague exactly did, it went into detail of how it spread so far and wide, due to weather, environment, animals, etc. recommend it for those interested in the black plague."
1,Ziegler said it better,"For those who delight in derivation, try this. Or get Philip Ziegler's book on the same subject, which is miles better."
5,Super cool,"My young son's love Harvey. His crane is magnetic and they love pretending he is a tow truck by attaching the front end of another engine to him. Or, just sticking as many paper clips to him as will stay. Great inspiration for imagination!"
5,My son loves it.,I have a 3 year old who loves playing with Harvey. He isn't a standard train so that makes him more fun for my son. He likes that he is different.
4,Zoom adapter works well,"I bought this for use on a Windows 7 64-bit system. Used the downloaded driver for Vista 64 bit, installed fine. One bug I have noticed - if I put the computer to sleep Skype forgets about the zoom adapater and routes my calls to the speaker and (non-existent) microphone, not the zoom adapter.It's a bit of a pain to dial a million digits for a local call. You have to dial 011 1 xxx xxx-yyyy * to make a call. So, I generally dial out using Skype directly, and the handset works fine for incoming calls."
3,"Good idea, but needs improvement","The box performs as advertised. The software has a problem working at 100% - I have had to re-install the software to get the phone to work. Also, dialing out from the phone is too complicated for some users. It requires special symbols and numbers before the ten digit phone number. Dialing from Skype itself is simple though. Works great with cordless phone and multiple handsets. I highly recommend connecting the landline to the adapter as well."
1,DOESN'T WORK ON MAC OSX,"This looked great until I found out (the hard way) that the software only works on PCs. I based my decision to buy on the reviews, not the specs, so for any Mac users out there about to make the same mistake I did - DON'T.Low rating is because it's lame for products to be PC only. Seriously. It's 2010."
5,Love this product,"I just installed it on Vista, and I think it's terrific. I wanted an adapter to be able to hook up my cordless and use Skype to make calls, but I was skeptical after reading a lot of bad reviews on other products (d-link in particular). A lot of people mentioned problems with drivers, call quality, etc, but I picked Zoom after reading the reviews here, and the product actually surprised me. The installation was a breeze, and it works perfectly, with the landline, without the landline, calls to Skype, calls from Skype, even if the computer is off you can still use your landline ... it's exactly what I needed.I'm now gonna stop using the landline for a couple of months and use Skype only, and if that works I'll ditch the landline altogether.In short, great product, totally worth the price. I actually got it from buy.com, where they have a $[...] dollar off deal if you signup for a credit card, so it ended up costing me [...] bucks. Best deal ever."
1,garbage item,this is the worst item i have ever purchased you would think you could pick up a can etc but the metal is so soft it bends on almost every thing & you have to keep straightening it RUDEDOGSDAD@YAHOO.COM
2,ergonomically inadaquite,It picks up well but the grip handle hurts your hand after a while. It could have been designed better
1,Too fast and too annoying,"wish I could give this more stars but I just can't. This is the same company (same people in the video) as Say, Sing & Sign. This video is just too fast to really learn how to sign the songs. They try to break it down first but it's too fast to learn it. You'll have to do a lot of rewinding if you want to learn to sign along. As with the Say, Sing & Sign videos, the signer doesn't sing out loud the songs but instead she mouths the words to the songs. It's so annoying because sometimes the singing voices are kids or a man. It looks so stupid when she mouths those songs. The best children's signing videos, in my opinion, are Signing Time and My Baby Can Talk. Before buying We Sign More Animals I would suggest you see if your library has it first. I have written other reviews so please read them too."
4,Green G-Bones Review,"I love skating, but for the record am no great skater yet. As a beginner I've been trying out a lot of different types of wheels to find my favorites, so I'm comparing these to Spitfire Bighead Softies, Ratbone 100's, and Flashbacks. The 97A Durometer on these G-Bones means that they're hard with just a little bit of give. So, they are pretty hard on side-walks, are surprisingly smooth on asphalt, and on smooth concrete pool-shapes they slide easily. They seem to perform best, and better than any of the previous wheels I mentioned, on Ramps (straight, mini-, and half-pipes). The design is also really cool, although I was surprised at how quickly it rubs off. I used mini-logo bearings and a Zero-Cole Cobra Deck with Independent trucks. Next time I might get something just a bit softer for all-around skating, but just for ramps these are my favorite."
4,I love herbs,This is a small but very practical book about herbs. It is like a dictionary discribing herbs one by one in alphabetic order. Easy to read and with good tips. Important for who wants cultivate herbs. Few photos.
1,There are better alternatives,"This was a required textbook for a course that I recentely took. The context is very abstract and difficult to understand. It's about high-level abstraction of three knowledge-creation methodologies: actor, system, and analytic approach. Most students were lost in its content including myself. Even the school is considering using another one in the future. Save your money if you are trying to learn how to do research. You'll have better luck on research methods by going with books written by Cooper and Schindler, Robson, or Crewell."
3,"good, but not the best","I got this for my mom and she tells me that it is fairly accurate, but because it is so long she has a hard time keeping it from falling, even with the little clip thing. I think a regular thermometer would have satisfied her just as much. it's just not worth the cost."
5,Warm and Great,"I wear this sweatshirt to work when its cold, and it has held up for 3 years. bought a new one, but I still wear the old one to work. its faded, it has holes, and worn out around the edges and considering the abuse this sweat shirt went through it has held up great"
2,"comfortable, but I have yet to find any use for it.","If there's a slight chill in the air and that bothers you, this jacket would be a good thing to wear. Any weather beyond that and you're probably going to need something else...I usually don't bother with finding a jacket and putting it on just b/c there's a mild breeze in the air."
2,Lenny in unfamiliar territory,"The celestial vision and final certainty of Bruckner was beyond Leonard Bernstein, or perhaps Bernstein was too far beyond and above Bruckner, a simple man who Knew what he Knew. More than ten years after, I still remember my initial disappointment, and mounting amusement, when I played the Bernstein CD. The only worth of Bernstein's parody-like interpretation is comparative, and as a lesson that even geniuses have their limits. The best starting point for appreciating this greatest of symphonies is the version by Carlo Maria Giulini, who proceeded with perfect humility to capture Bruckner's vision of heaven, the closest I'll probably ever get to it."
5,Brilliance Penned,I'm about 1/4th of the way through and can't put the book down. Edwards is one of my heroes and so reading this vivid account of his life is amazing.Definitely recommended for any serious Christian looking for some inspiration.
2,Oldies not nessesarily goldies,"While this this album contains some of Benoit's earlier work, it is mostly in collusion with other artists. The other artists also arrange the songs, so the familiar 'Benoit' sound is not obvious in any of these recordings. Benoit seems to be just a pickup, studio musician. There is not enough of Benoit's piano playing featured in most of the songs on this album. If you are a collector and want to have a complete set of David Benoit's albums, then you have to buy this. If you buy Benoit's albums for their musical content, save your money and pass on this album."
4,Great Suggestions!,I found this book an easy read and very helpful. The suggestions and solutions provided by the author as well as other working moms are refreshing and workable. For what ever age your children are there are ideas here that can actually be used by most working moms. I keep this book handy for a quick reference. I'm glad I purchased this one.
3,Good for the price,"Not bad. Hard to get it to work on Windows 7 32bit since no drivers came with package, but I eventually found some drivers that would work.Overall it is getting the job done."
1,Worthless,This cable did not work at all. I had to buy another one from Best Buys that work perfect. I wondered why it was only $10.
1,total and complete trash,"I originally wrote wonderful in my seller feedback, however, I misspoke, I used it for the first time - pieces of plastic broke off, the other pieces kept sliding apart and the cork jammed in it!The biggest bummer is my fault, I have already thrown away the box and shredded the receipt --- my major bad!"
4,Has Helped me make a discovery,"Over all, this is a great collection... Has a little bit of everything in it.I've been searching for an answer for the need of an album that would helped me expand my insight into the blues, and this, along with a B.B. King album has done so. I've never felt such an understanding between music and raw emotion before until discovering the blues, and this album just helped me along my journey. I've understood the discipline of classical, and the spirit of jazz, along with the passion needed to play both, but it wasn't until the blues that the raw emotion sunk in. I also would have to thank Jimi Hendrix for introducing the blues to me in a rock form, and thank this album for kicking it off."
3,"Fun Game, Controls are terrible","I enjoyed playing this game, the only draw back is the the controls!! I got so frustrated trying to get the character to move left, right etc. Whoever thought up these controls for this game sure did a BooBoo!! It's not like most games I have played where you move the joy stick and the character moves up or down, left to right, NO you basically have to stop her then turn her left to right, up, down, these controls are LOUSY. The story line is fantastic and it has beautiful scenery. Once you get the hang of moving her around its not bad. Good Luck."
2,flimsy,"I have this corkscrew and it's a little flimsy. The rivets allow the worm to wiggle from side to side and it just doesn't have good fit and finish and isn't comfortable in the hand. If I were to buy another one I'd probably go with a model that has a nicer handle and a ""two-step"" feature to make it easier to pull the cork."
1,Be careful with headphones!!,"You can blow out your eardrums with this CD if you're listening to it through headphones on a computer. Lost Highway, the label, has ""helpfully"" included a multimedia interface that pops up when you insert the disc into a computer. The interface lacks play, stop, FF, RW, or volume controls. (RealPlayer, Windows Media, and Winamp won't play this CD.)Anyway, the thing is, the interface automatically cranks your CD Audio Balance up to the max. The result is that the first few beats of ""Carol Lynn"" smack your eardrums with concussive force if you're wearing headphones. Painful. Perhaps a class action suit is in order. (-'You can turn the volume back down using the Speaker icon in the Windows system tray, but the interface will crank it back up each time you restart the disc. Be careful."
5,drunk on whiskeytown,"kids, you fence-sitting 4-4.5 stars types................are YOU MAD? this recording is brilliant.errrr, ummm.....have you heard THE JAYHAWKS, Rainy Day Music??? well, this recording is up there with those guys.see, the problem with people to spend more than 5 mins writing a review is that!!!! they have more than 5 mins to waste - ie: not constructive creating their own wonders. Whiskeytown, this is the record I play my wife. this is love!!!"
2,VERY FRUSTRATING TOY!,"My daughter received this for her 6th birthday. She loves Polly Pocket and was excited about the gift. However, the clothes are impossible to take on and off, certainly for children, but also for adults. At least three different adults have attempted to help my daughter change Polly's clothes, only to have the tight rubber-like clothes tear. My daughter no longer plays with this because it is just too frustrating. Additionally, if you have very young children in the house, there are LOTS of small parts to swallow."
4,it works good enough!,"It took overnight to charge the battery, but seems to work well.Did not come with instructions and the lights were no indication, but once again, it worked fine and it a good price."
5,Fast service,"arrived when expected and no problems using the charger. nice color and power light has a nice glow too, thanks"
1,Warning Serious Design Flaw Can Cause Injury,"When I received this skillet as a gift, I thought the glass cover that doubled as a casserole dish was a great idea. Unfortunately, there is no way for steam to escape while you cook with the lid on until you lift it up. The only way to lift it is by the sides -- two glass lips on the edge of the lid. Unless you are wearing two oven mitts that fully cover your hands, you run the risk of getting seriously burned by the escaping steam. I have a fairly serious burn from lifting the lid using hot pads. I even lifted the lid slightly with a fork to allow the steam to escape before I grasped it with the hot pads -- unfortunately it was not enough to prevent the injury. If you purchase this item, I would recommend using it without the lid."
1,Burned more than once!,"I own this fry pan. I am looking for a new one. This one is hard to use. The glass top has glass handles on the sides of the lid. When the pan is hot the lid and handles are very hot. You have to use pot holders on each side of the lid to lift it off. Steam escapes as you lift it off, and you rarely escape getting burned. I would give it no stars if that was an option."
2,Consult the burn unit at your local hospital,"The skillet itself is fine, the nonstick does a good job and clean up is easy. The glass cover, however, is a serious oversight in design. Though its a novel idea, being able to serve or microwave/conventional oven heat in the cover, there is simply no way to safely lift the cover from the skillet. The manufacturer should have designed a knob on the top of the cover rather than the two narrow and burning hot ""lips"" that barely protrude from the sides. There are safer choices!"
4,NOT THE GREATEST RECORDING,"This is however, the benchmark for those unaquainted with this most powerful of works. Bernstein simply lacks the passion and white fire here. He is not shockingly abrasive like Kondrashin and Barshai (the latter even added extra timpani and a bass drum to the closing notes) nor is there a relentless drive accosted at the price of subtlties (Rostropovich). The recording is sleak , like Haitink but the bassist lacks the histrionics that Make this piece all the more frightening. Not definitve by far."
2,The Spell of the Death Bed,"Death Bed, the bed that eats is one of the weirdest cult films ever made.Set near an estate- Three girls arrive at this little stone building. There is a guy hiding inside the walls and a bed that eats food, flowers, people and other things.. This guy in the wall and the bed have some sort of psychic connection. Whoever comes into contact with the bed gets eaten and it had some funny scenes but for the most part it sucked.'Comedy and Horror, art and artless, mundane and insane- death bed draws on the energies lost to more sensible films...This movie was super low budget. It was like someone just took a regular camcorder and and started filming. Most of it was boring except for the parts were the bed begins to eat things. It was some part fairytale/horror. It was definitely original but some of the scenes were just too stupid to take seriously. Prepare yourself for the strangest bedtime story ever told. The story of the Death Bed. Didnt like it."
3,Mediocre.,Actually I got a bigger kick from watching the TV-series. The book is just flat and predictable.
3,Audio quality disappointing,"Good concert, the the audio was a little flat. Disappointing for a Blu Ray with a DTS HD Master Audio. Video quality was good."
3,Low quality but cheap,"It looks like it cost, I bought it because I need the serial port on the front"
4,works great!,paired with netgear mr814 wireless router. works smoothly in a crowded apartment building.
2,Card does not work,"I had a lot of trouble with my Netgear wireless card. The drivers did not install on two laptops and the configuration utility says it cannot communicate with the driver, even though the driver seems to be properly installed and working.So back goes the product to [store](if I can figure that out). The technical support was responsive but were not able to help out with the problem (hence the two stars)"
4,Works perfectly ...!,"I am using both the netgear MA401 card and the cisco aironet 350 series card as i'm running a few laptops at the same time. while the cisco card gives better utilities and looks a lot better, it is more than twice the price of the netgear.If you are gonna get a netgear or any other router for home or small office use, i would strongly recommend this card. Installation was fuss free and took just around 5mins to link with my netgear router."
1,"About this card, it's from the same manufactory as Linksys","Well, this card and Linksys's 802.11b wireless PC card are the same. They all got poor reception and the card is even worst than Linksys. For University's wireless zone, it couldn't establish the connection and it even connects, it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting all the time... Same as Linksys, but Linksys got a little bit stablility and not quite stable... I would recommend to buy Oninoco's Silver/Gold card(Agree, a Division from Lucent) or Siemen SpeedStream Wireless Card. Because of Linksys and Netgear Wireless, they waste my time to return. I tried many times and brought them to University Computing Center to let technician help me out for setup. They said both cards are not good and they are all from the same manufactory."
4,Good Wireless Card,"I installed this on my kids Toshiba Satellite laptop, and even though it (the laptop) runs XP, I had no trouble connecting to my router (Netgear MR-814). The signal strength is not as good as the MA-101 (also easy to install), which is in the next bedroom, on an I-Paq running 98SE, but it has not disconnected or caused any problems that other reviewers have had. I think the signal strength to the router might be better if I re-located it (the router) away from the entertainment center downstairs, but other than that, it installed the first time, and has performed without any problems."
5,Works like a charm,"Plugged it into my Win XP Pro laptop, inserted the CD, and two minutes later, I'm connected. Nothing to it, no problems."
1,fake,"After downloading the driver twice for this wireless card, it just wouldn't work. I called Netgear and when I gave them the serial # they told me that it didn't exist in their files and was probably a fake!"
4,Work fine but not-so-far range,"I use it for my college wireless network. It works just fine without any trouble on my WinXP laptop. However, I can't use it somewhere Orinoco card could work. The advertised range is not reliable since the spot that I can't get it to work is definitely not far over the advertised indoor range."
2,"Works good, but other products are better.","This product does work well. When I got mine, the install software did not work on my computer. But, a newer version is out now that works fine. I have used other brands of this kind of card and they got much better reception than this card. I'm a big fan of Netgear products, but this is something I wish I had bought from another company."
2,Not something I'd recommend,"""The Blooding"" by Patricia Windsor starts out fine. Maris is a teenager who wants to escape her mother, and when a chance to be an au pair in England pops up, she takes it. She soon finds out that all is not what it appears to be. This is a depressing book, and includes suicide. The mother of the children seems ignored and put down by her husband. The father shows way more interest in Maris then he should. (And out of nowhere she returns that interest.) He 'bloods' her- making her a wolf like him.It goes downhill from there and this story does not end happily. I would NOT recommend this book."
3,It was good... sort of.,"The Blooding is an interesting book, although sometimes it's little else. The story is interesting but a little jerky sometimes. The writing style got to me a little. I don't really know why, but I think it was kind of the attempt (it seemed to me) to combine 3rd and 1st person. I read it on a very long bus ride, so I had little better to do. Besides, the plot did manage to progress fast enough to keep me interested. The opening immediately applies a sort of creepy feel to the text. It's good, but probably not something I'd read twice."
4,pretty awesome book!,"I have to admit, this book was really good. I have also read 'blood and chocolate' and although it wasn't quite as good as b&c, it wasn't supposed to be. It had a completely different plot, and the style was also nowhere near the same. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Oh Toby....,I'm one of Toby's biggest fans but...I have to say that this is the second disappointment in a row. It lacks the passionate ballads and get 'r done attitude that we have all grown to love with Toby. Very disappointing!
4,Awesome Performer,"Toby just finished playing for me and some of my fellow soldiers of the 101st Airborne, over in Iraq. Toby Keith's support for us has been awesome. I have come to enjoy his music from his performances, since I could not even tell you who he was before I enlisted. This album is yet another good one. No performer is going to churn out perfection and songs that hit everyone every time, but Toby Keith still has a good mix to reach everyone."
1,It takes a stupid man to have a stupid fan,"Proving once again that talent is not a requirement to appeal to the most uneducated, bigotted segment of the country fan base. Ignorant isn't just cool with Keith's fans, it's the standard of achievement - and they're proud of it! YEEEE-ha!A total loser playing for all the other losers who will pay anything to feel associated with a ""Grite Mercan"". Little do they suspect that Keith would go brokeback, Dixie Chick or whatever trend he could if it would make him more money."
5,White Trash With Money,"I just love the new White Trash With Money album. I love the variety of songs and the variety of timbre in his voice. I love the humor in ""Brand New Bow"" and I love message of ""Ain't No Right Way"" to do the wrong thing. I can't get enough of this album so I have it playing full blast 24/7. It's hard to pick a favorite song, I love them all! A must have.TKIFC - ""mrsnjband"""
5,LOVE IT !!!! Another GREAT CD by Toby Keith,"The whole family LOVES this CD! Toby Keith is so connected to the life of everyday people, he has not gotten caught up in his sucess to forget us everyday people who break their back to make a living. We LOVED seeing Toby live in concert this past January in Salt Lake City. My little son just LOVES all his music!Don't ever change Toby! TKIFC HBGB"
2,Dissapointed,"I was a huge fan of Toby Keith; before this album came out. I can accept the constant reference to an artist's idea of a perfect woman. But ""Runnin Block"" was downright dissappointing. If that's how Toby feels about imperfect women; I just can't enjoy his songs without thinking how shallow and insensitive he is."
5,"Love this, laughed, smiled, touched my heart!!!!","Finally had some quiet alone time to listen to the CD.I pre ordered and got it first day.Today I listened to it while at Lacrosse practice three timesin my truck. It made me smile, it made me laugh and really moved me with certain songs. Honestly at first I was drawn to the rough and rowdy get drunk and be somebody, I just love that upbeat flyin high song style, but when you move on to the rest of the CD you can see Toby and hear his thoughts and words. He puts to music what we feel and go through!!!BUY THIS CD... you won't be disappointed, he will get you the way he always does, it's there and it's better than good!Thanks Toby for making me SMILE! :)"
1,Another fiasco,I gave it one star because it is just not possible to give less.Toby Keith goes from bad to worse. I cannot buy his music even if they paid me to do such.
3,"Oh, come on people....do the research.","I agree with a number of the responses here about the spectrum of information and OPINION in this book. The sad thing is that everything is made so generic and stereotyped. There are good and bad examples of most all business models and distribution methods. MLM, Networks Marketing has had more than many others since it is so open to ""everyman"" to get involved. There are bad examples at the corporate level too - obviously Amway comes to mind as do the many ""businesses"" that became illegal pyramid schemes. But that's not it!Network Marketing is, in fact, taught in some business schools now (marketing). Check out the presentation at ""Brilliant Money"" web site.Yeah - the name sounds ""typical"", but it is a good review by Tim Sales and University of Illinois at Chicago Professor of Marketing - Dr. Charles King."
3,Erase the MIles,"This is a good cd but I did not realize that it was a combination of Grandpa,s Mandolin and IIIrd Tyme Out. The quality is great and I really enjoy this group, but I bought all of these cds and I didn't need this one."
4,Simple,"My video card only had dvi out, but i needed to hook it up to a monitor that was only vga... this dvi to vga is simple and straightforward. Is works as intended."
1,Did not work with my motherboard's DVI-I output,"I have an Intel DH67GD motherboard which has a DVI-I output. This adapter would not output a signal to a Samsung T240HD monitor. All I get could ever get was a blank (black) display. I was hoping it would work with my motherboard, but I kind-of expected it not to work. In the past, on other computers, I found that unless the manufacturer includes an adapter as part of the included accessories, the chances that a third party adapter would work is pretty slim.I was sort of surprised this did not work since it should have been compatible with all DVI specificiations (e.g. Single/Dual Link DVI-D and single/dual link DVI-I).Update 9/11/2011: My display, Samsung T240HD, has a DVI-D port. This adapter is a DVI-I. DVI-I and DVI-D are incompatible. The item description does indicate which your buying. But, let it be known, the adapter being shipped is a DVI-I."
5,Works as advertised . Great price!,See the headline. These are connectors. They work connecting my monitor to my computer. What else is there to say?
1,Failed in 3 months,"This adapter was an amazing price but it only lasted 3 months. My screen started to go blue intermittently. I tried to re-seat the adapter and cleaned the contacts, no help.You get what you pay for, buyer beware, this is a very poor quality adapter!"
5,Worked as promised,"Ordered it to try adding a second vga monitor to my pc's Radeon HD 4550 graphics card's DVI-I port. During the short day or two I tested it I was impressed with how well the set up worked with Ubuntu Linux 12.04. Decided against the second monitor due to shortage of desk space, additional wires and additional power draw on an already crowded outlet. The experience was well worth the investment."
1,Wrong connector sent...,"The picture indicates a DVI-I Dual Link connector. CE Compass sent a DVI-D Dual Link connector. Don't waste your time with these clowns, unless you like your orders to be crapshoots... Not knowing what you're gonna get."
1,Video card,"The card was dead on arrival. though the return process was simple, i would have liked a working card. will look for an alternative some place else"
1,Just flat doesn't work!,"Never could get this adapter to work! Have used other brands of adapters with no problems, but this one just flat wouldn't work."
4,Long John Daly,"This book is about one of the longest hitters on the PGA Tour. This book deals with his personal life and professional Golf. As a fan I am glad John has sought treatment for his many problems. As they say in life ""You learn as you go"" John has certainly learned his lessons in life unsuccessful marraige and drinking problems. This is a must have book for Golf fans and John Daly fans."
2,Unreliable & Annoying,"My mother purchased this for my son for his first birthday. We have found it really annoying: it only seems to play one song after about a month... Sounds like this is a common problem, although not with te same song as everyone else.It has barely lasted a few months, though. The computer in it is glitchy, and it seems to get ""stuck"" the same way records could. He still plays with the shapes and wheels and doesn't mind that the music doesn't work, but it sure was an expensive push toy.I don't plan on buying another VTech product after this one."
1,The winner in my house for the WORST TOY EVER,"Honestly, this is a TERRIBLE toy. I can't even give it away...I wouldn't want to frustrate anyone else.The shapes don't pop in well. The toy sings the same song over and over again, and for no apparent reason (as others have mentioned). The song lyrics are ""sort sort sort my shapes"" but I swear it sounds like ""eat eat eat my shorts"". I had no idea what the thing was saying. The voices are horrible. The sounds are horrible. The music is horrible.Did I say this toy is horrible? No, I think I said this toy is terrible. Well, it's horrible too!"
5,Life Saver,"My son's doctor has one of these in his waiting room, and my son must play with this whenever he's there because it helps keep him distracted and calm. I went to all the local toy stores trying to find it until I gave up and ordered in from amazon. My son particularly loves the songs, and is really surprised that I know them and am able to sing along with it. Great educational toy for toddlers."
1,Crazy Legs Learning Bugs,"The one that I received was not as the picture showed. I wanted the Crazy legs that had the cords attached to the pieces so they would not get lost. I could have found the one they sent at any store. Also, it cost more to ship it back than it was worth. So disappointed."
1,Not a good product! And a big waste of money!!,"I bought this toy brand new. It was missing the pull along cord. The toy also the shapes dont fit properly in the slots so when you hit the release button half of them are stuck and wont pop out and it also very annoying it sings the same thing over and over ...""sort sort sort machine""... i would return it but it isnt worth the headache. But i do not recommend this product its cheaply made."
2,crazy legs... or just plain crazy?,"This may be a better toy for the older groups. I got this toy for my 8 month old for Christmas and she had very litte interest in it, only wanting to push the very top button that does not do what one might expect (woops!). Now she is 16 months and has started pulling it behind her and pushing the lighted buttons but still will not follow the game and therefore... WOOPS! The toy seems durable, have not had to replace batteries. Parents beware, the toy is very annoying. Pull the string WOOPS... Push the wrong button WOOPS... And I've never said that about any toy ever! WOOPS! I would not recommend this to parents with younger children unless you are looking for something for your child to grow into."
5,Super manual,"I've not played a sax for decades and even forgot how to read music, but this book was terrific in getting me going again. I have book 2 also. I'm actually using it for a soprano sax, as they are the same key."
4,Real easy book to follow,"Great for beginers, theory included, This book comes with 2 cd's load on your computer to follow along, great applications to use with the book"
4,Worth the Money!,If you have already shelled out the money to become Nationally Board Certified then you will want to spend a little more to make sure you get it right the first time. I wish I had this book the first time around. The buzzwords are particularly helpful. The format of this book is a little easier to navigate than other NBPTS books. I found that it was worth the price.
4,a lesson on dialect,"""Sealie"" gives a lesson on writing in dialect. Her colorful turns of phrase and sometime odd grammatical use make funny spelling unneccessary while conveying in detail the voices of her home town. I bought this book after hearing Sheila read at Hindman, hoping it was not only her way of reading that made me want more. I wasn't disappointed. The stories -literally dozens of them- are anecdotal; vignettes, really, many from early childhood. All are about growing up in a place where Family and Home mean more than random accidental attachments; so much more. There aren't plots, no intrigue and resolution, but I laughed aloud in places and cried in others, and next time I see Sheila I need to ask about that little ""life's secrets revealed"" she got from Granny."
2,Egg poacher,"I gave it to my daughter and she gave it back, as she had trouble getting the water out and egg out. I then gave it to a grandson and haven't heard if he likes it or not. I myself had a really good microwave egg poacher that I have had for many years and really like it. You can dump out the water at one end and then just slide the lid forward and the eggs come right out. This is what I thought your egg poacher would be like. Not very useful."
4,"Wonderful holiday feature, possibly headed to classic!","We bought ANGEL DOLL after reading about it in a piece for the St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Memphis (the film has a connection to this facility). Our expectations were not high, but the film was quite a pleasant surprise. There are no big stars in the movie, but the performances are solid and believable. I've seen my share of similar plot-lines (i.e., poor kid or family overcomes hardships to appreciate the true meaning of Christmas or friendship or loyalty or whatever. But Angel Doll does not cross into hokeyville. It manages to remain true to its themes and entertaining to the viewer. For the price, it's a wonderful value for any video collection."
1,Don't buy this,These wrenches don't have the grove cut out inside the square drive hole. So there is no way for the extension bar to hold on to these wrenches. They will keep on dropping off the extension bar. Do you want to know what groves I am talking about? Move your mouse over the pic in the link below:[...]I would not buy from Sunex Tools again. This is a poorly designed tool. I am trying to return the ones I bought.
1,Clayson's writing stinks,"As a big fan of Roy Orbison I really looked forward reading this book. However, mr. Clayson's writing is selfcentered and this book is more about Clayson's taste of music and his views on the music scene, then it is about the Big O. Roy Orbison's tragic life - first wife killed in a motorbike accident and two children died in a fire - is being used as a background to Clayson's chit chat. A big dissapointment; a Big D for Clayson."
1,unbelievable rubbish,"After reading all users reviews, i find everything about this apalling book has been already said, and i just would like to give my humble advice to other people who, like me, is fanatic of the divine Big O's voice and music, and might want to buy it. This 'book' is confusing, pretentious, full of mistakes, and just plain ugly. I also would rather give it no star at all, so just ignore the one i was forced to use for this review.Eternal glory for Roy Orbison, simple oblivion for this very mediocre book."
5,Very nice; great performance and stability,"Nice unit; save yourself some time and download/install the latest Netgear drivers for both the AP and the MA402. The MA402 utils comes with a WEP passphrase option, but no go for the SNMP util. I downloaded the latest Linksys WAP11 SMNP utils which has this feature (look for it soon from Netgear). Very nice, using the passphrase I easily set up 128 bit WEP and am surfing from the sofa."
4,"great, except...","These trays fit the drawers perfectly in width but they still slide back when the drawers are opened, which continues to be annoying. It would be better if they had real grips on the bottom to prevent this from happening."
5,Perfect!,Fits snugly and has tons of space. Not much else to say... don't hesitate to buy one if your draw will fit it!
5,The Life of the Theatre,"The Living Theatre was and continues to be a radical theatre collective who approaches their art as a medium for social change and commentary. The Life of the Theare is a collection of Julian Beck's journals in the 1960s and early 70s. The book chronicles Beck's thoughts on theatre and social change as they intersect and diverge and as he struggles to make a theatre of meaning--theatre worthy of its participants and spectators.Contemporary readers will find some of the rhetoric a bit dated, but there is no doubt that the goals of Julian Beck and the Living Theatre remain as vital today as at the group's founding over 40 years ago. This book is a must read for all artists and activists alike."
5,Good quality item,"Super easy set up and take down. Compact and appears durable. Good to have the cloth ""pillowtop"" which is like a thin mattress pad. I would recommend this product."
4,This is a pretty good album,"If you're truly looking for some old and rare songs that can't be found in a cd store or the cd is not availaible, this album is the best choice. I have sampled all the songs there and liked most of them. However, I personally found some of the songs there cheesy (no names mentioned). I was glad I found this album and personally, I liked tracks: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 the best. Sadly, I think there should have been a few more tracks and more research done on the music, though it is already very good."
3,Okay,This product claims to in time lessen and lighten the hair where shaved. I have not found this to be true.
4,An excellent look at Rosie's past,"Those wanting to know a lot about Rosie O'Donnell's earlier work,especially her movies, will enjoy reading this look at her life. Parish has done a fairly complete look at her past, although it is lacking on some of the more recent work like her show, and her online activites.The writing is excellent, and was an easy read, but the author seems to use exclamation marks a few too many times for my taste...The book also lacks colour photographs of Rosie, but has an excellent picture of Rosie (from 1994 Academy Awards) on the cover.Fans of Rosie (like myself) who want to gain a better understanding of the context around which the ""Queen of Nice"" has become the multi-media phenomenon that she is should definitely pick up a copy of this book. I loved it!"
3,"C'mon now people, this is average at best","Following Countdown to Extinction, I thought that maybe Megadeth had become a decent band. I was wrong. This is still an alright album, but I don't know if I'd really spend my pizza delivering tips on it again. Listen to the samples, they are pretty representative of the entire songs, and make your own judgement based on them."
3,Surprisingly better than the original!!!,"I was bashing the remade versions of ""Peace Sells.. "" and ""So far so good..so what?"" and I haven't changed opinion about that, but I must say that this remastered version of Youthanasia is awesome. I already liked the album but now I feel it even more. Don't hesitate to buy this version if you already think that the original recording is good.It's worth it!*It should be 5 stars but I can't edit that."
2,Unacceptable,"This disc is unacceptable unless you like tracks that are incomplete. It is one thing to have excerpts and another to end the track only 10 measures from the actual ending of the piece! Buy a disc with reasonably complete pieces instead. I am not even ""filing"" this with my other classical CDs. (It will be filed somewhere else.)"
4,Good cable for the money,Replaced an existing KVM switch cable that had a few broken pins. This one seems much sturdier.
3,A Great Book if you want to be .....,"an admimisttative assistant or office manager. Lists, lists, and more lists of things you should have on hand and things you should to be efficient in a business office setting. Just not what I was looking for at all."
3,Insights lost in Maslow's ramblings.,"Without the commentary, you would be hard pressed to pick out Maslow's insights in this stream-of-conscience puffery.To save you the cost of this book, his main thesis is ""A musician must make music, and an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself. What a man can be, he must be. This need we may call self-actualization...It refers to a man's desire for self-fulfillment, namely to the tendency for him to become in actuality what he is potentially:to become everything that one is capable of becoming"""
3,hmmm...,"While the Opteka remote does what it is indented to do, it does not fit snug into the cameras shutter release input slot. There is a rubber guard covering the hole, and it seems this is getting in the way. This problem often causes the release to fall off the camera, and when shooting at night time, can be a big problem. However, on the positive side the thing works, and costs a fraction of Sony's release."
5,Another Winner From Pastor Alcorn,"I read The Grace and Truth Paradox at the end of 2004, but I chose to pick it up again due to a Changes That Heal study that my wife and I were a part of. This little book will take you maybe 1 1/2 hours to read and has lots of little stories with powerful messages behind them. I really like the book and give it an A+. Here is a memorable quote, ""It's not about earrings, tattoos, clothing, drinking wine, or smoking cigars. It's about justice, righteousness, love, and mercy. It's about grace and truth."" I like that line. I also want to recommend Alcorn's Heaven book."
3,Patrick and Dakota....and poor Abigail.,"I really liked the story, it was very witty and interesting. However, the way Patrick treated Abigail, who was about 6 years old, was unforgivable. Her entire young life was miserable. Patrick hurt this child's feelings constantly. Each time she hugged him, he didn't hug her back. He often called her out for what she did or didn't do, very unkindly and she would tremble and cry. Patrick couldn't love her because she wasn't his - this wasn't a secret in the book - but who doesn't like a little kid? I wouldn't want to marry a man who was that cold and mean to a child. As if it was her fault she wasn't his. What a dope."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought one of these on February 10th. It has a 60-day warranty. On April 8th it started leaking out of the seam above the heating element. I have only used it to heat water for tea, coffee, etc and never let it go dry.The previous WestBend pots I have had (different models) lasted about a year and then had to be replaced, which meant that I was buying a new one each year (excessive).But this latest model's new twist of a 60 day lifespan is too much. And to return it you have to mail it to WestBend, pay for the shipping and insurance -- which is half the cost of the item.I guess it's a great racket, if you can sucker enough people into buying it.My recommendation -- Don't waste your money!"
4,It's useful but...,"It's a little bit complicate to use, but when you learn how to use, it really helps."
4,entering into one's psyche,"I first listened to Kaddish when it was released as an Lp and I'm certain I was in an altered state. I really can't remember how it affected me then but it did so that I wanted to listen to it again.The poem is an opening into Ginsberg's own psyche - what made him the way he is is - but it is also an opening into my own . As you listen to his journey, you can't help but reflect on your own.Listening to Kaddish is not easy but then neither was his life. There is a reward in listening to it but I can't describe what it is - maybe you just have to listen for yourself.However, what I heard the second time around (now in my 60s) was different than when I first heard it: I understood it far more looking back."
1,Incompatible with XP,Be warned! You may think that wireless LAN is something pretty up to date and that you will be able to use a pretty standard PCI adapter with XP. You can't. The XP compatbility wizard managed to find this card and announce its incompatibility. And this is despite there being an XP drivers folder on the CD.The version I've got doesn't even run under 2000.AVOID
1,Error in song titles,"A friend loves the big band music and wanted this one as it listed having some of the songs he wanted. Unfortunately, the description listed on your site was not the same as the songs on the CD. Thankfully, the person I spoke to at your customer service dept., saw it was so and let me return it. I am grateful that you stand behind your product and make sure your customers are satisfied."
1,"Amazon did a switch of product and are not as described, neither cables work!",The cables which I received do not match the picture. The picture has them as gray with an insignia. The cables which I received are black and have no markings. Great going Amazon I have two cables and neither of them work!
5,it works,plugged it in to my 9600gt and ran it to my monitor worked great haven't had one issue looked cooler than i thought it would no regrets at all
5,Beautiful bowl!,"I purchased this item for someone else, but wanted to keep it for myself! Really pretty."
1,enjoy it while it lasts,"my husband loves this particular machine and uses it several times per week if not a few times per day.we go through a couple of these a year. they just don't hold up at ALL. we've ignored it when the bar fails and it still works fine. the real issue seems to be that the popping oil leaks into the base and kills the heating element.the upside to replacing so frequently is that the appearance of the unit does not wear well. it starts looking icky pretty quick unless you want to spend a lot of time on careful handwashing and drying (unless you run your dishwasher a few times a day).and it's too big to stick in a cabinet, so I'm looking at its ugly oily mug sitting on the counter all the time. so in that respect, monthly replacements are (literally) more attractive."
1,Not safe.,"The nonstick coating scratches, and the plastic bowl melted around the edges. The more I use it, the less kernels get popped. I plan on buying cheap pans to use, so I won't mind recycling them when they get burnt. At least I won't be ingesting toxins.Update: Now the bowl is cracked. I expected this to last more than 3 months. I bought a stainless steel pan just for pop corn. Safer and easier."
3,"fun, makes good popcorn","but I have not experienced the near nirvana that the other reviewers have. Really great if you have children, it is entertaining. Maybe the popcorn is better then in a pot, I dunno. The butter dispener is cool and it does pop all the kernels. The trade of is your paying extra for those items, a pretty good amount extra, for what you can almost accomplish in a pot (can't see the kernels popping mad there though!)"
1,A terrible poper,"I was impressed by the description of this popper when I ordered it. My opinion dramatically changed after the first use.The rod that stirs the corn keeps falling of causing problems with popping. The little black bowl cover will not stay on when serving the popcorn.Never,never buy a popper that cant be cleaned in your dishwasher.I would throw it out but I have to much invested."
3,Great Popcorn But Watch for Leaking,"Everything about this popper is great; but a big problem is that the lid does not fit tightly. I used butter as instructed, fastened the lid to the top and flipped the corn into the top. The butter leaked through the top and onto my clothes leaving a large grease stain."
1,Product Alert,"These are now made in China so the quality of the materials is like there baby formula not so good.The first one of these I owned lasted for three years, and the second one six months.The last one I purchased lasted a week.We have actually moved away from purchasing this Item all together."
1,popper,"i was not satisfied with this product, it left way to many unpooped kernels in bottom of popper, would not recomend"
2,"Just a great popper, but--","Isn't there always a ""BUT""? We eat just a lot of popcorn in our house, I would guess that the popper is the most used appliance we own and we have owned several of these poppers. It makes great popcorn, is easy to set up and clean up, BUT, on every one of them the bowl top has become brittle and has deformed to the point that it is no longer functional. Our current edition, after about 6 months has warped to the point that un-popped kernels will shoot out the side under the bowl as the popper is doing its thing. If you only make popcorn now and then, this popper will probably last for several years, ""BUT."" It is too bad that this defect, which certainly has been common to the six or eight West Bends that we have owned in the last several years, isn't fixed with a more durable bowl. Until it is we won't be purchasing another."
4,Fun Poppin',"We were using a hand-cranked popper and this is easy to use and fun for the kids to watch as they can see the corn pop ""right before their eyes"". We've only used it with regular butter, but it came out great."
5,I Need a New Butter Cap!,"I absolutely love my Stir Crazy popper. This is my second one in 25 years. However, my husband accidentally threw away the plastic cap. I've checked around online, and a replacement is going to cost $10 -$15 with shipping! I just can't see paying that much for a cheap little plastic cap. I wish West Bend made the cap a bright red or yellow and imprinted ""Do Not Discard"" on both sides of the cap (for those who are pop-corn-popper challenged). An extra cap included would also have been nice. If anyone has any ideas (or extra caps) please post. Thanks!"
2,I don't like it.,"I don't care for this popper. It is ok with popping the corn. However, I have to stand by and babysit it because as soon as it stops popping, it quickly needs to be turned over so that the popcorn doesn't burn.I would rather have one of the ""old fashioned"" air poppers."
2,Good Idea Gone Bad,"I bought this item as a Christmas present to myself. I was so excited to use it. It took way too long to start popping and the kernels did not produce the big fluffy popcorn I was expecting. When I used the ""butter well"" located at the top of the unit, this caused moisture to condensate inside the popper and much of the popcorn ended up wet. I was checking online to see if anyone else had experienced this problem when I found out about the flaking teflon. I tried to head-off the problem by slightly bending the stirrers but after less than five uses, there are scratches in the teflon. Now, I'm scared to use it."
4,Popcorn that taste like you are at the Movies!!,"Okay I got this popcorn maker at TARGET and wanted to beat the taste of microwave popcorn that sticks in your throat and taste awful.I started searching on the web thru reviews at Amazon , etc. and ran out to buy this maker. At first I used the popcorn and oil that target sold and tried adding the melted butter thru the lid while it was making....but it still did not taste AWESOME....soooooo we ordered the 4oz. gold mega popcorn kits (36 kits in a box) (below) at Sam's Club and just made our first bowl....all you need is the kit and it TASTE LIKE POPCORN FROM THE MOVIES... you do not need to add anything....makes a complete bowl full - do not get the 6 oz. size you need the 4 oz. Do not get another brand. This is it!! enjoy!!![...]."
2,no luck with this popcorn popper,"I don't know if they've changes these but the last two of these popcorn poppers didn't last long, maybe a couple of months at the most. They just stopped working. Never again. I'll get a stove top popcorn popper now. I tried using a pot but it burned the pot on the bottom."
2,Works well but tastes terrible,"I love popcorn and was hopeful that the Stir Crazy would forever put an end to microwave popcorn. Unfortunately, I'm back to zapping corn. The machine works fine despite some scraping of the teflon surface and it pops almost all of the corn. But the taste of the popcorn is just awful. It's chewy and mushy and the kernels don't seem like they're fully popped. It's nothing like the crisp popcorn you get at the theatre or from your stovetop or even from your microwave. I've tried different types of popcorn and different oils but still get the same nasty results. I'm going to buy a Stovetop popper and see if that provides the classic popcorn taste I'm looking for. Who wants Teflon in their popcorn anyway?"
2,hard to clean,"This popper is okay, but I'm suprised more people don't complain about cleaning it! The heating plate can't be removed and I worry about water getting into the electrical components below. The bowl does not come clean easily and has acquired a sticky film even though I immediately clean it when it is done popping - after transferring the popcorn to another bowl. The shape of the dome/bowl is not good for releasing the steam that collects, so if you make a full bowl of popcorn, it's a bit chewy. If you use the tray on the top to melt butter onto your popcorn, then the butter leaks out of the black cover on the bowl and stains your couch! It takes up too much room on the counter, it won't fit in my 1950's cabinets, it's difficult to clean, the bowl doesn't hold the butter, and the popcorn isn't that great. I'm looking for a glass bowl on my next popper."
5,Couldn't live without!,I'm now on my second popper. My first one I bought for my dorm roon in college 20 years ago. The only reason I replaced it was because I wanted one that was a little cleaner (it didn't get washed very well in a dorm room). I use a little Orville Redenbacher's butter flavored oil and popcorn salt. My family says I make the best popcorn and I certainly love it.
1,Why would you risk your health ingesting teflon?,"This item is a health hazard. The fact that the company is still allowed to sell these after all these years is an insult to conscious consumers everywhere. God only knows how many people have suffered or even died from ingesting flakes of hazardous Chinese teflon, but one thing is for certain, teflon, no matter where it comes from is not organic and it doesn't dissipate in your body. We are already exposed to enough cancer causing substances and foods. I'd pass on this potential for yet another."
2,Ordered Twice -- Both Poppers Arrived Broken,"I was very interested in having popcorn without all of the chemical additives in microwave products. Difficult task???? Apparently so. I ordered this product twice, both times Amazon sent it without padding and the plastic base of the popper was broken. Stove top models cannot be used on a smooth ceramic cooktop. That leaves me one option: I am going to go back to using my old hot air popper and dodge the kernels that pop all over the place. Who would have thought making popcorn the old-fashioned way would be such a pain??????"
3,This poppers not to smart.,"West Bend promised this would be a good popper, no sticking, no burning, not worries. For the most part this was true. The heating element does stay on as long as the poppers plugged in though so you can't leave this attended by little ones on all on its own. You have to watch the popcorn the whole time it pops and then pull the plug when you feel it's done. The other bad part is that it's a rather big unit so unless you eat popcorn daily and want to store it on your counter, it might be hard to store. It does pop the kernals evenly and pretty much spread the butter throughout though. Not bad for a middle of the road popper but if you're going to stand there the whole time anyway you might as well use a little bit of butter and a big cooking pot, same amount of clean up, time spent and you don't to find extra space in your cuboard. Also, this popper dosn't work to well on ""air only"", you really nead to ad a bit of butter or oil to make it work right."
4,Wonderful Popper,"We love our popcorn popper. The clear dome lets the kids watch the kernels burst into fluffy corn, which is very fun. The best part is that the arm mechanism is very effective at keeping the popcorn from burning. Very affordable. The only thing I wish is that there was a safer, easier way to get the popped corn out of the popper. Flipping it over is a little tricky because of the steam and warm base. Overall though, we think it's the best popcorn popper on the market and a great deal."
1,Fragile!!,"This thing made (notice the past tense) great popcorn. After barely 6 weeks, one handle broke off the base unit. Two weeks later, the other handle broke off. There were no apparent cracks in the base. Needless to say, it was then unusable and since I'd had it for a couple of months, unreturnable. It's now in the trash, just one more thing in landfill that shouldn't have had to go I've thought of buying another, but won't waste more money. I'll go to an air popper."
5,Great Popper!,"Not much to say but what I will say is that is works great so far! Practically every kernel pops. Popcorn tastes great. I only use Orville Redenbacher's gourmet popping corn though! Thanks, West Bend!"
2,Teflon and Metal Stirring Rod is a Bad Combination - Scratching,"We were very excited when we first bought it. It was fun to watch the popcorn on our 1st use. On our 2nd use of this popcorn popper, the teflon surface was scratched badly by the stirring rod with a kernel. Since it's not good to eat teflon, we are no longer going to use it. We will start cooking popcorn on the stove in a pot. It tastes the same and it's easier to clean the pot than this popcorn popper."
3,Fun but not so tasty.,"Purchased for grandchildren. They love watching it pop so it's entertaining. But, sad to say because I'm no longer using a microwave, the result isn't as tasty as microwave popcorn : ( Tastes dry (even with adding the suggested amount of butter to melt over the corn as it cooks) and tends to burn."
5,The Best way to prepare popcorn,"I'm not a microwave popcorn fan. Cooking in hot oil is really the best way to get the ""movie theater"" taste! I like to use Orville Redenbacher WHITE popping corn with the Orville's oil. Somehow cooking in Wesson just isn't the same. That way you only need a little bit of butter and salt to enhance the experience. Yes, it's oil based so it's not dry like hot air, but that's the whole point. Yes, hot air is easier, but if it's the TASTE you're looking for, there's nothing better than this system. BTW, I was skeptical that the stirring gizmo would last. But it has and it's really ingenious because all the kernels pop. Great job WB!"
5,Best Popper Ever!,My daughter received one of these as a gift a few years ago and has always raved about how good it pops the corn and how good the flavor of the popped corn is. I finally decided to try one after hearing all the negatives about microwave popcorn. We really love this popper! It is very easy to use and to clean up and fun to watch while in action. I ordered two more that are all wrapped and ready to give as Christmas gifts to other family members.
2,Great product but very bad quality and customer service,Received two units within one month. First one stopped working after one use. They sent me a replacement and it came chipped. Customer service wouldn't send a replacement until I sent in mine so they could examine it and then determine if I was telling the truth. They lost a customer on their product and I told them so.
1,Burned out,I bought two of these poppers in the last 4 years. The heating element burned out on each of them. The popper makes great popcorn but the planned demise built into these poppers is not worth the cost.Madfro
4,Love this!,No air-popper will ever compare to this unit. The non-stick surface works perfectly and the rotating arm adds just the right amount of movement to evenly pop the corn. This unit make light fluffy corn (of any brand). I highly recommend this unit.
4,Thought provoking - a bit heavy,"Not only a great introduction to Rand's ideas but just good, thoughtful, reading. The ""Open Letter to Boris Spasky"" is worth the price of the book. The writing tends to be a bit plodding (like most philosophy) but the ideas are deep and clearly stated."
4,"Some Good, Some Bad!",I guess in this book you can see both the good qualities of Ayn Rand as well as some of her non-desirable traits. Good gateway book before tackling on the big and long Atlas Shrugged.
5,"excellent, inspiring essays","The title essay was originally a speech given at West Point, and one of Miss Rand's own favorite pieces. In it, she eloquently demonstrates the importance of philosophy in man's life... in EVERY man's life. ""...the choice we make is not whether to have a philosophy, but which one to have: rational, conscious, and therefore practical; or contradictory, unidentified, and therefore lethal."" This book is for those interested in philosophy, as well as for those who aren't.As Leonard Peikoff states in the Introduction, ""Ayn Rand was not only a novelist and a philosopher; she was also a salesman of philosophy -- the greatest salesman philosophy has ever had."" Philosophy's purpose is not to impress people at cocktail parties or to ""trick"" people in debates with ready-to-wear paradoxes. Philosophy is essential to life -- read this book to discover why."
1,MISREPRESENTED,This is not a movie. How many people have to buy this mistaking it for a movie before Amazon or the seller does the moral thing and make the distinction for its buyers?
1,SHAME on Amazon,"Riders of the Purple SageSHAME SHAME SHAME on you, Amazon. This is not a movie, this is not an audio book. It is a text version of the book - for $10.00! It is not described accurately.Read the reviews and fine print very carefully folks, somebody is out to hose you.Very disappointed."
3,Typical Bernstein and atyical Bernstein,"This CD is a split decision in my view -- half typical Bernstein, half very unBernstein. Tchaikovsky's ""Winter Dreams"" symphony gets a sympathetic echt-Bernstein reading, which is to say powerfully done, emotionally involved with some excess. The ""Little Russian"" symphony is very unlike Bernstein -- fast, uninvolved, unfussy. Even boring. I found myself enjoying the 1st symphony more each time I heard it, allowing myself to get used to Lenny's heaving excesses. That 2nd symphony, however...I wonder if that was really Bernstein that recorded this? Maybe Lorin Maazel snuck in and dressed up like Lennie for that session. Irregardless of the verdict on this, the sound on this CD is very impressive and plays into Bernstein's excess very well. Fans of the maestro will probably like this. Fans of Tchaikovsky will probably like the first symphony, the second less so."
1,A confused mind? or a Cunning Person?,"I would have given a zero star if Amazon had such rating.The World Today Tomorrow pretends to be democratic, but in truth, nearly 200 pages discusses so called 'conspiracy theories.' The book is a misleading trash of hate literatue, if it could be called 'literature' at all.Mathe copied extensively from Illuminati, The Lerned Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other spinmasters of hate literature.I was mislead by Mathe's self-description of his book as a thesis on direct democracy--my biggest mistake to have bought ""his out of body experiences"" that seem to have suggested to him sheer hate literature.George Sagi, one of the founders of Worldwide Direct Democracy Movement, WDDM."
4,Eforcity Red SportBand for Apple iPod nano 4G,"the only reason why I am not giving this item 5 stars it's only because it's too tight for my Ipod Nano 4G, yet have to be fair: my baby has a Speck ToughSkin for iPod nano 4G, therefore it adds thickness to the device so that's probably why it won't fit.the GREAT part of all this is that the Speck ToughSkin has a rotating clip, so what I do is, hook the Clip in the compartment (built for the Ipod) of the Sportband, so even though the Ipod is outside of it, it's clipped to it, and I'm able to change the music or whatever i want to do.oh, well something potential buyers should know is, if you put the Ipod inside the case of the sports band, you won't be able to access the anything but the headphones port. / also you'd have to insert the Ipod upside down:Si suppose it works for me just fine, because i use it with a clip on.not as practical as it should be, considering it's a sports band, so this item probably deserves 3stars:S"
2,Needlessly obtuse,"I have encountered few graduate texts so carelessly written. Often the concepts seem contradictory until the student re-reads the section multiple times. Seems to be written by math whizzes for math whizzes and foregoes explanation or ""big picture"" tie-in when the concepts could really benefit from more attention. Sometimes the material seems ingested from external sources and not vetted with the rest of the material. For example, the end of the section on determining risk has two formulae that use 'epsilon,' each formula having a different definition of what that variable means. Stands largely on manipulation of theory/formulae assuming a perfectly efficient market; with that in mind, it's a good text on the theoretical underpinnings of some financial calculations and software, but ineffectively imparts knowledge on adaptation to 'real world' applications."
1,Simply junk! Expensive junk!,"I didn't buy 20-pack, but a small 10-pack. So far, all coasters. I tried 2 different softwares in two different ways: VIDEO_TS & AUDIO_TS with UltraIso, and (converted) ISO with DVDDecrypter. All bad burn, my versatile Philips DVD player (supposed to play it all!) can not read any. I'll stick with Memorex, cheaper, haven't failed me once yet (burned on 3 different PCs, with 3 different DVD-ROM brands!). I'll never buy anything by the brand Verbatim EVER again!"
1,I'll never use this!,Almost half of the total package was failed to burn on my Pioneer dvd+R writer.I didn't have any problem with Sony medias before.Don't even try this junk.
1,Not working with a Sony drive,"The first five of five disks failed with a Sony DRU-810A drive. They may be fine disks, but they don't work with my equipment. Switching back to Memorex disks solved the problem."
3,"7.96GB, not 8.5GB","Tried a few so far (with Nero) and it worked fine. The only negative thing noticed is that the size of the disk reported by both the operating system and the DVD recorder is 7.96G, not 8.5G as advertized."
5,Very Reliable,used 4 of these disks right of the bat. Did not a singual failure. Check them with Plextor test utility and found them to be of excelent quality.
5,High Quality Media,"20 discs and not a single coaster. I'm not sure what better a review I can give to blank optical media than that.For reference, my discs were burned using Toast 8 Titanium on a Intel Core Duo iMac Superdrive."
2,2 out of 3 Coasters so far. I am not impressed.,"I bought these discs after hearing about how great Verbatim discs were compared with other manufacturers. I had been using Memorex (and will be again) and had experienced 3 coasters out of 60 burns. Not bad at all. Anyhow, I saw the Verbatims on sale and picked up a 20 spindle. As the title of this review states, 2 of the 3 burns thus far have resulted in coasters. I am waiting on the 4th, but am not hopeful. I am going back to Memorex. I should have bought them as usual, but was lured by the sale on Verbatim($3 less, usually $5 more than the Memorex). There really is no excuse for this abhorrent level of quality control. Ummm...make that 3 out of 4. Utter crap even at 2x burn speed. Oh yeah, the one that did burn looks really nice. Then again, so do the Memorex. Buyer beware..."
2,"Verbatim Denies the ""up to 6x"" given for 96577 DVD+R DL","Amazon is incorrectly advertising this as being able to be burned higher than 2.4X. That speed is the highest that is officially given on the label of the 50-Disc Spindle (96577) that I received. Verbatim doesn't back any higher speeds.Otherwise, you risk getting coasters.From Verbatim when I contacted them:""Thank you for contacting Verbatim Technical Support. Unfortunately, 96577 is not compatible with 6x speed, you can burn these discs with a max speed of 2.4x, we request you to kindly visit (their website) and check for the right model discs.Your case no is: 000xxxxxIf you need any further assistance please call us on: (their phone number) and we will be happy to assist you.Regards,Verbatim Technical SupportSo I say Please Check out the Verbatim specs for 96577 at their website before you purchase this from Amazon."
2,These discs didn't work for me,"Most of the discs I have tried to burn either skipped, wouldn't burn, or wouldn't play. I think I got one that turned out where I could watch one full movie. I don't know if it's the double layer or what, but I am going back to single, with less capacity which have always worked fine for me."
4,Will this work on my Dell Studio One Desktop?,"Hi guys, I know this isnt a response but I was wondering if I could burn things to these CD's without needing to buy a special burner or player, on my Dell Studio One, Windows Vista Desktop (All in one). It also runs on Intel Pentium. Please reply as soon as possible. Thanks!"
1,reclamo no ha llegado la mercancia como hago,buenas noches todavia esperando los 100 dual layer que compre hace mas de 20 dias como haria para saber donde estan y si me las van hacer llegar o no gracias
1,Even Verbatim can fail,A whole stack of DVD+R DL blanks failed! I went through half of a 20 pack before realizing my copy problems weren't software or the burner. All of the movies would lock up 3/4 through. I switched to Memorex but I'm sure it was just a bad batch. It can happen with any disks.
1,poor,"when i recived the dvds they were not what i ordered i was told Amazon made a mistake on the web site, i had to call shoplet to actually recive my money after i returned the item, i am very disatisfied with shoplet i will not order from them agian. as for the dvd's bought this brand before and they worked with no problems."
4,Reliable media for a good price.,Great dual layer media that is extremely reliable even when slightly scratched. DVD+R DL is a better media choice than DVD-R DL because of the ability to set booktype with appropriate burner.
5,works great,About 20 disks and I haven't had any coasters or any problems with playback on any DVD Players including my Toshiba HDA2 HD-DVD player. Video quality is 1/1 to original as far as I can tell. burning using Nero on my Vista (64bit!) Core2duo PC with my $30 SATA DVD-DL burner (Lite-On).
4,Verbatims spotty quality now---,"The problem with verbatims now is that some are being outsourced to india...which is bad, they do not use the same manufacturing process and quality control program as the verbatims made in SINGAPORE! So if you want the good ol trusty verbatims we love so much make sure its manufactured in Singapore, also the media from Japan isnt bad. The verbatim printable DVD+R DL media (95123) is made exclusivly in singapore."
2,A Few Coasters,"I used the Memorex DVD+R DL DVDs before buying the Verbatim ones. Out of a Memorex 20-pack I didn't burn a single coaster using Nero. Out of the first 10 Verbatim discs, however, I've burned 3 coasters. One of the coasters was obvious, as you could see many imperfections in the disc right after I removed it from the cake box. The edges of all of the discs look ragged and cheap. I would not recommend this brand of dual layer DVDs and I won't buy them again."
5,just what i needed,these dl discs proved to be high quality. i have been using them for game backups with great success. no disc reading errors whatsoever. best buy sells half the amount of discs for double the price! amazon is for the more educated shopper :)
5,Good quality disks,"I don't know what the first reviewer is talking about, but the disks I received were made in singapore. I burned about 15 disks continuously and have not had 1 coaster. The burn time is a little slow but I'm worried more about the quality not the speed. I will continue to purchase Verbatim disks as long as they stay reliable."
5,Great,"Worked no problem time and again.Up to now, I have never gone wrong with Verbatim media of any kind so I will keep recommending their product - worth the little extra."
5,Macbook pro-2012,"I always have great luck with Verbatim, and these are no different. No problems at all in my machine. Will happily recommend them. Verbatim for life!!!"
4,Floh de Cologne - 'Profitgeier' (Spalax),"Originally put out in 1971, looks to be this somewhat obscure krautrock band's third album. As big of krautrock fan that I've been for at least ten years now, 'Profitgeier' is clearly an acquired taste, as it was hard for me to fully appreciate this title for what it is. Some have stated they're quite similar to the Mothers Of Invention. They've also been tagged as a very political band. Only two tracks here that made sort of an impression on me were the seven minute epic ""Wir Brauchen Keine Millionare"" and the title cut ""Profitgeier"". Check it out for yourself WHEN you're in the mood for something diiferent."
1,Never uncoils and stays flat. Never. Never.,"I have tried this product and I cannot use it anywhere I tried it. As other have said, it comes tightly rolled up. It NEVER, EVER quits trying to roll back up. Hence, while you buy this to lay flat so that no one trips or sees unsightly cords, it does not fulfill it's function. It is frustrating and time wasting."
2,Won't lay down!,"I bought this for a lamp cord in the living room. It came rolled up in a box, and I can't get it to lay flat. I even tried heating it by laying it next to a heater. Maybe it can only be used when it's taped down."
3,Mostly Great,I followed the advice of other reviewers and threw this in a tub of hot water before using it. That helped to unwind it substantially but near the edges of the concealer there is still a little bit of a curve. I've got three cords underneath this thing and they do occasionally slip out from under the concealer.
2,Dispointing Performance,"Cord concealer did appear to work with one exception. The concealer was coiled and I could not manage to get it uncoiled so it would lie flat. (Notice the ridges on the inside of the coil which would indicate it is tightly wound.) The product closest to the inside was very tightly wound and I thought it would be unusable. I had to revert to just covering the cord with a rug. So if you know of a way to get this product to lay flat, it would easily get a 4 or 5 star rating. Otherwise, it gets a 2 star rating because the rest of it works OK."
2,Will not stay flat,"As other reviewers have noted, it's very difficult to get this to stay flat. It comes rolled up. After several months of leaving heavy objects on top of it (and picking it up and flexing in in the reverse direction), parts of this cord concealer still refuse to stay flat against the floor.The primary thing I want a cord concealer to do is lay as flat against the floor as possible. This product doesn't get that part right."
4,"So far, so good","This is the 4th large coffee pot that we have purchased (not all West Bends) for our church. They seem to give out after about a year. They only get used once a week, on Sunday mornings. We have had this one almost a month, and so far it works great. The coffee is definitely HOT. Wish it had a temperature control where you could turn it down just a little."
4,Excellent Product,"This is a great hot water pot. Not sure we'll ever use it for coffee. It would've received 5 stars, but if the spout doesn't close just right it drips."
5,Coffee hour,"Our church kitchen already has owned a Westbend coffee urn for several years and it works great. When our other, very old coffee urn quit working last month I ordered a new Westbend. We are very happy with it. I got to be the first one to use it for our coffee hour and tried the first cup--it makes excellant coffee (and I am very picky about the taste of coffee)!"
3,A Lot of Material but Short on Derivations,"The book is great for presenting many solved problems in the field. However, I was disappointed in not seeing many (if any) derivations of equations. I have come to expect good, insightful derivations from reading other Schaum series like ""Vector Analysis"" and ""Theoretical Physics"" --- 2 of my favorites. I would recommend this book for college level p-chem students who want practice with the concepts."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Most of the stories in this book were written at least about 25 or 30 years ago and the so-called ""real"" stories of sex workers do not at all seem authentic. I wonder whose voice is being really being presented here? Perhaps, if you're a feminist lesbian in search of contrived writing about sex workers, then you might be interested. However, if you're looking for genuine stories of modern sex workers, in my opinion, you won't find it here. Don't let the previous reviews mislead you as they did me."
1,VERY VERY BULKY,DONT EVEN THINK TO BUY THIS. ITS probably 20 times or even 30 times bigger than your ipod.
1,this is ILEGAL!,"you CAN NOT sell a product that is copyrighted then modify it, it violates the end term user aggreement. i would not buy this item."
5,Raymac Medic-Moist Pain Aid,Wonderful! This cream has saved me from lots of pain. I use it on my joints for arthritis pain. It helps tremendously! I was skeptical when my aging mom told me about it. I love it. I even have used it on my sinus area. Sinus meds were not working. This did the trick. I woke with no headache! It warms the skin but does not burns like other creams of this type. Well worth the money in my opinion! I bought the 16 oz. jar for me and one for my near 80 year old mom. It works! If using for headache take care not to get in eyes.
3,Wrong item,"I give it three stars just because. When I get a hold of the company, and they checked the numbers that it was wrong for them. to send the Chuck for my drill. They gave it to me. did not have the right chuck for my Makita"
2,information is like a advertising brochure,I was disappointed in this book because the descriptions seemed to more like a advertsing copy for the accommodations. I could have found this information on the internet. I expect more from a guidebook.
1,Unnecessary Violence,"My husband and I thought this book was moronic and really gets out of hand when the hunter starts chasing everyone with the gun and the fox is yelling that the hunter wants to kill him. Of all the Dr. Suess books we read to our kids, this one got the boot."
5,"Basic, simple, reliable","I've tried a lot of backup programs but found none simpler to use and more reliable than Quiksync, and every time I try something new, I come back to Quiksync.I can back my files up hourly if I want to and Quiksync does it quietly in the background. It has no fancy bells and whistles, it simply does what it is supposed to do, reliably and easily.Since it backs up files (in my case to an external drive) in their native format, restoring files and folders is as simple as dragging them back to where they are supposed to go, althought you can do a full restore if you want to.It allows to back up several versions of the file and llows you to pick the time interval. One hour works for me because I am notorious about blowing out files.You will need a pretty big drive if you have a lot of stuff since the backups are not compressed (thankfully).My only negative is that the software is a bit dated and ought to be brought up to date."
2,Nothing exciting here,"I've been programming in Delphi for over 10 years, so I've got the basics pretty well nailed.Plus there's not much here about what is unique about Linux / Kylix / CLX.The Web section was particularly disappointing. No depth.Maybe a decent beginner's book."
1,Cannot play DVD,This CD wont play in a non- multi international DVD player! No good if you are in Europe!
5,Leviathan:Protector of Atlantis,"Well...for starters, this toy lives up to the ""transforming bit"" even better then I suspected. With this toy, you can create your own adventure with many possibilities. It not only comes with the Leviathan, but includes a little sub-pod to spice things up! the sub pod itself can become a sub, a tank, or a digger machine. The Leviathan has four modes: Lobster, Crab, Scorpion, and Aqua Craft. I enjoyed this very much"
5,One of the best books I've read in along time,I devoured this book. One of the best works of fiction I have read in a long time. The characters are quirky and real-straight out of Texas. Chris has written a book that is funny and entertaining but it also has a great message. Read this book and pass it on.
1,BEWARE!,"This product does NOT work with Windows ME or XP. I did not realize this and am now stuck with a program I can't use. Icode told me to get a ""new"" operating system like Windows 98 or 2000. Give me a break!"
1,TigerDirect = BAD EXPERIENCE,"The device I received worked alright for my first test recording. I recorded a song from vinyl to 256 kbps mp3 using a Sandisk 512k USB flash drive. After that, the unit kept freezing up while I was trying to adjust levels. After repeated attempts of turning unit off and on, waiting for the right indicators, setting file type, setting recording level and freezing, I packed it up. Seems to be an overheating problem. What is really frustrating is that I don't know if this is just one defective unit, or a general problem with the iKey, because THE UNIT I RECEIVED FROM TIGERDIRECT WAS A PREVIOUSLY USED, OPEN BOX. Both the outer and inner seals were broken and there were marks on the iKey. YMMV, but I am no longer buying from TigerDirect."
3,"'Shadowman' is alright, but I've read better.","I like the way the author teaches you about the Salt Wars, because I like learning new things. I'd never heard of the Salt Wars, so that made it better. However, if I'd already been an expert on them, I probably would have chosen another book."
2,Lasted less than 1 year,"Received cable in July 2011. Just died in PC area where cable was not subject to movement, constant plugging and unplugging etc. Bought 2 and one is still functioning. I guess that's 50%. Just wish it had lasted a few years longer. Going with Belkin this time."
2,Where are the shows by season set?,"I got all excited when I saw they were out, but after reading the reviews I'll wait until they finally issue the shows by season."
5,Unbelievable Value,"Wonderful looking, easy to install, and work like a dream. I installed these lights on either side of my patio door. They have all the features and they all work great! I wish I had other places that needed lights, because I really like these!"
1,"WARNING Horrible product, Do NOT Buy !","I am very experienced with installing motion lights, I know what to do.The instructions are the worst, if you are a rookie, it would be very hard to install.Mounting hardware screws were missing. ( I had some extras in my toolbox )The first light failed, does not light. Only the sensor clicks, but no light. No light = UselessThe second clicks on and off like a strobe light, unable to adjust the timer or motion sensor. Unable to adjust light = UselessYou need a very small straight blade screwdriver to make adjustments to the light. Other lights have small adjustment knobs you turn by hand. This is a very poor design.Both lights failed right out of the box, where is the quality control ? Shame on Amazon for having a piece of crap like this on their site.I sent it back for a refund"
2,I'll tell you secret about their LACKING longevity..,"I dont know if its a conspiracy or not, but these caps seem to seperate from their internals after about 35-50 fill ups or LESS depending on hard you torque the cap when closing it. Once it's open, the only thing to keep it from spinning in its ""locked"" position are wedge brackets on the inside. Once these start to wear down, you're either stuck with a gas cap that won't lock, OR even worse ---won't open (which happened in my case). The only thing that surprised me more at that point was that I was able to just pull the locking cylinder out with the top of this cap coming of with it. What's the point if it's only keeping me out. Huge inconvenince in th long run! Bring a screwdriver with you just in case if you DO happen to purchase one these cheaply made caps. I would suddest you go with the Motorad or the CST instead!"
5,Comprehensive Book on New Testament Theology,"This is my textbook for New Testament Theology at the undergraduate level. We were told by our professor that this book was written to be geared towards graduate students, but I find the book very easy to understand and others in my class seem to as well. It is a quite large book, probably three or four inches easy. A concise volume of this book used to be offered but now it is out of print. There is a chapter focusing on each book for the most part and some that are grouped together based on aussumed authorship, ie. Luke and Acts. I enjoy this book and have learned alot from it so far. For the size and content as well as the outstanding scholarship presented by the author it is a great value. Marshal is not pushy in his presentation of the theological themes and of his own beliefs."
3,"Better for visibility, don't last very long","Sylvania 9007ST BP 8 Silver Star Twin High Performance Halogen Headlight BulbI've been very impressed with how much better these bulbs light up the road as compared to the OEM bulb for my vehicle. (2004 Mitsubishi Gallant)But the original bulbs lasted over 2 years and I am replacing these every 6 months (8700 +/- miles). After the first set burned out, I e-mailed Sylvania customer service and was sent a new set.Those promptly burned out 6 months later. When the latest pair went, the only reason I purchased them again, was because of the outstanding deal I received from Amazon. The price has since gone up, but it's still half the price I would pay at the local parts store.Product Usability: 5 starsProduct Durability: 1 starProduct Value: 3 stars"
1,Complete waste of money.,1. Devanagiri spellings of names are not available.2. There are not many names.Readers will benefit more if they use 'the Oxford Hindi English Dictionary' by R.S. McGregor or similar dictionaries and look for names with Sanskrit origin.
2,Not sure,"Just wanted to say that the ship time was great, condition was as stated; however, I ordered a Franklin Covey day planner and I ended up receiving a Franklin Planner (not Franklin Covey as advertised), made in China and it was filled with Office Depot refill pages.This was false advertising as Franklin Covey(R) was stated in the product claim. Disappointed!"
3,"Bernstein great, Stern not so great","I found the accompaniment by Bernstein to be sensitive yet full blooded. However, Stern sounds screechy. It seems that he struggles over several passages, and his tone is just unfortunate. Perhaps the engineering is to blame, or the recording venue. I love Bernstein, but avoid this one. Go for Perlman and Ormandy on EMI, or Vengerov and Abbado on Teldec for the concerto. On the other hand, the Serenade for Strings is outstanding, and almost worth buying the album for anyway."
1,A basic failure to understand biology.,"I bought a copy of this book at a church yard sale for 50 cents. I may have over payed. Gish shows that he doesn't even have the most basic, High School level of understanding about biology. What he does show is his blatant and extremely biased agenda. Putting the term 'science' on the cover of this book is an insult. This is nothing more than blithering idiocy attempting to pass itself off as 'scientific research'. I have no problem with people believing in Creationism. I will in fact defend their right to hold such beliefs. But to pass such a religious world view off as 'science' is disingenuous and deceitful. There is a reason we have a separation of church and state in the US. This book is a shining example of why.Not recommended for anyone. Especially not impressionable children."
5,Works like it should.,"I ordered this for a co-worker who had to move his printer farther away from his computer. At first it didn't work because the idiot somehow was able to jam the printer side of the plug upside down into the printer port. I'm amazed it still worked, I've never seen anybody accomplish that before."
2,Is that even a color...beige?,"I thought I was ordering what was in the picture(black), but instead received beige cables. I honestly have not used them because they are the wrong color. Am I crazy?"
5,Very nice item!!!,"Heart is very pretty, and this item can enjoy arrangement.Because the middle of the heart is open, the various decoration is possible.I arrange a birthday cake or Christmas cake and enjoy it.My friends and family are pleased very much."
3,Watered-down for the masses?,"It's certainly a pleasant, unobtrusive recording. Knocking off 30% of the reverb would help, but my main gripe is that it's a watered-down version of their live performance. I had the great pleasure of hearing the quartet in Buffalo as part of the superb Art of Jazz series at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery. Live, Stanko's sparse, plaintive trumpet was countered nicely by Marcin Wasilewski's fiery and inventive piano, supported perfectly by Slawomir Kurkiewicz on upright bass and Michal Miskiewicz on drums. Wasilewski instantly became one of my fave musicians ever, but he isn't given nearly enough freedom and space on the recording. According to Bruce Eaton's pre-concert lecture, Stanko has been playing with these guys since they were teens. The history showed, as this was a supremely cohesive ensemble making great music. Nice recording, but see them live for the big picture."
1,"This is a toy, not a camera","I bought one of these puppies on eBay and it is not a very good camera. lindascameraworld gave misleading info regarding megapixels (extrapolated pixel not true image size) and DV video quality (horrifically bad). Don't even try the digital zoom except for a ""system shutdown"" special effect. This is not for anyone who wants good images or video - most cell phone cameras take better photos. Also the firmware is bug filled necessitating frequent reboots because of lockups. This is the camera I keep in the glove box of my car in case of an alien landing on the interstate.On the brighter side the unit will play MP3s and MP4s nicely after conversion and with a memory card makes a nice ""memory stick"" that can transfer data and play some tunes. This unit is worth about $75 in my opinion."
5,The Innocent Libertine,"The second book in the series Heirs of Acadia, this book has lots of history plus fiction and suspense. You'll want to have all five books in this series. It's a good read."
3,Not as good as first one,"Passing Into Light by Sharon Ewell Foster is the sequel to the gut-wrenching Riding Through Shadows. While that book was incredibly moving, this book was a serious let-down. Shirley Ferris is back, bringing her children Mika and Lex to visit her cousin Mother Johnson down in Tyler, Texas. Shirley's husband is dead, and she's trying to figure out where to go next in her life. The book had a lot of flashbacks to the previous novel, and a lot less of Mother Johnson's faith. Her speeches don't ring as true and Shirley's actions sometimes just don't make sense. Shirley is a strong, complex character, so when she contradicts herself from scene to scene, it's frustrating reading and makes her appear weak. While I do believe the Lord can do miraculous things in our lives, the neatly tied ending seems beyond the realm of believability. The first book is described as semi-autobiographical; this book is not. Perhaps that explains the emotional disconnect."
3,Great gift for elderly dad,"I purchased this clock for my father who is elderly and has Alzheimer's. We were all struggling with how to make him comfortable with knowing what day and date it was without his asking so often. This clock is pretty huge, so be prepared for that, but it has worked well for him. The drawback is that it all works mechanically with flippers that have gotten jammed a couple of times."
5,Utterly Distinctive,"Listen, this cologne is Bombastic! This fragrance is simply the best by far. Compared to all of the other colognessuch as PL, CK, NAUT... it has gotten me inundated compliments. If there is anything to be aware of with thiscologne is that, if you are married or in a serious relationship, you cannot, i repeat cannot, let you husband/boyfriend go out with thiscologne sprayed on him because when the woman catches a whiff of this scent she will be compelled to approach himwith good intentions that may lead to something of a possessed encounter. It is simply a matter of overwhelmingattraction. I hope to meet the maker of this fragrance one day, he's a genius and a wizard of chemistry.And the name holds it's true value, because without this fragrance being a member in the world of colognes/fragrances thereis no committee.Great job Puig!"
1,"10 of 10 women say ""Heck No!""","I bought a bunch of samples, Quorum being one of them and put them to the test with a bunch of different women. I expected different results and what women liked differed, but young, old, goth, cowgirl, etc... NONE of them liked this stuff. EVERY woman suggested I just throw this stuff away! How this is listed as one of the top male colognes is beyond me!"
3,Original Product?,"I have been using Quorum as my cologne since 1972. Over the years I have noticed a slight change in the quality of the cologne, how long it lasts on the skin, etc. To me this last order (the bottle I have opened) is not very good. The perfumed aroma of Quorum is not there. I am going to do some skin and paper tests, and give them a smell. It seems to me, that if a cologne or perfume company changes their recipe on a product they should let the public know. Don't you think so?"
2,Christian centric,"The book is well organized and indexed. It includes a glossary of over 1,100 entries. It is also nicely illustated, with over 200 photographs, nearly half of them in color.I had hoped that this book would be a fairly balanced exploration of the world's spirituality. It is not. It is more a history of religion with a Christian bias. In each section, except those dedicated to Christianity, one clearly gets the sense that it is written from the perspective of an outsider. Dismissive statements and questionable conclusions are the rule.Take heed from the book's preface concerning the 52 contributors listed; ""They write from a Christian concern to descibe each faith 'as it is'...If conviction shows through, however, it is because there can never be total objectivity when it comes to deeply-held matters of belief.""Indeed."
3,SWEET LOVE,"Tried this one because I'd heard the disc 'Time.' Not bad, but it doesn't really have anything comparable to 'When The Morning Comes' or 'Shon Don't Don't'"
5,Feel the difference,You'll feel the difference with these vitamins in about a week. There are no vitamin tablets on the market that remotely compares to this. I mix it with orange juice. It makes it taste like an Orange Julius. Very good.
1,How can people believe this?,"I mean seriously.....C'mon...how? I guess the people who do believe in this garbage claim to have little ""faith"" in Science. Well, explain how you are reading my words right now? The internet was not created by prayer, it was achieved through scientific pursuits and experimentation. Why do you put blind ""faith"" in Science when it comes to medicine or computers or automobiles, but then claim Science is wrong on Evolution?"
4,K&N AirCharger,"This product was a joy to install. It included every part needed, a clear, concise photo detailed step-by-step procedure, and even a list of the simple tools required. All parts were of the highest quality and the installation fit was equal to or better than factory original.It operates just as advertised, however without a engine dyno it hard to qualify horsepower but the acceleration pull feels stronger than stock, albeit with a healthy intake roar. Not for the timid."
4,vroom,"sounds great, better performance and fuel economy. install was easy and by the book that was included. about a 2 beer job."
3,Mephistopheles,"WAs discussing the play with a student today and mentioned this film, as the best thing about it was the wonderful performance of Andreas Teuber as Mephistopheles. I have never forgotten it.So, I googled and here it is - well worth watching for Teuber.C Devine"
3,Nice Cold War history book,"A nice little Cold War history book, with some interesting insight into America's economic and military policies during the time period.My biggest annoyance with the book was that the author could/should have used an editor. There are random military and air force abbreviations which the lay reader simply does not understand. Same with respect to people; sometimes they are not ""introduced"" until it is too late. Nothing a good once-over could not have fixed."
5,Beddiebye Blanket = a good night's sleep for everyone,"I can not say enough wonderful things about the Beddiebye safety blankets. We purchased 2 and have been thrilled with their sturdiness, softness and ease of use! The side zipper and velcro tabs make it easy to bundle up your baby, whether he's squirming or asleep. The blankets are soft and warm, and I love how the arms are open to prevent overheating. Simply put your little angel into his PJs and zip the blanket around him - you can all rest assured that he'll sleep safely and soundly. I HIGHLY recommend this terrific Kiddopotamus product!"
1,RIVALS ED BARTHOLOMEW'S BEST EARP BASHING,"Based on his ""well-known"" record, found in the charges against him in Tombstone, and later when he was a Federal Employee, the title could more aptly have been Johnny Behan: Scumbag. It's sales would also have been larger.Is this book worth reading? Hardly, until you've read a lot of the other evaluations of Behan in books. He was a drukard, philanderer and crook by any standards. But likeable."
2,Poor fit,The Magellan Crossover comes with a protective green rubber piece surrounding it. The GPS does NOT fit inside this case unless you remove the protective green rubber piece.
1,Peter Cetera Is The Voice of Chicago !,"How can Chicago be Chicago without the voice of Peter Cetera? I'm hoping that Chicago releases a music video compilation on DVD with Chicago songs from the past when Peter Cetera was with them, Chicago's music DVD's are not so impressing these days til one is released with Peter's voice included in it!"
4,"Great case, fits new gen iPad perfectly.","Nice case, good grip. For the price, it's a recommend. It's thin and easy to carry. Looks sleek, component access points are placed perfectly. I use with the apple smart cover. I have ordered another case (a durable leather one) as well as I am a bit hard on my tech devices and I need something with more protection for situations outside of home and work."
3,No Repeats?,"Overall, this is a standard recording Brahms 2 and 3. There's is nothing flashy or ""creative,"" just solid playing from a world-class orchestra led by a world-class conductor. I'll admit that I was a little upset by the fact that Szell decided not to take the repeats for this recording... it cheats the listener of minutes of beautiful music. However, no repeats set aside, the music is wonderful, and you can't go wrong with this recording. This is a must have recording for any aspiring orchestral musician."
3,"Pretty, but difficult to use","This book is unfortunately perhaps the only information source on rebatching soap. While to the beginner, it may seem straightforward, once you get into the process, the book leaves much information out and many questions unanswered. I tried 9 different recipes, and never did get exactly the described results, yet I had been meticulous in following instructions and measurements. One is left with the impression that milled soap processing is best left to the big factories"
3,Not for the new soap maker.,"A great book for its type, to get ideas from. It feels like doing the job twice to me. It uses a process like rebatching. I use it for ideas only"
1,Battery does not work with i1000 plus,"I bought the battery, tried to use it with my Nextel i1000 plus, and got a message saying ""Invalid battery"". Total waste of money."
5,A great read about two fascinating schools.,"This book takes its place as one of John Feinsten's best books, along with a book about basketball in the Patriot League (The Last Amateurs) and two golfing books (A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors). In all of these books, he takes the reader through a season with the athletes, giving fascinating insights into ""their world"". Feinsten seems to have empathy for athletes who are not in big-time programs, and it shows in his writing.I found the descriptions of life and academics in the service academies to be fascinating. It is amazing how the regular students and the players live and practice, compared to students and athletes at most other colleges. And when they're done, they serve in the military for 4 or 5 more years. When you see what these players go through for the chance to play I-A football, it makes the argument for paying major college players - besides providing them a free education, meals, housing, and tutoring - seem lame."
4,EXCELLENT BOOK DESPITE MAJOR FLAW,"Having served active duty in the Navy for five years and in the reserves for over four years, I was anxious to read John Feinstein's book. The book offers a terrific in-depth look behind the gates of the two service academies. It highlights and explains the extra duties football players go through while trying to maintain their academic and athletic challenges. Despite the overall excellent I gave the book, Feinstein committed a major blunder toward the end of the book while discussing the Air Force Academy. Feinstein references the movie, ""Top Gun"" and what a terrific tool the movie was for Air Force recruiting. However, ""Top Gun"" is based on Navy fighter pilots; not Air Force.Overall, great book."
1,Cheap looking,This belly ring looks so cheap! It fell apart almost instantly and it's definitely not as cute and colorful as it looks.
1,Agreed that this is a dangerous book,"Stay away from this book! Evans makes up terms for stuff that's been in psych textbooks for ages. Not only is this book not useful (since, as the other reviewers stated, her advice for dealing with controlling people is to simply say ""What?"" and a few other phrases), but it poses a danger to anyone in a severe controlling relationship--it might actually make that relationship worse by aggravating a controller. Although it's not quite the same, the book ""Toxic Parents"" by Susan Forward is much more recommended than this trite nonsense."
2,What? I paid for this book?!,"When I got to the end of this book, I said, ""WHAT?"" That's it? Just say ""What"" to someone who tries to control me? WTF? For someone new to this whole ""in a controlling relationship"", I'm still scratching my head. This book is hard to get through, has made up stories, and after reading it, hoping it would have words of wisdom. So, here they are for you:Just ask/say ""What"" when someone tells you what to do (trying to control you) and save your money. If ""What"" doesn't work, try ""Nonsense"". How better to provoke a controller to try harder."
5,Is Someone Trying to Control You?,"Ground-breaking book on understanding why someone is trying to control you. It can be very difficult to understand why someone trys to control and even more frustrating working for or with, or living with, someone who blames, criticizes, and controls. Reason and logic doesn't seem to work with controllers; in fact, nothing seems to work! This book will definitely help you understand what's underneath the behavior and how to influence the controller to better behavior. As well as give you insights and methods to influence your response and understanding. Best book I've ever read on control and response to controllers! Hopeful book as well!!"
2,Disappointed.,"Evans' other books, ""The Verbally Abusive Relationship"" and ""Verbal Abuse, Survivors Speak Out"" were excellent - I can't recommend them enough. I was quite disappointed with this book. The explanations of why controlling people are the way they are could have been conveyed in half the amount of pages used. The writing was amateurish and redundant, which really surprised me coming from Evans. I felt like she was writing for a grade school audience here, nearly talking down to the reader."
3,Good Ideas But Would Like More Solutions,"On the positive side, I think that the author presented an interesting perspective on how to recognize and understand controlling people. I also agree her focus on the importance of encouraging people to acknowledge and appreciate each other's individuality and authenticity. However, on the negative side, I found the book quite repetitive. I was also disappointed that only one chapter out of thirty provided suggestions for dealing with people who try to control you. Though Ms. Evans included some accounts of people who recognized their controlling behaviors and tried to change their ways of relating, I think that in general those who would benefit most from the ideas presented in this book would not be the ones who are likely to read it."
5,"How control freaks do it, and why!","Control freaks are baffling and hurtful people, and often they only pick on select individuals (often on people who insist on asserting their own individuality). Woe to you if you are one of their victims!But here's a book that tells you how it all works. Or at least provides a theoretical framework that you can understand and apply in real life.My favorite aspect of this book is that it's not just another book about women married to dysfunctional men. It's about how controllers work in all areas of life, marriage just being one those areas.Stop being a bewildered victim of people with conrol issues. Buy this book!"
2,Maybe it's me,"It could be that I'm not equiped to understand the concepts presented in this book, but I am very disappointed. 'The Verbally Abusive Relationship' is great without a doubt, but this one just wore me down until I gave up halfway through. It's like I was just turning the pages desperately in the end, waiting for the author to get to the point. A frustrating read in my opinion... or maybe it was just me."
5,I can see myself and others in this book.,"I think Patricia Evans is onto something here. I read this book out loud to my husband and we realized that both our mothers were spellbound. That's why we could never meet their expectations and why they seemed constantly angry. I have to admit that I have a relationship or two like that myself. I think my brother disappoints me because I am relating to a fictional brother and I think I am a fictional sister to him also. We have expectations that are almost never met by the behavior of the other person. Letting go of those expectations may someday lead to a real relationship. Most of Ms. Evan's references are to controlling husbands but there is a much broader application. I realize now that I have ""backwards connected"" to strangers before. I assumed I knew what they were thinking and made a comment about it. Most of the time I was right but sometimes I got a strange look. Now, I know why."
2,Rambling and Repetitive,"She uncovers and names the monster without sharing the details of slaying it. Simply saying ""What?""to a person who is dictating control is hopeful thinking as a means of stopping the behavior. It was a simple yet confusing book for me to read."
3,Just great,"It is a wonderful collectible and one of the funniest moments in the simpsons series to me. It's a shame that the doughnut feeder doesn't work, I start to turn the the little handle and then it kind of gets stucked, suddenly a click can be heard and the next turn all the little doughnuts go flying everywhere. It isn't much of an issue though since I just want it as a display rather than a action figure."
5,Great Documentary of Our Fall Football Traditions,"For anybody who ever played high school football, this brings back those memories and reminds us why we played. For those who never played, it gives great insight into the life-shaping experiences that football instilled in those of us who did play. Learning to work hard, sacrificing for the good of the team, learning to win with humility and lose with dignity were all things I learned on the football field. The interviews with such outstanding coaches should be mandatory listening for all high school students because they talk about football and about life. If you played, or had a son who played high school footbal, this is a must to watch, and remember."
5,Capture the spirit!,"Awesome Documentary. The commentaries, the music, and the film clips captured the spirit of what it is like for these athletes playing under those Friday night lights. Great video for current football players, but an even greater video for ex-football players and parents of all of these athletes."
5,boys of fall,"if you played high school football, you have to own this dvd. share it with the world. it is what high school football IS about."
1,Multi-dysfunction -- so bad it's painful,"Wow -- I can't begin to tell you just how incredibly terrible this stupid combo machine is. I bought it, tried to use it, and it just wouldn't print. Well, it would print for a little while, then claim it was out of ink, then sort of recognize that it really did have ink, then if you cleaned the heads 30 or 40 times, you'd get back up for a day or two, and then it would cycle through the fun all over again . . . for a few times. Then it would just stop printing alltogether. So I called Brother, and then sent me a complete replacement machine. And it did the same thing. So I called Brother. This time, they said the warranty was only 30 days long, and so I needed to contact their service center. Sure, that's what I'll do. I seriously plan to take this machine out into the yard and smash it with a baseball bat, a la Office Space. Seriously. What a piece of crap. Where's the Brotherly love?"
1,DONT BUY FROM THEM-EVER,"I bought this a month ago, I paid Dish tv to come out and install it and guess what? The receiver could not be used because it was still leased, plus they didn't ship all the parts to me, left out a remote control as well. I contacted them and they didn't respond to me. I am glad that Amazon was able to give me my money back."
1,Defective,Purchased a 625 DVR from satellite oasis DVR was defective still out $95 not to happy this was one of my first online purchases left a very bad tast in my mouth
1,Bugs and more bugs!!!,"I get a DVR625 when I start service with Dishnetwork and I cant believe that something this cheap is the hook that they use to get new customers... the first thing I notice is how big the unit is and how much heat generate!! after I turn it on and try to check some of the features I can see the firmware is kind of odd and hard to start, I was not able to find use to more than maybe 2 of the functions on the sistem... and then the hardware!! I have a total of 5 coax cables coming out of the damn thing, no small cables or internal jumpers, NOOO!! 5 full size coax RG-6 cables just there, plus the power cord.After maybe 90 days of use the DVR just go bad, the Tv1 light is on and off and no signal comes out of the machine no more... maybe the extreme heat, and the cheap fans that sound like are coming apart are the root of the problem, I dont know but now I cant watch tv until maybe two more days when Dish send a new unit (I hope no a 625!!)."
2,"Unreliable DVR, Will Make You Want to Cancel Dish","After having this unit for two years we are cancelling our Dish service. The DVR would often skip recording events. Then it would stop recording things we had scheduled to record ads that Dish had forced onto the system. It also didn't record complete episodes. I can't tell you how often I missed the last 20 minutes of major shows because the DVR didn't record correctly. Avoid this unit and don't subscribe to Dish--they weren't helpful, they raised rates without informing subscribers, and they tried to force me to not cancel. It took two hours with six different Dish reps to finally get it cancelled. DirecTV is much better."
3,Inexpensive but...,"I ordered two an one was bad. However at this price, I guess that's to be expected. It's still better than paying 5x as much at a brick and mortar."
1,Cheap,"I guess I got what I paid for. The cable works, but it only produces a black and white image on my TV. Oh well, not much $$ spent."
5,michael,"works fine with a normal HP 1320 laser printer, that's pretty much of it. Not very long but in a good shape!"
3,Startech 6ft Premium USB 2.0 Ab High Speed Certified Device Cable,Product arrived in good time and shape. However I had ordered the wrong size as the male end was too large for camera orifice.
2,Unmarked package,"While I'm sure the cable is fine, it comes in an unmarked package. I didn't know I had bought it on Amazon, I didn't know it went with the printer I bought. It was beige not black like the picture. I tossed it!"
3,A surprising end,"This book is a story about the life in a academy. It is interesting to see how the different boys managed the schooldays .The main persons find a new way to express their feelings because of the new English teacher. He told them to seize the day with poetry. I think it is understandable that some boys, above all Todd, don't feel like the teacher Keating. It is interesting how he change from a shay little boy to a boy who live the poetry and have his own opinion. I think the last scene is really typical for that. Todd is the only who really take part to Mr. Keating.Neil also is a main person who characterise this story. The passion for the poetry and acting is really refreshing.The end of this story was really surprising for me. I didn't count with the death of Neil. I can't imagine how he could kill himself for his dream.It was an interesting book but sometimes unimportant things are describes to long."

He tells them to seize the day with poetry. I think it is understandable that some boys, above all Todd, don't understand their English teacher Mr Keating at first. It is interesting how he changes from a shy little boy to a boy who starts liking poetry and has his own opinion. I think the last scene is really typical of that. Todd is the only student who really takes part in defending Mr. Keating.Neil is also a character who is very important in the plot. The passion for poetry and acting is really refreshing.The end of this story was really surprising for me. I didn't expect Neil's suicide. I can't imagine how he could kill himself for his dream.It was an interesting book but sometimes unimportant details are described too long."
3,"Dead Poets Society - worth to read, worther to watch","I've watched the movie in school (part for part, because our teacher loves it to interrupt) and I've read the book,...well... at least not the whole, but I can say that watching the movie ""Dead Poets Society"" is really more fascinating and exciting than reading it. You get a deeper impression of the characters, of their feelings and thoughts. And of course the atmosphere of the school, Welton Academy, is a must and you do not find that in the book. With Robin Williams as the mainactor the movie has a great ""Hollywood-potential"" and that makes it a lot worther to watch. It's quality. It's a dramatical story (-although it has it's fun-moments-) about thought-control by school and ruling parents.But,... enjoy it yourself!"
2,Backstage pass to the movie,"I've seen the film several times, until we started to read the book in English class. My opinion on the book a bit split, because I never read a book that was as close to the movie as this. Normally films are made after books and you can see the diffrence of book and movie . Then you can decide which one you like most or wether the film was giving back the theme of the book. This book is as if you were watching the film , but you can't see the emotions of the actors, which are very well shown.If someone is watching the film and doesn't understand all of it , the book might be helpfull. I would recommend to watch the movie and then , in addition, read the book, because in some scenes it can be like a backstage pass to the movie."
4,It 's like in real life,"As I have read this book and I had the feeling it was a special book because the author wrote it like real life . I do not find this book excellent, but good. You can learn so much and this is for in every life situation. It was very interesting to read something about a private school. I always thought that the students in a private school had only one goal to be very good students who want to become lawyers or doctors. But I noticed that they had some other goals too. They are like all students you who do not attend a private school. Seize the day!!"
2,The Novelisation: A Big Disappointment,"I love Dead Poets Society. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've watched, ever. It was one of those that deeply moved and touched me. The stories of these boy's lives touched me, as they were so true to life.However, after reading the book of the movie, I have to say I'm left terribly unimpressed. It read more like a kid's novel than anything else. It lacked depth and emotion. The characters were all made out to be shallow, childish and weak, while Mr. Keating's part in the changing of the boy's lives was terribly downplayed. Some of the very poignant scenes in the movie were simply not justified in the book.I have to say though, that I have to give credit to the author for some of the extended scenes that were deleted in the movie, but apart from that, it's a big disappointment. It's okay for a read of the outline, but really, you have to watch the movie to really know and understand what DPS is about."
2,Slips off shoulder easily--needs more shoulder grip,"Looks great and aesthetically matched my my Victornox briefcase. HOWEVER.....this strip was slightly different than the original manufactures' strap and it slides off my shoulder way too easily. Whether walking, using a staircase, et cetera; it slides off my shoulder way too frequently. This product needs more ""grip"" for the shoulder so that it does not slide off the shoulder so easily."
5,Very comfortable,"After trying seven or eight different brands, this is the most comfortable strap that I have yet found for hauling heavy laptop bags, camera bags, etc."
4,"It's an adult hat, but we made it work anyway...","My son had to be George Washington for his 3rd grade biography, and this hat was huge but it very durable, it stayed on his head, and it looked pretty darn good with a ruffled collar, white wig, and blue suit."
4,Awfully Anglo -- but still worth a read.,"Like most reviewers here, I agree that this book is a bit unballanced. It is indeed biased to rock/pop. More so, though, it is biased to British rock/pop. Very little is said about US record production except when various Brit producers head to the US to ""learn American tricks"". Uhhhh... like what, exactly, guys? Nonetheless, this book is full of great info about the (very influential) Anglo music scene. More than anything else, it chronicals the increasing influence of studio technology on the way music is made and the rise of the studio itself as a musical instrument, and not simply as a passive tool for recording music."
3,"a selective, not comprehensive history","Cunningham's extensive use of quotes from interviews keep this entertaining, but don't look for focus or a truly comprehensive history of the subject. Also, poor punctuation, grammar, and the typically confusing syntax common to the British pop press render many sentences nearly meaningless. For example, the first sentence of chapter eleven: ""And so the Nineties, or rather the effect that current musical principles and technology will have on record production in the future."" Say what? Fortunately, most of the producers and musicians interviewed speak better than the author writes (not his fault, really- where was the editor?). In the end, though, anyone interested in a behind-the-scenes look at the recording of many classic records should have fun."

2,Beware,"This vitamin says Lutein in it's title, but it is no where to be seen in the ingredient list! So don't buy this supplement if you are looking for Lutein for eye health."
4,Captain Newman M.D.,"I remember as a kid watching this moving on TV and I loved Gregory Peck. The movie had so many stars, Angie Dickerson just to name one. It is very timely for today with all the service men and woman coming home from the Middle East. It was sad and funny with a message for all of us."
4,Very Good Show!,"Captain Newman, MD is a very good award winning movie from theearly 60's. If you can forget the searing visuals ofBand of Brothers and put yourself back in a more innocenttime, then the drama presented by great performances byBobby Darrin and Eddie Albert packs a wallop. Possiblythe best performance of either of their careers.Gregory Peck establishes a sound foundationthat allows them to soar. As always,Robert Duvall provides a solidly enjoyableperformance. Sadly, the writing and low production valuesremind me that this was the time when movies were losingmoney and audience to Ed Sullivan. But, if you makeallowance for that, it can be a great experience."
5,Great Camcorder - Samsung SCW62,"For the beginner or someone needing a second, inexpensive camcorder, this one is great. Generally, easy to use but with many features. I didn't expect this much from an inexpensive unit. This Hi8 camcorder is easy to hook up to a VCR for copying to a standard VCR tape. The battery charge lasts for the full time, as advertised. My only complaint, if you can call it that, has to do with the marking of the buttons on the top of the camcorder (EDIT-, LIGHT, EDIT+, and DATE/TIME). They have dual functions depending on which mode (Camera or Player) has been selected. However, they are marked for only one option. The user has to remember which button to press. For example, to PLAY, press the LIGHT button). This can be confusing intitally. Regardless, this is a fine item for the price."
3,Too many pictures not enough instructions,"The main problem with this book lies in the fact that there are a lot of pictures for things they do not have instructions for. Anyone who has children will see the problem in this right away...your children are inevitably going to want you to build the things there are no instructions for. If you are a first time builder, this will not be something you can do.Aside from that, the instructions they do have seem thorough and easy to follow.If you know what you are doing this will probably be a good book for ideas, but if you are a first timer like myself, keep the book away from your kids or you'll find yourself in a bad spot. haha."
2,Good Pot,"This is a decent coffee maker though i wish it had a auto shut off when making the coffee, it happens often i dont want to wait til it is done brewing and want a cup NOW!Easy to clean, nice style, brews nicely!"
5,Great coffe maker,Great coffee maker easy to use & nice design. I bought one and then received a new one as a gift which I'm selling
2,Just Okay.,"Great coffee maker, terrible carafe. Water spills everywhere when we fill it up, and often drips coffee when we pour."
4,Gevalia Drip Coffee Pot,"When my other free Gevalia Coffee Carafe broke, I called the company and asked if I can purchase a new carafe. I had not continued their cofee program, but kept the pot. Their customer service insisted on sending me a new model and carafe, even though I was not a current customer. Their last model was not as good, because the carafe kept breaking in the dishwasher.This model is fine. However, my new Cuisinart 4 cup coffee cup seems to make hoter and stronger coffee. I still like my Eight O'clock Decaf coffee and won't switch.Not sure if Gevalia is making a wise decision to be sending FREE coffee pots for life to people if they are not customers. Don't know how or why they do it. But ""thanks Gevalia."""
3,Doesn't go far enough,"I've had to take away two stars off because the producers of this DVD did not give a season one, two, three etc. of these Lassie TV episodes. It was Tommy Rettig who first played as Jeff Miller in the Lassie TV show, later to be followed by John Provost. When Tommy Rettig started to become too big and old for the TV series, he was replaced by John Provost. It was a nice transition from Tommy Rettig to John Provost. I loved the Lassie series as much as any kid back in the late 1950's to early 1960's. So I make an appeal to the producers of Lassie. Please put out DVD's of the seasons of the Lassie TV show."
2,A Great Romeo...A Woeful Polish,"This 1958 recording of the Romeo and Juliet Overture-Fantasia was originally paired with Stravinsky's ""Firebird"" on vinyl. It was one of the highlight recordings of the early-stereo era. It stll retains its fire and passion on the CD transfer. The Third Symphony (recorded some 15 years later) certainly could have used some of that elemental urgency. Bernstein doesn't SHAPE the music whatsoever. He allows his troupe to simply play the notes, without benefit of a guiding interpretation. The result is an uninspired nullity. The two best recordings of the Third (both presently not available) are Riccardo Muti and the Philharmonia on Angel and Lorin Maazel and the Vienna Philharmonic on London. Absent the release of either of these, there is simply not a satisfactory recording of the ""Polish"" on the market at present."
4,Major League Baseball 2K6,"I bought this for my grandson for his birthday. He plays it all the time. He likes that he can have his own player with his own name,espically when the announcer says his name! It was a very good buy and he's still playing it almost a month later."
4,IF YOU KEEP THROWING WILD PITCHES READ THIS!!!!,"I had the same problem as everyone else who said that their pitcher would throw a wild pitch whenever a runner got on. I found the trick. I have a gc so it might not be the same as other consoles. All you have to do is hold the L button for at least 2 or 3 seconds before the pitch and then pitch like normal. If its not the L button then look in the games manuel under controls and see what the ""Hold for Pickoff"" button is. I swear to god it will work and save your life in this game."
5,HP DELIVERS WHAT IT PROMISES,"I HAVE FINISHED TESTING ALL THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS NOTE BOOK, AND IT SHOWED TO BE ENTIRELY WITHIN EXPECTATIONS. EXCELLENT COST/BENEFIT RATIO!HUGO GERBER"
1,All 8 HP Pavilion DV64XXXX models refer to the same cutomer reviews!,"Dear Amazon,All 8 of the HP DV64XXXX models share the same customer reviews?As of 8/27/07, there were 17 customer reviews and regardless of which model is picked from the dropdown, the same 17 customer reviews are displayed.Unless the reviewer specifically included the model number in their review, how is anyone supposed to make sense of the reviews?On top of that...4 out of 5 stars are given for model number ????I guess it's buyer beware..."
1,I can't be able to get rebate from HP..,"I'm one of the HP notebook users and I don't wanna to use any HP notebook anymore till I saw the new pavillons.. The pricing was excellent and decided to buy one for my wife.. After getting the products I get the rebate from amazon directly but it was diffucult to get from HP. I provided everything that they requested and send them the documents with postal mail however they didn't get it and if they don't get it they are not responsible to provide me this rebate with any information.. I can't believe it..!!! After a while my notebook begins to work slowly, since I'm a technical guy I understood that there is smthng wrong with the main processor.. My mistake was to buy a HP again.. :( I won't recommend anyone this new pavillons.."
3,Good textbook but confusing..,"This is a fairly good textbook, very colourful and has a good layout. However, it tends to jump into topics without a smooth transition, assuming that you know enough to fill in the gaps. And there tends to be a lot of detail. Very poor section on Obs/Gynae history-taking and examination. Gynaecology topics tend to be handled better than Obstetrics topics. If you already know something about Obs/Gynae then this textbook may be a good choice. If you're looking for an introduction to the topic, look elsewhere, as it will overwhelm you."
4,Great Book. Great Price!,Good book to develop the conceptual understanding of how health can be viewed as a product of both individual production and individual consumption.
2,No Drummer.........!!,"As as avid Sting fan of many years standing and a musician/drummer in various bands I have always considered the drumming dynamic of Stings music just as important as his lyrics, guitars and arrangements. He has utilised some of the best drummers in the world on his recordings to date and they contribute considerably to his success and my enjoyment. Imagine my dismay when I viewed this DVD to find only programmed drum parts and just a live percussionist!!!. In the opening dialog Sting openly admits having dropped drums and drummers because ""they get in the way of the song"". A very bland performance compared to his previous recordings - if I'd known there was no drummer from any review or even from the outer cover of the DVD I would have thought twice before purchasing this recording. Sound and picture quality are great but the DVD has been put at the bottom of my play list"
1,STING IS A POMPOUS SELF SERVER,"I like Sting's music. I watched the concert he did on 9/11/01 and enjoyed it immensely. He had almost as much self-marketing crap on the disc, also, as music. Hey Sting, we don't care about the building of your sound studio. I don't need to see you give big, girly, hugs to the members of your band. It does not thrill me to see you barefoot playing guitar in your hallway. I could care less about your interactions with people that make you feel like a mini-God. Get over yourself. Sing the songs and shut the F**K up. Don't sell us on how much you can buy or how much others love you. GET OVER YOURSELF. Sting would never have sex with a woman that didn't scream his name at a pitch only he could appreciate.Not enough music for me on this disc. However, more shameless plugging to stroke his humungous ego."
3,"Very concise and detailed, although very dry","To say this book is dry and dull is an understatement. There is a ton of information presented, which would otherwise be fairly exciting to read about, but the author presents it in a certainly British manner that is cold and most uninteresting. I got halfway through and quickly lost interest. Leafing through the remainder let me know that I did not miss much."
1,YUCK!!!!,"I watched this movie well, it was AWFUL!!!!!! I HATED IT!!!!! THE PLOT WAS STUPID, THE MOVIE DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENCE, IT WAS JUST DUMB!!!!"
1,Works but won't stay connected to network,"Bottom line, don't buy it unless you want to reboot the thing several times a day. It just will not stay connected to the network more than a few hours at a time. My other camera (a Panasonic BL-C30A) stays connected non-stop without a problem (but it has no audio). I'm retuning the Dlink tomorrow."
1,Serious Product Flaws DCS-950G,"After reading mostly bad reviews, I took a chance and bought this product. True to the majority of reviews, the camera is subject to locking up regulary. When it worked, the picture quality was good. Tried to work with DLINK and they were no help. They acted as they were not aware of this problem, but they must be since everyone returns these camera's. I saw similiar reviews for their other models as well. My guess is they have a serious firmware problem they need to fix. With so many models to choose from, you would think they have enough invested in this product line to fix the software. I am going to try the ""4xem Corp. IPCAMWLPTG 4XEM Wlptg 802.11G Wireless"""
3,Wireless camera,"This is a inexpensive wireless camera, I especially liked the email and motion detection features these were very useful. I do not like that the camera would lock up every couple of hours and I would have to reboot it. Other than that it is a simple camera to set up and easy to use."
1,The CD errors out... enough said,"I'm not into writing reviews, but this product is bad enough that I felt I had to. I'm an electrical engineer by trade.So, I bought the item, and tossed the CD in. THE DAMNED CD SYNTAX ERRORS OUT. I know a few other people have mentioned this as well, but come on, D-Link... that is just lame. The software won't install.I went to their website to download things, and the software they have is out of sync with the manual. I cannot get my computer to see my webcam, so I am stuck at step 1. (Okay, step 2, step one is ""power the thing on"")D-link has lost my business. This is just sad. Releasing a product that they didn't even bother to test. They should be ashamed of themselves."
4,Complicated Issues in Simple Words,"Should English be declared the official language of the United States? Should students be educated in their native language? For how long? Why? This balanced examination of a hot issue, originally written for young adults, can be used in college level courses in sociology, education, and politics. Providing a historical overview often missing from newspaper articles in 8 concise chapters, the book provided me with a far better understanding of the complicated politics of simply teaching English as a Second Language to immigrants. I found the complicated arguments, presented in relatively simple words, far more interesting than jargon-ladden essays usually read in university courses."
3,wouldn't play,Be careful if you get this - mine would not cue up to play the concert performance - just shut off. The documentary played fine. It's a shame - this David Fray seems like a natural with Mozart.
4,They work like they're supposed to,"Simply working just as they're supposed to. Wish the adhesive was a bit stronger but that's how it was designed. Price is a bit high as well... oh well, it's still a good product."
2,This book was way too predictable,I felt that this book was way too predictable and boring. It lacked an exciting plotline and the scenes were way too short to capture my attention. I brought it on vacation and had to buy another book because I couldn't get through it. It would've been much better if the romance between these couples was more built up. The dialogue did not really hold my attention either.
5,means 5 stars if you don't know,"forget the 2 parts zappa, 1 part king crimson, 3 parts residents, 1 part tom waits, 2 parts rush, and 1 part ruin...Primus has again broken any classification and produced great music. If you think its ""weird"" you're not alone. However, if you don't like it, you are. Every track is truly amazing amongst the new 5 songs w/mary, pilchers, carpenter, fats..and what the heck, rapscillion being my favorites. The dvd just highlights why primus may be the greatest musical group ever put on the earth. Can't wait for primus to come to NY. All I can ask for now is another album."
3,No substitute for a real-life instructor,"There isn't much I can say other reviewers haven't - it's not the absolute best for instruction (sometimes she wears black in front of a dark background; her variations on basic moves aren't explained), but it is a good focus for someone who has a bare-bones knowledge of some of the moves and wants to see some practical application of how they can be combined.The only thing about the DVD is that the chapter breaks are *not* at the beginning of each move, so you have to use the 'rewind' function rather than the 'skip' function. Other than that, it's well-organized and she is a competent bellydancer."
1,Waste of my money,"I was very sorry to have spent nearly $50 of my hard-earned cash on this. I felt that the first (introductory) DVD was impossible to follow, so gave up. Also, the editing style is extremely annoying -- the ""wipe"" transitions between segments made me motion sick. I wasted my money -- don't waste yours."
4,Tease,"Good splatterpunk containing extremely relevant, current biotech issues, really only dealing with animal rights indirectly. Too bad that We3 only lasts three chapters -- just not quite enough to really explore the themes involved. As a result, a couple of moments Morrison resorts to almost offhand remarks that may come across as preachy and dismissive. While good, the length makes the overall effort seem hasty and leaves the reader desiring more perspectives. Above average artwork; worth reading once or twice."
2,"Familiar Sci-Fi Tropes, Overly-Manipulative Storytelling","I'm having a hard time deciding whether I liked this or not or not. It definitely hits you over the head with the pretty familiar scifi tropes of HUMANS: BAD, SCIENCE: BAD, NATURE: AT BAD MAN'S MERCY, WORLD: BLEAK... To be honest, those aren't my particularly favorite scifi tropes; I typically like my scifi more whimsical and less overtly BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAK.I found the story profoundly sad and grim. And while clearly that was the intent, I couldn't help but feeling as though it was overly manipulative as opposed to a good, clean piece of scifi. Also, the writing wasn't really great; it really does continually hit you over the head with the aforementioned topics.Gorgeous art, but not my favorite graphic novel."
2,Not every original idea is a good one,"Not sure what this story is about, really. I've been reading graphic novels since I found ""The Dark Knight Returns"" among some magazines in my english school, 25 years ago, and I never had any problems with bizarre themes, but this one was just too silly for me. Come on, a rabbit killer ? Could be a good enemy for the Powerpuff Girls..."
5,Grant Morrison's most human story... and its about animals,"Grant Morrison is best known for his complicated stories rife with insanely original concepts and ultra-cool dialogue you can't find anywhere else. We3, however, is simply a story of three animals trying to find their way home. While, admittedly, the animals are cased in millions of dollars worth of military hardware, all of that is secondary to the very simple, very heartfelt storyline reminiscent of the old family classic, ""Homeward Bound."" Add a little ""Robocop"" and a strong animal rights undercurrent to the mix and you have We3. Despite, or maybe because of, its simplicity, We3 is one of Morrison's most accessible stories. Frank Quitely's page designs are both cinematic and inventive and his pencils evoke strong emotion, particularly in the sad eyes of Bandit, the canine leader of the group. We3 is an instant classic and a prime example of Morrison and Quitely's legendary partnership."
5,This book will haunt you.,This book made me cry like a baby. I don't think I can honestly say that about anything else I've read.
2,These graphics are so horrible.It doesnt look like anything.,I think that the SNES and Game Boy Advance F-Zero games are so bad.Theyre the worst looking games with the most pointless horrible graphics.Sure the concept is great race in the future at great speeds but the graphics are god awful all it is is a track and a different color background thats basically how stupid the graphics look.Theres no things that would make a city look like a city in Mute City or Big Blue.Just a track and a blue background.It is so horrible.I recommend you get the N64 version which is much better and has detailed graphics. The background in FZero X is so much better than Maximum Velocity.In F Zero X the backgrounds look almost as good as the ones in the F Zero Style levels of Super Smash Bros Melee
2,gets old fast,"yes when i first got it it was fun and cool and in two days of playing i almost finshed the whole game the only thing i really didnt do was get the last vessel. i don't think you should get this game instead get mario kart, but if you really want this game get it used! trust me after playing this game for about a week you wont want it! got out and get mario kart instead!i give it a two only because i had fun with it for a few days but now im sick of it!"
3,Good launch game brought down by a poor soundtrack.,While I still play this more than most of my Game Boy Advance games it is a little disappointing.Yeah yeah yeah the speed is excellent and its pretty fun but thats about it.Its really not as good as any of the other F Zero games Ive played and I think its because of a poor soundtrack.I really liked the music in the past 2 F Zero games but the music here was just too bland and it was mostly drowned out by the sound of the vehicles engine.I know that a soundtrack isnt everything but to me it adds more fun to the gameplay.Hopefully the new F Zero game coming out in September will be better but if you play your Game Boy Advance a lot and like racing you should still buy it.
5,Next-gen Racing,"A cut down form of the N64 version, but with even faster gameplay. Quite hard to get into and very challenging at the higher difficulty levels. Once you've mastered it you feel you must keep playing, even when you've won the race. A better time is always possible.The tracks are inventive and varied and the music is pretty good. The other racers have good A.I but there is an annoying catch up feature that means even when you drive a perfect race they will still be just behind you.Even with its minor faults this is a GREAT game and well-worth buying."
4,F-Zero races to the finish,"F-Zero is a pretty asewome game. it can be extremly chalinging but u litterly cant put it down. Alot of the vechiles slip or cant turn well but one called JB Crystal is the most well balanced one. I would recomend this game to you if you have played F-Zero X or a SNES version of it and if you like Racing games. If you thaught you were an F-Zero master, boy are you in for a big surprise. :)"
5,oh my god this is fast,Have you ever played a game where you can feel the actual speed of it. This is the game and I don't know how i can say no to its beautiful well done graphics and awesome detail in audio and visual. Buy this game and be very satified. reasons- 1. has good graphics 2. tight controls 3. feel the g's 4. impress your friends 5. wont be a dissapointer and worth the money
4,You NEED it to be sabbat,Ha I always am picky with my reviews so a four ain't bad at all it is great. It definately was a great book just to read and definately interesting I wished the camarilla could be that interesting to read about but they are not. It is great for the mental development of any character that is antitribu...a definate recommendation before you even try to play a sabbat character in a camarilla bound world...it will add years to your character by realizing they are not blatantly outforth evil and givingyou more to work with....Enjoy the reading and the help.
3,Dont buy this book by itself,"The Sabbat sourcebook is an insightful look into the Sabbat vampire system......if you already own the Revised system book. Many of the paths are confusing and Much of the Serpents of Light info was simply left out. Its a good book, but cant stand alone."
1,Waste of time,The Dorman 741-769 Window Regulator was not worth my money or time. My old window would not go up because the teeth on regulator bracket were worn down. After installing the new one the window was slow moving and made cracking noise. It was installed fine double checked that. It turned out the motor on the thing said 12V but it was half the size of my old one with the same voltage though. So i took off the new motor and put on my old one and it worked fine. Took up a lot of time believe the Dorman 741-769 Window Regulator is a faulty product. Should just beable to send the motor back and get half my money back.
1,Worthless for stated purpose,The glass lid doesn't sit securely on the dish either right side up or upside down so you can't move the dish with the lid on. There aren't any handles on the dish -- not even a slight protrusion -- making it impossible to hold the dish in one hand unless you're willing to support the bottom of the dish with your fingers and fold your thumb over the edge and into the interior of the dish. I don't recommend that if the contents happen to be a hot casserole or if your dinner guests are finicky about hygiene.
5,"Beautiful, versatile piece!",This casserole dish is very good. The glass is very strong and beautiful. It is great to prepare foods in advance and just reheat them at dinnertime. My husband likes to make microwave-oatmeal in it. Great buy!
1,Shades of Robert Francis and William McGonagall,"Timothy Murphy is one of the upcoming ""New Formalists,"" having debuted with his first book in his mid 40s. This is his second full collection, and like the first, it contains mostly terse, trimeter ditties on topics such as business failures, hunting dogs, alcoholism and man-boy love. At their best, they remind me of neat verses of Robert Francis, at their worst, of the doggerel of William McGonagall."
1,A surprisingly dry read,"Stanton's writing style is full of military jargon (although he does try to explain things). He repeats a lot of details and names.Fortunately for him but unfortunately for the reader, he had a relatively uneventful deployment, which contributes to the feeling of repetitiveness.So there's little entertainment value (there are a few intermittent bits of humor). However, there may be some historical or educational value."
5,For any child (or adult) that has lost a canine companion,"Dog Heaven by Cynthia Rylant is the book for any child (and adult even) who has lost a faithful canine friend and companion.The story and descriptions of Dog Heaven are simple yet fitting. It's guaranteed to touch the heart of the parent reading it to their child. Cynthia Rylant's colorful book will comfort both young and old, reminding them that heaven is a wonderful place where their departed pet now runs, plays, and munches on a dog biscuit or two. Both God and ""angel children"" look after the dogs in heaven because, ""God knows that dogs love children more than anything else in the world."" He truly knows how to make every dog happy."
5,What is the Quran according to itself?,"Madigan's sweeping literary analysis of the term 'kitab' and its Arabic root ""k-t-b"" will prove to be immensely valuable for uncovering the earliest Quranic conception of the nature of Muhammad's recieved revelation. What results in Madigan's analysis is a picture of a uniquely Quranic conception of divine revelation and given to humanity--one that itself points to the transcendent supratextual nature of the Qur'an itself. What appears to me to make this work even more balanced and useful is the dialogue that Madigan often enters into with other classical Islamic sources while constructing his own independent position. The discussion of al-Shafi'i's reatment of the Quranic trope ""al-kitab wa-l-hikma"" is particularly notable.The text itself is beautifully printed and includes both Arabic texts and translations of the sources quoted. One could hope that the high quality exhibited here will quickly become the standard rather than the exception in the field."
3,Nothing New,"A fairly mundane look at Congregational Care. It was all the ""normal"" information -- nothing new here."
2,Devastated!!,"This book was delivered upside down. I have seriously cricked my neck trying to read it.Even though, I'm not Asian, I am also non-rascist and would welcome the comely embrace of a female human of any hue.But I can't do it with books which are so sloppily printed. I have decided to emigrate to Australia and chance my arm with some non-discerning Sheila's."
2,Anything but prodigious,"I personally found the book lacking, in what I like to call ""chutzpah"". I gave this book to a friend who needed some help and the ""step-by-step guide"" provided in this tome is anything but. In many cases he found the steps to be nebulous, ambagious, and even geared towards the derelict reader. The book, as a whole, was definitely not multifarious. I would not extol this literary work."
1,The non dvr,"This works fine for trnsfering vidio from a camcorder,vcr,ect using composit or svidio inputs and once the vidio is copyed to your HD you can't get it into imove to edit the software is verry poor not to mention you can't watch or record tv.All in all don't buy!"
2,Company of Dogs,The only thing I liked about this book was the pictures of Wegmans beautiful Wiems and the cartoons. There were a couple of nice stories but as a whole the book was unmoving. These are not touching stories of lifelong companionship.... This book was quite a disappointment. At least some of my money spent helped needy animals.
4,preschool/kindergarten,This is a 'must have' book for any teacher at any number of years teaching experience. What I really like about this book is 'at a glance' one can pick up ideas/tips that are ready to try 'NOW'.
4,Good Solid Disc Real Country Music,George Strait Sounds Real Good On the Duet with Alan Jackson Murder On Music Row.Country Music Like other Styles OF Music have Been Increasingly watered Down over the Past Decade for More Mainstream Acceptance but Strait doesn't fall into that trap.His Music Has stayed solid.Adalida still sounds great.He is One Of The Very Few Artists in Country Keeping the Music Real.
3,"Best Straight single in 5 years, ""Murder on Music Row""","""Murder on Music Row"" is GS's best single since ""I know she still likes me (but I think she loves me anymore)"" in 1995. It is actual country music. The rest of the album is filled with the terrible sound that George let his music become in the late 90s. He still sounds fantastic - and he even makes some of those terrible songs listenable...but George Straight is capable of so much more than garbage like ""True"" or ""Blue Clear Sky""...""We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This""...George really shouldn't be singing this.But on Murder on Music Row...there is at least a chance that George Straight will decide to tell Tony Brown to take a hike - and return to his ""Does Ft Worth Ever Cross Your Mind"" type of albums and sing the non-pop influenced country music he does so well."
4,"I'm not much of artist, cute book though","This book was required material for an art class I took. It had a bunch of fun little drawing activity for you to do. It really focused on just drawing and not caring as much about how it looks, which was definitely good for me. If it wasn't required, however, I probably would not have bought this book."
3,Fun for kids....but,I was a bit disappointed in the approach to drawing. I'm sure the kids will love it and will probably learn some basics. Just5 not what I had expected.
3,Night of the What?!,Ok folks I am giving this one three stars too many I think. I am giving it three stars mainly for the awesome pumpkin costume that was made for this movie. It would have been better if they would have made this more of a horror movie rather than a comedy. It's pretty stupid. Straight men will love this movie for all the pussy and boobs. Tons of full frontal nudity with the women...I actually sat through the whole thing but not sure i could get through this one again...it just wasn't my type of movie- it was strange..
1,oh god its awful,"I'd give it zero if I could, but the one star is for Motorhead. If hair metal is your thing then you will probably enjoy it although many of the tracks aren't the bands most famous. All I can say if thank you FNM, Black Crowes, Nirvana, Pantera and everybody that killed off this horrible genre. My favourite moment was when Warrant got cherry pies thrown at them on The Word."
3,"Clip mechanism is good, Pole too flexible.","I completely agree with the other review. The pole is WAY too flexible. Trying to clip is like playing an arcade game (plus you will look like a total dork at the crag while the thing waves around). Just buy the end piece and get your own .490"" (or larger) aluminum tent pole from Tentpole Technologies."
2,Just seems cheap,"Overall workmanship seems below par. For example, the lid does not fit well. I wish we had spent more money and bought quality."
2,"Only one drawback, but it's a big one","I have used these casserole dishes for years, and they look great. However, taking one of these out of the oven when hot is scarey. No handles and hardly a rim to hold onto. I finally caved and bought a different Corningware set - with handles!"
1,WHERE IS IT?,"Since I have never received the item in question, I cannot at this time give an honest review. Of course it has only been 4 weeks since I ordered it, so who knows where it is?"
3,"Nice, but no 'Tanto Tempo'","Bebel Gilerbto's 'BEBEL' is her most English CD. A mix of Brazil-Pop and coffee-time English niceties, this album attempts to attract a wider listening audience rather than enticing her standard listeners. The outcome falls short of appeasing anyone.With the exception of 'Aganju', the album is a less than spectacular, and a bit dissappointing to her loyal listeners.Bebel's pretense may have been understandable, but I fear she soon will be overtaken by the growing numbers of Brazilian chateuses who have better range and an unwillingness to covert music to other languages. While I appreciate her willingness to adapt to English songs, she will never be known as an English singer. Something she should appreciate."
2,Not Tanto Tempo,Well this has been quite a disappointing album. She has such potentional to shy away from the typical jazz sound and Tanto Tempo shows this. I liked one song on the whole cd. I didnt like it...
5,my first car,my dad god bless him bought me a car at 15 which was identical to this one when i got this cxar from u it took me back thank you greAT product
1,Put together by a blind man,"I received the book very quickly. However, the front cover was on upside down. I guess nobody checks the merchandise before shipping it out. And my husband hates the fact that there are no pictures of the food."
2,Stylish but not functional,We got this bag from our baby shower. I was really excited when I first saw it because it seemed stylish and my husband would be able to carry it around without feeling less manly. But the down side to it is that it's too hard to find any of the baby's stuff that's in it. There's hardly enough room to put anything. It would be perfect for older babies where you don't have to bring alot of stuff but for younger babies I still would choose the traditional shoulder bag over this.
4,"Neat bag, but too small","This is a really nifty bag. I love the shape and the ease of carrying it. But the inside just isn't big enough for every day use for me. I like to be prepared so I pack a little of everything. I plan on keeping the bag for walking trips, vacation, and specfic events, but I'm still looking for a bigger bag to have for all the time living (we are rarely home)."
4,"GREAT bag, two minor drawbacks...","I love this bag so much -- it's UNBELIEVABLY comfortable, which is the best of its perks. I've sworn off every other diaper bag and made this one my one and only...That said, there are two minor drawbacks. One (previously mentioned) is that the zipper can sometimes be a little difficult. I've only noticed this with the bottom compartment, and I suspect it has something to do with the shape of the compartment (not the actual zipper quality). The other drawback (not a big deal) is that the mesh compartment for mom's water bottle is too big/loose... Even when I put a big bottle in, it seems to slide out (maybe it's too short?). Even still, I would buy this bag again -- it's SO comfortable."
1,Junk,"I hate this stupid bag.The elastic on the back pocket separated from the mesh within about a month of using it, the zipper pulls come apart (super! diaper bag with a built-in choking hazard!) and there's really not a lot of room thanks to its unique shape. Now, I admit, the shape seems like a great idea, and is what attracted me to the bag in the first place, and I've seen lots of other sling backpacks that are exactly what I expected this one to be, but this thing slides around when I bend and fits like crap. I cannot believe the number of good reviews I'm seeing here. It's the only diaper bag I've ever had, so maybe all diaper bags suck? I dunno. But this one does."
3,Slingback diaper bag,"Nice looking, but getting the bottle in and out of the compartment is hard and if it leaks, the compartment is difficult to clean and smells."
1,Wouldn't make this a first pick.,"The concept of a backpack diaper bag is what attracted me to this particular bag. After making the purchase, I used it only once. The zipper is very difficult to open with one hand and having the opening on the side, things would fall out (if I could get more than the changing pad inside). There isn't much room for more than a couple of diapers. The cellphone holder doesn't move up and down the strap much, so half the time it was right in my face. I am still searching for the right diaper bag for me. Right now, the free one from the hospital has worked the best!"
2,Great style but SMALL,"I love this style of bag, it keeps everything out of the way and on your back and doesn't hurt your shoulders. But it's such a tight fit in there!I generally carry 2-3 (cloth, so slightly bigger) diapers , wipes, a change of clothes, my wallet and a sippy cup, and those *barely* fit. When we were going on a longer trip and I wanted to cring toys I had to big another bag for them. Definitly not for newborns and I wouldn't really recommend it for anyone who brings more then the bare essentials."
4,Awesome,This is a most amazing CD. The message provided in the 80s rockstyle songs is inspirational. Jamie Rowe would often visit our local video store in Irvine and belt out tunes on the spot. It was such a pleasure to have known this talented and caring person.
4,Great,"I needed this textbook for a Stats class, however the book was in great shape and its content is pretty thorough (applies fairly basic statistics to a wide spectrum of research applications). Some sections, however, are easier to comprehend than others for those of us with a ""journalism"" mind."
4,Helpful,This book will help you for understanding some basic concepts about handwriting. Ideal for those that don't know anything about this exciting and unexplored aspect of our personality.
5,Handy reference for clinicians on herb safety,"This book is a must for any practitioner of botanical medicine. It is a quick, concise guide to herbal safety. It clearly discusses controversial issues, rather than just randomly trashing herbs based on rumor and innuendo, as so many books in the mainstream medical establishment seem to do. A great work. The appendices at the back discussing important issues in more depth are particularly well done."
3,not really a review,"i am a lukewarm cyrkle fan, and haven't heard the album. just a point - their hit, red rubber ball, was a john simon (of georgie girl fame) song, not paul simon"
4,a solid album with few exceptionally good songs,"This album has its moments. Songs such as Nick Cave's ""Little Water Song"", Tom Waits' ""Purple Avenue"" and Philp Glass' ""The Streets of Berlin"" are captivating and full of grace. Lemper's performance is, as usual, very well. She puts her full range of emotions into each and every song. It's always a pleasure to see her coming out with new materials. However, I find this album is a bit on the pretentious side. Some songs are over produced. Personally, I prefer Berlin Cabaret Songs which came out a few years ago."
1,Junk,"A piece of junk. The instructions don't match the screen, and they don't work on Vista as advertised. Do not buy this product unless you enjoy being frustrated."
4,"Good book-not ""BRAND NEW"" quality","The book is great, there is no doubt about that. I will say though, the book came in a simple bubble envelope, and the book itself had a little damage to the corners and edges of the book. Now, I am a super nit-picky person when it comes to my books, because I like to take perfect care of them, but for the price, you get the book, quicker than it says, and its in ""Almost New"" quality :) The damage probably just came from shipping."
4,The Big Red Cadillac of Coleman Campstoves,"Wow, was I surprised at the size of this stove when the box arrived! All in all, I'm still very impressed. It burns nicely and is easy to clean. My cast iron pans fit perfectly. It's a stove you can use while camping and as an additional backyard barbecue cooking surface. No camoflauge for me; I love the flashy fire engine red color. I'd give it 5 stars if it were just a little lighter in weight. Still, a very good quality product for the price."
5,Great little heating dishes,"I use these CorningWare French White 7-Ounce Ramekins, Set of 4 quite often to heat things like butter or small amounts of sauces etc."
4,tragedy in halifax,This is an amazing story of the tragedy in Halifax at the beginning of the last century. The author almost makes you feel as if you were an eye-witness to the event taking place.
5,Another City Unprepared For A Disaster,"Ms. MacDonald has researched the definitive account of the destruction of the City of Halifax, Nova Scotia during World War I. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong : from the right two ships colliding (one of them carrying nearly 3,000 tons of munitions) to the bomb ship drifting to Halifax before exploding and the blizzard that struck the City afterwards.The disorganized search and rescue attempts through the snowstorm of the City in rubble (think of the destruction caused by hurricanes or by an atomic bomb) takes up the last half of the book. Nearly 2,000 people were killed by the blast with disabling injuries for the thousands of survivors. Ms. MacDonald writes of her native City with more detail than was perhaps necessary but the story is a page-turner and serves as a warning to the reader that life has not changed much in terms of disaster relief over the past century."
2,Somethings missing,"The book was ok shape, but the needed cd with the templates had been removed so that was an extreme down side."
2,This CD needs improvement!,"Ormandy tried, but failed on this recording. The tempos were a bit slow, and the overall sound quality of this CD makes this dynamic piece sound weak. It has its good moments, but in general, Ormandy does not make this piece sound the way it should."
4,not for thicker laptops,"intended to use on my gaming laptop so i don't get oil stains from my hand on the nice finish.. with ergonomic support as well.. i guess its for the conventional laptops (not thick gaming laptops).. works very well with my ibm.. I still use it on my gaming laptop though.. still fits, just that it doesnt sit as nicely as it should..bottom line.. i would still buy it if im given a second chance.. i recommend this product.. my gaming laptop is 15.4 inch, ibm is 14.1 inch.. haven tried on a 17 inch though.."
2,hard as rocks,"Hard. Rocks. Nuff said. I'm sure they help someone, but not me. They do seem to be well built rocks, but the rocks (memory foam) is far too thin to do any good, for me at least."
2,no better than youtube,"Unacceptable levels of artifacting. Legend of Korra is great, but the quality of the download is no better than a youtube video. If I'm paying for HD, I expect it to be crisp and clear with no blockyness on it what so ever. The sad truth is that it is not crisp at all even after downloading. If this was streaming video I'd give it a higher rating, but it's not."
5,Love it!,"Any fan of the first series has high expectations for this one. Would the show have the same feel? Would the animation be totally different?It looks like the series is off to a good start with this episode, paying respects to the first series and also establishing itself as a different story. The first episode sets the new avatar Korra on a journey to master air-bending that'll happend over the rest of the season. Korra is completely different from the sometimes shy Aang, but impossible not to like.The writing is strong, the animation is great, and I can't wait for the rest of the season."
4,The whole family loves Korra!,"Following in the wake of such a great series that was the Avatar: The Last Airbender, Korra brings a fresh perspective to a world we are familiar with. Ranging in age from 10-35, everyone in my family enjoys this series."
4,Worthy Update to Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Got this when I was home recovering from this flu bug that's going around. Watched with no expectations (LOVED Ang and the others even though I'm technically an ""Adult"") and was greatly surprised! Pacing of the story was good and surprised at the fact it didn't ""talk down"" to the targeted audience of young folks who live on Nickelodeon. Wasn't a rehashing of the previous show and stood on its own."
4,Very Good Series,"This was a very good series. I really enjoyed the original series, this is not as good as the original but still a very fine show. It is not as funny as the original, but the action might be better."
5,Just Simply Amazing,This show is just as good as the old show. The action is more fluid and human like in this one though. I love the older characters. Its a great show all around. Totally recommend it.
2,Has some good ideas for the SAT but save your money,This book contains several useful points about the SAT I essay. Useful exercises to teach you how to generate ideas for essays are on pages 92-94. And an exercise to teach you how to create an opening paragraph is on page 94. I would rate this book with 2.5 stars if I could because it was somewhat useful.
4,Read this book for the first story...it's a gem,"Innocent Erendira and Other Stories should have been entitled Innocent Erendira and Sketches. The only real story is the title piece, The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Erendira and Her Heartless Grandmother. The other stories are mood pieces about death--interesting, but only in the way Rembrandt's doodles might be interesting. They are worth looking at, but don't really stand on their own. The title piece, however, is a gem, filled with true Garcian flare--the Caribbean circus, frantic desert chases, strange gringos, exploding pianos, treasure, obsession, repression, confession, and hilarious one-liners. When Garcia Marquez pulls the stops out, there is nobody like him."
3,NOT WHINING LIKE SOME PEOPLE BELOW..............,"Look, for under 10 bucks you get a pretty nice set of tunes, upgraded/punched up in good flavour. If you want the flat 2-track style '60's material, it's out there.Sorry that this cd did not advertize all of what the whiners wanted, and they may have a point, except this IS a good recording,just short of great in my mind because it gives a little extra spice to the old material that one would expect in the 2000 era, but yet it is not overly soupy, sweetened up or distasteful.You'll put it in the player, and all of a sudden you're going to stop what you are doing and say, "" Wow....this sounds different....then you'll start really listening to it (that's the reason you put it on, right?) and you'll be pleased with the upgrades. Filler? Maybe, but that's how filler can be, but it's listenable. Remastering can be poor or good. This is good."
5,"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy by the Buckinghams","This is, plain and simple, a feel good album, taking the listener back to less complicated days. My personal favorites on this CD are ""Kind of a Drag,"" ""Don't You Care,"" ""Hey Baby, They're Playing Our Song,"" and ""Susan."""
4,Basic Collection Of Hits,This ablum is the best basic collection of the Buchingham's hits that I could find.
3,The Car Thief,"Weesner brilliantly portrayed the life of a car-thieving boy and alcoholic father falling further apart from one another while dealing with their life choices. There are several characters you're able to connect with, whether you're on Alex's side because you know what it's like to have an adult figure with a substance abuse problem or if you are the one actually experiencing the alcoholism. I felt as if I understood the trials and tribulations Alex went through and was constantly rooting for him when several people didn't care enough.Weesner understood the true feelings behind the characters and though you may leave the book behind those pages will never leave you.I think this is a great literary read for High School students but not necessarily one I'd read just for fun."
1,Horrible!,"This is a crime of a book--not a single redeeming character in the whole lot, and that's saying something. I originally read this in high school and hated it, but went back to it to see if it was better with a little age. Answer: No. The plot still stinks, carried by characters you loathe and don't care about. Avoid at all costs..."
5,"Great DVD, only one weak short.","A-PLUMBING WE WILL GO (1940) is my favorite Curly short. It's got hilarious scenes and tons of fun. Curly's maze of pipes is great, even though Shemp does it better in VAGABOND LOAFERS (1949). A+WOMAN HATERS (1934) is the only short on the tape that is bad. Spoken in rhyme. This is the first short, and one of the worst. D-PUNCH DRUNKS (1934) is okay. There's some funny scenes. At least it's better than WOMAN HATERS (1934). C-MEN IN BLACK (1934) is great. This was the only short to even be nominated for an Academy Award. There are great gags. ""Did you ever see and apple with the skin on the INSIDE?"" This deserves to be nominated for an award. It should've won. A-THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS (1934) is funny, co-starring Lucille Ball. The Stooges and Lucy. Who wants more? A-This also includes MICRO-PHONIES, one of Curly's best."
1,"POSER, FAKER, RUBBISH,",wow this cd is sooooooo rock and the lyrics r sooooooooo deep and this is just an amazing song
1,You make me wanna HA-HA,"I am laughing at you Ashlee. What the crap - you have blond hair again. Now you are talking about doing 80's music? Here is an idea for anyone who actually spent $13.00 on this cd single - go take your money and burn it. Now repeat after me - ""I (your name), promise to never buy another item that puts money in the pockets of the Simpson family, and will not go see the Dukes of Hazard movie"".This song sucks, she has that big muppet nose, and her hired bandmates should be ashamed of themselves at selling out and being easily replaceable parts in this ""band""."
5,HOT,"For 3 reasons:The Song: a really fun song that every girl and maybe some guys can relate to!!The B-side: a romantic ballad about summer love, reallly romantic and softer side to Ashlee.The remix: Great, Too, Dance, Too!!!"
4,Nice book! Lacking on pictures...,"""Shell Art"" is a very nice book. It is extremely informative. The only issue I have with it is that I feel there should be some sort of picture diagrams accompanying the flower-making explanations. Other than that, a lovely book!"
1,Fears of electrocution!,"We bought a KRUPS in 2006 and I must admit it lasted an adequate amount of time (5 years), until it started to leak from the bottom of the main unit onto the base! We foolishly decided to buy another one - we like the look and the speed it boils water. However, 10 months later and this kettle is leaking too! I can't believe KRUPS have made no attempt to improve the design! An electrical base in a pool of water ? Come on! This is frightening!"
2,Leaky,"I got this as a gift last Christmas. It worked as it should; boiling water quickly. Then it started leaking from the bottom about a month ago. So it lasted less than a year. I will replace it with another brand, also will most likely get one that is all stainless steel and not plastic."
1,Used for just over one year and it leaked,"Was pleased with the kettle until just after one year (as the warranty ran out) it began to leak. Each time I used it, the countertop was covered with water before the water even had time to boil.Very unsatisfied although I had liked Krups products before."
1,"Worked great for 6 months, now it leaks.","My previous kettle was all stainless and simply wore out after many years of trusty service. This Krups showed up under my Christmas tree in December of 2009 and it was immediately set-up in my kitchen. My first impression was that the water had a plastic taste to it, even after following the instructions and boiling a sacrifical pot of water (which I did several times). The plastic taste either abated after several weeks or I got used to it (don't know for sure), and the kettle quickly became just another appliance in my kitchen. That was until it started leaking. At first I wasn't sure if the kids had just spilled water on the counter and failed to wipe it up under the base of the kettle; however, as the leak got worse it became obvious it was the kettle and not the kids that was to blame. So much for fine looking Krups, I'm buying another Oster stainless kettle; much less bother."
1,Krups quality is gone? Stay away from this kettle,"My previous Krups Tea Kettle lasted for about 6 years and served well. Finally it broke and we bought and FLF2 model as a replacement. After 6 month, it started leaking. Krups replaced it. We stayed 3 weeks without a kettle waiting for the shipment. After 2 month it started leaking again! Krups replaced it again. 2 weeks of wait. Now, 3 month passed it is leaking AGAIN! As many other reviewers say, it is a defective model. If not leaked, I would call it below average quality - on/off switch some times turns off right away. It is also quite noisy.Stay away from this kettle and probably from any other kettle made by Krups. Leaking is quite dangerous - it floods the base and may cause a lot of trouble."
1,Disappointment,I was so happy to order this Krups FLF2-J4 Cordless Electric 54-Ounce Water Kettle - what a disappointment- it worked about 15 times and then the switch stopped working. I wish I had looked at the reviews prior to purchasing it as the switch problem has been ongoing.
2,"Fine for 2 years, then leaked 1-2 cups water per use","We've had this kettle for 2 years and it worked fine, until recently when it started leaking water. It's up to about 1-2 cups per use and I keep it in a plastic bucket. Called Krups and they said it's out of warranty. I'm going to try Braun next."
2,Defect in design,I really loved this kettle however it began to leak in the seam of the window. I tried all kinds of super glue but nothing worked. I will hesitate to buy another on from this company!
1,A real piece of junk,"We had cordless electric kettles for years, without giving us any trouble.This one started leaking after one year.Behind the name of a German company is the crappy manufacturer in China.We will be more careful with Amazon in the future - we will not buy anything unless we know where it was made.We suggest you stay away from this brand name!!!"
1,Great while it lasted,"We received this kettle as a wedding gift 2.5 years ago and I guess we were one of the lucky ones because it lasted so long. Woke up yesterday and found a pool of water, went to Amazon to look into a replacement and when reading the reviews, we have to agree with virtually all of the other reviewers who mention that the unit will eventually leak from the base of the unit. I guess we should count ourselves lucky that out unit lasted more than the average 6 months that others are reporting. We will be looking for an alternative as $60 is too much to spend on this kettle which doesn't even have a part which can be replaced."
2,This kettle leaks,"We've had this kettle for exactly 2 years. It still boils water, but recently we've noticed water on the counter top after each use. Today, we saw that it is leaking from the part where the lower end of the handle attaches to the body of the kettle. There is no crack or any obvious defect. We checked the Krups website - nothing helpful there. We've used the kettle almost every day for the past 2 years, but it was never handled roughly, dropped, damaged etc. So why is it leaking? I just checked the Amazon reviews of other brands and saw that someone had the same problem with the Cuisinart electric kettle which is purported to be made of stainless steel (the Krups kettle is plastic)."
1,Sprung A Leak,"After a brief five months of use, this kettle sprung a leak where the bottom of the handle meets the kettle itself. The list price at Herberger's was $90.00. Fortunately I did not pay that much with a coupon, but it is really disappointing that a brand with that sort of pricing cannot deliver a quality product. It's a drag to think our landfills are filling up with so many plastic appliances that fall apart in less than a year. i do not recommend this kettle at all."
2,"Terrible customer service, unreliable product.","I liked this kettle while it worked, but it didn't work long enough. It began leaking at the bottom at just over a year, and Krups' customer service was dreadful. They don't stand by their products, and I won't make the mistake of buying one again. Though I don't believe they need to warranty an item such as this one indefinitely, for the price it should last more than a year. To make matters worse, Krups diverts warranty and repair issues to a third-party repair company, thereby limiting Krups' own dedication to customer support.Two stars because it was good while it lasted.Goodbye, Krups."
1,Broke down after 2 months,This tea kettle worked fine until it started leaking water after about 2 months. We had Braun model before this one and that worked for 4 years. We will definitely not buy anything else from Krups anymore.
4,Worked great until it started leaking...,"We got this kettle on Amazon three years ago and it has been great. It was our first kettle.Pros:We love that it boils water so fast (all those watts!).The cordless base is very handy.All around it is very effective and a pleasure to use.Scale cleans up really well with a vinegar soak.Cons:The lid is sometimes finicky.When it recently started leaking water, I disassembled it to see if it could be repaired. There is a hairline crack in the plastic at the base of the handle - repair is not likely.Krups customer service was very good to work with and sent us a rebate for a new one, even though we are two years out of warranty.This was a great first kettle - we are going to retire it to the camper and replace our daily unit with the slightly less powerful, but (hopefully) more durable KRUPS BW500."
3,Mine lasted about one year,I had one of these kettles until two weeks ago. It worked great for one year (give or take) and then wouldn't turn on. The problem appeared to be with the kettle's connection to the base.
3,Difficult to tell they are hearts,"Very easy to cook and remove from pan.The heart-shaped cavities are so rounded that it's hard to tell the little pastries are even heart-shaped when they are out of the pan. Top part of heart needs to have a stronger dimple, and bottom part of heart needs to be more pointed."
5,Love this!!,"This is a very sturdy product. I work at a climbing wall, and therefore I belay a lot...so I typically go through carabiners very quickly. This one has not shown any signs of ware so far. It's pretty heavy and I wouldn't suggest it if you are looking for a light rack. But I love this for day trips and work! Very glad that I bought this product."
1,buyer beware,"Like all the others, I bought this movie on the 11th and returned it on the 12th. The game froze up on me. Worse, the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache. This one game may push back the advancement of the X-Box 360 for at least a year. At least the people gave me a full refund. I used it to buy last year's far superior original X Box game. If you have last year's 2k or MVP, keep it. Skip this piece of junk. I don't think I will buy a 2k game ever again."
3,HD + No internet = $$,"I have a Premium system, so I didn't own a memory card. MLB2k6 had a bug that caused a REGULAR (as in every time I played) crashes. I didn't have internet at the time and couldn't download the patch, so the only solid solution was to buy a memory card. Of course, about 2 weeks after that, we FINALLY got internet (3+ months of waiting for the install) and was able to download to patch. I downloaded the patched and it hasn't crashed anymore. It is still buggy though. Bad rush job, but good game overall."
2,good game but freezes a lot,It is a good game and fun to play once you get used to all the controls. The big downfall of this game is that it tends to freeze a lot.
2,Not a game for the baseball nut,"Ok,So I thought that I would give this game a chance since my son and I love baseball. I read all the bad reviews and actually purchased the copy cheap off of EBay.This game is terrible. Controls are bad, confusing....graphics are ok...but what makes me furious is the player rankings...they stink!Chase Utley has a D for fielding.....this list goes on...I just got done going through 3 seasons of GM mode and went to the World Series every season. Duh. Where is the challenge.I downloaded the updated rosters and they were even wrong.So disappointed in this game...i hope that they spend some time on the next one because it is obvious that they rushed this one out for the release of the 360.Better luck next time."
3,Ended Up Getting The Wrong Game,My seller ended up sending me the Xbox original version of this game which is still in its shrink wrap in my collection of video games. From what I've been told this game is very easy to complete and is also a decent baseball game.I'll write a better review when I make another attempt at buying this game.3 Unknown Stars out of 5.
3,MLB 2K6,"I bought this game Like New, and it even had the little cards in it :) to finish my collection of 2K sports baseball games on my 360. It's really not that bad, but I would be pretty disappointed if had payed 60 for it. The player models are a letdown, but the rest looks pretty good. Sound pretty stupid huh? Fielding is a bit crap though."
4,Excellent Book... but... lots of statistics...!,Really nice book but plenty of Statistics instead of more Yankees history. A great add-on to the stats fan. Great B/W pictures !
4,It Works!,I purchased this product and mixed the black cherry with Dark Brown. I was skeptical because when I looked at the amount of the product I didnt think it was going to be enough. Well it was and it left my hair soft. I relax my hair and I did not have any shedding.
4,Louis Jordan at his best,"Of the R&B pioneer Louis Jordan's series of low-budget musical comedies, this is the best by far. An interesting look at Black college life in the 1940s, this is the tale of Jordan returning to his old college to settle scores with a rival and raise money to save the school. Not as corny as it sounds. A bit more story and better acting than what usually appeared in Jordan's comedies. Jordan is of course at his best with his clowing and singing, and sax playing, but he also shows that he could really act when called to do so. Check it and enjoy."
3,Ok musically,"I don't recall all the titles of songs on this one, so it may not be as detailed a review as needed...It wasn't bad, I just thought the music lacked ceativity. I always look for unique melodies, or chords used in different ways (i.e. J. Moss; Kim Burrell; even Hezekiah Walker or Ricky Dillard) They manage to keep it fresh. I also thought her voice was mediocre. It's nice, but I felt she had trouble staying ""on top"" of notes, and went flat on some songs. That's just the musical opinion. On the other hand, I am very happy Joi has given her heart to the Lord and decided to use whatever gift she has for Him. That's the most important."
5,Lyrical rendering of the old West,"Beautiful descriptions of the western scenery, and a compelling story which makes one appreciatehorses and cowboys, and vast ranchlands, and the values of loyalty and dedication."
2,Religion or western.,It seemed to be a lot of Mormon religion rather than a great western.the ending was in conclusive.Not my favorite.
4,Good western,"True classic western"". Zane Gray I believe is popular because he is able with his writing to give you a clear mental picture of the caricatures and there surroundings, for me I am able to read his books while it plays like a movie in my mind."
4,Zane Grey Book Review,"My husband likes Zane Grey books, price was right, he would recommend it for other people who enjoy reading Zane Grey books."
5,Great Fun,"I really enjoyed this book, it was such great fun. Gibson painted Dylan and Hope with enough realism to make them interesting and it was fun to see them circle one another and fight their attraction. Their romance was as believable as the genre allows, and it made me want to read more from this author. Highly recommended, especially if you need some cheering up and want to put a smile on your face."
2,Very Poorly Written Book,"I'm sorry, but I never liked the heroine. I found the book way too contrived and almost insulting in its lack of ingenuity and scene plots. (I'll admit being a reporter for tabloid magazine was a fun idea.)Honestly though, I put the book down half way through. The characters were not believable nor was the plot intriging. Sorry, I don't like writing a harsh review but I really thought the writing was bad and will never, ever buy another Rachel Gibson book."
4,truly delicious,"I have read every book that Rachel Gibson has wrote. So, when I saw that ""True Confessions"" was being released in July, I was really excited. Hope Spencer is a tabloid reporter that moves to Gospel from L.A. Dylan Taber the local hunky sheriff eventually becomes her love interest. Until we get to that point the book is funny and I found myself smiling. Dylan's son Adam is a likeable kid and the residents of Gospel are so entertaing that I liked all the characters. This is not one of Rachel Gibson's best but she made me want to read about Hope and Dylan that once I started the book, I didn't put it done until I finished it."
4,As advertised,My daughter seemed to enjoy putting it together and painting it. It turned out very nice. She used it as part of her school science project.
2,"If you know the basic rules, this book may be too easy for you.","I bought this book after tried online go for a bit. I knew the rules so I wanted a basic book for the fundamentals. I was quite dissappointed with the content of the book. The first five chapters are totally irrelevant to the real go game. The author decided to include first-capture go for some reason. It's nice to get the background knowledge, but devoting half the book to something even small kids would get bored in an hour is totally beyond me.The book comes with plastic pieces and a 13x13 paper goban. I tried it with my girlfriend and we couldn't even make the pieces stay. So that's useless unless you have tiny figures or you use a tweezer while playing.I don't recommend you to buy this book. If you want to learn, buy something more challenging. Otherwise you will be disappointed."
5,Belly Button Book...,We have purchased many of Boynton's books and have been very pleased with them all. This book is a great addition to our little one's collection. Would definetly reccomend others to purchase this authors books.
1,False Advertisement,"I received this item in the mail today and it is CLEARLY not the hat shown in the picture. I was sent a flabby white fisherman's hat and in no way resembles what is shown in the picture advertised. Though I only lost $7.49, I'm more pissed about the false advertisement than the small loss of money."
1,Poor start,A HARD start makes this game difficult to get into.If this game had a simpler begining and got harder as you progressed it would be a better game
5,pleased,I got this game for my son he just loved it. ty ty so much one thing tho the shipping cost was kind of high
2,Beware of no return policy,I bought a different one from this company and it did not meet my expectations. I tried to return it. They said no returns. So i am stuck with this disappointing water cooler. Beware: There policy is no returns. Check terms and conditions on their site. Plus their no spill system which is contact with the water is plastic so i don't see the point of buying a stainless steel reservoir.
1,Dorman 51482 Buick Park Ave Mirror Glass,Doesn't fit the 2002 Buick PArk Ave with heated mirror and auto dimming features. I called Dorman and they do not make the glass to fit this mirror.
1,didn't fit,They got it wrong but there is a better solution go to auto zone buy a big truck mirror - trace out exactly the outline of your old mirror go to a glass shop and have them cut the mirror and they may even attach it to your car with some silicone and tape after it sets you can take the tape off..!!
3,Sound Quality,I can hear it. ( my tapes ) but it sure isn't HI- FI .Maybe it's MY hookupMaybe I expected too much via blue-tooth and my hearing aids
4,decent product at a decent price,"Purchased this product to transmit from my tv to bluetooth headset. It was easy to set up, use and has been working great."
2,Wi-Fi Killer!,"This Bluetooth adapter WILL completely destroy your Home Wi-Fi Network signal and slow it down by 90 percent.also, sound does not sync when watching video, sound is off by a quarter second or so.other than that, this product is easy to set up and use."
1,Not recommended,"I kept up on the Peterson case via media reports and now read the books for additional details. This book delivers nothing other than the chapter on Ralston and the underwater sonar. The rest is a total bore. One woman's opinion, you might say and a little of that went a long way. Too far.I do not recommend it at this price. If you desire to read it, I would say wait for a cheap secondhand version."
1,Not in line with Law Enforcement,I work in Law Enforcement and find this author's treatment of those who do protect and serve reprehensible. Scott Peterson was convicted due to impeccable police work and detective organization of the case. This book is an afront to those of us who dedicate our lives to serving people like this. Who will she call when her home is burglarized? Thankfully she does not live in CA.
1,The Title of the Book Says It All,"Unfortunately, that's all the book says. The daily news reports and interviews were more easily digested than the many run-on sentences the author throws at her readers. In addition, the author's attempt to establish credibility to a subject with which she herself was an outsider is sorely lacking. I'm sure that many individuals related on some level to the tragic tale within the pages of this book, but several authors have done a much better job at conveying the full impact of Laci Peterson's death. ""For Laci"" by Sharon Rocha is a much better read and provides much better insight of this case from a credible perspective. Save your money (and your library card) for some worth while read."
1,A rambling disaster,"If this book was really on a shortlist for an award, all I can say is that the other entries must have been even worse than Stone Cold Guilty - hard to imagine.This ""blook"" is a rambling effort of spewed out by a writer who seems to believe good writing consists of navel-gazing followed by a lot of adjectives.There is no research here beyond reading media accounts of the trial like everyone else in the world did. The ""exclusive"" sonar information is a fraud - the sonar operator, Gene Ralston, told Dillon to stop using his name to promote this debacle.This is nothing more than an attempt by the author to insert herself into a murder trial as if she found it vastly entertaining. How insulting, to Laci and her baby and her friends and family. Their murder trial wasn't a ""play""."
5,The whole story,"I found out about Loretta Dillon's book when I saw it mentioned on certain internet crime forums. I was curious as some professed it was excellent and others bashed it horribly. I decided to read for myself.The book starts off with Laci's disappearance and follows every development along the way. This book is absolutely outstanding, enjoyable and informative.You would have to be crazy not to enjoy it and appreciate the value of this body of work.Beuhler"
2,Not my favorite,"It was not my most favorite out of all the books on the Peterson case. I preferred Amber Frey,Catherine Crier and Anne Birds."
1,plebeian book,From what I have read in this book so far is nothing that a true crime fan could not have found online or on the news. I have to agree with the other reviewers in their opinions that this book is a bomb.
4,Interesting Mix,"Part memoir, part court reporting, part backseat driving, Dillon's book on Peterson is a revealing and practical view of the case and trial, from the earliest news stories to the final sentencing.Dillon's commentary reflects many viewers' ideas and hers is the voice of the avid follower.Structured like the web log from which it was taken, it is an unusual but interesting mix of genres. At times it was fascinating, at times funny. It is a throrough book with many unreported facts and an interesting take on the underwater investigation that didn't make the news at all.Combines instruction, inspiration, and the best of the armchair cyber sleuthing that Dillon put on the map. Very good first effort."
3,Not one single picture of Laci,This book was interesting and there was information in it regarding the Sonar used in the search for Laci that I hadn't read anywhere else. The author is a good writer and is comical in some of her observations regarding the trial. My only complaint is that there is not one single picture of Laci in the book. Why?
1,futile attempt,"the author made a half attempt in writing. I feel she just copied alot of it. She has no endorsement to play armchair dr.Just alot of jabbering. Her wit has alot to be desired. Not trying to bash, but telling you how I see it."
