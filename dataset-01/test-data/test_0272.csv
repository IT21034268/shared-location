5,Earings.,I bought earings from this user and they were here within 3 or 4 days. Very fast delivery. Also they looked even better than I thought. I would def. buy from this user again.
2,The proprietary watch band is an issue,"I own the men's version of this watch, which has the same type of unique watchband, which is made out of denim fabric.The watchband is only available from Movado.I wore out the original watchband within 8 months, and the second one only lasted 6 months.The watchband costs $200, so factor in spending $200-$400 a year just for the watchband.I will not buy another watchband, so this Movado will never be worn again."
1,wrong blade,I ordered two 4 inch tile saw blades and was sent two 6 inch blades which are useless to me this will be the last time I use amazon
4,Refreshing an old stand by,"My kids and I love the Pirate's board and the new titles like the ""Docking Fee"" instead of the same old original Monopoly...I didn't give it 5 stars however for 2 reasons--1st--false advertising--on the cover of the game it advertises ""Pirates Dice"" with a picture of black decaying dice with white dots, yet, you get the normal white dice with black dots in the game. Also, you are supposed to build docks and harbors instead of houses and hotels, yet, there are the normal house and hotel pieces to put on your property--all in all just saying that these little things would have really tied the whole thing together."
3,They seem fine,"I bought these for Brian who free dives and spear fishes. He says they work fine, although a bit on the light side and no protection on the fingers. The finger tips will probably wear through quickly on these, because they are not reinforced. These might be fine for light recreational use, but I wouldn't recommend them for pulling lobster out of holes."
3,An avid reader,I found this novel hard to get into but about half way through it does get better. I really enjoy the Stone Barrington novels so was expecting this one to be on a par with those. I didn't think this one measured up.
3,When passion is stronger than revenge...,"One day Lazaro Herrera willg et revenge on Dante, his half-brother, who received all the love and opportunities from their father that he was denied. When Dante's sister-in-law Zoe arrives in Argentina, LAzaro sees his change for revenge.But Lazaro hasn't counted on Aoe's blong, blue-eyed beauty and the powerful sexual magnetism that smolders between them. Will his plan for revenge fall apart or can he still go through with it and deny his own happiness?"
5,Best RUSSIAN Cd,"""Kisa Kisa"" is Misha Shufutinsky's best album. The first 11 songs including ""2 Candles"" and ""Jewish Taylor"" are very popular Russian songs that everybody loves. Another great album is the 1998 release ""Odnazhdi V'Ameriki"". Look for it and enjoy this album."
1,fallen off badly...,"Beatnuts first EP ""Intoxicated Demons"" and their subsequent debut LP ""Street Level"", plus all the guest production they did around the same time (Down South, Kurious, Pete Nice + Daddy Rich, Chi-Ali etc) was all classic, and pretty much up there with anything else from the time. Their 2nd LP ""Stone Crazy"" was nice but not as good as the first. ""Take It Or Squeeze It"" though is just a wack album. Psycho Les and JuJu were never lyrical masters so I wouldn't judge a Beatnuts album on lyrical content, but the beats are so boring on this, it's unreal. I managed to listen to this once.If you get a Beatnuts album, get ""Street Level""."
5,defining,the defining point of music for the 1990's. anything after is merely trying to emulate. dance music-all from this record. oasis- you wish you could do a song that could be on the b-side.nuff said
1,Not as pictured.,"This item is junk. Not classic at all. Very difficult to open, printed copy of label taped on can crooked. Would not recommend!!!"
5,"A fascinating study, suddenly timely again","With the volunteer military facing staffing problems, and with the first tentative trial balloons about restoring the draft being lofted, this book offers insight into a fascinating alternative. The Swiss system is superior to a lottery-based conscript army because it encompasses everyone, not just the unlucky and the young. That not only makes it fairer, but provides protection for democratic values against the standing professional army that the Framers feared. Read this book together with Gary Hart's excellent book ""The Minuteman: Restoring an Army of the People"" (Free Press 1998), which argues for a Swiss-style approach in America."
4,Very good 5-bike carrier,"I needed a bike rack for all of the family bikes, and this one fits the bill nicely. Very easy to assemble, and although a bit heavy to lift, easily slides onto the 2 inch receiver hitch and quickly bolted into place. For bikes that have a high crossbar (ie. men's bike), the bike is easily placed into the cradles and strapped into place. For bikes without the cross bar (ie. kid's bikes and women's bike), I recommend purchasing the removable crossbars (available at my local bike shop for $35, but likely cheaper on-line). Finagling all five bikes onto the rack isn't so easy, but it will work. The features of the rack are very nice: bars drop-down when not needed and the whole rack drops away from the vehicle for easy access to the rear door of the minivan. For the money, a great buy!"
1,The movie was great but the disc was horrible,"The disc froze solid just 8mins/16seconds into the movie. Tried playing it in both my DVD players, PS3 and X-Box 360, had to clean the disc many times (about 10). Finally got to the end of the movie almost 4 hours after I first tried watching it."
3,just o.k.,"My Sister-in-law has this product and she said it was great. She lives 5 minutes from me, but I get static with my music about 40% of the time. I've attempted every radio station in its range and can't seem to get it to come in clear.I would suggest spending the money on a high quality one if you can, if not then this will work ok"
1,Tom Hanks' Sensitive Gangster Can't Carry This Stinker,"I knew it was a bad sign when I kept glancing at the DVD timer while watching this. The pacing of the film is so incredibly slow that a person can take extended bathroom or snack breaks, leave the film playing, and not miss substantive plot developments. After the first hour, I know I did!Hanks' sensitive gangster is about the only glimmer of interest in this otherwise lackluster film that is so in love with its visuals that it forgets to include more than a rudimentary plot. A forgettable film in many respects."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This is one of those movies I wish I had rented. NOT a keeper. Some of the 20's period cinematography was pretty but not worth a movie on the small screen. Wish I had caught it in the theater, been mildly disappointed and not bought the DVD. Kinda boring movie."
4,Well Done,"Very fine movie about a man seeking revenge against his fellow gangsters for killing his family. Also, it is very much about a father's relantionship with his son. Tom Hanks is very effective as the Irish mob hitman. You can truly believe he is this great family guy, but also that he is capable of doing such terrible things. Paul Newman also is very good in his role as the boss. Well crafted and directed. Check out the original graphic novel of the same name by Max Allan Collins if you would like to see the differance from paper to screen."
2,wrong role,Mr.Hanks seems as if he can only play pathetic oversensitive characters anymore.The story was great but using Hanks for this gangster role was somewhat akin to having Henry Fonda or Alan Alda play 'Scarface'.
5,Very good movie and very good picture!,I very appreciate this film in Blu-ray! I will recommande to all my friends! And I will see this movie again!
3,review for Road to Perdition,"The Road to Perdition was a marvelous movie with the exceptional cinematography. I must say it had a violent theme but nonetheless the beauty of the way it was crafted, was extraordinary. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job but felt that he was out of character for this movie. His presence gave a new perspective of the movie. One can say that he made the movie more complex then what was needed. Overall the movie is good to see one time but do not buy. It is not a masterpiece like the godfather series due to the simplistic story line. Laconically the plot was bad but the movie as a whole was okay."
1,This Movie Sucked,The movie had a good message but I expected more. The entire movie took place in a court room. All you saw were the lawyers interviewing different individuals to see if carl payne was worthy of going to heaven. The movie was really boring and did not hold my attention.
1,falls apart quick,"had this for about a week before the paint started chipping off and stones started coming off. by the second week the clasps that hold the cover on by the sides broke off and now it's not usable at all. as cheap as it is, l still expected it last a little longer than it did."
5,GREAT MOISTURIZER,"I am an esthetician and highly recommend this moisturizer for anyone that is 50+ with dry skin, especially good for those with rosacea or psoriasis. The price is right for what it does. Skin is noticeably hydrated within days. My 87 year old mother in law has me send this to her every 3 mos. She loves it as her over all daily moisturizer."
5,Best ever!,After trying hooked on Phonics (which is completely backward) my son is thriving on this program...He has turned from a reading hater to loving it. I could not be more impressed. I love all the materials and when you open the box for the first time the joy of seeing everything inside is exciting. A++++++++++++
1,Vague and Weak,"Of all the Economics textbooks I've ever used (and there have been many!) this has to be the worst. The content is watered down, inaccurate, and vague. Instead of laying a fundamental basis for further economic study, this textbook presents a wishy-washy definition-oriented primer to econo-speak, nothing more. Simplification _is_ to be expected in an intro text, but simplification taken as fact is misleading, and ignoring some topics (utility, for example) while explaining others without any context (business cycles, for example) is just counterproductive! Perhaps Parkin should've spent less time making this book pretty, left out the color tables, and inserted some real content!"
1,Strange little movie,"I love St. Therese and have read her autobiography, letters, and poems. Unfortunately, this movie does not do justice to Therese. At times, the movie is kind of creepy, paying undue attention to a lesbian nun in love with Therese. This nun is almost the co-star of the movie. It seems to me that the film maker is critical of Therese and the Carmelites. This is not a movie for children in particular, because it would only confuse them. Actually, it would probably confuse anyone. What a shame. The movie gets 1 star only because of good acting by the woman who plays Therese. The movie has other faults, but I'll not dwell on them because its really not worth it."
1,Just another hateful film against the a Catholic Saint,"Anyone who has read 'the Story of a Soul' knows that St. Therese was not a neurotic 'basketcase', as this film would have you beleive. This film is just another cheap shot at Catholic bigotry and I think 1 star is far too generous a rating for it.Read and reread the book but don't waste your money on a film like this."
2,Too many fantasies.,"The acting by Catherine Mouchet was very good; otherwise, this film contains too many inaccuracies, particularly too many fantasies about masochism and sadism that do not appear at all in any of the many books that I have read about St. Therese of Lisieux."
4,It's great to be unusual,"Was I surprised to see anything by Gruppo Sportivo available on CD after all these years. I bought their stuff on LP. I am one of the few Americans who probably did. This has a few songs that I know such as ""Blah Blah Magazines,"" which pokes fun at tabloids and ""Mission A Paris,"" the only song I ever heard any radio stations play by them in my area. What happened to ""What Happened to Romance?"" Fun collection."
3,Mixed reviews. Great for slower long walks.,"I purchased this stroller to make my neighborhood walks with my son easier. I like that the front will unlocks and of course my son loves the toy. I also like that he can sit a little more upright than in jogging stollers and the baby cup & toy bar is a great feature. Generally it seems to be a smooth ride for my son and easier to push than a normal stroller. I have had a few problems with the stroller. I am a very fast walker. If I walk too fast the stroller shakes like it is going to come apart. Also I am only 5'2, but if I walk too fast I end up kicking the brake bar at the bottom. I've used the stroller for a few weeks now and I'm already noticing alot of sweaking. Also, not a big deal, but the mirror that comes with it is pointless. Every time I put it on there my son reaches for it to play with it and it comes off."
1,Don't waste your money,This hat is not worth the amount they are charging for itwhen I got this hat I tried it on the top of the hat the material is so thing you can see day lightInstead of wasting money to return I just put it in the trash can.*I used a gift card to purchase this item.
5,Carly Simon Moonlight Serenade,"Carly hasn't skipped a beat in 30 plus years. I started listening to her when my son was a newborn, and he is now 33. The songs on this album are some of the best in the American songbook, the instrumentals are wonderful, and Carly's voice has that same magic, smoky quality that she has been known for for over a generation.This music will make you want to dance and lift your spirits, exactly what really good music is supposed to do!"
5,Growing Up,"When I first started to listen to this album I thought of the younger Carly and I was slight slightly disapointed. Then I decided to listen to the album,really listen with no prejudice and I find the album (like someone before me said) AMAZING!Carly at 60 you can still amaze me.And to the buyers who think that it is trash,where do you live? I'll come and pick it up."
4,"Carly Is Still Very Good, But...","These are great songs from the golden era of American popular music. They deserve to be recorded with top notch pop/jazz musicians, utilizing the very best available recording techniques and equipment, and these ""cuts"" nearly meet such criteria. But Carly's voice is showing its age at times on this recording, and she seems to be pulled along by these great songs at times (rather then leading the music with high confidence.) Also the musical arrangements do not show a great deal of imagination or the highest levels of artistry. But the greatness of the compositions (and perhaps memories associated with these songs) make this CD worth its price."
2,Feel like I am getting old.,"The overwhelming sense I got from listening to this disk is of one of the chior ladies at church singing along with a Karioki disk. The choice of songs is great, as are the arrangements. But Carly Simon's voice seems so tired and shakey. She has never had a great range, but the smoothness of her delivery just was not there for me on most of the songs. I have been waiting for this disk to come out and so it was a big disappointment."
4,Could Have Been a Lot Better,"I've been a huge fan of Carly Simon ever since there was a Carly Simon. I'm also a huge fan of the standards. I should have been in love with this CD. I'm not. On her earlier My Romance, the production was solid, straightforward and unencumbered. Carly's voice was clear, clean and pure Carly. Moonlight Serenade is slick and over produced. Carly takes her voice out of range a couple times and it sounds as if someone else's voice was inserted for a word or two. On Moonlight Serenade, Carly tries too hard. She tries to do clever things with her voice and as much as I love Carly's singing, she does not have a clever voice. (Benchmarks: Madeleine Peyroux and the ""new"" Diana Krall have clever voices. Norah Jones does not.) Don't get me wrong, I've listened to the CD twice since receiving it yesterday. I'll listen to it a lot more. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed. It could have been a lot better. Bottom line: Moonlight Serenade - 4 stars; My Romance - 5."
1,boring,"I watched about an hour of this movie, and it took place in one room the WHOLE ENTIRE TIME. All they did was talk and smoke pot. It may get better, but in order to hook me, a movie needs to be interesting within the first thirty minutes. Ya'll want a ghetto drama, cop the classic Boyz-N-The-Hood, or Above da Rim. I be out."
3,sports watch,"This watch is quite functional, OK looking, but is not as user friendly as other sports watches. As for keeping time it seems to gain a about 15 seconds a week."
1,I wish it was longer,I got this game when my mom and I were spending time together. I wish I had not bought it. It's a waste of money. I finished it in a couple of hours and I'll never play with it again. It's maybe more for 4 year olds not 8 years old like me.
5,"Ragge describes ""that element"" perfectly","12 step recovery is not entirely a hoax, however there is ""that element"". Don't be fooled... ""that element"" is dangerous! It is a form of psychological coercion which is far from the ""freedom"" indicated in ""the promises"". Thank you Ken, you have done a great service for many alcoholics/addicts who sit in 12 step meetings, knowing that something doesn't feel quite right, but aren't yet able to put a name to it. You've hit the nail right on the head with your analysis, and I'm sure many people will be better able to steer clear of the brain poison that is adrift in the meeting rooms."
1,Pathetic Godless Nonsense,A complete waste of time. This guy is one of Trimpey's mind numbed robots. Writen from a complete lack of understanding of the subject this book is laughable. This is part of an effort to wrest treatment of alcoholism away from 12-step spiritual awakening programs and hand it over to the cult of secular psychology.
1,This book is an irrational look at 12-Step Programs,"Even though AA is not without fault, this book does fail to present an objective view that includes the good things that can come out of AA and 12-Step programs.To deny that adiction is partly a phylosophical/spiritual problem compounds to the problem when trying to recover from it.Most of the problems described are not inherent to the 12-Step program but to the way it gets implemented in some areas.A more rational look at the AA and 12-Step programs would have been able to point out its strengths, together with what makes sense and does not make sense about AA."
1,Ragging on Ragge's Rag,"There was once a carpenter who tried to build a house. He constructed a structure that was not to his liking--so he blamed his tools. In his own mind he was not capable of fault, so of course the problem must lie with the tools.Ken Ragge is such a carpenter. His imagination is at least as limited as is his tool kit. All persons who come through the doors of AA meetings are not exactly the same. Obviously many lives have been changed, even saved, by the working of the 12 Steps of AA. The disappointment of some does not mean the experience of others is a hoax.This book will let anyone who needs it find permission to wiggle off the hook of a hard look at the self. Read this book with glee if you are one of those who need to find reasons to avoid the hard and painful work of facing and working for the needed changes in yourself.Not a balanced treatment at all."
1,Yet another complaint,I'll add my complaint to the others who find that bundling Cold Comfort Farm with another movie I don't want is stupid!
3,Fun idea could be made a little better,"My son bought this with some birthday money from his grandfather. It is a neat concept. My son and the neighbor kids enjoy it both boys and girls. The only problem is the plastic clips on the vests broke the very first time they tried to put them on,on both vests.Now they are safety pinned.This is a entertaining idea but, for 31.99 it could have been made a little better."
1,poor sound quality,"Not as promised in its user's manual, ""Excellent clarity of sound. No background hum or static"". Actually it has strong hum when talking, but quiet when not using.It is suggested to use to monitor nursery or sick room. But it needs loud sound to trigger the ""auto talk"" function."
4,Skagen Women's 271SSLB,"Great product, I like the quality, it is thin, light and very comfortable to ware daily. i would definitely recommend it!"
2,good but....,"This book is good but I felt that it misses the mark. Like other dating books it covers common sense advice like ""avoid dating a non Christian, be mature in your relationship with Christ before entering a romantic relationship."" etc.The author presents charts throughout the book on how a romantic relationship should follow. No offense but there is no such thing as a formulaic way to go about relationships, and its ridiculous to actually think that dating is a sin or ""disease.""Yes, I agree there are a lot of problems in dating but its not like ""courting"" is more holy or more safe. There will be problems with romantic relationships no matter what they want to call it. So while I agree there is a lot of smart advice in this book, I wouldn't recommend it.Life doesn't follow formulas and charts. There are better books out there like ""Boundaries in Dating"" and ""When God Writes Your Love Story."" I liked them a whole lot better than this book."
2,Not for beginners.,"If one is just starting to learn astral projection, DO NOT use this book as a sole source of learning. It seemed to me that this book was more about what one can do in the astral plane and the options available, rather than on projection techniques. The only method of projection that the author mentions is one of the least successful (for beginners). To sum it all up: read it for interest in the astral plane, not for learning astral projection."
1,Don't Bother,"I am the kind of person who loves to keep every book she buys, and can find something in almost every book that is useful, no matter how bad the book. This book is one of the extreme few that I found no value in. If you are looking for meditative visualizations, then you might actually enjoy this book. Visualizations are the only thing this book contains. Whether or not they will be helpful to you is another question. I personally found them to be of no use as I can create my own visualization scripts -- and personal creation is almost always more effective than depending on someone else's ideas.I was looking for techniques on astral projection to add to my current practices. Unfortunately, this book is devoid of any such techniques. I ended up spending money on something that offered no help, and wasn't even entertaining as fiction. If you are serious about astral projection, please look elsewhere -- you'll be sorely disappointed here."
2,Very overrated Lincoln biography!!!,"I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did."
2,An Answer wont be found here....,"This album is completely opposite from the style that made them what they are. The only song on this cd thats even slightly similar in comparison to the style of infiltrate destroy rebuild or Volume 1 is Dressed in Decay....other than that the cd has a totally different sound.If your expecting more of what made them great, dont look here.Most every track has a 'pop' mainstream sound to them.The lyrics are incredibly weak, and are nothing in comparison to IDRAlso the general recording of the cd isnt very well done.Best tracks: Dressed in Decay, Familiar Realm sort of....thats about it."
4,"Great effort, worth the $$$.","in many ways this is CKY's finest album. but in some ways, it is not. i think they spread themselves a bit thin, trying to get too technical. sometimes less is more. also i think the lyrics/vocals are the weakest link. now i am a big fan of CKY, and i expect a lot. it is a great album and i'm glad i bought it, but if i had to pick one... ""Infiltrate Destroy Rebuild"" is their best work."
4,Buen libro de consulta.,Buen libro de aprendizaje y consulta. Está muy completo y abarca todas las técnicas de rearmonización clásicas en el Jazz.
1,Avoid this TV !,"I bought this model from Circuit City, when they were still around. Within four months had to have numerous service calls while it was still under warranty. Replaced the lamp, after out of warranty. But the worst, of the worst I got the white dot problem on this TV. It starts with one dot on the screen and then multiplies to thousands of white dots on your screen. Samsung has horrible, horrible customer service. They will not help you. I battled for many months with Samsung and they were horrid to work with. I will never, ever buy anong Samsung product. Avoid this model, like the plague !"
4,6 months in,"Compared to my old Panasonic 53"" projection the picture is a dream, but it's quirky. Had the Blue Halos fixed, does have rainbow effect on bright light sources, screen is bowed up about 1/2"" at the top right, the occasional crackling from the case is very disconcerting. Twice it has refused to turn on - unplugging ""reset"" or whatever and then it worked. Hooking up the PC through the HDMI cable is fine, but through VGA it gets some not supported error. The sound sucks unless you turn bass way down, price you pay for compactness.Compares favorably picture-wise to friends smaller high end LCD's for nearly half the price - for the $1800 its really hard to beat the value for a 61"". If it lasts a couple years until the next latest greatest thing i'll be happy"
1,Real nice picture -FOR A FEW YEARS,Got the deadly 'white spot' problem after less than 4 years of use. Samsung was next to useless in helping me - and only gave me back less than $200 on a $2000 TV - and that was only after bunches of calls and a personal letter to the President of the company. Bye Bye Samsung.
3,Great Picture !! Too bad it only lasted four days....,"Great Picture, but after four days the LCD circuit board blew. Part is on back order and will take seven days to get. OUCH! I will say Samsung Service Dept. was very friendly and within three days had a Repair Rep.out to diagnose the problem. Will give more feed back when T.V. is fixed on Thur."
3,"the good, the bad and ????",The set looks good and the picture is excellent BUT!!!!! THE SET QUITS RESPONDING TO THE REMOTE AFTER ONE HOUR (SOMETIMES LESS) OF OPERATION.Customer service is difficult and their certified service shops are worse. Requested service on Feb 15 and am still waiting (scheduled for 28th). Questionable quality. Hope this isn't what the future holds.
5,Stunning picture. Just one drawback with HDMI audio.,"There's no need to repeat the other comments on the display quality; this TV is stunningly good, especially with a high-quality over-the-air HD signal (such as some of PBS's content).There is, however, one major disappointment with the Samsung's optical audio output--the audio portion of the HDMI signal's (cable box, DVD player, etc.) input is not sent through the TV's optical audio output. This means that you will need to run a separate digital audio cable from the HDMI source into your home theater receiver to get Dolby Digital 5.1 or above; plus, you'll need to manually switch your receiver for the corresponding audio source. (By the way, the lack of optical audio output from HDMI is confirmed in a chart on page 37 of the Samsung manual.)Perhaps (I just don't know) the more expensive HL-T6189S, which advertises HDMI 1.3 (unlike the HL-T6187S) would solve this problem."
5,Great store great price great tv.,i must comment on amazon they stocked this tv. shipped it to me in less than a week. shipping company wouldnt carry it upstairs aawwwww too heavy for them whatever. me and my small wife managed to cary it upstairs without even breaking a sweat.the tv however is awsome.in hdtv mode and dvd and ps3 mode it is breathtakingly beautifull. regular tv thru satalite is ok but not near as good as hdtv signals. so hdtv is probably a must. i currently am using a antenna and picking up about 20 hdtv channels free. there all good.one other thing i noticed is the tv defaults to dynamic color mode. i found this mode looked distorted to me. switched it to movie mode and im in love with the picture quality. so play with your settings and get this tv a good clean signal and be amazed at the picture.
5,"Great TV, Great price","I waited and researched it to death, then bit the bullet in Jan. Satisfied ever since. No halos, no ghosting, no haze, no problems with remote....nothing. Watched ""Deadliest Catch"" on HD for the first time last night....thought I was going to get some dramamine. We had some miscues with the delivery, but found it was my fault as I had not updated our new phone number on our profile. Have not had a 1080p source hooked up yet, looking forward to that."
1,RVhusker,"Another toy that had to be returned, missing parts, poor condition, basically should have been advertised as parts for collecter"
2,Not worth the money,"While my grandson and son had a lot of fun with it for a week, it completely fell apart within the first week. The heads on the fighting figures completely broke off and cannot be repaired. This toy is definitely not worth the money."
5,40 Years and so much has changed,Beautifully crafted writing about 3 encounters between David Brower and antagonists of the environmental movement of the 1960's/70's. Illustrates that political conflict does not have to be personal.
4,thought provoking,Interesting stories that force you to consider both sides of several important environmental issues. Solid writing. Even more interesting because the stories are true.
4,Encounters with the Archdruid,"David Brower is a major conservationist who leads many environmental groups. In Encounters with the Archdruid, Brower travels to a mountain, an island, and a river, and has battles with various developers in each of the aareas. In the mountains, he encounters Charles Park, a geologist who is pick-happy. ON the island, he meets Charles Fraser, a developer who wants to build a resort on the island. He also goes fafting with Floyd Dominy, who is bent on building a dam to make a lake out of the end of the river. Brower winds some, and loses some, but for the sake of the enfironment, he never gives up."
4,Know what you are doing.,"The iBook is def. not the worst computer. You should first get to know how to use it before freaking out on user comments. To display Thai, your iExpl. needs a plug-in. And why not try Safari Browser for a change. You must search for the free RealPlayer One more accuratly there is a link to the free version for Mac OS also, it's just not as ovious as the pay version (which is no dough because Real Media wants to make money off of their software). An I book comes with AppleWorks, thats Apples version of Office, so to speak(write). It can Import Word files as far as I know. I think that should solve your problems."
2,Not so elegant,To the point. I used to like this album so I purchased it on CD.Great guitar playing but it sounds so dated! Spinal Tap jazz fusion rock...yuck.
2,Belgian Greyhound pet comb is the only one to get,"I have tried many pet combs for grooming my long-haired cat. Cheap ones (like this one) aren't worth the money. The teeth bend and break easily--take a close look at the photo of this brand new one for an example. But the worst part is that they just don't work well. Do a bit of searching and you will find an expensive ($20+) Greyhound comb that is FAR superior and will last you a lifetime. You want only the original one made in Belgium. Talk to any professional groomer, they will all tell you the same thing. Unfortunately, this Belgian made comb is not available in typical retail pet outlets because most people refuse to shell out over $20 for just a comb. Also, look out for imitations. You do not want a Greyhound ""style"" comb, you want only the real thing. Good luck in your search. Your cat will love you for it!"
5,The Incomparable Bogdan,"What can I say about Bogdan Raczynski? Each time I listen to one of his releases, I am amazed at the melodic, rhythmic, and emotional power which exists in each one of his compositions. Combining harsh drum beats, beautiful melodies and bass lines, samples from Japanese films, and his signature vocals (featured more prominently on this album than on his previous release, the fabulous Boku Mo Wakaran), Bogdan constructs his pieces to move you physically and mentally. If you are unsure if you'll like this album, buy it and blast it. If you don't like it then, listen to it again. Like many Aphex Twin albums, Samurai Math Beats really grows on you. Each time I put it on, it gets better. Bravo to Bogdan for this wonderful, genre-defying release."
4,If you fear truth don't read this book (or maybe you should),"Please disregard any negative reviews of this book. Anyone discrediting what this man says obviously doesn't get it!The anger that it appears to generate in some people speaks louder than any review. He cannot upset you. Only you can.Ironicaly this is the limited type of thinking that Satyam is attempting to expose as a waste of time.If you read this with your heart, you will see that he does not say that practice is a waste of time. Practice is the required method to soften the layers of human conditioning. The only time wasted is practicing while not realizing that you are the source of your own enlightenment. It is not a ""thing"" you need to seek because is is already in you.If repetition bothers you, pretend the book is one long chanting session and let joy overflow every time he says ""You are That""."
3,Low on power- not impressed.,Like other reviewers I only paid a dollar for this item so it is hard to complain. The vacuum lacks sufficient power and suction to do much - I had hoped to use it to lift cat hair from furniture and stairs but it doesn't have adequate suction. I will probably put it in next garage sale!
4,Worth a second read - buy two.,"""Soul Food"" is a joy to read. Recently I have read the wonder-filled and inspiring ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" which reminded me of Kornfield and Feldman's and so I returned to it for a second time. Both these books should be brought down from the shelf when the sun goes down - extend daylight without putting your hydro bill up!. I had forgotten what pleasure I found in first reading Soul food."
3,Good at best If ya Like em,"The first track alone makes this a must have for avid fans. However because of the high Import price for so few songs many will be deterred. If you are new to Kula Shaker it would be advisable to go for one of their more popular CDs such as K or Peanuts, Pigs & Astronauts. Though the Hush (Track 1) is worth selling your grandmother for, listeners may feel let down by the remainder of the CD. For example tracks like Gokula and Hay Dude are found on Summer Sun and K, in fact the only unheard songs on the CD are Hush and The Leek. However if you can live with that and expect very little you will be pleased with this purchase because although the songs are few, they are very good."
2,Isaac's Storm wannabe,"I hate books like this. The author didn't have enough faith in her story-telling ability to simply tell a great story instead of pretending that it was worse than it was. It was a terrible hurricane, yes. It was not, however, the worst hurricane ever. The reader can tell that she did some research on hurricanes in general, yet she makes not a single mention of the 1900 Galveston hurricane in which over 6000 people perished. It is impossible for her not to know about Galveston; in fact, I have an ungenerous hunch that she modeled this book after Isaac's Storm, Erik Larsen's account of the Galveston hurricane. Minor quibble: Her insistence on giving the storm a catchy name, ""GH38"", is grating.On the plus side, I did like the way she connected the storm to the great Depression on one side and World War II on the other."
4,Thr Great Storm,"I enjoyed the book for it's insight, would have liked to see more of the actual photos. It was well written and brought back memories of the storm."
3,A big blow,"An interesting read about a storm that is largely forgotten. Not as good a ""Issacs Storm"" although the same subject matter. I felt it was thin as a story and would have been a good magazine article."
3,Turns feet black,"Usually my feet stray off of flip-flops toward the inside, but the pretty and plentiful straps on these Tevas keep my feet in the correct place. They're also extremely comfortable - nice and squishy. Unfortunately, they also turn the bottoms of my feet BLACK and the discoloration doesn't come off easily - it takes some scrubbing with soap and a washcloth. These flip-flops would get 5 stars if it weren't for that."
4,comfy sandals,"These are really cute shoes and comfortable. The straps can be a tad bothersome until they are broken in a little and stretched to conform with your foot, but it didn't take much time to do that. I have a couple of pairs and really like the way they look on my feet."
5,Extremely Comfortable Flip Flops!!,"For years flip flips have caused my feet, ankles, knees, hips & back to ache if I wear them too long or do much walking in them. These flip flops have great support and the higher straps keep my feet from working so hard as I walk. I have been very pleased with them and will definitely purchase again when it's time to replace the ones I have now."
4,"runs large, not small",I wear a 9 1/2 so I ordered a size 10 instead of the 9 based on other reviews that said these sandals run small and you need to order larger. WRONG. I am swimming in the 10s and will have to return/exchange them for a size 9. They do feel like they would be comfortable if only they weren't so big.
5,So pleased,"I just received these sandals yesterday and when I first tried them on, I thought they were a bit big, but after wearing them today, they fit perfectly. I generally wear a 6 in flats and in my Chaco sandals, but I listened to the other reviews and went for a 7 and am so glad that I did. They are so comfortable and I think I may like them better than my Chacos that I wore all summer long while walking around China. I highly recommend these sandals, but definitely go a size up."
3,size not true,"The shoes looked as I expected and are very durable; however, the sizing runs very small. I ordered an 8 and they were too small and too tight."
5,IN LOVE!!,"I am in LOVE with these shoes. I bought a different pair a year ago and have worn them into the ground so I had to get myself another pair. These are the only shoes I will buy because they are so comfortable. Unless it's snowing outside, you can guarantee I have these on my feet!"
5,Not Your Standard Flip Flop!,I've been looking for some inexpensive sandals for the summer but I usually don't wear flip flops because I have high arches and they hurt my feet. I am sooo glad I came across these sandals! They are so cushy AND they have some arch support!! I normally wear an 8 1/2 shoe so I did get a 9 because of what other reviewers recommended and they fit great. I LOVE these sandals and plan to get some more:)
5,Love these!,I bought these based solely on reviews from this site. I was not disappointed at all. I went from winter and boots and high end sneakers because of back problems to a vacation in Hawaii. I lived in these sandals all week and had no issues with comfort or my back. The arch support does work.
2,Straps come loose,"This Teva style looks pretty nice for a flip flop. The strap configuration is the whole thing, the only thing I can see that distinuishes it from a $1.99 drugstore version.The third time I wore mine, the strap on one came loose. This means the main strap over the foot that holds the sandal on slipped out of its mooring 1/2 or 3/4 inch, from where it connects to the body of the shoe. I was just walking down a cement sidewalk with my dog.From that moment, the whole shoe is much too loose, and easy to trip with. Insecure. And the whole reason I chose this style was to have a more secure flip flop on my feet.I just could not face writing the company and shipping it back and paying $5 more to return an $18 item. Would not buy again. Disappointed in Teva."
4,Provides a solid overview of JDE,"The book provides a great background for the JDE newcomer. The book has sections that are good for the executive sponsor and transitions into detail good for those actually integrating. While not something that would ensure a successful implementation, the book covers a significant number of key issues and risks that should help companies through the implementation process."
5,Love to read,This is a wonderful book. Jane Feather is a fantastic writer and this book shows compassion and warmth. I just could not put it down. Love this book.
3,Tasty scraps,"3 1/2Interesting collection of outtakes will only be for those already heavily invested into modes of Miles due to a sometimes rambling nature, but for those it caters to many of these scratches at excellence do well, in easy-going, carefree fashion, at chronicling one of the modern ages most influential musicians in one of his most transitionary phases."
3,Great stories - Publisher should meet one of the fates,"This book has such incredible potential but the typographical, grammatical, and fact errors make it unbelievably annoying to read. It's like it was written by a sixth grader without a spell check. According to the book, Lee Harvey Oswald's assassin was Jack Rugby. I'll leave it at that. Let's just say that the publisher should meet one of the fates mentioned in the book."
3,The Rock Physics Handbook Review,"The book works well as a reference, but contains only cursory examinations of some topics. Governing and consistutive equtions are comprehensively included in the text. Worth the expense."
4,I like it,"I really like the pepper grinder, but the salt doesn't come out very well. I might have to make the holes a bit larger."
1,Shallow and ignorant,"A silly book. Shows great ignorance of Christian teaching, scripture, and philosophy. A modernist through and through."
4,Short but good.,"As other reviewers have noted, much of the value of this book is its extensive list of film noir titles. The reviews, though quite brief, are well-written. Some problems with the formatting have created inappropriate hyphens."
3,Good story/bad translation,"I was looking forward to this book because I knew of Mulisch's history and reputation. The protagonist is unable to avoid confronting a traumatic night during World War Two, and finds himself unwittingly drawn back to that night, and confronting the complexity of moral issues that emerge from his discoveries. In this way, The Assault resembles The Reader and Out Stealing Horses, both of which are very well translated. Unfortunately, The Assault is poorly rendered and doesn't live up to its potential."
5,Interesting,this book was tottaly amazing. It had every feeling and it felt like i was there in the second world war. a definte book to look into for the Mulisch-lovers.
5,Just Amazing,"Last year in english class this was the last book we had to read. It was amazing. Mulisch draws the reader into the book with amazing skill, slowing bringing the reader into a spirrial of consindences and chance meetings.It follows the story of a biy called Anton, towards the end of the war a important official is killed outside his house. It takes the reader through the rest of his life and although Anton attepmted to forget, the past kept coming up until he discoved the truth about what happend.This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. I would recomend it to anyone."
5,The best in Content & Size,"I purchased this book on the advice of a professor in 1977. I have used it constantly inover twenty years of ministry. Mr. Pardington is able to OUTLINE a complex doctrine ina small amount of space, and give you supporting source materials from the master writer of days gone by. Knowing Christian doctrine is the beginning of being able to say one knows and understands the Bible. This is bombastic statement, but one which seems easier to utter after using George Pardington's monumental work. My only regret is that for it's small size (mine was dark blue-hardback) it is rather easy tomisplace and I have, much to my chagrin."
4,rain poncho,"This is a good poncho, fits well and perfectly usable. The only reason I didn't give five stars is one of the seams wasn't stitched when it arrived. It was simple to stitch up, though."
4,M-Audio IE10 in ear phones,"An excellent choice for me. Not quite as nice the Shure EC3s I have been using but a little less in cost and a lot more sturdy in construction. I had to return 2 pairs of Shure's due to breakdown and flimsy build. My one beef would be the selection of ""bungs"" that came with them. A softer, more flexible material would be better and more comfortable. Great sound, great isolation, I like the way the wires go over the ears to minimize cable knocking and maintain a secure fit. Another fine M-Audio product"
4,Lot's of fun.,Very nice kit. Only amplifier was oscillating. Just place the extra provided capacitor over powerconnection of IC and over the input of the IC and ground a resistor of 10 Kohm and all is OK. It is a lot of fun to build the radio and reception is above expectation.
4,AM/FM Radio Kit,"This product can neatly packaged with well written instructions. I have built kits before, but this one contained testing instructions that are done during the building phase. If you like to build small projects, this kit is an ideal project to fill that need."
5,This is an outstanding book that I couldn't put down!,"At a crossroads in his life, Rodolfo Medina remembers the year he was 14, a time of turmoil and change, not only for him but also for his family and friends. A Los Angeles barrio is the people caught between two cultures, neither of setting for this witty novel about which offers welcome."
1,Inaccuracies verging on intentional lies,"Capt cherry-picks tidbits of information to create his fanciful history, ignoring a vast body of evidence that contradicts his tale. This is revisionist nonsense invented solely to heal his bruised spiritual sensibility. Read at your own risk..."
1,WHAT the hell was that????,"I don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about. This story makes no sense whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, it starts off with a promising plot, and keeps it going until about halfway though. Then, it dives into complete nonsense. I love horror novels and have enjoyed the majority of the books by this author, but this one doesn't hack it. The story dissolves into unrelated flashes of sub plots that never quite tie together. And the end???? It makes no sense whatsoever. It seems like the author got tired of the story around page 200 and just sort of threw something together to get it to the publisher. The plot is forgotten and the story suffers greatly from it. If possible, I would give this novel zero stars."
4,Better than most,My son is 20 months and can't get these off the door unless they're not on correctly. If the door slams on the nob it'll fall off.
2,Cheap N' Cheesey,"The Case Logic brand CD case is much better for a few dollars more.This one is flimsy, and looks and feels cheap."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Aliens invade earth. They are warlike, elephantine looking creatures with their own strange hierarchy of dominance and submission.They take captives for study, and some of these ordinary people are able to learn enough about what goes on to help humanity turn the tables.This is after a lot of fighting, death, and the nuking of the odd United State."
4,One of the coolest games made!!!!,"This game is the coolest !!! i havent played it yet but im wating for it come out on xbox or the pc. i saw it revewed on tech tv on xplay.you get to be a ghost and scare sim like charaters. you gain new spells to scare the sims. you get to go to a house , a manson , and camp ground i would give this game 5stars because it looks like th coolest games"
1,Complete disaster,I used 5.1 Truffle. My natural hair is dark brown but I wanted a hint of highlights without going too drastic on the change. I followed all the steps and applied the product as instructed. First my hair turned out VERY dark. I thought maybe the highlights (next step) would tone it down. NOT! The highlights turned orange and to make matters worse there wasn't enough mix for my medium length hair. So I don't know what they talk about that the mix is enough. Waste of money :(
2,Hair is partially ruined,"Before using this product I had never A) dyed my hair before (all over color) and B) had never colored my hair myself (I have always had highlights done in a salon). My hair color is naturally dishwater blonde and I was looking to ""freshen"" up the color and do my own blonde highlights cheaply and cover up some grays. After the first step (all over color) - I was happy with the color but it did not cover all of my grays. I had someone help me with the highlights and you couldn't even tell where we were putting the bleach. After rinsing that out - ONLY my roots were bleached. Now I literally have orangish/highlighter yellow ROOTS. The rest of my hair is fine but... fabulous. Now I have to go spend probably double than what I was trying to avoid - in a salon to fix this mess. I bought this product because all of the fabulous reviews and now I wish I would have never touched my hair :("
3,Beautiful color but the highlights are a pain to do by yourself,"I realize the accessories that are given in the box (the finger grip, the wand) are suppose to make it easy but it is not. My hand got so messy with dye that I had a hard time picking the peices that I wanted to highlight. Nice product and color but I prolly won't get again."
2,Formulation changed,"I have used Couleur Experte (5.1) for about 8 years now. It was always great. About 6 months ago or so the formulation changed. It used to take 30 minutes, now it takes 15 minutes. You should disregard any reviews for the old formulation. I can't tell any difference in color - that seems fine. But over the last several months the quality of my hair has become absolutely horrible, and I don't know what else I can blame. It's never been like this, frizzy looking, curling out of control, dry-looking. It looks severely unconditioned, but I'm using the same conditioner I have always used, including the conditioner that comes in the box. Has anyone else noticed this? I really wish I could go back to the old formulation for 6 months and see, but I can't."
5,Perfect!,"After the store I had been buying them at quit carrying them, I searched in every store I frequented and some I did not, for another good pair of moisturizing gloves. Then I searched all over the internet, and I was beginning to think I'd have to sew my own. Then I found Sephoras's gloves. They're perfect...a good fit, with just the right amount of stretch, and since I've had them for a while, I can tell you that they stand up to multiple washings very well. They're even better than the gloves I used to buy, and I was pleased with those, so that's saying a lot. Worth every penny."
3,Not that bad,"If you are taking a Geology class, this book is very helpful. Its easy to read, and has many pictures."
4,"Think Stephen King, but...","The story left a bad taste in my mouth, but I couldn't put it down. It gets the four stars for that alone. It reads like a Stephen King horror novel, but I have'nt felt like this after reading King -- perhaps with the exception of Gerald's Game. I wanted it to end differently, knowing all along it would end as it did. And, yeah, why didnt they just burn the vine (as another reviewer said)? A good read, but I wish I had never read it."
1,Yes - the ruins.,The artful way that the author was able to push this inconsequential item into 300+ pages accounts for the lonely star attached here.
1,All I can say is WOW (was that awful!),"I'll be pithy. I thought the book was terrible. I bought it based on the hype (I know, mistake #1)... live and learn. It's hard to articulate my distaste without giving away the plot (and I use this word loosely here). Simply put: the book is NOT scary. Rather, I found it to be absurd, lame, corny, pick an adjective. Smith is a good writer (A Simple Plan is a great novel) but this thing read like a rejected script for a bad teen horror flick. If you want a truly creepy book, read or re-read, Salem's Lot!"
1,I honestly don't see what the fuss was about.,"After seeing the promo for the movie, I read some of the reviews and bought the book, looking forward to a good read.I was completely disappointed. I could barely make myself finish the thing. I honestly don't see what the good reviews were about.How can they make a movie out of this? All they did was stand/sit around on a hill. I recommend this to no one."
4,"Brutal, gruesome, savage & loads of fun","Scott Smith's latest novel, ""The Ruins"" is a savage tale of a Mexican tourist excursion gone horribly bad. On the surface it is a very simple, straightforward tale that doesn't really get started till page 40 or so but once the tale is set in motion the novel achieves a tremendous forward momentum and readers will be hard pressed to put this book down (save for the occassional moment to catch ones breath) until the very end.Beneath the clear-cut storyline though, a richly layered psychological narrative takes place. The story is told through first-person perspective jumping through the viewpoints of 4 key characters - readers are given a very in-depth probe on how 4 unique personalities react when faced with an endless series of horrors and agonies. Ultimately it is the richness of these shifting, probing perspectives that add high value to what is already an engrossing and straightforward horror-thriller."
3,Great draft!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book because of Scott Smith, the review by Mr. King, and the mystery of the Maya Ruins. The book started out great and I couldn't put it down. I really liked the dynamic of the language barrier to add to the suspense of the plot. But I just kept waiting for some sort of back story to give meaning to the vine, or for someone to follow the different shafts in the abondoned mine more deeply, or especially to come across a 'ruin' at some point. I have to say that I felt a little short changed. It seemed like a great draft, but far from a complete novel. With that being said, I still liked the book and although dark, I really liked the ending as well. As Mr. King would say ""Ka is like a wheel"""
3,"Starts With a Bang, Ends With A Whimper","I was pulled right into the story, which is a good thing. And Smith's use of no-chapter-breaks really kept me involved for the first hundred pages or so......but then, I started to THINK. Something, it seems, which none of the characters in this novel do. I kept wondering: ""why are they doing THAT?"" And ""why are they going THERE?""To me, it seemed as if Smith envisioned the ending of this novel, and wrote backwards. Not because it made any sense, but because there was a preconceived notion of how the tale would end. So, the characters just keep doing things that infuriate and puzzle the reader.Most reviewers have given away most of the plot, but I won't do that here. Let's just say that this would be, at best, a ""B-Movie"" thriller.On the other hand, if you don't care much about characterization in your novels, the gore and thrill aspect MIGHT be enough to satisfy."
1,Waste of time,"I like to read all types of books, but this is a depressing waste of time. You know how its going to end one third of the way thru. It has no point to it."
2,Could have been a short story,"Although creating vivid characters with insightful psychology in the set-up, the book loses steam as the underlying menace is revealed, similar to Michael Crichton's 'Prey.' The set-up is great and doesn't take too long. But once the 'menace' (I'll avoid spoilers) is unveiled, it's capabilities seem unintentionally campy and, in several instances, inconsistent. All for the sake of creepy horror, you say? Well, it's ironic to me that Stephen King liked the book so much, because it really is an effort to -be- a Stephen King book. But it spends more time on character relationships and their fear, but doesn't deliver on the 'menace' in unexpected ways. The evil choice is filled with promise, but the execution sputters where it should creep."
2,This book reaffirms my stance not to read Fiction,"I echo most of the bad reviews of this book. Long, drawn-out, thin-plotted and predictable. When I got to the end, I was more and more worried that it would end the way it did, AND IT DID! Ugh.Reading fiction is a risky venture. You can spend days with a book only to get to the end and find out it was a waste of time. Thanks Scott Smith for helping convince me that there aren't very many good story-tellers out there worth my time anymore.I'll stick with Non-Fiction. At least we know it was interesting enough for someone to put into print. Because ""The Ruins"" certainly wasn't."
2,Waste of Time,"Don't let the premise fool you. I thought this sounded like an awesome story - people getting lost in the jungle, trying to survive off the land. First off, I am okay with the ""supernatural,"" but this is simply absurd. This is 15+ hours listening to (or reading) a story about people who have no chance. As bored as I was, I couldn't help but anxiously anticipate finding out how the story would end. I was disappointed.Let me put it to you this way. The story got dumber dumber as it went on. Just when I thought I had heard the stupidest thing, the author thought of something else to trump it. Really, this is really that bad. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because nothing is as bad as a John Saul novel (see my other reviews). This story is very farfetched, dragged out, not far from boring and more than anything, very, very depressing."
5,AMAZING,"this is one of the best books ever and now it going to be a movie!! i simply cant wait for this movie!!! the book is amazing and is intense,it has character development alot of tension and its something new! i really hate horror books but this one is a must buy!!!"
1,no bueno.,"a good way to describe this book: if a movie was made into a book, this is how it would go. especiialy the ending. oh god the ending.too simple, too predictable, too long?i feel like this book could have been cut in half, easily.dont read this book. or see for yourself."
2,Done Much Better Before,"If you're looking for an exciting romp through some Central American ruins, don't buy this book. There aren't any ruins. Anywhere. In fact, this whole book is basically a ripoff of Clark Ashton Smith's ""The Seed From the Sepulcher"", published in Weird Tales in October 1933. He told the same story in one tenth the number of pages and did it better. I first discovered that story in 1960, and I still get chills when I read it, 45 years later. I'm just really glad I bought ""The Ruins"" at Costco instead of paying full street value for it."
3,The Ruins,"""The best horror novel of the new century,"" says Stephen King. Imagine the scene over dinner at the King household the nite that blurb hit print: Joe Hill screaming across the table, ""I hate you, Dad, I hate you,"" then running upstairs in tears. ""Nice goin, Steve,"" Tabitha says. At about 300 pages, Scott Smith's long-awaited followup to ""A Simple Plan"" might have been the horror classic King's blurb suggests. Stretching it out to 500-plus pages gives the reader time to think, to question the logic of the story's rules, to spot the holes in the plot and to lose sympathy for Smith's protagonists, who are not exactly the stuff of future neurosurgeons. They're dumb, spoiled, damn weener kids who probly deserve to get trapped on a hill with man-eating plants. Although it's far from the classic Smith's first novel is, ""The Ruins"" is pretty slick B-movie entertainment. Even as flabbily padded as it is, it never bores."
2,Not as great as I'd hoped,"I didn't really care for this book, mainly because the characters were all so annoying, I didn't care what happened to them. The most interesting character in the book was not a human being at all, but I won't elaborate because I don't want to give anything more away."
2,Ruined trees,"Don't waste your time or money. The characters have no depth. The story is over the top with no begining or end. The author, instead of writing a good story, thinks of obscure bodily injuries the characters succumb to in hopes to make your stomach churn."
4,a page turner,The premise is ridiculous actually. But I couldn't put this one down! I really enjoyed it.
1,Inane piece of garage,"I read from 30 to 40 books a year including novels, historical works, and classics. This book clearly rates among the worst three books that I have ever read! One star is too generous.The author's style is plodding, rambling, and downright irritating. You could skim to every third page and not miss a beat. The plot is equally depressing and pointless. I can't decide if he is a Stephen King wannabee or a phycologist wannabee. In this effort he fails at both.Walter Mehl."
1,Won't take Stephen King's advice as quickly next time,"I really enjoyed Smith'sA Simple Planand saw Stephen King's glowing review in Entertainment Weekly, so I was looking forward to this book. I didn't find it to be very compelling and wouldn't recommend it. Alternately, I'm 100 pages into my next purchase,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage), and it's VERY promising."
1,"Should be titled ""Zero!""","No, nothing, nada exploration of the ""evil force,"" or ""protagonist,"" which is central to the storyline of this book. In short, people are minipulated and eaten by a plant????? Would have given it a zero but was compelled by the rating system to give it one star."
1,Stinker,"Occasionally it's fun to read a bad book. However, when a book is this bad, it's no fun at all. This is truly one of the worst novels I've read in many, many years. Scott Smith takes an idea about carnivorous, omniscient vines growing in the Mayan jungle and tries to scare us. Instead he bores us to tears and insults our intelligence. The true horror is that this story was published in the first place. I'll gamble the farm: we'll be seeing trailers for the Hollywood adaptation within the year."
2,"Slow and lame, and totally not scary","I foolishly bought this book based on Stephen King's dustjacket tout that it was the best book he'd read all year, and was sadly disappointed to learn that Mr. King apparently had yet to read any books at all this year prior to this one. While the writing is okay, the story is WAAAAAAAAAAAY too long for what it is, and frankly lame and silly. Flesh eating plants that won't let you go and make fun of you --- oooh!! ahhh! Totally stupid plot, with average or dopey characters. Why on earth nobody bothered to burn out these stupid plants with napalm before, or simply seed the entire hill and mine with salt (since apparently that stops it from growing) is an unsolved mystery in this goofey novel. At best, a book to read while stranded in the airport, then toss."
2,"If you liked ""A Simple Plan"", you won't like this one...","I was a big fan of Scott Smith's first book, ""A Simple Plan,"" and recommend it to anyone who asks. But I was seriously disappointed by ""The Ruins"". It is the equivalent of a ""B"" movie horror flick. Shallow characters find themselves trapped by the equivalent of a ""monster"" (I won't ruin it for those who still decide to read it for themselves), and then proceed to make all the wrong, dumb decisions you see in bad movies. The ending will be just what you expect it to be. Eventually this will be made into a movie , so just wait for the movie, since the book reads just like a movie...same pacing, same ""cut to the next scene"" type writing, etc."
3,A page-turner that I would recommend skipping,"The Ruins, like the Simple Plan, is a real page-turner. It is a gripping story that unfortunately is unsatisfying. As a horror story, the main problem is that the culprit is a plant and some backward mayans who somehow can run a highly disciplined militia when necessary. I thought the writing was excellent and had many positive traits but that does not make up for a plot that becomes stagnant and just feeds off itself until there is nothing left to write about. The story does create suspense and interest that I think only lead to let downs as the outcomes become clear and I think unimaginative.This book does offer some interesting illustrations of what may happen to people as they face isolation and certain death with an ever increasing sense of hopelessness. The descending spiral is similar to what we see in A Simple Plan."
3,Interesting Idea,"This is a good horror book. Not the greatest but not the worst. It makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation,"
2,oh please!!!!!!!!!!!!,"how can the vines who trap, can mimic, can think , take so long to kill each one..so boringly and annoyingly...?????????????????how could stephen king give that review???????????????/"
4,Astounding,"I started this book having heard nothing about, with no preconceptions, and only the vaguest idea of its plot. I read it over the course of a week when I didn't have much to do, and was riveted from start to finish. The tension builds slowly, almost unnoticeable at first, until it grows into a cacophony. I felt so much for the characters, which makes Smith's ""take no prisoners"" approach to writing more effective, because any character can die at any time. Highly Recommended."
5,A spellbinding descent into horror!,"It's been two days since I finished this book and I can't stop thinking about it. I think it is one of the best horror novels I have ever read.It makes no sense for people to give this book a bad review because it isn't about Mayan culture or the exploration of ancient ruins. The ""ruins"" the title refers to are what the characters themselves ultimately end up becoming. These people (who can be annoying, but who can't?) are put in a horrible, impossible situation and end up becoming the victim of a relentless, unbelievably cruel and malevolent being. This story really is an essay on what people will do when facing their ultimate doom, and how far they will go to survive.If you are not a fan of gore, psychological torture, self mutilation or improptu medical prodedures described in graphic detail, then stay away. Otherwise, go outside, take a seat by your garden, crack this open and enjoy."
1,Yawn,"Loved his first book ( A Simple Plan). This one I honestly didn't/couldn't finish. Wayyy....tooooooo.......drawnnnn.....out. Got half way through and found myself only scanning paras and flipping pages. Don't even care if the end of this book was actually fascinating ( I have no idea), just couldn't stay with it."
1,AVOID THIS BOOK!,"I am not the type that easily/frequently predicts endings . . . but this book is transparently predictable. The 5oo pages could be covered simply enough in 100 pages. Formulaic, dull, uninspired. Like so many other recent reviewers, I ask: why is this book popular?"
1,No redeeming social value,"This is an uninspired horror-flick wannabe - ""Day of the Triffids"" meets ""The Hills Have Eyes."" It is depressing, gross and stupid. Reading this book may actually be harmful to the psyche. It is horrifyingly bad.The characters are all banal. The horror is gross, not scary. There is absolutely no suspense. The plot lacks intelligence or even sense. It is possibly the worst book I've ever read."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read,"Wow. Ridiculous, stupid, downright asinine and, worse, horribly written. I'm angry at myself for having wasted hours of valuable reading time on this dreck, but I thought (hoped) that surely something (interesting? suprising? exciting?) would happen before the book ended. It didn't; just sort of fizzled out. I actually felt myself getting dumber while I read.Please. Save yourself the money (and time) and read something - anything - else."
1,First book I've ever thrown away,"Poorly written, the story seems to have been created by a monkey with short term memory loss. The plot progresses slowly with insignificant points drilled into the reader's head over and over again.I picked it up in the airport and was looking forward to diving into it, mostly because of the hype on the cover. Later that day I actually threw it away in disgust."
2,One of the most unsatisfying books ever...,"I recently read A Simple Plan and thought it was absolutely phenomenal and for that reason, was anxiously awaiting Scott Smith's new book.While the Ruins was suspenseful and the character's dynamics were interesting, the ending was a complete let down. Smith's lack of explanation for the vines characteristics was truly annoying. I threw the book down after having read it, disgusted by the lack of plot. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Not very scary,"From the blurbs on the jacket cover and other reviews, I thought this was going to be a really frightening story. It begins with the requisite young couples heading out on a journey that you know will go bad. They end up in a remote Mayan jungle with some mysterious things going on that cannot be explained. From there the story turns into more of a character study of the six young people than a horror story. The mystery is eventually revealed but never really explained. The reader keeps waiting for something exciting to happen but it never does. Mr. Smith is a very good writer but the pre-release hype for this book is somewhat misleading. Wait for the paperback."
3,A mixed bag...,"Oddly, this story was more ""interesting"" than horrific. It ambled along and kept my interest, but I never cared that much about the fate of the characters, which in itself is odd because they were developed fairly well.What kind of sinks the story ultimately is how little the characters did to try to save themselves. And...after finishing and rethinking it - or reading some reviews out here - the implausabilities in the story are glaring.But, it's a quick read and as I said, ""interesting""."
4,I'll never look at plants the same way again,"One of the creepiest books I've read recently. I kept thinking about it after I read it, which is the mark of a good book to me."
2,Frustrating almost-there thriller,"Smith has written a page-turner, but it's like cotton candy--tastes good going down but of no substantive value; in fact after you finish you won't feel good.Perhaps Smith meant this as an allegory about the passive yuppie-wannabes, but the characters' lack of common sense and, even more so, lack of intelligent curiosity kinda had me rooting for the, um, big bad. They have clues and they don't even look at them; they don't even try to find a way to defeat the evil.I'm sorry I spent the money on a hardcover."
2,The Mine Shaft,"Did anyone else wonder, other than my husband and me, why no one explored that mine shaft. There was fresh air blowing through there and a possible way out. Was this the untimate red herring?"
4,Solid Horror,"I'm not generally a voracious reader of the horror genre, but my wife and I both read The Ruins shortly after its publication, and we both enjoyed it. It has some terrific images -- I can already imagine a very successful transition to the film screen. It's not as suspenseful as it might have been, perhaps because of the insular nature of the setting, but it did offer its share of surprises and startling moments. And some genuine, cringe-worthy horror. I'd recommend it -- especially to fans of the genre. My wife and I were divided only over the ending (NEVER FEAR, NO SPOILERS!) -- I liked it more than she did. Which possibly tells you a little something about me! :)"
1,Mediocre at best,"I picked up this book to read on vacation and had to make myself finish it. Normally I read a book and put it on my shelves to keep and hopefully read again later. I might even recommend it to someone else or lend it out. Not this one. It went in the garbage.The premise sounded good and I kept hoping that it would get better. But it didn't. It was one of the few stories where I was actually happy for the characters to meet the ends that they did.Apparently it will be a movie later this year and now that I think about it, it was so shallowly written that perhaps Smith was writing it for the big screen instead of people who wanted to read a good novel."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"A good friend gave me this book a while back and never warned me of how awful it is. Recently I went to the movies and saw previews (which looked awesome) and decided to pick it up. The first 50 pages, agony. The next 100, interesting but not good. I am just past page 200 to date, waiting for something to happen and thinking of not finishing the book. ( I decided to finish the book. The best part of it occurs between page 290 and 319, the end. It didn't make the novel worth reading, however it was fast paced and written like a thriller. My opinion is unchanged.) It is outright boring. The author would have done better to condense this novel to a 30 page short story. Don't waste your time or money on it. This may be one of the few times the movie will be better than the book."
5,Bizarre Terror,"I read this book in one sitting - the terror is so real that I felt like it could, and did, happen. No more trips to Mexico or anywhere there are forests. I had to keep getting something to drink and munch on because the terror of the characters made me feel hungry and thirsty. Stephen King is a flop compared to Smith. If you want to be shocked out of your daily life read this with a glass of water and a sandwich. It is wonderful and I will keep Smith on my list of ""check for new books""!"
1,Better at 100 pages,"Scott Smith took a good story and managed to drag it out for over 500 boring pages. If you like slow moving books filled with insignificant details you'll love this one. Stupid! For instance, one of the girls peed on herself and used what little water they had to wash off her foot. Sure, that could happen. And they've got a killer plant that they make no effort to stay away from. That also makes sense. If you want to save yourself the boring details that carry no suspense then read the first hundred pages and then skip to the end of the book. I would give this book 0 stars if it was an option."
2,Depresssssinggg!,"Well written, but depressing. Nothing, I repeat, nothing good ever happens. After awhile, I just wanted it to end, and thankfully, it did (with a whimper)."
2,Is it just me?,"I really wanted to like this book, but I kept asking myself: ""why don't they just burn the damn vine and get the hell out of there?"""
1,Why did I waste my time?,I started the book optimistic thanks to Stephen King but sadly I was disappointed! The characters made vital mistakes all along the way and there was never any doubt that they were trapped but I was waiting for more than just a ridiculous vine to be the enemy. I finished the book and I am still hoping for more. I lost interest immediatly but I am the type of person that has to finish a book once I start it.
1,Pathetic,"I love Stephen King.....having said that how does he give a positive review to this piece of s**t. This really was the worst ""horror"" novel I ever read. PLEASE save your money!!!!"
1,ruine,"""The Ruins"" is cheap and sadistic storytelling with a downward trajectory of a narrative that just dips lower and lower. As a reader, even if you're not rooting for an outright happy ending, on some level you hope to see some kind of curveball thrown at you, and to witness a glimmer of hope that the situation is not as hopeless as it seems. The Ruins is the horror equivalent of the worst type of contemporary fiction, meant to do nothing much more than bum you out -- if Smith was put in charge of writing ""Star Wars"", Luke, Leia and Han would have been crushed in the garbage compactor on the Death Star."
1,"what a pointless, unenjoyable, waste of time","I took a chance based on Stephen King's review (professional courtesy? lost poker bet?) It started out with potential in the first chapter or two and it soon takes a nosedive. You learn all you'll ever learn about the characters and the ""horror"" they face (which is not scary) within the first couple chapters. The characters stagnate and are so stupid (taking tequila and no water for a trek in the rainforest) and annyoing (obsessing over whether the hotel maid has stolen my watch while facing a killer vine) I was rooting for the vine. The scenarios I started to come up with out of boredom (they kill the vine with the tequila) were more entertaining than waiting for something to happen only to find out that nothing does."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I bought this book because I like thrillers, but this was one of the most excruciatingly bad books I have ever read. The plot was as slow as molasses, the characters one dimensional, and the sentence construction choppy. I hated everything about this book, but most of all, the two women characters who apparently were nothing more than airheads in crisis. I kept thinking the book would get better, but never did. Finally toward the end of the book, I scanned it very quickly just to get through it to see how it was going to end. I don't think I ever felt this way about a book before."
2,You've got to be kidding.,"Granted, I didnt read all of the reviews, but am I the only one who realized that this book is merely a reworking (and a poor one, at that) of The Beach? Its the SAME STORY--only with half the substance and the addition of a ridiculous plot element. Killer vines that can mimic sounds and smells?? Riiiight. I continued to read only because I wanted to see how Smith was going to explain the vines---what they were, how they'd come into existence, what motivated them to turn ""evil"" and how the Mayans played into it all. And not ONE of those questions was answered. If you're considering reading The Ruins because you find the premise to be compelling, check out The Beach. It was amazing--I could not put it down and continued to think about it days after I'd finished. Not the case with this one."
3,Wait for the Movie,"Smith does his job: I kept turning pages to find out what would happen. On the plus side, the dialogue is pretty good, the characterizations aren't half bad, and the book is somewhat creepy.That said, the prose is flat and passive, the first 35 pages are needlessly dull, and the plot is flimsy. I hope the movie version aimed at teenagers will be much better."
1,Bloody Awful,"This is the worst bit of trash I have ever read. Do not waste your time or money. I really liked ""A Simple Plan"" and looked forward to reading this book. I was deeply disappointed as the plot is completely asinine. Not only is the title misleading, but the reader is shocked as the true scope of the story slowly comes into view-- how is it possible that someone could have thought that this was a good idea? Were the author and/or editor and/or publisher on drugs, or simply blind to the sheer stupidity of the idea? The few large words in it are repeated over and over. ""Implacable"" and ""inexplicable"" are used repeatedly-which would be my words to describe this nonsensical novel. The characterizations are trivial and predictable. One gets the feeling the author was writing this not to tell a story but to pitch a TV movie. Absolutely wretched."
1,A complete waste of time,"This has very little value. It was obviously written to serve as a screenplay for a B-grade horror movie. It lingers on gore. But the plot is ridiculous - a man-eating vine that thinks, and plots to kill all the characters - Yup a ""Little Ruins of Horrors"" -HAHAHA. Boy am I glad that the vine killed all the characters. Too bad it couldn't get rid of the author before he got this turkey published."
2,"The Only 'Ruins"" Was The Book Itself","Six college kids on break in Cancun meet and go west into the jungles of the central Yucatan. That's the entire plot and it all happens within the first 20 pages. The remaining 335 pages is constant repetition by the author in an attempt to fill out the space between the front and back covers. You need 2 hands to count the number of times the writer tells how these kids do the same walk up and down a hill in Mexico. They enter a tent, they exit a tent, they enter, exit, enter,......well, you get the picture. Even the characters thoughts are retold so often you want to scream ""enough is enough already"". Toss in a seemingly alive plant and still you couldn't save this fiasco. The ending, although abrupt and final, is irrelevant. The entire read was a big joke.I'll stick with Stephen King and Dean Koontz thank you."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I really enjoyed A Simple Plan so I was looking forward to reading Scott Smith's new book. The negative reviews say it all unfortunately -- not particulary scary, the characters are not particularly well-developed or interesting and there's certainly not much at all about the Mayans. I keep reading, hoping against hope, that there would be some twist to make the book more interesting and that the book would not end in the obvious way that became more and more inevitable as the story plodded on."
1,Don't waste your time,This book was absolutely absurd. I just have a few things to say so that I don't waste anymore of my life on this ridiculous novel. First: Not ONE of the characters was ever developed enough for you to CARE whether or not they lived or died. .. I guess that's not true . . I was happy when the last character met their demise by the ventriloquist/flesh eating flower...It meant that the torture was over . . not theirs . . . MINE! Stephen King . . what were you thinking? It was a waste of precious time that I will never get back. DON'T BOTHER!
3,Did not grow on me,"This book was like a bad ""B"" movie. I like fantasy and science fiction but this was just a silly gruesome tale that really went nowhere. I agree with the other reviewer who said that they were waiting for the villain to appear. The book jacket is misleading. There were no ""ruins"" and no ""other"".It could have been a great creepy story. Too bad."
2,Young And The Restless Meets Little Shop Of Horrors,"For such a slow and calculated buildup, I expected a metric-ton more payoff than Mr. Smith gave me. Whiny, shallow characters complain for hundreds of pages in this completely laughable scenerio. The actual writing itself is not bad, but all manner of common sense for these characters gets thrown out the window. Frustrating, overly long, and ultimately, a waste of time. The predictable ending didn't help, either. This would have been an interesting short story, but certainly not a full length novel."
2,Ruined!,"Scott Smith does a decent job of setting-up the premise and creating some palpable suspense. However, the novel is ruined by having not one likable character. These punk kids are all trapped on this mysterious Mexican hill in the middle of nowhere and home to some man-eating vines, and quite frankly, you don't really care what happens to them. The book goes nowhere, full of red-herrings, and some mildly interesting details (like the second-mind shaft or the story of the archaeologists) that never lead to anything. The storyline becomes very repetative and is only good for a few laughs during the well-written gross-out sections. Otherwise, Smith's novel is a huge disaster."
2,Not a great read!!!,"Scott Smith's ""Simple Plan"" was a really knockout hard to put down book, but ""The Ruins"" really falls short of his talents. It started out very good and interesting but as I kept reading it I expected to really get into it. It did not happen!!! Plain and simple it was boring and really an unrealistic story.Definetly not worth wasting your time on."
1,Warning: Danger Ahead!,"Don't let yourself get sucked into this book; it will ensnare you and you'll regret it. This book is pure horror, without any redeeming value or payoff. I picked up this book thinking that it was a mystery or thriller, but it does not have the basic, essential elements of either of those genres. The writing is exceedingly clever and will keep the pages flying, but the emptiness at its core left me feeling depleted and depressed. Maybe fans of fantasy/horror/science fiction will like this book, but for me, it was a waste of a perfectly good afternoon!"
1,beyond bad - dont buy!,"The ruins is about tourists, visiting cancun, that are looking for the brother of one of them on the island. The brother is supposingly with archeologists digging out ruins. In the end - which there is not much more to this book - they get all eaten by a killer vine. Very funny also Mayans are included that basically watch them die and do nothing else in that book! I would say this is a book for 12 year olds that wanna read something ""real scary"". Ruins are nowhere. What a joke - I cannot believe somebody would bother writing a story like that and someone is actually publishing it. And I wouldnt bother reading but my bookclub... : )"
2,I know Stephen King and you're no Stephen King,"I will never get back the night I spent reading this novel. The most ridiculous storyline--unbelievable, ludicrous, pick any other synonym for silly-beyond-words. How anyone could believe this storyline and be frightened is something I can't comprehend. At some points, it is truly laughable; maybe that's why Ben Stiller has optioned the novel. I usually agree with Publishers' Weekly,but don't waste your time with this silly stuff."
2,"Complex and well written, yet about nothing","Sheesh, was this a disappointment. I hate to bag on a talented writer...but this one would never have made it, had it not been written by a guy with a track record. If you've read the other reviews, folks have already talked about one of the main weaknesses of the book, but let me put it in this spoiler free way: Mr. Smith ran out of gas. He spent roughly 450 pages setting up the story, setting, and most especially the ""baddie"", and then wraps it up in a swift 20 pages or so. I only finished it to see how he would pull it off, and it was a cheap, lame ending like you see in terrible, direct to DVD horror movies."
4,See your memories,I loved this! I received a similar one for a gift and put in some pictures that my daughter took. When she saw it with the pics in there she loved it so I bought her a set and inserted a set of pictures too. It looks great and we can keep our memories at our fingertips!
4,"Good Mystery, Lots of Great History",A nice mystery with some well-placed feminist tendencies. And I learned a lot about turn of the century english coal mining - which is actually pretty interesting!Recommended for mystery buffs or folks looking for a smart read.
1,End of the road book,"Kind of expensive for a mouldering old, wrinkled paperback. Next time will look for better seller and in hard cover.Possibly I should wear rubber gloves when reading if I dare."
5,One of my all-time favourites!,"I love Martin Cruz Smith's books as a whole but Rose was a book I truly could not put down and have re-read many times since. I found the characters to be a brilliant mix of good and evil, This was one of the few books where I was continually wishing I would come to the end to resolve the ongoing mystery surrounding the missing curate whilst at the same time not wishing the book to ever end because I loved it so much. BRILLIANT!!!!!"
4,Great!,"I can't tell if this is fiction or not. I kept checking the cover for ""Santa Evita : A Novel"" but the ""A Novel"" part was never there. The title page has it listed under the Library of Congress as 'fiction' ... but I'd have to do much more (extensive!) research to make a determination.Before I read this what I'd known of Evita was the disney-fied version of Andrew Llyod Weber/Tim Rice in their musical 'Evita' - this opened up whole new doors over who Eva Duarte Peron was, and what she meant to the country of Argentina. Even if this is a piece of historical fiction ... it's worth the read because I do think that it helps one to understand the mindset of the Argentinians at the time both before and after Eva Peron's death.Excellent read."
1,Collection,"National Geographic - Mega Structures CollectionIn my opinion the product is not well explained. Reading Mega structures Collection I thougt the shipment was the whole collection. If it would had been correctly explained I could choose other volume not vol 1 and vol 2, finally shiped."
5,Highly entertaining!,"Two disc set that covers some very interesting topics; from the military might of the C-5A cargo behemoth to the world`s largest port and what it takes to navigate and handle the superships who enter, this is a fab look into the Mega-world. NatGeo did it up from all angles, and is worth repeated viewings."
5,A fine read with much to ponder and is not to be missed,"Buddhism has a simple coherent philosophy, and many seek to place its value in their lives. ""The Buddha in Your Mirror: Practical Buddhism and the Search for Self"" is a guide for even non-Buddhists to more coherently apply the principles of Buddhism to their life with their own simple tips to live a more enlightened life. Drawing on the works of the famed Buddhist thinker Nichiren and his direct path to Enlightenment, the authors put forth an excellent guide to better understanding the religion and philosophy. ""The Buddha in Your Mirror"" is a fine read with much to ponder and is not to be missed."
4,Very helpful,I loved this book. It is very concise and easy to follow. The information is priceless.I would recommend to anyone searching .
5,Buddhism you can understand,"I just finished this Book and i loved it! yes It's Modern Buddhism but I'm a Modern Man and i live in the Modern world and i can understand this, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Modern Buddhism."
5,Don't miss this mystery!,"I was excited to read this book because it combined to of my favorite genres - murder mysteries and musical theatre! The characters are interesting and kept me guessing the entire time. I won't give away any of the twists and turns in this book, but I will say this: YOU WON'T GUESS THE END! This is hands down one of the most fun mysteries I have ever read. I could not put it down."
5,goanna be sweet,this yu yu hakusho will contain the episodes- yuseke vs.rando:99 attacks-where yuseke defeats rando.the beasts of maze castle-the episode where kurama and hiei join yuseke in the fight against the saint beasts.genbu the stone beast-the spirit detective gang fights the first saint beast genbu.byakko's lair-kuwabara insists on facing the second saint beast byakko alone.in miscellanious notes there are four saint beasts and the byakko fight dosen't end the last episode of this video.
5,I like Facets,"Thanks to Facets video for making so many great Eastern European movies available. Though not souped up like Criterion, who cares. These films wouldn't be seen in the U.S. without Facets and nearly all of them are well respected, though not well known. Jessie is as offbeat as it gets, done by people who for a short time could get away with just about anything (no over controling government or studio). The results are inspired. And if you see just one Olga Schoberova movie in your life, it probably should be this one."
5,An Enlightening Experience,I have read many books on self-help and I find this book to be one of the best. Reading and allowing the message to filter through is an enlightening and eye-opening experience. Thank you Aretta and Ian for giving us the message to love and to be patient with the most difficult and simplest of challenges in everyday life.
1,WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?,"I probably read 100 or more books each year, including a significant number of business and sales books. I enjoyed some of Robert Kiyosaki's other advisor books, but this one really [is bad].It is full of vague analogies to whatever kind of ""dog"" you are -the point that you do not have to be aggressive to be in sales is also foolish and false. You can certainly bring your own personality to sales or any other profession, and you SHOULD, but all this psychobabble about ""being your own dog"" or whatever is just that - silly psychobabbly designed to seperate you from your money and put it in an author's pocket who really has nothing useful to say.If you really want to learn something about selling that you can actually USE, read Zig Ziglar's ""Sales 101"" or Donald Moine's ""Ultimate Selling Power""."
2,very small,the shirt was very nice but it was alot smaller than a normal medium shirt. if i were to get another i would have got a large
3,Great fit... But had to be returned because of damages.,"I gave this a 3 star rating because the shirt itself fit great, but I soon realized that there was a quarter sized hole in the shoulder. The material is soft and comfortable feeling, and overall I loved the look.Had it not been for this hole, I'd give this 5 stars, but the inconvenience of having to return it for a replacement docked my rating by a couple stars.If you are willing to chance getting a damaged one, then I'd recommend it... after all, I liked the fit so much that I figured it was worth it."
2,Thin material and no hem.,"While this t-shirt looks good in the picture, it's actually pretty poor quality once you get it in hand. The material is very thin and the bottom of the shirt is not hemmed, which means it has a tendancy to roll up. The price is right, however, but you definitely get what you pay for."
4,The Seduction Project by Miranda Lee (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Goodbye, Miss Nice-person-next-door! When Molly McCrae transformed herself into a striking redhead, the entire male population of Sydney stood up and took notice! But her make-over was for Liam Delaney only. Sure, he showed an interest in the new-look Molly, but not in the way she wanted. He was over-protective - even a little jealous - but it seemed that a relationship with her couldn't be further from his mind. It was time for an ultimatum. If Liam didn't want Molly to lose her virginity to another admirer, then he would have to make love to her himself!"
1,not what I saw.,What I received is different than what is pictured. The model I received is a little smaller so it didn't fit what I wanted it for. No bueno!
2,Is this a spanish soap or pubic access?,"It looks like what I might see skipping past the high school av channel except all the cheerleaders are in their 30's. The movie was clearly slapped together to cash in on the slumber party massacre movies or whatever, but these guys didn't even bother with film or actors a script, it looks like someone had $500 bucks in their pocket and some milfs willing to work cheap and grabbed a crappy camcorder and said act or something, I'm 30mins in and can go no further, good name nice box, not good, and not not good in a good way. <2stars instead of 1 because I can't bring myself to watch the rest, maybe something redeemable happens latter, but I doubt it>"
3,Better Than Expected. Funny Commentary,"This film is really not bad. There is an actual plot and some mystery (not just endless killings for no good reason like most slasher movies a la Friday the 13th), plenty of gratuitous nudity by mostly women with natural breasts! The acting is pretty good. The Commentary with Jim Wynorski and Gigi Erneta is pretty funny when you find out how many of the people associated with the film are using fake names and insist upon not being named, and how they made the film with no money. A film being made cheaply is not a crime. The film looks pretty good with what money they had to make the film. If you listen to the Commentary, you will have a better appreciation of the film."
2,Don't go in the house!,Is it scary? No. Is it sexy? No. The humor is weak and if you're looking for nudity there are three brief scenes hardly worth mentioning.
5,Excellent watch,"I have always loved seiko watches, this is a very elegant watch. I got it before the ETA expected. No complains at all."
2,Kinda Ridiculous,"This CD is the same exact album as ""Time After Time: The Best Of Cyndi Lauper"" but the track numbers are rearranged and this CD is cheaper."
4,Good product,"I bought this from Amazon after going to multiple pet stores to find a quality, versatile carrier for our son's yorkshire terrier. This actually is very flexible in that it is a backpack, a rollaway, and more importantly for us, a safe car seat for our pet who normally would be all over the interior. It's also the correct size for carry-on with the airlines. The inside is roomy enough for our pet to lie down and has a safety strap to keep him secure. Two nice side pockets add convenience. The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had some extra padding inside for comfort, or at least have an insert which could easily fit. I haven't found anything yet, but this was definitely the best option for us for car traveling and air travel."
4,"Essential, but does not cover all the ground","Living in Europe, I had the extreme pleasure and opportunity to see a lot of Euroflics in cinemas - one experience that drew me to J. Franco was seeing ""Freiras Perversas"" in a century-old ex-opera house on vacation in Portugal ... in the cellar with some raincoat locals who clearly thought I was mad showing up there. Anyway. This book contains a lot of essential information on some filmmakers, most notably Franco and Rollin, whose work really is explored further than in all other books there are. But... the book tends to concentrate on directors rather than countries which makes sense as a lot of directors worked euro-wide. But then, you can't have everything. I found this book much more attractive than Mondo Macabro."
4,This book is great for EuroTrash fans >:)~,"I got this about a year ago and I still read it! It goes into some detail about the Horror scene from day one in Europe so to speak which I thought was very cool.. It also talks about the differance in Directors in Europe, which I thought ok but why talk about so of there most terrible movies instead of the great ones?"
5,VERY GOOD ITEM!!,"I use this remote coil allways whitout problems!! IS A VERY GOOD REMOTE COIL!!!... if other person think diferent i dont know why, because is a very very good remote and very low price!! I Recommend!"
2,cheap but VERY SHORT LASTING,"cheap but VERY SHORT LASTING, these things will last less than 2 months, usually 1 month tops"
5,An outstanding disc.,"Malikova's right hand floats the melodies over her rock-solid left, generating excitement with no trace of glibness. I also very much like the darkness that she and Sanderling bring to the first movement of the Fourth Concerto, a tough work to hold together, but that here seems to grow with organic inevitability as well as an unusual amount of emotional depth. The second movement has particular cogency, with Malikova clearly making an effort to characterize each episode, building the work to an unusually satisfying conclusion.She also makes a persuasive case for the neglected First Concerto (actually the largest of these three), aided in no small degree by a conductor clearly aware of the music's debt to Beethoven and Mozart. The sonics are warm and well balanced and the piano tone is gleaming."
5,This is good music..,This music brings back memories of younger times.. Mixing the storm sounds with the music is great.. I listen to it when ever I can..
3,Stagestruck,Stagestruck is a fun little story. It get's the children thinking about ways we should and shouldn't act during school. For example when Tommy is daydreaming and not paying attention during class. As usual the illustrations are in DePaulo style cherub looking children. In fact while I was reading the story to the class one child asked why he was wearing roller skates refereeing the the cover of the book. The class also needed to know what stagestruck meant when I was done reading the story.
1,Worst movie ever,"As others have stated here, this waste of celuloid was rushed out to cash in on the science fantasy/Star Wars craze. It had horrible acting. Horrible special effects that make the old Buster Crabbe serials look like high def masterpieces. A horrible plotline. It was so bad it doesn't even work on a Troma level (and I've seen many of their films). Starcrash (the Adventures of Stella Star) doesn't even qualify as a B-film (more like a Z film?) it was so bad. Save your money!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited about this mobile because it can convert to dresser top for later use. But when I finally opened it and put it together I soon realized the attachment does not allow you to use it on our cribs. The attachment is much too small. I immediately called the number given for Fisher-Price and the woman had no sympathy. She just said sorry. She also told me all their mobiles are the same and will not fit on anything but a standard crib with small rails. We have the Emily sleigh crib and it won't fit on any side of the crib. I do not recommend this mobile unless you have an old fashioned small railed crib. To save time, I also recommend trying the attachment before you put the whole thing together."
3,ok,"my baby loves it but.. the motor got loud after 2 months of use and the batteries do not last long. it would be nice if there was time choice of 20 15 and 10 for exmpl, it has only 10min. 10 min is not long enough for my baby to fall asleep. she snoozes with the music on but as soon it turns itself off she wakes up. not enough time for her to go to deeper sleep."
1,Constant Beeps,"It beeps ALL THE TIME! The radio, the fax machine, a screaming kid. I wanted to take a hammer to it after an hour. Don't buy it. Waste of money. I threw it out after one day."
1,Annoying!,"My wife and I were looking for a way to stop mislaying our keys and thought this key finder might be useful. It responds great to whistles and claps, and any other loud noise in the room. Anytime we'd laugh, it would beep. Anytime there was a loud noise on TV or during a movie, it would beep. We even buried it under blankets and pillows and it would still pick up noises and beep at random times.We eventually broke it...which was satisfying."
5,Very warm and comforting.,"A book about finding answers to the meaning and purpose of life. Very enlightening. For those of us who seek authenticity and truth, along with hope and comfort."
2,Slightly boring,"This ""book"" seems like it was thrown together to make someone some money by leveraging Dr. Lilly's name. It was not written by Dr. Lilly or E. J. Gold. It is a transcription of some lectures they gave and there are these very annoying, piss-poor scribbles, which I suppose someone considers to be illistrations, scattered throughout the ""book"". I found Dr. Lilly's three chapters to be interesting but the book as a whole is a waste of money. You'd be better off purchasing ""The Deep Self"" or ""The Book of Floating"" if you're interested in floating."
1,Hidious,"I never write reviews for anything, but this one was so bad, I couldn't help myself. Everybody has different tastes, but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all, you will not like Belladonna. I could not make sense of it at all, it rambled on and on, never getting to the point, never picking a path, never building on a theme. It bored me with it's vague attempts to build a song. I listened to it 2 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining how bad it was, and then I dumped it. It was not my style, and I don't see how it could be anybody's style, but that's just me. I felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed. Good Luck on your listing adventures."
3,Lasted 14 months,"This scooter cover was on my Yamaha Vino 125cc scooter parked outdoors. For the price, it worked exceptionally well when it was new. The exhaust protection area was nice. It also has provisions for a windscreen, which my scooter did not have.The elastic at the bottom was pretty big as it is up for a 200cc scooter. During high winds, the cover would billow. Once, the cover had blown off completely, and I had to go down the street to recover it. Make sure you use something to tie the cover down with using the grommet holes provided on the cover.It has been about 14 months since I bought this cover, and the UV rays have worn the material on the top of the cover. The exposed material has become thin and fragile. It has split open where the seatrest has worn through. It's time to get a new cover, but since I park my bike outdoors, I will not be purchasing this one again."
4,Perfect,No complaints! I like it so much I am afraid it might get stolen but so far so good. Thanks!
4,Smells Great!,I bought this shampoo as a filler item to make my order qualify for free shipping. My kids really liked it. It smells great and is gentle.
5,AMURO NAMIE WoW!,The first time I heard a single track from Amuro Namie VCD 'Body Exist' WoW! What can I say She is hot! Her songs and on stage performace is breathe taking to say the least... I an a dedicated fan and more.... If I had one wishe it would be to meet her in person...Michael Christoper II
4,Ruthless game,This book is definately a keeper! Suspenseful to the very end! For those who are detail oriented this is perfect. A real page turner though....
4,As good as the first one,"Fans of CSI (like me) would love it... same sort of the style as the first one, with some improvements. The only bad thing is that it has a lot of bugs, but they are quickly fixed by exiting the game and going back in again. I've had two bugs per case that made it so I cuoldn't even play the game. It just makes it sort of annoying. Other than that, the game is great. :)"
3,Great Game Could Use More Excitement,"The game was great, but I think that it could use more excitement. It gets pretty boring after a while. I finished the game in like two days. It is something that I will play over again though."
3,Patches from UBI Helpful,"Overall, I really enjoyed playing the game. It was fun to see how the pieces began to fit together. It got a bit addicting.After I installed the game, I downloaded the patches from UBI. They really helped with a lot of the problems (not all, but most). They still need to work on it a little.I would like to see more cases or have cases that have differrent clues and, therefore, end differently when you play it again (like my son's Putt-Putt games). Also, I'd like more options for putting clues together. I don't like that you have to work in a certain order to get the right questions to pop up. Sometimes I pick up on a connection but had to run through four things to get a warrant, for example. If I could've had the option for combining more of the clues and jump the three other things, that would have been nice.But, I'm definitely going to buy the next CSI (Miami) game. I can't seem to stay away!"
5,False Information,The previous posted review should be ignored. I have played many games from UBI Soft without ANY installation problems. All I have in my computers are cd writers/dvd drives and I have never had any trouble installing an Ubi soft game from any of my cd writers. I think the reviewer above needs to have his equipment checked or updated. But there is NO problem with UBI Soft games and CD writers.
3,Frustratingly slow...,"Perhaps I'm impatient?I want a scale that I can step on, read within a second, and move on. This Tanita just can't compete with an analog version. I have to tag it with my foot... wait... step on... wait... and then finally I see what I weigh.Not only that, but it has tricks to make it seem consistant.Take a reading, and step off. Grab a one pound weight and step back on. Its the same cached reading.Its not ugly; It works eventually. I give it three stars."
3,"THIS IS THE ONE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, BUT...","only half of the real gem. Go to the UK site and grab the double CD as fast as you can. All meat, no sugar. This is the real JC."
2,Not for Beginners,"I read the book and I was lost inside all those details and subtitles that the author goes through trying to stuff so many technical terms without really explaining the concepts of the main technologies for the ""Beginners"" as the book title promises. I expected more from this book when I read the title, the index and the reviews above."
4,"KSW-10, musical, balanced and great for small rooms","Of course the 55-watt RMS output (225 peak) and 10 driver of the KSW-10 is best suited for smaller rooms and mid-fi systems. I found it balanced well with my JBL Control 5 with the crossover set at about 50-60 Hz, taking over only the lowest tones. In fact, it was nearly ""invisible"" until you turned it off and missed the little bit of lower end support it offered. I'd describe it as balanced, natural and musical. However, if you're into boom-boom over EQed kickdrum look elsewhere. If your system has only mono sub out, be sure to use a Y-adapter as a single channel input yields extremely weak bass.The bottomline is the KSW-10 is great for natural bass reinforcement, excelling at music. For shoot 'em up movies it's okay but you won't ""feel"" earthquakes, etc., in the seat of your pants like a 1000 watt Sunfire True Subwoofer. The KSW-10 is a great buy for the money, often discounted to $200 or less."
2,"All Boom, little bass.","I listened to this subwoofer today in a high-end audio shop and I agree this thing is a bit slow on the response and overly boomy without much definition. It's very heavy on bass, but the overtones are excessive, which might lend themselves to bass-heavy rap music and movies, but for anyone interested in crisp full-frequency music reproduction, this is not the subwoofer to get. There is a noticeable delay in the response of this unit, and its dynamic range seems to be either all bass or nothing... there's very little in-between.This is a good example of how Klipsch has lost its reputation. They used to produce their products in Hope, Arkansas. Now, like many ""U.S. companies"" they contract this crap out to China -- and it sounds like it."
2,I don't think so . .,"This version claims to be digitally remastered, but it doesn't look like it to me. I actually prefer the Alpha Video version, the print quality isn't as dark and indistinct. Nightmare Castle is a great horror film, but so far nobody has really done it justice. How about a remastered boxed set of all Barbara's horror films? - now that really would be something!"
2,The quality of service is not what I expected.,"The video quality was a little low grade looking. It was almost as if I was watching it off a VHS. The description of this video could have been more clear and straight to the point by specifying that it was being streamed off of the website and NOT downloaded to your computer. I DO NOT like having no choice but to be on-line to watch or play anything that I paid for. If I am in an area that does not have internet, I want to be able to access it! This instant video thing is a bad Idea! That was a bit too much money to pay for something that I can't fully download. Needless to say I am disappointed!However, it's great to be able to watch the Tiny Toons videos again. Anyone that is a big fan of the series will love this one. I would just suggest buying the DVD set over streaming it. You do have to pay a little bit more money, but it is worth it in the end because you can watch it anywhere."
4,Been Waiting!,"Delighted to see one of my after-school guilty viewing pleasures finally available on DVD. As remembered, the witty musical orchestration, great voice acting, and original (tongue-in-cheek) storylines are lots of fun. I do agree with other reviews that pan the cover art. What was Warner Bros. thinking? I wasn't certain this wasn't Baby Looney Tunes on first glance. The packaging is a step up from the Animaniacs release, but at least those characters looked like themselves on the covers. Please release some more of this series soon!"
1,Save you money!,"I would not want a copy of this video, even if I were featured in the racing on this video. Even if the quality of the images were better, the events captured will bore you to tears. This disk is endless video clips of average street cars drag racing on a puplic street. There are no exceptional vehicles or races and no action. My 80 year old mother would not find riding in one of those cars exciting.What a ripoff!!!!!!!!"
4,Just Walk Across the Room: Simple Steps Pointing People to Faith,"Easy to read. Inspires you to ask God to allow you to witness to someone ""today""."
3,fun toy for a day or two!,i bought this for my 9 y/o son and he was thrilled in the beginning but this is not much of a gizmo so he got bored with it. but for the price really no reason to complain overall ok.
5,idealy described and sensually exquisite,"Turning me on is sometimes quite difficult becauseforeplay is never what i'd like it to be, but Eve Locke has the knack to not only turn me on but her talents keep me as high as i've dreamed. This is THE best erotica novel i've ever read, it's better than any man could be, I'm a lesbian so perhaps i'm a bit predijuce but some of my straight female friends agree that Eve is our kind of author. She writes with her heart and tells the story's like they actually happen, she must be one of us. Other writers should read her work and learn the truth."
5,the most delightful and lewd,"this is one of the greatest erotica books ever written, i've read over 200 and the hooker and the nun is outstanding and none of the others even come close, i'm reading it to our small but naughty book club members and the response's from my listeners is unmentionable we love it, And we hope she writes enough to fill our library.We already have three of her's and i believe i've read that there a few more, so we're waiting patiently"
2,not so great experience,"It could be only our experience but my husband got stomach problems the day he ate this tuna so he won't eat the other 11 that are in the pantry. The expiration date is in four months, which is a little soon. I will have to give it a go. Will try and let you know how it works out."
5,Western Triple Feature: The Pledge/Avenging Angel/Prairie Fever,"I had seen these three movies during one of the Preview times for Hallmark Channel on Dishnetwork. Many times before buying movies, I'll see them either at a theater or on a movie channel. If it's a ""keeper"", meaning ""I'd like to see it many times over"". . . it's not a ""Once is enough"" thing. . . then I buy it. If I don't like it I don't buy it. Kevin Sorbo and Luke Perry do a great job in these Westerns. Now I don't have to wait for Hallmark to come along to see them. Thank you for paying attention to my likes and dislikes.Billie"
3,We all laughed at this toy!!,"This toy looked so cool when I saw my dad had bought it for my 1 year old for Christmas. Then he got on it and pushed the buttons, OMG lol, it sounds like it should be pink with rainbows an unicorns! It is this girly song that just doesn't match the personna of what the toy appears to be. Also it does not turn as others have said, and is pretty short so not good for older kiddos. But my 1 year old still loves it, we declared it a good outside toy!"
2,1st century flop,"I was shocked at how bad this film was, no real information just fluff and stuff. I have numerous historical DVDs but this one will be going on the bottom shelf."
3,Audio Production Is Below Average,"An interesting recounting of Rome's history. The video quality it fine when streaming but the audio levels are interrupted during cut scenes transitioning from the narrator to the event. The event sound becomes louder and when the transition takes place back to the narrator, the audio is lowered. I understand that a dramatic scene would require higher levels of audio but they are done VERY poorly. The audio levels spike where a simple fade up or fade down would do the trick. When listening to it, the quality of audio levels is very amateur."
1,Utterly Disappointing,"While others have done a decent job in describing how terrible this documentary is and how much better PBS could have done producing it, what added to my surprise apart from the poor work of scholarship, were the comments made about Jesus. Karen King, a self proclaimed expert on the history of ancient Christianity narrated a couple of incidents and attributed them to the blessed life of Jesus. Later she goes on to say that those events rightly led to the crucifixion of Jesus by the Romans. I found that rather nonsensical.Also, a great deal of time was spent narrating obscene verses from the collections of Ovid which I wonder why were found to be more relevant to the Roman Empire as compared to the political turmoil Rome was in or the military expeditions of her generals. Quite frankly, I had never imagined a PBS documentary would have disappointed me more."
4,FUN BOOK,"This is a book my wife remembers reading as a kid. I read it for the first time to my kid who is 2 and it was a good read. Not too long, but not too short. Personally I thought the ending was a little boring and could have been a little more creative or funny, but over all I like it."
3,"Recommended, but with caveats...","While this book is very well researched and provides a wealth of backround information and detail on all of the key players in the Smiths, it ultimately fails to provide any real insight into the inner workings of the band. The lack of interviews with Morrissey and those closest to Morrissey ensure that the book presents at best an incomplete picture of the story of the Smiths.Another flaw is that Rogan never really seems to get a feel for his subject. Despite all his research, you never get the sense that he understands what the Smiths were really about and what made them truly special.Despite these problems, I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some insight into the backround of the group, the photo section alone makes this book well worth the purchase."
2,disappointing,"I wanted this book to be great, but it isn't. Packed with pointless detail, blind heresay and pop psychology, the author postures and predicts in an overbearing and irritating way. Coupled with the fact that Morrissey was not involved with the writing of this book and has subsequently called for Rogan's head, I felt disloyal reading this book and it left a sour taste in my mouth. Rogan claims to be a Smith's devotee and yet has painted Morrissey as a neurotic, control freak."
1,This shipped product does not work.,Working with RMC support to register and use the software since a month. The issue could not be resolved by technical support. The product is unusable.
4,Good movie,This was a good movie about German college students who apposed WWII. The acting was good and I've watched it more than once. The movie is in German (which I wanted) and you can obviously have subtitles if you don't speak German. The movie centers around Sophie Scholl who attempted to educate German citizens on the reality of the War and is taken in by German police for questioning. You'll have to watch the movie to find out what happens from there.
4,Outstanding Film making,"Sophie Scholl, The Final Days tells the story of a 22 German girl who dared question the Nazi state in 1943. It is a masterpiece of film making, and a beautifully executed film. The acting is top-notch, and the story excellent. If you have two hours to spare, you will not regret watching Sophie Scholl, whose bravery will stay with you forever."
3,Lovely stuff!,"I found the album strangely appealing and yet I can sense how ""vapid"" describes the rhythms...it means flat and uninteresting by the way. On the contrary I felt my spirits uplifted by the music. I think you will too."
5,great sequel to a wonderful story,"Like its predecessor, The Bark of the Bog Owl, this book is loosely based on the life of David (of The Bible), but set in the mythical land of Corenwald, which is very much like the southern coastal swamps of the United States where the author grew up. In this installment, King Darrow becomes jealous of Aidan, who triumphed over the Pyrthens and whom the prophet Bayard says will be the Wilderking. After Aiden's three years of study at Tambluff Castle, the king sends the young man on a fool's errand into the Feechiefen Swamp (from which no one has ever returned alive), to bring back the frog orchid that might cure Darrow's melancholy. Of course, Aiden finds help among his feechiefolk friends, but he also finds a new enemy waiting in the swamp's deepest recess masquerading as the Wilderking. The book ends on a somewhat sad, though not entirely hopeless, note and sets the stage for the climax of Book 3, for which we eagerly waited."
2,Not much detail..only a workbook type,Very brief overview.. does not offer any deep thoughts or guidance. I would suggest using some good internet resources instead of this book.
4,kings of the alternative scene,"SY create some of thee most beautiful landscapes with their music. this is not one of their best albums but still one of their better ones. we kick off with schizophrena which is amazing. there are other greats such as beauty lies in the eye. such a beautful song, so different and yet still rooted in rock. my personal favorites are kotton krown and white cross. amazing stuff from the greatest band in the land of nyc.the album has a great production since SY avoided the emerging digital technology. SY always were innovative and this album does not disappoint."
3,and do you like to ...?,"Firstly, CATHOLIC BLOCK (I'VE GOT A) is one of their best songs, by far. there are other great songs on here as well, COTTON CROWN, HOT WIRE MY HEART, SCHIZOPHRENIA, TUFF GNARL, and PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY all come to mind. but generally this album is not that listenable to me as a whole because of the monotonous overly-punk-styled vocals. still, it's a good album. just not where i'd introduce someone to SY."
4,Ostrch Farming,"Kate comes to the ranch that her uncle left her a share of when he died. There she meets his business partner, JD (James Dean, :) ), and is surprised to find out that the farm isn't raising chickens, but slightly larger birds. Although quite pregnant, she insists that she can do her part to help with the ostrich farm chores. JD doesn't want her there to get hurt, but they fall in love. Not a very memorable story, and more could have been said about the accident that JD's first wife died in, it's mentioned as a conflict, but never explained, it could have as likely had been a car accident as a farming accident. Not a bad story, but could have ben better."
3,Worked at first,"It worked at first, but the effects started to fade after a few weeks. I have pretty resistant acne though, so I'm surprised that this helped at all. I'm sure it would be perfect for people with mild acne, just not for me. 3/5"
1,Trash,"I dont understand the great ratings. This product is like a fake proactiv, and proactiv is garbage. The cream dried and damaged my skin. The pills dont do anything, but I already take a high end multivitamin. Overall, I just dont get how it has so many positive reviews. I started using Oxy wash and that has some very favorable results."
3,Not as expected,The tablets dont seem to do anyting... but the cream is fantastic. It dries up acne in an instant. love it
1,Undecided,"In regard to the view that Finley needs to pay more attentio to money supply and velocity i would suggest that the economies of ancient times were not as susceptible to changes in currency as our modern economy is. It seems strange that someone would give such a frugal review without further explanation. Having said that, I have only read what I could of hte book from this site but I'm sure that there are some valuable points to be taken from this authors views on the subject."
2,Mediocre at best,"I think this writer has potential, but I'm unimpressed by her work here. I appreciate the concept and cute cover design, but this book still seems mediocre to me (at best). Maybe it's just that I'm not into comic lesbian-themed novels!"
4,One of the best Korean War movies,"This is one of the best movies made about the Korean War. Unfortunately, the few movies made about this war are against the military, such as Sam Fuller's ""The Steel Helmet"". Despite a cast without the most famous names around at the time, they work well and the several battles in it are well staged and exciting."
3,Its ok,"This product is ok. Made my skin super dry and peel. It did help a little bit with my acne, but not enough to deal with the skin drying out. I did start to use a moisturizer with it and that did help. I didn't see any help from the pills. This product was not for me, waste of money!"
4,Still hoping,"It's been almost a month, and I've seen a little improvement, but it's definitely a start, I'll keep everyone updated to see if it's worth it after one more month."
1,Sucked,"Didn't think it worked for me at all. Did not take long to get to me at all. Would recommend this for people to try, just didn't work for me."
2,"didn""t work for me","Didn't work for me, but a lot of products did not for me. May be good for someone with mild acne. I would say try this product and write a review back to me if its works. I truely think this is a good product for someone else, just not me. Have heard great reviews about it on the Hairlista Inc website."
2,made skin worse,I used for a little over a month and took as directed and it did not clear up my skin actually made me break out in places I never have before and made existing acne worse. Just be warned may not work for you the way it does for others
3,Hormonal Acne,My teen has tried everything and this seems to be doing the job after two weeks of use! Her scars seem to be fading also.
1,"As an adult female, it never worked for me.","I tried these homeopathy pills in the past. I stuck to this homeopathy routine for a whole 6 months. I never saw improvement on my skin from taking these pills. I am surprised that I stuck to this homeopathic product for a good 6 months. I think I gave this product a fair chance. This just did NOT do anything for me. This goes to show not every product works the same for everyone, but I can see it works for some people.At this point, what works the best for my skin is BC pills, vitamins and herbal tea. I started taking all that after I found out the root cause of my breakouts. My doc told me my t-levels were a little high for a female. High t-levels in a woman = hormone imbalance. If you are a woman with adult acne, get your hormones checked and find out if that is the root cause."
1,Made me look horrible,"This product did not work for me at all. I had only used it for a week when I noticed bumps everywhere on my face. These pills broke me out something horrible. I believe I came across something that is helping my breakouts internally. I like the fact that this course teaches you to control my acne from the inside with food, minerals, and vitamins. Acne is not a cure but if I can find something to keep the breakouts down (which I think I have) then that is good enough for me."
4,Nice.,"I have this watch in black laquer, gold and now the stainless steel. I haven't had any trouble with the clasp opening or closing on any of my watches. I do worry that it will open and just fall away.I like Burberry a lot and these watches are fun because they're more like bracelets."
4,FLOWERS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME!,"Chanel No.5 has, of course, become an icon in the world of perfume. Whether it be song, book or film if a desirable, highly sought after scent is mentioned it is most often Chanel No. 5. However, we'd be hard pressed to choose between Chance and Chanel No.5. Let's just say it's a tie. Both are beguiling, memorable fragrances.Chance, for us, is a happy daytime fragrance as it is a rich bouquet of fresh floral sensations. There are notes of Hyacinth, White Musk, Citron, Punk Pepper, Jasmine, Fresh Vetiver, Oris Absolute and Amber of Patchouli - a magical mixture.Chance comes in a rounded bottle, almost a perfect circle presented in a pink box.It's been a favorite for some time!"
4,Good Sampler,"This 2-disc set provides a good sampler of some of the best artists in the punk genre, including several live performances. I was unfamiliar with some of the artists included on this set, and was delighted to have discovered some fine new music. Among the notable cuts is what appears to be a demo of the classic New York Dolls' song ""Personality Crisis"". For anyone who enjoys punk, this is an excellent pick."
4,A-OK,"Great price! Good cable jacket, it's comparable to my Monster cable. Solder looks good. The Connector housing are the screw together type, which I forgot that I dislike because they unscew with use. I just need to put a little glue on the threads to stop that. I ordered the 6 ft length for an effects loop. Maybe next time, I will get different colored cables for that purpose, so I will know which cable is send and which is return. Again, I just need to put some colored tape on one of them so I will know which is which without looking at the back of the equipment."
2,Lacks depth,"This book starts out with a wonderful premise, that of God's unconditional love. But it fails to develop as it repeats the same premise over and over and over. The author never goes beyond this concept...except to tell us what not to do. The book leaves me wondering how to accomplish this surrender, other than to do nothing, which is what the author advocates. I think the book may speak more to those who have been significantly wounded by people who should have been examples of love, as those are all the examples the author uses. So if you have not been significantly wounded, you may, like I, wonder why it takes him 100 pages to get the idea across that God's love is unending, unconditional, and freely given to all, and we should live that love as children of God."
5,CONFUSION IS sex,"Sonic Youth's confusion is sex did not repeat it self in their other albums. They were original on that album it's the most underated and put down Sonic youth record. They play their........ not amazing but interesting album in their catalog. I think one of the reason I like it is that I was over at a friends house and I slept over that night and he woke me up to CONFUSION IS NEXT (I highly recommend this to scare the CRAP out of people you don't like) in the line ""STICK YR. FINGERS IN YR. MOUTH SQUEEZE YR. TOUNGE AND wrench IT OUT"" man I nearly peed myself it was so funny buy this record if you like medeocore recording and great guitar riff.SONIC TOOTH"
1,My God Is This Bad,"I pretty much think my heading sums up my feelings about this record. I bought after hearing how everyone proclaimed it be brilliant. Well, its not.Some people have remarked how scary, or nightmarish, this is. Well, the only way that this either is that fact that fifteen follars has to be slapped down to purchase this unlistenable album and that is fifteen dollars you will never get back(they only give you three for it at used CD stores).If you have gotten far enough to read this, then I guess I will tell you what this record sounds like: a guitar amp turned on, left with feedback only as background music, and bad beat poetry read over it all.Sonic Youth have a few good albums in their catolog, like ""Daydream Nation"", ""Goo"", Murray Street"", but this is not one of those albums. I would say that I just don't get it, but there's nothing here to get except an asprin that you will need to make the head throbbing go away."
1,CD-Rom is marketed fraudulently,"The book itself is ok, not great. I give it one star for the vocabulary word list. It does not spend enough time talking about the all-important and very idiosyncratic ETS scoring algorithms. The real problem I have with this book, however, is with the way the CD-Rom is marketed. On the cover of the book there is a picture of a CD and it says ""3 computer-adaptive tests."" But it turns out that the CD is only a portal to the publisher's website. There are practice tests on the website but, contrary to the verbiage on the bookcover, they are not ""adaptive"" in any sense. In other words, the difficulty level of the questions never changes, rendering the whole ETS scoring algorithm invalid. In fact, I'm sure they do not even use the ETS scoring algorithm, but simply count up right and wrong answers. False advertsing - ARCO/Peterson's could probably be vulnerable to legal action for this kind of deception."
1,Footwear changes for the worse,"About 10 years ago, I purchased a pair of these Tevas and loved them. I ordered the exact same pair( style and size). When the arrived, they felt small. I measured them up against my old ones and they were 3/4 inch shorter. Also, they did not have the same padding on the straps. Overall, very shoddy workmanship. I have since purchased a pair of Ecco sandals that I am very happy with."
3,Trans-Siberian Rail Guide,"Published in 1987, much of the information is out of date. However, there are many good itinerary suggestions and travel tips as well as previous travel comments from years ago that are entertaining and informative.For an excellent account of history, personal profiles and recent traveling across Russia, I recommend ""Russia - A Journey to the Heart of a Land and its People"" by Jonathan Dimbleby."
3,Bought the wrong one,"Bought the wrong one...these don't fit the glass 5qt bowls. Should have known better, but I don't know KA stuff as well as the lady does. Oh well. Not worth returning, I'll just eventually get her the bowls that fit this...lol"
5,Handy,"This is a handy tool when you need to cover something like sugar cookies that need to go into the frig for an hour or overnight. You don't have to dirty another bowl, just put the lid on and go. If you make up some mashed potatos and want them to stay warm while finishing the rest of your meal, put the cover on and keep going. It is also good for those summer days when you might have that pesky fly flying around, or your pets running through the house and hair drifting around, just put the cover on and your food is safe."
2,Make sure you have the proper size,"I purchased two of these covers so that I could use it on the original and the secondary 6 qt KitchenAid bowls for theKitchenAid KP26M1XNP Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, Nickel Pearlthat I purchased.If you have the 5 qt mixer and bowl, these won't fit.These lids fit snugly over the mixing bowls, unless they get warped in the dishwasher.Although KitchenAid claims the cover is dishwasher safe, I find that not to be necessarily true.I washed one of the covers in the TOP rack of the dishwasher and now I cannot get it to fit the bowl. There was NO indication that it should have been handwashed only.The other cover smells awful, like 30 year old tupperware.I really wanted to like this item, but I don't."
3,Beware sizing,"These lids definitely do NOT fit the Professional HD 5 Quart model. They appear to be well made and exactly what I wanted, but I think they are made for a 6 quart model."
2,Kitchenaid 2 pack mixer bowl covers,the bowl covers did not fit snug and were not worth the price paid. Disappointed to say the least.
4,Good book,"This book was encouraging - good to know you're not alone in the fight against CFS. I wish it was more advice and less stories about all these other people, but it was relatively helpful. Good chapter for spouses."
1,Where are the papers?,I bought the Cambridge IELTS 3 Audio Cassette set and I got just that-2 cassettes! Where are the papers? Where is the listening question booklet? Can you please recommend which book I should buy to use these cassettes?
1,wrong title and description of product,"I though It was the new version of IELTS but it only a CD and to be usefull must have a questionary, where are the questions??. Amazon should cancel this product, is incompleted."
1,Have two of them and they both broke after a short while,"I got two of these alarm clocks in two different styles. They look great and the have great functions, but they both broke within less than a year or so.When I reported it to the company they said they do not repair the Zen Alarm clock, but would give me a new one for half the original retail cost plus $12.95 shipping per clock.They cost a lot originally Around 100 plus dollars so I felt somewhat cheated and insulted by their 50% of retail wholesale cost plus the expensive $12.95 shipping ""repair"" policy. To me it was not a repair policy at all.Having two of their products both break within a year or so just does not seem right to me. I wonder how many other people have experienced the Zen clock's electronic works just stop working.Sincerely,Dom"
5,Waking up is the best part of my day now!,"I used to use my phone as an alarm clock but that came with its own problems. For one, leaving my ringer on would wake me in the middle of the night if someone texted or e-mailed me. Secondly, I found myself getting used to certain alarm ringtones and literally sleeping right through them. The Zen Alarm Clock is a game changer! It's a whole new way to start my day and now waking up is a pleasure! The chime bar is soothing and gradually increases in volume until you awake. I've felt less tired at work since purchasing this and it has really helped improve my days & nights overall. Highly recommended!"
1,This CD bites the big one!,"I really despise every song on this CD. Adam Duritz is a raving megalomanical moron who wants to deafen us all with his incessant whining. And his hair is bad too. Mr. Jones and me is a perfect example. Gotta love that wonderful melodious music that induces bloody ears. Thanks for your time, Grand Iconoclast Otaku ""2"""
5,Without a doubt the best CD of the decade.,Counting Crows produced a debut album that may be near impossible to live up to. It will be interesting to see what they can come up with in the coming years.
4,"a familar sound, excellent","Counting crows sound isn't so much distintive as it is familar. ""Mr Jones"" is straight from the Van Morrison catolog, as are other songs. But there is something about the band. Adam Durnz's lyrics are memsmerising. His voice flows through the music like it was meant to be there all along. He is a storyteller and each song tells a different story. Beside that, the musical part of the album is very simple but very effective. Songs like ""Sullivan Street"" and ""Anna Begins"", contain very few chords but are played in such a way that the crows will leave you begging for more. Truly a classic, a must for everyone."
3,Only if you don't already have the standard edition,"It's not really worth the price of this ""Deluxe Edition"" if you already have August and Everything After. The live disc is nothing special and they've released live performances much better than this. The demo tracks on the first disc are pretty good and maybe worth purchasing as individual downloads, but it's hard to justify spending this much for just a couple pretty good tracks. Amazon's track listing isn't quite right at the moment, so FYI, on the first disc after the original 11 tracks are:12. Shallow Days (Acoustic Demo)13. Mean Jumper Blues (Acoustic Demo)14. Love and Addiction (Demo)15. Omaha (Demo)16. Shallow Days (Demo)17. This Land Is Your Land (Demo)"
2,Come on Adam!,"The Counting Crows are absolutely my favorite band, having said that I regret buying this cd. I paid $30 for a cd I already have and a bonus cd of Adam Duritz drunk in Paris. I have no idea why they chose the Paris concert when it is so apparently horrible. Every song is completely butchered and this bonus cd is nothing like the other live concerts the Counting Crows have released on cd. Believe me, you do not want to buy this cd!"
5,great music,"Most people have only heard of Mr. Jones and/or Round Here but those 2 songs should give you a pretty good idea of how good their music is. One thing I also truly enjoy about the music are the lyrics which are something else, very abstract and yet meaningful.Songs like Perfect Blue Buildings, Sullivan Street, and Anna Begins will definitely give you a true sense of appreciation of how good these musicians are. Definitely belongs to the ""one of the best albums"" category."
4,Not bad,"I ordered the blue/green and the colors are more like blue/tan. This is a light weight comforter set, good for spring or summer w/ the AC on. The quality is good. Although, I did get the queen size for my queen bed and it was a bit small (BARELY OVERLAPS THE SIDES) and it does look better in the picture but really not bad at all for $20."
2,Tough Start,"It just seemed that some of the first few chapters were redundant; like pages were just trying to be filled to create this book. Around chapter 7, the book starts to open up to information about actually cruising and I am finding useful information from an experience and knowledgeable cruiser. But the first six were rough."
2,Not a practical sourse of information,"Ok if you need som basic advice about making a decision to live aboard. Mostly it is posturing by the author and not much by way of real information, or thought provoking stories."
3,"Not an A-list book, perhaps a C?","Like J. Shurin, I gave this book a chance, and found it wanting. The characters varied in keeping my interest, and several seemed to fade away into oblivion without ever having been fully fleshed out. The plot was interesting, but not compelling. Overall, a good read if you are in between other books and are looking for some mild entertainment, with some rare witty dialogue."
2,A man's viewpoint on sex and death (and is there any other?),"We are as fascinated by death as we are inclined to ignore it.This book offers a look into what we find fascinating, but be advised: there is no small amount of voyeurism involved and the authortakes a man's view which means that he has little sympathy for eyes other than his own. This is not Jessica Mitford.It's a male failing to fail to see things from a woman's point of view. Most women, who have learned since childhood to read as men read and to see as men see will likely not mind. Not overmuch."
5,A wonderful way to look at DEATH and life.,"In this book the reader may experience many types of feelings. From it being funny to almost making you want to cry. It grabs the reader, wanting to finish this book in one sitting."
3,Till Death Do Us Part,"Lynch's compilation of stories of his townspeople, his experiences, and his personal views on life and death would make a person think differently on how these important issues affect one's life. Through my readings, I have found that Lynch truly respects his job. As a funeral director, Lynch has encountered many usual and unusual deaths in his town of Milford, Michigan. One can only imagine the hardships and duties of a funeral director. I would find it especially difficult to perform any embalming, burying, or cremating on close friends and or family. Mr. Lynch had to go through that with his father and others as well. Overall, Lynch completed this work with a smooth finish and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in the funeral direction service."
1,Even prayers didnt help this Biblical Garden,"I diligently followed the directions... To the letter... And it was still a disasterous failure. Nothing grew. I tried it a second time, more meticulous than before but had the same result. This is the only plant thing that hasn't grown for me. So much for praying for success!Avoid this like one of the Biblical plagues!"
5,"Subtle, Well Written, Well Directed","I'm glad this well written, well directed, and well acted movie is finally out on DVD."
4,"Effective, but costly product.","I bought the Leappad Advantage...which included the Leappad, MindStation, and a 6-month membership to Leap's Pond Magazine and Leap's Activity Sheets. This is an excellent product with great educational value, BUT only having ONE cartridge is really starting to get on my nerves. Luckily for me I only have one child using this 'system' and trying to work with only one cartridge is really annoying. The download isn't exactly what I would call 'quick', so having to download the sheets and the magazine's SEPARATELY (which can only be played with one at a time) doesn't even make sense. The MindStation should come with a MINIMUM of THREE cartridges to make it more convenient. I have read that additional cartridges are available, but I haven't seen any. And hopefully when I do find them, they won't cost me [alot]."
1,DOES NOT COME WITH EVERY THING NEEDED.,"when I purchased this product it asked me if I would like to purchase the required batteries. Eight dollar batteries at that. My mind station has know place to put batteries, it requires an ac adapter, which is not even offered. So my review is this, it might be a wonderful product if we were able to use it."
1,NOT INCLUDED!,"This is supposed to be an excellent product . . . BUT, since it requires an AC adapter (which IS NOT INCLUDED) I haven't been able to use the product yet. (How silly to sell something without all the necessary items!) My advice! Open the box and check to see what is included before you bring it home - NO WHERE ON THE BOX DID IT SAY IT NEEDED AN AC ADAPTER THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED! I'm hoping this is worth all the extra trip to the store to get an adapter. (As for the ""stars"" for this review . . . who knows???? It was a required field)"
4,Where are the cartridges?,"These are very educational toys, and my chlidren really enjoy them and cannot put them down. I purchased the Turbo Twist Spelling for my 8 year old and the Leap Pad Learning System for my 4 year old. The only problem I have with them is finding additional cartridges for the mind station. We have two toys and one cartridge. This has caused a problem with my children because they both want to use the cartridge. I have exhausted my search to find additional cartridges. If the cartridges were made available in toy stores, I would absolutely give it 5 stars. They are great learning toys."
1,Leapfrog has removed the site this device needs!,"Leapfrog no longer supports this device and has removed all the parts of their website needed to allow it to operate.Even after downloading the most current software, setting up a new account ect... the device is unable to connect.It's not that they just don't support the product any longer, They have actually broken it remotely by making it entirely dependent on a website that they took down."
5,The greats toy i ever bought my kids,I own 4 leap pad toys and all of them use the mind station and i think they are great the baby never runs out of pages to color and my son is always ready for a spelling test and my daughter can study for tests in 3 diffrent subjects. even there teachers like the way it works with there books. And they are always studing i never thought i would ever see my kids study as much as they do and have fun doing it.
1,Content delivery problems,"In regards to content for the Leap Pad, the concept is good, but activity delivery is terrible. I don't have a slow computer, but the activity sheets take forever to print, the audio tracks take all day to download, and it's simply impossible to get the sheets aligned on the Leap Pad toy. It would be a little less offensive if you could download audio and print the activity pages at the same time. It would also be helpful if there were better instructions available for aligning the printed pages on the toy. All in all, it's a lot of money for questionable content."
3,It was ok...,I got this one in white. I used this to wear under my wedding dress. I wore a jacket but was worried that the lace would still be to see-through so I cut the sleeves and used it to line my jacket. Worked out great! The material could be better quality. It's like wearing really cheap tights.
3,"Good, but not great","In what appears to be an effort to keep up with the sounds of the mid-'80s, Quarterflash's third effort is awash with the sounds of layered synthesizers. The trademark saxophone is still here, and, thankfully, Rindy Ross sings lead on all of the tracks. ""Walking on Ice,"" ""Talk to Me,"" and ""Love without a Net (You Keep Falling),"" the album's highlight, are good, solid, driving rock tunes. In fact, this album is more consistent than Quarterflash's two previous albums, and there really aren't any poor songs here (although ""Come to Me"" comes shockingly close to sounding like Miami Sound Machine), but there aren't any great ones, either, making it easy to see why this was the least well-received of Quarterflash's three American albums."
3,Pretty good for the money,"I used this book to re-inforce a class I was taking, and it did help me to retain some very basic German. I would recommend this to someone who wanted to travel, as the book is rather geared towards a reader who wants to travel and have a basic working knowledge of the language. The book does not bring you up to the level of mastery or advanced grammar or anything, but it does do what it claims, to get you to the point of understanding and producing basic language so that a native speaker could give you directions, or some help while traveling around Germany. I gave it 3 stars because I found some of the listening exercises to be manufactured, not really realistic natural conversations. It is useful though. However, I will say that you need to devote some real time into actually doing the exercises, you won't pick much up in one week with the book."
3,a wonderful book about the hardships of a life without order,"This book brought to light so many things that happen when a father is not present and women must raise a child in the harshness of poverty. I think that because this book was not read over and over, and changed, it made it that much better. If it had been it might have lost the substance that makes it great. The reason i read this book was because in my world literature class we were told to read three books by one author. I chose Albert Camus because the titles of his book seemed to be interesting. But instead of reading 3 books i read almost all of them.The First Man is by far the best."
3,Broke with light use,"My kids didn't find this as enjoyable as I hoped. They are both avid learners but this just didn't have much entertainment value. Within one year, the tip of the pen broke off and now the toy is useless. I keep it around for occasional use until we buy a ""dumb"" globe :)"
4,Great leaning tool but could be better,"Great, fun way to learn for all ages (adults too!), but the stylus proved a little fragile (you can replace it) and any countries along the equator are hard to select because of the tape. Overall good, and the whole family have improved their global geography skills!"
2,Great concept-but not to happy with product,"I am now returning my 2nd globe. The first one came apart(only held together with a small strip of tape) and once it is apart you can not get the inside peices to match correctly.So I got a second one. The voice is all messed up, it talks when it's not being played with, and it says the wrong thing when you press different parts.(even with new batteries)..I am going to try one more-b/c we had so much fun with it before the first one came apart (after the first time we played with it)!!!! Good luck"
4,"I love it, hope my kids did too","The product is great. Like others reviewers said... the pen in the weakest point, it looks like it will break anytime... and sometimes the globe responds without being touched by the pen... But the information is great, the games are fun, I love it. My girls, 5 and 10, like it, not as much as me though. It is a bit too hard, but I hope this will be an excellent learning tool for them. I think the more they play, the better they will become, and the more they will enjoy it.Anyway, overall, I love it, hope the kids will love it too. After trying it, if I had to make the decision now about buying the product, would buy it again."
5,A World of Fun,"The learning Globe has provided my grandson's, aged 6 & 5, many hours of fun and learning.They have learned so much about the continents and capitals of the many countries they ""visit"". It is one of their favorite toys. The only problem is that I need to study up on my knowledge of the world now!!!!!"
5,dreeeeeeem pop,"this is the best dream pop album ever(maybe along with cocteau twins heaven or las vegas).it has everything that dream pop was/should be.first the guitars: echos, chorus, some distortion. this is pure late 80s early 90s folks. the sounds are good, but the arrangments are amazing. see: goodbye, 24 hours, wild horses.now on to the vocals. hot damn.harriet: the voice. gentle, soft, acrobatic at times. hitting up high in cloudy registers. her melodies are on point. see: 24 hours, love, on earth, i feel fine.her lyrics are straight genius, witty but not as snotty as reading writing...they are bit subdued, yet sharp. they hit you hard, they speak of the human condition more than on ""reading"""
4,"superior beauty and catchy, too","I didn't care much for the album's 7 other songs, but the first 5 are SO good!!! Listen to the samples (those are most of the best ones) and I doubt you'll disagree that her sweet voice melds perfectly with the heavily reverbed guitars...great harmonies. If you consider 5 excellent songs (out of an album with 12), to be a good musical buy, then we have a winner."
5,great entertainment,"Excellent flick!!! Maurice Chevalier and Charles Boyer steal the show with their antics. One has the feeling everyone had a geat time making this film. The Score was also done very well. Rome's music was excellently adapted to fit this non-musical version. I have the soundtrack on LP, but wish so much it would get released on CD."
5,Fanny,"This movie had everything in it love story, lovalty, heartbreak..It had a very happy ending. I enjoyed it immensely..The fact that I got it on Amazon for a very low price made it all so worth it..."
5,Just Brilliant,"I saw this film years ago and have been waiting ever since to see it again. It is just brilliant, do see it and enjoy one of the most romantic films ever. It is Leslie Caron at her best."
5,"Beautiful, crisp, and oh-so-cute!","Wonderful photos. The paper is a decent weight, fairly standard for calendars, and it has a nice satin finish. The photos range from very natural, (a pig in the grass with little yellow flowers growing nearby), to the whimsical, (a pig sticking it's head out of a basket while wearing a silly hat). I'm not always one for animals in costumes, but only one photo is that way, and it is not over done. Most of the pictures are adorable piggies in natural settings, a few in settings with blankets or buckets, and one with the pig in a hat."
4,Satisfied,"I was happy with the purchase, but it is a gift for a family member. I'm sure they'll be satisfied with it also."
1,Horrible,"This game was simply horrendous. Above all, i hated the level design. I played for about an hour and had to quit due to crappy level design. It was extremely dark and gloomy. I could never see any natural light in any levels. It was a huge disappointment and I am grateful that the game wasn't mine and I didn't have to buy it."
1,Played the demo and saved myself $40,"The graphics in this game aren't all that much of an improvement, but the game is incredibly choppy. Did Eidos use the UT2003 enging? I doubt it. I'm saving up to buy the GeForce FX 5700 Ultra, so Deus Ex 2 had better not be choppy at all. I've got a fast pc with a gig of PC3200 ram, so when I buy and install the 5700 Ultra, I'd better see 30 fps or more, or there is something seriously wrong with this game's engine."
1,Buyer beware,"Unless you want to spend big bucks on some state of the art video card, don't bother with this game. Be aware that the hardware requirements are entirely misleading."
1,Unuser Friendly.,"As a story-teller I was eager to play this game for the wide possinilities of scenarios. As a game I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions. Only in game play was I able to move my character. Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt. If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo. That was just a waste of space. I also felt limited by the small selection of tools. Not even the cheat codes would entirely work. For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips. The guns themselves were not even very good. The sniper rifle didn't ""snipe."" The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak. I should have bought Halo when I had the chance."
1,"Technically defective, and Eidos support is useless","The game does not run against many ATI graphics cards - no doubt a feature of their nVidia preference program - and the copy protection is defective. We worked with Eidos tech support, and they finally gave up and said SecuRom is working on a fix. How comforting. No timeframe for resolution offered.We'll see if Amazon refunds for defective software or not."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was so excited to get this game for christmas...Unfortunately, I did not read the fine print on the back of the box.Heck I bought this computer less than a year ago, should run the game right?WRONG!!!!This game is VERY selective about the graphic cards it will play on. Unfortunately, I now have a $40.00 coaster... or I can invest in a new card.I am wiser now, I won't buy an Eidos game anytime soon."
3,A Medieval Defense of Bibliophilia,"Bishop Richard De Bury's mid-14th century defense of his bibliophilia expresses the overwhelming enthusiasm for books and knowledge shared by book-lovers of all eras. I found some of his Medieval Roman Catholicism to be off-putting (e.g. viewing women as nothing but evil seductresses, practically worshiping Aristotle as the source of all wisdom prior to the New Testament, placing Mary on almost the same level as God, etc.), but overall it was an enjoyable read. His flowery Medieval style occasionally came off as a bit extravagant/melodramatic, but I found it amusing rather than irritating. One of my favorite quotes that sums up the entire book: ""Certes, just as we have learnt on the authority of Seneca, leisure without letters is death and the sepulture of the living, so contrariwise we conclude that occupation with letters or books is the life of man."""
3,Decent,"Took an exceptable amount of time to reach my house, I really dont remember it was a while back but I got it. The case was broken but really didnt matter. I got what I wanted in one piece, Music."
4,"not punk, but great","this is one of my favorite albums, but please guys don't start calling it hardcore or punk, cause its not.though this album is not quite as grundge as other albums by nirvana, it has a style unlike other bands. kurt cobaine had balls to produce this album, and i admiire him because of his style and the way he is. as a huge nirvana fan, I would defenately say this album is good, except for songs like molly's lips and some other horribly punk wannabe song, which doesnt spoil the albumMy favorite songs on the album- hairspray queen- this is suck a wicked song, i hum it cause i still don't know the words. the vocals are awesome- dive- its just a good song, very catchy-turnaround- this is by far the song with the best lyrics that i have ever heard. its why i love nirvana so much, and to top it off the melody is good too.-"
5,A better bleach,"Incesticide reminds me of Bleach. It has the same raw feel. The songs though, are much better and sound more experienced. The first half has the more radio-friendly songs(not that they are at all) and the second half has a lot of screaming. From Dive, you know that this is not going to be Nevermind. Its a good buy if you like Nirvana a lot and can tolerate a lot of screaming songs. If you like Bleach or In Utero, you will probably like it. If you've just heard Nevermind and liked it, you can't really predict it. It takes a little while to get into it. Give it a chance. Once you do, its hard to get sick of...probably the hardest."
2,More misses than hits...,"Although Incesticide contains Sliver, Dive, and Molly's Lips (by the Vaselines) which are all excellent. The rest of the CD however is not very good at all. Some of the songs are too boring or repetitive. Fans of In Utero might like this one, but if you like the great melodies and excellent lyrics of Nevermind and Unplugged you should skip this one."
1,DDDisguisting!!!!!!!!!!! Where's the 0-star slot????,"That ""song"" Beeswax is disguisting. It says that Kurt has got his...omph spayed! It has all sorts of other bad and offensive lyrics. Hairspray Queen is a perverted and irritating noise. Mexican Seafood is bad too. Complete with lyrics that refer to a yeast infection and Kurt's health problems (foot fungas,dandruff,diahrrea,etc.). So don't get this CD. It's gross. And it's the one with the warning sticker and explicit lyrics, not In Utero!"
4,took me awhile to like this album,"on first listening to this album i thought it sounded pretty lame. But then this album soon started to grow on me and now i think incesticide kicks ass! Its got a nice garage band sound to it, its got some fun pop songs like son of a gun(a cover of the vasileins song), but then its got some heavy songs like downer. give this album a chance,after all these songs were performed before nirvana became the biggest band of the 90s. it is a worthy addition to your CD collection"
3,Lots of pictures but skimpy on details.,"Apart from the scary, unappeasing cover, the book is nice. Good addition to keep out to see and browse for the wonderful pictures. Another great thing are the sidenotes that are quite informative and detailed. The maps are GREAT, albiet slightly less detailed. There are no walking or trekking maps within this guide.I would have preferred more details on each area. For example more detailed itineraries, or walking itineraries. Also, no trekking information is available in the text. No info on Kashmir in this one either!An okay book. I rather prefer the other guidebook ""Pakistan Handbook"". Less pictures in that one, but much more details."
4,More than enough.,"This study guide was more than enough to help me pass the exam. I only took one of the practice exams in the back. I simply read the material, and took notes. Definately worth the price."
4,Really not too bad for a trashy road movie,"I'm with M. Biggs, I found this movie grabs your interest and one of the rare straight to DVD/TV movies that I enjoyed. There's an interesting dimension to the main character in the way he fights against his own violence. It's a good scene where he revisits his childhood and the memory of it breaks his resolve to be good, and the imagery of him receding into the dark to prepare us for the last scenes is nicely done. I'll also give my interpretation of the ending as a comment."
1,Poor editing and straight-to-dvd acting,"Wound up watching this one night when I had a bad bout of insomnia. The whole plot didn't make much sense. The writer should have spent more time on the script. I would chock that up to mediocre writing and bad editing. Miner and Kane's characters were not as developed as a viewer would hope; and, yes, I agree with many others that Miner's attempt at a Southern accent was poor. When I got to the end of the movie, it actually took me a few minutes to figure out just what the hell happened. The whole ""are they, or aren't they dead"" thing was just dumb. All the earmarks of a straight to vid movie: lame plot, bad acting and a gratuitous sex scene -- that somehow didn't show a whole lot (go figure).In short, skip this one. You'd be better off watching Warren Beatty's 'Bonnie and Clyde' or even ""Last Man Standing"". This one is for hardcore Kane fans only."
4,Much improvement!,A huge improvement over book 1. The action got moving quickly and continue through out. I even call this one laugh out loud funny. Due to the deep character development in book one I was able to really bond with Robert in this book. I also love Monette his best friend and this book makes me really dislike the sterotypical gay friend Michael. I was so happy that Robert was able to fall in love. Like more gay men then most realize there are gay men out there that believe true love exist and to see Robert have that for a time was touch. I would recommend this for a good easy summer read.
2,Personally A Little Bit Deceiving,"Naturally the term ""DVD"" suggested to me something visual. Not the case here: it's an audio recording on a digital video disc. I'm not quite sure what's the point, as most people already have CD players with fine sound. What's here is a music concert without visuals playing through the DVD speakers. That understood, the performance of the 14 Bach excerpts is uniformly beautiful."
1,Honolulu City Lights CD,"Unfortunately, the CD would not play, and further unfortunate that I set it aside and didn't get it returned within the stated 30-day period. I had just heard him in person and purchased another CD - wish I'd gotten this one instead. I had this same cassette from many years ago when I lived in Hawaii! Auwe."
3,Au Contraire,"I don't mean to ruin the five-star party, especially given that a number of good friends of mine do love this album. But, despite the fact that I really liked Undone, Buddy Holly, and Say It Ain't So on the radio, I just have a hard time listening to this album and getting into it. Weezer seems stuck in a rut stylistically-- every song has the same heavy guitar sound, mixed in with the occassional light acoustic guitar. While other bands do the same thing without it getting really bothersome, Weezer's sound grates on me after a few songs. That said, Holiday and Garage are good songs, and you probably already like the singles if you're reading this. But for what it's worth, the bulk of the album doesn't do anything for me that the singles didn't. 3 and a half stars."
3,Lyrics are far more memorable than the music,"WEEZER is a triumph of lyrical sophistication trapped in acceptable but less than memorable music. There is a general familiarity in many of the songs, each containing a simple melody that support the insightful and exceptional lyrics adequately, but don't do them complete justice. When the music does live up to the lyric, like on ""Undone,"" ""Buddy Holly,"" and ""In the Garage"" the results are captivating and memorable. This is a CD where the focus is on what is being said and how it is sung, the music is a bit player and that does not make for the most satisfying listen. These variations on teen angst, with their outsider feel are truly wonderful; I just don't find the tunes that go with them quite as memorable as the words."
5,Weezer,This is where it began. There is no cd I love more than this one. I have other bands I like more but this cd tops them. Say it ain't so has to be one of the best songs I've heard. Well for rock it is.
5,the Blue Album: Where it all began,"Weezer is my favorite band. I started liking them as soon as I bought this CD, their first effort, which was released in 1994. Each track is excellently written and sung by lead singer Rivers Cuomo and played just as well by the rest of the band. At no point does the album become monotonous or repetitive; each track has a distinctive sound of its own. I recommend this album as one of the best I have ever listened to."
5,Unbelievable,"Weezer is the greatest band to ever be assembled every one of thier songs is awesome, I can listen to it all day and not be tired of it."
5,One Of The Best,"Weezer kicks a**! This CD has got to be one of the greatest of all time. From the hard-rocking/fun-loving opener, ""My Name is Jonas,"" to the surprisingly emotional ""Only in Dreams,"" Weezer delivers a full-force barage of great alternative punk. Their other album, ""Pinkerton,"" is also a great CD. BUY THEM!"
5,Definitely one of the BEST CDs of all time!!!!!!,"Weezer is a living phenomenon! My bro first got the cd about 3 years ago. When I bought the Third Eye Blind cd, he said ""If you like them, you'll LOVE Weezer."" And love I do. When I first listened to it I couldn't stop and I still can't. Now, me and my bro fight over the cd because we both love it so much! I even went out and bought they're second cd Pinkerton, which is awesome too! They have great voices to fit there great songs. They're lyrics aren't like any other, they are about their lives and simple little things nobody would ever think of. They are totally all American and unique in an appealing way. They will always be one of my ultimate favorite groups!!"
1,"to tell u the truth, i'd give it 0 stars",THIS BAND IS SOOOOO BORING. JUST LOOK AT THE COVER AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN. LOOK AT DOOKIE(GREEN DAY) AND YOU WILL SEE A CREATIVE COVER. DO NOT BUY WEEZER BACAUSE THEY SOUND LIKE THEY ARE WEEZING WHEN THEY SING.
5,WEEZER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WEEZER IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE BAND THERE IS. ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ON IT ARE COOL. I DONT CARE TOO MUCH FOR ""THE WORLD HAS TURNED AN LEFT ME HERE"", CUS I THINK IT'S SAD AN THE REST OF THE CD IS HAPPY TO ME AN FUN. BUT MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE""THE SWEATER SONG"",""SAY IT AIN'T. AND ""ONLY I DREAMS"" I LOVE HOW THEY PUT IT IN THE END OF THE CD CUS IT REALLY FILLS AT THE WHOLE CD. IT'S THE BEST. I BOUGHT THIS CD 3 YEARS AGO AND BROKE IT CUS IT WAS MESSED UP. AT FIRST I DID'NT LIKE ALL THE SONGS ON IT BUT THEN 3 YEARS LATER I GOT IT AGIAN AND HEARD ALL THE SONGS FOR A 2ND TIME AN GOT TOTAL HOOKED.THERE SONGS ARE EASY TO REMEMBER AN EASY TO SING.THEY STAY IN YOUR HEAD. MY FRIEND DOES'NT LIKE'EM BUT I DONT KNOW WHY. HE SAYS ""THEY SUCK"" BUT I THINK THEY RULE!!IF IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M SAYING STUFF THAT EVERY ONE ELES IS SAYING THEN THAT SHOULD TELL U SOME THING. THAT WEEZER IS YHE BEST. I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT.AN CANT WAIT FOR THEIR 3RD NEW CD. SO BUY THE CD.LOVE IT.!!!!!!!!!"
5,Bomb Diggity,This CD is a classic and I am sure my kids will listen to it when they grow up. Definitely one of my favorite rock albums of all time. Say It Ain't So and Undone are really great songs. Get this CD.
4,Summertime...,"This album was a pleasant surprise when it was first released... a garage band with a sense of humour (and lacking true novelty status, thank God) and great taste with regard to their influences.As we all know, ""Buddy Holly"" became famous due to their masterful Spike Jonze video, but also because it was a great summer song. It was rock 'n' roll for the 90s, but you could trace a line from it straight to Buddy himself (RIP), who was probably smiling from on high when it was released.LP length as well, wisely avoiding the 'filler-four' tunes most bands usually tack on to their debut CD just to give it more value; ""In the Garage"", ""My Name is Jonas"", ""Surf Wax America""... this is a disc that was tailor-made for booming out of a Cutlass convertible circa '67.Will it be a classic in 20 years? Only time will tell. But I still enjoy it today, and I have a feeling I'm not alone on that score."
3,I Can't Believe I Read The Whole Thing!,"I tried to overlook the fact that this book was written over two decades ago. I suppose if I had read it when it came out it might have been a page turner.The characters were believable enough, but the plot wasn't. You pick a guy for a controversial sub-committee, add a bunch of corrupt politicians and businessment (are there any other kind?) and all hell breaks loose. Add in some unbelievable circumstances (gee, from America's top hated to America's next President) and you get a book that for some reason kept me reading for a couple of weeks.I should have followed by instincts and dropped it."
3,Some sparkles between filth,"There are a handful of songs which show Moore elevating distortion to merge with infectiously sweet melodies to an inspired degree, but the album is still weighed down heavily with annoying, shallow experimentation, often embodied by Gordon's guttural groaning."
5,Some of the best military sci-fi available,"I read this about two summers ago, and have never forgotten it. If you're a fan of Military Sci-Fi, you need to read this; it's one of the best I've ever read (I'm 60, and a constant reader). The realism is incredible; David Drake paints a vivid picture with a minimum of words, and those words carefully chosen for maximum impact. Several interwoven/related short stories (and some much longer ones) follow these mercenary soldiers over several planets and locales, fighting because it's what they do, with no personal stake in it. It's just business. Hard business. Do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK! There's plenty more of Mr. Drake's stuff out there, once your appetite has been whetted with this one. You'll have discovered a new favorite author."
2,Mostly great but felt cheated with the ending,"I liked this book. I liked the hard scifi, military action and creative alien enemies. Author had me engrossed through most of the book with a very creative plot and colorful narration. First chapter had me hooked and I invested in the book and enjoyed the read until the end. There isnt and ending really and no payoff for the reading investment. It strikes the me author had to make a deadline and wrote a 5 page ending to wrap up the prior 300 pages. I was so invested and wanted to know where things were going I felt cheated and angry after reading the conclusion and can only give it 2 stars. Investment in a couple of chapters to provide a comprehensive and satisfying conclusion would have made this a 5 star book."
5,David does it again,"Like Dave Drake, I'm a Vietnam veteran. This story speaks to me on so many levels. I can relate well to the characters, and the scenario. Thanks Dave."
3,An OK Read,"The book opens with a rolling sequence of mini-scenes - most only two or three sentences long - that describe Company 41's assault on a world called Maxus 377, a chaos of good guys shooting at the bad guys in an operation that makes absolutely no tactical sense at all. Landing a company on a hostile planet without low-earth-orbit, close-air or heavy-weapons support? I'm no mud-pounder - I'm ex-navy - but that seems very ill-advised. As it turns out.Anyway, it rattles on from there until a bit of a damp squib of an ending.On the positive side, the biota of Company 41's next assignment is very well done; a triumph of imagination. Loved the nasties.Overall, less action and more plot and more character development. And, please, fewer two-sentence paragraphs."
3,not the best example,"If by any chance this is your first Agatha Raisin read, put it down and start earlier in the series. While these stories are technically cozies, they have much more wit and bite than others I've read. Unlike the other books in this series, Terrible Tourist is 95% soap opera about Agatha's (often funny and very wry) obsession with James Lacey, and 5% ""mystery"". I, like many, will forgive Agatha basically anything, so I read this book with pleasure. But if it had been the first one I had picked up in the series, I don't know that I would have been inspired to read any more, and that would have been a great loss, to me. I am thrilled I discovered this series so late in the game, because I have all of these books to look forward to. Terrible Tourist just wouldn't be at the top of my list."
2,"Long winded, predictable, labored","The other reviews of this book have pretty much covered the story line. M C Beaton is struggling to make a story out of this murder, and she labors too long over it. Agatha has too many close calls that are not believable and a story line that is full of holes--any detective in real life would have solved this murder in 24 hours. M C Beaton, like so many other popular authors (e.g., the old Robert Parker), is being forced to write books at too rapid a pace without time to properly think out the story line or do the necessary rewriting. I will miss Macbeth and Raisin if they blunder off into stupidity."
3,Agatha seems annoying,"Agatha Raisin doesn't seem like anyone I would want to know. She is indecisive at times and rude at other times and drinks copiously. She has an obsession with James that is embarrassing to the female sex. The entire group of tourists who are the characters in this book would embarrass me if I were British. Much detail is given as to the towns and tourist sights and Agatha visits them, usually for no reason in particular. She doesn't seem to have any theory as to the perpetrator although we are told that she is an amateur detective. I was left with sympathy for Cyprus if these are the typical tourists that visit."
5,Secrets of the Dead - Amazon Warrior Women,"A truly execellent DVD presentation. Factual, compelling, and timely.Should be made into a book. It helps to redress the issue of the importanceof women in ancient societies."
1,barely worth the time it takes to watch!,"not only was this poorly done as a documentary, most of it seems to play out as a wwe promo video with lots of a-typical aggressive rap and ""metal"" music playing during most match highlights. this video is not even close to being as professional, atmospheric, and entertaining as ""the smashing machine"" and ""choke"". altogether it may be worth a rent (depending on if you think you can tolerate the horribly overdubbed music), but is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH BUYING!!! the only redeeming quality about this dvd is the interviews with some of the fighters like jackson, cotoure, and randleman- but then the film turns right around and portrays a meat-headed view of the sport. not good at all. anyone with a camera and access to the fighters could have accomplished the same product."
5,Good product!,"Great deal on desktop memory. Glad I found it, I could have spent much more somewhere else! Would buy more!"
1,Probably i'm unlucky,"I bought this product to upgrade from 512MB 667 RAM. After the upgrade, my computer ran slower than before and i got the blue screen a few time. When checking back, i found that each of the 1GB modules only showed up as 512MB. And with the two installed, windows only showed 1GB. The blue screen was cause by one of the ram sticks suddenly dropping off.Summary: paid for 2GB, got 1GBOne of the modules has a fault."
2,The voice of privilege,"Here it is, folks, the voice of privilege: Guggenheim endorsed, Connecticut hip, Brown University hip hoo ha. Would you want your children to read this book, or your uncle, or yourself? Purple is as purple does. Demonology ideed. Hawthorne's the one."
4,better than ring of angels,"Though endlessly influential from the get-go, Rick Moody's works have evolved considerably. If Purple America felt over-stylized to you, check out Demonology or his subsequent autobiography The Black Veil. They are especially powerful if read in that order. The title story of Demonology alone is worth the cost, and I can believe Moody's claim in an interview that after writing it he has been unable to re-read it. It is a very painful account of his sister's death, thinly veiled in fiction (thin to the point that the narrator comments on the story's autobiographical tint). The reviewers who argue that Moody changes tone too quickly and explicitly gives clues of impending disaster miss the point; the tragedy is a given. The beauty of his prose is in building up the context, prolonging what everyone knows or senses from foreshadowing and from the story's mood, until it reaches the point that he must resign himself to writing the conclusion. It is a beautiful method."
2,the 3rd or 4th worst writer of his generation,"The most appealing thing about this book is the candy on the cover. These stories are, in a word, dull. No memorable characters. No gripping--or even mildly interesting--plots.One editorial review in praise of this book is telling. It calls the collection ""finely crafted"" which I suppose is roughly equivalent to praising a movie for its cinematography: it's fine if you're in to that sort of thing, but don't expect too much in the way of entertainment.In my opinion, it's Rick Moody's ""style"" that is largely to blame for the crappiness of this book. A guy in a chicken suit crashing a wedding ought to be interesting. But in Rick Moody's meandering, digressive prose, even this quirky scenario manages to become quite tiresome.If you enjoy overblown language and slim plots, you may enjoy this book. I give it two stars because it's mediocre and forgettable rather than offensively bad."
2,no sound,"I like sonic youth, and i know they are experimental, but there was no music at all here. This wont even fit into my cd player. Its just a rectangular mass of paper!"
5,Perfectly Told,"Wonderful book that really gives you a clear idea of Sonic Youth's goals, passions and beginning. Nothing is left out, and you feel as tho you were there with them. It's definitely a must read for the Sonic Youth fan. It'll get you hooked on this band if you're not a fan already."
4,Sugartooth,"I first heard of Sugartooth back in the early nineties, there was a video played MTV. There are many good songs though some are similar in vocal structure. I originally bought the cassette in 1995. I found it recently while looking though some old stuff. I decided to replace the cassette with a CD since iTunes does not carry this music. If you like early nineties grunge rock, you should give this a try."
2,Lacking,"The cartoons are funny, but there are only 14 and they run about a minute each. All in all, this really isn't worth paying for when you only get about 20 minutes of material not counting the extra features. You might as well just watch them online."
4,"For the most part, it does what it should.","I used this burner with Roxio Toast software and was happy with the results. In order to minimize ""coasters"" I would burn the disc to an image file on the computer first, and then burn discs from the image file. Internal drives are always better because the data isn't going through a connection like USB, but for an external DVD solution this drive from Iomega is reliable."
4,Great Music!!,If you're feeling down or just want to mellow out for the evening this cd will do it for you. Mae Moore is a master at feel-good music. A good compliment to the Dragonfly cd also by Mae Moore.
4,Excellent mais moins que les précédents,"Avec Daydream Nation, Sonic Youth se réinventent, ils adoptent un nouveau son... plus commercial. Bien sr l'album est truffé de passage rappelant la sonorité organique et grafignée du trop bon vieux matériel (Confusion is Sex / Kill yr. idol, Evol, Bad moon Rising, Sister...) mélange d'humus automnal d'une fort mixte et d'effluves pubères de crasse de plancher d'un squat frisquet où l'on se réchauffe en se blotissant entre amis sincères. Mais pour le reste, Sonic Youth nous amène dans des territoires beaucoup moins riches (c'est ce que mes trippes me disent...)Dans le matériel subséquent, j'aime bien Dirty, A Thousand Leaves et NYC Ghost & Flowers, si a peut vous aider à savoir si vous devez considérer mon opinion ou pas. Je donne quand mme 4 étoiles parce que c'est un album très excellent, seulement, c'est la fin du meilleur et le début du plus ordinaire. En ce sens, on peut le considérer comme un condensé de l'oeuvre de Sonic Youth."
5,One of the best records of the past decade,"Sonic Youth's ""Daydream Nation"" is for my money not only the best SY album, but the best rock record or just record period in the past decade or so of good old rock n' roll, or 'alternative', if you must, since anything electrified passes as an alternative to good music nowadays. From the great and unforgettable ""Teenage Riot"" to ""Trilogy"" and the fantastic ""Providence"", this is an album that was ahead of it's time them, and stands the test of time now. The fantastic guitar structures and dynamics of the songs make for an absolute treat for the ears and mind. Too bad the following SY albums, with the exception of ""Dirty"" and ""A Thousand Leaves"" didn't match up to the brilliance on this, and their albums preceding this one. If this record isn't part fo your collection, your collection isn't complete."
1,Generic Top 40 rock,"Sonic Youth are basically what is wrong with music nowadays. The rely on computerized Auto-Tune vocals, 4/4 rhythm, repetitive guitar riffs and immature lyrics about breakups for their fame. Thurston Moore is a horrible guitarist and Kim Gordon can't sing for her life without the use of computers. Check out Nickelback, Tokio Hotel, new Metallica or Seether for some good old fashioned rock n' roll the way it SHOULD be."
3,"Overpraised, but massively influential nonetheless","Although DN is praised as one of the greatest early alternative records and Sonic Youth's finest moment, I always felt that it was one of those albums praised more for the unhinged distortion it potently represented than actual songwriting content. Albums later on would incorporate melody more successfully without compensating their trademark production edge."
2,Vastly Over-rated!,"I've read dozens of DP's books, & believe me, there was nothing much likable/memorable in this story except for the ending! I remember nothing much about this book other than its brief summary & ending & that reading this one was mostly a waste of my time! Please believe me when I say that many of her older books have been vastly over-rated & outrageously over-priced on this website! (So, borrow as many of her books as U can from the public library system before ever ordering any of DP's! I have bitterly regretted buying many of her books that have received the 5 star reviews on this Website.... The really good ones written by DP R books like the Diamond Girl, Beloved, Cotrain's Proposal, Lord of the Desert, Hoodwinked, Soldier of Fortune, & some of Under His Spell series....)"
5,Arc Angels,"Had thiss cd for 10 years or so,great rock n roll,the band is just fatastic as you would expect with these guys,play loud grab a beer and have some fun."
1,and...,"and tna has guys that CAN go alot better then guys in wwe like aj styles, christopher daniels, and chris sabin, guys you probably havent heard of because you never watch any non wwe shows! heres another good company...roh!!! have any of you ever watched roh? probably not."
3,GAB 2005 Backkground rock music,"One reviewer here said there was some rock music playing in the background during the ppv that sounded like an actual song being sung by an actual band, though WWE did not announce it like they usually do. I agree with that reviewer on his review and would also like to know what he song was. If anyone could help with suggestions, name of song played and/or band who sung it, or some lyrics to the song to help my search be better, or anything at all. All help will be appreciated."
1,Worst wwe ppv ever?,"MATCH 1: WWE TAG TITLES - Heidenreich/Animal Vs MNM - 4/10Nothing really happed here and only 7 minutes long.MATCH 2: Christian vs Booker T - 5/10Nothing you wont see on smackdown every week.MATCH 3: US TITLE - Booker T Vs Chris Benoit - 6/10Pretty good but a poor ending.MATCH 4: Muhammed Hassan Vs Undertaker - 3/10Pathetic, a lot of the match is just undertaker fighting the sympesisers.MATCh 5: Rey Mysterio Vs Eddie Guerrero - 8/10The first real good match of the evening.MATCh 6: The B.W.O Vs The Mexicools - 3/10What was the point in this match.MATCH 7: BRA AND PANTIES MATCH - Melina Vs Torrie (special guest referee candice) - 2/10Good for eye candy but a crap match.MATCH 8: WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE - Batista Vs JBL - 4/10Boring match which ended in a disqualification.Overall event rating - 3/10."
1,It's gonna suck....,"Great American Bash:Heidenreich and Animal [LOD] vs. MNMAre you kiddin me? If Heidenreich gets a title this ppv is already worthless. No offense to Animal.Chris Benoit vs. Orlando Jordon [US Championship]Benoit wins, it's good, Benoit losses, its gonna suck....Undertaker vs. Muhammad Hassan [#1 Contendership]Hopefully Undertaker will win, the WWE isn't that stupid to make Hassan the #1 contender, right?Torrie Wilson vs. Melina [Bra and Panties Match]Great, another 10 minute waste. Hopefully Melina and Wilson will both lose!Eddie Guerrrero vs. Rey Mysterio [Secret Match]What the F*ck is a Secret Match? No Dq I hope. Is this the end of their rivalry? Hopefully yes.Batista vs. JBL [World Heavyweight Championship Match]Hopefully Batista will hang on one more month and then drop it to the Undertaker at Summerslam. If JBL wins again, here's to his next title reign lasting one month.GAB is easily gonna be the worst ppv of the year, even worse than No Way Out."
1,TNATNA,"This PPV sucked. HEY ALL U WWE LOVERS, ALL OF U CAN KISS MY ASS. TNA IS WAY BETTER THEN WWE. TNA HAS WAY BETTER PPVs. Like IN JULY, NO SURRENDER KICKED ASS. WHAT DID GAB HAVE TO OFFER. A BRA AND PANTIES MATCH. THAT WAS THE ONLY GOOD MATCH.WWE CAN GO F ITSELF. TNA TNA TNA"
1,SMACKDOWNA WAK SHJOW,"HAHAHAHAHAHAA WAK MATHCE A WAK PPV.TORRIE SUCKS, AND MELINAA DOES. BOOKER T IS JEALOUS."
1,Go Outside,The whole TNA rules/sucks thing is really sad. Amazon is for reviews it's not a forum. Please get a life. Go outside and get some friends.
2,"Look precise, but not !","The author has a good and precise approach. However, it seems to me that, as an active member of some organizations relating to the field, the author had opportunities to look at some paper works, he ""cut and paste"" without verifications ?!? I read up to Chapter 4 and found too many errors. I found the matrix in Ed 2.28 was wrong, Eq 2.60 mus have derivative operator in LHS, ..., but the result in Eq 2.41 ~ 2.50 were correct ! Eq.3.16 is correct, but its development is not precise (messy). I failed to prove Eq 4.23 and its consequences are correct !"
4,Could Be Bigger,"I love this stuff, I discovered it on a business trip. I travel a lot, and I can't carry around one of the large jars, so these individual packets are great, but the serving size is a little small for me. Maybe they could be increased by half?"
5,It's the best album of all time...,"no kidding! This has been my favorite album for the past four years and there are no signs that its status as such will ever change. I am no Hole/Nirvana expert, I only know that I can listen to this album over and over and it only grows on me more each time. If you have even the slightest desire to try this album, take the plunge and do it - you won't regret it!!"
3,Curt Kobain's Wife,"Curt Kobain's wife Courtney Love offers a solid offering of mid- 90s grunge. Whilst opening track Violet is aggressive and easily the standout track here, the other songs are clever. Other notable tracks are Miss World and Doll Parts."
4,Hole's best album to date,"This is a really cool record. Obviously, there are some tracks not as good as others (She Walks Over Me is just nasty), but they are more than made up for the sublime nature of Violet (one of my all time favourites), Jennifer's Body, I Think That I Would Die etc., all of which kick serious ass. This is a lot better tha Celeb Skin, although that is still pretty cool. This is a lot less clean, more angst ridden, but it's done well and so avoids sounding tacky. If you like Celeb Skin, I can't really think of any similar tracks here to referance it to - you'll just have to take a chance."
4,Awesome CD!,"I just bought this CD yesterday and am on my 6th listening to it. It's so amazing. However, I marked it down one star because ""She Walks On Me"" sounds almost exactly the same as ""Drain You"" by Nirvana, especially the drums and guitar. I have to admit that I am not a fan of courtney love herself (or Eric), but her voice is really good in this CD, and she does a great job at showing emotion. Kristen Pfaff has a beautiful melodic voice that she uses in the background vocals. Her bass playing is great, and thankfully I can actually hear it in this CD(Kristen is my favorite member). I'm not sure which song it is, but Kurt sings back-up in one song.All in all, amazing CD and really worth getting.Rest in peace Kristen."
3,"oh, courtney",This reminds me of my youth and there for i love it!! Go turn it up and release some anger and throw yourself a pitty party!!!
5,Im hooked,besides the walking dead this is the best series i've ever gotten into. i CANNOT wait to see season 7!
5,Army Strong,Army wives is a very fast paced great program. If you have family or have been in the military you will relate with the changes they go through and the joys.
1,Logitech mm32,"I was hoping for a speaker unit I could use in a bus without a radio. It wasn't what I wanted, but their next generation Logitech mm50 has a rechargable battery, which doesn't need the adaptor plug to plug into the cigarette lighter and to avoid changing AA batteries every day."
2,Not for kids under 10,"No suitable for kids under 10yrs because too many small parts which needs assembly. Too complicated, require time and patience. Each part need to be glued.Seller should inform the buyers the level of difficulty and return policy(By the way, not at all good because more than 40% of the money you paid will be lost for return). I strongly recommend, look for different seller with better return policy."
1,Not my style,I didn't care for the writing style. It is a collection of journal entries or letters so it didn't do a great job of keeping my interest. It didn't teach me anything new...
5,AWESOME LITTLE ITTY BITTY BOOK,"I saw this book at the book store and peeked through it. It had lots of explicit pictures and the content appeared informative, so ght it and I'm really glad I did.The book is fully illustrated and it's small pocket-sized guide features s photographs and information on ways to enrich and diversify one's sex life. It has over 100 color pictues for viewing as you read and learn. This book teaches you everything From the art of seduction, to foreplay, arousal, and an incredible variety of sexual positions, this book combines the spice of ancient eroticism with the candid instruction of a modern sex guide.. Iloved it and my husband loved it more!!!"
2,Not for the average lover.......,Sad to say there was no real info for me here.. If I find a virgin I will give him/her this to read..
1,Only game in town,"O-kay, so you have installed your new closet system and it looks fine. Then three or four years down the road all these little clips get brittle. One night, as you sleep, they all decide to crack and KA-BOOM! The whole system, and everything on it is on the closet floor, wire shelves all bent up and useless.I wish someone would re-invent these clips. The ones ClosetMaid sell are worse than useless after a few years."
3,Of cultural interest,"As a Canadian version of a bloke with a shed, I found this book fun and interesting. On the other hand, it emphasizes the anachronism, and is really more of a cultural commentary than relevant to the DIY crowd. Being Australia, the sheds are mostly metal."
2,horse sense,"While Stevie prepares games for an upcoming gymkana, Lisa develops a constitution for the Saddlel Club, and Carole prepares the stable mare Delilah for her upcoming birth. The girls get so caught up in their own projects that they forget to stick together. It takes the birth of the foal to show the girls they're better off when they pull together."
4,A tender book about family and dying.,"This is one of the first books I remember reading. It is the story of Lew, who is remembering his Grandfather and all the things he loved about him. Without being graphic or overbearing, models grieving for young children and helps them articulate what they'd like to remember about loved ones."
5,"My Grandson Lew ""signed"" edition","I love this book and am pleased to have found a good, clean copy; however, when I saw that it was a signed copy, I assumed the higher price I was paying was not only for the condition but for the signature. I also assumed the signature would be that of the author, Charlote Zolotow, one of my favorites. The only thing I saw resembling a signature was a child's name on the inside front dust jacket, which appeared to have been put there by a child. I have since discarded the dust jacket, because it was much more worn than the book and had served its purpose of keeping the book clean. I'll think twice before buying a ""signed"" copy again."
5,Not the Least Bit Anti-Ukrainian,"This book provides a county-by-county accounting of the OUN-UPA's genocide directed against the Poles in German-occupied Volhynia. But, far from being chauvinistic, this book is scrupulous in avoiding placing the blame on all Ukrainians. To the contrary: much attention is paid to Ukrainians who were murdered for assisting the Poles or merely for advocating good Polish-Ukrainian relations. Furthermore, this book also acknowledges past Polish wrongs against Ukrainians, such as the prewar interference with the Ukrainian Church, although these wrongs have no parallel with the Ukrainian nationalists' genocide directed against innocent Polish civilians. Warning: The abject cruelty and savagery of the Ukrainian nationalists is very graphically described, and reading this book is definitely not for the fainthearted."
1,Incomplete and and absolutely worthless,"I must admit that I sometimes enjoy watching old-school anime with a sort of a grotesque fascination; I am amused by the cheesy plots, the inane dialogue, and 80's-style animation quality. I actually owned this three-part OAV set on an import laserdisc(!). I always thought that the first episode was probably the highest in quality of the three as far as animation is concerned. When the Dangaioh does its transformation, it is quite smooth and fluid. But the second and third installments are pretty much low-end anime even for the 80's. I would've been much happier if this DVD release had only the first episode rather than the second and third; it would make more logical sense anyway! The fact that this putrid company released this DVD WITHOUT the first episode is not only insulting but aggravating.Hopefully, it'll at least fetch me a buck or two on eBay.Anchor Bay, you suck!"
5,Did they come out with Part 2?,This movie was great.My fave was Pai she was bad she is the most aggresive one.This movie was pretty much summed up by the person before me so I'm not gonna say much but they should come out with a sequel even if it is 3 years old.
3,I cried,"I bought this book when it was first published. I was going through infertility and couldn't bear to read it. Thank goodness I didn't! My kids are 13,11 & 9 and I finished it with tears streaming down my face late last night. Such a complicated, sad story. Robby DeBoer is no writer, but her story of her life with Jessi is unforgettable."
5,Best Band since Indigo Girls,"I cannot say enough about this album. Every song is a treat-- I have been listening to the album for well over a year. The music is similar to ballads by Everything But the Girl and Indigo Girls, and even better in some ways. A word of caution, however: the 1996 album is much different, reflecting a harder and faster sound."
3,the moonstone castle mystery... sounds interesting?,I thougt the book was just ok. I found it a little confusing with all of the characters and all the conflicts. I am doing a book report on this book for school and I would have thought It would have been a better and more interesting book. I dont know I would give it 3 stars.
5,Top Notch CD,"I have had this CD by Hank Cramer for a number of months. The selections on this CD are very good. Hanks interpetion of the songs by other writers, makes you feel that they are his own songs. I especially like ""Touch a Name"". Hanks father's name is on the Wall. This adds a special feeling to his rendition of this number. If you have ever been to the ""Wall"", you will no what I mean. He has a way with ""Sea Shanties"" that puts you right on the end of the rope. Listening to his rich voice booming out on this CD, you can't help but tap you foot and sing along."
3,Fun book but same difference,"This is a fun book for anyone who enjoys baking, and it has some nice ideas for cakes that go beyond the directions on the cakemix packet. I wouldn't call it 101 things to do, though, as there are too many recipes that are almost identical to each other, with only a minor difference in ingredients. Also, quite a few of the recipes simply say to bake a cake according to the packet instructions, then use a different flavour of pudding to pour over it, or frosting to decorate it. There are a few good ideas for baking cookies and bars, but again with similarities to each other.On the whole, a nice baking book, but maybe someone could come up with 101 different ideas."
3,Fun stuff,"Bought this for use in our RV. You can do a lot with a box of cake mix. In a RV, you want everything to multitask, even your cupboard ingredients."
2,Poor Upgrade,"I have Create a Card Platinum 5 and really like it. I haven't upgraded for some time because I thought it was good as is. But I decided to buy the Platinum 8 to check it out. What a rip off. Hardly any upgrades at all in the format. A few new graphics, but what was available to me before is now only available on line. I felt taken buying this and think this company should be ashamed of themselves."
2,CreataCard Platinum 8,"I've been using CreataCard for eight years. This is my third updated version. The previous version was Gold 2. I have to agree with the other two who wrote their reviews, in that I was disappointed. What I really missed was the rotating screen saver. Another feature that was changed was the art format, which you could open like a book. I'm fortunate in that I still have the Gold 2. If this is your first version of CreataCard, it's worth the buy. If you have, as I do, Gold 2, save your money. In all fairness, since I didn't pay full price, I have chosen to keep the Platinum 8 version, but I will not buy another update."
5,Ohio maps,This whole series is great if you love to get off the main highways to really see a state. The back roads are well mapped as are sights to see and topographical features.
4,"Funky, Southern fried rock.","This is a great driving CD. SCOTS are one of the oddest band out there, but one of the most fun, too."
4,First Studio Release,"Like it but prefer the almost identical independent release prior to this called ""Too Much Pork For Just One Fork."" Not all songs are identical, but those that are have better versions on the prior album. Fun stuff!"
5,Proud to be White Trash!,"Just like Kate from Kentucky a few reviews down, I too had the supreme good fortune of seeing SCOTS on my birthday...a finer present I could not have dreamed of. Dirt Track Date is the best starting point for SCOTS, but once you get their groove, they can do no wrong (and you'll buy everything like I did). Rick Miller learned a lesson or two from Link Wray, but he's taken those lessons and brought the whole sound to a higher level. Now I may be broke after buying the whole SCOTS catalog, but that's okay...I'll just make my biscuits from spit...and dust. Soooo good."
1,"Nice theory, too bad the sequence analyses of viral samples prove it wrong","Please read the science on this subject before becoming a ""true believer"" in this theory. Detailed study of the sequences of simian immunodeficiency viruses from many species of monkeys and chimps, compared to the sequences of viral samples from humans with HIV-1 or HIV-2 clearly show that Horowitz's theory is not consistent with the data. When in doubt I suggest going with the facts not speculation.When a theory does not match the data - move on.A good start point to enter the scientific literature is a review article ""AIDS as a Zoonosis: Scientific and Public Health Implications"", Hahn BH, Shaw GM, De Cock KM, Sharp PM, published in Science, 28 January 2000, Vol 287:607-614. Just go to the National Library of Medicine website at www.pubmed.gov and enter Hahn BH, Shaw GM, De Cock KM, Sharp PM then click on related articles to access the scientific literature."
1,Disgusted,"My unit stopped heating after a month's use. Called the manufacturer who told me to send it back but that I must use the original box. Unfortunately, I had thrown it away. Offered to sell me a box. I carefully packed it in another box and returned it. The repair shop said the they received it broken and sent a picture of a press in a box with a broken handle. Said they would gladly send it back as is, but I would have to pay shipping. It cost me over a $100 to get it fixed and returned. They either replaced the handle with a used one, or did not replace it at all. Three months later it stopped heating again. This time they told me to open it and replace a thermistor which they sold to me. That component burnt out at least two more times and changing that part became routine. Now the press would not even turn on. I don't believe that I got 20 hours of use out of it. Please do yourself a favor and buy another brand."
1,AGREED. Does not last. Poorly engineered.,It worked great....for about 2 months. The fuse burns out which requires service costing as much as a new machine. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE. ONLY heartache will follow.
1,Not a good buy,"I too enjoyed my press, until it also stopped working. We sent it back and they said it was damaged when it was shipped back and wouldn't fix it. I had them ship it back to me and they shipped me the wrong press! It was much older and was black and silver, not white. I do not recommend this company for presses."
1,Worked for a week,"The press worked for about a week. Then an alarm sounded that would not shut off. I sent the unit back to FEIYUE and after struggling to understand the tech rep that was not proficient in English, he told me they could find nothing wrong with the unit. They sent it back (I had to pay packaging) and when I got it I attempted to use and it didn't heat up at all. So I contacted them again and their position is: we couldn't find anything wrong so too bad. I would avoid this product and the company. Buyer beware!"
3,I hope 07 is better,I thought this game would be great like everyone says it was but superstar gets a bit boring and I'll tell you why. They need a NFL Combine workout and all you do is during a seasonis practice. You do a few movies but why just memorize. Have they heard of headsts?
2,same old same old stuff,yeah this game if fun but its the same thing as last years madden. I would not buy this game cause its the same as 05 if you have that game. So don't play this game if you have 05
3,this a good game but....,its a good game but.....the qb vision which you can take off really sucks. for one it tells you where your gonna pass the ball.and if you dont pass the ball in the light then your not gonna catch it!! NOW QB VISION CAN NOT BE TURNED OFF IN ONLINE PLAY and that really suckssum new thingsqb-vision- 1/5truck stick 3/5 you hit up on the right stick to run someone overchanging coverages at the line- 5/5game modesfran.- still the same old fran. 4/5superstar-fun for the 1st few seasons but it better if you import a player from ncaa06 or street 3.5/5the teamsthe teams in this one are all underrated so i also hate there overallsto be honest the only reason i like this one better is because of nfl superstar other then that 05 is the best
5,5 stars isn't enough,"i probably would have said this is the best album ever if i had reviewed it back in 95 when i got it, but who knows. i feel compelled to tell people who have only heard ""connection"" to buy it. a modern classic with no reservations! surprisingly textured and deep! it has aged very well, other ""classics"": underworld ""dubnobasswithmyheadman"", thethe ""soul mining"", my bloody valentine ""loveless"", and if you have already heard this one and love it, check out Bis ""social dancing"". take my word for it."
4,New Retro,"Good singer, good band, ace inspiration (Wire, largely). More evidence of the 70s connection in the sleeve: check out Ultravox!'s first album to see what I mean."
3,fine but not compelling,I wish the games were a little better. Some of the sound effects are a little annoying - of course they are the little ones favorites.
2,"A few good fights, and that's it","There are a lot of bad fights in this movie, but finally at the end there is one really good fight which is a 3 on 2 match involving Sharon Yeung Pan Pan, Phillip Ko, John Chang and Charlie Chan. And the final fight with Tiger Yang is also good. He is a very good kicker, and though his kicking looks a bit awkward, he is one of the few guys I have ever seen who doesn't favor either of his legs. The story is not too good and its hard to sit through for the first hour, but if you can wait around till the end you will get to see some above average kung fu.2.5/5The Crash DVD is full screen. Picture quality is decent."
4,"English, first language, it is not","The previous reviewer is correct in that this is a huge tomb. However, since my purpose is to learn Blind Signal Decomposition, I will try to read another book first. I want to know one method before learning all possible methods.Be warned -- there are many run-on sentences in this book. The authors like parenthetical expressions, as do I, but I'm not writing a book.I find it difficult to read, because I have to keep trying to figure out what the author meants to say, instead of what they wrote.It might just be me, but when I read about ""dynamicAL systems"" (as in Romeo and Juliet is Romantical), it breaks my concentration. Another problem I find is, ""This is equal WITH that.""Oddly, the version I am reading states was ""reprinted with corrections on April 2003, and Oct 2005"". Yet is still has enough grammatical mistakes and very long sentences, to make reading difficult for me. I am glad I don't have the first printing."
1,this game is NOT GOOD,"i wasn't sure if i wanted to purchase this game or not. i read many reviews about it and they were all generally good. well.. im here to change that. purchasing Grind Session was the biggest mistake i made today....this game is pure garbage and i do not recommend it to anyone..the graphics are bad, the controls are worse, and the game is not fun at all compared to THPS. in short, this game is a bad THPS. Maybe it was the first prototype of Tony Hawk they tried to put out, but it failed miserably on the market?..i don't know... but what i do know is that this game is not worth anyone's money, time or effort to go out and buy. i hope this review is helpful and stops you from making a bad decision."
2,Waste of Money,"Don't waste your money on these ""Goggles"". They have them under the Cyber Goth section of the site and these are far from it. The goggles are HUGE, it looks almost comical and not practical at all and would not work well with ANY Cyber Goth attire, all the antisipation and waiting was for nothing, the biohazard images aren't even symmetrical! They're made out of really cheap plastic and shoddy foam lining and wouldnt last a single night at a club. And again I will warn you, they are HUGE, I'm a pretty big guy and if they look huge on me they will look ridiculous on anyone else. Don't waste your money on these things, try Cryoflesh.com which is a site linked with amazon, sure you might pay a few bucks more but the quality is outstanding."
4,Dumb,"Ok so I'm just being funny when I put that title. This isn't a dumb album. This is a good album. It's the only Nirvana album anyone should buy. I would give this 5 stars but.....some of the best songs on this album aren't even theirs. ""The Man who sold the world"", ""Lake of Fire"", ""Jesus Don't want me for a sunbeam"", and ""Where did you sleep last night?"" are all great songs but they aren't Nirvana songs. If the entire album was all original stuff that was only made by Nirvana and no other band it would be better. But it's more like a compilation of some of Nirvana's favorite songs."
5,Unplugged in New York: Nirvana,"CD is was new condition, and sent promptly. I would recommend purchase through this provider."
5,Their best,"I think this is the best cd ever made.Kurt makes you feel so relaxed and you can tell he's into the music and he's enjoying it.From the beginning with ""About a Girl"" to the spine shivering ""Oh Me"" I ve owned this cd since it came out but I wore it out and just got a new one today.It still sends a shiver down my spine when I listen to it.There was so much passion in all of them.I think this cd is the real definition of Nirvana."
5,Darn godd!,"This is really a good CD. It's pretty obvious that the guys are relaxed, and they are having a good time (I haven't seen the video, but it seems like Curt takes some oppurtunities to make jokes with the audience.) Nirvana plays really well, without any obvious mistakes, even though Curt predicts that he will screw up a couple of times. This is a really versitile CD too, with the almost Beatle's like ""About a Girl"" which Curt says ""most people don't know."" to the Vaseline's ""Jesus Don't want me for a Sunbeam"" to the Meat Puppets, to Leadbelly himself. To put it simply, you need this CD if you like Nirvana, if you like acoustic music, if you don't like acoustic music, or if you like any form of rock and roll."
5,"The Best ""Unplugged set"" ever","Nirvana throws down a guantlet of acoustic songs(not only includiding their singles like other bands) that not only encompases the acoustic setting but great songs in general that captivates the mind and soul. I've personally listened to this cd time and time again since I was about 13, and it's still an emotional landmark as far as music goes.Greatness and diversity defined. *****"
5,It's so beautiful that it hurts...,"I've read one Pearl Jam fan review and I completely disagree with it. I feel sorry about such Pearl Jam fans. I'm one of them so I can't underestimate Kurt Cobain's true talent. This album is a good start for all the people who think that Nirvana is a terrible mistake.It's emocional, piercing and dark. If you know the history behind it, it appears to be even more astonishing. How is an almost dying man able to create such a masterpiece? I listen to it once again... ""I must have died alone... long, long time ago""... He's gone but his music is ""still alive""."
5,Sad yet beautiful,"Though I haven't actually heard it, I can guarantee you that it's good. I watched the show on MTV and can tell you it was one of the best live shows I've ever seen. Unfortunately, Kurt Cobain would commit suicide, making it their last show. Many people wonder what Nirvana would be like today if Kurt didn't commit suicide but I say LEAVE IT BE. Don't go pestering his already-tortured soul. Kut did what he thought was right, even if we saw otherwise. But get the CD before you do anything else Buy it nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnNOW!"
3,extremely over rated,"i know im gonna get sum flaming but i have to say this: nirvana is extremely over rated. this unpluged album is good dotn get me wrong... but it canot compare to alice in chains unplugged. there is absolutely no comparison.the nirvana unplugged is mainly heavier stuff and doesnt have the emotion like AIC. for anyone that has both aic and nirvana unplugged,listen to the first track on nirvana, then listen to the first track on aic unplugged. tell me which one has more emotion and brings you into it more. im sorry but alice in chains is extremely underrated and has much more talenti no this isnt supposed to be a comparison but ask any general rock music lover to listen to both and i guarentee you they will respect aic more. oh and btw layne staley (lead singer of aic) died the same day kurt cobain died but only in 2002. but u didnt know that..."
4,A great introductory for people itching to get a taste of Nirvana.,"How is a more stripped-down incarnation of Nirvana pretentious? Nirvana Unplugged is an excellent album, and a great place to start for new listeners. It's a shame this was the last Nirvana release I loved. Muddy Banks was a total mess, the s/t greatest hits package was a cash-cow, and WTLO doesn't mean much to us fans that have had all the Dale Demos and the first Nirvana gig (Nausbaum Road disk) for years now. The skill of Kurt and his mates shines through here more than it did on anything else Nirvana did (mostly because it's such a clean recording). Nirvana Unplugged is folksy and poignant; the perfect send-off for Kurt."
5,The Best Live Album Ever Recorded In The History Of Music!!,"From start to finish this album is absolutley awesome. It doesn't just have a few cool tunes, every song on the entire album kicks a-s. All Nirvana stuff is great, but this album truly displays the raw talent that Kurt Cobain had. If any of you out there do not have this album, you need to add this to your collection. Even if you do not like traditional Nirvana material you will enjoy the laid back mellowness of Nirvana Unplugged."
5,an essential for any Nirvana fan,"what i really enjoy about this cd is that Kurt Cobain decided to do some covers of a favorite band of his, the Meat Puppets. 3 really good songs of theirs are on here, plus a David Bowie song and a Vaselines song they covered. THey draw from songs that are already fairly mellow, and give them an acoustic edge that sounds awesome. I was already a fan of the Unplugged series, and this is one of the better ones. It is very special, and embodies a lot of music that Nirvana stands for. You definitely need this one in your collection."
2,But Do Not Drop It!!!!!!,"After a year of working well, the relay unit for my Long Ranger III - 110V fell and hit the floor. The shock of the drop caused a heavy transformer inside to shear two legs off at the joint between the transformer body and the lead to the circuit card.As a design observation, the support of the transformer is totally inadequate. Any tool in a shop environment should be able to withstand an applied shock load without sustaining damage. The wire-wrap tie used to support the transformer provides some vertical support, but minimal lateral support. Unfortunately, if the relay init is dropped, the lateral direction is the most likely force application direction. Thus, I am left to try and obtain a replacement transformer or purchase a new unit. Before doing so, I will definately look for alternate products on the market."
4,Works great so far...,I purchased this because I have a dust collector with a short chord in the corner of my work area. It requires a 12 step walk to the collector to turn it on. This is the second one i purchased. The first stopped working on the third use and i returned it thanks to great amazon service. This one has been working well. It is so much more convenient having the remote switch capability.
5,Motorola Expanion Handset,The SD4501 is very functionsl and compact. I like the fact it does not require a telephone jack and the base will take up to 8 extensions.
4,slap on some headphones & set sail on a soundscape!,"I heard this album for the first time while driving down a dark & winding country road. There was a light fog, no moon & I could just make out the shadowy shapes of the leafless trees along side the road as I slipped into the world of Remy Zero.I've had this album for over 5 years & it's still on the top of my rotation. This album pulls you through lyrical idiosyncrasy, & experimental instrumentation, to melodic brilliance.Gold Star Speaker & Twister are favorites of mine.Haunting, hopeful, melancholy, creative & inspired are words that constantly come to mind. Villa Elaine & The Golden Hum build beautifully off of this base, but this is where it began for me."
2,"A, uh... good start....","I mean, they HAD to start somewhere, did they not?I'm not going to say that this disc isn't worth getting. It is. But don't set your expectations whereas thinking this disc's content is as phenomenal as their latter two.As a collector, however, I am a proud owner of this CD."
2,disappointed,"I first was introduced to Remy Zero when watching Smallville on the WB. That initial sound was absolutley awesome. I picked up ""The Golden Hum"" and was really impressed. Every song on that album is full of sound and melody that just isn't heard in a lot of other music nowadays. After enjoying that album so much I thought I'd give another one of theirs a try and bought this one. What a dissapointment. The songs are nowhere near the quality of those on ""the Golden Hum"". I didn't find myself humming along to anything on second or third listenings either. If you want to hear a good Remy Zero album go buy ""The Golden Hum"" or ""Villa Elaine"". This one isn't worth the time or money."
4,Excellent Piece of Work,When I first heard Vincent was releasing his first feature film. I asked when and where. When I first saw it at Vulgarthon I was a pleasant young person. As it was a wonderful piece of film. So I can not wait for his first DVD release. I can not wait to see some of the deleted scenes also.
5,Sweet,"I really liked this book. Once I finished it I just had to pass it around.When Ruth was young, she was attacked by a wolf with green eyes. Luckily her brother was there to protect her. For years she lived with physical and emotional scars. Her fears are heightened when her brother leaves with her cousin to the Crusades. Without her brother to help her father, she takes his place at the family's shop and becomes a woman blacksmith.After nine years, her cousin comes back but alone. She continues life working and also visiting her grandmother in the woods who was exile for being an accuse witch. One day she meets William, an earl, who is shadowed by his families curse. With more and more time William and Ruth fall more and more in love.Although the ending is a little simple, its great.Of all the Once Upon A Time books, this one appealed to me the most and I just LOVED it! I highly recommend it."
2,Good start but....,"Wow, what a potentially great book that crashed and burned about 3/4's of the way through. Perhaps I'm not the right audience but I enjoy retellings of traditional folk/fairy tales. Although I'm tempted to see what else the author wrote because of the great beginning, the ending was abrupt and [hate to say it] poor so I'll probably wait until they show up on a used bookshelf somewhere."
1,not short enough,Short story made long by a dull retelling that i simply could not find interesting.
1,The co-author of this book was funded by the alcohol industry.,"That is correct, the co-author of this book, Stanton Peele, received unrestricted grants from non other that The Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS) and the Wine Institute in 1999 and 2000. How shocking then, that he co-authored a book that condemns abstinence from the product funding his ""research"". There is a reason that this ""work"" is not considered significant, relevant or important by any recognized mental health group.Don't ask a shoe salesman if you need new shoes, and don't disregard the overwhelming majority of mental health workers and doctors, because of a book co-authored by a man funded by the alcohol industry."
2,"Not great, but historical interest","This documentary includes a decent background of the India Gandhi was living in. The historical footage is interesting but repetitive, the key events in his life are simply described in chronological order, the narration is not compelling, the background music wanders between kitsch sitar tunes and inappropriately modern score. Everything about this program looks like they did it on the cheap, but the story is so compelling that you'll probably watch it once if you've seen the Ben Kingsley version. You do get a better picture of how India was part of the British Empire, and how difficult it was for them to break free."
5,Excellent for heat therapy,"I suffer from chronic pain and have used these ""types"" of microwaveable heat packs for years and I must say that this is one of the best I've tried so far. I've only had it for a few weeks now so I can't comment on how it will perform on the long haul, but I can tell you that I heat mine up at least a dozen times/day every day and it works great at helping me with my chronic leg pain. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good heat pack."
3,The BEST FF alternative (of its time),"Legend of Dragoon...truly one of the best rpg's of it's time. The graphics were pretty good and on the ps2 they are supposed to look better. (I just bought a copy so I plan on finding this out) The music was original, and actually very cool to listen to, it makes you feel the story if you will. The characters were all original but a few of them VERY VERY UNNECESSARY!!!! Like Haschel, who is this weirdo anyways? And Maru amongst others...and character development is decent...with a few select characters. The battle system was really awesome, but somewhat complicated, but rewarding. I remember beating the game in like a week. But all in all this game was pretty good. Now to the bad....you run back and forth back and forth. ""yay this place again, how exiting!!"" Some of the characters were just pointless, the bosses were way too easy...and thats just about it"
5,Great game. Should be a sequel.,The innovative gameplay makes this underrated classic truly unique. A great spin on RPG's.
5,My favorite game,Much better than any of the Final Fantasy games. Game play that is fun and draws you in as well as a great story and great characters.
2,The definition of a standard rpg,"The storyline seemed borrowed, the first game that came to mind was legend of legaia. A big problem for me was the battle system ussualy i can stay up late and play videogames, but with this the attacks were insanely hard to do. I ended up missing more than i was hitting. The best part was the videos were crazy cool and probaly why it was so many cd's. It's a long game and if you like it you will love it and if you hate it you won't be able to get through one cd."
5,The BEST game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"i personally spent $... on renting it only, and then bought it! THE BEST GAME!!!!! has ben my fav sience it came out!"
3,"Great graphics, but lacks the gameplay to back it up..","I think the video game websites said it best: Legend of Dragoon is a wonderfully rendered game that lacks heart. The Graphics are 9/10. At best. The main flaw of this game is the terrible translation from the original japanese version. The translators seem to have trouble getting the main point across in plain english. This plus the fact that the writers are trying to be funny makes the story more of a joke (a bad joke) than a serious adventure. Looking for a four disc epic? Either look for Final Fantasy XIII or wait for chrono cross, those games are sure to please."
2,ugh! i shiver at the sound of this game,"I'm just really glad that i played this game at my friends house instead of getting it myself.i have to admit though,i did like this game at the very beggining.i did like the additions before they became an essential part of winning any battle.a lot of people like this game.well,im really into the final fantasy series.this game....its just ugh! On the second disc the plot starts dragging along with a bunch of other mini-plots added to it.i didnt like this game but maybe this is because im a eally haardcore gamer and im used to the final fantasy queality games.i have to say,though,the graphics in this game were incredible.the CG movies are the best ive seen.they actually set competition for the final fantasy VIII movies.anyway,unless you are a newcomer to rpg's,I say skip this one."
5,Best rpg game ever,"my opinion, da best rpg there ever was! great story line and supa dupa fly plot to go wit that! dis legend is totally planned out cuz it did take 3 years to make dis game. totally awesome. everybody should buy dis game right here. tight!!! Im not really an rpg gamer but dis totally made me more interested! I will never forget this game!"
5,Dragoon to the max,"I would have to say overall this game is real good! It has a good plot, sweet characters, cool moves, and the cool part about this is you actually do press buttons while you attack instead of pressing attack and letting it do it by it self, and one more thing you can choose your attacks and they are like special's except you don't have to wait till your special meter fills up. and so in conclusion this isn't like all the other RPG's!!Thank you for taking your time reading this review."
3,"Decent, but no where better than Final Fantasy.","The game is cool...don't get me wrong. But there's times in the story where 1.you just don't understand WHAT they're talking about, and 2. you wanna bang their heads against a brick wall(except for Rose...she's cool). There's nothing you can do to change the outcome...it's as straight as a board. The only thing cool about it is the additions and Dragoon spells. Otherwise, it's a waste."
1,Legend of the Dragoon,I was so disappointed Becau se i love the game and only one of the game dvds worked. my lost
2,BORING!!!!!!,"I thought that this would be an excellent RPG like FF series, but I was horribly wrong. It had an extremely linear storyline, with uninteresting characters and the controls were awful. The graphics were not bad but very few CG scenes. Seriously, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless if you are a true RPG Gamer. I like RPGs but I had to stop playing this game on the second disc. It was still too boring and the story wasn't going anywhere. I gave it two stars for the graphics and that's it."
5,Sony's answer to Final Fantasy,"this game was absoulutly great. I loved it. Ever since I played the demo, I knew this was one for my collection. Now to answer the guy who complained about Shana being a ""Damsel-In-Distress"" I would have to disagree. Need an example? Urobolus, a boss fight against a giant snake. When he moves off the ground, revealing only his upper body, Lavitz & Dart can't reach him, So Shana with the bow is a major help ( besides using items)Now anyway, the addition technique was indeed a unique system and I liked it, I guess some people play something so much that they get used to it. For example if you play Final Fantasy alot, then Legend of Dragoon's batlle system is different.As far as a purchase, it depends on who you are if your a gamer that is looking for a great new RPG, then Buy, if you have to pick ONE RPG game, then rent this and a FF8 and see which you like better."
5,"Very addicting, after a while","I have to admit that I was like many people who compared this game to Final Fantasy. I thought the beginning of the game was kind of boring, but since I paid my money for it I did not stop playing it. After a while I started to get really addicted to it. I learned to love it. No it isn't Final Fantasy, that was established with the name of the game, there aren't very many games that are Final Fantasy. If you like rpg's I think you will like this game, and stick with it if you don't like it at first, it gets much better."
1,Mild......very mild.,"The secenery shots are nice, the clothing is nice, and the girls are pretty.... that's about it. Save your money."
4,Ben Franklin,"I thought Whats the Big Idea Ben Franklin , by Jean Fritz was a preaty well written book. I'll give it four stars out of five. His magnificent contributions to human life wanted me to keep turn the page more and more. I was esspecially impressed with his discoverence of proved electrical theories. If electric was never proved by theory, life today would not be the same. I thought this was a preaty good book and if some one is interested in this book about famous history they shoule definatly go to their local library and check this book out."
4,A thoroughly good read.,"Fast paced and suspenseful, reading this was like watching a very good action-suspense movie. The characters were interesting and very human, the relationships realistic, and the technology fascinating. Reading this was a thoroughly good time."
2,Technoboring,"A dull, low paced story even though there were some very good situations to exploit in order to entertain and make an excellent read. Many times I wanted to put it down. The author was unable to turn the mistery into something suspenseful, and gripping and the ending follows the easy way. An average book easy to forget"
4,The men who rocked the world.,"This album was a success in many ways, but one of them is that I think it was like hearing your favorite band for the very first time again, and at this point, ""Nirvana"" was alot of people's favorite band. It also showed people that the band could do more than just rock, and highlighted the musical and songwriting skills of the group. This disc is also about 1/3 covers, while still including all the ""Nirvana"" songs that should have been. Every track here is good, but my faves would have to be Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold The World"", the Meat Puppets ""Lake Of Fire"", and their own ""Something In The Way"". While their other live disc ""From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishka"" may be a better representation of the band, this one is more essential."
4,Not for unfit over-40s,"I bought the Tae-Bo Gold tape for my 39th birthday. It says it's for the over-40s but I think I'm close enough.I am quite fit running 3 or 4 times per week and I was a little sceptical when I saw that the running time on the video was only 35 minutes. After I did the tape I still felt that it was not challenging enough since I had no trouble getting through it the first time. However, I really felt my back and my hips the next day - always the sign of a good workout.I do think that an unfit older person would have trouble with the video as there are a lot of combination kicking and punching moves. As my husband put it - if my 62 year old mother tried this, she'd fall over.Also it is difficult to hear Billy Blanks at times because the music is very loud. As for Billy himself, he is terrific - very friendly, enthusiastic and motivating without making you feel like you are a failure if you can't do it all."
1,ONLINE IMAGES DON'T WORK,I HAVE OWNED MANY AMERICAN GREETINGS PROGRAMS IN THE PAST AND THIS ONE IS THE WORST!!...THE ONLINE IMAGES DON'T WORK FOR SOME REASON...EVERYTIME I TRY TO LOOK AT THEM THE PROGRAM SHUTS OFF ...I CAN'T EVEN DESIGN MY OWN CARD! I HAVE TO MAKE THE PRE-MADE ONES ONLY.....NO WONDER ALL THE AMERICAN GREETINGS PROGRAMS ARE DISCONTINUED AND NO LONGER HAVE ANY CUSTOMER SUPPORT AVAILABLE.....BUY HALLMARK CARD STUDIO 2004 OR PRINTMASTER PLATINUM 16.0........
3,Sun at midnight,I loved sun at midnight. It was one of the most interesting stories that I have read for a long while. It kept me totally captured and waiting for the following chapters. Love the way Rosie Thomas researches so much before writing and it shows.
1,Why send out a faulty product?,"Make no mistake: There are some great pictures in this calendar. But a calendar is first and foremost for measuring time, and at this it is a failure. There are 3 Junes, 2 Febs, and many months missing! How can they even send this out? We did not realize it until too late, so we can't return it now. Try again next year, MCNY!"
3,Jungle Madness...,"This wacky, seemingly endless movie (the entire original is 3+ hours long) is a series of chases through tunnels and jungles, w/ dozens of fights tossed in! We've got the sinister Zolok, who is creating an army of giant zombies in his mountain lair! How? By using his brain-destroying machine and his enlarger of course! There's Bruce Gordon, electrical engineer and adventurer, out to stop Zolok's evil plot! We also get Queen Rhama (who is actually pretty hot), seductress and slave-trader, who wants an army of giants of her own! Then there's Butterfield, who is seeking his own fortune, at everyone elses expense! There's even an arabian sultan and his army! Not to mention the tribe of white african natives, turned white by Dr. Manuse, a scientist w/ a freeze-gun and a beautiful daughter! Whew! I didn't even mention the muscle-man or the hunchback! LC is a lot of fun in places, but tends to drag on... and on! Queen Rhama really is a hottie though!..."
1,"Wow, wish I saw before I bought","Terrible, terrible, terrible. Good luck placing a photo of your own into this thing. And once you do go look at the print preview - what happened. Total crap."
1,Broderbund Ignores Customers,The Calendar Creator product is useless for all but the very lucky. The software appears to be impossible to install without customer support and there IS NO customer support. It has proven to be impossible getting any help at all from Broderbund either on-line or by phone. We have been trying for two months and have spent almost as much in long distance charges (all of it on hold) as we spent on the product. Steer Clear!
1,"Hate it, Hate it, HATE IT!!!","This is by far the worst calendar program EVER! I absolutely abhor it. It is not at all user friendly. It randomly prints boxes where you didn't create them. The functionality to move calendar entries from one month to another doesn't exist...you have delete the entry and completely recreate. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with it because my boss likes the way it looks...too bad he doesn't have to struggle with it!"
2,I didn't like Snow Angels very much.,"Reading Snow Angels I felt like grabbing on an old and insipid piece of chewing gum that sticks to the underside of a desk, asking myself what might have been its former taste! Following the hint of a friend I expected to find an interesting mixture of drama and thriller. But what I discovered was a boring and amateurish piece of wanna-be-literature. Call it intuition or ignorance - this book didn't touch me at all. I just don't see the point of it. No thrill - no romance. Not even a shocking mirror of reality or at least a teasing story to fall for/identify with. Too f****** bad!"
3,CMS Data Transfer Kit for Notebook Hard Drive Replacement,"My mission was to replace the 6gb Fugitsu hard drive in my Dell Inspiron 5000 notebook w/XP, with a new 40gb Toshiba. The kit, software and instructions for cloning the old drive appear to be excellent and the data transferred even using USB 1.1. However, I was unable to boot from the new drive when installed. An error message ""remove discs or other media"" appeared immediately.Customer support at CMS responded immediately and followed through for several days with different software, but finally we had to give up. On the last try, the original drive would no longer boot. CMS offered to refund my purchase.The solution: I installed XP on the new drive from the CD and was happy to see all the data had transferred. The basic problem remains unresolved."
2,Don't expect quality,I got this gadget only because i was getting a cheap price for a refurbished product. It's positive aspects lie in the fact that we can transfer the recorded stuff into computer; its light weight can also be considered a positive aspect. Negative aspects revolve around the quality of recording. Even with directional feature there is no improvement.It's a good gadget if you are new to recording and are using it to get acquainted with a hope to move on to more sophisticated ones later.
5,Convenient & Reliable,I've used this switch on my dust collector for several years now. I can't imagine having a dust collector without a remote starter switch. I've never had a problem with it. Highly recommend it.
3,Graphics....,This is a truely great game for GBA and Snes....however it is a near exact replica to the Snes version sound and all. My main problems w/ the game are the graphics...it looks like a child drew this. Donkey Kong is so hard with his jump moves too....
2,very dificult to operate,I would not recommend this scale. it's too complicated and the buttons are not comfortable!
2,TOO BORING,"DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK,AND IT WAS A LOT TO UNDERSTAND.I AND IT WAS BORING . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT."
2,Astonishing?,You know a great story can be ruined by awful animation. It looks like it was done by the same guys who did Jacob two-two & The Mr.Men Show. Its so wooden & tilted much like Milton The Monster. I think the viewers will be too busy looking at the third-rate animation to listen to the story. I give this dvd a 3.4 out of 10.
2,FALSE ADVERTISING,"First off. This is false advertising. No where in the product description does it tell you that it is a motion comic. I decided to purchase this thinking it was an animated film such as Superman/Batman: Public Enemies or another animated film. Yes it is animation but it is a motion comic. I was upset. You should display that some where. Second you don't need to purchase this, if you have xbox live you can get it from off of the zune media section, netflixs, and off of the ps3. I ordered 3 movies X-Men: Gifted, Family Guy: Partial Terms of Enderment, and Superman/Batman: Apocalypse and out of all 3 only the Superman/Batman film held my attention."
1,Pretentious and Convoluted.,"Joss Whedon's stab at an X-men series leaves a bitter taste of urine in my mouth, and I can't get it out. He's taken all of your favorite characters and stripped them of anything likable and put them into a cartoon that I could have undoubtedly animated better when I was 3.Here are the big surprises:- Scott (Cyclops) is a crying emo bitch.- Logan (Wolverine) is just angry. For no apparent reason this time. I mean, worse so than normal.- Kitty (Shadowcat) seems like she's a 13 year old girl who woke up 30 one day.- Emma Frost isn't poorly done.- Beast... well, let's put it this way, Joss Whedon sucks.There are better X-men TV series out there. X-men Evolution was amazing. That series was proof that you can take artistic liberties with a franchise and build something great out of it. This series made me want to poke my eyeballs out with a rusty fork.Save yourself the $10. And if you have the $10 to spare, use the 80 minutes of your life for something better than this."
4,Great Product,"Ok, I got this mouse way back in October of 2000. I don't know how I could live without it. It is sturdy, contrary to many people's belief that dropping it will hurt the optical sensor--I've dropped it many times and it works just the same. The only thing I don't like about the mouse is sometimes the cursor on the screen will suddenly go to the upper-right of the screen. I'm an avid gamer, and this can get annoying when your in the middle of a fight. But the mouse is so smooth I don't have the guts to go buy a different mouse. Highly recommended to a gamer or someone who uses a mouse all day."
4,Excellent mouse,"This mouse is an excellent replacement for the standard mouse that has the little ball in the bottom, especially if you are tired of cleaning out the gunk in the bottom that can make the tracking sticky. This mouse also looks very cool... there is a neat light that glows out the bottom when your computer's on and it also has a little tail light. The precision and fast response time of the mouse is amazing...a vast improvement over traditional mouses (mice?). The two extra buttons on the side also come in very handy.. they are precongifured to be used as back and forward buttons for internet browsing, a very useful feature, but you can change them to do a lot of other things. The only problem that I've had is that it is sometimes diffucult to avoid pressing the ""forward"" button by accident but it's not a big thing. Highly recomended!"
1,"So much potential, so little delivery..","I've had MS mouses for the longest time.. and they were solid, no frills mice.. but with the new optical series, MS needs to work on some probs.. don't get me wrong, tho.. when I bought this mouse, I got it home, installed it and loved it.. it fits the hands pretty well, the extra buttons make sense and it worked well..... for two days.. then it promptly died.. no cursor movement on screen, no red led lighting up, nada.. after reinstalling it and trying it on my other usb port, it remained hopelessly dead.. this is the 2nd MS optical I've had and they have very short life spans.. they work well when they work.. they just don't work very long... til MS gets their act together, consider me a Logitech convert..."
5,The perfect mouse,"The IntelliMouse Optical is the perfect mouse. It never misses, and it works flawlessly on most surfaces.I have the IntelliMouse Optical and the IntelliMouse Explorer, and I actually prefer this one, the Optical. It has most of the features of the Explorer, but it is also a bit more compatible than the Explorer. You can use this mouse with non-Microsoft operating systems, such as Linux, BeOS, etc.I use automatic switchboxes from Cybex and Linksys, and I had problems with the Explorer not switching properly. The Intellimouse Optical does not exhibit the same incompatibilities with some switchboxes (check with your switchbox manufacturer to make sure).In addition to the usual left and right mouse-buttons, the Intellimouse Optical also includes two additional buttons, one on each side of the mouse. These buttons by default are mapped to move forward and back within your web browser, but you can remap them to provide other application functionality."
3,"Nice, Funny, but Values not for Kids","I dont believe its the type of DVD that should be around for young kids. Sexual ideas for the same sex is quite apparent with Saki's character.As a Christian in America, we have to remind each other of the things we watch. I quite agree that this material is funny and it helps my Japanese, yet the values is not good. Truly not for kids."
5,"I love it, but the pup's not so sure...","I bought the XS size for our 7 pound chihuahua-minpin mix. Given that there's not a lot of room to fit in the extra specail features like mesh over the tummy, this PFD does everything very well. The clip across the chest is far better than the double-thickness velcro style, the orange color and reflective tape are highly visible when she tries to hide under the sofa, and the handle on the back is easy to grab and still low-profile enough to not create a hazard for her to catch on things. Excellent value!"
2,Cute but not enough material for a whole book.,"This sort of stuff should be posted on a website rather than being published in a book. It's fun, and the book format probably serves to help fund good causes (anything anti-Bush). Nonetheless, I'd expect something less flippant from a scholastic heavyweight like vanden Heuvel."
2,Preaching to the Choir,"This is a book of self congratulatory leftie quotes and ideas that does not add up to the sum of its parts. Preening, over earnest, boring. I like Ms vanden Heuvel when she is on TV duking it out with say, George Will - but this is not a book that is contributing in any way to the current political debate. Snide, glib, preaching to the choir."
2,The one SY album to avoid,"This album was the last of their trilogy of potential mainstream albums. While ""Goo"" is a poppier version of ""Daydream Nation"" and ""Dirty"" is a successful ""grunge"" record, ""Experimental Jet Set"" drops them to the level of a by-the-numbers alternative band. They didn't even support this album with a live tour. The only memorable songs on the album are the hit ""Bull on the Heather"" and the closer ""Sweet Shine."" The acoustic opener is not all it's purported to be, and ""Starfield Road"" is over before it even begins. After this album, they drastically overhauled their sound, and released the masterful and underrated ""Washing Machine."" ""Experimental Jet Set"" shows Sonic Youth at the least adventurous stage of their career."
1,won't work,"I bought 3 additional remotes for and followed the directions for syncing them but could not get them to work, while the original remote worked right out of the box"
2,Read this before buying,"I had a trial pack of 6 of similar detox pads. Every morning that I used these, I woke up and threw away the smelly, icky pad. Seemed like it did something. So I bought this 100 pack.After using them for a few days, I read up on wikipedia about all the scientific tests, etc that were done and it was verified that these do not work. So I asked myself, than why do they change colors and stink when I used them? As a test, I put a slightly wet paper towel on one over night. The next day it was smelly and icky like it was on my foot.Bottom line is these are a hoax..they're snake oil. Your feet is not the type of membrane that can support a detox. That icky pad in the morning is from moisture, not toxins.Save yourself the trouble, buy some pills, change your diet, and accept the fact that you can't throw money at a problem and just work out a little bit each day."
4,Decent Desktop Reference for the Student / Professional,"Strunk's work is a solid baseline for grammar, punctuation, and composition. If your workplace tends to create its own standards for linguistics, it might be valuable to keep this readily available.It is somewhat limited in terms of all the possible usages of punctuation, and admits as much in its first pages. While this is a valuable reference for most scenarios, it can't stand alone."
5,The Writer's Bible,"I first read about The Elements of Style in Stephen King's On Writing (which I highly recommend). King recommended The Elements of Style as the last word on the rules of writing. He was correct.The book is short, concise, and answers any writing issue you may have. I noticed a significant improvement in my writing after using it as a reference manual.Whether you are a writer, editor, student, or blogger keep it next to you while you're writing!-Jenn Astle"
5,Unbelievable,I do not know why I wasn't ever told about this book! My professors never mentioned it in college. Writing partners never said a word. Editors I have worked with failed to give a hint. I am disappointed with all of them.This book is a must have for anyone who is serious about communicating with the written word. It makes every other book on writing worthless and overwritten. Every word in this masterpiece makes perfect sense. I do not know how I managed to write one meaningful sentence without The Elements Of Style. Don't be a hack. Get this book!
2,Elements of Style,"The book arrived in good condition, but it didn't have as much information as I had anticipated."
4,Great for starters and bedroom DJs,"Given the low price and loaded features, the Axis 9 has probably the highest value of any cd turntable currently on the market. It has solid performance with plenty of gadgets to keep you occupied. One problem which makes this turntable not suitable for professional use is the slight stutter when the key lock is in place. The problem is only slight and intermittent, but will drive you completely crazy if you are a perfectionist. Otherwise, for beginners and bedroom DJs this is the best cd turntable out there."
5,"Good product, but should have been standard equipment","Worth the money, but it really should have been part of the N64 package."
5,Another great Honor,I really like these world of Honor stories. I never realised some of the side stories could exist. I just hope they keep writing!
4,He writes like he talks,"This book is like talking to an old frien. You find yourself drawn in by the stories he has to tell, and always come back for more. The relaxed sytle makes for a good read."
4,Great game!,"We bought this game for our 10 year old who is a huge dragon fan. The first time my husband and son played it they were a bit confused at the start, but after it got going, they loved it. Our son loves it, and it is perfect for his age range. He loves the figures, and the set up and it keeps his attention from start to finish! We highly recommend this for any serious dragon fan!"
4,Five stars for the 3rd and 3 stars for the 9th,"Symphony 3 was recorded live at Santa Cecilia, Rome. Symphony 9, on the other hand, was recorded live at Philharmonie, Berlin. Symphony 9 is the same recording as the disappointing one available with Piano Concerto No 2. Buy that DVD (Symphony 9 and Piano Concerto 2) for the Piano Concerto. Buy this DVD for Symphony 3. By the way, these 2 performances come in 2 DVDs but the labels are mixed up--the one that says the 3rd contains the 9th, and vice versa."
1,Trash,"This album is almost as bad as D4L's album Down 4 Life and is worse than Dem Franchize Boyz On Top of Our Game. Yes you heard me correctly, it is even worse then On Top of our Game which is almost a miraculous feat. In other words, don't buy this trash. The odd chance you do like it I also suggest Kevin Federline's new album Playing With Fire."
1,"The only thing ""Going Down"" is Yung Joc's career","It's hard to belive that the same record company who brough us the legendary Notorious BIG and spectacular albums by Boyz N Da Hood and Black Rob is now giving us this talentless junk. Yung Joc is an awful rapper and this album is proof. Bad lyrics, weak beats, and annoying skits are basically what sums this album up. Not only is this the worst album so far this summer but it's also going to be headed to my list of the worst albums of the year. This is absolutely dreadful. Big Thumbs down."
5,Great Debut!,"This is a great debut from another rapper out of Georgia that goes by the name of Yung Joc this album has a lil something for everyone it has up tempos, mid tempos & even a song 4 the ladies called 1st time Ft. Marques Houston overall this cd is a must have so if you don't have it you need to get it."
1,"Way to go, joc.","Good ol' Texas style materialistic hip-hop. You have a lot to learn from Mr. Joc kids, follow his footsteps and just before you know it when mama and/or papa can't support you anymore you'll find the nearest supermarket available to you for employment. Gangsta fo life, try not to get killed in the ghetto in the mean while."
4,I liked it,"I dont know why everyone hates this album, I liked it. His lyrics are mediocore but the beats and the production made up for it. My top 5 tracks are:Dope boy magicPicture PerfectIt's Goin DownDo ya BadHear me comingIts a good album if you just give it a chance."
1,How did this Cd make it to the top ten?,"The song `It's going down' was an ear catching tune. Other than that the album is horrible. I was very irritated after the fourth or fifth song. I agree with a previous comment that P. Diddy (Puffy, Sean Combs or whatever he's calling himself these days) is getting yet another quick buck. He did it for Loom, Black Rob, G. Dep, and the list goes on and on. Yung Joc does not represent the south at all; maybe his neighborhood in College Park, but defiantly not the south in a whole. Don't waste your time and effort purchasing this CD, just borrow it from your little sister or brother."
4,It's okay................,"He sounds like Young Jeezy a little....I only liked 2 songs, I know you see it and Goin down. Even know goin down has a bit of an irritating beat, and that person who made up a really funny version of I know you see it....lol....I would just buy the singles."
3,Joc,Yung Joc is alright. I didn't like his song when it first came out but its straight I guess. I mean I wouldn't buy the CD cuz I'm not into his style but he aight...
3,"Another useful Twist & Shout product, I think.","In the past, I have reviewed the Twist & Shout Addition and others giving them all excellent reviews. Twist & Shout Multiplication should receive the same review, I think. My children were a bit slow learning their multiplication facts. They knew them, but the answers came slowly. Twist & Shout Addition had worked wonders with these kids, so I expected the same enthusiasm. Well, perhaps because they are older, they didn't maintain their enthusiasm for this product. The same voice, the same rhythmic tune, the same encouraging words -- just didn't hold their attention beyond the first few encounters. (Funny, they still like the T&S Addition.)"
4,Super product,"I bought this for my son who was having a lot of trouble remembering his multiplication facts. He is typically a good student. When he was in fifth grade he was getting poor marks in math due to not knowing his facts. We tried flash cards, games, nothing helped. When he first got this he would want to play with it on his own, which was great. After he got bored with it I would encourage him use it, which he did. After just a few months he learned his facts by heart! What a painless and fun way to learn something so dull, yet vital. I think this is a great learning toy."
5,I enjoyed this book,"I bought this book (an autographed copy)at a book signing and I couldn't put it down. I read the book in one sitting! Angela Weathered deals with issues that are, although tuff to face sometimes, real. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to your next book"
3,N64 Official Rumble Pak by Sanjay Schrapel,"Well, the Official N64 Rumble Pak is just not the best out there, to put this review in one sentence. This pak provides excellent vibration, but you need to change the batteries often. AAA batteries cost twice as much as their AA counterparts, and recharging batteries take about 11 hours per charge. My friend and I were joking the other day about having to change the batteries every time you got shot in Perfect Dark, then I showed him the Naki Rocker Pak. This pak dosen't require any batteries (gets power from console, like PSone) and the base model comes with a 256k memory card built in (there is a 1mb version as well). The Naki version is WAAAAY cheaper than this Nintendo version, and is more practical. I can't really reccommend the Official Rumble Pak. Even if you can't find the Naki version ... there are loads of cheaper 3rd party paks on the market, even here on Amazon.com."
4,Cute relationship,"Only 75 mins long, this little indie covers a lot of ground by cutting and time shifting throughout. We see the couple at various stages of their relationship, all jumbled up at once throughout. Interesting gimmick and it doesn't detract. No plot. Just the arc of a relationship, and a not especially real one, at that. Still, this holds your attention for its short duration."
2,Nice production,"This CD is pop. Bubblegum.This CD is not ground breaking in any artistic way whatso ever. The sample style is nice to listen to, but was totally played out years before this came out.At least Beck does not rap on this cd.The beck i really enjoy is the beck who makes up goofy songs based on obscure folk masters such as woody guthrie.i think becks version of electronica and rapping are really wrong and embaressing. the same problem i have with dub narcotic sound system. If he wants to be taken seriously in those feilds he needs to put much more effort in to it.his pop melodies are quite nice. however i could just buy a motown record, and get something truly emotional and truly amazing.at least beck is not doing grunge.i wish he would stick to roots. i think he's looking in the wrong direction."
2,The lyrics are downers,"Beck's music is OK (though it is too self-consciously trying to be strange), but his lyrics are the pits. Of course, the lyrics are very abstract and many times seem to make no sense at all. That alone wouldn't bother me, but the words that Beck seems to randomly string together finally end up ""coagulating"" into a picture of depression, death, decay, social decadence, and so on. There are many references to death, garbage, rot, nooses, and other wonderful topics. Beck's state of mind seems to be terribly bleak (or maybe it's all just a con, an act. Either way, I don't like it).This guy is the new Dylan? That's an insult to Bob."
5,A monstrous creation that is one of the best CDs in years,"Odelay is one of my favorite CDs and one of the best I've heard in years. Every song on it is great. There's a ton of sound here. And another thing: it's actually enjoyable to listen to. A lot of recent music is repetitive and depressing, but Beck is definitely not.Trying to put Beck's music into a category is futile. Beck combines elements of rock, folk, hip-hop, blues, techno, punk . . . the list goes on and on. Odelay is an album no one should be without."
3,I wish I could say I loved it but...,"I wish I could say I loved this album, because I think Beck is so damn cool, but after the first few songs his artistic license make me crazy and paranoid. I had this album at work and had to take it home, for fear of damage to my career as a result of Beck-inspired irrational behavior."
3,overrated,"I agree with what others said, ODELAY seems to be trying too hard. It has some good songs but they would be better without the weird background noise and such. And some songs just aren't that good at all. Critics who rated this as one of the best albums of the 90s need to get out more."
3,Is it really better?,"Other reviewers mention that this is brand better than the other brands you can buy at Home Depot etc., but I'm writing to point out: this is just plastic sheeting & tape.Because, I'm not so sure this is really any better than any other sheet-o-plastic on the window. Sure, my living in Southern California means I probably don't need this as much as most other buyers, however much of the architecture here isn't super-concerned with insulation so when temperatures drop to the low 40s and the heater in the living room isn't keeping-up, I looked for a solution from my snow-living days. So, maybe this helped, a bit, but when you open the red box from 3M don't be surprised to simply see a sheet of super-folded plastic and a roll of double-sided tape.That said, I hope it keeps out your window drafts."
3,Surprise Twist Ending,"An archly amusing presentation of several possible theories of the solution to Dickens' unfinished ""Mystery of Edwin Drood"". Here you can read the unfinished novel, interspersed with a discussion of the story by numerous fictional detectives. As a previous reviewer stated, no definitive conclusions are reached. There is, however, a surprise ending as the assembled fictional detectives reach a consensus about Dickens' real life death.I personally have a totally different take on the conclusion of the fictional story."
4,Great Book!!,This is totally worth reading it is so awesome. It tells of a woman who finally stood up when her rights were violated in a time when it was a man's world and women had no voice.
3,Good Read,"A Doll's House brings up many timeless issues. Ibsen is a wonderful writer. However, Nora and Torvald are very annoying characters."
3,"Nothing earthshaking, but still good","This play didn't quite blow my mind with its talent, but it's interesting and has loads of symbolism. Better the second time through than the first. If you can get past the seeming inanity and selfishness of many of the characters (especially Torvald...sometimes i just wanted to smack him, and often Nora wasn't much better)i think Ibsen has some pretty good things to say. Nothing that hasn't been said before, though."
3,I didn't like Nora's attitude...,"I've just read the book A DOOL'S HOUSE and I liked it. Good dialogues, good plot, but I didn't like the way Ibsen introduced some characters such as Ms Linde, for example. She just entered to the scene to be the one who knew the ""bad guy""(If you can say so about the man who lent the money to Nora). What is more, I didn't like Nora's attitude when she leaves her children and husband. She should have changed her behaviour with him long before and not all of a sudden turning into a ""free woman"" who doesn't accept her husband's behaviour. Whatever happens, I think a mother should never leave her kids, specially with a man who was never really a father to them."
2,not my type,"isn't quite my type of story. i think the last act comes too quickly and nora's character isn't developed enough earlier in the play to warrant such a transformation. good idea, great at the time, i'm sure, but not as engaging now."
5,Great Album!,It is really a shame the orginal memebers of this group parted ways. They sure made some rockin' music.
2,I bought into the hype,"Seether was a good song by an otherwise marginally talented band. The comparison to Hole is somewhat amusing from other reviewers as that band is a prime example of what a hack Courtney Love is. Ergo any band that emulates that one, is just a bad copy of a bad copy.Go buy Elastica's self titled debut if you want a great cd from the 1990's."
3,I don't get it,"The popularity of this album puzzles me. It just doesn't move me the way I FEEL ALRIGHT and EL CORAZON did. Those were scrappier, more passionate, and sounded more like... well... Steve Earle. TRANSCENDENTAL BLUES verges into Tom Petty territory just a bit too often, and that's no knock against Tom, but do we really need another one? That said, Earle still tops most of the dreck that's out there. But if you're an old fan, I'd sample this one before purchasing."
4,Wanted to hear Galway Girl,I purchased this cd solely for the purpose of hearing Galway Girl! Love that song and so cd didn't disappoint
3,A better Steve is out there,"This may be his weakest album and it is still better than 99% of what else is out there. His vocals sound often strained and the production sounds over-managed. If you are looking for a first Steve Earle album to own, try another one, they won't disappoint. If you are a fan, buy it. You will be incomplete without it."
4,agree 41/2-shorter version,"This is quite simply his best yet(imho)His origanal interprtation of bluegrass is immediately accessable to 'grassers and those new to the genre. What really strikes me his homage/interpretaion of the Beatles. The first cuts are blatant reinventions of the Beatles circa rubber soul/revolver and its delightful. But Steve really nails it on ""when I fall""and ""i don't want to loose you yet""-my personal favorites. Steve continues to grow and astound!"
2,Only for the hardcore star wars fan,"The scenery and the music are great, but if you're not a diehard star wars fan, pass on this one...It's just too damn difficult. I'm going to have to get a Game Shark to get anywhere with this one. The graphics are a bit fuzzy at times also, and sometimes your character will inexplicably get stuck in the middle of the scene and die from assaults by enemies. I love Star Wars, but I think LucasArts (?) dropped the ball with this one."
2,Upset,"The fighting is fun, but the controls couldn't possibly be any harder. I've never played an impossible game to beat. The controls on this game make it impossible, though. Moreover, the graphics and music are dull and substandard. Save your money."
5,This game kicks butt!,"You have got to play this game.It has to be the best game onplaystation now.If you liked the movie you'll love this game.Thegraphics are incredible and the game play is easy to catch on to.There are a ton of moves you can do like you can run towards the battle droids and stab them with your lightsaber.You can also spin around and cut them and deflect there laser blasts back at them.So all you Star Wars fans out there,and even if you don't really like Star Wars,you have got to try this game...."
2,Worse than Phantom Menace,"You would think that a game based on jedi light saber fighting would be a guaranteed hit, but Lucas Arts missed their mark again. The fighting is similar to the first Phantom Menace game, but enough already with the jumps. Hello video game developers- you do not need jumping in a 3D game, this isn't Mario Bros. It's disappointing when you work your way through a level only to be stopped at the end trying to jump from one ledge to the next. Also the game play is lacking. I've only had the game a short time and I've had screen freezes a few times. I encountered the same problem in Phantom Menace. If you're a Star Wars fan, I guess you have to get it, but if you're choosing between the 2 titles, I would recommend Phantom Menace over Power Battles"
1,IM a sleep,very boreing. it turned out when i have to potect anikin i hit him with my light saber when he ran away. be obi one and dont stop pessing sgaue and you will bet darth marle
5,Dogmatic but fun - and useful,"Of the hundreds of 'How To' books on movie making - or mostly screenwriting - this slim volume is succinct, provocative, dogmatic (as only Mamet is dogmatic), witty and more use than twenty texts on 'the rules'. It contains no doubt edited lectures to Colombia students - and sometime the students' too hasty responses. Although it's called 'On Directing Film', it is possibly of more use to writers in terms of what is necessary in a piece of screen storytelling and what is redundant dead wood. Mamet's ideas on 'backstory' and exposition - unnecessary - for instance, are radical, but his funny examples of how 'explaining' kills narrative drive are worth considering. Some may object that if one were to follow Mamet's principles, one would end up with a Mamet movie - that is, something less than a box office smash. But that is not the point. The point is to cause one to question one's own work and that can't be a bad thing."
4,"A good book, and would be great for use in the classroom","This is a really interesting book about a group of kids who *think* they are training to be colonists on a new planet with their families -- only to discover when they get there that their families aren't coming, and they've more or less been handed off to something that's half slave labor, half reform school for the unwanted. The kids struggle to get along with each other, to protect their siblings and friends in the group, and in the end, to defeat the evil plans of the people running the program.This book is not only an interesting, fun read, it is also thought-provoking in a lot of ways that would be great for use in a 5th-7th grade classroom. The book touches on issues related to bullying, disabilities, protecting the environment, what ""alien"" means, communicating and relationships with people who are very different from you, etc."
5,Great Thinking/Driving/Chilling Music,"Interstate is my all time favorite driving music CD (cleverly named, eh?). Although I am a fan of many of the guitar heroes (satriani, beck, etc) this album has no pyrotechnics at all, just solid, well played melodies and grooves. Sometimes some interesting ""art of noise"" stuff thrown in for good measure, but always in good measure.Definitely recommended - unfortunately none of the other CDs in the Pell Mell catalog have the same feel as this CD. I bought ""Star City"" and ""Flow"""
5,AWSOME!,Great roller derby documentry! I'm trying out this year for a local league and watching everything possible! All the other potential fresh meat told me about this and I LOOOOOVED it!!!
5,The funny de Funes,Louis de funes is a french actor who is really funny to see but also to listen to. This C.D. has to be heard by everyone who understand french.Good listening. Antonio
1,worst machine I've ever owned,"I've had an X61 since September. In that time my machine has had 2 system crashes, resulting in it spending the majority of the time either at the repair facility, in transit, or in the tedious process of reloading all of my files and software. The technical support people won't tell me what the problem is, so I can only assume it will happen again when it comes back. Aside from that, it has been never been stable. It has been a complete waste of money and waste of time."
4,Cereus Blooms at Night by Shani Mootoo,"If you are a High School student read this book carefully because when it comes time to write that essay good luck on finding one concrete line of thought to follow. There is so much going on in this book, Mala and her many problems, the book jumps around a lot, I reread the first half of the book and got a better understanding of the story by doing so. This book is deep and passionate with lots of groundbreaking ideas. Take your time reading this book 'cause if you just rush through it your gonna miss the main ideas. Ciao!"
5,Love songs you can treasure always.,Engelbert Humperdinks songs seem to continue to please no matter what your age. These songs are really beautiful and its so refreshing to be able to understand the words and the melodies are so pretty.
3,All the Hits Minus the Music!,"SD at their best are transcendent and this set includes almost all of their music for close to a decade. So why the three stars? As noted by ""pacara"" below, the CD production here is archaic and the sonic impact much less smashing than the original media. These disks left me yearning for the Remastered originals. It's not worth the savings to go with this ersatz SD. You might wind up paying up a second time, like me, just to hear Steely Dan with the music put back in it."
5,From the Back Cover,"When Britt Met Ashley. Britt Carlton wasn't looking to fall inlove, he'd been there, done that, and didn't want to do it again! Then Ashley Thornton moved in to his apartment complex, all smiles and sass and incredibly sexy and Britt knew there was only one safe course of action: they had to be strictly friends. Nothing more. Un-uh, no way. But... No matter how hard they resisted the pull between them, no matter how vehemently they rejected the idea of love and marriage, Britt and Ashley couldn't get away from one inexcapable fact: they might have started out as just friends, but that just wasn't enought anymore."
4,it's an almost perfect game,"I hate to admit it, but I'm obsessed with this game. There's only one thing I don't like about it: The search system. It gets so annoying if you keep tapping Square in a place where you think the castle is and it's really on the next continent. Okay, that rarely happens, but still. It gets a lot easier when you get Kanon's sonar thingy. I also like the fact that the enemies wait for you to enter your commands in battle, then attack. I was devastated in FF8 because Ultima Weapon cast Meteor on me twice in a row while I was still telling Zell to cast Meltdown on him. In this game, I only have to worry once I enter the last command. I've never played the original Wild Arms, but I still like this game. If you like RPGs, I suggest you get it."
3,First Love/True Love?,"A thought provoking movie that intrigues as through the twists, you watch our heroine stumble her way onto the path of lasting love that had no boundaries."
4,Used in Colorado skiing,"Product worked great. Will be using for future trips, both in Colorado and local ski trips. Much easier than fumbling with the handset."
2,Worked for awhile,Used this for two weeks on a scout trip and it worked well. Could hear and be hard on it. Took it of the shelf and keyed it up with the same radio and it shut the radio down. Tried it with the other t three talkabout radios and it shut them down too. Don't think this is a quality problem but was disappointing.
3,Motorolla 53724 Walkie Talkies,"Products are good. Do NOT expect them to work at 25 miles. Range is a few miles for you to hear clearly. If your in the mountains and not in line of sight, you'll encounter a lot of static or no sound at all. Must be VERY careful not to speak too closely to the mic (either just the unit or using the handheld) or else voices come across very distorted. Definitely a good product, but with the above limitations."
1,Beware. Bait and Switch.,"My email to Solvit. I never received a reply.---On October 16, 2010, I bought the Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets.It was fantastic. Exceptionally well made. Looks great, fits great.On May 30, 2011, I bought another. Exactly the same product. Same model number. Same page on Amazon.This one is junk. Thin material, poorly constructed, feels cheap. I hate it.Both from Amazon. Both from the same product page.So my question. What happened in the space of one year?Here's what I think. I think you created an excellent product, collected the 5-star Amazon reviews, then switched to a cheaper manufacturer to save money.Am I wrong?---"
2,not-so-deluxe car seat cover,"Needs special care - clean any spills immediately, take to the laundromat for the large washers, etc. Cheaply made. Will not secure under the seat of your car if you have a fold-down seat like on a hatchback but, of course, no mention of this in the description. Next time, off to the pet store instead."
2,No good for leather seats,"As others have mentioned, this does not work well for leather seats. There is nothing anchoring the bottom center and the cover slips around as soon as the dog steps on it."
3,Great protection. Straps are a problem.,"Fits well in my Dodge Durango. Well made, with the exception of the straps. The straps will easily stretch out, which isn't a major problem, but it doesn't allow for a ""tight fit"" once thay have stretched out."
2,"Fits nicely, but HOLDS ODORS, it STINKS","This thing works good except that it holds odors and stinks all the time. You wash it and it smells OK. Your dog gets on it once or twice after a walk or a run in the park, and it will hold every odor forever. After a few days, it smells like your dog X10. So if you REALLY like the way your dog smells, you might be in heaven, but most folks will probably hate the odors that come from having this in your car on a hot summer day."
4,Great buy,"Just purchased a new car, and obviously want to keep the car in great condition. I decided on this seat cover for my very large German Shepard mix. Product fits almost perfectly and is very durable. My only issue is that the straps over the head rests do not bring the cover high enough to protect the entire back seat. This is not an issue for most dogs, but my dog is very large, so the top of the seats still get hair all over them. Not that big an issue, but for someone with a very large dog, can be slightly annoying.Nonetheless, extremely happy with the cover. It is easy to clean, very comfortable for the dog and stays in place once hooked in.Definitely would recommend."
4,Great coverage,"Was tired of all the dirty paws and fur on my leather seats so bought the Solvit seat cover. Love it! It's easy to take on and off and completely covers the seat. Haven't tried to wash it yet, but it's made well and there shouldn't be a problem. Highly recommend this product."
2,"Straps are terrible, the body of it is good.","If you live anywhere in the world where there is sun, the straps that are supposed to hold this cover onto your back seat will disintegrate. The main part, where the dog sits, however, is sturdy and keeps the back seat of the car dry. It's just a shame we can't use it due to the straps not holding the thing up! Useless pile of crap that I wish I could return, but now have to take the time to repair."
5,Perfect!,"Got the cover earlier than promised, put it in that day. I was impressed with the quality and it fits perfectly. It stays in place on the fabric seats and has holes for seat belts so I can use the car harness for my dog and my daughter can ride on the other side belted in. Its easy to install and remove, too. I wish they offered it in black or grey to match the interior of my car tho."
4,Works really well,"This is a areally great product for what it is designed to do! I have three big dogs and this has saved my car seats from wet muddy paws and endless amounts of dog hair! The price is fantastic and so is the product. If I could buy this seat cover for my front seat also, I probably would"
4,Seat cover for dog,I order this cover and it came in about three days which was well ahead of when it was suppose to be here. I installed it on the back seat of my Prius and it fit well. The dog likes the material it is made out of as she doesn't slide all over on it like she did on the last one we had. Only complaint is that the lower elastic straps need to be adjustable so they work better on a smaller car.
5,Works very well,"I am very happy with my new seat cover. I had 4 larges dogs in my back seat and the cover worked very well. The cover stayed put and protected my seat, even with all the dogs and their activity."
3,Bench seat cover for pets,"This bench seat cover is great for washing, but it lacks a good way to keep it in place on the back of the seat. Once the dogs walk around and laydown and get up it starts to streatch eventually the elastic will come apart. Would not buy again."
3,Deluxe Bench Seat Cover for Pets,"I am having trouble hooking the bottom, not sure if my car has a place under seat to hook. Otherwise it just moves around when the dog is in the car. defeats the purpose."
4,dog blanket for vehicle,Received my order in timely manner. Fits the back seat of my car great. Protects the seat from my dog and good fit on the seat. Happy with this product!
1,terrible concept,"I do not own this. I do have several carnivorous seedlings that I've grown from seeds from a reputable source (Int. Carnivorous Plant Society or Sarracenia Northwest). Heed these warnings on here and avoid this. The entire concept is wrong.Why does amazon as me ""how do you rate this toy overall""? A TOY?!? These are NOT toys. They are challenging plants to raise from seeds. Avoid it."
1,Grow some sunflowers instead..,"I tried Dunecraft cacti kit with my kids, following instructions without result. Wrote the company and got another set of seeds. New attempt without result.My kids got the carnivorous kit as a present (no gift receipt unfortunately). We went through the whole ordeal of keeping the kit in the refrigerator and then giving it sunlight and having it around for months without any show of life.The kits comes in boxes with pictures of seductive jungle like vegetation. Looks too good to be true...guess what...it is.The company responds to complaints with bombastically immature verbiage such as ""completely unfounded and incorrect""...""insulted by false allegations""....meanwhile this product is marketed to children with images promising a little garden of Eden.Well, I guess it is a good lesson (though expensive) to teach kids about marketing and how to take life's disappointments..."
2,it took YEARS,"2 YEARS! I got this in the summer of '09, set it up right away and noticed sprouts a few months ago. On top of that the only thing that sprouted was a lonely venus flytrap. The only reason i kept it so long was because it was growing sphagnum moss which i harvested and used as a top dressing for my other carnivorous plants. So don't give up, if you wait long enough it just might work...or you could just buy plants from your local nursery or online. (i use california carnivores)"
1,Great for anything except the seeds included,"Not one plant grew. If you put your own seeds in there, then it works great. Basically a very expensive plastic pot."
3,Good one,It is German commander report on D - Day. It is good for serious military student to know Normandy deeply and know what German thought and did. Its only disadvantage is lack of hard data with the exception of 719th infantry division. Reader should look it up in Mr Zetterling 's Normandy 1944 for hard data and informaton
5,"great show, but where's the rest of the seasons?","a true classic tv-show! I really loved it; I had taped several episodes from tv, but they were broadcasted randomly, but with this release I was looking forward to have the episodes on dvd, and in the correct order.I don't understand the complaints about the picture quality; it looks fine to me!the only thing I want now is to complete this series, but I guess I can dream on, because according to some reviews the release of the rest of the seasons is cancelled.It makes me really mad, why do they do that?!!!I can't stand to own an incomplete set, and now I've got this one incomplete, the jefferson series incomplete, and I'm also collecting Cheers, I love Lucy, Sandford&son, married with children and good times. I do hope they will release all seasons of these series, and a little quicker than 2 or 3 seasons a year. My God, at this rate it will take 5 years to complete the series, if they don't get cancelled again after 2 season.Columbia, shame on you!"
4,fam guy fan,i am a family guy fan I always love these shows. Wasnt the best episode but still awesome. two thumbs up!
5,Best White Rice Flour Available,Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Rice Flour is the best! It is fine grain and makes your baked goods a finer texture.
5,An Unforgettable era,"Who can forget one of the most laughable T.V. show ever, Sanford and Son brought in new laughs over the tube back in the 70's and still is one of my favorates today. Each season has great laughable moments to watch over and over again, ""They sure don't make'm like this anymore."" Excellent!"
2,"Nascar fans may know what's going on, but not the rest of us","This book may be for Nascar fans, but for those reading it to find out what Nascar is all about, it isn't very informative. If you read it to try to learn abut Nascar, it won't help you. If you read it like any other novel with Nascar as a backdrop to stories about a bus-load of characters, it might be okay. It isn't great for either."
2,where's the erotic color prints ?,"Expecting a collection as the title, of color prints, however much disappointed, only a few color prints in the two book volume, and a few non-color prints, hundreds of pages of worded narrative, but almost no color prints, and for this price the reader wants dozens of color prints."
2,I'll do anything you want.,"This is an album of women making obscene crank phone calls. It is occasionally funny, but it's mostly just embarrassing."
1,SEX! DRUGS! SUICIDAL THOUGHTS! A SORDID LIFE THAT FAILS TO SCORE,"The former New York Giants offensive lineman details --- often too graphically --- his ""secret"" life ... alleging being raped by a neighbor at age 11; frequent orgies of gin guzzling, Quaalude popping, crack snorting, pot smoking and cocaine freebasing; dressing in drag; prostituting himself for $15 to $20 a pop; stealing and shoplifting and other sundry headline grabbing actions. Think of the tome as a super bowl overflowing with sordid tales from a sordid life --- Simmons swears he was spending $1,000 a day on drugs --- and you'll score a touchdown."
3,good,"1. I rely on this feedback so I will contribute.2. the book gives two sides, hard tough feet or soft supple feet. You have to decide where you fall. Then only do you get a barrage of info that conflicts one after another.3. yes, it is helpfull and I have learned a good deal.4. as there is no ""Right"" way about things, those who need black and white, this or that, will have a hard time. I did.5. what did humans do before shoes, Sneakers, and boots? Bottom line, we are already well engineered. I say, find footwear or foot care that really solves ""that"" problem. otherwise, bare feet and sandals are all I need.-Bill, USA"
4,Focus on runners' feet issues,"If you are a runner, this is an excellent book to have as a reference. It goes into great detail regarding issues a long distance runner may encounter and ways to treat the problem. The author seems to have been a runner and managed first hand many runner feet issues. Other sports feet issues are given a summary nod. I could easily give this book a five star if it discussed plantar fasciitis in greater detail. A lot of reference web sites are identified."
4,A Must Read for all Runners,"Great advice on how to take care of your feet from an expert. As an ultra runner I have had my share of frustrating feet issues. I have also see really strong runners side lined with stress fractures and p.f. I would love to avoid that! His style is a little patronizing but I didn't mind. He gives great advice on how to protect your feet, how to make them stronger to avoid injury and what to do if you have foot pain."
1,Pee Eeww....what flooded bookstore did this book come from?,"Book arrived, but it had very strong , moldy musty smell, so I immediately threw it out , for health and safety reasons. I'd love to know where the book was sourced and/or stored. Won't use this seller again, too many other options."
3,NOT Spiral-Bound,"I just received my book today. I haven't had time to sit down and play it, but it looks like a solid collection of songs at the skill level that I was looking for. I was sadly disappointed, however, when I opened my Amazon package and saw that my 400 page paperback piano book is NOT spiral-bound like the other reviewer's was. I would not have ordered it if I had known that. It will be a definite challenge to keep it open while playing."
3,Bleh,"This was not the best movie I have ever seen, however, it was cheap and I was bored...it was entertaining for the hour that I watched."
1,Hope to see it soon,"I hope it's a great movie.The box looks great. But, I do not know because it still has not arrived yet. I've been waiting for 1month and 2 weeks now and nothing from dvd legacy! Thanks Alot!"
3,Go Lion!,"Got it to replace a missing lion mascot suit. The kids liked it, but it ws really hot, and hard to manuever the heavy head."
1,Weak for Stasheff,"This book is kind of weak, especially for for his ""Gallowglass"" series of books. Its almost as if Stasheff himself is kind of done with the ""demcracy vs. dictatorship"" thing. A lot of the plot points he starts peter out and are wrapped up is a somewhat lame fashion at the end. Its almost as if he did not have the time or interest to properly finish the book. Stasheff is a great author, but this one is lacking."
1,BUGS BUGS BUGS!!!,"STAY AWAY - WILL CRASH YOUR SYSTEM CONSTANTLY - EA HAS LIED BY SUGGESTING THIS IS NOT A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM. THE SAME CODE IS IN ALL GAMES, THE PROBLEM IS 100% - WAIT UNTIL A RECALL OR A PATCH - I AM OUTRAGED AT THIS USELESS GAME AND AM WAITING TO HEAR HOW I CAN GET MY $50 BACK"
2,EA Sports - It ISN'T in the Game,"This is a disasterous game. You can not make it through Franchise mode without playing the same game 4 times because of the software conflicts which turns off the system COMPLETELY! Along with it shutting off the PSP, the graphics are not that far from the playstation and there is NO Play REVIEWS!? no challenges? I thought this year there are challenges. Again, too bad Madden signed his life over to EA Sports. Do not buy this game, Seriously. EA Games on the other hand has BURNOUT LEGENDS. IT IS A WORTHY GAME, The Graphics are outstanding. I suppose each division of EA has it's own standards. Dont fault EA GAMES, FAULT EA SPORTS."
3,Freezes up,"The graphics are outstanding for the platform they are on, franchise mode is extremely involved, the gameplay is rather fun.The only knock I have on this game is that it is constantly freezing up! There is nothing more frustrating than getting to the third quarter of a game and having it freeze up on you. The game locks up and then the PSP shuts off, wasting alot of time."
5,Love Good Times!!!,I grew up watching Good Times with my parents and now my kids watch it with me! Love this show! Especially the early episodes with the father still there.
5,Important look into society - a must read for everyone!,"It is unfortunate that this book has been given one star based on its price. I took a class with Dr. Frost who is one of the authors and the reason the book is so expensive is because of the publisher who didn't think it would make a good profit as a mainstream book, so its really marketed more for scholarly circles, which is also unfortunate because I think a lot of people could benefit from reading it especially given the state of the world today.The authors explore the concept of ""ameaningful thinking"" and ""moral sadism"" (the original title of the book, turned down by publishers bc of their fear that it had sexual connotations)They focus on child rearing, education, the work place, and religion as facets that can promote ameaningful thinking and lead to ""justified"" and socially sanctioned violence against others.Anyone who values critical thinking and individuality and wants to make a difference in the world should read this book!"
1,$41 for a tiny 130 page $1.95 paperback!,"This is a very interesting read, but no amount of brilliance can excuse the moral cruelty of charging $41 for a pocket size paperback."
4,great stuff,"What a nice eclectic assortment of songs. I wish Amazon could offer some downloads to hear. I would include ""Watch Them Fall"" for sure. Great stuff."
3,Boring...,"Erotic - devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire. It was very difficult for me to read Brown Sugar 3 because the majority of the stories did not meet the dictionary definition of erotic. Although, I did enjoy the stories by Preston Allen, Denene Millner, Nick Chiles, and Lolita Files, there just were not enough bright spots for me to call this collection of so-called erotic stories good.Based on my personal definition of erotic I would give this book one star. However, I realize that what I would find erotic others may view as pornographic. Hence, I must be fair and give this book three stars. People who have not graduated from the missionary position may find the stories exciting.Euftis"
3,Never Again,"Never again will I be drawn into the writings of Linda Evans. ""Far Edge of Darkness"" was an excellent book, totally destroyed by the author's inconsiderate termination of the series a the end of the first book, leaving the reader in Limbo. Since this is the second time I have experienced Ms Evans inconsiderate writing style, I will never again read anything of hers. It is obvious she had an idea, wrote what she could, then lost interest and didn't care what her readers felt."
4,Excellent but strange.,"Excellent, IF one can relish in parallels of strange father - son relationships. An interesting amplification of many (not typical) strong/stern fathers to diligent sons. I am doubtful it will be enjoyed by the masses. I would rate it a very well done, very offbeat, study of (a-typical) Fathers and Sons. I watch it occasionally and draw parallels to my life vis a vis my father."
5,basic Tsukamoto,Basic Tsukamotoit's a very nice interview with the cult director Shinya Tsukamoto... a must for who wants to know more about his work.
1,Book review,"I was learning to use SPSS. Really did not find the book helpful. Not well-written. If you need a book to teach you SPSS, this is not it."
2,singig in the rain,"Sorry, I don't care for the tinny quality of the music.only one song ( Kelly singing in the rain ) sounded good.The recoding is like hearing a 1930 cartoon."
3,Disappointed,"One of the other reviewers mentioned that the dialogue, tapping, applause, etc. included in previous releases of this soundtrack were annoying. I must disagree. I believe that THIS release, especially without the tap, is both annoying and boring. The dialogue and tapping are parts of the songs for me...part of the rhythm. Without them, the songs lose their spark. Even my 4-year old son noticed the absence of the dialogue and tapping. I was highly disappointed with this CD and now I'm frustrated because I cannot find a CD version to replace the old, worn out (though still wonderful) cassette we have been listening to."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS CD",I just got this soundtrack for Christmas and I love it! It has great sound and the songs are fun and make me want to dance!!
3,Not a great addition to our Leap Library,"Although my four-year-old daughter loves Leap's Birthday Hunt, she rarely uses this book. The story isn't as engaging as the Leap stories and the games aren't as interactive and fun. From now on, we're sticking to the Leap series."
4,pretty good,"I first tried the 19"" sharp but it was just too small and the picture was not very sharp. So, I spent the extra money for the 20"" and there's a huge difference. It's a really great picture and the sound level is better compared to other sets this size. My only problem I have is that I feel the remote control is not very responsive. It is slow to change channels, there is a significant delay so if you're a surfer, it's a little annoying. Other than that, I'm happy with the choice."
2,A disappointing and brief biography of Luigi Colani,"I had high expectations of the book, as not many books have been written about the inventor of ""bio-design"". But I was rather disappointed. The first section is a very brief review of Luigi Colani's life, and describes some of his designs. The second half of the book is cobbled together from three interviews done over a number of years. There are no real new insights into the man behind the all the bravado and rhetoric.The translation into English from the original French was not very well done. There are numerous spelling mistakes and errors. There are black and white photographs in the main text, but many of these are poorly reproduced. The colour photographs at the rear of the book are small and few in number; this is a great pity as Colani is famous for his many flamboyant designs. There are better books about Luigi Colani and his designs than this one."
1,Not for me!,"It was way too slow for me personally. Plus I never felt close to the main character - there were too many others. Julia kept coming in and out of the picture not playing the part I thought she would. She could/should have played a bigger role since she was there right after the murder.The book has possibilities,but it was not my style."
4,A book of little maps with numbers,"This book contains nothing except outlines of maps, then inside maps are various sections with numbers on them. A list follows indexing the map number to a place. Not what I thought it would be ... but will most likely prove worth the heft price for a small paperback at some point."
3,Very Good,I like Psalms and the rest of the songs. I bought this for my Mother also. She was delighted with CD.
2,Flute book purchase,"This book was purchased for my daughter. Her lesson instructor requested she purchase it. It's supposed to be a book that includes pieces for flute and piano. She plays the flute, and there was no flute music enclosed. I was told I would have to order it again and hope I got all the pages to the book. Luckily I didn't pay very much for this book and luckily a friend of hers owns the same book so we were able to copy the 70 or so pages she needed. This is unacceptable."
5,Great puncher for the price!!,This is one awesome puncher....it will punch 40 sheets too with no problem.....I am glad I finally decided to order this puncher because it sure beats the smaller ones which can take forever to punch a stack of papers. Thanks
3,It's great for coverage on my back and ...,"It's great for coverage on my back and hard-to-reach places because I don't have to rub it in. However, when I forgot it contained alcohol and sprayed it on my freshly shaved legs, it stung. It's easy to apply, but if I spray too much it makes me feel sticky. It smells when I spray it on, but as soon as it dries it doesn't smell like anything. It doesn't moisturize like the lotion sunscreens, so I'd recommend it to somebody who has oily or normal skin. I didn't like using it on my face. Overall a pretty good product. I gave it three stars because it works well, but the alcohol doesn't make it good for after showers, and it sometimes made my arms sticky."
5,Getting Loaded,Excellent book for anyone over 20 wanting to invest in their future. Easy reading with a funny quips. Best no nonsense advice that's easily understood and followed. Great gift for college grad.
5,This book blows!,"Why wasn't this book around 25 years ago. It's cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars!!!Seriously, the book is great. I picked it up at the local library's booksale for $.50 (Ha! I learn fast).While aimed at the 20-30 something crowd, where it's advice will do the most good, (time really IS money, apparently) it does have a slew of practical ""secret's"" that will save anyone with patience and commonsense from uberconsumerism.It's quick pace, short chapters and witty writing style pretty much ensures that when I pass this book on to my 24 year old son he'll actually read the thing (or else!)."
4,A chronicle of how a genre influenced young america,"For anyone wondering why hip-hop has outlasted other music genres such as punk rock, one should look no further than ""Hip Hop America"" I feel that this book is a definitive history of where this music/cultural movement has been, and a small hint of where it's going. Nelson George examines the connections between hip-hop and it's counterparts in ""mainstream"" culture(as in his previous effort, ""Elevating the Game: Black Men and Basketball"")from a ardent fan's perspetive. My only criticism is that its that George is so intimate with the subject that it keeps him from adopting the proper balance that is a must for any journalist of his stature. Despite its sometimes aggravating faults, this is a book that I highly reccomend for hip-hop novices and veterans alike."
2,I love Nirvana and bought this CD,I don't think you should by this cd. It is not as good as Krist could have done. You will by it and never listen to it. The only reason to by this CD is to get the Nirvana Collection.
5,Best price yet!,Must use these for my water maker and the price has gone up from my original source. This is the best price I have found. Will continue to buy from this seller untill I find a better price.
3,pictures do not represent actual Turkey,"Even though it is a short book, it talks about bunch of stuff from politics to the foods and informed its readers well. On the other hand, the pictures that were chosen are misrepresenting Turkey. All of them are from the east side of Turkey and generally poor people or street children. Well, this is not only this book's mistake, I observed this in tens of different books about Turkey. When the westerners see these pictures, they think that Turkish people are like Iranians, Iraqis or Afghans. They do not know that the majority of Turkish people look like Italians, French, Spanish or Americans."
3,Not Worth Nine Bucks,"Yes, a sweet book, as others have described it. But, I was a tad disappointed that it was so thin when I received it. I would not have paid nine bucks for this book if I had seen it first. This is the type of book I would pick up at a gift shop for three or four dollars, max. Still contemplating returning this one; I wouldn't even have to box it up - just stick it in an envelope and mail it back."
2,Garage Band Muzak,"Honestly, the rhythm sounded like one of those cheap keyboard pre-recorded beats. The nature sounds weren't natural - for instance, the ocean waves were individual and timed to beat. There are so many better nature CDs out there - go find them!"
3,Game for Son,"My son researched this purchase. He was very pleased with the price, delivery timeframe and the game."
3,Get a Real Shortwave Radio Instead,"I got this little boat anchor a while back. It was to replace a dead GE portable. I had the radio about a week when one of the dial lights went out; a week or so later the other one was gone. And it is impossible (for my fat fingers) to replace the bulbs. The tuning is horrible at best; it will not stay on frequency and the linear dial is way, way off (tune 1260 AM to get 890 AM). I am happy that I did not pay anywhere near what they're selling for now. I do love the look and it sits next to me on a table where I read and listen to standard FM. This is not a radio for a novice SWL or even an experienced one like me. Get a Kaito, Eton, or even a Grundig S350DL which I listen to regularly."
1,Ersatz Style/Mediocre performance,"Grundig's Classic is designed to call to mind the wonderful days of sitting around the radio listening to Fibber McGee and Molly, but most of the materials used in this presentation weren't even invented then. then it was labor, now its injection molding. It looks cheap as a result.And, it doesn't perform as well as a portable battery powered Sony. With the exception of AM broadcasts. If you need to hear a ballgame in the middle of nowhere, this is for you. If not look again."
1,Why is this recommended?,"It may be a fine product but it does NOT work with the 7 cup model. We tried.After going back to the reviews, I find similar statements. We will have to find another solution for our Cuisinart DLC-5 blades."
5,SAFE way to store blades,"This is a well-designed box. It holds the blades and discs without dulling them and locks very securely. Read the directions carefully because the latch is not intuitive, but once you understand it, it's fast and totally secure. I wouldn't know how to store my blades and discs without it!"
5,Happy to find this blade and disc holder,I was happy to find this blade and disc holder; especially when I didn't have to pay shipping charges! Blades and discs are now safely displayed and easy to find.
3,Cheap plastic,"Theory is great (how else do you store all those discs?), but the execution is poor. Plastic is cheap. Lock doesn't really work properly. Most importantly: it only holds 3 discs. What are you supposed to do with the rest of them? Buy another case, apparently. But then you have to figure out what case the disc you want is in. I would have expected Cuisinart to do better."
4,Safety First,"I bought this after getting a processor because I have small children in the house. The latch is difficult to get used to, and I don't think it would be too much for my young child to open. The container itself is well organized and keeps everything handy. I would buy this product again, but wish the company would include this device with the processor for safety reasons."
3,Fun For Kids,This was fun for the boys when they first got it. Now I need to have their mother find it and the electronic leap pad it goes on so the baby can use it.
4,music for a hot bath,"This album is wonderful. The production is much more slick than its predecessor, Blind. Harriet's smooth, sincere voice goes perfectly with the guitars. A tad sappy (cry, When I'm Thinking about you) occasionally rocky (another flavor- my personal fave), this album delivers. It is more mature than Reading, and that is a good thing. This is in the same vein as Mojave 3, only less self-conscious. If this album were a food, it would be Fried wontons with Tons of duck sauce."
3,Sundays are better than others.,"First of all, unlike the Amazon reviewer, I would never call this a ""shoegazer"" band, though there may be subtle similarities. Also, as much as I have loved them since 1990, I just don't enjoy this album as much as the first two. It's still good of course, and is typical Sundays, but other than a few tracks, there's less magic. Harriet does still sound angelic though. ""Summertime"" which is the hit here is nice, but too happy for me. The only song I really truly love is ""When I'm Thinking About You"". Again, overall it's good, but I would first get the debut, or ""Blind""."
3,Still a good album,"Harriet Wheeler is in the same ability league as Pat Benatar and Ann Wilson etc. The band also has a unique style and sound that creates unexpected non-cliche music. Refreshing to say the least. This is not the best album. ""Blind"" is the masterpiece, followed by their debut then this. This one is still good, though, compared to what else the record companies are offering these days."
5,Black Lab,"Why didn't they release some videos (other than time ago, and I think wash it away might have been a video)? I think i read somewhere someone saying that they should have released all the money in the world as a video. I think that x-ray could've made a pretty good video, or even she sleeps with angels. Anyway, this is one of the best, if not the best, cd I own. I think that they should get rid of their manager, or whoever didn't do their marketing right."
5,A highly informative and understandable resource,"This is the best book I have read on the subject for adults with learning disabilities. Shapiro and Rich write in a way that is easily understandable by laymen and also in a way that is highly informative. If you have a learning disability, you can easily relate to their examples of other real people with similar problems and learn how LD problems are diagnosed, what causes the problem and treatment methods, including strategies and drugs. I would certainly reccommend this book for any adult who has a learning disability or simply wants to learn more"
1,sound but no picture,"The movie starts out as expected but then about 3 minutes into it, it lost the picture while the audio continued. Looking at the disc I couldn't detect any obvious damage. I should have returned it, but I hate mailing things back."
2,This textbook stinks...,"This book is unorganized, out-of-date, too focused on New York City, and on every other page promotes the authors and their careers...On page 7 they are telling you how much has changed with the computer age, and the internet, and one of the authors tells you he went to grade school and they used quill pens and fountain jars...okay, I didn't need to know that. It was so annoying that by page 14, I was going to submit to them a list of improvements, but it would have been EXTENSIVE! From there on just gritted my teeth and got through it...Good luck! You'll be really tired of the references to the Trade City Bombing, and NYC in general, by the end of it!"
2,A distant second to Sony,"There really aren't many shortwave radios left on the market as everyone moves to internet. If you're planning to own one, you might as well get the best, and Grundig certainly isn't it. Reception is weak, no matter where you place the radio, and sound quality is definitely tinny. My cousin bought the Sony IF 7600G and I wish I had done the same!!"
1,anything for a dollar,"This just proves that people will do anything to make money.Hey, I know, I'll come out with ""Frame A Dog"". You just buy your dog and sandwich him between two pieces of glass and hang him up on your wall.He will love not having to bother with running around, or playing, or any of that other lame stuff that the other dogs do.Maintenance is easy. You just shove some food in one side, and hang a bag below the frame on the other side.You will like it in your office.What a joke. This is possibly the worst idea of all time, and only a totally ignorant, uncaring ingrate would possibly want one of these torture devices on their wall."
3,light broke,love it but cant find a replacement for the light. it broke and is impossible to replace. does anyone know where i can get at light fixture similar or exact without purchasing a new one?help me find the light!j o v e n o r o z c o
4,a few ace tracks,"yes in recent years the quality control has slipped amongst the piles of SIzzla releases, (with some albums being entirely forgettable - Stay Focus for instance), but there are a few tunes on this number which are tip-top.the Bob Dylan song (forget the name), done in a bright timbre blissed out dub sound, and the Rasta boy's pleading voice works perfectly - ""you don't need the weatherman to know which way the wind blows"" - indeed.and the cross-over banger ""Got It Going On"" bumps righteous with a subtle egyptian keyboard line."
3,a few good tracks,"while I did enjoy a few of the tracks on this albumn , I felt that overall it was a weak product , inferior to other albumns I've enjoyed by sizzla . . .I would recommend instead of this albumn either ""bobo ashanti"" or ""da real thing"" both by sizzla ."
4,Does just what it should,"This is a good product to use while exercising, if you are exerting yourself it will replenish your energy. It taste a bit like eating strawberry jam, however."
4,That's a good shot,The Clif shot gives me energy during my ride and tastes pretty good. A little difficult to consume while cycling though.
2,Clif Shot Gel Cherry Chocolate,I bought this flavor of Clif Shot because it was the cheapest and I learned to pay the extra for the Mocha (5 Star) flavor. Overall the gel is good but I'm not a big fan of the cherry chocolate flavor.
5,never leave home without them,"I use Clif products. I think that their energy bars are not only the best tasting on the market but the healthiest by far. Now as far as the energy gels go. I have tried the competitor's packets. They pale in comparison as far as taste,performance and ingredients. Clif uses natural and organic ingredients. And they do give the boost that is needed when used properly. I like the fact that they are relatively low on the sodium side and higher on the potassium. Yes sodium is an electrolyte but Americans get excessive sodium as it is in our diets. Bottom line- best taste, works the best and most wholesome ingredient list (no artificial stuff or lab creations)."
5,Amazing Grace,"I first read this book while at school (some 20 years ago).It is about a nun who enters the ""real"" world and encounters experiences that are totally new to her i.e. mainly sexual. Alida Baxters wit is well displayed in this novel.I was so impressed that I decided to investigate other novels by her, unfortuanetely getting hold of her books is extremely difficult as they are now out of print.Anway I shall keep searching all those second hand book shops.Definetely recommended.KEL"
1,I threw it away,"For those who for years have loved ""The Story of O"", this book is an affront. It is badly written and emphatically not erotic. Please save your money."
4,Very nice but misleading,The border has a very nice soft yellow and blue colour combination but it is misleading as it only goes from A to C. I thought it would have had the whole alphabet.
4,Verry good so far,love it. Better the the sony MD player i have not as small though.Pros1. store a lot of music on one cd2. very good sound quality very cosmizible equlizer.3. lightwieght4. not half bad price.Cons1. makes verry wiered noise when finding music and somthimes stps and says no disk.2 no back light is what everyone else has I can see were they are going but I can live without it.3. feels verry fragel
3,Ken fell down and lost his crown,"This doll could be constructed better. Once his crown was removed it's impossible to attach it back so it stays on. I would only recommend buying it to complete the set. Also, why aren't more caucasian dolls available? I had to special-order a caucasian doll. There are plenty of ethnic PrinceEric dolls available."
4,almost perfect,"This was exactly what my five year old grandson wanted and arrived on schedule and in near perfect condition. I was surprised to find a quarter inch of fine black powder in the bottom of the sealed box, but fortunately, it had not discolored the doll's clothing. Perhaps moisture entered the package while it was in storage and created mold? Not sure, but I would assume this was a fluke and would still recommend this product to others."
3,"The last sorcerer,","Having read many biographies of Einstein and Feynman, I was happy to find this book on Newton. It gave a good background about his early years.I did have trouble keeping my interest. Not that Newton was not interesting, perhaps the author did not do such a good job of giving me a good reason to keep turning the page, I was glad to be done with it."
4,Flows like a novel,"This work is carefully documented and quite detailed, however it presents the man's life as if read in a novel. The life of Sir I is not an easy one to tell because of the intricate nature of his character; yet, for me, it was an informative, enjoyable read. Once read, you will come away with a deeper understanding of the complex mind of this great scientist."
1,poor,"I am very disappointed in this product. It is not intuitive, Help is written poorly and hard to follow. In addition, the software registration kept failing and would only proceed in the trial mode, which actually cancels the software's eligibility for tech support. This purchase turned out a complete waste of money for me."
1,I agree with everyone else.,"Just wanted to put my two cents in. If nothing else, they should have released the 1st season if they wanted to test demand. (""Test Demand?"" a show that ran for 11 years and is still in mass syndication everywhere needs to ""test demand""?) MWC is a landmark in TV sitcoms, even if the critics fail to recognize it as such. This is one of the few times, when everything, writing, premise, characters, and actors fell into place.WE NEED THE ENTIRE SEASON RUNS!""It's marriage of convenience. Unfortunately, not mine.""- Al Bundy"
2,Married With Children vol 1 & 2,"I used to watch the show when it was on TV ... funny stuff, and Kelly WOW!!! I was very disappointed in these two ""best of"" DVD's....don't waste your money. The shows selected were stupid and not funny at all."
3,"Pretty good, kind of confusing","I started reading this series after I read Neil Gaiman's Books of Magic miniseries, which is really really good. Unfortunately I've only been able to get ahold of 2, 3, and 4, this one. The plot isn't as good as Gaiman's, it's just not quite as convincing as a real world that exists beside our own, something that Gaiman and the Sandman in particular are phenomenal at. But I still enjoyed this book. The art was nice and I especially like the addition of Tim's girlfriend Molly, who's quite a bit of fresh air. Since I came in on the middle of this story though, I couldn't quite grasp what was going on at times."
1,Neo-Intellectual Twaddle.,"A writing that the British wartime ""Ministry Of Information"" or their American counterparts would have been proud of. Indeed, it may have had some relevance as valuable propaganda at that time. Today it merely serves to perpetuate ignorant prejudice. There is no scholarly merit in this book whatsoever and the author is clearly more concerned with currying favour among Jewish pressure groups than analyising Richard Wagner and/or his music."
1,Don't waste your time,"The book is a collection of haphazrd details none of them of any significance. The style of the narrative: to start with an everyday event and roll it into something significant, is borrowed, and used very poorly in every chapter. It appears that Mr. Hibbert read ""official"" english records and letters of the non-historic survivors and believed them to be the truth. There are no other facts or ancedotes except that of the English. English savagery is described as a matter of law and order and is lauded, natives are deemed barbaric, fiendish and ungrateful in their acts of savagery. There is no detail of the Mutineers other than that they mutinied under the influence of bhang (marijuana) and opium. It's unimaginable that Mr. Hibbert is considered a historian, who's only contribution is to be the first to use the word ""badmash"" on almost every page in an english book.I would have given this book a zero, but Amazon doens't allow that!"
3,Mixed Bag,I am a first semester non-Economics PhD student.Text is pretty clear and concise. Prior knowledge of microeconomics is helpful and expected for the book.Unfortunately this edition (the 2nd) seems to suffer from some errors in the answers to problems in the back of the book which makes use of it frustrating. Problems are good tests of skills for each chapter.The book is appropriate for teaching the material it covers at the level it is geared for.
3,It's okay.,It is okay but it doesn't come with the pieces to put on the board. I only receive the board so I was unhappy about my mistake...
3,Left Me Wanting More...,"There is no doubt that this book will make a lovely addition to the coffe table library. Beautifully illustarted and informative I was pleased overall. I have to grant only 3 stars, however, because of the mildly disappointing number of 3D images, several of which are repeated more than once. Still.. a keeper."
5,FATE IS REMARKABLE COLLECTOR'S EDITION BY BETTY NEELS,"FATE IS REMARKABLE IS SEARCH OF COMPANIONSHIP AND ROOTS. ""WHY are you so surprised?"" Hugo asked. ""We're well suited, you know......many marriages succeed very well on mutual respect and liking-and I ask no more than that of you, Sarah---at least until such a time as you might feel you have more to offer!"" Sarah Dunn had worked with Hugo Van Elven for a long time, and she was astounded when he suddenly proposed to her. Both of them were still smarting from previous unhappy love affairs which was why Sarah decided to accept; surely neither of them would wish to get emotionally involved again for a very long time?"
4,Cuisinart Blades,"I don't yet own this specialty set, but am delighted to find it here on line after searching in stores. One of my family recipes are Polish-style potatoe pancakes made with grated raw potatoes, flour, egg and seasonings. What a chore to grate the potatoes by hand! If the fine grated does this job, my family will enjoy this treat that they love more often, and my knuckles won't need to be included in the dish!"
2,Buyer be aware: For the older 14 cup models,"These do not work with the new 14 cup Elite model food processor. The packaging states is is for all 14 cup models, buyer be aware. ( so it got 2 stars)I returned, and will just have to wait and see if they make the specialty discs for the 14 cup Elite model."
3,"an interesting topic, and train of logic, but unpolished","I liked many aspects of the book, but overall, found it to be generally light reading, touching only briefly on deeper social issues."
2,"An ok idea, but terrible writing","The overall ideas are good, both the major premise driving the story as well as the bubble environments used for research and some interaction. I particularly enjoyed the panic the lead character experiences the few times he's forced to communicate without the available metaphors that are typically generated for him when he uses his bubble.But that is all there is to enjoy. The writing is simply amateurish, and certain key associations are beaten to death...This is a second draft, not a finished book. At times it was so difficult to read I had to put it down and read some magazine article simply to be able to trudge on and find out the ending. I can't get myself to read the sequel, even though I did finish this one."
2,Not representative of Grundig's fine reputation,"The Grundig G2000A World Receiver is not a valid represenatative of Grundig quality or performance. For a much better value (at only [amount]additional)the Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE is the standard by which all other popular priced SW radios are judged. Excellent value, excellent performer. (...)"
2,"Cool Radio, but an Awful Shortwave Radio","This is a nice radio. Cool design and nice to keep on your desk and use to listen to FM or AM radio stations. That's why I'm giving it two stars - because of design. If it wasn't for the the design, I wouldn't give it more than one star. The reason being that I expect a product (especially a Grundig product) marketed as a shortwave radio to actually be able to pick up some shortwave radio stations. I have had this piece for 3-4 years now, and I have still not been able to make it pick up a single shortwave radio station successfully. There are about three stations it finds, but barely. The signal it picks up is so weak one can't hear a single word. If you like a nice piece of very well designed radio to keep on your desk or nightstand, buy it. If you're looking for a shortwave radio, look somewhere else."
1,Not Much dependability or durability,"I received this model as a gift from my wife about six years ago. She thought its short wave feature would interest me. That feature never actually never worked, unless you are fluent in Russian or Polish. For most of its life, it spent more time in a dresser drawer than traveling with me. Its AM tuning was short lived, its FM tuning had a habit of drifting, and its its battery life was short, so I used its transformer function, ac to dc 4.5. Finally, the power button gave out. You would press it down. In two seconds, it would pop right out. I was checking to see if there was a repair center when I came on Amazon. Now, I'm putting it in the trash. WMT"
4,Good Quality Halloween Costume,This costume was warm enough for a Michigan Halloween and will hold up for more of our children.
5,Truly a Gentleman,"This book greatly affected me. I have been a DeForest Kelley fan for 30 years. When I heard of his passing, I worried about the nature of his last days, as I had been involved in the caregiving of my grandmother when she was dying. Ms. Smith's memoir is everything I hoped it would be: a loving remembrance and fitting tribute to a kind, decent man; a solid reassurance that his last days were dignified and devoid of unnecessary anxiety; a concise analysis of the confusing emotional toll sometimes resulting from caregiving; and an exhilirating confirmation of the kind of man Mr. Kelley was. I recommend this book to any DeForest Kelly fan or anyone who has ever lost a dear one to cancer. Thank you for writing Ms. Smith!"
4,Mommyheads? Really? Yes Really.,"First let me say I'm very late to the Mommyhead party, so I've a lot of catching up to do. This was my first exposure to this band. I realize the cd is several years old, so that has to factor in to my review. That being said, lets get on with it. Although dated, when I listen back to other music from the time that I liked (Uncle Green/Semisonic/to name a couple)at the time, it makes me wonder how I overlooked these guys. Their just as good and had plenty of potential. All the paying is first rate. Vocals are strong. Production simple yet effective. The songs are original and have something to say in a fresh way.Is this a good starting point? Yes, I'd say so. I was glad to find out they re-grouped and continued thier musical journey. I would like to tag along. You should too."
5,Helpful!,"After reading reviews on Amazon, I bought this book with a couple of others for my sister-in-law who moved to Maine. Within a week of moving to Maine, they got lost and used this atlas to find their way! They really like it."
4,A decent book.,"This was an entertaining read. The characters were full and descriptive, although in later chapters when new people showed up I felt I had forgotten a prior introduction to them and flipped back through the book looking for a reference that wasn't there. It was an odd way of introducing new characters: pretending they were there all along... The ending was slightly unsatisfying to me because of its lack of resolution, but that's a complaint I have a lot, and if you like that sort of thing, then you'll probably really like this book. I very much enjoyed it until the end didn't really end and that colored my opinion of the book as a whole."
3,REALLY wanted to like this...,"I REALLY felt kinda lost reading this book!! I had to flip backevery so often, thought I had missed some pages. The story jumpsaround alot. Seems like your dropped into so many story lines. Shetalks about characters and I found myself thinking - Huh? Who is shetalking about now. Interesting story, just doesn't read smoothly."
1,It stunk,Banks' deserved success with Girls Guide does not mean that she knows what she's doing. Apparently she doesn't
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing and I was looking forward to this book, but I was very disappointed with The Wonder Spot. The first thing I noticed was she used the words ""I said"", ""he said"" ""she said"" FAR FAR too often. Perhaps this was a creative choice, to use only the word ""said"" over and over and over again, but it came incredibly repetitive, particularly on the audiobook version. If this was a creative choice, it did not seem a very successful one. In addition, I found the main character entirely without any redeeming quality. She whined and complained constantly about her life, but did little to try to improve it and made just stupid, uninspired life choices repeatedly. I have little patience with that sort of thing and don't find it enjoyable to read about a woman with no direction. Overall, I was very disappointed and with the vast amount of books available in this genre, I doubt I read anything further from Ms. Bank."
1,I couldn't make it past chapter 3,"Like some of the other reviewers, I had eagerly awaited Melissa Bank's new book. ""The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" is one of my favorite books, and I've recommended it to friends and enjoyed discussing it.""The Wonder Spot"" failed to keep my attention and interest in the first three chapters. I can't fault the writing style, but the character development of Sophie is flat. The first chapter involves the family's attendance at a bat mitzvah, and it slightly ties in with the second chapter, involving Sophie's stint at Hebrew school. By the third chapter, Sophie is in college but as written, the story could be about a completely different character. There is no thread of continuity from the first two chapters to the third, and I found Sophie neither a sympathetic nor a compelling subject.I am hopeful that Melissa Bank recaptures the magic of ""Girl's Guide"" in her next work."
3,"It's About to Start, Oh Yes, It's Started","This book which I just finished, The Wonder Spot is like the thought that interrupts the point you are trying to make and then never get back to completing. No one notices you didn't complete the thought but there is a general feeling of irritation. At the start, I liked it because she was young and this writing about nothing big but a lot of little things worked because she was young. As the protagonist got older, the guise worked less. She'd be going strong in a relationship in one chapter and then inexplicably be with a whole other dude in the next. It wasn't confusing it was just a little weird. It was definetly readable but for the right person I guess. Then it just ... ended. I didn't love it at all."
3,A so-so read,"Wonder Spot was the first book I read by Melissa Bank. The story follows Sophie Applebaum and her search for her own identity. I found the book to be a very uneven read. When you first meet Sophie, the author allows you inside her head and you learn about her, her life, her place in it. As she starts developing relationships the focus switches to each new one.Through Sophie's journey, I found myself feeling sorry for her. She seemed unable to commit to anyone or anything. She wasn't weak, but she certainly seemed to not develop an identity of her own.I found myself wanting to shake Sophie and yell ""Make a decision, make a choice!"" I thought Banks did describe the Jewish culture well and the book was a step above some of the poorly written chick lit, but I'm thinking I won't be reading another one by the author as my psyche can't take the whining the protagonist did!"
2,not worth any time,The book is nothing more than short stories centering around Sophie Applebaum. There is no ending. The characters' lives are never resolved. There are large gaps of her life missing between the stories. Some of the things in the stories make absolutely no sense. I'm very sorry I wasted 2 days reading it and trying to understand it.
4,uncomfortable spot,"Oh, so this is what a modern relationship is then!?!A strange girl grows into a benign young woman. The best part was that she finally grew up- she was in great need of maturity and character. Whew! I really wanted to kick Sophie's behind.Melissa Bank makes me laugh out loud."
2,Save your money!,"Put me in the ranks of those who read and very much enjoyed ""The Girls Guide to Hunting & Fishing"". However, this book makes me wonder whether my opinion of the first book was accurate. (I had a similar experience with Frank McCourt's books). While the interconnection between stories and characters was clear and flowed smoothly in the first book, the style of this one is just a mess. Characters disappeared without explanation. The main character rambles on in a self-absorbed and unsympathetic manner. In any case, if you haven't read either of her books, I'd certainly recommend ""The Girl's Guide..."" over this!"
2,Another over-hyped book,"This author must have very close friends or relatives in the publishing business. Her first book was nothing special, for all the hoopla, and this book is just as disappointing.To be completely fair, it started out somewhat promising but quickly dissolved into another ordinary/boring tale of an ordinary/boring slacker. Sophie Applebaum has nothing special to tell and nothing interesting to say. She is just another twenty-something with very low self-esteem.Don't waste your time or money. Either take it out of the library or look for it in the discount book section, where I am sure it will turn up very soon."
3,Disappointing,"I was sort of relieved to discover that I wasn't the only one who didn't love this book. I did love ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" and so I expected to feel the same about this one, but I just didn't. The story is very similar to Girls' Guide, but without the plucky, quirky, insightful main character. Unlike Jane in Girls' Guide, the main character in The Wonder Spot (Sophie) is a lackadaisical, bland follower. I found myself getting irritated with her and her lack of work ethic (after the umpteenth time she is late to work because she overslept, I wanted to scream ""get an alarm clock!"") and her passive, acquiescent attitude toward her selfish, controlling poet boyfriend.To be honest, I could not finish this book. I have too many books and too little time to struggle through a story I am not enjoying. I think Melissa Bank is a brilliant writer who just took a misstep with this novel. I hope her next one is better."
2,What happened?,"Where is the author of A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing? That was a page turning laugh out loud read. I read it twice. I plodded through The Wonder Spot hoping it would get better and the real writing of Melissa Bank would emerge. Her main character, Sophie, is a loser. She is not just a loser, she is a bore, who is rude; although she thinks she is being witty. Sophie is the person you meet and can't wait to get away from because you are afraid her negativity will rub off if she shakes your hand. She falls into jobs. She falls into relationships. She falls. And takes the reader down with her. I was disappointed."
3,A Coming of Age Tale...,"Melissa Bank really knows how to develop a character. This story was told with humor and often affection for the book's heroine - Sophie. The reader is able to follow her through the ups and downs in her life, which makes the story believable and relatable. As Sophie searches for her identity, I found myself searching for mine and it's enjoyable to find myself in a character. However, the book is not a page turner. The momentum shifts many times throughout the book which prompted me to finish it, but it definitely moves at slow pace at times."
5,Bank deepens and broadens her range.,"Melissa Bank's second book-a novel, a book of linked stories-may disappoint some fans of A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing, but as a writer she has gone far deeper in her new book, The Wonder Spot. The wit is still there, the graceful prose, the deep empathy one feels for the main character, Sophie Applebaum. But in The Wonder Spot Bank shows new depths and nuances and shadows. She doesn't hide from sadness or loneliness or failure with her lightning wit-and her canvas in The Wonder Spot is broader. She deals with death and religion; with issues of class and money; with even deeper themes of identity and appearance in conflict with character and integrity that is nearly Jamesian. She is strong and smart and funny, but she is also no longer afraid to be vulnerable. Second books-especially after huge first successes-are tough, but Melissa Bank has far exceeded even our most generous expectations. She has written an important and brilliant new book."
3,Better than no Sabicas at all,"This is one of the few available DVDs of Sabicas. Unfortunately it is a disappointment -- a cheap and inadequate production. Nevertheless, it is indispensable for lovers of Sabicas' art, which so far exceeds in technical virtuosity and impeccable musical taste that of any other flamenco guitarist. How sad that no one took the trouble to produce a comprehensive and professional film of Sabicas' playing before he died. Fortunately, there are great audio albums of Sabicas available, such as Leyenda del Siglo XX. Watch out, however. This album plays a trick on the listener: the first ten tracks show Sabicas at his finest and the sound quality is excellent; some idiot then tacked on seven additional sub-standard duet tracks obviously recorded at some other time and in some other place, and these tracks are unfortunately far below the quality of the core ten tracks."
4,Toilet Paper Tigers,"If you love baseball, or if you love to laugh, this is a great book for you. Gordon Korman's ""Toilet Paper Tigers"" is a great book. In the book a boy named Corey Johnson experiences what it's like to have a scientist for a coach, the coach's bossy granddaughter for assistant coach, a team full of bad baseball players, and a uniform with toilet paper on it.As the season goes on, Kristy (the bossy granddaughter) finds a way to make every person a good player and gradually, the Tigers realize that if they try hard enough they can form a good team.This book teaches a great lesson. The lesson is that it doesn't matter how bad you are at something, if you reach deep inside of yourself, you can find something that makes you a valuable team player."
5,Best Grinder Ever,"It's not just a better coffee grinder, it's a better life! My Cuisinart DCG-20BK Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder is a symbol for my kitchen counter that says, ""I'm better than you, and I know it!"" When the ladies come over, they see that sleek stylish appliance sitting on my counter. With a quick glance they know that I have the tools to fill them up with a hot cup of coffee. After the anticipation has grown to it's maximum, I'll show them how I work it."
1,Get a real grinder,"The blade broke after 14 months of use. And to take advantage of the warranty, I learned that I was required to send THEM a check for $4.00 for processing costs, not to mention the cost that I would incurr to ship it to them. It was an adequate grinder at best, so I'm definitely not going to bother returning it (I assume that this is Cuisinart's reason for having such a lame warranty in the first place). I wonder if the rest of their product line is like this. Until now, I thought Cuisinart was a name you could trust. I'm very disappointed."
2,SKIP THIS PRODUCT,1 PIECE UNIT. AFER GRINDING MUST TIP WHOLE UNIT TO EMPTY. CHEAPER IS NEVER BETTER. LOOKING TO REPLACE AFTER FIRST USE.
1,Maybe a lemon????,"Grinder barely worked out of the package. Blade seemed to either slip on the shaft, or the motor stalled. Not sure which. Amazon took it back no questions. Still using our old Krups, and it hasn't died yet. When it does I won't be bying this unit for a replacement. Probably just a bad unit, as we've had very good service from everything we've bought through Amazon. The next on they ship (to someone else) will probably work fine..."
1,"Cheap, No Parts Available","Bought this for our son going to college. Within a year the plastic tabs on the lid broke off. They are required to operate the grinder. So, we go to order a new lid...guess what....they don't sell ANY parts for this grinder.I have a different brand that doesn't use the plastic tabs and it has been working for 15 years. AVOID THIS ONE!CC"
1,It broke the second day - and it wasn't big enough,"Motor quit the second day! I am not kidding. And as others said, it really wasn't big enough. If you got your 12 cups worth you had to remove the lid over another container because the grounds will spill out. Finally, it is poorly designed with an extra wall in the lid - the only function of which is to capture grounds and beans so you can have trouble cleaning it.I'm a fool. After buying their combo grinder/maker for our new second home, I gave up cleaning that joke every day and got the seperate maker and grinder of the same brand.I'm a fool, don't be like me. Buy performance, not looks. Back to Krups."
5,Works fast!,This is a replacement for a coffee grinder we've had for more than 2-years. The motor takes less time to grind beans to medium - fine.
5,Cuisinart coffee grinder,"Best coffee grinder for the money. Do not buy the Mr. Coffee, it is not nearly as well made for the same money."
5,Cuisenart coffee grinder,A very sturdy and simple to operate product.Cuisinart DCG-12BC Grind Central Coffee Grinder
2,Didn't care for the taste.,I enjoy the Red Mill products. I tried the Honey Almond granola for the first time. It tasted as though it was old. I sampled all four bags and the taste was consistent. It's hard to review a product you didn't care for because the next person may have a different opinion. I must say I didn't care for it and pitched it.
2,Dry and tasteless,"This product was a distinct disappointment. It had no flavor, no almonds that I could find, nothing to recommend it. It reminded me of what we feed our horses."
3,OK read,"I happen to love how Beverly Lewis writes. I can go through one of her books in two days. This book however just didn't cut it for me. I found myself more interested in what was going on with Lou and Esther than I did with Annie. As a matter of fact, I felt Annie was more warm and personable in the first book. With all of that said it is still a good read."
1,Not an accurate portrayal of the Christian Faith,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is not genuine Christian fiction. I read the Preacher's Daughter first and then The Englisher and I found them to not be an accurate view of the Christian faith. The books (and the Amish faith) portray a legalistic religion, put their authority as supreme rather than a direct relationship with God, and don't allow people to say they have been saved through a personal relationship with God. This thinking is contrary to what the Bible teaches. The book also leaves you hanging. There is no good closure to the book and it does not stand alone as a book. I would not want people to buy this book thinking this is what it is to be a Christian. A relationship with God is personal and brings freedom not legalism."
5,Asus A8V-SE motherboard,Delivered quickly from vendor in NYC. Works fine. Asus makes a good product.
2,Ours just broke,"This toaster was an underperforming, overpriced toaster and to top it all off, one of the two heating elements just broke. I do not think I will replace it with another Cuisinart."
2,Just Doesn't Last!!,"Heed the warnings given, this toater has a short life!! We have had it less than 8 months and the heating element on one side is gone."
1,"horrible,horrible,horrible..............","This cd SUCKS. I don't know what else to say. DO NOT waste your money. As a lifelong Beatles fan, and somebody who has just about every possible tribute cd to the Beatles-which numbers about 150 or so, this by far was the worst. William Shatner sounded better on his tribute album. OK, maybe I'm exagerating a little. Three or Four of the songs were OK (Drive My Car was probably the best and it was mediocre.) Save your money and buy a remastered Lennon cd or something."
1,The Un-Universal Remote Control,"The RCA RCU800 Universal remote control was a very big disappointment. It did not work with my Philips Satellite Receiver even through my model is listed as supported and has a code number. My Sanyo DVD player was not supported at all. The only thing which did work was my GE television which was one of the defaults. Technical support for this product was a joke and it was impossible to reach a live technician. Frankly the printed user manual was easier and faster to use then telephone support. It is also impossible to make a pre-sale determination as to which products are supported, not that you can believe the manual. Save the time and aggravation and do not purchase this product. I wish I could recommend an affordable alternative but I have not found one.Mike"
4,product was as described,The disc arrived promptly and was as had been described. i Would consider other order in the future if needed.
1,Info Needed,I purchased thinking it would work with my Cuisinart food processor. It didn't. Cuisinart - for reasons unfathamable - has different sizes of cutters. Their shapes are the same. The difference is one is slightly smaller than the other. Until you try to attach the blade to the stem you wouldn't know they will not fit.Better info could have saved me both time and money - shipping and handling.
3,"Boring, but informative","Although I had to have my husband stab me every few minutes to keep me awake, this book helped me get an A in my class. The book is for the most part easy to understand, but some of the exercise questions were somewhat confusing. An answer sheet for the ""Check Your Understanding"" sections would've been extremely helpful to let you know if you were getting the meaning of the chapter. Like I said...stay awake & you'll do fine."
1,Didn't Work Right Out of the Box,"Followed all the instructions right out of the box. The result was an error code (DREGDRAW MISS). Customer service was helpful... so helpful in fact I could tell I wasn't the first person with this problem. They emailed me info to remove the brew unit using a screwdriver to over-ride the program that was locking it in place. Still no luck. Then they thought maybe it was one of the three pressure switches. In the end they offered to have it shipped back for repairs. I delcined and returned it to where I bought it. I'm sure the thing works great, but you had better be prepared for breakdowns and have a plan to deal with them."
1,"Dreadful, bitter, jaded, vicious, and DULL","""Agatha Raisin and the Curious Curate"" is unreadable. Every single character is vilely, vilely unsympathetic. I simply could not make myself care about this pack of shrews, snobs, bigots, and jerks. By page 50 I was hoping that the murderer was armed with a suitcase nuke. By page 60 I was so bored with the bitter harpy main character that I gave up.The stereotypes in this book are so broad (and so unrealistically awful) that I wonder if the writer was intending satire. If so, it doesn't work any better as a satire than it does as a mystery. Awful, dreadful book, and I cannot recommend it."
2,Very disappointing,"I've read every Agatha Raisin book, most of them twice, and I must say this one was the most disappointing. This series started out so strong; I used to laugh out loud, and looked forward to the release of the next book. The plots were never mundane, and the books were filled with imagination and character. But gradually this series has become less and less enjoyable for me. I certainly won't rush to buy the next one. Thankfully, the Hamish Macbeth series is still going strong. Reading this book and the latest Hamish Macbeth book in sucession, it was difficult to believe they were from the same author; the Agatha Raisin book was run of the mill, the Hamish Macbeth book was as engaging as ever."
1,I don't know why I read these books,"I've read all the Agatha's and still find her a bad car wreck. I just can't tear my eyes away and I'm always mad at myself for reading them. She's totally unlovable, vain, stupid and locked in the stupid ""gotta have a man"" mindset. Put her on Prozac and maybe she'll become more interesting. I'd rather hear from Mrs. Bloxby."
1,Tell the truth!!!,"If you buy and read Jaid Black for erotica, you will love this book. I bought if for Romantic Suspense. Which it is to a certain extent. But Get REAL!! This is an attempt to mainstream a type of erotic novel better left off the suspense shelf.The first few pages were GREAT!! I thought o'boy, this will be good. The premise is GREAT! I loved the thought of people who are lonely looking for love on the internet. It is real, it happens. BUT, looking for someone to dominate you or force your submission, is kinky. With all the abuse in the world, Who would be foolish enough to let someone you haven't ever seen do those kind of things to you.As a doctor, she has seen alot. Surely she has some kind of sense of self preservation.This is erotica. Good for eroticia, not good as romantic (what's romantic about bondage and submission?) suspense."
4,Acts by Woiwode,"I bought it used, arrived in fine condition. Very easy to read and interesting. Valuable perspectives on a wide variety of topics from an experienced writer. I appreciated the Christian viewpoint."
2,Doesn't toast the tops,"The toasting slots are too shallow. When I use normal, presliced bread, the top half-inch of my toast doesn't get toasted at all."
2,Burns Everything,"Don't get it. Don't get the other reviews. No matter how or, what you put in the toaster, it burns one side. Toast: Burns one side. Bagel: burns one side. Bun: Burns one side, And I mean BLACK. Tried all the different settings. Read the instructions, etc. Still burns one side. Black. My old toaster works fine, but its 25 years old. Not worth the price. Not worth, buying. at any price."
2,Not what it used to be,"I had what was supposed to be the same model for many years and it worked very well, although the push-down handle broke off two years ago. The toaster finally became stuck in reheat mode, so I decided to replace it with the same model. Not possible. The newer incarnation of the Classic is much less sturdy and the push-down mechanism would not engage - that is, you could not push the handle down and have it stay down to toast. I returned it and set out to find a better toaster - no easy task."
2,"If you like burnt toast, this is for you","Personally, I don't like burnt toast and hate this toaster. I thought buying a Cuisinart toaster would insure a lasting appliance. I may as well have spent $10 at a discout store. I have had this toaster for a bit over 3 years. We don't toast often, but for the last year I have been tolerant of popping up the toast half-way through to see if it is ready as if I wait for the machine despite any setting it will burn. Very disappointing for an appliance that is supposed to have a good reputation. Two starts as it did work fine for 2 years."
5,An amazingly comprehensive and detailed guide,"The author (a diver/photographer/biologist living in Guam) has scoured the scientific literature and distilled the essential facts about each species into this amazingly comprehensive guide. Color plates, drawings, tables and a concise paragraph describing each fish and its behavior make it an essential reference for divers and scientists almost anywhere in the tropical Indo-Pacific, not only Micronesia. The care and love of detail that have gone into this work are unsurpassed. The only work comparing with it in scope is the massive Smith's Sea Fishes (limited to the fishes of South Africa). Of the two, this may be the better if only because of its handy size and copious underwater photographs."
5,DragonLance and Raistlin are Golden,"I could never tire of Dragonlance and this is probably my sixth or seventh copy of the book. Not to mention all of the other books in the series. If you want to fall in love with a bad guy and cling to the edge of your seat to see if he ever reaches redeamtion, this is for you! And of course there are hundreds of battles with all sorts of creatures from the world of Krynn...and let's not forget the dragons! If I could give more than five stars, I would."
4,A Classic,An easy read but still great after all these years. I thought I remembered these books but not even close
2,HELP!!!,"PLEASE! I read this book in hopes it would be as good as the Chronicles. I was wrong. The plot is good but thats the worst part, you need to pay a lot of attention, so you may have to read back a bit. I have read worse but I haven't and won't recommend it to anyone. I guess you could say if you are obsessed with Dragonlance, take a while and read it, if you aren't, do yourself a favor and stop after the Chronicles."
3,Rather Dissapointing,"I thought Time of the Twins was a big dissapointment after reading the Chronicles trilogy. Weis & Hickman totally changed their style of writing (for the worse I'd say). It was very depressing and lacked the action, adventure, and magic of the first trilogy. I do think it is necessary as a loyal DragonLance fan to read it, though. The Legends trilogy does get better, but it takes a while (a real long while)"
4,Better than Chronicles,"This is an excellent series, and was definitely better than the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy for the simple reason that there are fewer characters to keep track of. The only portions that I didn't like was the transition from the beginning to the middle of the story, when Caramon suddenly transforms into a warrior again from a drunkard by becoming a gladiator, and when Caramon and Raistlin become the leaders of Fistandantilus's army. Too much time passes in both of these instances without any explanation, especially with the Army of Fistandantilus, and even though I knew that Caramon commanded a great army, it just didn't feel like there's anyone else there but Caramon, Raistlin, and Crysania.The last Legends book is the best, and has one of the best endings I've ever seen. But before even starting this series, read through Chronicles first, or at least the first Chronicles book, because otherwise you won't give a d@mn about the characters in this trilogy."
4,motorola sd4591 digital corded/cordless answering machine,cannot hear the messages very well on the answering machine
1,Poor Phone Product,"Piece of junk. I purchased the phone system in May 2007 and returned it to Amazon in August 2007 for an 80% refund. The answering system never worked well. Messages were frequently garbled and unintelligible. I called Motorola and they sent reset instructions through email, which did nothing to correct the garbled messages. I then requested an RMA from Motorola. They denied the RMA even though I was within the warantee period. I appears Amazon as reseller holds the ownership of the warantee. I then called Amazon who offered an exchange, but I refused. Instead Amazon offered to refund the price the phone system prorata."
1,Don't get it,"This is not a good product. The instructions are confusing and setting the menus is clumsy. The address book has to be entered in the cordless phone, not the base set, for both phones. (There's a very confusing distinction between private numbers and shared numbers). The date/time stamp simply doesn't work at all and it is impossible to fix. The cordless phone went on the blink just weeks after I set it up, and it didn't come back till I let the battery run out. The message system is very annoying. Each time you listen to a new message (which of course doesn't have the right date/time) the machine plays all of the old ones, whether you want to hear them or not. It's a total loss and I'm going to buy a replacement."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Don't waste your money on these. I prefer the Lansinoh Storage Bags.Cons: do not have a double zipper, so they tend to leakthey do not hold as much milk as the other brandthey do not freeze as flat as the other brand because there is not extra room at the top to squeeze out the airmore expensivePro: they attach directly to your pump, however I don't think it is very hard to pour the milk from bottles into the other brand's bags."
2,I couldn't get my foot in it.,The Plantar Facitis Night Splint did not fit. It was size Large but the leg calf area was made so narrow there was no way to get my leg into it. Plus it upper velcro strap was at least 3 inches too short.
3,Night Splint,"It was kind of hard to get used to it, since I roll all night long. Also, I had to have some help to strap the strap by the toes. Perfect angle for the healing process, comfortable to wear and reasonable price."
4,Good One!!,"I purchased this player recently from amazon.com.This is working good until now no probs.Wish sony had madea cordless remote instead of corded one...which makes u feeltoo many wires!!The velcro that is given to stick the unit is not great..The cd player keeps falling!! This is a minor issue about thethe product, we can use another thing to stick it..On the whole good one!!!"
5,"courageous, singular book","as has been stated, this is a collection of surreptitious portraits, purely candid close-up photographs of subway riders in the paris metro (where it is illegal to photograph, incidentally) and it is by a photographer who should be known by any student or fan of comtemporary photography."
3,Highway to Heaven,Highway to Heaven was o.k. to watch. Not nearly as good as Little House. I was looking for a show that reflected Christian values. I just did not like the episodes that much.
1,Too much swearing and No Closed Captioning!,"If you own a TV Guardian that mutes the bad words, forget it working with Seasons 1 and 2 of Highway To Heaven. The Guardian needs Closed Captioning to work. Some episodes don't hevs swearing but that is not the norm. I gave 1 star because of No CC and edited Episodes and Swearing.And too expensive not to have Closed Captioning.What a pity."
4,Great family entertainment,My wife and I think this is a great series for all age groups sending the right messages out
5,No problem at all,"Installed quickly and easily. Hope never to have to test the ""Floodsafe"" feature but nice to have it there..."
4,Good price for good supplement,I use Curcumin as part of my daily supplementation due to its anti-inflammatory properties. This is one of the best prices I've found.
2,Curcumin not good for everyone,"I read somewhere that this product would be good for what ails you. However, it was not good for me. My system didn't like whatever's in it, and I got sick. Nothing against the product, it was just me."
4,High quality,"These are a high quality, and since I believe this is something I should be taking, I'm happy with Amazon's offering of this product with 700 mg dosage."
3,Great coffee maker while it lasts,"Have to agree with other reviewers here: The Cuisinart DCC-100 is a terrific no frills coffeemaker that is perfect for those who don't want digital clocks, timers, lights, grinders, etc. The problem is that Cuisinart chose to spech the parts to the very low-end - so the unit will not last forever. Based on my own experience of everyday use and the experience of others posting here, I would guess that 3 years is about what you should expect for reasonably safe use. After that, there is a real risk of over-heating and possibly fire. At a minimum you can expect one of the components to fail - even if it's just a connection. It's a shame, too, becuase this is a coffeemaker that you really want to just keep using."
2,Leaks out the bottom after 3 years,"The unit started to leak out the bottom after 3 years. I called Cuisinart and they said they had not heard of this problem before, though I see others have reported the same problem here."
2,Disappointed...,"This is my second ""Cuisinart DCC-100"". The first one was a great product, which I had it for over 3 years.So when I broke the carafe, instead of buying a replacement carafe, I purchased the entire coffee makerAll good so far, however, as I started to use the coffee maker, the white plastic container (where the black plastic coffee filter goes in to) deformed due to the hot steam. Now, there is a big gap between the cover and the container, and steam escapes when I make coffee.Good thing I didn't throw away the old unit. I just use the old unit with the new carafe.I guess the old saying is true: ""They don't make it like they used to""."
3,You need an adapter for these discs.,"The blades on these discs are heavy, sharp and well made. But you need a detachable stem accessory to use them for my food processor (a DC-5 series). The stem did not come with the discs or the processor, is not currently available from Amazon. I finally found it at the Cuisinart website."
4,"Good product, poor documentation","Discs are very good, excellent quality. However, you do need to know how to use them, as the documentation with them is poor."
2,Two stars for two great songs,"She's a fine pianist and at times compelling composer, but the overproduction and overall pretentiousness is too much. On the plus-side, we have a true stylist in the sonic tradition of Joni Mitchell (to a degree) and Annie Haslam [Renaissance] to a greater degree.The writing is subtle, though, as mundane, everyday objects, take on multi-layers of meaning - sofas, phones, cigarettes. Still, those over-arrangements weigh down any buoyancy.Back to my review title: ""Beautiful Invisible"" is a phenomenal success, transcending comparison with the above-named/or any other artists, and the Bonus Track, ""Jigsaw"" has the straight-ahead, rocking thing going that just about all the tracks should have had.Pete Townshend on acoustic guitar (?) - how about a partial album re-do with Pete on acoustic guitar and Rachel on acoustic keyboard - and up-front vocals on all the tracks.(Maybe same the instrumental ""Lament"" for the CD-single B-side. Nice work, though, Jonathan Williams)."
3,Disappointing,"I must be listening to a different CD to some of these other reviewers? Rachel Fuller is clearly a talented musician but her strengths seems to lie in arranging and orchestration rather than as a composer and artist. The songs are listenable, but not particularly memorable. The vocals are competent but not special and the whole album drifts along in a pleasant, but not very interesting way. More background music to a dinner party than something which commands your attention. I'm not sure that the Tori Amos/ Alanis Morisette comparisons are fair, as both artists have much more of an edge. Think Dido in uninspired mood and I think that you would be nearer the mark. Overall a disappointing album, given the money that has clearly been thrown at the production. If there is a second album I hope that it is stronger."
3,A Mormon Midrash,"An easy to read story. Don't expect it to be quite Biblical, as it certainly has a generous smattering of Mormon theology thrown in. ""Abraham even knows the name of the star where God lives"". Give me a break! As if the Hebrew God can be bound by space! If you can get past those little subterfuges, it's a pleasant read."
1,Don't waste your time,"I loved the Ender books by this author so I thought I'd branch out of the SciFi realm and read something else he wrote. Wow...this book was crap. If you're going to write a novel based on just a few parts of the Bible, at least work on some character development, make it interesting. I felt like I was in Sunday School, being punished for missing confession and my punishment was this book.The worst part is that sweet, intelligent, eager to help Rebekah turns into this simpering, over-sexed old woman (while still a teenager mind you) as soon as she meets her husband-to-be.Save your time and your money."
4,"Great product, but not a gel",This product really works. It brightens skin and seems to lessen wrinkles. It also seems to smooth skin. I do not know why they call it a gel. It's most definitely a liquid. Its only drawback is that it seems to bad after awhile. You only need a tiny amount for eyes. But after about a month or so it gets dark and seems to dry up or something. It's still worth buying though.
4,Easy to use.,I thought there would be 50 spaces for the state quarters but there are 100. I was not aware that each quarter is made in two locations. Now I have to start looking for 50 more quarters!
1,Danger! Kettle Has Hazard!,"I have owned several of these, and both have broken - The handleweld comes undone and can dump the boiling water on you, your baby, or your pet.To make matters worse, the Cuisinart company was sold a few years to an absentee-Chinese shlock manufacturer who are driving the brand into the ground. All my multiple emails and calls to the company were ignored.If you can live with this defect (I am rather immune, since I am a chemist/bachelor - but I still dont like the fact my kettle has no handle!), then go for it. But watch out below!"
2,Great while it lasted -- but short life expectancy.,"Am sorry to say after less than a year - this product began to have trouble staying 'on'. The contact on the bottom of the kettle starts to wear out. Too bad, we really enjoyed it. Cuisinart hasn't fixed a problem that's been documented by other reviewers.I won't replace it with another KUA-17. no more Cuisinart products for me."
2,"Great, but short life","I owned this kettle, not only did look amazing on the counter it worked really well, although it lasted less than a year. I loved it for the short time it worked, but would not recommend it."
3,Breaks too easily,I have had 2 cuisinart water kettles. My latest one simply died after 4 years of use. The one prior to that had the handle fall off after 2 years of use. My mother's same kettle also died after less than 1 year of use. Be careful. This product seems to have durability issues.
3,Great while it lasts,"I'm just going on to order another one after our first wore out after a few years. As another reviewer said, they should last longer. So, not best value for the money, but after checking out many different options, still our favorite."
2,Horrible ringtones/Bad handset shape,"This phone had 2 flaws that caused us to return it. The ringtones are awful sounding, anything other than the default ringtone is unusable because the sound seems muffled and just sounds bad. We could not stand to hear it ring. Also the handset will not stand up on its own so the handset speakerphone is essentially useless. The handset speakephone volume is also too low at even the highest setting. Pass on this one."
2,very dated,"If you like Nantucket style, the way it used to be, without modern twists, you will like this. It was such a cliche in my opinion. I thought the style was more classic but now realize, it too can become dated."
1,Highly disappointing,"It's 2005 repackaged, the new features like QB vision actually make it harder without adding anything to the game, and the Superstar mode is entirely random.Add in that the price soared back to $50, and the only reason this is selling is that it's the only NFL game with updated rosters (exclusive license)."
5,Football players rejoice,"All right, first of all this game is absolutlely incredible. I am not just saying that because I am a football player but this game is just about everything that sports videogame players will just love. I am a little disappointed with the graphics though. But once you get past that the gameplay is very fair. The collisions are not that great. If you look at the replays they are pretty lame how it looks like you go right through the other players. The controls are solid, the gameplay is unique with the new Superstar mode. That is the funnest thing EA has ever put in one of their football games. You get to choose your parents and choose DNA. But if you played the NCAA Football '06 game and beat it, then you don't get to choose your parents, DNA, or how your body is built. You get drafted and you start your life as a football star. This game is great for fans of Madden."
4,Above Average,"I've enjoyed Madden since the days of Super Nintendo....This yeasr madden was good but not great...the precision passing, does take some time to get used to, but it fits into my ""spread em"" type offense quite well....One major negative I have about this game is that, in dynasty mode, it seems as if every player's rating goes up. Whether the athlete sits the bench or not they go up. As you can expect, this causes major cap problems. Further, any guy who you do play (especially a Safety) goes up. Therefore, if you draft a Strong Safety in the 7th round, give him 3 years and he will be a 90. At one point, about 15 years into my franchise. There was only 1 QB ( the one on my team) in the 90s, whereas EVERY strong and free safety was at least a 92 rating. Despite this negative I still play the game constantly because it is quite addicting."
4,Best Christmas Gift of 2000!,"This is best gift I received this Christmas. The user's guide is clear and easy to understand. The machine is also very easy to program and the guide gives many helpful hints and tips. The clean-up is a bit more than with traditional brew-only machines but using a paper filter facilitates the process. The coffee is smooth and mellow. I enjoy coffee with Half & Half, and it is nice to be able to adjust the holding temperature so that I can still have a HOT cup of coffee. I highly recommend this machine. I didn't give it 5 stars due to the extra time cleaning and set-up requires...but that is only a minor drawback."
2,Much more work than separate grinder and coffeemaker,"I purchased this coffeemaker to replace my grinder and coffeemaker, and am considering giving it away and going back to my old 2 machine setup. There are 3 parts that have to be removed, washed and dried after each use, so I'm not saving any time or steps from using 2 machines.Further, I prefer a strong brew, and if I want to make a full pot, not all the beans will fit in the grinder at once. I have to run it twice. What a pain. I resent this machine and wish it would ""accidently"" fall off the counter so I could justify throwing out a costly appliance.By the way, I don't think the coffee is as good or as hot as it was with my old Krups. If you love coffee, you probably don't want this machine."
2,No 5 stars from me!,"While I was initially thrilled with this awesome looking machine, I was soon disappointed. I opened the box to find a piece broken, which they replaced but soon found that my initial disappointment was true to the whole machine. I found it very messy to clean up, and clean you must (the whole machine) after every pot or mold soon appears in many of the nooks & crannies, which are difficult to clean. The flavor select nob, in my opinion, does nothing! The pot itself never stayed sufficiently hot, even at the highest setting and eventually the clock stopped functioning properly. Soon after(about 3 days)the entire machine stopped working. Well, i returned it and just ordered the Capresso....we'll see?"
1,Who Designed this Mess?,"This is the absolute hardest coffee maker to clean ever made. It is impossible to clean. Even though it worked, I threw it away as I could not get it clean. It clogs very easily!!!"
5,Best Home Brewed Coffee ever,"This coffee maker makes great coffee, freshly ground without the hassle of a separate coffee grinder. The inside of the unit tends to get grounds here and there--but so does a coffee grinder and it doesn't affect the coffee. As to cleaning the pot between brewing cycles, who doesn't clean a coffee pot between uses? yech!! I immediately bought one for my oldest son for his birthday--and then went ahead and bought two more--for my middle son and my daughter. They all love it. One caveat--they all say they are drinking more coffee (and two who didn't care for coffee have started the habit). So depending on what theory you follow--it's either a very good habit or a very bad habit.I broke one part (by dropping it) and they sent me a replacement part--quickly--with no charge."
4,4 stars for the 1st year,"I've now had 2 of these Cuisinart coffee maker/ grinders. I asked for both as gifts. They both worked great for the 1st year. There are several parts to clean, beans can fall down into the water tank, the grinder shaft motor only lasts about 2 years, then tends to go KAPUT, and I only make a pot every 2-3 days! Accidently dropped the filter top in the sink, and the inner rim piece broke loose (this happened on both units) Super-glued the two pieces together, with mixed results. One I have now, that rim cracked loose, the grinder died, and recently, the top latch no longer latches, one side of the flimsy little thing cracked. Ok, so now, I'm grinding whole bean coffee with my 25 yr old KRUPS grinder, putting it in this coffee maker set to brew only, not to grind. AND, I now have to use some masking tape on the lid to keep it closed, or the damn thing won't work at all. I'm looking for something else next time around."
1,Too much time and trouble,"I bought the grind and brew as a gift for my in-laws and regretted it almost immediately. In order for the coffee maker to work you have to pull it apart, rinse it and dry it completely before each use. It's time consuming and difficult. Who wants to work that hard for a decent cup of coffee? This year we're buying them a Melitta."
2,A REAL GRIND......,"Yes, this unit is a pain to clean - but not impossible. After a while I was literally cleaning it in my sleep. But when I had guests over they were baffled as to how to get at all the parts and subsequently caused a few overflows. Yes, it makes good coffee....but...I like my coffee strong and it can only make a maximum of 6 strong cups at a time. Worst of all - I went through 2 of these units in 4 years - the motors just burned out. Do yourself a favor and get the Melitta MEMB1B if you want quality, fresh ground coffee from a unit that is quieter, faster, easier to clean, lasts longer and costs less than the Cuisinart."
2,Such a pain to clean!,"I agree with what most of the other reviewers have said except that it's not so much that cleaning it is such a pain, it's that all those parts you have cleaned need to be COMPLETELY dry to use, otherwise all that freshly ground coffee sticks to everything with so much as a drop of water on it, making the next cleanup even worse and making an awful weak pot of coffee. We have also had our curafe lose parts causing the pause and pour feature to retain water (making a horrible mess) unless the pot is put completely 90 degrees to either side. Would not reccomend and will not replace with another cuisinart. Looking for replacement now. Now where did I put that grinder..."
2,Poor Design,"After using it for two weeks, we returned it. The outer design is excellent,very stylish, and it has a small footprint for the counter. No need to have a separate grinder and canister on the counter. That's the good news. However, having the coffee grinder inside the machine, causes condensation to buildup in the grinder after each use which results in a very high maintenence clean-up effort every time. The grinder assemply, and the connecting flue to the filter, has to be cleaned and throughly dry before the next use, so the ground coffee will end up in the filter and not stuck to the wet surfaces. It was really a hassle to clean and given the high quality of most Cuisuinart products, and the cost, it was a disappointment. In any event, the vendor took it back without a hassle."
4,coffee freak!,"i have had my grind and brew for 14 months. it produces great coffee, as long as you take the time to work with programming the heat and the quantity dial under the lid. yes, it is a pain to clean, but i feel well worth it. yes, you do have to wash the parts and make sure they are thoroughly dry before re-using the machine, but you get used to that after a few times. it becomes routine. besides having fresh ground coffee, the coffee can be ready the moment your feet hit the floor in the morning! i also like the automatic ""clean"" feature (lites up when it is time to run the vinegar through the machine). the only problem i experienced was the plastic lid snapped off....you can't keep removing that lid to clean the pot or it becomes weak, as mine did."
4,"Mmmmm coffee, Ughhh cleaning","Generally have enjoyed the Grind'n'Brew over the past 5 months. Coffee is good (but not as good as a French press) but it is a pain to clean, you have to clean the grinder lid, grinder/filter base, filter insert, and filter top each time you use the machine. A pain, but not that big a deal once you get used to it."
3,Disc cutter,"Disc cutter works on vegetables well, but I would like to have a larger, possibly an 8by8mm, opening for larger french fries."
3,Nice processor but............,I'm not happy abou the small french fry blade. This is probably my last Cuisinart food processor. It does work great on most foods. Cuts time in half when making salads. But I need more versatility for the price I paid.
5,Love!,I have ordered these chips twice and both times they were delivered in a timely manner and were fresh and delicious. They are salted perfectly and a great substitute for anyone craving salted banana chips. They are more consistently crunchy than many brands of salted banana chips which tend to clump. They really do taste fresh - no rancid oil taste here!
5,Healthy Snack,I keep these around all the time. I eat a paleo diet. This is my potato chip alternative and it satisfies my salty craving. Would definitely recommend.
1,Still waiting for a piece!,"Would be a great system if Aliga Online could actually send me the right part. The original set was missing an extension so I emailed (in November) and finally got a part 3 weeks later, which was the wrong color! Emailed again, again and once again....now it's the end of February and I still don't have the correct part to finish my closet. Not worth the hassle."
5,Satisfied customer,This custom closet kit is absolutely worth the money. Its so sturdy and looks absolutely beautiful. I am so pleased with this purchase. I was able to organize my closet in a way that gives me so much space. I can't believe i didn't get this sooner. I am going to purchase a few more for my other closets in my home. When i look at my closet now i think it looks so great and the price was worth the finished product.
4,Great,Easy to install looks great price.......prime is worth the money. Amazon Prime Has already paid for itself with my last few purchases. Back to this product. We have a small walk in closet that now seems to be twice the size with this product. We love it. It took me about 1 hour to put it up and it took my wife 3 hours to color coordinate all of her cloths!
5,Great value!,"This was really easy to put up, and my only problem was getting the screws into the wall. I should have just used the anchors for all of them. Other than that I spent maybe an hour getting everything set up, and it's so easy to change the layout! It seems sturdy enough to hold all my heavy clothes too.I couldn't find it to this price at any local store, so even with 1 day shipping I saved around $30 buying it here."
1,The tool for the job that doesn't exist!,"Purchased the disc to complete a set for the processor. It is entitled a ""French Fry"" disc. If the product it yields is a French Fry, it is for serving in a doll house. In actuality it is more of a cole slaw making disc at best.It does process food, just not in the size or shape it is billed out to do."
5,"Cuisinart DLC-836 6-by-6mm Fruit, Vegetable and French Fry Disc",Great addition for your 7 or 11 inch Cuisinart Food Processor. French fries are a breeze with this disk.
2,Too small for fries,I wanted to use this to make french fried (actually oven baked) sweet potato fries. They are more like string fries rather than larger fries. I don't think Cuisinart makes a larger blade.
1,Maddening,"A stunningly bad exercise in stupidity. The book was both poorly reasoned and poorly written. The authored failed to support their ""argument"" with even the most rudimentary analysis and quantitative evidence. In addition, they completely failed to place their loose ideas into context and apparently have no understanding of history. To wit: A poll tax on voting? Um, excuse me? Have you no education in the history of voting oppression and the fight for civil rights in history?"
1,Deserves zero star.,"Lorie is a well-known singer in France, and all we can say is that she doesn't deserve her success.Her songs have very stupid lyrics, the music is poor...It's bad, very bad."
5,Great Educational Toy,This toy is wonderful it is fun and educational. If you are falling history this may just be the game for you. It is just like a normal monalpoly whith the added bonus of facts about history go by it today!
3,"Heck, It's Better Than ""Poser Punk""","Most Precious Blood was a band that formed from the ashes from Indecision, a hardcore band of the 90's. Anyways, about the CD, it's decent. The singing on ""Your Picture Hung Itself"" really sucks. Most Precious Blood isn't supposed to be a metalcore band. ""The Great Red Shift"" is really short but really provoking. Even though it's hardcore doesn't mean that it's perfect. No Warning set the example with the mediocre ""Suffer, Survive"" as well. I'd rather you buy ""Nothing In Vain"", but this is decent also."
5,"Rubix Cube - demands technique, memory and speed","This cube is good quality. Being new, it started out to be a little stiff. After few weeks of use, the stiffness is reduced and it is a pleasure to solve."
4,Been wanting another one for SO LONG!,"Hey, if you want a Rubik's cube, then here it is! I haven't had one since I was a kid, and I saw it on sale, and decided I just had to get one for my kids. I can't say any of them were as captivated by it as I was, but that's ok. I'm still very satisfied with the purchase--and maybe it was more for me after all..."
5,Fun Rubik's Cube!,My son and I enjoy this toy. He knows it better than myself. I highly recommend it.
3,"Where is the ""hints"" book","I ordered this for my father and paid more for the one with the ""hints"" book. It did not come with a hints book..... Not worth my time to send back for a replacement."
3,A good toy But Not Durable,"I remember this toy in my youth, so I bought it to reminisce about those years.About the toy itself the color stickers started to come off right of the box (poor Q)."
4,Feel Really Good on a Sore Back,"I have a fair amount of experience with yoga so this dvd is a little elementary. I do, however, have quite a few back problems and when my back is acting up I often don't feel up to a studio class and this provides a perfect substitute. It is definitely not a high budget production, but this is not something that I find to be very important. All I care about is that when I am done with the three simple series, my back feels a lot better!"
2,My wife didnt like them,"They didnt have any stop on them to keep them on, and the chain felt funny to her. They just didnt feel right when she wore them"
1,Terrible! Turns everything into powder or mush,"I really wanted to like this disc. I use grated Parmesan in lots of food and the thick grating disk doesn't do the fine grating I want for that. I was hoping to use it to grate soap for homemade detergent and also ginger, etc. It turned the Parmesan into dust, much like the cheap canned Parmesan, not like the fancy fine grate parmesan I was hoping for. It couldn't grate the soap at all, and the ginger just turned into mush. You'd be better off just using the regular processor blade."
1,Worked for 45 seconds,"Received the product, it worked for 30 seconds, then cut off. Unplugged it, plugged it back in, and nothing. It then finally kicked back on and worked for about 15 seconds before stopping again. Later that day tried it again and it still won't turn on. I called Cuisinart customer service and my options are to send it back to them and pay $10 plus shipping for them to fix it and return it in 4 to 6 weeks. Ridiculous. Any reputable company would send out a replacement immediately and include a pre-paid label to return the defective merchandise. Last Cusinart product I every purchase, they are junk. Years back this may have been a decent quality company but no more."
2,Very loud - food processor,Making hummus with the food processor sent my husband from the kitchen because of the loud noise. When I had finished processing the beans I noticed my ears felt like I had been standing next to the speakers at a rock concert...kind of a blocked feeling. Haven't tried the blender yet...
2,Cuisinart SmartPower Blender,"My cuisinart blender work just ""okay"". The milk shakes are good! Things are difficult to pour out into a glass. It comes out in a big ""glop"" ! My machine really stinks when you use it. (Smells like oil.)"
2,A good blender with breaking parts,"I am very torn over this blender. It really blends beautifully -- smoothies, frozen margaritas, anything really. I use my blender a lot, for some many things. But I'm really fed up with having to buy parts for it. The plastic base where the blades are has cracked twice for me. The blender collar has also cracked. All from simple use. I've had many blenders in my life, but none have cracked and broken with the regularity of this one. Next time I'll search for a better blender, one that blends as wonderfully as this one, but that is sturdier without breaking and cracking so often."
1,not up to working long,"My wife has had this duel for 3 years now. It worked about 3 hours a year, both the blender, and processor. Today she needed to puree. fresh out of the cabinet for this year. and nothing. The gear box would not turn at all. and since it uses weird screws, no way to see whats up. So after less than 10 hours of work. replacement cost $22. to 30 plus shipping. BYE BYE . will never buy another Cuisinart product. also it was made in china,"
1,Very Disappointed,"The problem with this blender is that it just doesn't do what it supposed to do. It fails to draw down the ingredients you are blending so the blades just spin around and stir whatever was in the base over and over again. Every time I blend something I have to push the ingredients down with a spoon (while it is off of course)and blend small sections at a time. Sometimes, playing with the various speeds helps, but the design is sorely lacking. I doubt I will ever buy another Cuisinart product again."
5,Indispensable!,Had one for ten years and had to get the same one when some parts broke after almost every day use. Love it!
2,Attack of the Doilies!!,"Run for your life, some doilies with really funky shapes and colors are attacking! Try as I might I could not get up to the level of terror the author wanted to instill with this particular villain--the mandalas. I found the main character very unlikable so I really didn't care what happened to him. ..."
2,"Ambitious, yes, but ultimately a failure.","Ambitious but ultimately unfulfilling horror novel that attempts to capture Lovecraft's grasp of the horror of the beyond. Laidlaw starts with a good premise - a new-age writer who's really a con artist finds himself toying with something he doesn't understand - and adds some nice plot on top of it, but the book never really coalesces into anything all that satisfying. The three main characters all feel a little flat, and the ""action"" is too far-paced to keep things moving all the time, and just bunched enough to create a strange pace. What's more, it's pretty tough to describe the indescribable, and Laidlaw tries, but never really creates the atmosphere and dread and horror that someone like Lovecraft was so good at. It's not really that Mandala is a bad book, but it's ultimately disappointing, especially given all the hype it received; there's no doubt it's ambitious, but it falls pretty short of achieving the goals it sets for itself."
5,Quintessential Uchronia Novel,"Lest Darkness Fall is an engaging story that takes place in a period and location not usually the focus of alternate history: 6th century Italy. Knowing little about the real history of Italy during this period, I realize I missed some of de Camp's more nuanced references. And I am not a big fan of military history, which works its way into the last chapters of the book. But it was all great fun--and highly recommended."
5,AWESOME,Highly recommended to all juggalos. This features tracks by all of the Psychopathic crew at the time.MCL.Jono
3,Good while they lasted!,Liked them a lot at first. Then one stopped working. Sent them back. Think I would prefer microwaveable ones next time!
1,"Doesn't deserve any stars-Cheaply built, poor relief and PAPER","This globe is a glamorous cardboard ball with a sticker on it. The ""relief"" bumps to signify mountain ranges is actually off register (does not line up) with the map adhered to it. Cheap, horribly built, of no discernable quality.I'm returning it. I've had globes before in my 40 years of life, this is junk."
1,Bad installation instructions - No Sound,"Took me 3 1/2 hours to get software installed (instructions are BAD - had to fiddle around for a LONG time to finally get software installed). Once installed, I copied movies to computer hard drive. Guess what? No sound. Burned to DVD - put in DVD player - NO SOUND. This camera has sorely disappointed. Its virtually useless."
1,Total Piece of Garbage,"I recieved this camcorder with much excitement. Our family was going to tape my 1 year old sons first Christmas. Everything seemed in order. I read and followed the instruction manual. I taped most of our Christmas activities.... then it died. An E:31:00 error appeared on the screen. I worked with Sony support. They said my only option was to format the hard drive resulting in loss of the video. Now we have nothing to show for this special time. I would not recommend this piece of junk to anyone. If you purchase a camcorder to capture special family moments, then this isn't the one for you. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR VIDEO!"
2,Why no firewire?,The lack of a firewire rates this item lower than the cheapest SonyHandyCam. Windows XP Movie Maker automatically looks for a camera connection via firewire. The USB makes editing much more difficult. I am truly dissapointed.
5,Great features!,I've enjoyed learning to use the Sony HDD camcorder. The controls are very intuitive. The video and still image quality is excellent.
3,Amazing Video taking but sucky digital pictures,"I bought this SR 100 two months ago and I have taken many videos of my new born. The video is beyond excellent. I changed the settings to LP because the files are so big. 5 min of recording I get a 1/4 gig file size!!As far as the digital still pictures I was very disappointed. It is a 3.0 MP and I expected to do as good as any 3.0 mp camera especially that it has a special lens. I think it has do to with the type of processing that is not up to speed. From reading the reviews and sony's website, it sounded that the 3.0mp is amazing but to come to find out it sucks. I was hoping this replaced my 4.0 MP c-4000 Olympus but that is not the case. I carry both with me. Anytime I need to take a digital photo, I pull out my c-4000 and anytime I need a video, I pull my SR-100.Sony, Please improve on your still pictures. I was hoping to use only one unit for both my video and still!ThanksFrankHouston TX"
2,looked great when i first got it...,the great look didn't last long. within 2 weeks one of the buckles fell off. (had to fix that) then after getting caught in a rain storm on the motorcycle the studs on it began to rust! then the bag lost its shape and i had to screw a board into the bottom to help maintain its shape. overall not a great bag.
1,Very Bad!,"This book is supposed to be about VoIP. Then why is the whole last 1/3rd of the book on IPv6? It is not mentioned in the title or description, yet it is a significant part of the book. I suspect the author didn't know VoIP very well and had to pad. The VoIP parts just introduce concepts and discuss Cisco command line a little bit, but there aren't enough examples or detail to teach you anything about VoIP. It isn't even very good reference material. I wish I hadn't bought this book!"
4,Love this!,This power yoga class is excellent! It is very similar to a power vinyasa flow yoga class that I usually go to. The only thing that sort of bugs me is his moans throughout the dvd when he gets into a pose he likes....a little funny. However even with the moans this is a very challenging and satisfying power yoga session!
2,disappointing copy quality - content good,"Content was OK but was hard to focus on due to the poor quality of the ""new"" product shipped to me. The DVD looked flawless (no scratches or visible imperfections). When played, there were numerous skips and audio dead spots. During the final relaxation pose, the DVD skipped back into the middle of the routine, jerking me out of my calm state. The cover art mirrored the production quality - the colors didn't line up giving the photos a double-vision quality."
5,T-Tapper forever,"T-TAPP is my daily Physical Therapy.I have a deviation of my lower back, and since I found This workout, I have learned tocontrol pain and discomfort caused by pressure of the sciatic nerve.Primary back Stretch and oil wells are some of movements that help my back the most.Thank you Theresa Tapp."
5,Great program,"Body positioning is challenging with T-Tapp. However, she explains so much about the ""why"" of each move and how it shapes muscle groups. I learned a lot about what to expect from my body shape. And, if you do it, it works."
4,A tasty (if pricey) fruit gummy,"A pleasant, orange flavored gummy candy. Not as artificial as most domestic (US) candies, very bright flavor. Good texture, soft, not sticky (no lost fillings here). A bit pricey for my taste.Well worth a try if you like this kind of candy."
5,Cuisinart Thick Slicing Disc works great!,This item works great. Slices vegetables perfectly! It stores in the case that I ordered as well and the case locks.
4,Cusinart thick slicing blade - 6mm,"Just received the Cusinart 6mm slicing blade for use in 7 and 11 cup food processor. The item arrived much earlier than expected - by 2 months!! It was packaged securely. I haven't had a chance to use the slicing blade at this time, however, Amazon offered a great deal for this item. Only $19.99 with free shipping. A bargain compared to department store or Cusinart website prices. Can't wait to use it!"
3,So-so,"I loved the title, and I picked this book because I found it on the authors list of books-that-changed-your-life. This is not a life changing book. It is ancient but cute humor--I just think someone like Erma Bombeck is a thousand times funnier on the same topics."
2,exolite brace,"This is almost a well designed product, but having broken with 16 hours of having received it, this brace needs improvement. The slim light grey strap of plastic which goes between the thumb and index finger simply broke while I slept. Otherwise the design is light and the rest of the design works well. The velcro adjustment straps which hold the main portion of the brace tightly against the wrist flop around and sort of get in the way. There must be a simple easy disign an improvement to make these two straps less intrusive. If those two flaws are addressed, (and they would be easy changes) this brace would be perfect as it light yet otherwise strong."
4,A to Z Kids Help a Not -Lucky Kid be Lucky,"I wish I could win a seven million dollar lottery ticket for my very own. If you would like to win a lottery ticket, you will sure like this book, because the three best detectives in the whole wide world are in this book and they catch a real lottery ticket thief! The book is also set in winter, many kids favorite time of the year. Although my favorite A to Z Mystery book is The Absent Author, I think this one is pretty good, and I think you'll like it too."
5,Good Book for 3rd Graders,"The book Lucky Lottery is a good book because it is interesting to read about the mystery. The book is kind of hard to read, but it is fun to see what happens next. We recommend this book."
1,Don't buy it,"We had this blender for about 1 year and maybe used it a dozen times, before it stopped working. No know reason. Very unhappy with the product as our previous blender, which was another brand, worked well for a much longer period of time."
5,This is a Very Good Collection,"I have this CD, and I must agree with everyone that this is a great bunch of performances. In my case, I cherish this version of Little Wing. There may be trouble on the horizon, though. My disc was made in Europe by Phillips-Dupont, and they used the dreaded lacquer/sealer on the label that eventually corrodes the aluminum under the label. This is also known as ""CD Rot."" While the data side of the disc shows no signs of this yet, the label side has already turned a bronze color. So, my prized collectable has begun the slow rot process that will eventually render it unplayable."
4,thanx jimi,the sound quality on in the west is awesome. the bass is thumpin' for such an old release. spanish castle magic made it worth buying for me. long live jimi.
2,NO! NO! NO!,"Hey remember me, I'm Franky R. I own every Hendrix ever released. So believe me when I tell you, Don't buy this!!!! It sucks! This is NOT! I say, This is NOT! Jimi in the west! I'm NOT happy with the Hendrix Family! Go buy the original JIMI IN THE WEST! PEACE!"
5,wch cusion,this is all i expected it to be .it is well worth the money and i would recomend it to any one
3,eh.,"it's good for the casting part of the package so you can cast your cat's prints. but i wouldn't use the journal part. BAD. I bought three books on amazon to find the best one, and ""my cat's journal"" by aaron hunt was by far the best, get that one."
1,"Defective on arrival, electrical burning smell after plugging it in.","Installation was easy and looks nice on the wall. BUT after plugging in AC adapter to charge the battery the unit is gave off a burning smell. Thinking that this may be normal as the battery may have been charging, I went ahead and closed the door. Now I can't even open it with the emergency key. There's no way to remove the unit without causing damage to the unit. I'm in the process of getting ETL to correct the problem via warranty work. I may have a bad apple in the batch. For now, I can't recommend purchasing this product."
2,Baby Ballet Blah,"I bought this item for my 3 year old who loves to dance like a ballerina. I thought she would take to this DVD and learn the ""real"" moves. I got her dressed up and ready for her first viewing and she was quickly bored with it. The quality of the video is poor and uninteresting. The lessons are very very slow moving and it was hard to keep her interested in the rest of the DVD. I would recommend ""Barbi and the 12 Dancing Princesses"" over this for little girls who want to dance. My 3 year old learned all of her great turns and steps from them!"
4,Not for babies,"The tape is very well put together, the segments are short, the program is easy to follow and my daughter has a lot of fun with it.I am only giving it 4 stars because the title is absolutely misleading- this is not a tape for babies. The moves require advanced motor skills, the ability to follow instructions and a bit of concentration."
4,Good overview,Mr. Cares is to be commended for an excellent introduction to network operations. He provides much needed background on a much discussed topic. I found his definitions and explanations to be valuable. The book is well illustrated and sourced; providing an excellent primer on the subject. Recommended.
1,Not a good print,This book was unreadable as the words were run together and no periods. I would not recommend this as it is.
3,"1020 mg sodium per serving, 2 servings per package","Tasty, but if you eat the whole bag [and who doesn't] you will have consumed 86% of your daily recommended sodium intake!"
2,Just toooo much comedy relief here.,"Actually, I shoulda known better than to buy a serial after seeing a trailer for it that started with HEY, BOY & GIRLS! This was very obviously aimed at kids with little attempt to entertain their parents. The mystery element (Who's the mysterious and sinister ""Rattler""?) is rather ho-hum. The element where the bad guy is successfully disguising himself as other characters using rubber masks is laughable. The continuing antics of Ken Maynard's sidekick are rather tiring. The chapter endings are nothing to write home about. Mascot has done better western serials such as ""The Vanishing Legion"" and ""The Lightening Warrior""."
4,o ya,This game is gonna rock ive always been a fan more like big fan of yuyuhakusho and no doubt im a anime fan but yyh the best cant wait for this game!
3,So-So,"Hmm. If you're a Brian Michael Bendis fan, already, like myself, then this book will be interesting to you. He's a funny writer, self-deprecating and clever, and his plain, cartoony illustrations work well in telling his fairly comic-strippy story. If you don't know or care about Bendis, then there's not much for you here. A cautionary Hollywood movie-deal story, sure, but those are a dime-a-dozen.The other thing is, it has been a while since I read this, and I can remember very little about it. It's a sort of ""popcorn"" graphic novel, in that it went into my brain and then right out again. It's not bad, but certainly not a story that you'll be thinking about for years to come, like some of Bendis' other work (Jinx, for instance...).I did like it. I just don't know that I could recommend it to anyone who wouldn't already know about it."
4,light reading,"Our older son (8 yr.) likes this book and he's reading all day from it. Nice pictures and good explanations for this age, but a lot of scientific facts are missing.I recommend the book for ages 7-10 or for a light reading."
2,You have to already have a start.,"Although funny, this book does nothing for the ""unknown"" person trying to be ""famous"". Ms. DeLaCruz started this project of hers already being known. For the rest of us, I guess we need to become known for something before we can claim our 15 minutes."
4,Excellent if your a New Yorker...Not for Puerto Rico,"Although my tittle seems to understand that i dislike this book, on the contrair I Love It! I laugh so much my cheecks hurt. Anyway, Im a PR for a government agency in Puerto Rico, so most of the tips are not usefull otherwise this book will be my bible. EXcellent Girls!"
4,"Keep what's good, don't read the bad.","I read through this book at the bookstore one rainy afternoon.At that point in my life, I was interviewing for an internship position for a movie in Canada, so I couldn't find a better read for my foray into filmmaking.I quickly skipped the self-agrandizing and self-promotion parts as well as the annoying name-dropping bits and retained the practical information: get great biz cards,never be too available,know how to develop a unique style.This useful information is the one that is shaded in grey in the book. I didn't like the writing at all and thought it was better directed towards a teen audience, as a woman of substance, I could not care less about the life of these 2 women. Nevertheless, the information that is provided is very useful and can be applied to any field.People who make it in any competitive industry are the ones who are great at self-promotion.It's a great little book for people on their way to L.A or N.Y, or anyone interested in P.R."
4,Very good obscure hard rocker that'll grow on you!!,"I had never heard this band's album from 1979, but purchased it when it came out on the excellent Monster Records label this past year. It definitely has a Thin Lizzy/Judas Priest style and some well written songs. Highlights are the mystic ""Deceive Me"" and the hard rocking ""Kristallnacht"" with cool tempo changes. The guitar playing is excellent throughout. Overall, a very goodCD, not quite a 5 star but another worthwhile purchase"
5,"Durable, Sturdy",This is a real wheelbarrow - small enough for a preschooler to wield. My 4 year old daughter takes her dolls out in it and hauls around items while I do my gardening. This is a sturdy toy with as many uses as the imagination will allow.
5,Love it!,"I love this bottle. I bought the one liter ivory bottle, and its great. Very light (without the water in it), and the larger size allows me less trips to fill it up. Its durable, and there was no smell or taste after washing it once."
4,High class water bottle,This was a gift for my daughter in law and she loved it. I thought it was a bit pricey and I would never had paid that much for me.
3,"good, but can definitely be improved","The Sigg Water bottle is light, good looking, leak-proof,and delivers a fresh clean-tasting drink of water. As far as I'm concerned though, it has a major flaw. There should be a way to secure the top after opening. I want to use it for active outside sports and can't always stop for the time it takes to open, drink, and get the top back on. Who wants to put on a top that has fallen in the dirt? And one bad bounce means I've lost the top entirely."
1,Do not buy!,"Do not buy this cheap piece of junk! The $5 S&H costs more than the product itself and for good reason; it broke on me LITERALLY ten-seconds after opening the product packaging, after just toying with the product as per instructions. I didn't drop it, roughouse it, bump it, etc. I was just USING IT in the manner prescribed, and pieces literally started falling off in my very hands. Save yourself the grief."
4,Nice little rubik's cube,"Overall, I'm happy with this rubik's cube keychain. It's small enough that I can carry it around and it works! The only downside is that sometimes the areas I want to turn lock up and don't budge. It gets frustrating if everything is aligned yet it still won't move. Most of the time though, it works fine. Just a note: If you plan on spending a lot of time on this in one shot...be warned that your hands may hurt afterwards! Not that that's stopped me from using it!"
3,This is a dictionary for the native Korean learning English,"I ordered this from a recommendation that it was one of the best EK/KE dictionaries. Yes, good for a Korean student in an ESL class. Not geared for beginners in the Korean language unless you are in an intermediate-advanced Korean class. The table of contents, introduction, appendices, and support tables are all in hangul. Also, amazon.com says this book has a hardcover when in fact it is paperback with a rubberized cover."
5,Sissy bar bag,"This large bag sits well on any motorcycle with a small luggage rack or using the seat. It carries a lot of ""man stuff"". a 12 pack fits nicely!"
2,"High Language, Annoying Plot","I got about 3/4 of the way through the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Te whole plot centers around Darcy and Bingley's premarital affairs. The author just kept on reiterating this in different ways; so many times, it was irritating. She glossed over births, romance, and Lizzie's personality.There are other P&P sequels that are more worth the money."
1,Not a good sequal...,"...compared to many of the other P&P; sequals...the plot skips, the language does not conform, the characters are not well established. All in all, a very disappointing rendition of Darcy & Lizzy. Would have prefered re-reading P&P; all over again!I suggest other renditions of P&P; sequals. Other books equally good are those that offer P&P; from Darcy's point of view. Specifically the Aiden books. Nicely done!"
4,"Great computer, terrible vista","However it has 2gb of ram and a core 2 duo at 2ghz, it takes like 3 to 4 minutes to load windows, i never tried windows vista before, but i have to say that it sucks really bad, it does not look all that good and its extremely and painfully slow, this has nothing to do with hp anyway the computer is great and there it was nowhere to run, they had to load it up with vista, i was not really expecting such a bad performance from vista, and whats the deal with the new Internet Explorer??? they even put the same short cut keys that firefox had, they have to stop stealing ideas..."
2,The system has crashed 5 times in first 3 days.,"This is unbelievable for me, since I used to work for MSFT. How can they continue to ship operating system which continue to have hand up problems. I bought the system on Sunday, and today is Tuesday and this thing has crashed 5 times. I had to hard boot the computer!!- System hang up issues -- Windows explorer hang up- Task manager froze- I was installing My HP games - and it hangs up while installing Wild Tangent - I waited 11 mintues and since it wasn't doing anything I had to shut it down.- I tried Disk defragmentation and once again - it hnags up on meLast night- it hangs up when I did shut down.Either this is just a bad machine - because everyone else here on Amazon loves there. I have a netowrk at home and run 4 other PC's and laptop and have been in Hi-tech for last 11 years. I am going to take it back and ask for an exchange or just buy another machine."
3,Unsure,"The computer is great, but vista is atrocious. I would recommend this computer to anyone who plans to install a different OS. Otherwise, run away!"
5,Oops -- correction,"Sorry. I was wrong about one thing -- Part 135 has been newly added for 2002 in the Jepp edition. But they're also touting the larger format as a ""feature."" Wake up, Jepp."
3,False Advertising,"As the previous reviewer noted, there's a huge discrepancy between the description and the actual product. I was at first worried and then, when I learned the truth, disappointed to find that the product I'd recieved was much less than promised. Amazon and the publisher should correct the descriptions immediately. And the price should be adjusted (downwards) to match the actual contents."
1,"Awful!!, one of the worst games on PSP!!!","The gameplay is boring! and get's slow if many enemies on the screen at the same time. Also, when fighting a BOSS, the scenes suddenly cuts to the movie for the next level without having totally defeated him yet. In some cases, the life bar had almost a 15% left. TERRIBLE GRAPHICS!!!,almost insulting for a 2007 release.Overall sounds are simple, mediocre.Unlockable features suck!!!Waste of time and money. It is a MUST-NOT-BUY!!"
2,So this is the director people talk about.,"I like arty dramatic films and I like genre films and mixing the two can sometimes create something that is transcendent (Don't Look Now, The Long Goodbye, No Country For Old Men, I Walked With A Zombie, 2001, Blow Up, Badlands, etc.) Not here.There were a few brief moments of tension killed by directing/editing choices that were clumsy and cliched (perhaps an ironic comment on genre cliches?). Too many quirky innocent ramblings about chiggers and books, that, spoken by children, must hold some profundity. The humor of the film came from the colorful locals and didn't seem to have much to do with any directorial intention. And finally, the music. We knew something dramatic was happening on the screen when the music kicked in. Philip Glass or not, the music was intrusive, clunky (like video game music during the action scenes) and cinematically redundant."
4,Man big fuss about what genre this band is...here ya go people,"HASTE THE DAY IS A POST-HARDCORE BAND END OF STORY.anyways, about the cd itself. It is very very well made, and the music on here is great, only problem is due to the same contuinous riffs played over and over agian, the cd will get old in a matter of time, but never the less, great cd"
3,When Everything Falls,"More solo guitar riffs like from Burning Bridges would have been greatly appreciated...Break My Own Heart and Ros King are some good examples .. Anyways i give this album a 3 because they still have some decent guitar and the drums are actually the best part of this album so far. I personally think the vocals were weak , other than that its a sub-par album.."
5,return of the composer,It is already said by others here: Eisners return to the Spirit didn't pass unnoticed. You see the quality raise immediately.His replacements during wartime where merely telling stories with pictures.Will composes words and drawings to a never before seen unity.
2,wild angels and hell's belles,"Wild Angels is one the films that launched the biker genre. Interesting cast of future stars -- Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, Diane Ladd (parents of Laura Dern), Buck Taylor (Neely on Gunsmoke). Violent for it's day, it's pretty tame now. Hell's Belles -- while I was watching this one (which isn't bad) I kept thinking it reminded me of some other movie and then I realized what it was: the old Marlon Brando western the Appaloosa, which was released three years earlier. Same basic plot only set in modern times."
2,Don't bother,"This skinny-minny little booklet isn't worth it at all. Plus the author is very condescending in that he tries to make you feel like if you don't do everything exactly right (i.e. his way), your garage sale will be a dismal failure. I don't agree with that attitude, firstly, and secondly, he tells you almost nothing that you couldn't have either figured out on your own or found on the internet for the price of the internet connection you already have!Summary: Google for garage sale websites for advice - don't waste your money."
2,$12 for a 10 minute DVD????,I think I'll stick to Rob's books....they are only $2 more and last more than 10 minutes.
5,The end of Alex North,"As other reviewers have noted, there is little on this album by Alex North, but the entire score is delightful. Little snippets of Alex North mixed with a music by Milan Svoboda and other pieces-even Henry Purcell's lovely theme from The Gordian Knot. I have not seen the film, but it is a charming quiet end to the career of one the the greatest composers of film scores."
3,Listenable but not outstanding,"I bought this because people said it was a lot Mezzanine; also because Sinead O'Connor does some of the vocals. Overall I think it makes good music to work to, but it doesn't stick in your head like Mezzanine did. The songs aren't particularly ear-catching or memorable, and they aren't quite as intense as what I came to expect after Mezzanine."
3,I found a better follow up album to Mezzanine.,"I love this band but for me Mezzanine just had a more dirty, gritty street DJ kind of grit element to it, especially with all those distorted guitars too. BUT I found a better follow up album to Mezzanine which I love and it's not Massive Attack it's actually this unknown artist called Orpheos and the album is called (Project Retrograde). Found it on amazon and I like it more than that 100th window elevator music.Hope this helps."
2,Who is this band...,"...and what has it done to Massive Attack?So, most of the band fell away, which is sad, because it left ""100th Window"" behind. For some bands, this is a dream album. For Massive Attack, it's a starting point in dire need of refining and perfecting.Independent of the band, this record works as utterly forgettable music to read or sleep to. In conjuncture with Massive Attack's name, it's a disappointment and a bore. O'Connor's contribution makes only about one track - ""What Your Soul Sings"" - stand out. Otherwise, the sound is not meddlesome, in that you won't even notice the songs go buy, and you won't be able to tell one from another.Defenestration is what this deserves. It sounds like it was made by Zero7. It would've been better to burn out with ""Mezzanine"" than to fade away with ""100th Window."""
4,"I guess it's hard to stay ""massive""...","Interestingly, this release seems to follow the current trend of classic trip-hop acts--like Hooverphonic, Future Sound of London, Bjork, and Lamb--having gone quieter, more introspective, and jazz or middle-eastern influenced. I guess this is middle-age setting in on the trip-hop generation.To be honest, I didn't realize that I myself had any expectations for the new album...until I started reading the other reviews, that is. (There's a danger in that, isn't there?) The sound is still best-in-class; but as every other Massive release has been an outstanding 5 of 5 stars, this one can only be 4 at best. Oh well."
4,Beautiful music to soothe the soul,"I became a 'massive':) fan of Massive Attack after i came across Mezzanine about 6 months ago. While Mezzanine was music genius, this new album too deserves great applause - some people may think its boring with no flashy tunes, but to me it's simply beautiful music and great to unwind to. Butterfly Caught is my favourite track."
3,"nothing will be better than ""Protection"" or ""Blue lines""",Very slow and dubish. Somewhat dark. More like Mezzanine than anything else. Will take some getting used to.
5,best yet,"Best Massive Attack album yet. They keep improving and improving, gripping listener's ears like no other band. A must for every electronic music lover."
3,More Accessible Than Mezzanine but .......,"Pushing aside the hype and expectation, this latest Massive Attack effort is very good and provides a more ""accessible"" sound; it's trippy beats and vocals with a slightly menacing tone although not as ""dark"" as Mezzanine. If you are an MA fan by all means pick it up. If on the other hand you are looking for something to change your life, even for a little while, well you missed that train. The MA sound is pretty common now and it's no longer ""underground"" or on ""the edge"". If that's what you need then look elsewhere. Overall a good listen but we've heard it all before."
2,"Bleak, grim, grim....","I think MA have spent too much time reading the papers. This is one of the most depressing, grim, lachrymose CDs I have yet heard. Listening to this in the car CD player on the way to work is the best possible way to get unmotivated to do any work - particularly in the depressing Bay Area economy. Navel-gazing at its worst. Very Goth, very dark, and just a bit too much in general. Verging on monotonous. DO NOT listen to this if you're out of work or mourning a relationship. In fact, even if you're in a cheerful mood, this disc will fix that good and proper. Good production, good atmospherics. The musicians on this disc just really need to get away for a vacation in a sunny place and drink lots of pina coladas. No wonder Sinead's retiring after cutting this CD."
3,Slick but empty,"In defense of MA's impeccable production value, they do dress up writers block rather well, but even in the chillest of subtleties there needs more driving melody than 100th's often bored compositional stance."
1,NFL Street?,How unrealistik is that. If your going to make a game at least base it after something that realy happens.Also the graphics are cheasy. They will never compare to NFL Fever or Madden.Bottom line don't buy this game. If you want a good football game you should buy NFL Fever or Madden.
5,Street Heat,"I must say, I haven't been playing this game very long (a couple days), but so far I am far from disappointed. Between the hits, the smack talking, the hits, the show boating, the hits, the challenges, and the hits, I really love this game. Tons of unlockables and just plain good fun. Watch as your buddy showboats up the sideline online to get plastered to the cement wall. Rockin'."
4,Fun,This game is very fun if your good at it. Thepays are cool and the way that the game can go out of control with one fumble or interception. Yes this game was a rip off of NBA street but who cares if they can pull it off more power too em. FIFA Street will come out pretty soon.
1,Flawless( DeNIro),"I need to know how to return. The disc says it"" cannot be played in this region"". I have never seen this before. Someone sold me a copy that cannot be used. I very much appreciate trading for a useable disc asap. Thank you, Jeanann Eckert"
1,Amazing Grace Stole The Show,"The only character that made this movie watchable was the Black drag queen ""Amazing Grace."" Talk about realism! She kept it real all through the film. Nashom Benjamin/Mona Foote is the greatest drag queen entertainer of all time! He/She dominated the entire movie. Without ""Amazing Grace"" the movie would have rated 1/2 star. With him/her, the movie rates 1.5 stars."
3,Hope you don't need tech support,"Overall, the product is pretty good; hub is a little slow depending on the amount of data you're moving. Beware of their tech support; I was given three different solutions to the same problem, none of which worked--they acted like they just wanted to get me off the phone even though our longest conversation was approx. 5 minutes!"
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited to see this book and anxious to read it, but was so disappointed that I gave up without finishing it. This book is in the same genre as several other books, all of which are far superior: Galileo Galilei by Gould, The Map that Changed the World, by Winchester, Fermat's Enigma by Singh, A History of Pi by Beckman, and Isaac Newton by Gleick. My general complaints are that the author is a bit sloppy, inexact, speculative and his math is imprecise. Examples are: speculative (free men built the pyramids and they represent a sunburst in honor of Ra); inexact (use of truncated decimals for phi, etymology of the word sluggish as related to a slug of mass, and derivation of a pyramid of exactly 52 degrees). The paragraph on the top of p.81 on platonic solids is especially confusing. So while he does make some interesting points, it just isn't worth the trouble."
3,"A RESPECTABLE ATTEMPT, BUT NO INSIDER INFO!!!","Don't buy this book if you're looking for big names...It's basically an analysis of psychology behind fan and wrestler interaction, and an examination of how wrestling relates to our subculture..."
1,Horrible quality and return policy - save your money and do not buy,"The screen arrived used/damaged. I was able to return it, but the $25 I spent on returning it was not refunded. The quality of the screen is extremely poor. Save yourself money and return hassles by not buying this screen."
4,Definate must have,This is one you definately must add to your collection. If you don't like this cd something is definately wrong you :-)
4,Tanya is Deh Best,When I first Tanya Stephens preformed live I knew she had deh making of a true Singer. Her music touchs you in every way you could imagine. You remember the words and you sometimes feel like you are going through what is going on in the song. She knows what she id talking about and she will be around long. Gangsta Blues is proof of that. All the songs have you moving and wanting more. Keep it up Tanya. Caribbean Massive.
5,love it,"i love it, it was exacly what i expected. I love me some Tanya Stephens. she rules man. Gangsta blues"
2,makes a good doorstop,"no information is better than bad information. a new emerging field of art deserves a better book than this. it is very misleading to call it ""the encyclopedia"", for many artists are left out who were very well documented at the time of its publication. it doesn't seem that the people who wrote the bios and info were very well informed, or perhaps they were just showing their bias.the editor(s) should not have allowed that to happen. it does have some nice pictures of artists, but the quality of the art leaves alot to be desired. who decided which artists were included? i am surprised that a museum would put their name on such a publication."
3,Shock the Monkey,"Serial killer who knocks off families is caught red handed by his own son and when brought to terms by the death penalty, survives the electric chair and takes on a new form, hopping from body to body. He then tracks down his son and tries to put an end to him. Excellent NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET clone is well created by the writer/director Wes Craven. And in essence, it's not a clone at all. It eliminates the slow motion from NIGHTMARE and pours on the bone-crunching action which is pre-determined by the heavy metal '80's music played throughout. Very entertaining."
1,Entertainment for the retarded,"I remember seeing this film in theaters way back in the day. I laughed then. I saw it recently at a friend's house and can't believe Wes Craven's career didn't end with this schlock. I don't know what kind of movie this was meant to be. It was too lame to be scary and too stupid to be funny. Running from an 'electronic phantom' through scenes from 'Leave it to Beaver' is enough to make you roll your eyes in disbelief. But diving through a camera lense to end the movie is rock bottom. Wes Craven has had hiots and misses in his long career. Of all his films, this is somewhere at the bottom."
1,"Very, very poor customer support from Simon & Schuster","While the Pimsleur method is extremely effective in teaching you a foreign language, the customer service provided by Simon & Schuster is horrendous. I bought a copy of this product, but one disc was defective. I requested a replacement through the original vendor and have never received a disc. I also requested a replacement directly with Simon & Schuster and have never received a replacement disc.If you call to complain and get too testy with the""Customer Service Representative"", that person will hang up on you.Some may think this not an appropriate review, as I'm complaining about the service being rendered by Simon & Schuster; however, customer service (i.e., supporting the product, so that a buyer can use it) is just as important to me as the quality of the product. It's difficult to complete a course when you're not given all the lessons that you paid for."
3,Romanian: Learn to Speak and Understand Romanian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Simon & Schuster's Pimsleur) (,"Good basic language tutor for the tourist,however, I have completed mastering lesson 6 of 10 and still have not learned the word for Bathroom. I hope it shows up soon or I should expect to be uncomfortable during my trip."
2,What the F$@# is this?,"There was soooooooo much potential for this soundtrack. I mean, I was expecting some cannibal corpse or carcass or some other band death/gore/grind band. But NO! I get #$^%#$% Seether and Finger eleven and other crap! I will give it credit though. It DID have some good bands ( meshuggah, lamb of god for example) and Morbid angel so i will give it a extra star for effort"
4,Son plays with this almost everyday,"We got this toy for my son last Christmas, so it is almost a year old - ancient in toy age and as far as a child's interest in a toy goes. He plays with this almost everyday and holds his attention well. He really loves watching the wheels turn as the tractor goes forward - up close and in great detail. My nephew and all my son's little friends that have come over have also been drawn to it, so our sample size of small kids 18 mos - 3 years says this toy is a hit."
4,Make Sure You Buy This Version,"There are several versions of this toy out there but this is the one you want. It's loud, but not as loud as several of the other models, it's easy to play with and the kids, both of them, a three and a one year old, both play with it. It has great traction on either wood or carpeted floors. Altogether this is a very nice small toy that makes a little too much noise but as long as you can deal with that then don't pass it up. My nephews still play with this a year later."
5,Great toy!,As irritating as toys with noises can be....my daughters both LOVE this toy. They love the old macdonald song and pretending like they are driving as well as riding it themselves.
3,Christmas gift for grandson,My grand son is 2 years old and he was delighted with his tractor. He plays with it a lot and loves all the bight colors. It's perfect and safe for this age child
2,The Last Scream is Always the Worst,"That should have been the title. The only thing that kept me watching to the end was waiting for Jay and Silent Bob to come back to kick evil's...you know. ""Hey look Silent Bob, it's Connie Chung (Gail Weathers)!"" They are the only reason that I even gave this movie any stars at all ( 1 1/2 for their appearance, plus 1/2 for assuring us that this series ends with this one ).Rent it to see Jay and Silent Bob. The only reason I would buy it would be to add their cameo to my View Askew collection."
1,"The most insipid horror movie since ""I Know...Last Summer 2""","This movie is basically an intelligence test: If you liked it, have your head examined. As a fan of horror movies, I am sickened that this movie was released, let alone somehow enjoyed by some people."
3,Not bad but not great.,"Scream 3 is the most disappointng of the triology and I am very happy they stopped after this one. Directed once again by Wes Craven, Scream 3 has all the same cliches as the first two and although the twists were sharp and witty, you just felt cheated and let down by the Hollywood style ending. The house explosion scene is the best of the entire series I have to admit but casting Jenny McCarthy and Parker Poser it's like just kill them already! Scott Foley who I like on Felicity, plays against type in this one, you can see him struggle tremendously. Scream 3 overall isn't awful, it's just the weakest of the series."
4,Good conclusion to the series,"Decent plot, good characters, good directing. The identity of the killer keeps you guessing up to the end, just like the first two movies. Plenty of inside jokes about the movie industry, some of which I got, and many others I'm sure I missed. Ordinarily I'm not a fan of movies about movies, but when it's a send-up, I suppose I can relax the rules a bit. Carrie Fisher in her cameo was hysterical. I was happy to see that they brought Jamie Kennedy back for the finale--I thought he was the most entertaining character from the first two movies. Wes was a little enigmatic with his final closing shot, seeming to say that he's still open to making a fourth film. That could happen, but frankly, I think Wes said what needed to be said in the trilogy. No need to serialize it any further, and if he tried, I don't think it would make him a buck. Worth the price of a rental, or if you are a fan of the genre, a purchase."
2,No Rules Broken,"This is trailered as the part in which ""all bets are off"" and "" there no more rules"". Forget it, it follows all the rules and doesn't break one. After a fantastic opening sequence, it never quite reaches the same pitch again. The first two are still great, but this has no guts at all, you are more likely to be scared eating an hot apple pie. Wait for TV, Tape it, watch the pre-credits sequence and the cameos from Carrie Fisher, Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, and dump the rest. It's not scary, it's not violent and it's not funny.Try Cherry Falls - that's far more fun"
3,"""Pritty Good"" The second best scream in the Trilogy","This is the ""Final Cut"" the final movie in the trilogy. Though not as good as the second in my opinion, its by far better than the first. There are only three things that hold this movie back from being a A+ movie, #1 film editing, though the film looked great in some areas it lost all its lushure. #2 better soundtrack, all the music in the movie is purely forgettable. #3 better acting, Neve Campbel, Dave Arcwet, and Cortiny Cox, are the only good actors in the movie every one else needs to find a new perfeshon than being an actor.These here are the reasons that this movie is not a A+, movie these are not the reasons not to watch it. Because watch it its a good popcorn movie that many will enjoy, seris fans may not like the ending but they will enjoy the overall ""Final Cut"" of the Scream Trilogy."
5,FINAL PART OF THE TRILOGY - THE BEST ONE!,"I don't need to explain the plot, I'm not going to tell you anything (above you can read what you have to know)... I just wanna say that this movie is the best part of the trilogy, and one of the best movies (no kidinn') ever made. Also, the bonus materiall on this DVD is just fantastic. Anyone who don't like Scream movies will be suprised with Scream 3, and for all of you who admire these movies and Wes... Don't read further... Buy this DVD!"
3,Correction to earlier Review,The extras were there...they were just incredibly hard to find. I will leave that mystery to you all to make up for the lack of real mystery in this film.
3,Other two are better,"This movie, SCREAM 3, was good, but not great. The plot of the story was hard to follow, the lines were repeated about 5 times, and it was boring. But, there were some scenes that made you laugh a lot. But, if I had to rate the SCREAM trilogy, the first would come first, second second, and third third. But hey, what do I know."
4,Scream 3---Scary and Hip!,"""Scream 3"" combines scariness, a cool cast, and totally freaky moments. It can compare by far to ""Scream 2,"" but not that much to the original. This is an awesome finale to the trilogy that rocked and terrifed audiences across the world. This is definitely a film you'll want to see again and again."
4,Well Worth the wait.,"Great end to the series, it even makes up for the disappointing Scream 2. Good acting around, But the credit has to Go To Neve Campbell ; who keeps you glued to your seat with her electrifying performance of Sidney, and Parker Posey who gives a show stopping comic performance to this movie.You will not be disappointed."
4,Scream 3 rules!,"after enjoying the other 2 screams,this one topped them off!forget what happened in the first 2,this one changes them all!if your in for a good slasher flick,this is the one 2c!"
3,THIS SERIES SHOULD HAVE ENDED WITH THE 2ND ONE,"THE FIRST AND SECOND ONES WERE DONE VERY WELL AND WERE REALLY GOOD. THEY SHOULD HAVE ENDED THIS WITH THE SECOND. THIS ONE IS NO WHERE AS SCARY, OR AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS 2.THEY BRING BACK DAVID ARQUETTE, NEVE CAMBELL AND COURTNEY COX FROM THE OTHER 2 AND THEY REALLY, REALLY TRY TO MAKE THIS ONE WORK BUT CAN'T. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY POINTLESS AND FUNNY. BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK THEY WANTED IT TO BE FUNNY. THEY REALLY MISSED THEIR MARK ON THIS ONE. IF YOU SAW THE OTHER TWO, CONSIDER THE SERIES DONE WITH THE SECOND ONE AND DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE."
1,scream 3,i have watched this movie all the way through and i have a few words to say about it is utter... the whole plot of it is stupid the first movie was enough and all these movies are not scary and should be located in the family section if you have to see this movie dont pay more that 1 cent to rent it or wait till it is on t v but i woudlnt waste the eletcric on it.
1,A kill and trash movie,"This movie is representative of today Hollywood standards, that is to say a movie with no plot nor acting. The movie is very stupid with a lot of involuntary humor. It is not scary at all, when i see it i fell asleep. This movie is only a product for teenagers. If i could i would give 0 star for the movie. The movie will bee forgot after 1 month, it is like eating an hamburger at Mac-Donald."
3,Great for Scream fans!,My fiance is a Scream buff so I got this for her. The movie is enjoyable to watch and it came in good condition and on time.
4,Awsome game,"This game is ...awsome only thing is the challange mode is tough,when the only team you got is your created team your pretty much [in trouble] if a guy gets by you. its still a great game though.If you dont have it yet buy it now!"
3,they awesomest game eva,"man, this game kicks any other game away. Not that hard not that easy. Great to play with other friends. Whatcha gonna do bout that game madden?"
3,To Stinkin hard.,"I've been playing this game for about a week now and geez is this game frustrating. First of all you might as well just let the computer do the defense because it is literally impossible.The other thing is I haven't been able to beet 1 team yet! I can understand if they want to make the game challenging, but this is over the top! The good part is all the available customizations that you can do to your player. The graphics are ok, but they get the job done. There are also many teams to choose from including a legends team. Overall I think this game is just on par."
4,its worth buying it,the game itself is ok but its just too difficult to win anny of the challanges.tip: only buy it if you're really good at these games.
4,Motorola MD7001 2 Line 5.8GHz Digital Expandable Cordless Handset & Charger Accessory for MD7000 series,"This phone is great. The battery backup is a plus. It also has shared and individual handset phonebooks which is nice. The multiple ring tones are also very useful. At 5.8 GHz, it is very clear, even next to my microwave. The only drawback is the talk time battery life. I typically only get 2-3 hours max talk time. Good thing I have two handsets. I would recommend the phone if you need a solid two line cordless unit with a fully functional base unit."
2,Mehhh,I used this only a couple of times (then found a great Physical Therapist) while running. I found it dug into the back of my leg (popliteal area). It was also hot and uncomfortable in general. I'm not sure if if helped much because all I noticed was how much it was digging in and how hot it was.
1,Beware the Bait and Switch,"I first heard of this band with the release of the single ""Swing Life Away"", which I thought was good enough to merit a listen to the entire album. The album as a whole is nothing like the single. It is very punk rock with lots of unintelligible screaming, empty lyrics and poor vocals from the lead singer. After researching the band (which I should have done first) I found that they've had a few albums before this one. It's clear to me now. They were a medicore, no-name band so their record label released a ""pop"" sounding song to trick the unsuspecting into buying the album. So if ""Swing Life Away"" is what brought you here, then do yourself a favor and just download it."
1,"Rise Against...Sponsored by Coca-Cola, Nextel and Nike...","A band of ""antiestablishmentarians"" signed to a major label...do I see a contradiction in terms here? Rage Against the Machine for the new millenium masses, Rise Against is the epitome of what is wrong with the music industry today. How on the one hand can you claim to want to change the system but then utilize some of the most evil and ultracorporate tools to do this? (i.e. MTV, Dreamworks!) The music is pop-core punk at best and the message is clear: Do as I say, not as I do. If you want to incite change through music then: 1. Sign to an independent label or create your own label. 2. DO NOT under any circumstances make a friggin video for play on MTV. 3. Tour Relentlessly 4. Do Not take your fans for idiots 5. Back your message with actions not hollow words. These guys are the lowest common denominator in the music industry."
1,"These guys are awesome, they support things...",Like vandalism in their music videos. I am so glad Bush won the election before they put their video out so they could look about as lame as possible right off the bat.
5,4.5 stars,"Rise Against is one of my favorite bands. i have all there cds, revolutions per minute being my favorite. this cd is different and also similar. it is deffiently alot more political which is good. but it lacking the great, touching, beautiful lyrics on the other 2 albums. best track is give it all, life lesss freighting and swing life away (accostic)peace-love-unity"
4,"They didn't ""Give It All""","While I love their first two albums, this one is nowhere near as good. Maybe its because they sorta sold-out but whatever it is, this CD just isn't as hard as their last two, its still a good album, but its just not the same. Their are a few good songs, but alot of the songs fall short.Its stil a good album, but if you want to hear Rise Against, get one of their first two.Hopefully next time around these guys can work it out and once more Rise Against."
5,Rise Against cranks out another great album,"When I first heard this album, I was disappointed that I didn't think it lived up to Revolutions Per Minute, but after a few listens, I've found that I really like it. No, I still don't think it's as good as RPM, but it's still a fantastic album. There are quite a few top-notch songs on here, but with that comes the one reason that I think this album isn't as good as their last. There are a few songs that I just don't like or really don't do anything for me, which is a change from RPM, where I liked pretty much every song. Those few tracks aside, everything else on here is great and is sure to please any Rise Against fan and just about everyone else."
4,Good Book,The books by M.C. Beaton are always good. I sometimes wish they were longer so I could read more.Keep up the good writing. Thank you for entertaining me.
4,QUICK STUDY OF LEONARDO,"If you are looking for a quick study of Leonardo da Vinci, this book will detail some of the masters outstanding accomplishments achieved throughout the course of his life. Using a inquiry format, a variety of questions are posed and answered in brief about the inventions, paintings and techniques employed by da Vinci. This book highlights important works, and provides the reader of an overview of the incredible lifetime achievements (and quirks) of the artist. I really liked this book, and will use it as a quick reference."
2,high-end pc drivel,"The usual preoccupations of the usual feminist critic are somewhat alleviated here by an apparent intelligence that rises somewhat above the usual drivel of the usual feminist critic. Still, these usual preoccupations are here: justice, inclusion, the sainthood of all minorities and women. Save your money. Even when this critic tries to be fair, it's all so much posing, as she attempts to get through the narrow labyrinth of thought permitted to feminists by other feminists. A completely awful book that is somehow made more awful by the obvious fact that this writer probably has intelligent things to say but is corralled by the Agenda."
4,Laymon knows what horror really is,"Richard Laymon, whose books are very hard to locate in the US, knows something that many of his contemporaries do not. He knows what horrific means. Horror is supposed to shock, revile, and sicken. Otherwise, it's just a pleasant story with a little shock value mixed in. Laymon shows he understands this by holding no taboos with his writing. Yeah, he shows us cannabalism and incest, but those are downright terrifying subjects to most people. Readers can stick to their nice cozy formulated horror stories, or they can try Laymon."
3,Midnight's Lair,"Another reviewer said it best - ""a great story gone wrong"". There was no ""meat"" to this book. I'm not even a writer, but I saw so many places in the book where the story could have gone much futher. In the hands of another writer this could have been a great book. Laymon seems to be writing for horny teenagers."
2,"A little about a lot of things, but not much about anything","This book is ok, if you want to know just a little about a lot of things and not much about anything... I was disapointed at all the collectible toys they left out... Too much on hot wheels, beanies and old tin toys and not enough on Barbie, Fisher Price etc. Nothing on Transformers, Slot Cars or other popular collectibles. Prices do not jive with Schroeders or current market. Photos ok, but not great. A ok book if you want to know just a little about some things. I was disapointed, I returned my copy..."
5,Calming and Lovely,"I have not seen the movie for which this soundtrack was written, but I am grateful for this CD. The music is so lovely it draws you to it in the most peaceful, lovely way. I happily recommend this CD particularly if you have a hard time falling asleep. This CD and the soundtrack to ""Never Let Me Go"" in fact, particularly ""Never Let Me Go"" allow me to fall asleep 95% of the time and, for me, that is really saying something. There is not a ""why did they stick this in here?"" cut in either CD allowing for undisturbed enjoyment."
1,Missing Something,"The music in this CD is as represented, but for no stated reason, the concluding vocal by The Graces ""Time will wait for no one"" is not present on the album. This is very disappointing and really spoiled the concept of a ""Soundtrack"" album. Almost misrepresentation. A shame, because this is one of my top 10 favorite films!"
1,S-l-o-o-o-w,"Others have commented on the major weaknesses of this phone, but I'll add my own pet peeve: everything is so bl**dy SLOW! To scroll down through the phone book feels like click-pause-click-pause-click-pause.... Each handset defaults to private phone book use, so to switch to the shared phone book involves a couple of button-pushes, each of which takes ages to respond. And don't try getting ahead of it: your button pushes may or may not be recognized.What a piece of junk."
2,Motorola MD7081 1.5GHz digital 2 line phone,"This was a very poor choice on my part. I thought Motorola was a reputable brand however the quality is below average. The sound is not clear. When I raise the volumn it sounds tinny and if I lower it, you can not hear. I would not recommend buying it."
3,Disappointed,"Nothing like the quality and ease of use of Motorola's cell phone line. Some of the problems I see with this phone:1. The LCD can not be adjusted while sitting flat on a desk. It is difficult to see incoming calls or the phone book.2. If you use the base model's handfree function, it sometimes will not let you switch back to the handset. I need to unplug the power to the base to correct this.3. Both the wireless handsets and base do not allow you to decrease the volumes enough to make much of difference. If you are hard of hearing you'll love these phones.4. The phone book won't let you sort by name.I could go on."
4,Egg-free waffles with this mix,"I used this mix to make waffles and used 2 TBL. flax seed meal in place of the egg. Added about 1/4 cup extra rice milk. This was pretty good. The flax gives it a little nutty flavor. I prefer savory toppings to sweet, so not sure if this would compliment berries or jam. Fresh maple syrup seems to compliment well. Be warned that this isn't a fluffy waffle though like the traditional waffle that is soft to cut into. This waffle is pretty dense and crispy when done, but I like them that way. I prefer waffles to pancakes so I haven't even used this mix to make pancakes yet."
5,Like Natural Gas-X,"With the consumption of flour threatening my bowels and leaving me a stinky time bomb at the office, I knew there had to be a better way. Fortunately, Bob found that solution. Gluten free pancake mix tastes just like the pancakes you lived off in college, but without the threat of bloating, abdominal cramps, and stinky explosive dangerous farts.If you are gluten intolerant or have Celiac's, then this is the product for you. Cheap and tasty with out the side effects of regular pancakes."
4,Yum,"These are pretty fantastic for from a mix pancakes. If you follow the instructions from the package to make them they're kinda so-so, but if you substitute 1/2 a cup of yogurt and enough liquid to thin the the batter to the proper consistency for the milk that it asks for you get a really fluffy and pleasantly sweet pancake. Without the addition of the acid from the yogurt they taste a little too much like baking soda and don't rise very well.I suspect one could use orange juice to the same effect if you were avoiding dairy/soy/nut liquids."
1,DOA,I bought this about a year ago. Have used it maybe 6 times. Today it died!I am more than a little annoyed.
1,Very Poor Video Quality.... it's a ordiray 80's home video,"I'm very disappointed... I'm purshased with great expectations, but it's te wost original DVD I saw ever!! very very poor video & audio quality, even with traking problems from original tape!! It's a home video, made with a ordinary and cheap camera of 80's, and viewed millions of times. The earliest Public Enemy VHS saw too much better. REALLY. I am #1 latin Public Enemy fan, and I'll always be. But this DVD sucks."
5,Beautifully Written!,Everything all these reviewers say are true-it's a great book. Something that really kept me captivated throughout the book was its almost poetic flow of words. It's been a long time since I've read a book where I've laughed outloud and have been lost in thought musing over a beautifully written sentence. A great read that kept me involved right to the end.
3,Disappointed,"I love the video, and will keep it. But I was dismayed and disappointed that it was entirely in German, although the case said ""Language: English""."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this bag about a year ago and within 6 months the vertical zipper on the front pocket broke. I contacted STM and even though I no longer had the receipt, agreed to replace the bag. I have had the new bag for about 3 months and the vertical zipper on this bag has broken as well.It is a pretty great bag overall, but when one of the major storage compartments is no longer usable, the bag itself is pretty much a waste."
3,"Godforsaken, neverending tributes","Let's get something straight ... I LOVE tributes. I collect as many as I can get (for bands I enjoy). THIS tribute was organized by the same guy who did the ""Anthems of Rust & Decay"" tribute to Marilyn Manson a few years back. As is usually the case, HALF of the songs on the album are good, and the other half are POOR tributes. Screaming the words and playing the music doesn't make a good tribute. There are some harsh elements to this CD, including the ridiculously pathetic band, ANNO DAEMONICUS (or whatever it is) ... Don't buy this unless you are absolutely, 100% a HARDCORE FAN of NIN, or at the very least, some kind of ""collector."""
2,Stewardess: Come Fly with Me!,"I was disappointed with this publication. Having been a Pan American stewardess from 1956-58 and stationed in New York, I was looking forward to seeing something about Pan Am. It was a great airline at the time and I thought it deserved more than a small photo. Quantas and other foreign airlines got more press."
3,A little more would have helped.,"I purchased this book as reference material for graphic illustrations. I was warned by previous reviews to take caution in its purchase, but didn't pay attention. The idea of the book was good, but it took me nowhere. The book could have been produced on a larger format,i.e., larger photos. There was very little body, pardon the pun,to describe the history of this profession. The photos had little or no drescriptions positioned near them. The era of the airline stewardess intrigued me while growing up, and it reminded me of a time when flying was an experience and not a security risk. This book was close, but just missed the runway."
1,Come Copy Me,"This book is a blatant and poorly written rip-off of Come Fly Wih Us: a Global History of the Airline Hostess (which came out a couple of years ago). For excellent historical writing and fabulous vintage photos depicting flight attendants, go with Come Fly With Us. Stewadess: Come Fly With Me is a very pale, hastily thrown together imitation."
1,It only gets worse overtime,"I know it's hard to find a 2-line cordless phone, but this one isn't it...move along. It seemed to me to have everything, and it pretty much does. My challenge has been the manufacturing quality. About 6 months after purchase, I noticed the LED screens starting to fail (cutting off the top of the words at first, then later turning everything into broken characters that look like some ancient unknown script). It didn't just happen on one handheld, but both...which I had bought separately - thus it couldn't just be a lemon. Now a couple of years later, I'm looking to buy a new phone: the batteries die within 20 min (they never worked well, especially when using the speaker option); the phone loses the signal and disconnects calls; it won't let me dial as it's ""out of range"" when I'm 2 feet from the base; on and on. Clearly it's unusable and so clearly I've got to buy something else. Learn from my mistakes and buy something with better quality from the start."
1,Dribble,"I'm an avid Sci-Fi fan. I loved Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, even if the early OL was a bit campy. But....this series is horrendous. The A/V quality equals that of a high school education film. I've watched about ten episodes so far....and each one was excruciating to watch. You're not missing anything if you skip this set."
5,Bradbury is Awesome,"I Thoroughly enjoyed this series, but then when I was a kid, I also read Amazing Stories magazine. Bradbury has an awesome imagination."
4,My Generation's Twilight Zone,I loved The Ray Bradbury Theater in my teens. I watched it everyday after school on the USA Network. It was this anthology series that led me to discovering Ray's wonderful novels in my high school library. And in the years since I've become a big fan of Mr. Bradbury's works. I was very excited to add this to my DVD library and am looking forward to reacquainting myself with the series.The only problem I have with this product is the packaging. The 5 discs are stacked on top of one another on a single large spindle. Horrible way to secure DVDs as they tend to scratch one another.
5,LOTS OF GOOD MOVIES TO WATCH !!!!,LOTS OF GOOD SHOWS TO WATCH!!!! YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU GOT THIS ONE !!!!
4,Ray Bradbury does not disappoint,"The stories of Ray Bradbury were some of my favorite reading in the 70s.This series from the Ray Bradbury theatre captures the tone and style of Bradbury very well (he, of course, produced or directed or both). The only drawback to this set was no subtitles, which I forgot to check out before I purchased. I just like to have them on so I can ""hear"" better!"
4,not close-captioned,"The item description says that these videos are close-captioned but they are not, nor are there any subtitles. If you are hard of hearing and purchase this set, you will be disappointed."
5,RAY BRADBURY THEATRE DVD COLLECTION,"I BOUGHT THE RAY BRADBURY DVD COLLECTION ON AMAZON. I RATE IT, EXCELLENT. IF THERE WAS MORE TO THE COLLECTION, I WOULD BUY THEM TOO."
