5,Kitten's First Full Moon,"I felt that this book connected to me in a way most childrens books do not. It seemed like the milk was a metaphore and that , like the kitten was chasing after something that was not there, but through perserverence it will eventually be found. This is not just a children's book, but a book for all ages."
4,Poor kitten!,"Kevin Henkes, Kitten's First Full Moon (Greenwillow, 2004)Kevin Henkes' books never fail to bring the cute, and Kitten's First Full Moon is no exception. The kitten in question mistakes the full moon for a big bown of milk, and spends the book trying to find ways to get to it, failing each time as expected (with a ""poor kitten!"" refrain attached each time). It's both sadly humorous and adorable. If you've never discovered Kevin Henkes, it doesn't matter what age you are, this is one to look up. Very good stuff. ****"
5,They did the trick.,Good for everyday use at home when you want to keep your hands clean. I think nothing else needs to be said about this.
1,incomplete book,"this reprinting is incomplete,there are no illustrations,which should make up a good part of this book."
1,AVOID THIS TRASH AT ANY VALUE,"John Carpenter's Escape from l.a. is like watching a Late Frank Zappa Festival over the sea. Kurt Russell wasted (he did that much better in Breakdown, than this movie), Stacy Keach (In a Ridiclous mike hammer type role), the only surprising member in this sequel is Steve Buscemi, otherwise please pass on this."
1,Cinematic Abomination,"It is sad that a masterpeice like Escape from New York has been tainted by an awfull sequel such as Escape from LA. The sequel has none of the magic or creativity present in the first, not to mention, its just plain awfull. The storyline in part II is modeled after the first, but is not as compelling, and sadly either are the charachters. The Duke of New York is A#1. This movie is good for keeping the campfire going."
5,Escape from L.A.,This is the second part to the previous escape from New York. This movie has lots of action and is a must have for anyone that loves John Carpenter films. Highly recommend.
5,Another Doss success!,"James D. Doss is one of my favorite writers, and no book of his ever disappointed me. The book itself was fine. It came in a timely manner and I applaud Amazon for its services."
5,Outsanding,Don't even have to be a Fighter Driver to love this CD. Even Flying Heavy's you'll love this CD.
4,Pretty Good Beans,"These beans make a good, but not great cup of espresso. They have a little too much roast making the coffee too bitter for my taste. The beans were fresh and the roast was consistent throughout -- the beans are dark and oily. They don't suit my taste but if you prefer your espresso with a little more roast/bitterness you won't go wrong here."
4,Good service for good-tasting product,"Good service, even though it took 3-4 days longer than usual to receive this product. Good price for good-tasting coffee. Will reorder."
1,Already broken!,"I've had this unit for just a couple of months, and now it seriously skips on almost every DVD I play. Moving the same DVD's to one of my other DVD players produces a perfect experience. Like others who have had similar problems, I can't take advantage of the 30-day return policy. I'm just throwing it away and will look for something better."
1,Major problems with this product,"I have a love-hate relationship with this product. I love the features and the style, but the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. The image stalls, freezes or flutters when playing a DVD. Very annoying and unwatchable. So figuring it was a defective unit I returned it and got another. Same problem. I tried connecting it through S-Video cable instead of RCA Cables. Same problem. Returned the unit, and after a lot of soul searching bought the same unit for the third time...After all, they couldn't all be bad. WRONG. Another bad unit. It's going back today, and I'll be buying another brand."
2,Not a keeper,"I returned the DVD-V2000 after a few days for the following reasons:1. Noisy disk drive.2. On DVD playback, part or all of the picture would occasionally break up; I have never seen this happen on my older standalone Samsung DVD player.3. Response to the remote control is delayed by at least a second, making the remote awkward to use. Also the rew/FF buttons do double duty as skip-to-scene buttons, and it requires precise timing (very difficult with the delayed response) to get the mode and speed you want. I found it almost impossible to rewind just a few seconds to catch something I missed; I generally ended up either holding the button down too long and going into quadruple speed, or releasing too soon and skipping back to the beginning of the scene.On the positive side, the remote is universal and worked fine with my Sony TV."
1,horrible product,"Do not buy this unless you enjoy grainy pictures from your video tapes and horrible sound quality from both videos and DVD's. I bought this product a couple months ago and have spent the entire time trying to make different adjustments, settings, connections to make the thing work properly. I have sat through too many movies trying to get the sound to come through without having to constantly adjust the volume up and down to hear parts of movies. In fact I have missed entire portions of movies because the sound was so horrible and tinny. I have given up my battle with this beast and bought an inexpensive Panasonic VCR player and an inexpensive JVC DVD player and am now able to watch both videos and DVD's with theater quality sound and picture. Unless you are hard of hearing and only watch subtitled/closed caption movies don't buy this product."
2,very noisy dvd drive,I had to return this model because the dvd drive makes a constant extremely high pitched chirping sound that made my ear sore. The sound was very noticeable during quiet parts of a film and distracted me from enjoying the film. I bought a panasonic dvd player and a toshiba vcr player and am much happier.
1,Nothing but problems,"I've had this unit over a year, it's been ""repaired"" twice. There is always a problem when playing dvd's. It constantly messes up. The vcr player is a little loud but not too bad. I bought an extended warranty which was a waste of money because they wouldn't exchange my unit for a new one and the repairs never helped. From my own personal experience I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone. If the company would like to do their job and exchange it for a new one and it works I would be happy to write a better review. In the meantime I'm in the process of looking for a new unit to buy, scared stiff at this point of another lemon bought from a company that doesn't stand behind their product. For those of you who have had no problems with this product, count your blessings, we have not all been so lucky to purchase a good one. Do I seem bitter?"
4,A great unit.,"This VCR/DVD combo is terrific. The first thing that struck me was how solid it is. The other VCR's I own (NAME BRAND) have VERY flimsy buttons, so this unit impressed me. The remote control is intuitive, it works well.I have a samsung television for 18 years in my kitchen that works EXTREMELY well to this day, which was the reason i went for samsung when I was shopping for a DVD/VCR unit for the bedroom.I recommend it."
1,Worst electronics purchase EVER,I would like to return this to Best Buy and light it on fire on their front steps.The spinning cd motor can be heard through the auxilliary outputs. DVD's are unplayable. The remote is horrible. We need a class action suit.
1,URGH!,"When your first single is as bad as Poison you've really got nowhere else to go after that! The TV show (which I LOVED) was just a poor excuse to record really weak songs and try and get away with it (which, unfortunately, they have), these songs are weak and uninspired, Poison is positively BORING! I don't have a problem with ""manufactured "" pop, in fact I LOVE it, but this IS BAD manufactured pop. There quite simply ISN'T the talent behind Bardot to make them pop superstars the likes of Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, NSync or even the Spice Girls."
1,Right-on jennycook,"Right On, Jenny! I hate it when people use these reviews as a place for free advertisements. I'm only interested in reading what other genuine customers have to say it."
5,Good Movie of a Great Graphic Novel,This is very toned down from the Tank Girl comics but is still super fun. The musical number in the middle of the movie is my favorite part.
1,Possibly one of the top ten stupitest movies,Really bad movie thats all I have to say. It did not make any sense. If you think that this is a classic you have to have a poor intelligence.
5,Unique Movie,"I really liked this movie the 1st and only time I saw it. When me and my boyfriend first moved in together, he showed me this movie because he really liked it... well, after watching it my VCR ate the tape during rewinding! I just bought this for him because he probably would never think this would be a Christmas present of his, but I'm glad to finally replace it. It is a very good movie with a quite interesting and strange plot. I can't wait to watch it again!"
3,"Not as good as Mad Max, but similar in story line.","I am biased in my review of this movie, since I played an extra with some stunt work during filming at a mine near Nogalas Arizona. The movie portrays a world with a water shortage(Mad Max) and a group of crusaders that are defying the so called government/military power. Lori Petti is one of these individuals. The film follows her through her adventures to dethrone Malcom McDowell as the leader of this military power controlling what little water is left. This movie is worth seeing if you like this type of science fiction, I have been told by many women that they loved the film because the leading actor is a women. As far as seeing it multiple times, I am in it and do not watch it. See it for yourself and make up your own mind!"
4,this movie is Quality!,"An excitingly fun movie! Though the movies is slightly lacking in plot, there is enough action and color to go around. I am big fan of this film."
1,Useless,"This is a terrible case for my MZ-RH10. The case holds my md player perfectly, and nothing else. There isn't enough room within the case to also have my earphone plugged up. When it is plugged up, the case won't close. That's just the dumbest thing ever.Sony should wise up."
5,Blood Lure,"I personally thought that this was one of Nevada Barr's very best books.It is informative and intertaining at the same time; with some amusing content.I highly recommend this one to any Barr reader, you cant go wrong."
2,Weak Point in Barr's Series,"I've enjoyed most of the Barr series as light mystery fare with a interesting, spunky protagonist. The character of Anna Pigeon has always spoken to me in these books. However, I borrowed this audiobook to entertain me on long driving trips and was disappointed. The story is not a taut as her others. Usually the storyline contains a window into the Pigeon's personality and psyche, which long-time readers expect, but this book just plods along without any personal focus on Pigeon and proceeds to the end of a pretty rote, predictable mystery plot."
3,Blood Lure by Nevada Barr,"Although I had this easily and greedily read in 10 hours, I was a little disappointed in the ending. I am a huge fan of Anna Pigeon and will look forward to ""visiting"" the next national park Anna is assigned to and seeing how all the characters are doing (especially her sister who was absent this time)."
4,Based in Glacier,We chose this book because we were taking a train trip to Glacier National Park. It was great fun to listen to it together on the trip west. Once we got there we then tried to locate the areas that Nevada Barr wrote about in her story. We plan to coordinate other books written by Nevada Barr with our trips.
4,Pretty good,"I was pretty satisfied with this Wing Chun DVD by William Cheung.Vol. 4 shows both Butterfly sword forms and Dragon Pole forms and their applications vs each other. (Title/Cover from volume number does not give information on what it will teach...amazon reviewers, please include current reviewed DVD vol. and what it will cover if others not done so). William Cheung's 3x repetition was helpful for me catch up without rewinding too much. His vocabulary was somewhat limited that slightly hinders it from being a perfect instructional DVD but its nothing to worry bout after continuously watching it over again.The only thing I didn't like was the DVD options was very limited. There are no chapter select, so I have to manually fast foward the DVD all the way to the last 24 remaining minutes that teaches Luk Dim Boon Kwan (Dragon Pole form) Takes me bout 2-3 minutes realtime to wait til it reaches the Dragon pole part."
2,Heed the Warnings,"This was the most disappointing purchase I have made in a long time...I should have paid attention to the reviews here and elsewhere.This player started failing the first night I had it - would stop playing even though it appeared it was still going. I changed the batteries, reformatted and ensured it wasn't corrupted MP3's but no such luck. Half of the pages on Creative's support web site were non-existant and since there was virtually no documentation with the product I was stuck. And very unhappy.When it was working the sound quality was pretty lousy, too, despite the programmable EQ. I was a bit surprised as I had once thought that Creative was the leader in portable digital audio.I would highly recommend the iRiver 1FP-380T, which is what I replaced this piece with. For LESS money you get way better quality, durability, stability, upgradability and overall product satisfaction."
2,Such a shame...,"I had such high hopes for this machine. I have had my eye on one since they came out, but I've now gone through two of them and both were defective. It sure is small and easy to use when it works, but my first one had a propensity to shut off with no warning, and my second one blasts me with static every once in a while and the red light won't stop blinking when it should be green. I thought maybe my Windows Media files were corrupted, but they play just fine on my computer. I'm returning this thing and getting a different product."
1,"Great product, but defective....","I loved my MuVo, it's awesome. But after a few weeks of use, it stops playing mp3's. Still works as a usb hard drive, but stops playing mp3's. Not only that, but it also drains batteries that you put in, even if it's not being used after this problem occurs. My muvo, and my friends muvo had the same exact problem. Save your money, don't buy this just yet. If this problem was not present, I would defenitely give it 5 stars."
4,Neat Gadget,"I received this for Christmas and I really love it so far. It is small, lightweight, easy to use. The sound quality is awsome! The only problem I have had is after about 3-4 hrs of play it will randomly shut off. I can turn it back on & it will be fine for a few songs then shut off again. I placed a new battery in & it was fine for awhile. I thought it was the player so I took it back & got another one. It also does the same thing after about 3-4 hrs play. Not near the 10-12 hrs it said it can do. Other than that I really like it."
2,They tend to die early,Got my Nomad Muvoabout 5 months ago and now its dead and out of warranty. (3 months limited warranty)The unit performed alright while it worked however.Avoid if you want something that lasts.
1,"Could have been great, Worst product quality ever!","I've had this unit for a little over 3 months and it broke with very little use.The USB portion still works fine for files, however the sleeve that makes it portable and functional as a mp3 player just stopped working. There's really no parts that could have broke, yet still it did.Because it's barely over the horrible 90 day warranty there are no options to get my money back on it. Creative labs has the worst tech support line I've had the displeasure of calling into.My recomendation, look into an iPod, or some of the new smaller MP3 players on Amazon. This device may be small and cool, but it's not worth it due to the poor quality control."
1,It was nice while it lasted...,"I loved this for it's very small size, reasonably good sound, easy drag-n-drop interface, and ability to use it as a USB hard drive.But, like so many other Muvos before it, this one went belly-up after about 4 months. It won't power on, my computer won't recognize it in order to format it, and even the magical hard-reset procedure which has resurrected it several times already during its short life couldn't bring it back to life.So, it's into the trash with the dead Muvo, and on to search for a better MP3 player. I'd avoid this one if I were you!"
1,Not a great buy,"I received the Nomad Muvo 64 MB MP3 player for Christmas. It was really small and light, which was wonderful. The fact that it broke 4 weeks later was not so great. Even when it was working, it would cut out occasionally. The idea behind the design is good...it slides apart to easily connect to your USB port. The sound quality was amazing when it worked. However, the poor reliability of the player just ruins all the other good features. I don't recommend this particular product."
1,undependable,"I was disapointed in the quality and controls. The USB connection worked great, It did not need any drivers or installation to work under XP, but the unit stopped working after a few months and had to be sent back to Creative for repairs. the repairs cost as much as a new player so why bother."
1,Defective,"Bought one today at J&R Music World. It does not work, windows XP do not recognise it as a removable device. I am very upset..."
1,Bad Quality Product,I will reiterate what so many others have and I hope Creative Labs will read this: I purchased this unit 3 weeks ago at CompUSa. After one week the play button stopped working so I took it back toCompUsa and they replaced it with another one. Guess What? It stopped working too after only a week of playing it. This thing is a piece of crap. I'm left with a glorified floppy unit and not an MP3 player.
1,not good,I didn't like this MP3 player at all. It worked wll until 3 months later. I was shocked! Don't get this if u don't want to waste money.
2,Smart Design--poor quality,"I bought this unit because my son confiscated my Samsung YEPP, and I was attracted to the dual use as a USB storage device. This is a very good idea, and packaged in a nice sized case. The problem is that like other reviewers, my MuVo died after the second day. I was listening to a song, and paused the player midway through the song. It never came back on. I bought my unit from Dell, and they were great in sending out a replacement, but after reading these reviews, I am not so sure I want to deal with this again.Creative really did come up with a great idea, they just need to follow up and make it not only cute, but dependable."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","Purchased this unit about 4 months ago and it has stopped working. Like the previous reviewer, i can also use the memory stick portion of the unit when its plugged into my USB port, but cannot get it to play any files when attached to the battery pack.I called creative support and recieved no help at all since the warranty for these units is a paltry 3 months. Apparantly Creative Labs is aware that these units are poorly made and break quickly, which is why they dont bother to warranty their work.Save your money and purchase a unit from a company that actually cares about the quality of their work."
4,A good MP3 player,"I bougth my Muvo MP3 Player a few months after it came out and still own and use it. It's pretty durable, I've dropped it several times and it still works. I use it everday to listen to music as well as transfer files. It's also very easy to use. You just drag and drop the songs that you want, and it's played in order that you copied it, even though it list it alphabetically. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lock function as well as having to start from the beginning when you stop playing it."
1,Send MuVo Back to the Design Lab,"My MuVo died a premature death after an hour of use. Simply stopped working and had to be returned. Creative Labs ""support"" for this product was unresponsive-- no help from the live technical Rep or e-mail support. [Weak] customer support for troubleshooting product which can only mean that the product has known out-of-box first use issues and when it's DOA it stays that way. Flimsy design and obvious commodity quality and/or firmware issues prevent the MuVo from achieving it's potential. In short, poorly executed product with horrible support from Creative Labs-- Recommend you buy something else from someone else who better understands how to design, manufacture and support consumer audio electronics."
3,Silly,"Both funny and ridiculous. Anyone who likes Eddie Murphy will not be disappointed, he is as funny as usual. The silliest part in the film is when the chick is fighting and she happens to get wet, so the rest of the scene is basically a wet T-shirt show because she (of course) is not wearing a bra. I mostly liked the movie because parts of it were actually filmed in Nepal, where I have spent some time, and it was nostalgic to see it again. Some very visually appealing scenes and an interesting plot dispite being a bit nonsensical. The actual golden child is cute and captivating."
5,The golden child,This is one of my husband's favorite movies so i picked this up for him.I don't care for this movie and thought it was boring but the kids loved it so four out of five people in my family loved it thats why i gave it five stars.
3,Not the strongest Archer,"Lew Archer is hired by a troubled couple to get a painting back that had been stolen from them. The painting may or may not be genuine and was painted by an artist who may or may not be dead. Add an addicted daughter, an earnest young man, an aged beauty, a drunken father and a strange cult and you have an Archer mystery.One of the Archer strengths is the way he draws complex characters, rather than complex plots. One of the weaknesses of this book is that the vice is versa. This is one of the most complex Archer plots that I have read. Without the bulk of pages to fill it out, the characters are correspondingly weaker.This is not to say that it lacks entertainment value nor that there are not high points (the character of Fred is noteworthy). This is simply to sayt that there are better Macdonald novels out there."
4,Not as Pictured,"I'm happy with the fuel pump, but it does not have the electrical male connections (the two prongs) shown in the photo. If you still have the original female connection on your vehicle, like I did (and would have fit perfectly with the male connections in the photo), you will have to cut them off and use the connections that come in the box with the pump. It's not hard to do and as long as you have a crimping tool you should be fine."
1,What a disappointment,"I couldn't agree with these reviews more. Had an Optima Red Top and after about 2 1/2 years it couldn't start the car if it was sitting for over a week. Replaced it, but unfortunately couldn't get a full warranty because I lost track of the exact date of purchase. Well I got a new prorated one, but the same thing is happening. If the car sits for any period, good luck. For this price I would expect great performance, not worse than mediocre."
1,"Worst battery ever, period.","I have had 3 Optima redtops in the last year and they are the worst batteys ever. Ever single one dies after a week of the car sitting. The shop says there is no slow drain. An ammeter show no draw. Disconnect the battery and let it sit for a sit for a week and it still dies. There is an issue with their batteries. To top it off, Optima changed their product number so it cannot be exchanged at the reseller for another redtop or upgrade to a yellow top.. . an extra crappy point to make is that I had a 3 year old riding lawn mower battery sitting on the shelf. I slapped it in the car as an emergency fix and I've been running it for a month and a half no problem.[.....]"
5,Elfangor's Secret --- second best of all four Megamorphs,"I thought Megamorphs #3: Elfangor's Secret was very well planned out by the author, and it is also well-written though it's very confusing. I thought Visser Four was very well- decribed. I just wonder: In Elfangor's Secret, meeting a new visser was a big thing for the Animorphs, and in #46 The Deception, when they meet Visser Two, it isn't a major thing nor is it well- decribed. But when we meet Visser Four, it's far more exciting then when we finally meet Visser Two. The book itself revolves around the discovery of the Time Matrix, a dangerous device that can alter time. It is capable of destroying everything the Animorphs have ever known. So when the Animorphs journey through time to go after Visser Four from using the Matrix to alter time , strange things are happening. History is being altered by the visser, and the Animorphs are in a race against time to stop him. But their stopping Visser Two comes with a deadly price...."
3,sort of a kids version of lensmen or null-A?,"These are an entertaining series of books for kids.This one is about going into the past and making sureit is different in a bad way.The five friends and their alien friend go into the pastin several places: Henry V fights the French, Washington crosses the Deleware,Lord Nelson fights the French fleet at Trafalgar, Einstein at Princetonand finally D day.The controlled Visser Four uses the Time matrixto go back and change the past:friends find out because they experience what theirpresent is like as a result of his changes:slavery, and political intolerance.By two super-beings ( like the Q in Star Trek)they get the chance to defeat the Visser Fourcontrolled human John Berryman.The result is a story with a lot of action and changing scenes.Some history may be learned by the reader?i kind of liked the book, but dislike the series."
1,"K A, what the hell?","I'm sorry to admit that this book is seriously bodgy. Travel back in time, trying to prevent an evil megalomaniac from changing the course of history? Never heard that one before. Plus nothing of note really happens (except for major characters dying, which doesn't count because Applegate always follows the rules and brings them back to life). Tobias and Rachel have their second kiss, if that counts...although in this context I would suspect it is emotional manipulation on the part of the author, trying to keep us with her.Oh, and Cassie? 'Sorcieres' is not a word most people learn in their first term of French (especially if they get a B).Honestly, if you've got an absolute dearth of activities for an hour and a half, and there is only one Animorphs around, and this is it, this is the only situation in which I would recommend this book. Save your money."
2,Vertical stretching in widescreen mode,"In fullscreen mode, this is a great player. MP3 playback is also pretty good, although it would be nice if it could read mp3 tags, instead of just the first eight characters of the filename.The real problem I've found is that the player I bought shows noticable video stretching when playing a widescreen DVD. Everything just looks a little too thin - stretched vertically. At first I thought it might just be a particular DVD, but I've tried four different titles and gotten the same effect. I'm going to return this one and spend the extra money for either a Sony or Toshiba, where I know I won't have to worry about video quality..."
3,Lilah: A Novel,"My cousin's reading group at her synagogue read this book, she recommended it, and I read it on my Kindle. The writing was ok, but I enjoyed the story and found some of its twists and turns most unexpected. Talk about the differences your choices can make. I am thinking about reading the other books in the trilogy because of my pleasant surprise from LILAH."
4,Value for Money,"I bought this DVD because I wanted a DVD player with out all the gimmicks, that is easy to use and was value for money.This model lived up to my expectations. It came with two remotes, one that does everything and one for the technicaly inept that just plays the DVD's.It is progressive scan; if we ever upgrade the TV set to HDTV, we will not have to get another DVD player. It can also be hooked up to speakers for surround sound. Speaker cables are not provided but are readily available."
3,a cool vid,"this video is great! this has the best close-up jessie bannon, in questworld, shots of all the shows. ^_^ i suggest any fan of jonny quest to buy this video. get your copy TODAY!!"
3,I am disappointed,"I know Cecil for several years.I am using it together with Harrison for the last 20 years.I bought the 22nd edition with the web version.It looks wonderful, but....Try and compare the chapter on hyponatremia and compare it to Harrison. Try and find Carbamazepine on the list of drugs causing hyponatremia...you cannot find it in Cecil (but it is in Harrison and in the ""current"").What about amiodarone and hyperthyroidsm? It is hardly mentioned in Cecil, and well described in Harrison (and in good old ""current"").So, let's wait to the new edition of Harrison."
1,the textbook of medicine,"The publishing year that I coulnt see when I purchased n the differenr writers for the books when I typed the title and the writers of the book. I was dissapointed at this book. I woul not ordwr it if I knew the year of the publishing. I did review for this book already n the seller contacted me and scared me too for the way he or she wrote.It this same thing happen again, I would not buy any from amazon."
4,Good and elegant book,It is a good book with useful tips and tricks.the authors use an elegant way to catch the target.
5,YOU WON'T GET TOO MANY NIGHTS LIKE THIS AGAIN!!!,"This was truly one 'Red Hot' night with B.B. King & Friends that includes golden moments with: Albert King, Etta James, Eric Clapton, Gladys Knight & Stevie Ray Vaughan just to name a few. The surprise here is that you find ALL of these Friends in a relax setting that really sets the mood. The bad and sad part is that this has yet to see the light on DVD, so in the meantime this is worth seeking out and firing up your old VHS machine."
1,A Totally Useless Guide to Kent,"This so-called ""guide,"" which purports to contain ""hidden"" places of Kent, as well as maps, is a ripoff. There is absolutely nothing in the guide that cannot be found in more conventional guides to Kent. In fact, the other guides contain much more information. As for the ""maps,"" they are tiny, dark and cannot be read even with a magnifying glass. The maps also contain numerous red symbols, but there is nothing explaining what such symbols symbolize.In the US, there are guides to the states entitled, ""Off the Beaten Path,"" and they are very informative. They contain odd museums, haunted houses and other places of interest for those inclined toward the unusual. I, mistakenly, believed England's ""Hidden"" series was similar. I was wrong!"
5,buying one more.,"Ive had this machine for two weeks now and am buying another as a gift. it plays MP3s well,and ofcourse dvds. Its more technologicly advanced than i am so far i just put the dvd into it and press play. thats all you have to do. It comes with rca cables, which allows it to be connected to most tvs. It has an optical output, which my tv cannot utilize. but i can and do use the component outputs which enhances picture quality. check your tv if you have red,green,and blue jacks adjacent one and other you could take advantage of its advanced picture quality as well. The component cables are inexspensive at amazon (8.00)."
1,"DOA, quality is obviously sporadic",I took a risk with the mixed reviews and the player that arrived today failed to play several disks and would error out shortly after the two times I got it to start playing at all. I'm returning the unit for a refund.
2,Compact but problematic,"It is a very nice compact unit, tailor for anyone with a busy life or the economical college student. However, the overheating of the unit is a huge problem."
4,"Not the best, not the worst","I've had this player for 6 months and not had any problems AT ALL. I feel I've already got my money's worth. I mean for $40, what more can you ask for than it playing everytime, never skipping, never freezing, NEVER overheating. It doesn't have all the ridiculous features that a $200 Sony does, but how often do you use automatic frame locking. (This is where you can program it to pause on a certain scene) Who needs that? Anyway, for the one blaming Amazon. You're stupid if you don't buy from Amazon anymore because of your experience with this player. Who knows what your daughter did to it within the two weeks she had it. Amazon can't be responsible for that. The manufacturer should be, and would if you would just contact them and keep on it. To that reviewer, you're an idiot!"
1,DVD player did not last...,"I purchased this DVD player as a gift for my daughter. It was very nice looking and compact. After a couple of months she started having problems with it, DVDs would not load or play at times and then it finally quit working in less than a year. Either the one I bought was faulty or it is not a good product, not sure which is the case."
1,Uhhhhghhh.,"Did you love the old Slim Man? End of the Rainbow? Secret Rendezvous? Jazzified?I did.Well, I don't know what happened between those and this, but, it is not the same Slim Man.I was very disappointed. I could barely listen to it - some tracks are so embarrassingly bad I skipped to ""next"" - sour sax, off key vocals, no soul. Nothing moved me.Come on, Slim Man, get back to where you once were!A former fan, wanting more of that Original Slim Man magic.This doesn't cut it."
2,"Not his best, but Slim is The Man","I am Slim Man's #1 fan without a doubt. I've seen him several times live in concert and have every one of his CDs under the Slim Man name and under the Bona Fide (no vocals) name and they all are great...except for this one. But, even he knows that. At one of his concerts someone requested a song from this CD and Slim said ""oh, so you're the 1 that brought this CD."" Which tells me that even he knows it was a stretch. However I love the title track ""For Now and Forever"" it's a wonderful love song and could be a great song at a wedding. All I ask is for those of you who only have this Slim Man CD, I ask that you try his CD Bella Mia, Jazzified or Secret Rendezvouz. I'm 100% certain that you will become a Slim Fan like me. Thanks."
1,Not what I expected,"The book begins very well, great concepts and examples of how copicating has been always used for smart people to create or increase wealth, but it takes a turn for the worse when turns into propaganda for franchising and NETWORK MARKETING, the author translates the whole concept into Amway and McD.I mean there are nothing wrong with that, actually they are very succesfull companies, but I personally dont think those are the best way to become wealthy."
3,Silver not gold,"This us a god quality collar, but the picture makes it hard to see the color. It's silver, it gold. The traditional color for fur savers is gold. As long as that doesn't matter, this is a good price and good collar."
3,"Great story, not so great writing","This book was recommended to me by a coworker who thought the lessons of the life-long impact of an incident, and how they dealt with it, on two different people would be applicable to some of my own life events. The recommendation was a solid one, and I appreciated learning about (I can't say more because I never knew about ""the punch"" until I read the book) ""the punch"" and how Tomjanovich and Washington dealt with not only the physical aftermath of the incident, but also the emotional and mental aftermath.The lesson is easy, if not predictable, but having it play out as you read it and realizing two men really experienced this helps to make the lesson more applicable.I was less impressed with the writing, which I felt needed a good editor. Major stories were repeated and quotes were often reused."
3,father of twins,Somewhat disappointing the 2nd night we used this tent one of the poles snapped with no extra pressure on it. Only saving grace was that it stayed up for the rest of our trip. It is nice and roomy and fit 2 pak in plays and a queen sized air mattress no problem.
1,not a good deal,"This tent is not as big as it shows, the main room is too small for two queen size mattresses and the first time camping the over the door flap bar broke. Third time camping one of the poles in the middle of the tent also broke so its really a useless piece of crap unless we can get new poles to replace any that break and it leaks in a rain storm. It says 3 room but its not big enough for 3 rooms or 7 people unless they are little children not adults. I wouldnt recommend this tent to anyone."
3,Picture is somewhat misleading,"The advertisement is somewhat misleading. It says it is 10' x 18'. And it shows the front of the tent. However, the tent base is not a rectangle. The front is 18', and the tent base is sort of an offset pentagon. It only has 116 square feet. I should have caught that in the description near the bottom of the page, but I didn't.My old tent is 10' x 18' tent that I bought from Sams Club years ago, and it looks very much in the front like this tent does. It is 180 square feet. And I was expecting the same in this purchase.Kudos to Amazon's return policy however. I'm returning it, and I'll pick something else out."
3,Not what I thought,"The tent looked great and was a snap to put up, but the rooms are small. My son who is 6'2"" needed 2 rooms."
5,"""Condo"" Tent",I spent the last 15 years backpacking and looking down my nose at car campers. THEN I had two kids 18 months and 4 1/2. I now appreciate the TRUE value of having seperate rooms (still waiting for tent-sound proofing technology) and the ability to stand up and change. If you are car-camping with kids THIS is the tent!!!!Dave
2,Don't expect all the features to work the way you want...,"At first glance, this unit looks pretty good for the price.However:1. Chroma-bug is present in progressive scan mode.2. Memory stick port doesn't support 128MB sticks - only 64mb or less. No where is this limitation mentioned - I had to go to Samsung.com to find out the bad news.3. Regular DVD playback mode distorts DVDs with a letterbox aspect ratio - it stretches the playback vertically. While most folks may not notice this, it is still annoying to have small black bars at the top and bottom during playback yet have the image stretched and vertically distorted."
5,Ms. Shara L. Bouie,"My personal review on the Samung Progressive Scan would be the mulit-cabliblites of the pro- scan DVD from Screen to DVD. The over all clarity of the progressive scan is next to the top ten next with the Sony DVD and Video Progressive-Scan, and the Philips. Although, the following questions of it's mulit-usage, maybe , How would this product work with my entertainment system quailty and or Is this product able to be used with my pc or audio system?&quot; Yes, to both the Audio and Visual question being that during the actual connection process is so simple a child could program the Samsung Progressive Scan. In closing wether dealing with a simple digital camera to the a Kitchen Mixer , I rate from personal usage of this product at the highest a 10.Thank YouShara L. BouieAtlanta, Ga"
4,Economical DVD player to have.,"Wanted to purchase a progressive scan DVD player and settled on this one because of the great price. Bought it middle of February and have had no problems with it so far. Picture quality is great, easy install, able to play all DVD's and CD's in my collection so far, including burned CD's. I haven't been able to test out the memory stick capabilities yet but nice option to have. If you are in the market for progressive scan DVD under $..., I would recommend this one. It's sleek, compact and easy to hook up. The main remote is a little clunky with the toggle selector but a minor design flaw."
1,Limited volume control,"Thought this was going to be a great deal for the price....it has very limited volume control. Lowest setting is too quiet, next setting up is too loud. Also, no radio presets. Not worth the money spent, will be returning to store...."
1,Broke with Just One Day of Use,"This hammock was large enough for my 13lb cat who loved it and hopped-in right away. But, with only about 24hrs of use, one of the strings broke. Fortunately my kitty wasn't sleeping when it broke and was just trying to get settled-in. If he would have been sleeping that would have definitely been dangerous. I could fix that one string, but I just don't trust it enough. I'll probably just cut off the strings and use it as a blanket for my kitty instead."
4,"Indifferent plot, a fabulous set piece on western squalor","When I first saw Scorched, I had the same lackluster response to it as most of the other reviewers. I fully expected to forget it utterly, and was quite surprised to find that my thoughts kept returning to it. Eventually I was motivated to see it again and find out why, and the second time through I figured it out.While the movie does only a tolerable job of telling a funny story and holding the viewer's attention, it delivers a devastatingly accurate rendition of the cultural wasteland that is the California-Arizona desert.In the same way that Lost in Translation so exquisitely captures the feeling of working abroad on your own, Scorched captures the utterly sublime squalor of small desert towns. The setting is squalid, the things that happen in the plot are squalid, and above all, the characters are so delicisouly squalid.Taken as a portrait rather than a story, this movie is a masterpiece."
2,worth a watch,the movie was ok...i had to purchase it on Woody Harrelson principal. the man can do no wrong...it is worth a watch
4,Delightfully evil,"I was attracted to this novel because of how much I enjoyed another Masterton novel that referenced a children's book:Spirit, which referenced ""The Snow Queen"" as a major plot device.In MIRROR, the children's book with which it is so connected is Lewis Carroll's THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. There's more to ""Jabberwocky"" than just silly words, my friends!In MIRROR, a frustrated writer is obsessed with a murdered child star, and he gets possession of the mirror that was in the room when the child was killed and chopped into bits. And apparently his spirit is in the mirror . . . and that's just the beginning.Great Masterton. Lots of evil stuff. Enjoy!"
4,New Orleans Funk,"Being a kid from New Orleans and growing up listening to New Orleans music, I had missed hearing the early recordings of Mac Rebennack on local ""oldie Stations"". When you grow up with this music, it's like a drop of fresh rain to hear it again after so many years. This album is a tribute to the man now known as ""Dr John the Night Tripper"",Check out ""Storm Warning"", the long version, and the fabulous ""Foolish Little Girl"" a classic, may the ""Night Tripper""cruise forever."
3,Not much new in here.,"I was a little disappointed in this book. The tales are REALLY short and I've previously heard the majority of them. As another reviewer posted, to a non-pilot this is probably a pretty funny book, but for a pilot, it's mainly a collection of yarns we've all already heard at the airport.The only way I would recommend it was as a bathroom reader since it's easy to read 1 or 2 pages and stop. This one may get donated to the local library in the near future."
4,Almost too smart for a runner,"Maybe I'm being too simplistic in this review, but I was looking for something different than I found in this book. It was however true to its name. If you are looking for answers with their origins in nature to why we run and how we can look at animals for cues to how we might perform better, then this book is for you.I found some interesting trivia, and enjoyed learning a some science behind why I may naturally driven to run, but in my current phase of my life I want to read about how this world class ultra runner cover those 100K in just over six and a half hours. That is what I was truly looking for. While I got my race fix at the end of this book, I was left bogged down in the middle reading what felt like a text book during the middle sections of the book.If you are looking for a Dean Karnazes type of book then pass this one up, but if you are looking for some science along the way pick this one up for your collection."
1,"Not satisfied, waste of time","The author or the Ghost is very articulate in presenting the ""biography"" and it was interesting read to start with. A few chapters into the book the author claims how he and the guys on his track team idolized the running greats of the 70s such as Prefontaine, Shorter,... This didn't make much sense as the author already had mentioned about his childhood just after the WWII and being youngster in Maine growing up and taking up to running. Then he mentions about going to graduate school in 1966!!! Obviously he was a grown up in 60s yet mentions about idolizing the running greats of 70s as a youngster. That was it for me, didn't want to waste any more time."
1,Very slow; terrible CD player,"If you're looking for a multiple DVD/CD player, do yourself a favor and buy a higher quality unit than this one. First of all, it's very, very slow when loading or changing disks. Also, it will not automatically switch disks without programming it. If you put in 5 cds and expect it to play all five in a row, you will be disappointed. So it makes a terrible CD player. My 15 year old JVC CD player is 20 times as fast at reading a disc and going to a particular song. Plus, the toggle thing on my remote works only about half the time. The picture and sound quality are fine, but the damn thing won't even display how much time is left on a cut or a disc. You've been warned..."
2,"Youth Mania, Watery Cocktail","This is a dull, cliched Disco-euphoric youth rom com, acted by 30 to 40 year olds who try way too hard to look westernized and euphorized. It reminds me vaguely of other disco-abroad-Bollies such as Salam Namasté or Hum Tum (both also with Saif Ali Khan who is too old for such fluff and performed so much better in Omkara, for instance). Stupid plot. Bland disco music by Pritam who delivered much better tunes (easy rock) for the Anurag Basu movies Barfi! and Life in a Metro.Master lenser Anil Mehta did a great job, again. The leading ladies look gorgeous (too bad that after Om Shanti Om, Deepika Padukone seems to choose only bad roles in bad movies). The old hands Dimple Kapadia and Boman Iran do give this watery cocktail a bit of substance."
2,"Very British, Perhaps Too Angry","The problem I had with this book was that the characters were depressing. Helen, the mother seemed very unloving to her daughter Jo. The only thing that they really did was argue. Peter who marries Helen is even more repulsive in this story. And what is it with the story of the daughter imitating her mother's life by getting pregnant, despite her life situation. It seems that the arguments between the mother and daughter play for the most irritating part of the story. Only parts where Jo is having her first love affair with a black sailor, and the friendship she has with Geof made this story seem not as angry as it would really seem. In all, the story is all banter. If you can handle a lot of arguing, this play might be readable for you."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!,"My twin daughters both bought one of these. Each failed in the same way before the warranty period was over. However, Sanyo makes it impossible to make a warranty claim. Do not buy this camera, or anything else from Sanyo, unless you like throwing money away."
1,Postive Parenting with a Plan,"I would like a refund as I never received the product. It has been over one month since I ordered it. I contacted the seller and after finally getting back to me, she said she mailed it via MediaNet on March 26th. I am extremely dissappointed. I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company as I was charged for the book.Sincerely,Unhappy Customer."

5,Time Saver,The Karcher K-12 cleans my brick side walks and patios better than I hoped for.It even cleaned moss build up 4 to 5 times faster than using a power sprayer without the K-12. This attachment provides a powerful wide cleaning area and does not require alot of effort to use.
3,"A decent intro to Eno, but lacks the man himself","While watching this earnest doc about the legendary Brian Eno I wondered why the filmmakers were unable to interview the man himself. They clearly had access to the foremost experts on Eno, but Eno is seen only once in interview, and of his many collaborators only the most obscure sat for interviews (no Bowie, no Byrne). So, while much of the information shared seems accurate enough, I can't help but think that it was a missed opportunity to get new insight into his working methods and philosophy. That said, if you're new to Eno and don't want to read the various books about him and his music, this film offers a fairly concise portrait of him during his most protean period and relies heavily on the insights of the authors of those books."
4,Magnificent works of art,"Fantastic book, naturally laden with fascinating history. The photos of the paintings are outstanding. The text is very clear and describes most of the paintings. This is not your typical (display) coffeetable book, but you actually love reading and enjoying this great book."
2,Audiophile? Videophile?,"Sometimes you bought a DVD hoping a great sound.Sometimens you ger some DVD hoping a great hi rez image.In this one I hope for both and I didn't get none.Boring, easy listening, fully marketing oriented.The image is too lighting.Forget about it."
2,Soundtrack is upsampled redbook (CD quality but no better),"The videos and music are restricted to two of the three CDs. The third is just filler. The videos are marginally entertaining, once.The alleged 24-bit, 96 kHz music, which was the main reason why I bought this, turns out to be nothing more than up-sampled 44.1 kHz tracks. The rest is devoid of any signal. In other words, it is essentially fraudulent labeling.If two 1 hour CD quality audio/video archives is all you want, then you will be happy.I sure hope most of my money went mainly to the Bridge School. In retrospect, I wish I had just cut them a check and skipped this DVD."
3,Fair...,Besides The Who and Pearl Jam all of the other versions are mediocre! I thought I would like the other versions but they are dull.
1,Purchase at your own pearl.,Garbage.Video - 4:3 (concert disks)Audio - 2.0 PCMLot's of old clips from the 80's and 90's. You can imagine the quality transfer from those old video tapes. These 'clip's are like what you see on late night TV. The value for today's market is zero.Made it through Pearl Jam (2010) still 4:3 and 2.0 PCM - this title sucks.
3,GET EM' GOIN,"A spark for something new must come from somewhere, but when they lit the fire they didn't expect to burn the whole place down! These guys out of Louisville, Kentucky seem to set the scene on fire no matter where they go. Bringing some dope beats, and there own style HBE seems to touch the characteristic youngsta trying to make it. I feel the albulm it does have some hot tracks like ""Big Body"" and ""DagNabit"". If you havn't at least listened to the albulm I would give it a try, you might just find yourself Bobbing Your Head.Homie"
3,"Not motivated, just pretty okay...","Young Jeezy album is not bad at all. The beats are bangin' and the man really has some decent mic skills. He does'nt have to many guest appearances and holds the album down by himself.My only gripe and reason I rated it so low is as a concious man, a father, and the fact I like balance-this album blows. This man talks about selling dope like it's the promise land. And any street cat or person who has did or been around the game knows this is not true. It's cool to be real wit what you have done but don't sell that bullsh@t dream to these youngsters. We got enough problems in the community and whether he likes it or not he is influential. Be real but be responsible. Hotep!!"
1,"Buy if you want some good laughs, this guy must be a comedian.","Is he really trying to be tuff? Well, he turns out to be funny as hell. He calls himself snowman, stretches his ""yeeeahs"", ""thaat's riights"", ""ayys"" for at least ten seconds in every song + he's probably the slowest mc ever. I think he sounds a bit like Ludacris every now and then, jeezy's voice is just more raspier and has no talent at all.This, tony yayo's, mike jones's, fifty's albums are definitely top four worst rap albums of the year 2005. But I think he deserves 1 star for making me laugh. Don't take this ""funny rapper"" too seriously. I don't own this album but I've heard friend playing some of these songs."
2,Why the Hype?,"I bought this album cause u in the USA has gone crazy about this dude.And what do I get?A rapper with an incredibly slow flow, and below mediocore lyrics. The beats may be of some quality but I had a hard time separate teh songs from each other; they all sounded alike. Some guest spots is decent: Young Buck and Hova. But his constant over use of: Yeah!! and That's right!! made me wanna kill him.Don't buy this."
3,Annoying as F***,"To be honest I actually like Young Jeezy, back then when he was still in Boyz N Da Hood but now he is as annoying as Fran Drescher laughing. But I only lke about 3 songs and they still manage to annoy me like hell.The Only Good Songs1.Soul Survivor feat. Akon2.Go Crazy3.And Then What feat. Mannie FreshThe thing that annoys me is what he does every f***in songYeeeeeaaaaahHaa HaaaLets GeteeeaahhhTHATS RIGHT!Basically repeating things he has already said(like Mike Jones). You should take My advice and just burn it or just add those 3 songs I've enlisted to your MP3's or Computers."
1,Another Thug with a record deal.,This album sucks to bad it defies words.....AVOID!Young Jeezy...lol thats enough of a warning.
1,This guy is WAY over rated,"I am from DC and my job had me re-locate to Nashville TN. So of course everyone is big on the southern rappers out here. Nothing wrong with that other than most southern rappers are garbage (not being an a$$ just telling the truth). Everyone seems to be raving about Young Jeezy, saying he's the next greatest, so I listened to the cd out of curiousity, man do I regret that. Dude is just another dime a dozen rapper with a barely average flow and tired production. His lyrical content is pretty weak, rap about something more productive than how much of a street hustler you WERE. You're on one of the biggest rap labels in the industry, and you're a product of it. I'm sick of seeing those stupid snow man t-shirts, that's setting a good example for the young & impressionable. I'll just go ahead and chalk this one up as another disappointment from Def Jam... Hey Def Jam, how about releasing the new Red Man or that ODB cd that still has yet to see the light of day?The Zapper"
1,Young Jeezy or Lil Weezy Wannabeezy,"First of all, this is the best example of unoriginal rap sh....that is being categorized as hip hop these days. Okay, this is what were gonna do buddy, how about you come with that southern flow because thats where the money's at, talk about selling crack and killing people, but throw in some weak ass metaphors so you kinda sound like lil wayne cause he's hot right now. Oh yeah and your name should be ""Young Jeezy"", pretty cool and trendy, huh. Man we really need to save hip hop, stop buying these talentless garbage rappers."
4,Wow... It's even better than I thought it would be,"4.5 stars.I was looking forward to this album after hearing the Trap or Die mixtape, and that Boyz in the Hood album. Jeezy has got the same buzz around Atlanta T.I. had before I'm Serious came out.The album doesn't dissapoint at all, Jeezy really brings it. It's very consistent from beginnig to end, with great production and Jeezy spitting memorable rhymes. Surprisingly, he doesn't get outdone by any of the guest rappers on the album even though most of them (TI, Trick Daddy, Young Buck, Bun-B) are heavyweights in the game. That alone shows this cat has potential to be great. Except for Bang & And then what, the beats are really laid back.My favorite song is Go Crazy. Also, I really like And Then What, Last of a dying breed, My Hood, Trap star, Bang, Trap or die, and Air forces. Standing Ovation is the only track i routinely skip over."
5,Very comprehensive and well-organized text,"Dr. Beck has done a great job with this text. She discusses everything from structuring the first session to identifying, evaluating, and responding to feelings, thoughts, and beliefs to various assignments and treatment planning. She even addresses relapse prevention and how to tackle various problems in therapy. This book is a great resource, particularly for those new to cognitive therapy. It is also useful, however, as a refresher for those of us who have been practicing awhile."
5,CBT STATE-OF-THE-ART,"Hundreds of books about CBT exists, this one is unique.A top reference in the field. Probably one of the best book available on the subject, and most than probably a major one. Aaron Beck daughter have write a superb comprehensive, clear,and practical CBT manual. In my opinion, this is one of ""THE"" book everybody can recommand without a slightest hesitation."
4,A dark and dreamy collection..,"I enjoyed this album most while sitting in my ""purple room""...the place in my house where I go for peace and quiet, reflection...My favorite cuts are ""Haunted Melody"", ""Dreamland"" and ""Deep in Icing"", as well as the wonderfully moody instrumental piece ""Lucia"". I could have gone for one or two more up-tempo tunes, but I don't think that's what this album is all about. More about setting a reflective, sensual mood, like a Sade' album."
2,Disappointing,"I concur with several of the other reviewers that while his stories reflect a remarkable adventure, they are conveyed with a tone of negativity that is off-putting. The reader is left with a sense that Mr. Jones approached his journey from the perspective that he was the only person on earth who understands it. Rather than a personal odyssey, during which one would presume to learn about the world and make discoveries about life, this journey felt more like a personal war against it. We are to believe that during his amazing journey, Mr. Jones personally conquered bureaucracy, the ocean, militant people, racists, and everything else that is wrong with the world. His attitudes toward nearly everyone he encountered were consistently negative -- as though he was running some gauntlet of ignorance that only he could survive. I believe I've read my last Tristan Jones book."
3,NOT THAT BAD ONCE YOU GET IN TO IT,"THIS BOOK IS NOT THAT BAD AT ALL ONCE YOU GET INTO IT.THE BOOK IS SET IN THE 1930'SYOU HAVE LITA A STRONG YOUNG GIRL WHO WORKS HER...

1,Voyage to the Begining of the World,"I was very dissapointed, the Title of this movie, is very misleading, watching the center stripe from the rearviev window of a car is not my idea of Entertainment."
2,ok,ok with it got purple as showed on pic the only thing that sucks it isn't sturdy needs more support ferret loves it and is having fun with it don't think it's going to last long though don't know unless you try it
1,terrible,"do not buy. waste of money. you get a tiny amount, and i wrapped the hell out of a garden hose coupling, even tried it twice, with no success. still leaks. so, don't expect a miracle."
4,None,this is an extremely good book. I would absoloutly recoomend but it is priced outrageously for a kids book. Otherwise I love it. Brian Jaques is very good at fantasy novels. Redwall is his best series and one of my favorite book collection of all timeBryce bowman.
2,The Item that I recieved sucked,"I recieved this Itme and it was supposed to be brand new but when i opened it it hade fingerprints, scratches, a spill like from a liquid Do not buy this new"
5,A Welcome Surprise,"As most of us who have been reading the Redwall series for a while think, ever since the book Marlfox, the quality of the books have gone down a bit. It's apparent that Brian Jacques was writing for a younger audience (the dibbun humor, and the humor in general), and his books mainly follow the same plotline: A few friends go on an adventure, one of them carrying Martin's sword, magically learning how to use it like a pro without any previous training. Loamhedge was a nice change from that story line. It's also his best coming of age story yet! I think BJ is coming out of his slump, and I cannot wait for his next book, Rackety Tam. Keep it up, Brian!!! ^_^"
1,Color is not necessarily white,"Note that while the color of the cable in the photo is white, that isn't necessarily what will arrive. Mine just came today and it is gray. In focusing more on the content of the advertisement, nowhere was white specified, but I needed white, so this is a bit of a disappointment."
3,"good reference book, easy reading, very knowledgable",This book was extremely well written and brought up some very interesting points. It was a great resource material.
3,Not as much germination as hoped.,"It's years too early to see how they taste, but only about half of the roots I planted sprouted."
2,Lost in Sam's Town,"All the songs on the album, except for When You Were Young, are a drag. It sounds like the songs were written on the fly. What happened to the melodies and retro synth sounds from Hot Fuss?! (I really liked that album.) I am not sure what direction The Killers were/are headed---I think they got lost in Sam's Town. To answer ""we hope you enjoyed your stay"" in track 12.... Not really. Sorry."
4,Pleasant surprise...,"After listening to the album for a week or so prior going to their show in Denver, CO, I must say I was a bit skeptical. Hot Fuss was great but the new album didn't seem to live up to the debut. Watching their horrendous appearance on SNL and MTV, I was prepared to eat my hard earned cash and expect a bad show. Fortunately, the show was the best I've seen in quite some time, and the live performances kill the studio versions making this album so much more enjoyable to listen to. I can definitely tell what they were aiming for in this album's sound, it's a shame they couldn't capture all of the experience on this album. Definitely check out their show."
2,NOT SO GOOD...,"I BOUGHT THIS CD 'CAUSE I LOVED THEIR FIRST ALBUM, HOT FUSS.YOU'LL FIND 3, MAYBE 4 GOOD SONGS IN THIS ALBUM. I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY, 'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT."
2,Please...don't patronize...,"Don't flatter these boys. There are about 3 catchy songs....the rest may have as well been recorded in a bathroom.Let's just say their record producer worked wonders on ""Hot Fuss""...and oh god...watching the lead singer try to sing on Saturday Night Live was extremely painful....what a dissapointment..."
2,The Killers need to go back to Vegas,"I had to listen to this one several times before making up my mind. The Killers have shown a new face, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't connect with their old face at all. In Hot Fuss, the songs were great and the melodies easy to pick out and sing along with. In Sam's Town, Flowers can't seem to find his own melody. His pitches are all over the map and they don't seem to blend with what the rest of the band is doing. It is a unique style that might be okay for one or two tracks, but a whole CD? The Killers have indeed lost their 'Killers' edge, and I hope it comes back for round three. Definitely preview it before you buy it, or you'll be upset at throwing away 15 bucks. I'm just glad I got away only paying $10. Whew!"
2,Suck Town,"Did the Killers forget how to write a hook? ""When You Were Young"" is the only listenable song on here. Get it off itunes and forget you ever wanted to visit Sam's Town."
3,It has good moments,"I waited until now to finally buy this because I'd heard such bad reviews. Not to mention, Brandon Flowers had given an interview before it was released proclaiming Sam's Town as the best album in the last 20 years. Quite a statement to make, and Sam's Town doesn't even make the top 200 of the past 20 years. The vocal styling is downright annoying at times and the songs are over the top. The Killers seem to take themselves too seriously, and they might be able to get away with it if the songs were better. It's not all bad - there are a few good tracks (Read My Mind, My List, For Reasons Unknown, When You Were Young). But it is largely a disappointment cosidering what Mr. Flowers built it up to be."
2,Dissapointing...,"After the dust has settled from the hype of Sam's Town's innitial release, it is unfortunately dissapointing. After such a brilliant debut cd, the killers appear to hit a sophmore slump. The first single When You Were Young sounds like reminance of Hot Fuss and similiar to Mr. Brightside. Definitely the stand out track on the album, Bones and Bling are decent songs but the depth drops off after that. Not only are the riffs and rythems dismal, the vocals and lyrics are not up to par to Hot Fuss. It feels as though they rushed this album by trying to ride the wave of their debut. The Killers need to put some more time into their next album, rather than produce such dribble every two years."
3,great writer bad story,The story is well writen but just down right borring i could not read 2 pages with out falling asleep and the ending was a big let down
4,lives up to its title,"Very cool keyboard sounds, space-like and out-of-this world at times. This isn't as strong as ""Victims of the Modern Age"", but it has some strong tracks, my favorites being ""High Moon"" and ""the Eye of Ra"". ""Starchild is an epic piece, and overall the album has a nice mix of melody, crunch, good drumming, interesting vocals, and epic keyboards."
2,So Disappointed,"Mists of Avalon is one of my favorite books and I waited a while before I treated myself to Firebrand. Unfortunately it does not compare and was very disappointing. The storytelling is reasonably well done but the characters are one dimensional and over-used stereotypes. I also agree with other reviews that the portrayl, more like idealization, of women throughout the book is based on 20th century feminist ideals and further weakens the impact of the book."
5,I always thought this would make a great movie...,"Go ahead and read the reviews below. But if you were intrigued by the recent made-for-cable movie retelling the story of Troy's fall from Helen's perspective, you will love this book, told through the eyes of a richly conceived character: Kassandra, the doomed daughter of King Priam. I can only hope that the makers of the upcoming ""Troy"" movie take a page or two from this retelling...I personally would love to see Brad Pitt's Akhilles fall as he does in ""The Firebrand""! As always, MZB manages to turn one of the most traditionally testosterone-driven tales in history into a female-centered but no less thrilling page-turner. Give it a try before you go to the theaters or TV!"
4,Great sound for the price,"I have the original 600 not the 600II but most features and performance are the same. Decided on the JBL after listening to a lot of home theater systems in the under $1000 price range. Bought mine refurbished from an authorized dealer so it had same warranty as a new one. The remote is a little confusing but the sound is great! It replaced my old larger system with Bose 901s so I wasn't sure I'd be happy but I am. Only problem with DVD played has been a few hesitations when playing enhanced widescreen DVDs but 99% of the time, no problems. Small speakers were a consideration and the 100 watt powered sub is more than adequate for home theater in a medium sized room. I think the model II may use an active sub powered from the receiver, so I don't know if that makes a difference. Had it two months and so far I am very pleased."
1,don't waste your time or money,"First off, this system is $300 cheaper at Best Buy. Even at $500, this system is NOT worth it. It has troubles reading enhanced CDs, it won't play MP3's, the bass is very sloppy, there is NO midrange sound, and it is far from user friendly."
4,Louisian Lou a Western Story,"I enjoyed reading this book. It showed some action which many westerns I have read lately fail to do much of. To busy explaining in detail the landscape right down to how many pedals a flower has or what the pebbles look like. Give me a good fist fight, maybe a gun fight, sweep the gal off her feet after making her mad and some hard riding to make it interesting."
1,HORRIBLE,"KID ROCK IS VERY BAD BUT HIS NEW SONG FOREVER IS SO FUNNY, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY A VERY BAD WAY. WHEN HE SAYS ""I MAKE PUNK ROCK AND I MIX IT WITH THE HIP-HOP"" THAT IS SO FUNNY. HOW COULD THIS GUY POSSIBLY THINK HE IS PUNK ROCK. IF YOU WANT PUNK ROCK LISTEN TO SOMETHING LIKE THE RAMONES. AVOID THIS ALBUM."
3,Eh,Kid Rock get's annoying quickly. I don't think this album is bad. But how many times can you listen to it? Average music.
2,wrong listing,"listed under southern rock well one song was,i really liked that one but you can keep the rest"
1,too bad about the lyrics,"I like Kid Rock, but his music has terrible language. Songs like ""Only God Knows Why and Picture are my two favorite songs with good lyrics and I personnally would like to hear more of these songs. I am a country bumpkin if ya know what I mean.Otherwise best wishes in the music industry."
1,One Of The Worst,"Usually I'm open to all kinds of music, but this is just plain bad. I thought it couldn' get worse than Limp Bizkit, but this rivals it in a big way!!! You've heard the hip-hop lyric cliche's before, you know, like I'm the biggest, the baddest, I sell the most records, etc. This time its slow, boring country with some really bad rapping. I can't believe some call this metal, as its really not even a rock album, no pun intended!! Avoid at all costs."
4,"Good, but this might not be what you expected from Rock","We all know that Kid Rock is both an in-your-face rocker and a laid back kind of guy. Well this follow-up to ""THE HISTORY OF ROCK"" illustrates Rock's more casual care-free side. I loved both ""DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE"" and ""THE HISTORY OF ROCK"", and I like this album as well. However, this album contains tracks that are much more somber than previous Rock classics such as ""Early Mornin' Stoned ...."" or "".... You Blind"". Yet tracks like ""Forever"" show that Rock can still be the cocky (no pun intended) rocker we have come to know and love. When buying this album, you must realize that you aren't going to get the same .... you kind of songs. I wouldn't say that Kid has turned mainstream with this album, just more reflective. Overall, a great album and no music library should be without it."
3,what happened?,"this album was alright. I was kind of dissapointed though in a way. why? there's too many slow songs. at least half of the album is slow. i wanted something I could rock to or just blast. with this CD, there's no way.My personal favorites are ... Trucker Anthem / Forever / Cocky / You Never Met A MFer Quite Like Me / I'm Wrong, But You Ain't Right / I'm A Dog / WCSR""Devil Without A Cause"" is by far the better album."
5,Motor City Pimpin!,"Motor City Pimp does it again. The Kid represents the ""D"" to the fullest by bringing back good ole' boy rock n' roll with the twist of hip hop. The CD has something for everyone, regardless of what type of music you like. The duet with Sheryl Crow could go but other than that it's tight. Snoop Dogg and the Stone Cold Pimp put the grand finale on this american badass classic. This CD will make you cruise gratiot up to Romeo and wax the booty."
3,Lonely Road of Faith Won Me Over,"Not sure what this type of music is called, it's not my usual preference, but the beautiful song Lonely Road of Faith won me over, so I bought the CD. There are a few others I like and those I don't, I can skip"
3,Sub-Par,"This is no ""Devil Without a Cause,"" and it bums me out. Like others posting reviews, I think there are probably two KR songs on this album that resemble his best work from DWAC. The rest seems like bad country filler, particularly the dreadful duet with Sheryl Crow. I hope that Mr. Rock wakes up soon and reverts back to the music he claims in many songs to be the master of making."
3,kid rock and kazzer,"I'm not here to review an album, I'm here to tell you from a kid rock fan's perspective that if you like kid rock: you will love kazzer. KAZZER, remember it when you are listening to the radio and hear his name, he's definitely the next biggest thing. He's like kid rock minus abit of the country, because hes got a DJ and a backing rock band but he doesnt sing, he raps. SO remember the name! and remember i told you so!"
1,"1 star, thanks to Sheryl Crow","This CD is complete junk. It's not only junk, it's BORING junk. I have never had a rock cd put me to sleep. Kid Rock needs to go home to his trailer and hang up his guitar, he has absolutely NO talent. If it weren't Sheryl Crow singing on this CD, I would have given it ZERO stars. Don't get me wrong, I loved Devil w/ a Cause but I think he used up all his talent on that CD, he's washed up and has no new material left in him. I'm A Dog is probably the worst song on this CD, it [is just bad]! UGH! I hate this CD and plan on throwing it away now, unless you want it. :)"
1,Please...,"...somebody put him out of our misery. Obviously Kid Rock's album sales have given him the impression that he has the talent to match. Sadly, he has karaoke vocal chops at best. Please, Kid, accept the fact that you are the product of a successful marketing campaign and leave it at that. And please, stop doing duets with singers who can actually sing - I'd like to listen to them without cringing at you."
1,What a Joke,"Words cannot describe how horrible this CD is. This jimmy stopped trying after Devil Without a Cause. This guy is such a..., he thinks he is a bad SOB because he sold some records. Listening to him ramble on about how great he is just pisses me off. You are a damn fool if you buy this CD or his last one. We need to get rid of this joker, it would be a lot easier if MTV wasn't shoving him down your throats. If you want good music buy yourself any Tool CD, I promise you it will be the greatest decision you will ever make."
2,Please try harder next time Kid!,"Kid Rock said he didn't make this album for anyone but himself and it shows! After playing Devil Without a Cause for 6 months non-stop and with The History of Rock also getting heavy play, I figured this album would be awesome. However, I was wrong. I want my money back. The CD is boring, the songs are trite. I know Kid is famous for his ""pimp"" style and lyrics, but 3 CD's of the same old (stuff)is enough. Yeah, ""Forever"" is catchy, but it ends about there. The duet with Cheryl Crowe is pretty good, but that's it... just get ""Forever"" as a single. If Kid keeps this up he won't be around much longer, let alone ""forever."""
1,WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"How can you say someone writes, plays and sings their own songs on an album FILLED with nothing but samples from and outright rip offs of other peoples' music?!Trust me folks. This is FAR from being the salvation of true rock and roll."
3,Receiver Problems,"I have had the same problem three different times.Sent the unit back to Koss,it was returned and was fine.After 3 months,same problem arose.After about 3 months,same problem.I will have to send back to Koss again for repair/replacement.The problem is:Soundfields do not switch when the ""mode"" button is pushed on the remote.It stays on ""stereo"" and cannot be changed. This only happens when in ""tuner""[radio] mode.Other than that,I like the system for the price,and Koss's service is excellent."
1,Nice Little Budget System? HA!,"I've read all of the reviews, and while I can see both sides of the coin, be aware that sure ""it's a nice little budget system"" IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO REPLACE IT NEXT YEAR. If you want to spend $220 PER year on a home entertainment system, that's fine. After purchasing the system and being told by customer service after 10 months ""send us $200 and we'll send you a new unit"" rather than offering any type of repair - I'll shop elsewhere for my system. In this instance, you get what you pay for."
3,Plucky Repetition in Flat Repose,"I returned this. It sounded interesting on the soundbytes- made me want to hear more- contemplative I hoped, kaleidoscoping simple strings with great moments but it doesn't change enough or bring emotions from me deeply or passionately. There were no climaxes. It's very repetitive and drawn out. The titles and picture are pretty but I didn't feel much of Finland or transported anywhere but perhaps to be more careful in the sensibility to try for other cultures' music to know them better and enjoy. I was intrigued, then bored and annoyed- and the marketplace seller got annoyed and arrogant towards me for returning it. I think the things titled for are more interesting, alive, and spirited than evocated. Maybe as far as zithers go, it's expert technically but it seemed too much one pace also, like a Japanese instrument never slowed enough to appreciate."
1,Save your money and use your head,"Of course, if you have no common sense or will power, the book might help a little. Overall, I found it ridiculously boring.It is always amusing to me that one reads someone else's book for advice on how to help oneself. I don't get it... it is supposed to be self help, right?"
3,Bluebirds aren't sure about it,The Bluebirds take the nuggets at times and not at others. This may because their feeding the young. I will continue to try useing them to see if the trend changes. The Titmice do like them but it also draws them to the meal worms.
4,"Great writing, flavorful instrumentation, a true artist.","I own both of Brad's CD's. The beautiful soothing tenderness of 'eureka' and harder-edged 'Mud'. I was told there was no guitar on 'eureka'. I went home, threw it on, and the first thing I heard was what I thought was a guitar. To my surprise it was not a guitar but a piccolo bass. I had never heard this instrument. This adds a new texture and excitement to the arrangements, which in and of themselves are fantastic and well thought out. I would suggest either of Brad's two recordings. On top of being a brilliant writer and multi-instrumentalist, Brad is a great engineer and producer. If possible check out Jeff Howell (Florida) or Mark Hayes (Cali). The recordings are better than some of the major label recordings I've heard. Brad knows his medium without being excessive or pretentious."
3,It's ok,"I use it to wash the house and reach the upper story. Yes it isn't industrial strength and it does takes some oomph to put it together and take it apart. But I've used it several times over the last several years and it has lasted and worked fine. It allows me to avoid using anything but a step ladder to clean the siding and windows. If you are careful and not prone to using each and every section, I typically leave it assembled when using and storing, it should be fine. I use an 8' step ladder and do the lower story without the extention and the upper story with."
1,Very Disappointing!,"I got this to show my 8th graders. It mentions that it has professional actors portraying the famous characters. This is just a film of black and white, blurry photographs. No actors. I am sending this back. For middle school students, this would be a complete snooze-fest."
3,Its not what I expected,"When I read the dimensions of the box in the details I thought it would fit my deck of tarot cards. But the inner dimensions are MUCH smaller. My tarot cards dont fit at all. There is also a chip in the front engraving. The craftsmanship is not what I was hoping for. But it looks like a sturdy little box and I'm going to keep it. There was a strange smell when I opened the package. It smells like the stain they used on the wood, nothing disgusting. I wouldn't recommend this. I'm going to have to look for something else for my tarot cards."
2,"Would not recommend, yucky.","The box arrived w/what looked like mold/water damage all along the exterior. It also smelled unpleasant. Being that it was a Christmas gift I had no time to return it, so I sanded it down & cleaned it up. It was usable after a fair amount of reconstructive effort. Beyond that it is a pretty box & a tight but perfect fit for the standard set of tarot cards."
1,Dry and Boring,This was a bad book because the characters were to swashbuckling. It was boring and everyone I know hated it.
2,Quality Is Doubtable,A few years ago I bought a full room of JBL speakers from center to subwoofer. All worked perfectly for few years(I am not the daily users of the system but once a week at most) until one day I heard disturbing noise from the subwoofer even before I turned on the receiver. I readjusted the receiver and the subwoofer as well as replaced the connection cable but all did not help. Now I have to find a different one for replacement. This time I will not do with JBL.
3,good ideas but wirtten in a hurry,"The book has a basically good plot and the characters are really brought to life, but it's written in an extremely simple, poor, sometimes even boring style. Very black-and-white, superficial, and that's a pity because it could have been a far better book with some more care and time."
5,A WONDERFULLY SUPERB BOOK!,"Steel is at her best again. Faye is a woman with five children all of who are extremley different from one another.Her husband seems to take off everytime a problem arises.Faye is determined to love her children unconditionally even when she learns that her oldest son is gay. This book will take you through the ups and downs of life and how this family deals with their problems. It teaches you a lesson about life, not to give up when the going gets tough.So sit back and enjoy your ride."
3,Not a bad read,"If you are new to DS books, this is one of her better ones. The writing quality is fair. Stick to her early books... don't bother with anything she wrote after the mid-1990s. Her writing style became ridiculously repetitive and boring and the plots nonexistent. The early books have more intricate plots and characters that she actually bothered to develop.This book does have repetitive phrases (yes, we get it that the women are beautiful). She gives her readers very little credit and finds it necessary to tell us that certain characters are good and some are bad. She does this in every book, so it may get old. She should let us decide for ourselves whose side we want to be on. But, you can definitely relax and enjoy the book without having to think too much. She put a lot of effort into the details and the characters (especially the children) are interesting."
1,don't buy this,"It worked great, for about 8 months. Everything you'd want it to be, for an out-of-the-box system. Then it started overheating and stopped reading dvds. Then it stopped reading dvds entirely. I am told that Koss won't even repair it if you send it back to them, and the parts are seemingly unavailable to do it yourself. Do yourself a favor and buy something that will last."
3,A great key organizer; but not a safe.,"I asked for this on my Amazon wish list, and received it as a gift this past Christmas. It is very functional and does exactly what a key organizer should. It included five different color key tags, and was straight forward to hang up. It works well for this purpose.However, if you are planning to use this as a key safe, you should be aware that it is easy to remove this from the wall without the use of washers or something similar to prevent someone from just sliding the box up, and then removing it from the wall hangers. Additionally, even when locked, it takes no real effort to just pull the door open and access the keys inside.I wanted this to keep spare keys organized and in a single location - for this purpose, it is an excellent choice."
3,Not a safe only good for storing keys in a organized way.,"This product has a atractive finish, ok lock and key and looks well when hanged on the wall.A lot of keys can be stored and labeled.Not a safe only good for storing keys in a organized way."
5,Good Quality for the price.,You can pay more for lesser quality. This item includes 25 plastic key identifiers while most others do not. Pretty Good!
2,"A melodrama, not a swashbuckling adventure","The book is a melodrama. The first part consists of the main character wanting to marry a 17 year old girl but her brother objects. Lots of talking. Very little action. A duel is almost literally described as ""in a few minutes it was over"". The second part consists of a woman urging her husband to dislike the main character. Scene after seen of this.If you just read the plot it reads like a swashbuckling adventure. But the book expands the drama scenes and barely mentions any action. It is well written if you like melodrama. The characters are not all that deep but they are well written and distinct."
2,same old,Mainstream and tired plot. Some eye candy but that's about as exciting as it gets. Just seems like a lot of gay movies these days feature the same kind of story over and over again and the eating out series is no exception. Although I don't think I'll watch the sequels.
2,"Long shipping, item doesn't work.","It took 2 weeks to ship, which I find pretty long, and it didn't even work. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to go through the whole returning process. Oh well."
3,No Salt Cookbook,The book met expectation. It presented a variety of tasty dishes to try. I have made several of the soup/chili dishes and they turned out good.Darrell Brandenburg
3,animal collective-lite,"I bought this album after hearing their song ""the knife"" online. If every song on the album was that good, this would be a 5 star review. I just wish that yellow house brought more crescendo and release to an often too stable yet still pretty sound. Almost four stars."
4,totally surprising,"The most immediate effect of listening to this CD for the first time is surprise. The rhythms on all songs are not traditionally Ethiopian, but closer to American R&B from the 50's and 60's. Even a traditional singer like Ayalew Mesfin joins with a funky song. Girma Beyene is a complete original, borrowing very little from his own roots. Lemma Demissaw sound best to my ears. I feel he is very comfortable with the American R&B and sounds real ""cool"". His songs are the high point of the CD. All songs by Alemayehu Eshete display his R&B style - very successfully. This is not authentic Ethiopian Music, but it is good Ethiopian music and I recommand it to lovers of this genre."
2,The Pill (should be tilted: The Fail),"I watched this movie, not as good as I pictured. There were some hilarious scene away from the main characters, my favorite Mindy's family and her ex-boyfriend scene. Overall the film would have been much shorter with a condom :)"
3,"Poor, poor Ruth","This is one of the saddest books I've ever read. It tells the story of Ruth a young woman who has recently been widowed. It details the way she deals with grief, the torment, and depression that follows such a loss.Alone with her thoughts, and the material objects left from a short marriage, Ruth has to try and reclaim her life, this time without Ben.It contains lots of prose describing many things, the woods, the countryside around, but I was left wanting slightly more.If you don't need a tissue while you read this book, then you didn't cry when you first watched Bambi!"
5,Symphonic rock at its best,"One of the best albums I've ever heard. The band has creativity, performance is exceptional. ""Nightwish"" is very much underestimated by the general audience - unfortunately. Very high standard - whether you call it ""symphonic"" or ""female fronted"" - it's just top quality music."
5,Wonderful TV for 5 years,"Contrary to what some of the others have said in this forum, I've had this tv for 5 years and never (thats right) had any problems with it. I've moved it 3 times and never have I had an issue. The HDTV looks amazing, The gaming looks unreal. The response time is lightning fast. I love this tv and plan on keeping it for years to come. I still use it in the increasingly fast tv market. after 5 years the only thing I wish it had was a HDMI hook up. The DVI, however looks just about as good. Great TV.Like any forum, only the dissatisfied customers usually write reviews. I'm here to voice the other side...for all the happy customers that will not review."
1,Not worth .02$ waste!,"I own one and every single Panasonic PT-50LC13 has a defective ballast that overpowers the bulbs. We received 1500$ for warranty to buy new flatscreen luckily, but it was originally 3,000$. I've replaced the bulbs with 4-5 oem new panasonic bulbs and even tried generic ones, but they always die very quickly especially when kids or guests switch the T.V. on and off before the 45 min cool down period! So don't buy from anyone who is trying to sell you this load of junk."
1,Easily the Worst TV Ever!,"Bought this in 2003. Within the first year, blew a bulb and required a new optical engine. (The optical engine is the heart if the TV-set and will cost about $2k+). After that it was a new bulb every 9 mo.+, at $300 a lamp. Thank God for the extended service contract!Finally, in 2007 the ballast went out. After two mo.+ no ballast repair/replacement available. Ultimately, and after some haggling, the extended service contract basically refunded the initial purchase price for the TV.I have moved on since. Lesson learned: never another Panasonic TV in my living room...P.S.: Without an extended warranty on a, at that time, $4k purchase, I'd be severly ""unhappy"". Thank God, the extended warranty came thru all the way!"
2,Wait to Buy this!!!!,"My tv was delivered 30 days ago and it has already broken!!! The bulb, which is suppossed to last 10,000 hours, has gone out. My husband did some research on-line and found lots of people complaining about this problem. The authorized repair facility is trying to find out from Panasonic if it's a problem with the bulb or a deeper problem with the tv. The picture is great and I would like to rate this a 5, but a $2700 tv that breaks after 30 days qualifies for a low score. In all fairness, I will update this once the problem is resolved. I just think we should have waited a year or two for them to resolve all issues before purchasing this item.We ended up exchanging the tv because Panasonic couldn't give us a time frame on the bulb. The new one has been in place for a week and my husband is in love again. I'm reserving judgement for 30 days."
2,Constant bulb problems,"We've had this TV for less than two years and we just blew out the second bulb on it! At a cost of approx. $300 each, you would think they could figure out how to keep this from happening. Now I'm on hold to order the second one and the projected wait time is 60 minutes! Althought it does have some really cool features like being able to play video games on one side while still being to watch tv on the other, I still wish we would have never purchased this tv."
4,I love my TV but,"I really do love my Panasonic 50 inch projection LCD TV. I use all the connections except the DVI (3 video, 4 component, both RGB, and coax). But, I purchased it in September of 2003 with an extended four year warranty. The light bulb blew out after 3 months. The replacement bulb lasted 17 months before it blew out. The warranty program has covered the blub and replacement, but each time the TV is picked up and returned to the shop for repair. As I write this I am waiting for the TV to be returned to me.I hope the newer bulbs have a longer life as the current cost for the bulb is $300.00, and I want to keep this TV long after the extended warranty runs out."
3,Curiosity killed the Bubbler,"It worked great for one of my cats, he's content to drink his bubbly. The other cat didn't want it on, and we were unable to keep her from tugging at and biting the tubes that come from it, or playing with the little vibrating thingummajig. Needless to say, though I cannot find any holes or disconnected parts anywhere, it just doesn't work anymore. I'm now looking for one that has the motor concealed, and no tubing that she can get at. My poor other cat still tries to stick his paws in the water to coax some bubbles out, to no avail."
2,So noisy,"This bubbler was so noisy and it scares my dog so she wont even cross in front of it. I had to put it away same day I got it because it made her tremble.It might be fine for a larger, more agressive dog."
4,the bubbler,"My cat took a few days to warm up to the idea of drinking from a bubbling water dish but now likes it. My goal was to keep him out of the sink and tub... that hasn't worked completely, but I've seen an improvement. The knob that adjusts the level of the bubbling doesn't work too well so the bubbles are very small and too few. This is fine for my cat but others may want more."
4,Easy to refill and clean,"Nice dispenser, easy to clean and refill. A little louder than I thought it would be. My kitten wasn't as keen on it as I thought she would be since she loves moving water, but she has adjusted well (after chewing the air tube in half!) It still works fine even with a shortened air tube!"
2,Expected Better Quality :(,"I was hopeful that this product would serve its purpose but it gave out within two months of the day I purchased it. I used it outside and the weather didn't cause it to deffect. The pump quit working and I didn't keep it running 24/7. I turned it on for a few hours each day. I thought the price was good but since it didn't last very long, I would not recommend it."
3,"It works, but overpriced","The concept is great. It took a couple days for my cats to get used to (they were a little afraid of the bubbles at first, so it was nice that I can adjust the bubbling level). But they're drinking from it now, and I'm glad to have fresh water for them all the time.But my beef is, it is overpriced. The first one I bought was broken (cheap plastic). I had to take apart the second one to get it to work. And I discovered it is nothing more than an overpriced aquarium bubbler. Unless you're looking for something with a large reservoir, just buy your own pump and secure it to the bowl."
1,Unreadable,"I purchased this book given its low price. Unfortunately any price for this book is too high. It includes a disclaimer before the title page about the frequency of typos in the text. Heed their warning! The format renders the book impossible to read; paragraphs are often split, and capitalization mistakes are ubiquitous. I am literally going to throw this book out and find another copy. Also, the footnotes are made indistinguishable from the text proper making it really confusing to read."
3,High hopes dashed by brief delivery of title topic,"I had high hopes for this book. I was ready for something completely dedicated to teaching me everything I needed to know about creating a site without using a single table tag for layout. Although the book does explain how to do this, I was still disappointed. After a brief introduction about CSS (yet again), section two of the book explains how to create layouts without using tables. In all, seventy pages of 500 are centered on this topic. Half the book is a CSS reference. The other sections talk about fonts, colors, etc. Clearly, the book is mis-titled. This remains a good book for someone new to CSS, so they can avoid bad habits from the start."
2,Useless as a Reference,"I purchased this book hoping to use it as a reference to solve various CSS issues that crop. Unfortunately the various chapters don't show how to actually use any of the knowledge its supposed to impart. For example, it'll show an example, and then display various extra code that it says should be ""added"" to the page. Added where? At the top? Bottom? Inserted inside a DIV tag? Which one?I can understand a book not having any concrete examples if its going to concentrate on the subject at a conceptual level, but it doesn't explain the concepts either. For example, in the section on positioning it doesn't say more than ""absolute"" means absolute, and ""relative"" means relative. That's nice, but doesn't leave me understanding any more how to actually design a page than I did before reading the chapter."
2,Extrememly deceptive title...,"This book should have been titled something like ""CSS and CSS 2 Introduction"". It has almost NOTHING to do with using CSS instead of tables. In fact, it's only covered in one portion of the book, and just barely touched on. Further, it gives little to no practical methods of using CSS instead of tables. In a book such as this you'd expect to see examples of layouts that would normally use tables and then step by step guides on how to make it CSS. Not so.This book is a good overview of CSS, a TERRIBLE book on using CSS instead of tables."
1,An unforgivable waste of my time and money,"I found this book to be unprofessional and boring. I could use other words to describe it but they wouldn't be fit for a public website like this. The main characters were unbelievable and pathetic. The plot was ridiculous. I only finished it to prove to myself that the ending would be equally unsatisfying. Yet again I am disappointed by so called bestselling authors. I have only read this one book by John Case, and it would take a lot of convincing and bribery for me to read any more."
4,Well done presentations,"This is a series of informative presentations with each one going into the things you would see (excellent Blu-ray), the history, and culture of the area. Well worth the purchase and time to watch. Why 4 stars, not 5? Seems 5 stars are reserved for BBC productions."
3,black/white illustration,"The book is an excellent introduction to the first alphabetically ordered encyclopedia. I cannot add more to amazon's detailed descriptions except that all the 850 illustrations are in black and white. The only place you can see any color reproduction of the manuscript is on the dust jacket. For me, it is a major flaw. Color reproduction is a must for presenting any beautiful illuminated manuscripts."
3,Not up to Ellroy's best,"This early serial killer book has some intriguing aspects but is lacking when it comes to plot and scenic structure. It sort of plods along and the somewhat interesting main character isn't enought to sustain a reader's enthusiasm. There isn't much tension in the plot. Everything seems somewhat predictable and the outcome inevitable.Mostly, fans of Ellroy's L.A. series will miss the manic pace, the full cast of characters and the complexity of scene and mood. This book is too much of a piece. Limited and ultimately hollow."
4,Very Very Dark,"Okay, so it starts really well, then slows up a bit with all of the early exposition, apart from the fact that you cannot (hopefuly ever) relate to his reasons for killing or where they stem from, the book really picks up about halfway through, and like all Ellroy novels, it's worth reading just for the ending. Oh, the ending is damn chilling"
1,wrong product?,This is not a studio... what do I need a POSTER for? I thought I was ordering a DVD. A waste of $7.00.
1,Beyond the Pale Story Indeed.,So how did this get published? If you have a clue please let me know. This one is possibly the worst book on vampires I have ever had the misfortune to try to read.My vote is the person responsible for publishing is is a closet suspensionofdisbeliefphiliac.
3,Super Reader,"A covert government agency makes a vampire woman an offer she can't refuse. Work for them, or don't do anything ever again.They have some terrorists to stop, and her superhuman abilities will be needed.She also has a problem in that after causing a serious problem for Byron, she has been celibate for a century or so. So, of course the first guy she meets and finally shags turns out to be a vampire hunter.Apart from the bad guys she eventually gets the better of, it turns out her mother is involved with a secret group of super vampire agents called Team Darkwing. A bit annoyed by this revelation, she can't be too mad given they helped her out."
2,The secondary characters were more likable,"I didn't buy the instant love between the main characters Henry Ann and Tom Dolan. They had no restraint, didn' even try hard at all to do the right thing, which was to keep their hands and mouths off each other. Afterall, he was a married man with a very mentally ill wife. They really didn't care what was right, they selfishly went along with their desires. I was very disappointed in them. I did like the secondary characters, Henry Ann's half brother Johnny, Grant (the bum who turns out to be a Harvard educated lawyer), and the best friend Karen. In fact, I would much rather have read about Grant and Karen's lives and their romance."
5,"First, but certainly not last!","This was my first Garlick book, but believe me, it will not be my last. I would have to put her up there with Nora Roberts! A beautiful story in a time when it would be very difficult to find anything beautiful. Yes, the story of the wife is very sad, but I really could not find fault with the husband, Tom. Very good summer reading!"
1,Big disappointment,"The JBL speakers did not perform anywhere close to my expectations. Given then they are bookshelf speakers I was not expecting concert hall quality, but they produced a tinny sound with weak top and bottom ranges. The old speakers they were to replace were far superior. I returned them the next day.I had always been pleased with JBL products, but these speakers do not meet the traditional standards of JBL products."
3,No Examples,"This text has a thorough introduction to topology, especially as it is related to analysis. With several exercises (complete with solutions for the Dover edition), this text provides good practice and forces the reader to work out some of the main ideas. However, as stated in the book's preface it is lacking in examples. Even with the plethora of exercises, the lack of examples in the text makes the book quite dense. The book essentially becomes theorem, proof, theorem, proof etc. without reprieve which becomes difficult to read after not too long. I am planning to use this book along with Munkres' which I checked out from the library. It seems like this combination should be helpful."
5,A Wonderful Book,I highly recommend this book as a supplement to another topology text since it has a lot of hints and answers. Students may not learn very from it because they may just copy the answers in the back of the text. It is a great book though.
2,faerie music,"While I am a great fan of Robin Huw Bowen on the Welsh triple harp, this album disappoints. Crasdant appears to eschew any depth of feeling or drive that I associate with good Celtic music. The absence of bass tends to give the music a busy, spritely feel which I have dubbed ""faerie music"". Reminiscent of sessions, the pieces have a repetitive and unimaginative feel which leads one to wonder why noone bothered to make thoughtful arrangements. Mr. Bowen can do better than this and his associates, excellent musicians all, should rally to produce a more varied and unique sound."
4,"Was worth the wait, but....","I really enjoyed the latest of the Wilf Brim saga. However, he could have done more with it. There was an entire section wasted on dribble (spoilers!). And the editing was horrible. I hope a reputable publisher picks this up and polishes it up a bit. I also hope Mr Baldwin tries to finish the saga."
4,A four star album,"A lush and melodic dub album. A four star album. If you are interested in dub music, there are far worse places to start. Pablo throws around a lot of ideas and really succeeds in his ventures, into spare rhythmic numbers, and into fusions that sound like precursors to funk and even modern styles of rnb and hip hop. The volume and echo effects are fine studio touches, if you're into such details of dub music. They add a variation, i daresay, a dimension, to the rhythm of a song. And the recording sounds great (except one of the later tracks). Sample the mp3s somewhere and pick it up. This music should be heard by many more people."
4,"Great Book, But . . .","The book and its photos are great. However, Brian Shul is not well-thought of in the Habu community. I don't know if I can buy a book by a person that broke all the rules, and now acts like he is a hero. One of the most incriminating photos is a self-portrait of Shul, with his David Clark pressure suit and helmet, taken DURING a mission. From what I have learned about the ""Sled,"" the pilot was too busy to be snapping photos of himself--especially in a super-secret airplane, during a classified mission."
5,Get a front seat perspective of the Sled,"This book would be worth the money for the pictures alone. It is easy to understand why Brian Shul owns a photo studio these days. As an added bonus, Brian tells a fascinating story of what life is like for the front seat driver of the Sled. I can hardly wait to get his 2nd book, The Untouchables."
3,Bad olives...,"This item would be a very cute gift, but the olives are covered in mold. The top of the jar is disgusting. If you want it for yourself, then it is cute, but no good as a gift."
1,I like to drink my coffee hot!!!,"Hello,Just wanted to express how unhappy I am with this purchase. I was actually really exited obout the product details and the looks of it. What a dissapointment that was! They are really big and don't keep the liquids hot at all. I make my coffee every morning for my son and I, and it takes me just about ten minutes to get to my work from my house, and by the time I get to work to have my first sip of coffee...the coffee is a just not even hot. So, overall, I am very very upset with this purchase. Do not recommend this product at all. I can not ever say that I can return the product because one of the mugs is alredy broken.Thank you,"
4,Good,"i got these mainly b/c they are dishwasher safe and my other travel mugs got ruined in the dishwasher. the only thing you have to be careful of, is the seal inside the lid, the dishwasher can sometimes loosen it so you need to make sure it's in there good before locking the lid on, i'm sure the seal will need to be replaced eventually, but you can get them on here or it's the same size as a magic bullet seal. if the seal was more permanently in the lid i'd have given these a 5 star review"
3,Image Unrelated,"The couple shown is metal, but the one I received was plastic. It is a little misleading the one I got works and does the job it is after all just a few wire contacts, but I did pay extra believing I would receive a heavy duty metal couple."
2,"I finished the book, but barely","The first few pages read like the fast-paced prose I expect from these types of books. But the momentum quickly fades. I continually wondered if the writer simply got bored and wasn't will to invest the hard work needed to create several hundred pages equal to those first. The book does a whole lot of ""telling"" and very little ""showing."" It is thin on scenes and action and instead offers a litany of summarizations. I only finished the thing because Ungar's life, no matter how it is rendered, captivates.There is very little artful story telling in this book. I am surprised Mcmanus endorsed it. He had do have done so with reservations as the man understands writing.A good editor would have pushed this work further. It's a lackluster telling of a riveting life.The research seems solid, and the book is better than nothing. But it was a definite let-down."
4,Intriguing,Good biography. I youre a degenerate gambler it's a must read!Always interesting to read life stories about people who live in the fast lane.
5,Highly Recommended!,"Although I tend to be wary of self-help books, I found this book extremely helpful and insightful. After reading the reviews that criticize his emphasis on prayer and meditation, I just have to say try it yourself and find out how powerful it is. I can see how some people can be put off by some of the terminology he uses like ""love tanks"" and ""love vitamins"". But, given that the information is ultimately so insightful and useful, it should be given a chance. I have no problem giving Mr. Gray my money for this book considering how much I've gotten out of it in just a couple of weeks. I've recommended it to several friends already and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for personal success and happiness(just about everyone!)."
2,Save your money,"I gave this book two stars because the pages didn't fall out. If they had, one page more than would have covered all of the important or worthy advice this book had to offer. I felt that I was reading the same paragraph over and over, reworded a bit so it would pertain to the chapter title. When I got to the part about filling my love tanks, I wanted to throw the book in the trash but decided to tough it out. I skimmed the balance of the book trying to find something worthwhile, but to no avail. Perhaps Oprah should start reading the books she pushes. If you want to learn how to appreciate yourself, good and bad, try The Dark Side of the Light Chasers. Unless you like drivel about your love tanks."
1,how to fail at life in one easy lesson,"This is a very good advise book on how to live the life that has been so great for Mr. Gray. Personally, I do not strive to live as a monk or throw away my marrage. This book contained nothing new that I didn't learn in Jr. High Health and Relationships class."
1,PSYCHOBABBLE GOBBLE-DI-GOOK!!,A Book like this is what is wrong with America in the 90s. Soccer moms should love this.
5,A Handbook for Everyone,"This not your usual ""do-it-yourself"" book with a glib formula to solve serious problems in human relationships.It is rather a guide and handbook which reflects the personal and professional experiences of a wise and compassionate therapist.It presents a philosophy of treatment and an innovative but practical program for those of us who have suffered emotional abuse in family life,career or community (i.e.all of us).Written in a clear and thought-provoking style,it is free of excessive psychological verbiage.I urge you to buy it,read it,study it,and use it!"
1,not an outdoor clock,This model is appanently the same as the cheaper WT-3181P. The instructions say it can only be used outdoors if protected from rain and above 41 degrees. Its 27 outside right now. I guess it might be O.K. in southern Arizona. Amazon needs to add this important note to its product description.
5,better than expectation,"it worked immediately, it picked up the atomic clock signal and quickly adjusted to the correct time. it is a great size, easy to read face"
4,Nice clock ... good price,This is a very nice outdoor clock. It keeps good time and is easy to see from anywhere on our back porch. I found this same clock at a local home improvement store for nearly $15 more. The price at Amazon was the reason I purchased it here. I am happy with the clock and recommend purchase if you have a place you can locate it where is is somewhat sheltered from the elements.
3,Automatic clock setting doesn't work,Ehe main reason I brought this. Clock was for the auto set function. Forget it doesn't work from day 1
5,great product,"work like a charm, took few minutes to get the radio signal and set the clock right! The 18"" display is so easy to read from far away. The battery compartment is seal with a plastic cover for weather proof."
5,"Good looking, easy to use","Got this so I could tell what time it was while swimming in the pool. for the $40 I paid it is a great product. Solid/heavy and easy to read from across the yard. I put the batteries in, hung it up and 30 minutes later it was set to the WWDC time. Piece of cake!"
3,Doolittle Did A Lot,"Doolittle accomplished so much in his life that it's hard for the reader to keep it all sorted out. I found it interesting reading up until the WWII episodes. He did just about everything there was to be done, aviation-wise, until his retirement. After that, it's pretty much a dry listing of his service on various corporate boards and with various organizations and the receiving of various awards, etc."
1,Are These Guys That Clueless? Arrived Broken,"I thought after all the complaints..they would at least ship these decently. No way. Small box with a hole in it, both ends half open and a smashed casserole dish. No where on the shipping box were the words FRAGILE, GLASS, THIS SIDE UP...either. It is really a cute gift, bright and happy. I don't know about the quality. I didn't dare break the cellophane seal. I'm trying one more time, and if they are still clueless that this is a breakable item, I'll get a refund. MH"
2,not a good book to get started with...,I didn't find this book particularly good for a beginner. I would recommend starting with a New York Post version to get familiar with Sudoku and try this book later. I'm still in the NYP book and am enjoying it a lot. The NYP ones are written by Wayne Gould.
3,It's okay,"These so far okay, nothing spectacular. I've already thrown one away because it lost the audio."
1,Very Poor Quality Tapes.,"I have used hundreds of recordable vhs tapes in 2 different vhs cassette recorders that I have.I have never had a problem with any of them, ever...Until I tried using these. Out of 16, none of them workedproperly.The first 5 to 15 minutes, when played back they ran at fast forward. Then, when they actually startedrecording semi properly, they were filled with snow, in some cases to where the picture was barely visible, andreally could not be watched and enjoyed. That will be the ONE and ONLY time, I ever purchase this brand. The quality isabsolutely terrible. Every other brand I have ever used, has worked much, MUCH better than these. These cannot be depended on to even perform the most basic function while recording.And yes, this is based on what Sony is calling PREMIUM grade. Apparently, no quality control existAT ALL, before these are put up for sale. If you had not problems with yours, you got the luck ofthe draw. NEVER AGAIN!"
3,Patient Care in Radiography,Just a text book I needed for class. Not really wanting to buy it but had to. Overall ordering and such was great no problems with shipping or anything.
4,A Little Dissapointed,"I wasn't able to find any information as to the size of the pendant when I ordered. When I got the necklace, I was dissapointed to find that it's the size of a military style dogtag. For a female of small stature, like myself, that's too big to wear everyday: it should be marked as a men's necklace. Also, when I recieved the pendant the front side was scratched (I assume from shipping, as the shipper sent it in an envelope over the retail display box!) and the reverse side has a manufacturer's mark. The chain it comes with is also very long. I will say that both the pendant and the chain were well-made and don't feel at all cheap. If the pendant had been smaller, I'd be much happier!"
2,Cheese spreader - Teapots,"Photo on website 1,000 better than the real thing. Although this product does look more attractive than the others I purchase, it's still cheap plastic rubbish. I seen better. Not worth the money. Am extremely disappointed with the product, the seller, the seller and the delivery time. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."
3,Must buy the RS232 cable!!!!!!,"I hope this is going to be a great product. I just unpacked it and discovered that although it's computerized, and the software is included, THE FREAKING CABLE TO CONNECT IT IS NOT! To quote the Installation Instructions, ""establishing a link ... will require the use of an optional RS-232 cable (#9320)."" How a product that lists for $995 claim a ""required"" part is ""optional"" is beyond me. Amazon should be ashamed of the listing for this item."
2,Get Your Friends to Cater Your Wedding,"The title was misleading. I was truly looking for tips on how to successfully cater my daughter's wedding myself. This book's whole premise is to have 17 to 29 of your closest friends prepare an item and bring it. Just not my style. Although I really did like the outline of food on banquet tables, I found the book a little lacking regarding appropriate table centerpieces and other reception decorations."
4,Great Program,Just read this book and started the program. So far so good. It is a bodybuilding program with a fitness component.
2,Jargon Filled & Confusing,"I read the first three chapters of this book and could not follow it. Way too much Jargon, intials and acronyms.Written in a very pompous, my way is the only way type of style. Every concepts was abbreviated and initialized.My suggestion save your C.R.E.A.M., avoid EDT and BYOB until TGIF.Exactly!"
3,Dissappointed,"I have been purchasing stereo speakers for over 30 years now and was looking for outside speakers to place in my new yard shed. I purchased these speakers for two reasons. First and foremost, the JBL name. Secondly was the price. Actually, I feel let down by the name as these speakers do not sound that great and have actually thought about returning the speakers but decided b/c they are in a shed, in the yard, I can live with them. If these speakers were for in the house, they definitely would have been returned. They are not as clear as other speakers I have. The bass is a little dull and treble has a lot to be desired. Again, I will keep them but would not purchase them again nor recommend them."
3,Make sure you realize how big these are,"Sound quality is quite reasonable and they seem to hold up okay to moderate weather exposure. It's hard to appreciate how large they are until you see them, though. They are not what I would consider a ""wall-mountable"" size. They aren't heavy, they just look enormous when they're up on a wall."
3,An imaginative and cool fantasy!,"DESPISER is a wild little film. Made for almost nothing, I found it refreshing and innovative for its budget. I could easily have seen this as a main stream Hollywood flick with some star power and money behind it -- an imaginative and cool fantasy. It's certainly better than most of the shot on video features that liter the shelves of rental stores.There is undeniably a lot to enjoy in Despiser. It's an ambitious project ... Given its budget, it achieves much... I'd like to see what Phil Cook could do with some Hollywood resources or even some decent indie financial backing. If you like a fantasy adventure that's not cynical, has a lot of action and an fairly original storyline, check it out. If your in it just for T&A; and blood and an gore, it won't be your cup of tea."
1,Good God.,"Oh man. The worst movie EVER. Because it was so cheap, most scenes are done as computer anamations. I have games that have better graphics than this movie.I would rather punch myself in the face than see this again."
4,Good Value,"I was pleased with the sound from these speakers. I only give 4 stars because the screen is flimsy and the plactic prongs break easy. JBL is not very customer friendly, but the price is right. I bought 2 of these for $510. Suggest you look around online."
2,Now that it's 1999 . . .,"I would respectfully ask Ms. Cannon to get back on the horn with Nostradamus and explain why the predicted apocalypse of 1998 (flooding caused by nuclear testing, apparently) did not occur, without using the ""alternative futures"" escape. Still, I respect Cannon, who doesn't spread the virulent anti-Catholicism of many other Nostradamus interpreters."
4,A light-hearted introduction to advanced propulsion systems.,"Your journey towards anti-gravity research should begin here. This book is lavishly illustrated with diagrams and photographs, describing the inner most workings of theoretical anti-gravity engines, and the role of the ""world grid"" in UFO propulsion. If you believe that certain technologies have and are being suppressed or covered up by the governments of this planet, this book is for you."
1,Never Should Have Happened,"Skinny Puppy should have stopped after ""Last Rights"". ""The Process"" made me cringe, but this album makes me sick. There's nothing here that even resembles what Puppy used to be and that was a very cool, very original band. We've all heard this stuff before. It's on the radio and in commercials on TV. It's not socially redeeming or even entertaining in the slightest. It's a very, very bad album and a slap in the face to true Skinny Puppy fans.I want my money back and if you decide to buy this CD, you'll want your's back too."
2,completely lame,I CANT BELIEVE THAT KEY'S & O GRE ARE GOING TO GO OUT LIKE THIS . THATS SUCH A SHAME . THEY HAVE CAME COME SO FAR IN MUSIC& DONE SO & THEY HAVE SUCH A FOLLOWING JUST LET THEM SELVES & THERE FANS DOWN . I THANK GOD I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM BEFORE I BOUGHT IT . I WILL NOT BUY IT . I THINK IT IS A BIG LET DOWN TO EVERY 1LOL WHAT A WAY TO GO OUT & TO BE REMEMBERED BY
4,A Neuwerld of Music!,"This was my first Skinny Puppy CD and while i'm impressed, I don't plan on buying any past albums. As good as this CD is... It just doesn't have the qualities of a lasting album. I can't picture myself listening to this CD come 2 years from now. No replay value if you ask me. More-less flavor of the week industrial. But aside from all that, there still is alot of talent on here and if your into industrial this is definitley one to check out. I'd say it's within the top 10 EBM albums this year."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This album is very listenable, but not revolutionary. Skinny Puppy built their reputation on being revolutionary, though not very listenable. Ever since ""Download,"" I've considered their work alright, but nothing extraordinary. It's definitely better than the music filling most mainstream airwaves, but Puppy's nowhere near the progressive force they were in the 1980s, when they defined an entire movement. In 100 years, musicologists (the smart ones anyway) will study Too Dark Park, Vivisect, etc. -- not the Greater Wrong of the Right."
3,This book explores various jobs through rhyme.,This is a good book to introduce beginning readers to rhyme. It has many uses in the elementary classroom.
4,Memories.,I enjoyed this when it was out on TV. Looked for years. Finally found it. It is as good as I remember.
4,Stingray (the Complete Series),"I saw the TV series and loved it, I am very happy to find it available for purchase. I am a satisfied customer"
4,MANCUSO HAS A COOL APPROACH.,"TO BAD THE SERIES ONLY LASTED ONE SEASON. MANCUSO IS EXCELLENT IN THE TITLE CHARACTER AND HE IS A DO GOODER THAT SEEKS TO RIGHT THE WRONGS, LIKE CANNELL'S OTHER SERIES ""COBRA. I'D RATHER WATCH THAT NOW THAN THE CRAP THEY PUT ON NOWADAYS. HAIL RHODESIA, DEATH TO MUGABE AND THAT FECE EATING MUHAMMEDAN SHIBAZZ."
3,Nice Product...kinda...,"I ordered this to help me take my work with me wherever I go. I am very active and needed something I could carry with me without being a bulky hassle. But one thing Sony forgot to design was a clip of some sort so that it doesnt fall out of your pocket so smoothly that it's lost within the first day of posession. Granted, they do have a ""keychain"" hole on both ends of the device with which to attach it to somehting which is less likely to be misplaced. But it didnt even fit nicely on a thin half inch ring, much less the main ring of my keys, and they dont supply even a small nylon cord built for it's poorly designed holes. It's too expensive a gadget to have a poor tether assembly, and it's too easily adoptable by a passerby. The usefulness of the product however is very high. It just needs a better design."
1,it's worthless,horrible. did nothing for me. Can't be returned. I am displeased. I don't know what else to say to fill up the required amount of writing.
2,Think twice,Very disappointing. Save your money. Anyway it's shock protected while in the original package. I checked that by dropping it from the 4-th floor height.
5,Works Great!!!!,My Wife loves this little thing. It gets her off within 5 minutes usually sooner.Its very easy to hold and lightweight so your hands wont get tired holding it. Its very quiet I think. If you want to have alot of hard easy orgasms 1 after the other GET THIS!!!
1,Smoking... Literally the vibrator shorted out,"Product was very cheaply made and shorted out after 3 uses, Nothing worse than smoke from down under!"
2,I just didn't enjoy it.,"I felt this was dense and boring. I had to read it. I didn't enjoy it, at some points I felt that he was really going way too in depth with concepts that didn't require such complex explanation."
1,An invaluable resource,I am a grad student. I would love to own the large volume... This is a wonderful resource to have when [the price] is more than you can spend. I highly recommend this version.It serves me very well when I am writing research papers. Lynne Perrin
5,Sony Digital 8 Camcorder Tape,Product was fine and works as expected. Hard to find this commonly used product for digital camcorders on the shelves anymore...
1,Wrong product. No Credit,"I received the wrong tapes, returned them as instructed and, two months later am still awaiting a credit to my card. I guess I'll have to call Databazaar AGAIN."
5,A book for the serious stained glass artist.,"I am delighted that this, previously, out of print book is available once more. I have recently completed a degree course in Architectural Glass (stained glass, etc.) and this is THE definitive text book on glass painting. This is not really a book for hobbyists and for those using coloured paints that are not fired, but a book for serious stained glass artists. I had a copy of a previous printing, but lent it to someone and didn't get it back, so to find it available again was great. This book contains a lot more than my previos edition, with sections on preparation of paints, basic techniques, use of silver stain and later additions on enamels and etching."
5,Great holder for needles!,I love this little box! It is a great way to store my needles without worrying about them coming loose in my sewing basket.
3,Need a hard copy?,"If all you're looking for is to read The Law, do some googling first- there are plenty of free copies available online. If you know it's available for free but would like a hard copy to have on hand, this is an acceptable version. It's not terribly professional- the cover photo is pretty grainy, and there are a few very obvious editing oversights- but in general, this is a good copy. The content itself is very interesting- Bastiat provides quite a few interesting arguments against too much government action. Along the way, he also mentions a number of other political philosophers, which should give the reader leads to begin learning more."
5,An Argument for Justice,"More than just a treatise on socioeconomic justice, The Law is a handbook for orderly thinking. It clears away the weak arguments and rationalizing that clutter the stage of history and conceal tyrants, and exposes the foes of true liberty and brotherhood for who and what they are. To those conscientious individuals for whom a just society is an attainable ideal, this book is required reading - over and over again."
2,"Not enough depth, Doesn't even scratch the surface of VF3tb","This is a book that lists combos and moves. For that it is great. The major failing point is that this is all that it is. You can get the moves sheet from gamefaqs.com. I need a book with all the strategies and methods for each character. Virtua Fighter is a deep and complicated game that is full of anticipation and knowing which moves to use and when to use them. It does not show in what situations to use certain moves or tell you the exact timing of the combos ( really important ). In fact it fails miserably. Don't get this book, all it is is shiny paper with pictures of moves but no substance."
1,What the?,"This cabinet was undeliverable the first time I ordered it because the mirror was already broken. When I reordered, I think the same cabinet was sent because the ""broken"" mirror had been dumped out, leaving a few shards of it in the box!"
2,Disappointment,"It's always better to give an example upon which to work. The author provides a few, mainly the least important,photos upon which to apply her suggestions. The rest is a concoction of her lists of what she did when she assessed a particular photo. That is a very substandard way of teaching. It's virtually impossible to follow her thinking in a meaningful way. It is like a little of this, a little of that. Poor reasoning and poorer presentation. Accordingly, it's almost impossible to learn much from this book. Look elsewhere if you want to master the subject. This is pretty much a flop."
1,AMERICAN DREAM THE AMERICAN WAY,"The Great Gatsby is an extremely uninteresting, boring book. It has no suspense, the characters are dull, and the whole book in general lacks quality. The verbal and lexical extemporaneuity of certain paragraphs in the book makes it an even more confusing book to follow. If you're looking for a book to read, the Great Gatsby is not it. If you consider yourself an intellectual, I suggest reading Pedro Paramo (I forget the author) or Karl Marx's Das Kapital for some stimulation. Better yet, write your own damn book and amuse yourself with whatever it is you come up with."
5,The Great Gatsby: A novel to learn from,"The Great Gatsby is one of the best American novels ever written. It's not because it has a suspenseful plot or anything that shallow books are made of, but because it teaches anyone who reads it to reevaluate his or her dreams. Fitzgerald's use of characters and symbolism, not just in this novel, but in all of his writing, is incredible. The reader is able to feel just how cool the rain feels when Nick is waiting for Gatsby and Daisy to talk and just how unbearably hot it feels in the hotel. Fitzgerald is... amazing."
1,Worse than I Could Imagine,Truly this deserves a minus 5 stars. Usually I enjoy BBC movies. NOT THiS TIME BUSTER! Having already read the book I was ready to sit back and enjoy the movie version. Didn't happen. This was so poorly acted and directed that I could not make myself watch the whole thing (even on fast forward). I can only assume whomever assigned the roles of the two Boleyn girls was on drugs at the time. I didn't even try to give this one away. I broke it in two and tossed it in the trash where it belongs.
5,Classic Scent,"I had read about Acqua Di Parma online, and I started investigating it a bit.There aren't too many places around that carry it, so when I found it online,I wasexcited to order it and try it out.From the descriptions of it, I wasn't too sure what to expect, 'notes of citrus' etc.What I found when I actually tried the cologne was something very unexpected. It's a veryclean scent, almost soap-like and I couldn't stop myself from smelling it and trying to figure out thedifferent scent layers.What I discovered was that the longer I spent with the cologne, the more I liked itand frankly, now I use it as the gold standard when trying other scents. For years I've lookedfor a signature scent, something that would just be me and I think I've found it.Light, fresh and clean."
4,Ok,"Sinceramente lo compre para regalar. no puedo dar información sobre el producto.De igual manera, el producto tiene buena presentacion."
4,Well worth your time and dollar.,"Well worth your time and dollar. This movie has striking footage! Sound could be better, but at this price, who can ask for more. Guaranteed to be a step above the rest."
3,Never reveal the truth about your own kind...,"happens to be the first law of the vampires. One of many laws the Strigoi follow. It just happens to be the most important. Selim, the Enforcer for Los Angeles, finds out that somebody is breaking that law. In fact, this somebody is about to throw the vampires' truth onto the big screen.On top of that, he has to approve a Hunt, because many of the vampires in the city want to taste blood. The nests want blood REALLY bad and the leaders might not wait for him to give the OK.To add to his problems, he is having issues with his female companion (in other words, his lover).What's a Hunter to do?Found the first book kind of bland. Might buy the next one to see if it gets interesting. Might not."
1,huh?,Why am I getting asked to review this? i didn't order this. This is something my mom ordered...not me. Please ask her to review this.
1,"No Live, Just Jive","This video has very live footage. Don't buy it if you're looking to see what a live Linkin Park show is like. If you want to find out more about the history of the band, what the members are like, what it's like to go on tour and be in a tour bus, then it's right for you. But if you want to see them play, don't waste your money."
3,I'M NOT SURE???????,"I AM/WAS (CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW),A LINKIN PARK FAN. THEIR MUSIC IS GOOD.I GOT THIS DVD LAST WEEK AND WATCHED IT WITH MY KID AND AFTER WATHCING IT I'M NOT SURE IF THESE GUY'S AREN'T THE BACKSTREET BOYS IN LINKIN PARK'S CLOTHING.WHATEVER, I GUESS THEIR GOAL IS TO SELL RECORDS AND THEIR DOING THAT. GOD BLESS, BUT DO THEY REALLY PERFORM AT LIVE SHOWS? OR DO THEY PLAY TRACKS AND DO A KARAOKE SING AND PLAY? OPERATION ""SELL RECORDS"" COMPLETE. N-SYNC,AND HANSON SOLD ALOT OF RECORDS ALSO. THE END"
4,Not Bad,Now I liked the first one better but this one still was well acted and very interesting. Although I think it would have done good on tv I think it was very good and kept your attention with great dialouge and wity talent. I reccomend this movie.
1,Worst,This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love the first one but this one is just lame.
1,First movie is ALWAYS the best one than the second movie,This movie is pretty odd and little mix-up parts but it's ALMOST the same as the first movie. I always like the first movie better than this one. I ordered this movie because of Keri Lynn Pratt and that I really loved the first one and I was hoping this movie would be great one but it's not. I still have this movie but I hardly watch this movie because my boyfriend really love this movie so I dont bother sell it. Our things is ours so. I am warning you guys dont order this movie unless you REALLY want to see it then go rent a movie BEFORE you order it!! Save your money!!
3,a prequel?,this is a prquel to a very good movie. It is obvious at the end of the first one there is now way there could be a real sequel. Through and through this movie holds in there and while never comming close to the original is entertaining and a must for fans of the first
2,Not exactly your normal teen flick!,"As prequels go, this one really sets up how Sebastian came to the Big Apple to live with hsi dad, stepmom, and seductive stepsister, Katherine. ""Seduce and destroy"" is Katherine's motto,a dn nothing gets in her way except Sebastian. Of course as we know if you've viewed the original, Sebastian and Katherine are both playmates, which is kinda of out of the ordinary. This prequel ends with Sebastian turning into a seduce and destroyer. Rent the original, avoid prequels that are direct-to-video."
2,The movie is...,"Let me say this, Cruel Intenions 2 is really different from the first. The movie is about Kathryn (Amy Adams) and her step-brother Sebastian (Robin Dunne). They are two siblings who will go to far lengths to get what they want. Sabastian wants to get to know Danielle (Sarah Tompson),the daughter of Manchester Prep's Headmaster. Meanwhile, Kathryn is the new leader of the Manchester Tribunal. A group of popular kids that plan to get rid of the ""losers"" in the school. Wonder why you barely heard of this movie? It was a tv show that got cancelled. Then they made it into a prequal movie. A prequal that didn't even hit theaters. Unlike Cruel Intenions, Cruel Intenions 2 doesn't star Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, or Reese Witherspoon. It also lacks a good script. The acting falls short and the style is more of a comedy."
3,Great Work -- Faulty Binding,"Harnack's work is a classic in modern theology and deserves five stars for its influence alone. The binding of this edition, however, (at least the one I ordered for our university library) cracks almost anywhere you open it."
3,Does not include mini adapter...anymore?,"I ordered one of these a couple months ago, and the first one came with the adapter. It's a good thickness and does the job well. However, upon ordering a second one, there wasn't an adapter in sight. That's poor QA on their part. Buy at your own risk."
4,Perfect!,"This cage is gonna be perfect for my new-coming cockatiel, it has a perfect size too,the only downside is that due to mass production some of the drill holes may not be punched all the way but their easy to pop out with your finger. Also some of the parts may be bent but are easy to fix. Assembly instructions were a little bland, but I still figured it out. Last thing, keep in mind the height of this cage is about 5ft just in case some people are on the shorter side."
1,"Dangerous, poorly made, unsafe","We had this cage about 30 days. In the first 20 days of ownership, one of our cockatiels got his foot caught in the opening between the food access door and the cage twice. Both instances, his foot was hurt. When we were disassembling the cage for return to Amazon, we also noticed that some of the welds had already come off.Maybe this cage would work for a larger parrot but it definitely does not work for cockatiels due to the safety issue I mentioned.And if I had a larger parrot, I would not want a cage with faulty welds that failed within 30 days of ownership.Either way, this is a poorly made product and I would recommend against buying it."
4,This episode is not for those with claustrophobia,"SPOILER ALERTMy wife and I both love this series, but she had a hard time watching this episode as Hardison spends a good part of the episode in a coffin in a grave and he can't get out. Other than that, another great show!"
5,Getting Better With Age,"Leverage keeps getting better. Lots of humor, fun, great characters and terrific guest stars. Too many TV shows begin to fall apart after the 3rd season, but not Leverage."
4,Good product but watch out for the rebate!,"This is a great product which is very sturdy and durable since it doesn't have the metal rings on the spine which you can open to add more insert to the wallet. You don't need to add more insert since it is going to be big and heavy enough with 320 discs. Also, it doesn't have any pocket inside or on the cover of the wallet which is not a big deal for me.The only thing I don't like is the rebate has to be mailed within 15 days after your purchase. Luckly I got mine on the fourteenth day with the free shipping. Unless you're paying more for faster shipping, you're taking your own risk. However, even you don't get your rebate, the price is still competitive."
5,Most Excellent !,"Hard to put down. Excellent twists and turns of events, plot and outcomes. Descriptive enough to feel as if you lived in this ancient time and feared and struggled in Ireland's historical past. One of those books that you are sad to see come to an end."
2,avoid this book unless you like cold & bratty heroines,"Most of the other reviews are quite enthusiastic, but I just can't seem to find the appeal of this book. The real problem is with the heroine -- Miranda is absolutely unbearable. She is one of the most unlikable heroines I've read in a long time. She is completely obnoxious in her behavior towards Chas (cold, condensending, and just downright cruel at times) and spends the majority of the book throwing one long pity-party for herself. Chas, on the other hand, borders on too-good-to-be-true, but at least he behaves like an adult thoughout (most of) the book. The characters make the whole story completely unbelievable: ""perfect man relentlessly pursues mean, self-centered woman"". No man in his right mind would take the abuse Miranda dumps on Chas and then keeping coming back for more. My advice is to skip this one, although I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I have read worse romances..."
4,Spring Fling,"This book was fulfilling - it had a great romance, strong male and female characters, and a storyline that was easy to follow, and fun. I read Big Trouble by Marianne Jameson last year and was impressed enough to read this book, and I was not disappointed. Both books provide a wonderful escape from reality, and it just so happens that the character in My Hero is a romance writer. Randi Rhodes/Miranda Lane is having some trouble writing her latest romance when who should come upon the scene ... sexy cop Chas Casey. Their meeting, and subsequent romance is fun and engaging and you really grow to like the characters. It's not great fiction, no, but this book is a nice spring fling."
1,Lame,"Good effort, but get an editor, and write a good sentence!A few good ideas, a resource or two, but not worth the money and the two month shipping time."
5,Most Excellent!,I received this book as a Christmas present from my girlfriend. The reproductions are excellent. My only complaints are the tiny reproductions of related paintings and drawings and the long paragraphs of French quotes. Other than that this book is required reading for all Sargent fans. Hopefully some day someone will publish more books on Sargent's pencil and pen & ink drawings.C. Ousley
1,The reproductions are ver bad,"I've just got this book and I'm very disappointed. The reproductions are awful!The works don't look like originals in the museums, colors are muddy, their clarity and brilliance gone."
4,Very comprehensive,"Working with Buddhist Monks from Sri Lanka where the native language is Sinhalese, I found this dictionary very useful in looking up certain words and phrases. All though a few words were not exactly right, and by a few I only mean about two or three... but with that in consideration this book is one of the closest you will find around. I have yet to see any better."
4,I liked it,"It's true that nothing really ""happens."" What I love about these turn-of-the-century San Francisco novels by Norris is the dead-on detailed glimpse of mores and society and the rigors of daily life at the time. If you don't revel in domestic minutiae of a bygone time, then no, I don't think the moral lessons (always gentle) are enough to stick it out. But I love it."
2,Kept waiting for something to happen. It never did.,I read the entire book waiting for something to happen. It never did. The only interesting thing that ever happened to this woman was only eluded to and then only WELL after the fact. There are many worthwhile classics to read. This is NOT one of them.
5,Impressions Infinitum,"The late actor-activist,Ossie Davis once opined- ""Art is the highest form of creative genius available to man"". The CD-The Impressions/The Never Ending Impressions is a good representative of this dictum.Originally formed in 1958,theImpressions on this disc consist of-Fred Cash,Sam Gooden and led by their incomparable, dynamic, inimitable, singer-songwriter guitarist,Curtis Mayfield; This CD with songs like ""It's All Right"",""I'm So Proud"",""Little Boy Blue"",""Gypsy Woman"",and ""I Gotta Keep On Moving"",paints a picture of maintaining our humanity and rejuvenating our spirit!"
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"Newton writes well. I found his book worthy of reading, but if you are expecting a deep study in the psychology of essential human nature absent the influence of culture you will be disappointed. The book focuses primarily on the impressions of those who have encountered feral human beings within a civilized setting. It is full of folk-psychological analyses of the phenomenon but nearly devoid of any in-depth scientific analysis. Perhaps what I was expecting is not available due to the ethical restrictions on studies of human beings. Nevertheless, the book seems more an exercise of philology than psychology or philosophy."
3,Get a free copy instead,"Please be advised; the Trial of John Jasper, advertised on the title page, is nowhere found in this edition except for a few paragraphs in the introduction. It would have been worth the money if some transcript or report of it had been appended, although the pictures are a plus. Otherwise, go for a no-cost edition and order WR Nicoll's The Problem of Edwin Drood, also at no cost on kindle."
3,"An Informative, if Somewhat Basic, Text","I purchased this book for a class entitled ""The Aging Brain."" With the astounding pace of research in neurology, neurobiology, neuropsychology, and related fields, I found The Neuropspychology of Aging to be somewhat dated (it was published in 1997).It provides a comprehensive overview of age-related changes in sensory systems, neuroanatomy, peripheral nervous system functions, and neuropathological conditions. However, much of the information was basic information that did not enhance my knowledge base (to be fair, my area of research is age-related brain changes). I would recommend this book for beginner or intermediate knowledge-seekers about the neuropsychological changes associated with aging. For graduate-level students or professionals, look elsewhere."
2,Merely a short term *cloaking* strategy,"Although this particular book offers some useful information, it uses the same strategy as every other book writen about this subject. Save your money, pay your creditors. If you can borrow the book from a friend, then do so."
1,Junk,"Bierman has written several books on the subject of credit repair. Why? Why not write ONE book, and update it with new editions? Because he's basically nothing more than a credit repair agency operating as an author. None of his books is overly helpful, none of his books gives you any more info than a decent use of Google won't uncover. I want to know what REALLY effects my score. I want to know how removing a false collections report will effect my score. Will I find that kind of info in a Bierman book? Never."
2,Nothing but covering for not paying bills,"I'm a loan officer, and after reading this book, I definitely want full documentation from my customers before I have any loan approved. Why? One review called it 'cloaking', that's about right. You aren't going to repair any credit telling a creditor to stop mailing. And covering your problems up will only surmount to new problems. Just pay your bills on-time, and you will repair the problems. People honestly believe there is a quick-fix to credit, and I will tell you now - THE ONLY HEALER IS TIME AND A HISTORY OF ON-TIME PAYMENT! Deadbeats may want to read this book to learn more about how to create problems. God Bless and good luck with your Chapter 13s! Email if you wish."
5,Dwayne Johnson x 3,This three pack of Dwayne Johnson is great. It is fantastic to see him in his earlier work. Many thanks.
5,Quality!,"Lets see....the band is good, the music is better, and the lead guitarist gives me guitar lessons. Sounds good to me--um 5 stars."
5,Something we can all relate to,"The boys from darby jones seem to be very down-to-earth and receptive to what's going on in their own worlds, as well as the world around them. They know about love and life, and everyday situations, just listen to Shannon and you know it!"
2,Not,"Naming an album something like Good is just asking for trouble...unless you plan on delivering. This is the only Morphine album that isn't...well...good.""You Speak My Language"" and ""I Know You Pt. 1 & 2 are the only songs that keep this from being completely disposable.Go directly to Yes or Cure For Pain, do not collect ""Good""."
1,Not As Advertised,"Like so many who write books on art, this author doesn't cover the subject as promised. Gouache IS NOT THE SAME as watercolors in pans, tubes or bottles. If you are going to advertise on the front of your book that you cover the subject of gouache, you should do so in depth, not just lump it in with the rest of the water based paints. I could not find any reference to this medium other than on the cover.This is also not a complete course on drawing and painting!I returned the book."
1,The pockets are not very big,The pouch does not fit the 77mm filters properly. I have seen better pouches than this. I feel the overall dimensions should be bigger.
1,Disappointing,"I was expecting Xmas music from the past and got a load of spoken word (radio,) with terrible English accents. Really stinks!"
2,No Good,This watch stopped working after a month. The face just went blank so I am in the process of trying to find a battery to see if that is the problem. The battery was supposed to be good for at least 2 years. Ya right!
3,Good disposable watch,"I live in central California (farming area) and this watch was able to sync up and keep accurate time easily. Screen is easy to read in light. It has no back lighting so if you are in the dark, you will not be able to see the screen. Battery life is good. This version allows for a normal watch band to replace the original one, unlike it's brother.After some use, all the silver wears off and your watch is a plastic brownish grey. The clear face scratches quite easily.This is a good disposable watch. I wish they would make one with a bit more quality and durability."
1,Stereo please!,"YES! Japan comes through for the fans of Basie's stereo years on Verve...except for this one. Recorded in 1965(!), this CD comes to us in mono only! Someone didn't check their tape before doing the transfer, or just didn't give a rat's patootie. Yes, the performance is spot on, but the recording lacks the depth that my stereo LP has. Too bad...had it been the stereo edition, this CD would have rated five stars."
5,Silver Charm a Gem of Golden Delight,"I ordered this charm on 01-24-07, in the evening. I received it, via USPS, 01-17-07. It was shipped in a protective, padded envelope. Within was a plastic bag with a silver cardboard box, the charm and chain, both of sterling silver. The Golden Retriever charm and the lovely chain are gorgeous. This is the first Golden Retriever charm I have seen that is beautifully made and reasonably priced.Sabrina's Silver has many more delightful dog charms. Well worth a look!"
1,What a bore,"Of the countless dozen WW2 air combat memoirs I have read, this must be one of the dullest ever. The author manages to take the reader through the entire war without once managing to make the action exciting enough for us to care what happens to him. ""I got up, got into the plane, got to fighting altitude, got a German in my sights and got a few shots off at him,"" is about as thrilling as it gets. This book is just awful -- so much potential and such a pathetic end result."
5,Excellent - I was there!,"I was an associate of Mickey's. I am 80 yrs old and knew Steve when he was running with ""our crew"". Steve pretty much nailed what his relationship was with Mickey. His book took me back to those times. Steve was respectful of my privacy and kept me out of his book. Thanks Steve, you were always a stand up guy. As far as the review where the mook said Steve was being self indulgent, I have something to say. You are all wet pal. Steve's book captures the mood of that time and how Mickey operated. Few in the public know who I am. The LAPD and FBI sure do. And so does Steve. I highly recommend this book. I was there and so was Steve. Anton Giordano Hosney."
2,*Ashley Ballard* 2. 5 stars for effort and a few good beats,1. Hottie- It has a nice beat~ Other than that.. Ughh2. Snippets Hypnotized- I liked this one ! 5 x 5- This single of Ashley Ballard is filled w/ a few good beats~ And this is one of the best~ All I Ever- It's ok.. Nothing greatShe won't become big or anything.
4,Da Chen continues his interesting story,"An excellent reflection of the moods and challenges of late adolescence and early adulthood, combined with the special cultural mosaic of recent Chinese times. I enjoyed this autobiographical book quite a lot, although I did find it less engaging than his first work. Still, I enjoyed his first work, Colors of the Mountain, so much that I wanted to follow Da Chen into his college days. The bureaucracy, tips and tricks of the society, students, and school are described well, handled in ways that make them engaging and interesting. I agree it seems on occasion melodramatic, but feel this characteristic simply reflects well the tensions experienced by these young people as they proceed into work and/or college days: full of serendipity - or lack of luck, hormones, happiness, failure, love, disappointment, success, discipline or sloth, greed or generosity, bureaucracy and favoritism."
1,An Ultimate Disappointment,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. When something is advertised as a ""mix"" compilation, I expect the mixes to be longer than four minutes. If you're looking for length, forget this CD. The only track I actually liked was the one done by Aretha Franklin. The others seem like really cheesy and feeble disco attempts. Nothing else sticks out; nothing else rises to any level of expectations. Whoever mixed this CD managed to take some great artists and make them sound VERY mediocre.Divas NEVER have track listings of barely over three minutes. It's an insult to them and an insult to the buyer. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
4,prada mv633 cream colored mini handbag,"This handbag is kinda small, but enough to fit my cell phone, wallet, and keys. Although it is very simple, the price is worth it for an authentic Prada bag. Unless you don't care about wearing designer or not, I would not recommend this bag to you. However, if you do want it for its name (like me), this is a great and cheap bag by Prada."
2,Not-So-EZAudio,"While the software appears to be pretty good, the cable is completely wrong. The available jacks on it are not compatible with my new computer or my old one. In fact, I can't remember ever having RCA jacks on any of my computers. Since I bought this mostly becuase it promised to have the correct cable, obviously I was very dissapointed. I will have to find the correct cable on my own elsewhere."
5,Great Book!,After having read all the books leading up to this one I can only say that Ralph Moody's parents had reason to be proud of their son. What an illustration of how faithful and honest parenting will build the character of a man.
4,A godsend for research papers,"This little book has gotten my forensic team through countless tournaments, and is the basis for the senior high research papers on contemporary issues. Each of the fifty topics is clearly organized into ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Background"", and ""Outlook"" (slightly outdated now that it's 2002). Each side of the argument is divided into 3-6 main points which are in bold print. These are briefly developed with specific facts, examples, etc. The only drawback is that although Starer includes a list of his references, he does not specifically match a fact to a reference. But it is an easy way to see that there are two sides (at least) to every issue. I would love to see a second edition!"
1,I'm Sorry but not worth the money!,"I read this book in two days and to be honest I'm really surprised as to how many people gave this book 5 stars. Forgive me but you must have very low standards to give this one such high ratings. Almost half the book talks about insurances,mortgages, how to drive really old cars and not spend money on new ones (so as to save), how to not go to restaurants too often and not buy things that you won't really use. That's about it. And I bought this book thinking that I would get some expert advise that I didn't know myself already. Sorry!"
5,"Awesome book, written in plain English, it just makes sense","This book was an absolute pleasure to read, a rare thing for financial books. It covers those things I need to know about, and it does it with humor. And, of course, I'm a big fan of the decision tree! Highly recommend this one. Enjoy!"
3,Disappointing,I was disappointed that this book dealt very little with late retirement planning. It mostly concentrates on getting out of debt.
3,Buyer Beware! Copy Protected CD's!,"The music on these two BJH albums is wonderful! The problem is that this particular set is copy protected! I made the mistake of buying this set to save money only to find that it wouldn't play in my car or in my portable MP3 CD player. Needless to say, I'm going to spend the extra money on the separate CD's that aren't copy protected. 5 stars for the music, 3 stars for the Copy Protection."
5,Excellent Head Cleaner,"I have a Sony Handycam that pretty much quit working. I tried several other head cleaners that did nothing. Finally, I found the sony head cleaner (which I could not find at any of the major electronic chains) and 30 seconds later my camera was shooting pictures again. I would highly recommend this head cleaner to anyone who regularly uses their camera. Use it every couple of tapes and you'll never have a problem. The price is a value being that lower quality head cleaners are selling for $50.00 at the major chains and they don't work as well as this head cleaning cassette."
3,...,It would be nice if there was more cleaning tape in this cassette. I have used it once. Does it help...?
1,They don't actually spin.,"My husband and I were suckered into buying two of these type of ""wind spinners"" at a kiosk in a shopping mall. Now that they're hanging outside, what kind of wind are they looking for, a frickin' hurricane? They just sit there and look stupid (while reminding us of the money ill spent)."
5,My favorite toy,"Love, love, love this toy. Since six months, my daughter has be able to engage, gnaw, hit, sort, and now, stack this toy. It's simply a classic, and as someone else said, it is gorgeous. The rich colors reminisce Dr. Seuss in a wonderful way."
5,Great instructional manual!!,"Wow, I have to wonder if I read the same book as the other reviewers. This book includes an illustrated section on hand placements for self treatment and treatment of others. The history section offers some insight into the reliability of known information on Reiki and the Grand Masters. The book also explains why you need to be attuned and why the symbols are kept sacred (or should be). This book has a lot of wonderful information and I would suggest all Reiki practicioners read it."
3,"""Cruel Game"" a/k/a ""She Said I Love You"" and ""Deception""","Filmmaker Masashi Nagadoi wrote and directed this noir thriller starring the wonderful Jennifer Rubin. Co-starring Victoria Silvstedt (Playboy's 1997 Playmate of the Year) and Mako (of various M*A*S*H episodes).The film concerns a man, his four girlfriends, a million dollars of Yakuza money, and several double-crosses.Beware: ""Cruel Game"" is also known as ""She Said I Love You"" and ""Deception""."
4,Good Book,"I am in the midst of reading this book and I have to say I love it. Although it explores the darker side of Elvis, it also speaks of his kind and sensitive sides. It could use more info on his music, but if you are a true fan and want to learn about the man behind the music, this is the book. CAUTION: This book will disapoint some fans who thought Elvis was a perfect person - he wasn't. All in all, it is thorough on his life and has a good bibliography."
2,I could have gone the rest of my life not knowing that......,"This book is good if you appreciate hear say and gossip. While I know that Elvis couldn't walk on water, there are some things in this book that didn't need to be written. You can never tell if this is a book for or against the King of Rock and Roll. I'm for him, that's why I threw the book away. I'm giving it 2 stars becuse they had some good pictures and everything was spelled correctly."
4,Deluxe ATM,"This is a good educational product in the aspect that it teaches children how to save money and also helps with counting and identifing coins and bills. The only down fall to this product is, even though that it does accept bills, it will only accept a few bills before you have to shake the contents to the left to make room for more. But it does say this on the box. I recommend putting only coins in the ATM. Overall i rate 4 stars."
4,KEIR DULLEA IS BACK!!!,"The guy who couldn't act in 2001 has a bit role in this film. This is a more practical man meets alien sci-fi movie, which means it is duller or Dullea as the case might be. What I like about the story is that someone finally gets it right about infections with alien organisms making contact between life on two planets deadly for both worlds. The basic plot is: Man finds alien. Alien organisms kill man. Man kills alien and then nukes him for good measure. What made the movie unbelievable is that James Spader, who has a reputation as a ""hound"" keeps turning down major league babes. What was with that?"
5,Daughter loves it,Fun for my 8 year old kid to play with when she is playing with my son and his huge collection. Nice rolling wheels and pretty paint design.
1,Item is often defective,"I would have given this keyboard a higher review if it was not defective. My work bought this one at OfficeMax. The mouse pads' lowest point was at least 3/4"" above the keyboard tray. I should have realized something was wrong, but after a couple of days it really started to hurt my mouse arm. Be careful! If you got a defective tray, return it. I called them and they said it could not be fixed and to return it. It appears the hardware to attach the mouse pads is wrong. The online description on the Kensington site says the mouse pads can adjust above and BELOW the keyboard tray. If yours doesn't, send it back before you hurt yourself.Otherwise, the adjustability of the tray itself was not that bad. I've had better and I've had much worse. There is not much knee clearance below the tray and I kept hitting my knees."
5,A great book for brides!,"This book is perfect for all types of brides. The workouts focus on the major problem areas that brides are concerned about: arms, butt and abs, among others. If you follow the program, you will definitely get the results you want to look good in your wedding gown."
5,Krush illustrations delightful!,"I read this book as a young girl and it was the illustrations by Joe and Beth Krush that haunted me for years! I scanned the library shelves every time I went, trying to find this book. When I found it I thought noting the name and author would be sufficient. Not so! I lost the notebook I wrote it in. I contacted many children's literature chat rooms (yes, that long ago!) and bought many ""likely"" books on eBay before the blessed day I saw it in a collection of children's books! All because the illustrations remained in my heart. Joe and Beth Krush also illustrated the ""Borrowers"" series and I loved them, too. I have since become a devotee of Elizabeth Enright's body of work and, unfortunately for us, she died quite young and did not have many books but I treasure them all."
1,This Book Stunk!,"I thought that this book was way too happy. The title sounds mysterious, but the book is filled with no mystery and no problem. The summary of the book makes you think that it's just amazing, but it's horrible. It doesn't deserve a Newberry Honor."
4,It's not what you think...,"<mild spoiler warning>Reading the other reviews for this book, the main criticism seems to be its story arc. The book has a complete arc, but it's not the one most fantasy readers expect.A lot of readers I think, are being miscued by the standard fantasy tropes (a lost King, a faceless evil being) to expect a quest tale, but this isn't Lord of the Rings. It's ""The Door in the Wall"". Garner gives the reader a few tantalizing glimpses into Elidor. He introduces those elements into our world and grounds them with details that are so specific and realistic, you almost believe it. Then once you've seen it, enough to believe in it and want more of it, he shuts the door and throws away the key.The reader is not meant to feel closure. You are meant to close the book and feel uneasy and want more. That's the magic of it."
1,this Miniature edition is cheating,"I do not think customers would like pay $12 for shipment to buy this matchbox size ""book"" of 95 pages, double side print.If not cheating why the book's image on Amazon is same as the other ordinary zise books'. The iamge of this book on Amazon should be much smaller to indicate this is a miniature edition."
1,Peter Lynch out to be ashamed!,"This is not a book. It is a tiny hard-cover pamphlet that Peter Lynch ought to be ashamed having having his name associated with.DO NOT BUY...even at $0.01 it is still a waste (because of the shipping cost - you are charged $3 and change to ship it, it costs the seller 73 cents and an envelope to send it first class).Back away, just back away."
1,Warning - this is a MINIATURE book,This is *not* the full version. Check out the size and the number of pages and compare to other versions. Don't buy this book if you want the complete version.
4,An intellectual spinster is on a collision course with love!,"Harriet's sister asks for the impossible. Sponsor her chocoholic niece next London Season. Unfortunately Harriet receives the attentions of a wicked man of the world, whilst her niece, Susan, buries her attentions in box, after box of chocolates. It's almost her downfall. Delightful story from the outstanding Regency Series Writer, Marion Chesney."
5,Love IT!,"I took the arm off this bracket and installed on a Titan Stand that use in my studio. Between the Titan stand, Vanguard GH-100 Pistol Grip Ball Head and this bracket I have the perfect set up. My Camera slides up and down the Titan Stand from 8' to the ground. The pistol grip is fast and efficient for pointing my camera in any direction. And the bracket makes it a breeze from me to instantly go from Portrait to Landscape. I love my set up. It has defiantly improved the quality of my images. With a wireless remote I can set up the camera, fine tune the client, and take a picture once I have moved out of the way. To sum it up - I Love It!"
2,Mystery solved. Next!,"A sullen girl is imprisoned in France. A young nun in Brazil is tormented by mysterious abdominal pain. Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? What is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words ""screel deen"" that the nun screams in her agonies?The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits."
4,Very good film!,This film is a great example of the excellent French/European filming. Gerard De Paurdiou is one of the most incredible performers I've seen. This film is a little confusing because of the lack of time to explain everything's going on but we can figure it out step by step in our minds. The actress playing the role of the twin sisters is superb. Is a suspense thriller that will surprise you as you would never imagine. Highly reccomended.
3,It's great for the price,"The tong didn't fit, it OK I guess, not very comfortable. But for the price, why not?"
5,Fuel Cap Locks,"This is what I wanted, Good Quality, I Was Looking every where for this lock, finally i got it from amazon."
4,Great Game,"NFL2K does a great job with the 2K4 version of this game, although special teams kick returns are a bit too easy. Overall, very fun and enjoyable experienceHere's a quick summary of the seriesNFL2K: Nice game but too many bugsNFL2K1: Incredible but key money play are out playsNFL2K2: Outs don't work any more, but sweeps and flairs the normNFL2K3: Catching impossible, probably the worst of the seriesNFL2K4: Special Teams too easyNFL2K5: Special Teams too difficult, otherwise PERFECT**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Game!,"First of all, this game's franchise mode is absolutely terrible compared to madden's. There isn't even a rookie draft! I don't know why the developers did not include a draft but it is absolutely ridiculous. Second of all, the player's look totally unrealistic their bodies are unporportional and they run like robots. There is no depth chart so if you wanted to put a running back at a wide receiver position you couldn't. This game is ridiculously bad. Madden is much better so don't waste your money on this trash. Madden 2004 is definetely the way to go!"
3,Cheesy dialogue,"O.K. The title of the book is what really got me to buy it. One must admit it is catchy. However, I found the dialogue examples rather cheesy and would never talk to my teenage daughter in the way that the author does. She'd think I'd lost my mind! Maybe someone else would find the book more helpful than I did. I am not bashing it, just saying that it wasn't the right book for me."
4,Hitler: The Untold Story,"If YOU want to see some actual World War 2 footage taken in Germany at that time, this is a good one to watch. Unless YOU buy something like this DVD, I don't know when or where you could ever see it."
4,Hitler The Untold Story from Amazon.com,"Excellent, puts the reality of how a corrupt government can sway the people with lies, lies, and more lies, along with promises and government handouts. There are many 'home movies' taken by German citizens during Hitler's rise and fall. The warning 'history repeats itself' makes one shutter. This is a must for any history buff, and a great DVD for all those that enjoy freedom!"
5,Best Edition of Teresa of Avila,"I attend a Secular Carmelite Group (the order Teresa founded) and this is the edition that the Discalced Carmelites use of Teresa's works. Supposedly this is the most accurate translation.I bought it for my Kindle so that I could have Teresa's works, another book we are reading, and my Bible all on the Kindle when I go to meetings. This way, I don't have to drag around three different books! I have found this very helpful. Since the chapters are short it has been pretty easy finding the page the others are on if I know how the paragraph starts."
5,The Best of Marley,"Many reviews have pointed out the huge significance and influence of Bob Marley's music. I just want to say that even though I have many CDs of his wonderful music, including interesting collections of early songs, if I had to keep just one CD, it would be Legend.Marley even did an album in an earlier style, called Rock Steady, with one of his greatest songs: ""Caution."" Collections of earlier music include some of Marley and the Wailer's covers of soul classics which are excellent.However, Legends clearly has his greatest songs including ""Three Little Birds,"" ""Exodus,"" and many others which other reviewers have elucidated quite well.I was surprised that the others did not emphasize my all-time favorite Marley song: ""No woman, no cry."" The live version in Legends is perfection in music. To sum it up, anyone who is at all interested in Reggae music must have this CD."
5,JAH JAH,The best reggae cd ever made!! In my opinion. Listen to this cd and float on over to zion!!! 420
5,the best,"this cd is totaly awesome. any bob marley song you know is on this this album. i dont care if you buy it or download it, you need this cd. its not a cd with a couple of good songs and the rest are crappy. every song on this beast is sweet."
5,A Classic!!!,"This is a great album. It includes many of his great hits, but I thought War, Crazy Baldheads, and So Much Things To Say should have been on there. But then again, you can only fit so much onto 1 CD. My solution: buy all his other CD's after you buy this one. I bought this one because I liked the song ""No Woman No Cry"", and now I own 8 of his CD's. A must have!"
1,Scatched,The cd was scratched through 2 songs so I had to throw it out. Not cool. Nothing like relaxing to bob marley and hearing a replay of a single note over and over again.
3,Bad download,Will not download to my I phone from amazon cloud player I was forced to install the down loader when everything I have is I tunes. From now on its iTunes only
4,Raggae Me!,"I loved this cd; a wonderous mix of freedom, love and spirit. I was pleasantly surprised when I turn this on and noticed immediately the range of people and ages who start bopping around and singing along, from my almost 2 year old granddaughter to my 54 year old husband; Marley's music knows no boundaries. A must-have for anyone's collection, no matter what genre of music they tend to appreciate otherwise. Marley is a genius we lost way too soon. This cd never gets too far away from my reach."
5,A True Classic!!!!,If you are into Bob Marley's music-then this is a CD for you.Every special song is on here.A must have in anyones collection!
1,"LOVE Bob Marley, Despise this album","I'm no fan of greatest hits albums, but this one is the worst. Bob Marley was a prophet and desserved much better than this as a best of. This is a ""what radio would play"" album. Do yourself a favor and get ""Songs of Freedom"" instead if you want a greatest hits of Bob Marley. ""Song"" is more expensive but covers way more of Bob's carer and actually contains most if not all the songs on ""Legend"", and well worth the difference in price. A Legend Bob Marley is, but this album is not."
1,Final Word,"Take your money and throw it off the Grand Canyon. The wind will provide a more entertaining show as it wafts it's way to the ribbon of a river below. Certainly more depth, a better plot and infinitely more appealing scenery to chew on it's way down."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!,I ordered this from Amazon and got it fast so Amazon is not at fault here. This movie is horrible it jumps to bad acting and severely boring killing scenes. At the end it is almost predictable and then the movie is over. It totally sucked!!!
1,Werewolves or Vulgarity?,"Very interesting compliation of shortstories. The stories are well written except for the overwhelming use of profane language. The use of vulgar language in the stories by the writers seemed to take most of the enjoyment of reading away for me. Seems to me other, more suitable, words could have been used. The book is profane!"
4,Outstanding Book Filled with Value,In a genre filled with lightweights this book provides plenty of substance. I definitely recommend it for investors or business people. It demonstrates Buffet's thinking and presents useful concepts that many can apply.
3,Unknown Keaton,"From 1939 to 1941, Buster Keaton starred in a series of low-budget shorts for Columbia Pictures. The two-reel comedies were well-received by audiences, but rarely seen after their initial release. Transferred from excellent 35mm prints, this DVD set includes all 10 of Keaton's Columbia short subjects. Though the two-reelers range from memorable (""So You Won't Squawk"") to dreadful (""The Spook Speaks""), the Great Stone Face is always worth watching. ""Pest From the West"" remains the crown jewel of the series - directed by slapstick master Del Lord. Not surprisingly, it was the only Columbia effort Keaton actually liked."
4,"If you like Julie, you'll like this pictorial book","A pictorial exploration of Julie. There is a little history, some of her Penthouse covers, videos and more. The last half of the book is a collection of photographs and paintings of her. Vallejo, Julie Bell, and Olivia have all done paintings of her. There are also prints from the Heavy Metal movie FAKK^2.A listing of all her appearances in print, video, trading cards, etc. is also in the book. There are 160 pages chock full of Julie Strain.It's not something that will make any literary best seller list, but for those who like photos of beautiful women, it's well ""worth the climb."""
3,espn nhl hockey reveiw,espn hockey is a good game with some things that need some work. The graphics are fair and the gameplay is ok. the player turns aren't very round and the it is very hard to score a goal. most of my games were a final score of 1-0 or 2-0. you can start your own francise which is very cool. there is an air hockey game you play and also check your e-mail. but what i really like is that you can set the time of the period from 1 minute to 20 minutes. another thing i dont like is that it's very difficult to get though the 2 defensemen so im forced to take a slapshot from the blueline which i never score. i think nhl 2004 would probley be a better choice for a hockey game. GO RED WINGS AND MAPLE LEAFS
4,GOOD,"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, BECAUSE IT'S SOFT AND CONFORTABLE. THE COMBINATION OF COLOR IS FINE. IT'S THE BEST OF LACOSTE"
4,Lip-Ink Liquid Eye Liner,I have used this product for several years and have been very satisfied with it. It is very easy to apply compared to other liquid eye liners.
2,the sequel ditched the humor,I was sad to see that the sequel in this series ditched all humor in favor of romance and suspense. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first book for this reason.
1,'Milwaukee'-brand switch-a-roo!,"Item received was neither the color, NOR even the BRAND advertised.Instead, here's what was received:1) A YELLOW sling, vice the grey one pictured (Color matters in my case).2) Not MILWAUKEE brand, as advertised. Surprised they're still in business and not being sued for misrepresentation.3) The brand on the Load Test label is 'lifitez.com', (mispelled on their product). Hard to take that level of quality seriously.4) Shipper's name is liftitez.com? Odd that they couldn't even spell their name write on their product.5) A Blank Load Test label sewn on, numbers HANDWRITTEN IN PEN.6) A Business card was attached to the package, but with someone's personal name at the top of the card and SHARPIE'D out.Too afraid to even test their 'knock-off' product now. Hope Amazon black-balls them from selling knock-off safety equipment."
5,Wonderful Playset,"My five year old got this for Christmas today and it really is very nice. The princesses can sit on the vanity seat while they do their hair and make up in the mirror. The backdrop scene is beautiful, and although it is framed with plastic, the actual scene is made of cardboard. I would have wished it was made of plastic as well.My primary complaint is that although this comes with 12 pairs of shoes (9 for Barbie, 3 for Kelly) it only comes with 3 crowns which I found odd. It also includes 3 bottles of perfume, 3 powder puffs, and 3 hairbrushes. The vanity seat really seats around 3-4 barbies. The spinning accessory holder can get stuck when a crown or other accessory inside gets stuck between the shelf and the wall. Watch out for that, as ours is stuck at the moment and I can't seem to unstick it.I found this to be an excellent buy for the price!"
1,Simply amazing,"Wow, i wish i could be playing this game right now but Amazon.com sucks so bad and don't know anything about when they are getting the game. I ordered the game 12 days ago and still have not got it, the estimated delivery date was the 29th to halloween even though i ordered it the 20th. Amazon is disgusting and horrible and i will never order anything from this website ever again."
5,the game,THIS GAMES IS THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED BUY IT TODAY IT IS BETTER THAN EA SPORTS BASKETBALL 2004.
3,Cool just cuz Ariel is in it...Ü,"This game is not the best, not the worst. Not the funnest, but not exactly boring, Its not good but not bad. Bassically its just there...its fun because its about the Little Mermaid, but theres not really a point to it. I would recommend this to all u little Mermaid Fans out there."
3,The Little Mermaid Review,"This game is good for younger kids. Best features were the lovely graphics, bonus levels, and the fact that you start out as Ariel and her adventures with Ursula, then switch to Melody and her adventures. Recommended for younger audiences only. Older audiences will be semi dissapointed in this game. There is 30 minutes of movie footage (Little Mermaid 1 & 2). Which the game did not need. The footage was longer than the game itself. Bad storytelling. Too short and too easy for my tastes."
5,Lots of Fun,"This game was so much fun. You start out as Ariel and then half way through turn into Melody. This game might be a little too easy for the hard core playstation gamer but is great for me! There's 3 bonus levels that keep you coming back for more! Each level is pretty easy to get through but the bosses Ursala and the other octapus are harder and take some practice. I haven't seen the second movie but now I want to, all the sounds make me want to watch the first one again. The graphics are great and the game play is wonderful, I definently recommend trying this game."
2,it isn't all that..................,"I haven't even gotten through the first ten chapters and I'm exhausted trying to keep up with who is who and who is doing what. If all the expletives were taken out, there probably wouldn't be much of a story not to mention as many pages, however, I will try to get to the end of the book......starting now"
2,Amateur,"I read this book and again was disgusted by Brandie. Flip floppin' back and forth for a writer is not good and is boring to a reader like myself. I read a review by Benta Coulter and I think He/she and friends need to read ""Game Over"" by Azie Faison and hip yourself to some real shxx, you dig. I have seen it all and done it all and ""Game Over"" is where it's at."
5,SDfan,"I am very impressed with this album, Josh has done a fantastic job and People's magazine review is totally off the mark! I am so glad someone has given this young man a chance, I hope him to continue to go far in the industry!!"
3,Amazon reviewers too liberal with 5 star reviews,"Come on people, you give this FIVE stars? As in it's a earth shatteringly important album that everyone should own?"
5,About this cd by Josh Gracin,Im big fan now of Josh Gracin he came to my Home State and peform and that was the first time i had see heim in concert he did a wounderfull job and his wife and daughter came with him and i saw them too which was nice and he music is diffent then today in a way my favorite song is I Want To Live it says it all about him and his music i would recommend this cd for sure.
5,One of my favorite cds of all time!!!,"I first saw Josh on American Idol and I loved him from the minute he walked into his audition and sang ""All Or Nothing."" He hooked me and I ended up watching the whole season of American Idol just so I could hear him sing. From the minute he sang ""Ain't Goin Down"" I knew he was meant to sing country music.I forget how I found out about this cd, but I immediately ran out and got it and I haven't been disappointed. There's not a song on the cd that I don't like.Everyone says their favorite is ""Brass Bed"" but I would have to disagree. My personal favorite is ""Wheels."" It's just something about his voice. I can't really explain it.He's got romantic songs, upbeat songs that make ya wanna dance, patriotic songs, a little bit of everything.I would recommend this cd to fans of pop, country, or ppl just looking for something new to listen to."
2,chaos princess,"Has that country sound even when not strying to sound country, would have gone further if he was in a show such as Nashville Star. He does have that all amercian country boy look you like to cuddle with while he is serananting love songs to ya."
5,Josh's Great CD!,I think Josh's CD is amazing! Not only because I have been a fan of Josh since the begining but it is a very good CD. I have had my friends listen to it and they think it is good and they don't like Josh.
2,OH NO!,"NOT ANOTHER CORNY SUPERHERO? HIS EYES GOT MESSED UP BUT HE IS STILL GOOD LOOKING. A LAWYER BY DAY, SUPER HERO BY NIGHT... SORRY THIS IS NOT WORTH IT! A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. DON'T BUY IT, JUST RENT IT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE BEN AFFLECK!"
1,Boo!,"Omg, this movie was TERRIBLE, ben affleck....need i say more i mean come one ben affleck is in it!! The only reason it gets one star as opposed to no stars is because Jenifer Garner is so beautiful. im so sorry i wasted money on this movie."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I assumed this movie would be generic but more than likely watchably entertaining. Turns out it's neither. It seems more british than american, the way it's edited to barely let you in on what's going on. The establishment and development of characters fits somewhere between slow and non-existant, and as if the premise of a blind superhero wasn't dumb enough the fight scenes seem specifically designed to induce laughter. By the halfway point the movie hasn't created any excitement or set up any plot points for you to anticipate the resolution of, something any decent action movie should do in the first 15 minutes."
4,Take a look at this!,Daredevil has a lot of cool s**t going for it. THE MINUTE IT STARTED THE LOOK OF IT HOOKED ME! Jenifer Garner is DELICOUS (Can't wait for the movie Elektra!)!! Hell even Ben manages to be menacing (Hard to believe I know!)!
2,One word - ....,"3 things keep this from being a great movie. 1. Daredevil DOES NOT KILL! This is a violation of the very core of the character, who believes that the legal system must decide someone's fate. 2. Matt fights Electra in a park in front of a crowd of people, openly displaying his ""powers."" 3. Speaking of powers, Daredevil only has heightened senses, not the ability to jump from a skyscraper and land feet-first without becoming the Human Accordion. Whilie it's necessary to use a little tweaking of the story here and there when bringing a comic that's been running 20+ years to the big screen (see SpiderMan for an example of how to do it properly), the liberties taken with this character were too much."
3,not worth all the hype,"the movie was strictly action, a lot of gore, and many fight scenes. the movement was hard to follow when Daredevil used his ""senses"" at some times but other than that the fight scenes were okay. the plot was horrible and so was the acting for the most part. if you want to see a movie with lots of action,okay fight scenes, and a lot of eye candy this movie's for you then."
4,Worth your money,This movie is not a bad movie like many people put it to be i mean c mon its daredevil and daredevil shows alot in this film you dont have to wait an hour for him to appear only like 20 minutes anyways heres a good hero flick a dark one yes but good kinda reminds me of batman
2,Mediocre,"Young daredevil loses his eyesight, and his other senses pick up. He also loses his father, and vows revenge. He realizes he can use his power for good, and becomes Daredevil to correct the wrongs in the city he lives in. The movie is not super fantastic, I guess I did not really like Ben Affleck in the role, and the fighting scenes just seemed too stiff, and not fluid and natural. I did like the scene where a young daredevil fights three bullies blind was really nice. Colin Fareel as bullseye was excellent casting. He plays crazy really well. Him losing the power to use his hands renders him powerless. Nice touch. I also liked Micheal Clarke Duncas as Kingpen. With his imposing size he made a good villan. The movie ending left room for a potential sequel......which I hope they don't do!!!"
3,I'd find the extra's to be the best part of the DVD,"When I saw the movie I just couldn't get too excited over it. I didn't mind the plotline of 12 yr. old Matt Murdock being blinded by a splash of Industrial waste and soon after developing sonic vision, I just couldn't get into the story.Ben Affleck was all right as adult Matt but I think I liked the young actor who did Matt Murdock at 12 better. Jennifer Garner was good as Elektra but you can see her doing much the same every week on TV in Alias,for what she probably cost they should've given her more screen time. Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin was pretty good although I think he gave up too easily in the climactic battle with Daredevil.The best fight scene in the movie, if you could call it that, was when Elektra and Matt Murdock had a sparring match on some teeter-totters in a playground.The extra's are what I'd most likely buy this one for."
4,Daredevil *Movie DVD* Both Original And Director's Cut.,"I have Both DD Dvd Movies, The Original Double disc and the Director's cut. Garner is very Beautiful and as Electra very good, While Michael Clarke Duncan did a great job as Kingpin, It would have been better had it been true to the comic book. Surprisingly Ben Affleck Did A Great Portrayal of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. and Collin Farrell As ""Bullseye"" is really good too. The Director's cut is just Coolio Added as a Story which could explain alot. Both versions are good. Buy both."
2,Puts me asleep after five minutes.,"This movie is really drawn out. I wish it wasn't because Daredevil is one of my favorite comics. Ben Affleck is horrible as always. Colin Farrell is horrible as Bullseye. His carrer is going down the drain after this and Alexander. Jennifer Garner is ok as Elecktra, I expected more from her. The only character I liked wasn't even in the movie only in the director's cut. Coolio is funny as the man on trial and has a funny line in it. Joe Pantoliano is also good as the reporter. But they can't save a bad movie that was bad enough already."
1,Horrible film!,"This is one of the worst action hero movies ever made! Really, who has heard of a blind super hero? The only reason people went to this film is because girls love Ben Affleck! Come on! There has to be better reason than that! I wouldn't watch this movie again if you gave me a free one!"
2,Bring on the Elektra movie.,"After ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man,"" ""Daredevil"" lets the Marvel side down more than a little; from Ben Affleck's ineffectual turn as the Man Without Fear (not helped by a costume that makes him look, as someone ... noted, like a vinyl couch) via some remarkably poor CGI effects work to banal songs that signpost the action even less subtly than your average episode of ""Charmed,"" it's dark, dull and mostly tiresome.Full marks to Joe Pantoliano, Jon Favreau, the boy who plays our hero's younger self, Colin Farrell (though he could stand to cut out the overacting) and especially Jennifer Garner. If Twentieth Century Fox's mooted spinoff for her character makes it to the cinema, I'll be there front and centre; if they make ""Daredevil II"" I won't even watch it at 11pm on BBC1."
4,"Not as good as Spider-Man, but still very entertaining.","My opinion is that all these comic book movies should have one goal: Create a movie just as good as Spider-Man. Daredevil falls short of Spider-Man, they have a long way to go to make this as good as Spider-Man. Daredevil is very dark and awefully violent, but it's darkness is what gives the movie character. This movie will probably never be better than Spider-Man, or X-Men, or The Incredible Hulk for that matter, but it's better than Blade, and the recent Batman movies. This movie overall wasn't terrific, but I remember leaving the first X-men movie a little dissapointed. But of course I was blown away by the second movie X2: X-men United. So I'd be willing to give Daredevil 2 a try, when a movie has a lot of flaws that leaves a lot of oppertunities to fix things."
4,Improvement over first version...,"This review is for the Director's Cut Blu-ray version of Daredevil which you may have read elsewhere is an improvement over the 103 minute theatrical cut. There is more background to Daredevil's character which really helps the story along, although the movie's script is far from ideal. The dts Master Audio really shines and the video is solid but not quite demo material. For around $15 with free Prime shipping it was too good of a bargain to pass up."
2,Cheddar. Provolone. Mozarella. Swiss.,"In other words: PURE CHEESE!!This has to be the absolute cheesiest comic-book hero flick that Marvel has put out there yet.The dialouge is so melodramatic and cheesy it's almost funny, the plot is paper thin and full of holes, and the acting is bottom-of-the-barrel B-movie bad. Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell are both TERRIBLE actors. This film deserves them both and they both deserve to have it on their resumes.By the end of this flick my eyes were sore from rolling them so many times.The ending tries to leave things open for a sequel. Please, God, don't ever let there be a sequel."
3,3.5,...the movie is kinda cool. bulls eye is tight and that one chick is fine...too bad she died. so its an okmovie but some cool action scenes but not one i wanna c again!
2,"trite dialogue, wooden acting","I really wanted this movie to be good. Really. However, it was quite possibly the worst I've ever seen in the comic booke genre. The dialogue continually tried to be serious in tone, but sometimes was so badly written and delivered that half of the theatre was laughing in places that the director probably didn't intend. The playground combat scene between Ben Affleck and Jennifer was a joke. Colin Farrell and the KingPin were the only redeeming elements of the movie -- they did a great job in their roles. Ben Affleck was terrible. Even his superhero costume of red leather made him look more like the Catwoman than Daredevil. It's worth seeing if you really really love the superhero genre, but prepare to be disappointed."
1,"Shame on you,Marvel!!",The producers of this move and Marvel comics should be ashamed.They raped a perfectly good comic with this monstrosity of a movie.I think a more appropriately title comic hero movie for Ben Affleck might be the Fat Retarded Janitor.
1,A bunch of super lunatics,"When we saw the ads for Daredevil on TV, we thought ""Wow, what a cool movie!"" So we went to see it in theatres. Big, big mistake. The only thing that made it slightly more tolerable was the soundtrack. Excellent music, but the plot and acting in the movie were definitely lacking. In a nutshell, the plot was everybody getting revenge on everyone else. Oh the drama! You can only have so many people who hate each other before it starts to get old. Of course it didn't help that everyone in the movie was slightly insane. Who on earth would get a target imprinted into their skull? Who wears pleather leggings? Who kills people with paper clips and playing cards? This show needs some serious help. Unfortunately, I fear that it is beyond salvaging. And then the closing line. ""This city doesn't need a guardian angel. It has a guardian devil."" How enthralling."
1,WTF is this all about. -2 stars.,"The casting director in this should be dragged out into the street and shot. Ben AFLACT as Daredevil/Matt Murdock? Colin Ferril as Bullseye? Michael Clarke Duncan as Wilson Fisk the Kingpin? Jennifer Garner as Electra? What the f*** is this s***? Who wrote this s*** and what the hell were they smoking when they did? This movie was more boring than one of Triple H's speaches. WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T GET TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. I had to check my pulse every five seconds to see if I was still alive. There is no plot. The action is boring. Overall I give this movie -2 stars for casting, content and plot."
2,even though its Director's cut,"This movie may be better with the added footage, but that does not make Ben Afleck a better superhero. I'm not a Ben Afleck hater, but the choreographed fights are a pain to watch. There could have been many other actors to play the role of DD much better. I suppose they just wanted a big name to sell tickets, but that's where they flopped. Jennifer Garner does well along with the others for a movie that is only so-so anyway, but I just didn't enjoy watching Afleck pretend that he knows some kind of martial arts with his limited flexability. This is why there will not be a sequal."
1,Horrible!,"I can't write an completely spoiler free review, so be warned:A *defense* lawyer, in the second scene in this film is prosecuting a rapist. Deciding that vigilante justice is needed, he kills the man for date raping a woman he doesn't know. Rough justice, but it's a movie, right? So why does his character refuse to kill the man who murdered *his own father*? Because, Afflect says, ""He's the hero.""Skip this movie. They don't get any worse."
1,Dare to beSTUPID!!!!!!,"The worst Superhero movie EVER! Ben Affleck can't act, neither can Jennifer Garner. BAD Graphics and directing. Don't waste your time!!!! Buy The Hulk instead!"
4,A Well Remake of the Comic Book,"Daredevil was, at first, a new character to me. His comic books, when they were first released, did stir some emotion. Yet, I don't believe it was as good as Spiderman or the other Marvel characters. However, this movie is in relation to Daredevil and knowing that movies made by Marvel is worth seeing, I took a chance and watched the DVD. I have no regrets or second thoughts about the movie. It wasn't exactly breathtaking or exhilirating, but the story and plot was well stated and shown. The story of a 12-year old boy being blinded by biohazardous waste, losing his father at 12, becoming a successful lawyer, and New York's vigilante hero is an interesting story. Showing the different periods of his life, the movie made smooth transition through time. Overall, the movie was well made and is a worthy collectors item for Marvel fans."
4,A slight improvement over the theatrical release!,"If you want a more detailed review of this movie, read the theatricalversion review for this movie...This will focus on the changes:What I liked about it:1. The movie gave us more info on the characters and the plot!2. Some under-foot characters got extra time in this version!What I didn't like was:1. Elektra had a more violent death than in thetheatrical version!If you liked the theatrical version, or were okay with it, you might like thisversion better! It's worth the price, go buy it!My grade B+ or four stars!"
4,great!,"many spiderman fans will continue to trash what they see as the competiton. they will put down daredevil for being ""cliche"" while supporting a film with a green goblin and lines like ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and ask you to believe that one isn't cliche. truth is that both films are cliche comic book movies and both are very entertaining. the major shortcoming of d.d. is that the directors cut was cut down and it's obvious that we missed quite a bit in the theatrical version. the directors cut will be better and i can't wait."
2,You'd think it would be good,"You'd think that with such an all-star lineup (Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell) they couldn't go wrong. You'd also think after the huge success of Spiderman that this movie would only end up in dead competition with it. Also, judging from the previews, the movie looks great. SO WRONG! I was laughing the entire time; the corniness was unbelieveable, the ending completely sucked."
4,This got a bad rap,"This movie was a lot better then I expected (just goes to show you that you cant always trust what reviewers have to say). I watched this with my wife and son and all three of us enjoyed it. True it was a little silly in parts but it was a lot more believeable then say ""Charlies Angels"" or ""The Hulk"". This was a fun movie to watch and unlike a lot of movies in this genre I never got bored watching it. It had some very nice camera work and some really good special effects as well as some of the most interesting villains Ive ever seen."
2,helpp!!,"K....THIS IS NOT REALLY A REVIEW BUT ILL JUST SAY THAT THE MOVIE IS OK.....I WANTED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG WHEN THEY SHOW MATT MURDOCK AS A KID ON THE ROOFTOP WITH HIS DAD, HITTING THE PUNCHING BAG...RIGHT AFTER THE HOSPITAL SCENE..I LIKE THAT SONG VERY MUCH BUT I DONT KNOW THE NAME OF IT.SO WILL SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE!!!"
2,Just not feeling it,"I admit to not being a comic book fan, but agree there have been some excellent movies based on them including Spiderman, Superman, and X-Men. I don't think Daredevil will fall into that category.The movie is dark and reminiscent of the original Batman movie. Affleck is believeable as Matt Murdoch, a lawyer who as a young boy is blinded by a toxic chemical spill. The character turns to a vegilanti after seeing his father killed by hired thugs. The movie is slow to start, has not predictable wire fight sequences, and lacks a concrete story line. Or more importantly tries to tie too many loose ends up in one story. Murdoch discovers the man that kills his father is the same man that is running the cities organized crime ring and hires the hit on his love Electra. Again reminiscent of Batman.I wouldn't bother with this one."
4,Under-rated...,"I think this movie got alot less credit then what it really deserved. I think people just didn't like it as much because DareDevil wasn't the kind of super hero with the fancy powers or gizmos. In my opinion it was better than I actually thought it would be. Before seeing X2 this was the best marvel super-hero movie yet. I think that the cast really pulled through with their characters, and the DareDevil costume was done really well. *Conclusion* This was a really good movie in my opinion and I don't care what other people say about it, it's still one of my favorites."
2,Daredevil.. sigh.,"I really wanted to like this movie. Going into the theater, I felt slighly excited, I have been a long time fan of the Frank Miller version of Daredevil, and I had heard that director had brought Miller in to help with the film's visuals. So I settled in, and watched. The movie starts fast, and quickly moves through daredevil's origin, which I enjoyed - then they have a very good scene of the boy daredevil being woken by a booming drip and we see his radar ""vision"" working. Then it went downhill fast.Some of my major problems with the film was I just didnt belive daredevil did those crazy moves. He jumps at least 10 feet down, falls another ten feet, and then again.. I expected him to be at least a few inches shorter when he hit the ground. And there is one more thing at the end that bugs me... but I won't give that away.It does fullfill as an action movie, and you gotta see like 40 million dollars in action flyin across the screen. But don't think too much."
3,Choose another edition,I bought this book to use with my Bible study class. The material is good but this particular edition does not include the division into numbered chapters that the rest of my class follows & there are numerous typos that require deciphering.
5,EPD,A powerful read! Andrew Murray has great insight from the Holy Spirit into this topic. This would be a great read and teaching for new Christians to have a deeper level of understanding of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ.
5,Exquisite pop concealing politically charged lyrics,"I missed the Style Council when they were topping the charts (in the UK) in the early to mid 80s, because I avoided pop and favored punk/post-punk. I recently picked up this album and Cafe Bleu because, over the years, I've developed a greater appreciation for melody. The pleasantness of the music can be a bit deceiving though. The political content of this album is as incisive as any offered at the time by American or British hardcore bands. Some of the lyrical content is a bit dated, but much involves the damaging effects of globalization on community - still a very relevant concern."
1,What a great... light cover?,"i ordered the drums, and i got a light cover instead. they processed a return about 2 days after it was sent out. and about 2 days after that i got a metal light cover in the mail. i still got my return. they obv are confused how their warehouse works?"
1,very disappointing,"I fell instantly in love with their first album, and recommended it to everyone I knew whether they were francophone or not. It was seamless, romantic, profound.This new effort is shallow, self-indulgent (track 9 for instance) and poorly conceived. It doesn't cohere, it's not musically rich or intriguing or unexpected."
1,This Dinky Thing?,I tried to buy this for my kid for Christmas and sent it back. It's tiny and stupid and overpriced. He'd break it in a heartbeat. It cost way more than $1.99 when I bought it in December. Lame.
5,great album,"Michael Ball is at his best as always he puts qoo percent into his singing He sings with such emotion a really great classy singer with a great style of his own. I highly recommend thi scd or any of his cds Most contain really romantic songs a lot of broadway show songs, ballads pop , a little of everything"
5,The little camera that could.,"I narrowed my choice in digital video cameras to this Handycam and a similar Panasonic model -- the SDR-H200. Sony won the battle due to what I see as a superior picture. I compared the two models side by side at Circuit City and it wasn't even close. The Panasonic, while displaying exceptional coloration, appeared blurry. Sony's DCR-SR200 has an image that is crystal clear with incredibly sharp lines. The controls are also nice with the touch screen LCD. In contrast, I found the Panasonic's thumb-toggle switch to be rather annoying.Overall, the DCR-SR200 feels great in the hand and takes beautiful video."
3,Good,Works good in day time. Its not that clear if the background is dark. Can't able to shoot if it dark with a small lighting.
1,*DONT BUY* *STAY AWAY*,"I have owned this camcorder for about 1 year now. Its on its way to get repaired by Sony for the 2nd time. It just dies on me, and wont come back on. The base for charging and transfering videos is a joke. Im sure thats the next thing to malfucntion. The first time they fixed it they managed to gave me a 90 day warranty. It died again after 98 days!"
3,Product confounds me...,"I'm a little confused by this product. I use it as instructed, and it works most of the time. Sometimes it does not work, however. You can tell when it works, because the fire ants all come to the surface of the mound and die...that's good... But, sometimes they don't die, they just move to a different area of the lawn. I use it the same way every time, so I'm not sure what the deal is. Still, this stuff works better than anything else I've come across. Even if it doesn't kill them...it makes them go away."
3,"Good Knife, defective handle","After some year of use, this knife handle started to desintegrate by itself, up to the point it finally fell off completelly. Now I am looking for a good replacement, before I try to make one by myself."
4,a finely crafted piece of music,"This is a great album, merging various styles to create a sound all his own. Brooks is a master, and this album is an example of that."
4,Always enjoyable,I have enjoyed Heyer's characters for decades. She has such a clear grasp of the times and manners that the reader experiences no difficulty in entering their world.
2,No Heyer's best,"It took me forever to slog through this book because I didn't find the plot or the characters that interesting. With the exception of the Major, and perhaps Vincet Darracott, most of the characters that populate this book are caricatures - the combative patriarch, the silly fob, the spineless coward, etc. I also wondered if people really talked like that back during the regency era- in long winded passages that take up almost entire pages. It is especially frustrating for me to read those long winded dialogues because they more often than not add nothing to the plot and are so heavily in cant as to be almost indecipherable.Also, unlike other Georgette Heyer books, the romance is almost entirely absent so I did not even have that to induce me to turn the pages."
4,Vastly Amusing,"This may be the Heyer book with the most amusing scenes--and yet, it also has some of the most serious subplots of any of her Regencies (smuggling, and familial relationships gone awry). The conversations between the hero and his various sniping and sarcastic relatives are comic gems that I have read over and over. As in many of my favorite Heyer's, the romantic element is subordinate to the bigger picture, but it is satisfying nonetheless (and has its own delightful comic moments!)."
1,Hmm...,"I got this thinking that it would be better than the savon de marseille soaps. The minute I opened the box, I was hit by this really strong smell. One thing is for sure, this stuff will linger on your skin. The scent was all over the box and it wasn't even out of the packaging yet. Unfortunately, unless you like the way it smells right away, you won't enjoy this product. It reminded me of one of those old lady scents, so I returned it."
5,Virtuosity in Unison. This is how all Live Performances Should Be!,"If there were 6 stars available for a rating, I'd give it to Level 42 and ""A Physical Presence"". Although I am a bit biased being a huge and long time fan of the band, there is still no denying that this live performance is as ""tight"" as a band can be in a live performance.Make no mistake, this is where Level 42 shines. Their recordings made you a fan, but their live performances make you a devotee. If you ever wanted to hear near perfection through every facet of a performance, this is the CD for you.My advice - Listen to this with some decent headphones and you'll hear a modern symphony that will amaze you every time."
1,Don't waste your money,I didn't find that this product helped the bag lettuce I buy keep any longer. Save your money and buy a lettuce keeper from Tupperware.
2,Not worthy of Steve Lawrence's talents.,"I have the original lp's where the songs on this CD were first published. I was looking forward to getting updated versions without all the clicks and pops. What a disappointment. The sound was abysmal. The producers of this CD ought to be ashamed of themselves. The old lp's, even with clicks and pops, are still much better."
3,Not completely happy,"Product is adequate, and does seem to draw heat/blood to the area. However, wearing as loose as possible without it moving around as instructions suggest offers no benefit. Tighter and it is like a tournique. I have been unable to find a comfortable compromise. I would try a gel base product for compression without cutting circulation."
3,Same price as ortho supply store.,"The price is comparable, 3 stars for wishing it would cinch a little tighter, the velcro will wear out if not taken care of."
2,Proofreader Needed !,"The layout and content of this book is perfect for the individual who basically understands project management but wants to forego a more massive text to pass the IT Project+ exam. The frustrating thing is there are way too many errors in this guide. I found a number of individual questions where the answer key was just plain wrong. Not to mention that there are a few whole sections where every answer in the answer key is wrong. I guess someone changed around the sections but forgot to change the answer key. Since this is the main point of this concise guide, I cannot recommend it."
1,Many errors in the answer key!,"I am a PMP and purchased this book to study for the much more basic IT Project+. The book does a decent job of covering the basics in an efficient manor. However, there and SEVERAL blatant errors in the example questions. There are even several questions where is says ""Select two answers"" - but the back of the book has something other than two! To the best of my knowledge, the author has not released a corrected answer key.I would recommend this book for the text only - find a practice test elsewhere!"
3,Not bad,I remember watching this movie back when I was in high school. I never really liked it because I don't like the way Cuba Gooding Jr act in this movie. Now years later my husband wanted to watch Boyz in the Hood the other night because we haven't watched it in some time. Being older and paying more attention to details I realized this movie isn't bad. But I'm still not crazy about Cuba's acting.
4,Great Movie,Some very powerful performances make this by Cuba Gooding Jnr and Lawrence Fishbourne make this a movie that makes you think. It shows contrasts between different sort o teens in the hood. Tre(Gooding) is a good kid in a bad neighbourhood trying to stay out of trouble. Ricky is trying to make a better future for himself and his family by going to college playing football. Doughboy is a thug in and out of prison and with no prospects. If you like hood movies you'll love this but buy Menace II Society first.
4,Sad depiction of reality,"I can imagine thousands of stories like this must take place in the hood. So so sad. It makes me sad to see it on screen but I think it's an important story. Black men without fathers, single mothers raising their children, crackheads and drugs in the neighborhood, police helicopters circling overhead, drive-by shootings taking place, black men going in and out of jail, early teenage pregnancies, neighborhoods with trash everywhere...just not the way to live.There was one part in the movie that was a little weird though...when Tre's father starts talking about how gun shops and crack is brought into black neighborhoods b/c society wants them to kill each other.....that was just too conspiracy-theory.The ending is so sad."
5,"A gripping tale about South Central, LA","Cuba Gooding Jr.'s best film he ever been in. The power of the film has yet to be matched as most modern interpretations of street life prove to be violent stylizations. While Singleton has taken a couple missteps along the way, this film still stands up rather well by todays standards. The motives and actions appear realistic, especially Doughboy's thirst for revenge. A good film, which not only helped improved Laurence Fishburne's career, but introduced us to Gooding Jr."
4,Scrubby scrub scrub...,"I have always loved 'Scrubs', and was absolutely thrilled to see it had been released on DVD. It certainly did not disappoint.Honestly, this is a really magnificant series, and well worth the money. The humour is accessible and endearing and the characters are wonderfully likable. 'Scrubs' has a wonderful inspiring aspect that avoids the undue sentimentality of so many other sitcoms.I think the second series is funnier than the first, though I love the focus on character growth in the first series. But really, both are extraordinarily worthwhile buys, if simply because of the sheer number of viewing hours.So if you missed an episode or just love Scrubs...this is a must!"
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"I have always loved 'Scrubs', and was absolutely thrilled to see it had been released on DVD.

3,"It's a little bit Lode Runner, and a little bit Pitfall.","The game is very similar in design to another classic game, Lode Runner -- in Monster Rancher Explorer, you're a tomb explorer who can drop and destroy crates with a simple wave of your hand. it has Dozens of puzzles, Battery save, Link cable support for two players, and Only for Game Boy Color"
1,arrived broken.....................,"The watch arrived broken from Maxi Aids, and we haven't received the new one yet, its been over 3 weeks."
1,Be Careful!!!,"My daughters were playing with the blond younger sister. After ""charging"" the doll in order for it to spin on the floor, she put the doll on the floor. My other daughter's hair got caught in spinning foot and pulled out a penny size chunk of hair out! Left a bald spot the size of a penny! Thank goodness she didn't bleed!!! Be careful!!!"
4,Excellent,"If your a mob freak like me any mob book is a great buy. This doesn't dissapoint. buy it, you won't be sorry."
2,Stick with 2003,"First off, let me start out by saying that the online aspect of this game is simply awful. Sega must fix it's network or else be laughed out of the online business. If you're used to the smooth play of Madden 2004 online, don't expect anything close to that w/ this game. The play runs very sluggish and freezes often in the middle of a game, it isn't my connection either because many people complain of the same problems.Secondly, 2003's version had better game play. The checking was better last year, this year's players move very fast and are difficult to get a good hit on. It is very easy to score on one timers but nearly impossible to score w/ slap shots. They got rid of the slide move that you could do to block shots also for some odd reason.All in all you're better off staying with 2003 and trying out NHL 2004 by EA Sports, they probably have a better online network."
3,Good (for the price),"It's an ok desk, I guess...it's flat and things stay on it. The color is much darker than shown, and the biggest problem was that none of the parts were labeled. Was able to figure it out, but only after multiple tries at assembling, then taking it apart and re-assembling. Would have been much easier if the parts had letters on them like the pictures. If you are not mechanically inclined, or have low frustration tolerance, this may not be the desk for you."
2,Totally disappointed,I was sent the wrong size product then i returned it and they sent the wrong size again and ups has not returned to pick it up so i can be refunded
5,More about Huna than Shamanism,"This book is more about Huna (a shamanic religion of Hawaii) than Shamanism.If you are interested in Huna. this is one of the better books I have read.If you are interested in Shamanism; I recommend the following.""Secrets of Shamanism...""Jose and Lena Stevens""Shamanism: as a spiritual practise..."" Tom Cowan""The Way of the Shaman"" Michael Harner"
2,fwoggy,Well I didn't like the fact that it gave no real info about the tracks and things so i honestly wish that I hadn't waste my time on buying this book because the info that i needed wasn't even covered.
3,generally worth watching,"The man who could cheat death is the stand out, killer bees was mildly entertaining and a bit better than expected, while the skull is less than was expected with its quality cast.No complaints about the disc quality.Scant extras if any. No subs.The man who could cheat death, very interesting. 3 viewsThe Skull I'm a big fan of Cushing and Lee, but I could care less if I saw this one again. 1 viewKiller bees, passable entertainment a bit patchy, so I'm most likely going to watch it again, but I give it 1 view. I have watched killer bees again and its better the second time around mostly for its excellent framing devices which are classic hammer style. It begins with the main actress doing a lip sync for a television broadcast, when she faints dead away the music continues ironically the lyrics are ""stop the music!"". Casting could have been better, the old guy is too young and has some hasty makeup."
4,"Not the best, but certainly not the worst.","This product defintely serves its purpose, and keeps all of my DVDs in great condition. It is certainly not nearly as nice in quality as a Case Logic, but it is what it's worth. I would recommend this for anyone that is looking for an affordable CD/DVD case. It does its job effectively, and I would purchase again if I needed to."
5,I really like this Movie!,This ia a great movie that all ages will enjoy. Old Yeller truly bonds with the most unlikely family member. The story of Old Yeller's devotion to his family is heart warming!
1,IT'S A SUCKY BOOK!,This book was the most boring book I have ever read! I had to read it for school and I hated it so much! I suffered through the whole book and had to do like five projects on it!!! I had to have my mom read it to me because evertime I read it by myself I would fall asleep by the first half of the chapter... THIS BOOK SUCKS SO BAD! DON'T READ IT! DON'T BUY IT! It's the worst book I've ever read! Believe me I have read many books and I'm only a kid! I HATE THIS BOOK WITH A PASSION!!!!
4,Good compilation CD,"Generally I dislike compilation pieces. I suppose they are mainly designed for someone trying to figure out whether they like classical music or not.However, the performances on this disc are better than the run-of-the-mill potpourri disk. The 'Summer' from Vivaldi's Four Seasons is powerfully played and a good performance (Orchestra di Milano, Benito Rossi, violin). Even the sadly overplayed Canon of Pachelbel is forcefully played with a lively tempo (Sinfonie Orchester Graunke Munich). The piano work on Schmann's 'Riding Piece Op. 68' is good as well (not attributed).All in all, a nice piece to play when you have non-classical music loving friends over for dinner or a social gathering. It is also a nice CD to have playing when you are just relaxing with a glass of wine.Maybe it will prompt some to go out and purchase complete works by a particular composer.Recommended."
2,"Still Etta, But Disappointing","Looking at the play list, I was really anticipating a power perfomance by one of my favorite R&B power vocalists. This, however, was not to be. To me this CD had the feel of someone going through the motions and pandering to an audience who wanted to see a ""canned"" Etta James performance. Too bad, because she can really be a force of nature when she's at her best. Check out The Essential Etta James' version of ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" to see what I mean.Overall: OK, but disappointing."
5,Ancient Echoes-- A Critical Review,"I discovered this cd just by accident. And, after reading a few reviews, I got a good sense of what to expect.The album is magnificent.At one point, I was listening to it once a day for several weeks. The pronunciation is closer than you might expect from American voices. The instrumentation is above par as well. The linear notes are thorough and the songs are transliterated so that you can follow along.What's also special is that there's a picture of about a dozen or so Middle Eastern instruments used in the production on the back cover of the booklet.Sound reproduction. 4 1/2 stars. I deduct a half star because on the 1st track there's an annoying echo/ feedback for about 10 seconds that (in all honesty) should have been eliminated in post-production. But, overall, the choral/ harmony is excellent.I wish they'd do a follow-up."
3,websters college dictionary,so far so good. the diction is fine. the pages are printed on paper that is thin and easy to tear. the print is smeared in spots. wd.
4,"A good read, but cluttered","It takes a lot of work to tease a coherent plot out of this baby. But I'm used to reading Pynchon, so what the hey."
4,Used for *WORDS with Friends*,"My son, on Words, uses some words that are accepted that are not yet in the Dictionary. BUT I have been able to *get* him on words I have found in it."
5,Darwin's Army,"This album is so much fun, especially for a John Stewart fan , but even if you are not. You can just play this album over and over. Great traveling music. An eclectic group of songs. Some old favorites that get you singing right along and some wonderful new songs and terrific harmonies. A must for any John Stewart fan and just pure joy for anyone else.You can tell they are having a blast playing together."
1,Nostalgic Disappointment,"Billed as John Stewart's first group since The Kingston Trio, he should have quit while he was ahead. This is a case of pure crass commercialism, using John's name and several old Kingston Trio hits to bilk a few dollars from an unsuspecting public. John's voice is long gone, cracking and off-key. Buffy's rendition of Mariah is listless and dull. In all, the album sounds like a gagage band attempt to (unsuccessfully) make a first album. This material is clearly something that should be provided for free on MP3.com.Lest I be accused of sounding like the inspiration for something like Rick Nelson's Garden Party, if John et. al. don't want to be compared with the past, they should drop the reference to The Kingston Trio, as well as the songs that helped to make that group famous."

2,Sketchy and short on description,"English words are simply given a single word in Farsi, with just a grammatical indication (verb or noun). No descriptions at all, really"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Hi,I purchased the book two months ago, and then gave it to my public library. Why? because the book bases its arguments with 1980's knowledge, and discusses about 5% of the brain nutrients that actually impact intelligence. I suggest buying books written after 2004 as most brain nutrient research has been in the 1990's and 2000's.There are some very good books on Brain Intelligence from diet and nutrients from Amazon.com, but this is not one of them."
2,"""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" Audio CD","This is primarily an instrumental recording. I wanted a cd with Christmas songs for my 20 month old grandbaby so she could learn to sing the old favorites. This is not a good cd for children. I also got ""Frosty The Snowman"" from Amazon and she loves that cd. If you're looking for a children's Christmas cd, I recommend that one."
1,What a Dissapointment,"I am utterly dissapointed in this game. The controls are too picky, passing is a pain, 24/7 mode is a rip off from EA Sports, and is extremely boring anyway, the dunks don't look that great, rather kind of cheesy in my opinion, and the music is so annoying you have to have the volume muted. Not to mention if you try a spin move, or juke, expect a charge call no matter what you do. I was really looking forward to ESPN NBA Basketball, and ended up wasting $50.00 on a pitiful product."
2,Skip it.,"I always enoy a stupid horror movie, especially David Decocteaus films Voodoo Acadmey and the Brotherhood trilogy. However, this one is just plain bad. The leeches is the thing that ruined this movie. They are so poorly made that all it is, is someones hand in a puppet wiggling up people's body. You can actually see the persons arm! The plot was lame, about a bunch of swim jocks caught up on steroids who are attacked by giant leeches. I will advise you all to stay away, and even David Decocteau fans will be very disappointed, like I was."
3,I thought it would be better.,"Im not gonna say it wasent good because I did enjoy it, but it is not how I thought it would be.It was kinda corny but i thought that the storyline was very creative.I liked the sex appeal that the actors brought to the film and I liked each of there styles of clothing that they wore when they were not in the pool or in there swimsuits. Especally the nerdy biology dude I loved when he was in all black it gave him sort of a gothic look."
1,words fail me,There are no words in the Oxford English Dictionary to describe how awful this movie is. It is in the truest sense of the word a HORROR movie. I think that it is highly unlikely that any of the people in it will want it on their CV. Can I have my money back please?
2,"AV cable dangerously thin, irreplaceable","i chose these speakers chiefly because i wanted a cheap system that matched my macbook. i figured, as long as it has a subwoofer the sound will be bigger and certainly better than my laptop's. and it was, for a while. at first i was disappointed with the short and dangerously thin AV cord, but the great sound quality made up for its shoddy construction. it performs well on a wide range of volumes, up to really loud. however, the AV cord began to like, poop out within 7 months of use: the cord would only work if you held it at certain angles. today, it plays no sounds at all. tried screwing off the backboard of the woofer to replace the cord with one i have, but it is wired into the whole machine (not a simple plug-in).why would the manufacturers cheap out like that?"
1,This was the worst bra ever.,"It lost its hold after a few hours. I am heavy busted and with milk it's worst, so this bra is not good for holding up anything that a nursing bra should. It seems as though the straps kept getting longer and longer as the minutes rolled by. By the time I took it off it was a hula-hoop around the band and the length of suspenders at the strap, but did not support as well as suspenders. A picture is worth a thousand words, but this picture lied."
1,This is a bad design,There are exposed seams crossing the inside of this bra. I found it extreemly painfull to wear as the seams rubed on a sensative area (I don't want to get to graphic). I'm not nursing yet but clearly a nursing bra that causes pain is a bad design. It was supportive and others might find it more comforatable than I did but I'm returning the one I bought.
5,awesome!,"simply beautiful, instrumental versions of favorite christmas carols............love the classical guitar & harp..........perfect background music for elegant christmas parties"
1,not the solution i imagined,"Was so excited to get my spanx - and, well, unfortunately it is so not the miracle worker i expected it to be. basically, this is the honest truth: if you're overweight, it 'aint gonna help much. i'm a size 12 and thought this would make me look like a 10. It doesn't. you're just really uncomfortable.I had a pair when i was a size 4 and needed to smooth out a few lines and suck in my tummy a bit and, yes, it did the trick then. but at size 12, now, forget about it - the teeny weeny bit it helps just doesn't make the pain worth it."
3,Size ranges need adjusting,"I am near the top of the ""C"" category, but well within it for 5' 6"" so I took a chance on ordering that size. The Spanx Power Panties Panty rolls at my waistline, and pinches my ""bottom."" Perhaps the next size up would be the right size for me. I believe the company needs to review their sizing. On the positive side, the legs do not roll and do not pinch. The knowledge that my derrière line is smooth is reassuring. I will wash and wear this pair a few times before deciding to order a ""D."""
3,Waistband rolls,"The waistband rolls and it is uncomfortable when this happens - if you happen to be in a long meeting and can't get to the ladies' room to fix it, be prepared to be uncomfortable until you can leave!"
4,Power panties are the bomb!,"I couldn't imagine that something that looks and acts like a girdle could be comfortable, but they are! I love wearing them with my jeans. They make me feel thinner and what could be better than that?A satisfied customer."
1,Didn't do anything for me,"I am a fairly thin person with a little extra weight in the upper thigh area and was hoping these could minimize the look under dresses or more fitted pants, but unfortunately they didn't seem to do anything for me. They were very tight and hard to get on, and once I did I still had the same lumps and bumps. Very dissapointed."
4,Spandex,this is my second pair of spandex. I really like them especially under a dress or skirt. They keep me cool and comfortable. I just wish they cost less. If they were twenty instead of thirty dollars then I could buy more
1,Rolls at waist and legs and static,"My height and weight pu me smack dab in the size B. I tried them on at home with the dress I was going to wear. The tummy part rolled down. I figured that wasn't optimal but it was still usable. While I was out the panties caused so much static, I was embarassed to stand up. I used some water in the restroom to reduce the static. A couple of hrs into wearing them, the leg hem started rolling up my thighs, creating once again embarassing bulges. Not sure if the sizing chart was wrong or what happened, but I sure won't be wearing these expensive underwear again."
2,Popular Name - Poor Quality,"This is my second time to buy Spanx brand shapewear. Normally I buy a store brand. True to my last experience, these didn't last. I bought them and wore them for the first time on 6/29/11. I have worn them about twice a week since and by the middle of July they were already ripped at the seam. I have a similar black pair that I bought at a department store for half the price that have lasted over a year and I am still wearing them with no rips or tears. In my opinion, Spanx brand is definitely not worth the extra cost."
2,rolls up,They work fine until I sat down and the waistband rolled up so that when I stood up I was constantly having to fix them.
5,Perfect Fit,I highly recommend these as the perfect way to hide panty lines and look slim around the tummy and thighs. They are absolutely made from the best material and are easy enough to wear through the day
1,Horrible!!! Do not purchase if you have even a tiny bit of fat on your body.,"I did not wear these for the outfit/occasion I had ordered for and have promptly returned. I am 5'2'' and fairly slender at 105 lbs. Sometimes when I am bloated or drink an excess of water, my lower tummy expands out. Since I was wearing a dress that fit like a glove in a jersey material, I did not want any bulges apparent from anywhere.First, the item completely cuts the waste area. It came about an inch above my belly button and managed to squeeze my skin creating two bulges cutting into my figure. When I tried to lower it, even worse! Second, the front seam which ran right along the middle (lined with belly button) caused the top to curl forward and could also be seen through the fabric of my dress.Overall, I am very disappointed with the product."
5,SPANX'S TO U,I have used this product for a while and all day comfort!!!Amazon has a great price!!!!Just make sur u pick the proper control for what u want to adjust :)
2,STANDING ROOM ONLY,"I've long been searching for a meansTo improve the way I look in jeans.Then I found a Spanx that binds us,Shapes and smoothes what is behind us.So here am I all sleek and svelte,But such sore feet I've never felt!For while this may be what I fit in,It's not something I can sit in.- Gail Cooke"
2,They roll,"I have a short waist so the long or full body shapers never fit me right, so I decided to try the shorts and at first they seemed pretty good. They were comfy, smoothed out the body nicely but like other reviewers said as soon as you sit down or simply bend over they roll. It is very annoying!"
2,Not the best of Anne Murray.,This album was a dissapointment for me. I love Anne and saw her in Las Vegas but I felt this album did not have a very good sound.
4,Interesting,"This little book gives an overview of the life and times of St Columba, the guy who established the monastery at Iona, off the Isle of Mull, Scotland. It delves into his Irish past and gives the reasons why he felt he had to leave, and why he headed for Scotland. It's not a large book, but it does provide some historical insight. Anyone who is going, or has been to Iona, and wants to know more about the man, this book provides just enough to wet the appetite."
5,I love this book,"I should reveal my conflict of interest here: This book is published by APress and I'm currently writing a book for APress. And there are a couple of good ADO books out there, from other publishers. This one is my favourite. The book covers all of ADO and, more importantly, gives you the author's guidence on how and when to use those features. I learn something new everytime that I pick it up."
4,fun splat mat,Washes up easily in washing machine and we love the eco/kid friendly material. It was a little smaller than I expected but I guess I should have paid a little more attention to the dimensions!
2,Not the best that Ms. Sawyer has done,"I purchased this book thinking that this book would match the drama, the anticipation, the emotion of Ms. Sawyer's other book, The Winter Prince.The characters were so well-rounded and the intensity of the language and passion was palpable. I loved The Winter Prince. I couldn't wait to read the next page.This book, The Chase, was such a disappointment in comparison. I was bored throughout."
2,Like the syrup out of a marmalade bottle,"Pretty mediocre , not worth the money.Flavor is dull, and not sharp.Imagine marmalade with no orange preserves in it.Bland flavour..."
5,THE BEST,I Played it at my friends house and we stayed up all night playing seasons. IT IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!! to write me im at Gorilla@AOL.com
3,How many episodes are in the set???,I thought they produced 13 episodes but it appears only 7 episodes are in the set. My memory must not be serving me too well. I remember this show coming on NBC as a mid-season replacement (1980-81) on Saturday nights. The late Brandon Tartikoff talks about this series in his book The Last Great Ride and how he couldn't understand why it wasn't a success with the conservative tide sweeping the country on the heels of Reagan's election.
4,Memory,"Actually I find this show more interesting and action packed than I originally remember after viewing the show 25 years ago.Its amazing this show made it to DVD,after its early cancellation and low ratings...I am thinking the recent Walking Tall movies (The Rock)have led the maker to seek some financial gain.And for me thats ok....glad to have this show on DVD and I hope everyone buys a copy.Its not the horrid disaster that it has been widely reported all these years."
5,I miss this item.,I sure wish these kleenex were manufactured again. They are the only ones to use when you have a cold.
1,Do not buy this movie.,There is no hot blond tied up in this movie at all!What a rip off. The two women in the movie are aboutaverage at best. Save your money for anything else.No blond anywhere in this so called movie!
2,jollybluegiant,This product is average. The internal speakers are a grade C at best. External speaker connection is bare wire. Overall this product is worth the $85 price and not any more.
4,Not bad,I bought 3 of 224 capacity CD wallets by Velocity on a deal for (...). They are perfectly useful. Now I have no CD storage problems for years to come. The only problem I had with the purchase was that they offered only one rebate per person. So I had to pay full price for the other two. I am still satisfied.
4,Great syrup for flavored water,"I don't like drinking plain water, but I'm trying to cut back on sodas. I decided to try Torani syrups to flavor my water (1 oz per 20 oz cup, so less than half the calories of soda).I've never had huckleberries before, so I wasn't sure what to expect (I purchased it based on good reviews on Amazon & other sites). I'm still not sure how to describe it. Although the Huckleberry syrup smelled like cough syrup when I first opened it (ugh), it has a nice flavor when mixed with water. It's kind of light, fruity and somewhat similar to blueberry.For myself, I would give it 5 stars, but my 9 year old daughter (who's been sampling syrups with me) didn't like it at all. So I think maybe this flavor is more subjective than some of the others. If you're not sure about it, I'd say try it once at a local coffee shop before you buy a whole bottle."
1,WHO CUT THE CHEESE!!!!,"This movie is terrible trash.Mariah Careyis the worst actress since Lindsay Lohan.This movie is so bad it might supplant""Manos,The Hands of Fate"" as the worst movieof all time."
1,All That Glitters Isn't Gold,"While I enjoy Mariah Carey's music, this move is a trainwreck, only not the kind you can't turn away from. This is easy to walk away from. The movie is uninspired, as is the acting. It boggles the mind what makes pop divas think that because they can sing well, that they can also act. This has only proven true with a few artists, and the others are simply not acting material. Mariah would fall into that category. Her acting lacks emotion and drive, it seems like she is shifting from scene to scene just being there, like scenery. The supporting cast is better, but not much either. The script is a mess too, after a few scenes in the beginning when we see Carey's character being taken away, we're supposed to feel compassion but it doesn't happen. Basically the movie is just to show off Mariah's vocal skills which we already knew she had. Plain and simple. Overall, the acting is horrible, and the movie is boring, stay away from GLITTER."
3,"Buy this DVD, only if you are a Die Hard Mariah fan",I am a die hard Mariah Carey fan so that was the only reason I enjoyed this film somewhat. I believe that Mariah did a good job acting considering this was her first major role. I don't think that people should be so hard on her. I think the problem with this movie was that whoever made the script for this movie should be fired. Mariah did the best she could with this script. Also the story is somewhat entertaining but gets redundant at times. Buy this DVD (as I will) only if you are a big Mariah Carey fan.Mariah Carey gets: 4 out of 5 starsScript gets: 1 out of 5 stars.Glitter overall: 3 out of 5 stars
1,Glitter,i wasnt pleased with this item at all. the dvd doesnt even work so i would like to get my money back if possible.
4,Glitter definitely shines,"I drove 2 1/2 hours to see this in West Nyack cause it wasn't playing in Albany, NY. Hearing all the bad reviews, I really thought it was gonna be horrible. Besides the plot going by too fast, I thought it was a really good movie that showcased Mariah's talent. It needed to focus more on real '80's themes, but other than that, I really liked it. I think the Glitter album was one of her best despite what people say. :)"
5,MARIAH CAREY GLITTERS AND IS THE NEXT CHER,I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THEIR MUSIC BUT I CAN'T DENY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE COOL AND HOT.ANYWAYS BACK TO THE SUBJECT GLITTER IS A REALLY SWEET RAGS TO RICHES STORY ABOUT FAME LOVE AND MUSIC .EVEN THOUGH GLITTER DIDN'T DO WELL IN THE MOVIES I ADVISE MARIAH TO KEEP ACTING AND SHE'LL GET THERE JUST LIKE CHER DID.CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER IN WISEGRLS
4,Not That Bad!,"Glitter is not that bad of a movie and belive it or not Mariah Carey does just fine. She may not be a great actress but she is charming and likeable. Maybe she should have started with smaller roles and worked her way up, but overall she gives a convincing portrayal of Billie Frank, aspiring pop diva. The plot is the basic rags to riches story. It does move a little slow and in almost every scene someone comments on incredible her singing voice is or how beautiful she is, which gets a tad annoying, but the music is appealing, and it looks like Mariah is having a ball. This is definetly a camp classic, sort of like Showgirls. It's so bad sometimes you gotta love it just for the cheese factor. I think most people will probably hate it, but Mariah fans and fans of campy movies will fall in love with it and watch it over and over again."
4,Mariah Glitters,"I watched Glitter this weekend. Upon entering the theater there was a part of me that was afraid of what I would see - a horrible film, bad acting, and the demise of Mariah's acting career. As I looked around I noticed there were only a handfull of people in the theater so I immediately knew that this movie was not going to be the commercial success that a lot of people were hoping for (it's only at number 11 this week). I liked the movie a lot. The movie has no socially redeeming value, but that's not the point of it. It's meant to be pure entertainment and Mariah definitely delivers. It's a fun movie with a great storyline. There were a few scenes that were emotional and touching and Mariah's music scores the movie well. Her acting skills, though not bad, do need a little work, but this is her first movie so give her a break. She is definitely a capable actress and I'm now eagerly anticipating her next movie: Wisegirls."
4,I Enjoyed it,This film isn't the worst film in the world and it isn't the best. Mariah reached a point in her career where she wanted to try something new and this film was something new for her. Her acting skills arn't as good as good as Julia Roberts or who ever but Mariah can work on it and get better. The Story is simple but Mariah takes a cheeky stab at the way record companys control artists. There is more to the story then just rags to riches and when it comes down to it I'm sure Mariah was having fun and the film is fun and its hard for critics to understand that because everything they seem to write is negative. Anyway I enjoyed it and I am glad to support Mariah in her acting because if thats what she wants to do then good on her... Enjoy it
3,Good Effort MC!,"Well, as a Mariah fan, I can't hate this movie. And I do have to agree that it pretty much sucked. But Mariah will always be what the records say...The Greatest Selling Female Artist of All time!"
3,A good movie,"the movie isn't as bad as the critcs said. it has a great love story,a good plot and the songs are great. what else do u want in a movie?? this movie isn't great or academy award worthy but its nice and funny. if you're too cheap to go for a screening go buy the dvd or don't get off your lazy butt and buy it from the web."
1,Terrible HD,"This movie is not in HD....it may be in the HD format ie Blu-ray, but this movie is not any where near HD quality."
5,One of the best war movies i've ever seen!,Usually when you watch an alien war movie you think why am I here wathing this dumb movie. Well I thought Preditor put this stereotype in the dirt.
5,GREAT,I bought this movie without even seeing it.But i wated it today and i like it .I bought it on dvd .I;'m going to go see alien vs predator tonight.I houp it is good.
4,All The Bad Reviews Scared Me Until...,"I watched it for myself. I can honestly say I thought it looked terrific. I own a Samsung 40"" HDTV and a Samsung Blu-ray player.It is obvious there was some serious DNR done to this but it wasn't enough to distract me.In simplest terms it looks like it was shot with digital cameras instead of film."
3,The camouflaging creature is after Arnold.,"It's Arnold Schwarzenegger with his cigar! He teams up with Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke, Richard Chavez, Jesse Ventura and Shane Black. They also find Elpidia Carrillo. They go to a mexican jungle to find and rescue hostages, but instead they find themselves trying to save their own lives from a nearly-invisible creature able to camouflage itself in the jungle. It loves to skin humans to death.Arnold even does the ""Conan"" primal yell!No extras on this DVD except theatrical trailer.Sequels:Predator 2(1990)AVP - Alien Vs. Predator (Widescreen Edition)(2004).Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem (Unrated Edition)(2007).Predators(2010)."
2,Keep your dvd and sve yourself some change.,"First of all its not even widescreen and the sound is terrible as well as picture quality for blue ray.It looks washed out and the sound muffled.you will find a similar complaint to the first terminator..Are they trying to lessen the old school action hero movies now?All I know is I stopped this and popped in the dvd and enjoyed it more.that bothers me because I blindly went out and began upgrading my collection.Its hit or miss with blue ray.My guess is later they will come out with another edition for you to buy thats enhanced with ""features"".also no special features on on this .My surround sound and big screen tv plays the dvd version with flying colors compared to this ?Hell I'd rather watch the vhs cbs fox video release of this its so insulting."
1,Weak,"I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one. Alien and Aliens are so much better. I liked the score and cinematography and there is occasionally some decent gore thrown in here and there. Otherwise this is a pretty lame movie. See Die Hard 1&3, Hunt For Red October or Last Action Hero for a good John Mctiernan film."
4,"THE BEST SCIFI/HORROR THRILLER SINCE ""ALIEN""!!!!!!!!!!!","Arnold Scharzzeneggar is the lead of a troup of military commandoes in this classic scifi classic!!! When in Central America, the troops are mysteriously hunted down by an unseen enemy!!! When they are wiped out one by one, it is up to Arnold to destroy the invisible creature!!! I love this movie!!!! BUY IT!!! Also check out Predator 2!!!!!"
5,Predator is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great movie, if you liked the Alien movies or Predator2 you will love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of my favorite movies of all time!,I love the fact that older movies that I love are getting released on Blu Ray. This movie looks amazing and sounds awesome. I've seen it around 50 times and I'm sure to see it 50 more!
3,Ok for the price.,I just bought this BR from Walmart in a discount bin for $8. I also own the DVD so for this price you can't go wrong. I read all the reviews for the BR but I still love the movie. The extras are great to watch.
1,"Proper Blu-Ray upgrade, please ?","The movie itself is great. Won't bother you with all the details, because you're well aware of them, of course. I'm waiting for a proper blu-ray edition, one that takes advantage of the format. This one doesn't. The studio's blu-ray version insults my intelligence. 'Nuff said."
3,Reviews of this item pre 6/29/10 are irrelevant,"All the one star reviews are referring to the already released predator Blu-ray. It is agreed among the HD community that the other predator first edition was of poor quality in sound and picture. This release will probably have all the extras, hd surround sound, as well as lets cross our fingers a remastered print. So don't listen to any of the reviews prior to this being released. Once it ships check out Blu-ray movie websites to get a real review."
4,Pretty entertaining,"I used to watch this movie all the time about 10 yrs ago when it came out on TV. Back then I thought it was the best movie ever made, but numerous viewings of it has forced me to pull a star. All in all though, it's a great movie and well worth seeing. I guess I just burned myself out on it."
5,Very good movie!,"As we are all aware of the fact that this isn't a brand new film by any means, but I will say it looks great on bluray in all respects except for the fact it lacks any extras which some people aren't too happy about! The only scene that I found to be blurry/below par was when Arnold starts slipping off the cliff and starts falling into the river. From the time he starts his fall the picture becomes VHS quality for a few seconds but as soon as he hits the water, we are back on track again! That is my only real criticizm of this disc, otherwise it is highly recommended compared to the dvd quality. The sound ofcourse rocks as well! You be the judge, I highly recommend the upgrade, otherwise!"
4,I like the sequel more but this one is still good.,"Let me first say when I hear about Arnold Schwarzenagger being in a film I absolutely cringe when I hear it because to tell you the truth....I think he sucks. Anyways I like this movie because it contains a really good looking and scary villain and the only actor to take him on is Arnold which I did not mind this time. He does not talk much in this film (which is a good thing) as he tries to create a good strategy in destroying the man-hunting beast. I like how the creature can only see in infrared making it very hard for any human being to hide from the big bug looking creature. I like this film because it deals with the same matter as in 'Alien', in which you the viewer watch a man who has weaknesses try to defeat a 'Perfect Killing Machine' and tries to escape it's powerful fate of death."
3,wheres the love?,"If this review were based on the movie alone, i'd give it 5 stars. The beef i have is with the transfer to the DVD format. The video looks terrible. Its grainy and the color is off. What a letdown. It sounds good but couldn't they have put some more effort into the picture? No bonus materials of mention either. This DVD definatly doesn't take full advantage of the medium. Its a shame cause the movie itself is spectacular."
4,MUCH IMPROVED BLU-RAY of 80's CLASSIC,"Finally 'Predator' gets the Blu-ray treatment it deserves. The new Ultimate Hunter Edition is a massive improvement in picture quality and extras.Tension abounds as Arnie and his crew of crack mercenaries (including Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura,Bill Duke & Sonny Landham-all excellent)thrash through the South American Jungle on a covert mission unawares they're being stalked by a deadly alien hunter. The Californian Gov's in fine form, fragging bad guys and sending them off with his trademark one liners.One of the Arnold's brawny best puts most modern action films to shame for sheer high testosterone impact, executed with muscular style and vigour by Director John McTiernan."
4,No Film Grain.,"Still Predator, but in some scenes (especially when Dutch and Dillon first reunite), the film grain has been digitally removed and the actors look waxy. It can be pretty distracting."
5,Goooooooo Predator!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is an awesome movie I liked this movie so much it's just such a good movie and I especially liked the part where the one guy looks strait at the Predator sees the wigly sight of a cloak then before he knew what hit him ppssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh his whole facial area is gone Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha mess with a Predator you get a hole blown strait through the middle of your head.As you could probably geuss I was rooting for the Predator I even rooted for him against The Governator and the Aliens. well that's all I have to say about this movie
5,Great Movie,"This movie is way cool AND the special features included in this set are actually worth watching. The ""making of's"" are pretty interesting."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever Made!,"Almost everyone has seen or herd of the movie Predator, and if you haven't then you must be living under a rock. This movie is assume, I watch like every time it is ever on TV! A must have for any Arnold Schwarzenegger fan! Get this two disc collectors edition!"
5,"Predator, probobly the coolest movie ever[in my opinion]","This is my reiview the the classic movie by Arnlod Schwarzeneggerabout a squad of Army Rangers who go and try to get as many American Army hostages from a group of Guerillas. Then, the Native American in the Ranger squad finds the Green Berets the squad was looking for were skinned alive. Not until after some intruge and a firefight did they finally find out about the Predator.The first guy who got it was Poncho, the raidio man. The rest of the movie and the cool end I will not tell beacause it will spoil the suspence. The ovie is rated R for strong language, strong violence and themetic elements"
5,The art of listening with an open eye,"It is not simply, music, but where the music leads you. Now I don't doubt you could sit down with 500 cds and find something that would be the equivalent. The important point, is that if you find it works for you, (opens your inner eye and leads you to the place you need to be in order to be more effective in your tarot readings) then isn't it worth it?The best I can say, is when I played this for the first time, it was when I was stressed out...it overcame that and moved me to a better place. Almost like never having heard your mother's voice since birth and then hearing it for the first time in years. You recognize it, it calls to you and you respond with an openess.I teamed it up with a scented eye pillow for relaxation while resting. Then I tried reading several spreads, I was amazed that I was able to go a lot further with the imagery than I have done in the past.Worth every cent!"
5,Awesome humane trap,This trap is so simple my 3 year old can set it. We are baiting for squirrels that are creating damage to our house. Unfortunately we ended up catching an opossum. Catch and release is very easy with no damage to the animal.
4,Squirrel Trapping,"Havahart 1040 Two Door Cage Trap for Small Raccoons 30 x 7 x 7Trapped 2 Squirrels in 2 days. Good trap, but you have to get to know it."
4,under armour cold gear boot socks,"I got these for my husband , he works in the cold all day. He says they are very comfortable but about the same as other work socks when it comes teo keeping your feet warm. No complaints and they didnt cost that much more than a normal,good, pair of wook socks. Fast delivery and great customer service with the company....will do business with them again."
1,Not sure what to get your 13 year old for xmas?,"""Personal Journals"" by Sage Francis would make a great stocking stuffer. The moment the first song ""Crack Pipes"" starts you will feel swept up into Sage's world of middle class torment. As Sage's words flow like honey from your speakers, you will think ""Hey, that kid down the street with baggy pants would sound better over these beats than this guy!"". As Sage takes you through tough issues such as relationships with handicapped people (climb trees), selling dime bags (eviction notice), and alzheimer's stricken parents (cup of tea), youll squirm all the way and wonder who the #1 stunna really is. An excellent companion to ""The Marshall Mathers Show"" for anyone who likes deep caucasian ""rapping""."
2,topaznights,"When I first saw this product I was so excited for it to arrive. What I hadn't expected was something so small. When told it would have 32 different patterns in the kit it misleads you a little. You only get 7 or 8 sheets front and back with mostly basic fundimental designs on them that repeat only in a slightly different manner. It also doesn't give ANY instrustiion on how to do any of the ""lessons"" shown. you need to look at the picture and figure it out for yourself. If you are just starting out and don't know what you're doing this would be good for you. Otherwise you know everything that is shown here. Better yet save your money and take a decorating course."
2,Only an average thriller.,"While entertaining, this book is very predictible. There aren't any surprises, so you are left with Coontz's description of events to entertain you. He does a good job describing the action and the CIA inflitration of CUBA. Grafton is a minor player in this book, his only job being to monitor an attack that he is in charge of. Still, this book is easy to read and not a total disappointment."
3,Loved the first three quarters!,"This book had me absolutely captivated as it portrayed life in Cuba...as it developed characters of a family and others around them that live in today's Cuba...as it protrayed how real Cubans feel about their leadership and how, with little of tangeable wealth, there is happiness. About 75% in to the Book it took a completely different turn and became a handbook of military jargon and seemed to want to merely show the expertise of the author in modern military proceedures. The book moved from a real story with depth of characters to wartime garbage. If you want a Book on the military and the strength of today's military read the last quarter - if you want a good book on today's Cuba and the feeling of Cuban people, read the first three quarters. Unfortunately mixing both merely makes you feel cheated."
3,Cuba - the paradise & the peril!,"Snatched from today's headlines, a boat full of refugees sets out for Florida as a dictator lies dying & his ministers plot for power. Old USSR missiles with chemical warheads come online even as the US Navy ships out-dated weapons from Guantanemo Bay. The Prologue is a fascinating glimpse of the history of USSR/Cuban relationships over the past 40 years as seen through the eyes of an aged Russian missile tender. Then Rear Admiral Jake Grafton & his side-kick, Commander Toad Tarkington are on the high seas again off the coast of the paradise of Cuba. A super modern naval/political yarn with surprises at every corner & a rollicking good pace. Well worth the read - tight story with some memorable characters - especially the modernday Don Quixote in his MiG-29. END"
3,does what it should... sort of,"I have not had to push the limits of time of this backup, but it seems fine. I tested it for a few minutes... I have tried and not been successful in getting the computer to ""see"" it so it can auto shut down the computer if I am not present during a power outage. Not sure what the problem is and don't have the time or interest in trying to pursue it via tech support. It hooks up via serial cable. I would think a modern appliance would use USB and be more reliable. I am running Win XP Pro.I do like it though because of the size (time it's supposed to run on battery power) for the relatively low price."
5,Saved me from permanent soft poop!,"I've been using this product for four years. My five year old lab has had terrible digestion problems, so I tried Geneflora. After a few weeks he became more regular. Now. Use it for both dogs everyday."
1,A Waste of Money,"This wallet is almost useless - should be renamed a card holder which realistically can only hold approximately 6 cards. Much too costly! It should be noted that this item cannot hold any money, unless folded very small, which ofcourse makes it bulky and unable to close! I wasted $30.00!"
4,Excellent!,"Product was shipped in a timely manner, received on time and product was in perrfect condition! Very happy with the product i purchased"
3,Faucet Great - Soap Dispenser cheezy,"I received the Delta faucet and I thought it was great. The Faucet itself is Wonderful! But the soap dispenser is plastic and it didn't seal correctly to our counter tops, and it just looked Cheezy. We ended up getting another soap dispenser that was similar but wasn't exact. would have been happier with a matching set, but oh well.Just a warning - I would definetly buy the faucet again, but NOT THE SOAP DISPENSER."
2,FAME MIGHT NEVER MAKE IT TO BROADWAY,"I dont know if they are planning to take this show to Broadway, If they are planning to, I certainly DO NOT suggest it! The show begins with the song Pray I Make P.A which has such upsurd lyrics as ""Next Week I going to be gone/ Where's the John?"" This is just one example. The worst 2 songs of the show are ""Tyrone's Rap"" and ""Cant Keep it Down"". One of the better numbers is between two teachers and is called ""The Teachers Argument"". The Best number in the show is ""I Wanna Make Magic"" about a boys dream to be a star in theater. I think the lowest part of the show is when they actually mention the movie Fame! Even some flops have better songs then this! This show has some likeable moments but I recommened buying something else first!"
2,Very funny but lacking in propriety,"Shelton is hilarious. Working Mother magazine says she is ""the true successor to Erma Bombeck's throne."" Sorry, I cannot agree; Erma never cussed. I don't mind a little garden-variety cussing here and there, but Shelton really lets loose at times and pulls out the big ones--the offensive ones, that is. She did not end up using the F word, but frankly I don't know what stopped her; everything else was there. She really doesn't need the shock factor to be funny either. She's a riot. She's definitely been in the trenches, but she could take a lesson from Erma the Great. My rating for Shelton would have been a five if she had just cleaned up her act."
4,L-358 worth the price. I used it at every shoot,Although on the basic end regarding light meter. This little wonder does the job. What I like best it that it fits in my pocket with ease. I used it on every photo shoot. If you are planing to get this light meter remember to also by the wireless transmitter. The wireless transmitter allow great metering for flash when used with pocket wizard.
5,Perfect for it's use,"I'm using for a month in studio and outdoor and it's a great product. Consistent readings, well built, easy to use although has many advanced features... Indispensable tool for studio and hard lightning conditions."
2,Lackluster collection of short stories,"While John Steinbeck is a master of Literature, The Long Valley's stories are all dull and some don't even feel like stories, but just descriptions of things (the short story ""Breakfast"" was overly pointless). This collection starts off great, with a couple of wonderful stories, but the second half of the book (along with The Red Pony parts (another of John Steinbeck's drab writings)) is very bad and yawn-inducing.My favorite story was ""The Flight"", and that is the only reason I am rating this 2 stars instead of 1. ""Johnny Bear"" is also a good story in this collection, and a fairly humorous one as well.Check this out at the library for a couple of good stories, but do not purchase it as it would be a waste of money. If you want to read great works by Steinbeck, check out East Of Eden, The Grapes Of Wrath, and Of Mice And Men."
5,Seems to do what it is supposed to,"Thank heaven I haven't HAD to use this yet, but seems from testing to do what it's supposed to."
5,ResQMe,Compact fits easily in most pockets. Also nice design and shape the detachable keychain cover on the seatbelt cover works well.
3,"Feels small, cheap and unreliable in my hand.","I don't know if this works as marketed or not, and I hope I never have to find out, but it feels small, cheap and hard to handle in an emergency. Maybe my fingers are just too big. I might go ahead and invest in a larger item that makes me feel safer, but I'll keep this on my key chain as a backup, just in case."
3,Broke after about 5 months,They replaced it for free so that was nice. The spring-loaded head does not push back. I used a flashlight and looked inside and noticed that the pin is not centered with the hole in the middle of the hammer head which is the cause to why the spring-loaded head does not push back. I'm very angry about receiving a defective product.
1,A Piece of Junk,I returned this emergency keychain to Amazon because it didn't work.The spike wouldn't even dent a glass bottle. The razor blade that's supposed to cut seat belts in an emergency took too much time.
5,Love the movie,Great Family movie.This movie is a feel good movie that everyone will love no matter what age you are.
3,If you are beginner,"Very old book. If you are beginner, but can get this book without paying for it, get it and read it. All components of Microsoft Office for win95 are covered very good. Book describes in detail everything reader need for starting with MS Office such as starting any of comonents, using and sharing information within different component. If you are, at least, intermediate user of MS tools, you know enough to skip this book."
5,The Chill of a Good Ghost Story!!,"I was vacationing last week at the Oregon Coast and I came upon a used Bookstore. I was looking through the horror section of the store and noticed this book. The title at the top ""The most Haunting Novel of the Year!"" caught my attention. It's creepy and once you start reading it, you cannot stop! I finished it in less than a day and a half! The story moves swiftly and scarily to its ineveitable climax, until you are left drained, but ultimately satisfied, by this haunting tale!"
3,"Overpriced, limited positioning","Based on my satisfaction with Ergotron's monitor mounts I purchased this mount for my home/office keyboard tray. High quality/solid construction, but I'm disappointed with the limited number of positions the articulating arm will ""lock"" into. At this price point I expected a toothless tiller design that would offer unlimited positioning/flexibility. Sadly this model doesn't have it and the arm is 1-2 inches shorter than I would like."
2,not good,"I have been reviewing all different types of baby carriers and love my Maya wrap. I carry my 22 pound one year old on my hip in it and was looking for something more substantial to support him on my hip- after reading reviews I purchased this and when it arrived it was just what I was looking for! I put it on and it looked great and the straps are SOOO long!!! I am 5'10 and a size 18w- so I was expecting this to be small, but it was not at all! Then before we left the house for the day I decided to give it a test run with my baby in it before we left and I am so glad I did! As soon as I placed him in it- I hated it! It made him sit so low that it was very uncomfortable. Then I tried to put the straps around my waist line instead of my hips and the straps had to be so tight around to keep him up that it was very uncomfortable! The shoulder strap was also very little. Would be good for someone who has a little shoulder and a VERY tall toddler. still on the hunt for that perfect carrier....."
3,Good read,Decent book; different vampire method of obtaining blood;saw the movie afterwards on accident; made me appreciate the book!
1,"Very, very sick and degrading book","This book is a true sickie. We're not talking about vampire existentialism a la Anne Rice; we're talking about hardcore nasty, short, and brutish nihilism of a depth unlike anything I've ever seen. Read at your own peril."
5,how could it get any better,it is perfect the taste the bottle but the only draw back is that its expencive but there perfect for a party or any time like many people say it tastes kinda like sprite but in a way better way and also try white rabbits there way good also dont these online just get them at your local asian marketplace !!
4,Vacuum cleaner replacement bags reasonably priced.,"Thank you Amazon for stocking these Sharp vacuum cleaner replacement bags! I found them better priced on this site than elsewhere - certainly better priced than the store where I purchased the Sharp vacuum cleaner. The change in packaging threw me, but when I remembered how many years had passed since I bought the vacuum cleaner, I realized that as long as the bags worked with the cleaner, it's all good. And they do!!"
3,Decent flash,Did not get this through amazon. I got it on clearance for a canon mount. It works well and was inexpensive so I can't quibble about it too much. My only real annoyance is that the head doesn't rotate. That wassn't a deal breaker. I tend to use a flash very infrequently anyway. It does help when you need it...and the addition of the diffuser makes this a decent flash for the money. NOTE...I am strictly amateur.
5,Insightful manual for fitness success!,"Finally a fitness book that supplies ALL the tools you need to succeed in getting fit. Exercises with pictorial descriptions makes it easy for the novice weight trainer to get started with the program. I enjoyed the inspirational real stories of people finally ""doing it"" whether it be in diet/nutrition, emotional recovery, or strength training. I found the charts to be crucial in my own success, especially the action/result goals and resistance training program. This is a must have fitness book!"
3,Good writing and plot but flat characters,"Well written with a decent plot overall (a few good, unexpected turns), though it did drag a little at times. Characters were a little flat and not always realistic - for example, I thought the little sister behaved like she was more around 8 - 10 years old, not 13! I get that the reader was seeing her through the family's eyes, who still saw her as a child and coddled her because of her illness but even with that in mind I felt her behavior was too childish or childlike for her age."
1,Back to the Drawing Board,"In all of my 50 years I've never read a book that was so riddled with mistakes. Even an old guy like me can see that the author doesn't know HTML as the examples he gives don't work.The title claims the book is about collecting online but the only subject covered in any detail are a few auction sites. The book has more fluff than anything else and no real examples of how to create an interesting auction on eBay or any other site. Of the 112 pages in the book, 63 of them are filled with pictures, most of which have no relevance to the book."
5,Very helpful,This book helped me get my part-time online business up and running. It is concise and informative. The HTML examples worked fine for me.
2,easily the most overrated book of the fantasy genre,"Blah. Overrated, overdone, overkilled, and there are many better authors out there that write better stories."
3,Run out of Wheel of Time or Tolkien books?,"Perhaps you just finished the last book (so far) from the Wheel of Time or Lord of the Rings...And now you're thinking about trying out a new series.Give it a try. It's definately worth it. It takes awhile to adjust to a new series and author, so give the book a chance. Goodkind takes his own unique approach to developing the atory and characters. I did too much comparing against other series when I started the Wizard's First Rule, but now after the first two books, I am very glad I did. Looking back, the first book in the series is quite good, and the second gets better."
4,very good writing and structure; a good story,"This book reads fast due to Mr. Goodkind's excellent writing skills. (If his writing career had fizzled he could have been an English teacher.) The story is good but at times it relies too much on coincidences to drive the storyline (main action points fall into place a little too easily). This is a fantasy story with wizards and dragons; but it is also an adult read with a long section on torture and sexual dominance (although not graphic).If you like your fantasy/sword novels long and with many sequels; then this is for you.If you are thinking about trying one of these stories for the first time; based on the author's skill as a writer i say ""give it a try; at the very least the structure and writing will keep you from pulling your hair out if, in the end, this style of storytelling is not your thing.As for me, i have already ordered the next book in this story."
5,Simply amazing fantasy novel!,"If you love epic fantasy series, this on is for you! The plots through the first 4 books are captavating! Unlike some other fantasy novels, this one doesn't gloss over the horrors of life. This series is full of torture, murder, and unfortunately even rape.I have read the first 7 books of Robert Jordan's Wheel of time (and not looking forward to the eighth.) Unlike Jordon's story, at the end of every one of Goodkind's books there is just _barely_ enough of a loose thread for the next book. Each book has a completely satisfying conclusion!The books have all of the depth of Jordan's WoT with a slightly better story. It's a little unnearving at first to notice about 600 parallels between the WoT series and Goodkind's Sword of Truth. But Goodkind does such a better job that you don't notice after a while.This book and the entire series all deserve 5 stars!"
5,Wow.,"I was scaning through the Fantasy section one day and picked up this book. I read the first hundred pages, got up with a smile on my face, and walked to the register. I set the book down and the man at the counter began telling me how great this book was. So I gave him the 10 bucks and went home geting ready to read a great book. I picked up where I left off, and didn't stop until I finished the book.This book took me through an earthquake of emotions as I slowly read the book. I couldn't take my eyes off the pages and I inched my way through. This book griped me, I simply couldn't stop reading this book. The next day, I went back to the store and bought the rest of the series. I have grown to love this series and I would give it to a friend to read without a second thought. Read this book, and I bet you'll like it, without a doubt."
5,"a masterpiece, no more no less.","No fantasy novel since J.R.R Tolkiens Lord of the rings, has given me more inspiration than Wizard's first rule. Terry Goodkinds pen is full all the aspects I expect from an epic fantasy novel, its truly a masterpiece, no more no less."
1,I liked this book...,"...at first. It is one of the better fantasy stories of the decade, but nowhere near Robert Jordon. That started me thinking about Jordon. About how much thiss book was like Jordon's. About how he copied characters whole from several WoT books. About how mad I was And then I saw Star Wars for the first time. I was probably one of three people in America who hadn't seen all three Star Wars movies, just numbers 2 and 3. It was amazing. He copied everything!!! Old grandfather/wizard? Evil wizard/father? Beautiful princess in trouble? Sword that glows and cuts through anything? It's all there!!! Personnally I think Robert Jordan, George Lucas, and just for good measure Terry Pratchett, should all go to his house and beat him to death with sacks of doorknobs, but maybe that's just me."
1,Evidently I did something in a past life to deserve this,"I was foolish enough to buy the first 8 books in this series before reading the first one. Then I read it, and I kept expecting there to be some twist, something clever, something interesting. Reading it for the first time feels like you're reading it for the 10th time, because you will know EXACTLY what is going to happen next (with the exception perhaps for gratuitously sadistic stuff...which a normal sane person likely would not be inclined to predict). Terry does for Fantasy writing what the Titanic did for passenger liners. The fact that so many people rate this book at anything other than 1 star make me tear my hair out in despair because the Mayans ended up being wrong. This book's high rating is a harbinger of the end of civilization."
2,Amazingly awful dialog,"Truly awful dialog and unbelievable character interaction. I've never met people who interact like this. I've seen amateur movies with dialog this awkward, but I've never read a novel with reviews this enthusiastic that turned out to have such amateurish writing. Seriously, the Captain Underpants books are better written than this thing is."
1,"If I Could Give This Book Minus Five Stars, I Would","I ""sampled"" the first few pages of this book and it seemed to be a fairly enjoyable, though derivative, quest fantasy. I bought it without reading the reviews, and that's a mistake I will never make again. This fantasy turned darker and more brutal with each chapter and by the middle was into child torture and pedophilia - at which point I quit and removed this creepy mess from my Kindle."
2,robuster,"Over the last year I've gone thu most of the really good novels of this genre.A lot of my fantasy friends sold me on this book.Disappointing.The book was wrote for teenagers,or kids just about to be teens.It was a rehash of The Wheel Of Time.A bad one at that.Save your money, move on to something with more realistic relationships.The flow of the story was awful,hard to keep up with and then for pages nothing would happen."
3,Did anyone proof read this?,"This is a fun, easy to read story. Nothing earth shattering, but entertaining. What was shocking to me, was how many errors there were in the text. Not only were there too many typos to count, but also places where the wrong word was written. I might expect this from some of the new books being cranked out for e-readers, but really, Terry Goodkind is a huge author. I am pretty sure the print editions did not contain all these errors! I would have continued the series if not for this. Just so you know, I am not talking about few errors sprinkled though the book, there were chapters that had at least one mistake per page-very distracting."
2,"Good attempt, but violence detracts from world...","This was my first Terry Goodkind novel, and, although I found his world amusing, his style crisp, and characters sufficiently engaging, the violence that literally erupted from nowhere in several sections of the book turned me off from reading any more of his work. Mr. Goodkind lulls you with pastoral scenes and then throws attempted rape, torture, and child molestation into the mix to shock the reader. If you do not enjoy graphic violence, do not pick this book up."
4,Good- but kinda a play-off,"This book was an excellent book, and held my attention for a long time. It and it's sequels are wonderful. However, I thought it sort of a play off of Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series. I noticed many similarities and other things in it and the others. I enjoyed it immensely, and hope others did as well. I would definately recommend this book if you are an avid fantasy reader, who reads a lot or quickly."
4,Well worth the read!!,"A compelling storyline..Addictive at times to the point of not being able to put the book down because you'll want to continue to read further to see what happens next. Well developed characters. Wish Zedd had more play in the book. Goodkind spent to much time on the Denna(Mord-Sith) and Richard's inter-action. Michael's role should have been a bit more developed. Other than those few minute setbacks, this book was fantastic and very entertaining. I highly reccommend fantasy readers indulge in this book. You definitely wont be disappointed. I give it two thumbs up!!"
4,Good Start to the Series,"A different take on magic than other fantasy novels out there highlights this book for me with additive and subtractive magic. The main characters of Richard, Zedd and Kahlan are interesting. Goodkind is a good writer and keeps the story moving at a good pace. Overall, a promising start to what has become a Jordan-esque like fantasy series in size."
5,first rule rules!,"I'm not much of a fantasy reader (although I have read Robert Jordan and the Harry Potters) but I liked this one. This was the first fantasy book I had read and it kept my interest all the way through. I didn't want to put it down. The characters and plot were likeable enough that I read much of the rest of the series. My then 11 year old son loved the books so much that he wrote to Mr. Goodkind letting him know that he'd read them, and even gave a 'plot' suggestion. ;) (Mr. Goodkind was kind enough to write back to him.) My family and I agree that the first rule is absolutely true - you'll have to read the book to find out what that is!"
2,"Same thing, different book title","I found this book to be very predictable. It seemed to have borrowed almost directly from other fantasy books. Samual was a Smeagol clone etc. I did finish it, which says something for it. There was one twist I didn't see coming. The reader of this book on tape sometimes seemed to have come from the Captain Kirk school of acting. All in all, not great."
5,Spellbinding,"One of my best reads in a long time. Goodkind is a great story teller, on par with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings."
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat,"When I started reading this book I wondered, ""What else has this guy written?!"" I was amazed to find out that this was his first novel. This action packed book keeps you turning the pages and not wanting it to ever end. The bad news is, it does end. The good news, he wrote a sequel! (or two) If you love fantasy, I cannot recomend this book enough. I have recommended it to a number of friends and they all have loved it too. Buy this one!"
1,Absolutely horrible!,"First off, the writing was so bad I could barely stumble through the prose. The plot was predictable, but worse than that, it was incredibly derivative. I couldn't find a single element in it that had not been used somewhere else, by a better writer, in a better fantasy series than this one. The violence was over-the-top, unnecessary, and gratuitous. The characters were both predictable and one-dimensional. I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this book. Don't read it. PLEASE. For your own sake."
5,"Enchantingly absorbing...... an absolute ""Must Read""","I have never been an avid reader of fantasy novels, yet Goodkind has spellbounded me with his wondorous writing style and magnificent characters. You begin your read with such appreciation for the pace and direction of the story, that putting it down is almost painful. His characters are strong, intelligent yet not above pain and suffering. They are each representative of who we are in so many ways, and who we fantasize to be in our minds. The story itself never stops moving, not for a second. I loved that best of all! Terry does not write this book as a screenplay for Hollywood (as so many authors I find do today) he writes this as a true storyteller. I cannot say enough positive things about this book. Treat yourself by engulfing your mind into a fantastic story of love, hate, strength, weakness, and best of all magic!"
3,"Started slow, got better","Sort of well-written - I found the characters quite flat and the story pretty lame in the beginning - by the end, I was hooked to figure out how everything got pulled together. Formula fantasy, but put together OK. I'll read the others, but like I read a Tom Clancy novel. It's entertainment."
1,"buffy, my dog, can write better","when you write a conventional fantasy plot which bases itself upon the worn out concept of ""THE ONE"" who is destined to save the world from the dark and evil forces , you better have something else going on for you other than originality.for example: a sweeping love story for the more romantic reader, epic fights for the blood thirsty, humor, belivable and LOVABLE characters and so on .i fear this book has none of it. it's boring and it follows every convention the fantasy genre has to offer.Starting with the mystery woman appearing out of nowhere in desperate need of help, continuing with our hero who rescues her. what a surprise, we'll later find out he is destined to do just that.On their dark and perilous way to save the world from ( again, what a shocker ) an evil magician, they will encounter many idiotic characters, and overcome unmeasurably borring difficulties.To make a long story short, a really Bad book."
1,Don't. Just don't,"I choked my way through the first ten books of this series years ago. Guess what? All the rest of these books are the same. I skimmed the ending of the 12th one day at a bookstore and confirmed what I'd already assumed: this series sucks and gets worse as the bricks were churned out. This is sci-fi written by an Ayn Rand disciple, with all the wooden chacters, stilted dialogue and sexual violence of the Objectivist high priestess Herself. If Ms. Rand is your Bible, then here is your sci-fi. If not, there is a lot of better efforts out there."
5,See for yourself,"Publisher's Weekly sure changed its tune.You will notice that their review for this book states, ""Big, bland and conventional, Goodkind's first novel is an epic fantasy that doesn't conjure up much magic.""Yet, in reviewing the second book in this series, The Sword of Truth, Publisher's Weekly states, ""This satisfying sequel to Goodkind's powerful debut novel, Wizard's First Rule, has everything one could ask for in an epic fantasy.""So now his debut novel is powerful? Not big, bland and conventional?It just goes to show that you ultimately have to read it for yourself to decide.I read it. I don't read fantasy, and I don't read 800 page novels. But this book grabbed me from beginning to end.Read it. Decide for yourself. You'll be glad you did."
1,One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Encountered,"This book was a worthless copy of other writer's fantasy. I put it down about mid-way through when Goodkind began plagiarizing J.R.R. Tolkien. Overall, the writing and plot is worthy of any elementary school child. I am sorry that I even felt the need to devote any more of my time to this worthless piece of trash."
4,Wizard's RULE!,"The first book in Terry Goodkind's amazing Sword of Truth series is the best! A simple woods guide finds himself caught up in an adventure he can't get out of. This is a powerful, moving book that sets up a world of magic and adventure! I recommend this book to anyone who loves magic, plot twists, and romance."
3,I had mixed feelings about this one...,"I am very ambivalent about Terry Goodkind's writing. On one hand, the world that he has created is very well-developed, the plot is interesting, and the characters are very likeable. On the other hand, the writing is just not that great. This is especially evident in the dialogue, which just doesn't read like real people talk. As I was reading this book, I was both enthralled by the plot and at the same time, put off by the flat, unrealistic way the characters spoke. Definitely not among the top ranks of fantasy series - but to Terry Goodkind's credit, I was interested enough to buy the second book so I could find out what happened next!"
1,totally forgettable except for the gratuitous torture,"I picked this book up on the recomendation of a book seller and I was desperate for something new to read.The first time I tried to read it, I didn't get through the first chapter. I should have taken it back and demanded my money back. But I tried it again years later. I can read 2 or 3 books a day, but it took me 2 weeks to slog through this drivel.It's so forgettable that I remember now is that it had a hero... no worthwhile female characters and someone that liked to torture along with sex so that they would become intertwined. Gee thats really uplifting. I have seldom read a book I have despised more."
2,Could have been good....,"This could have been a good book, although comparisons to Tolkien made by some reviewers are just silly. This author isn't anywhere near that league. It started out fun but then the author started to include graphic, lengthy sequences of child abuse and mutilation. I guess this was to show how bad the bad guy was, but just came across as sick, and shows either the limits of the authors skill or his predilictions. So, unless your really comfortable with that sort of thing, I'd look elsewhere."
5,One of the best Fantasy Novels written,"This was the first fantasy novel I read that was more than 200 pages long. I read it when I was 16 years old (now I'm 21) and have read it 4 times since then and countless other fantasy and non-fantasy books. The author, Terry Goodkind, entraps you in the story so well that sometimes you might not even notice or remember that you are even reading a fantasy novel. The character development is so great in this series that by the time you get to the 2nd and 3rd books in the series you can feel what the characters are feeling. And almost anticipate what they will do next, except for an old wizard who will never cease to shock, amaze, and confuse you. This story has swords, dragons, the lost art of magic, love, hate, vast lands, monsters, and most importantly a brilliant author behind it all whose writing abilities put you right next to the characters in the story. I highly recommend this book, and the whole series, you will not be disappointed."
1,What the heck happened?,"Starts out slow, picks up speed nicely...and then slams abruptly into Warp 10. Unfortunately,in a wholly different direction. I've read other reviews commenting on Mr Goodkind's digression into sado-masochism, and I have to say I believe the term ""digression"" to be an understatement. The author throws together chance meetings, a backtrack in the plot, ignores other plot elements entirely, and very implausibly brings the story to a climax...just so he can turn it around and put the hero in peril. The almost excruciating detail of the tortures that follow left me wondering. And then, when these scenes are over, Goodkind almost seems to get bored with the story, bringing it to conclusion.The characters are great, the basic story is ok, but the ""flow"" of the novel is absolutely atrocious. I will not be reading the rest of this series."
1,God is this awful,"This series of books is even worse than Wheel of Time. Jordan is only writing for the money, which all the Lemmings (= Readers) are giving him with a big ""Thank you"". Goodkind is even copying Jordan. And he's copying it very bad. Story? None. Characters? Take a Superman-Comic and you get a much better Characterization. Ideas? Yeah, right... Don't bother with this piece of garbage. Read Williams, Martin, Tolkien etc. if you want good Fantasy. Read R.A. Salvatore if you want good Action-orientated Fantasy. Read He-Man. It has a better story..."
5,The start of a love affair,It took reading this book to understand what the love of a masterful tale is. I have been spellbound and now look with excitement of the adventure that awaits me!!
1,"Oh, please!","If this is the standard of medocrity to which fantasy authors aspire these days, then God help us all. I think the previous review says it all about the type of audience to which this book caters. In the mood for stellar fantasy writing? Read George R.R. Martin. Read Katharine Kerr. Read the Feist/Wurts Empire Trilogy. Read anything but this!"
5,I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN!,"Goodkind, is a brilliant writter. His imagination is great! You can picture all the characters perfectly. The scenes are very visual."
4,"Amazing, Creative, and Gripping","This book was AMAZING! I could not put it down! It is extremely creative and Terry Goodkind creates a world inside your head. For fantasy readers, this is a must. There is nothing wrong with it with the exception of one thing and it's only wrong to those who are not avid fantasy readers; the themes are similar to other stories, though they are well written. Overall, it was a fantastic book, however, I still hold true that Tolkien is better, but this comes 2nd."
5,A good way to spend Free time,"Those who say Goodkind is not original are going into the book with a closed mind. I am the first to say Jordan is good, but his time has passed and I believe that the fantasy torch has been turned over to Goodkind. The book has little descriptive ""fluff"", a great cast, and battle scenes comparitive of David Gemmel. I could see a movie run through my head as I ripped through this series. It starts off 60 pages into it and takes off. The second book (Stone of Tears) is the best fantasy book written to date. My only complaint is I can't wait for a fifth book."
4,"Great story, solid characters, fun to be in the world Goodkind created.","Terry Goodkind creates an entire planet with the Sword of Truth series. This book is the first foray into that world, and does an excellent job of making you fall in love with the characters.Even better than just entertaining you, there are some very solid ""life lessons"" in this book, and the others, in regards to hard work, self reliance, individual freedoms, justice, and power.Overall, a very entertaining book, and likely a great way to impart a few bits of wisdom to some young adults in your home who enjoy fantasy reading and likely won't notice the lessons embedded within."
1,"Awful literature, rambling plot, incoherent world","I guess coming down off a gene wolfe novel didn't help but I was struck by how bad the writing style really is. He makes practically every beginner writing mistake they teach about in 101.The story seemed pretty incoherent. Like maybe he had a couple of ideas and was just making the rest up as he went along.It also has a novellas worth of what amounts to hard s&m; porn in the middle which is a weird diversion. That's all fine and good for it's own thing for the people that dig it, but it doesn't really need to be here."
1,Awful!!!!,"This is quite possibly one of the worst books I've ever attempted to read. I'm not even halfway through and I doubt I'll be able to finish. Unfortunately I make it a policy to finish every book I start. I say unfortunately because this book is painful to read. There may be a story in there somewhere, but I can't get past the juvenile writing and the flat characters.Take my advice, get a different book"
3,"Very ""Lord of the Rings;'ish","In this Lord of the Rings knock off, our hero, a back woods type that has no inkling that he is destined for greatness, awakens one morning to find a strange girl is trying to kill him... after he saves her life. And all he did was give her an apple!So, they begin their saga to defeat the Dark Lord, who, naturally, turns out to be Luke's father, sorry, our hero's father. They travel the lands getting into trouble and eventually steal the Dark Lord's Red Dragon, Scarlet. Scarlet helps the hero progress the story only after her egg is saved. In the interim, pain is conquered and soon, all is right with the world again... or is it? the sequel!"
2,I'm glad I got this one out of the library,"Well - sick as I am (physically), I just can't take anymore. When I was 12, and new to fantasy, I might have enjoyed this book and found the time to finish it. Alas, another scene with a boring character doing one more contrived thing to steer a rather dull plot has driven me to give up. Too bad - Goodkind certainly has a lot of enthusiasm - he needed it to churn out 700 odd pages of repetitive scenes of the hero and heroine meeting one creature after another and (surprise, surprise) surviving relatively unscratched. There were promising elements, but they were lost in the constant pounding of uninteresting action that just wasn't coming to life off the page. If you are looking for the Grisham's equivalent in fantasy - this is it. Dissapointment city."
4,A moderately enjoyable epic fantasy,"Epic fantasy is not usually a genre I care for, but Wizard's First Rule was nonetheless enjoyable. Unlike other epic fantasies, the plot line is clear and relatively easy to follow, avoiding hoards of characters that mysteriously appear after prolonged absences and disappear just as sporadically. The protagonists Richard, Kahlan and Zedd are pleasant enough, despite the fact that they spend most of the book hiding their secrets from each other...Additionally, WFR has a very satisfactory conclusion with just enough loose ends to interest the reader in continuing the Sword of Truth series. Personally, I felt this was the best of the series as of yet.If you liked this, you might also try Wind from a Foreign Sky by Katya Reimann for some more good epic fantasy."
5,A book that should be named a Classic,"Thrilling, fast-paced, and amazing. This book is one of my favorites and SO awesome. I think everyone should read it, it definately deserves a 5-star rating!!"
2,Weak Characters,"I love to live inside characters. But I found them so paper thin in this book, I had a hard time reading it. The overall story is good, but all the encounters by the travelers are the same: They are met with mutual distrust, but are hugging each other within a few pages. I didn't read the series any further, but perhaps Goodkind finds his stride later on."
2,"The more I think about it, the worse it gets","I have read every Terry Goodkind novel, because it was good reading. The more I ponder this series, the more I hate it. It is boring fantasy with nothing original. Half of the series is a Harlequin in a fantasy cover. Then there is all the S&M - complete with leather, toys, and torture until sex prevails at the end. This is not fantasy, but some perverts way to sell a thier ideas. I also got sick of after about 4 books, it seems that Richard and Kahlan never are togeather and when they are it is a stupid, sleezy way - not a way for a heroin and hero. I think what really ruined this series for me is when I tried to compare it to George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones - it doesn't compare."
1,WFR Book1,Even still they want me to write a review of a book that I was never sent. Instead I was sent a later edition. The picture of the book I was to have received was not the same book I got. I was looking for a first edition first printing and was given a later edition.Please make sure you are getting the book you want . Now I did get refunded with no problems but I would have rather spent my time getting the correct book.
5,Couldn't put it down,"Loved this book, its fairly long, which is good it gives you time to get to know the characters. Its the classic good vs. evil story."
5,Simply THE BEST.,"First off, this is the best series I have read thus far, and ""the few"" who did not rate this well lack the imagination to be reading in the first place (interesting how most of them are from Texas...). Terry Goodkind takes the fundamentals of fantasy to the next level and really delivers. If you have not read this book yet, please do, you will be pleased."
4,A new version of an old story,"Good versus Evil. Basic plot line to 99% of fantasy epics. To complain that an author is unoriginal in this genre is like complaining that you got wet when you went swimming. You should expect it. It's how the author creates his world, characters and sequence of events that is going to make a book entertaining or not. Goodkind succeeds on that level. It's an entertaining read. Granted, it's not a literary classic. If you are looking for Shakespeare, you made a wrong turn in the book store. This story isn't going to replace Lord of the Rings. However, it does have the same basic plot. Good versus evil, Dragons, wizards, warriors, witches, beasts and the dead. He even throws romance and torture in there to boot. If you wish to be entertained, then I recommend this book. I gave it a seven on entertainment value. Mr. Goodkind has to make his characters more endearing and remove some of the predictability for me to give higher marks."
5,This was the best book that I have ever read!!,"I don't care what any of you have to say. I don't normally read books, but after I picked up this one and read the first two pages, I never put it down. This story starts off very fast moving and keeps you sweating. You might say this about any book, but The Wizard's First Rule never stops with the intensity. All of the way to the very last page you are sitting on the edge of your seat. I want anyone who doesn't believe me to pick up a copy of this book and read the first chapter. Then tell me if you can put it down"
1,Should be Zero stars: Not all fat books are good.,"I remain puzzled that people find this to be a well-written series. I was so utterly bored by the characters that I couldn't even care when the S&M overtones were introduced.People, fat fantasies are not necessarily good fantasies. Read Kay, Martin, Hobb or Glen Cook for some excellent works. This one just plain stunk out the house."
4,Not Bad,"Not bad book, I will re read it and get the rest of the series, but it had one major flaw.... too much sex! Alright, so in every good book there's a couple of rapists, a few whores, etc... but it seems that Goodkind is a tad obsessed with the man and women intimacies. He even finds a way to make sex a way to torture Richard! It seems to me that Goodkind needed something to fill the pages, so he put sex and rape every 20 pages!... Kahlan gets caught by the quad, who is led by Demmin Nass... a rapist! Richard is captured by Denna... WHo decides to sexually torture him!... Darken Rahl says that if he captures Kahlan, he will rape her so he can have a confessor son!... The examples could go on and on!! Once you get past the sex, it is actually a fantastic book...the plot is excellent, the charactures are well developped, Goodkind has created a world of Fantasy superior to other writers, which is why I gave it 4 stars!"
5,"insight ful, heartpounding,down to earth.","this is the best book (save the bible.)i have ever read. terry has a great understanding or human natue.he didnt just make all this up he took alot of different belives and custom and religons that made the book what it is,a great love story,a story of religon,a story of truth.those of you who dear trash it...well i was told i was to be nice in this review so all i have to say to you fools is to pick up a history book and some books on religion and mayhap you will come to understant these books.oh and one more thing:whats wrong with the truth?the rules are right on.i bet terry could sell a city slicker a herd a sheep with the frist rule.i found out who killed my son useing it.i just cant get into a book that is too far out in lala land.this is a very insightful,realistist well put, life like book.pay no heed to those who dont get it terry, just keep entertaning us."
4,Great fantasy epic,This first book of the series sucks you in and propels you through the pages. Not for the squeamish or the prudish though.
2,men are from mars women are from venus,the story is quite straight forward and it is enjoyable for a while. i called it the hugging book (the female charator just want to sit down to cry over some masculinity's shoulder and then hug everybody!). the female charator is real pathetic. the book offended me and i am not a female. well enough said already. still this will be a best seller!
5,This book was the start of a wonderful series,Personally I enjoyed this book as well as the rest in this series. once I started it I did not want to stop reading until I had read the whole series. I would suggest that any one with an open mind and a large imagination will truly love this book as much as I did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Not ""Perfect"" but close as toasted toads!","Well, I've noticed one thing about the reviews for this series. Either you hated it or you loved it. (Ok, there are a few on the fence as it were... but let's ignore them for now!) I do agree that there were some parts of the book that could have used some more development... but over all I must say it's a page-turner. The characters are quite interesting and the world is fairly developed... enough so that I am thinkin of developin a AD&D Module for it. It would be interesting to play an Additive Wizard or Confessor! (Hmm, of course now ppl will think I'm really strange or something... ah well. see if I care!) Anyways, I'd reccomend this book (and the rest in the series, simply for the story and characters. Very predictable, but totally enjoyable all the same!"
3,A nice read if u don't know what to get,"This book, while entertaining, is not a great fantasy epic that will be talked about for years. The plot moves, and there is plenty of action, but the tale is a collage of works by other authors. (Terry Brooks kept popping into my mind-e.g. Wizard fire-druid fire, Sword of Truth, ect.) This is a good beginner fantasy for adults, and avid readers in a lighthearted mood will enjoy, but if you are looking to jump into a serious series, don't bother."
1,Storytelling Sucks,"Goodkind a better story-teller? Come on! His charactersare from a comic strip...Richard=Dick Tracy! The bookis boring and sappy...if you think falling all over one another and saying ""oh, I love you!"" is character development, then you better read something else--like Stephen Donaldson. Richard is a horny little bog-muffin without any taste...just like most of the teenagers he's supposed to represent. Geesh."
2,"Its ok, could have been great.........","The world is detailed and has lots of original ideas. I liked the little twists, it makes the reading even better.This novel had awkward pacing though. Like, sometimes it can be a page turner, then the next moment, your reading about 80 pages about some dang tribals, no action, no plot development, just 80 pages on tribals, yee hah. One of the more boring scenes is a series of torture sequences that lasted for like 100 pages. I mean, it was really offensive at first, then it just got tedious. Can we just get on with the novel and kill the freakin mistriss.The characters are flat also, but i dont need to go in detail about that, just read the other bad reviews, and then read the good ones and read what they have to say about the characters. Nothing.But when the plot did move along or the action did start going, it was like readin a fantasy classic, untill, of course, we take a 50 page break campin in the woods lecturin about prophecies. ZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!"
2,An Intense Read,"If you plan to read this book, set aside a day...it is a compelling story, page after page. The characters are well developed, making you really care about what happens to them, even with the fast pace. This book kept me up way past bedtime, too many nights, and even when I set it aside I was thinking of what might happen next. I really enjoyed this book, but will not read the sequels until I can devote a day to reading. Mr. Goodkind certainly knows how to tell a tale!"
2,What does this mean?,"I quote from page 10.""12. Theorem. If the two angles C and D are equal, the perpendiculars are equal, and if the angles are unequal, the perpendiculars are unequal, and the larger perpendicular makes the smaller angle.""There is no accomapanying diagram and no proof provided. I choose this particular theorem because it is used in distinguishing Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic geometries, where it is needed for the theorem to hold when comparing a perpendicular to either an acute or an obtuse angle.After reading this gobbledygook, I gave up in despair."
3,Affirmative Biography,"I am surely too old for this book as I assume that it was intended for middle grade school children. This is obvious in that the focus is on the ""re-created"" details of her early life with less emphasis on her role as a savior of her people. Still, it is written smoothly, and it was easy to read."
3,Dali is cool,"If you're a diehard Dali fan than read this book, because it's worth it. However, if your just an average reader looking for a book to read for fun, this isn't it. At first it's interesting to learn about Dali and how he's and weird and where all his ideas come from, but after a while it seems like he's just rambling. I got bored. However, people who are into ""tapping into their subconcious mind"" etc. You people might like this book."
5,"Hard to believe, but its 100% TRUE!!","Having grown up in Delhi, we had heard of the unbelievable story of Shanti Devi Mathur from my father and other relatives who grew up at that time in the same neighborhood in old Delhi.There has never been any doubt about the absolutely truth of the story in minds of anyone growing up in old Delhi at that time. The facts in the book are completely in line with what I have always heard from family. These facts may be hard to accept for many, but do yourself a favor and read the book.....it's 100% true!"
5,One of the best books on reincarnation,"A must read for those who are interested on the topic of reincarnation, What happens after death? Why we are born again? I have read hundreds of books on this topic and this is one of the best. Also read ""Many lives Many Masters"" and the ""Tibetan Book for the dead"""
2,Remember this is book is geared for 9-12 yr olds,"It was my fault I did not pay attention to the reader age group 9-12yrs. I thought this book would have more details in the stories such as in the real Cinderella it mentions that the evil step sister had to cut parts of their feet to fit into the glass slipper, the prince notices the blood and then asked Cinderella the chamber maid to try on the slipper. This is never mentioned in this version. Of course I understand this is geared for children, and I was looking for the adult, true translation, version. The same for the Bluebeard story, looks like I will be returning my copy. Hopefully a younger person can find some use for this book."
3,"""THE QUEEN"" for sure",She is fantastic to listen to and hard to believe the album is more than 80 years old. I guess great holds it's own. A great addition to anyone's collection
4,Famm. Entertainment The Take Over,"The compilation album ""The Take Over"" is a really good CD. I would advise anyone that likes rap music to buy this CD. Shakim, Kayle Killa, Large Amount, Rich Quaters, Flocko and Jon Jon really know how to spit and the beats Shakim and Kayle Killa makes just flow together to well. Truthfully this CD should have recevied a five star rating compared to anyother rapper but compared to the other music and Large Amounts new CD ""All About Business"" this CD is just a step below."
3,Check out free West literature first.,This book has a lot of basic information but most of that is available in the literature that West Systems provides. You can pick up that information free at any West store.
4,most comprehensive book of the lot,"This is a nice book, covering wide areas of gardening.Considering it is under 20 dollars is another plus.Could use more pictures to discribe plants."
3,A Great Start,"The first thing I learned from this book is that Lieberman is lying about never being lied to again. This book was extremely insightful, and a great starting place, but after reading (and re-reading) this book I hardly think that I am a human lie detector. The book was very easy to read, but not organized well. Overall, I would recomend. Had some great tips and considerations that had never occured to me before. This book is far more useful than just aiding in determining if you're being lied to."
5,Bravo Dr. Lieberman.,"For the life of me I do not understand a reviewer's criticism of Never Be Lied to Again. I know people in law enforcement who use the techniques in this book and are very grateful for them. Some of the critics of this system say that it is wrong to use deception to get at the truth. (As Dr. Lieberman suggests is sometimes necessary). Well I live in the real world and if these techniques help to keep a rapist or a child abuser off the streets, then it has done its job. This book is effective and greatly needed. If the methods offend you and you don't care that your spouse is cheating on you or your employees are ripping you off, then don't read the book. But on behalf of us in the real world, thank you Dr. Lieberman."
5,Very good book,"I found this book to be a good one. It gives certain good techniques to find the truth. I felt the book was good, but it can only be so helpful, but this can be helpful in a lot of cercumstances. But ultimately its not going to be easy much of the time to find the whole truth."
2,too vague,This book does not even come close to the caliber of Conquering Deception by Jef Nance. I want a book that gives me hard and fast details not soft and mushy drivel. I am in law enforcement and want information on this subject. I am sending the book back.
3,A painful read with some useful information,"This was a tough book to get through and failed to introduce much information that I didn't already know. The writing style was painful due to the authors choice to alternate the pronouns ""he"" and ""she"". He did this to avoid sounding sexist but pointing it out made it even more irritating. Most of the examples used were nap inspiring: ""You think a student was cheating on her exam."" Or unrealistic: ""You suspect someone of selling you a puppy with a bad heart."" Lieberman knows what he is talking about and the cover of this book looks great but the inside presentation could use a major overhaul. You don't have to read ""Never Be Lied To Again"" to know I am telling the truth."
1,I will give you the TRUTH about this book in 5 mins or less!,"Its easy seeing that there is a 'Lie' in the authors name.... this book was so unbelievable poor that I feel the need to caution people before they waste their money on it. I bought it out of curiousity, and now regret exchanging any money at all for this. I am not lying when I say this - STAY CLEAR OF THIS 'BOOK'"
2,Sleeper,"Hi everybody, I've been watching anime for a long time now and there are many that I like a lot such as evangelion, Armitage, and Tank Police. I heard good things about this movie so I went out and rented it right away. I was at first thinking wow this is cool looking because of the CG backgrounds, but then was like wow, they get boring quickly. I first tried to watch this movie but grew tired of it after 20 minutes. I then tried again and fell asleep an hour into the movie. The movie could have been half decent but I didn't like the ""story"" of it and the imaging got very redundant after a while, it was like playing Final Fantasy and wathcing the cutscenes. I did give this a two star rating ony because it put me to sleep and I have mild insomnia so it was a good help!"
5,Why do people hate this movie? I could give it 50 stars!,"This is Rintaro's best work since Galaxy Express 999. The imagery is accompanied by a great score and good CGI. This is loosely based on the Godfather Of Manga (Osamu Tezuka)'s equally excellent (although slightly diferent) manga. The DVD is fine too. That teeny-tiny Pocket DVD is loaded with a great special about the making of this gem and more! Oh, Metropolis, I can't stop lovin' you!"
5,You will treasure this forever!,"I just got the dvd in today and watched it! It is the best movie I have ever seen! The animation was the awesome! The art was not really anime style but more cartoonish however it goes great with it! Some people might rate the movie one less a star because of its outdated graphics, but the graphics first of all wern't all that bad and they went good with the movie. This is one movie you will never forget! One movie you will treasure forever! A great flick! The music might not be my taste but it went good with the film. I'm almost speachless on what ells to say! This movie is worth it! Better than Princes Mononoke and Akira!"
2,Beautiful but empty,"Visually this is one impressive movie. Unfortunately the beauty was merely skin-deep. The characters lack any real substance, and are out of place in the world that is created.It promises alot, but ultimately falls far short in its delivery. It is worth a reantal, but certainly not a purchase."
1,Useless as a textbook,"This is quite possibly the worst ""textbook"" I have ever had to use. For a product called ""engaging learning"", it failed to engage me at all. I agree with other reviewers that the language structure is unnecessarily formal; it's like he is constructing an elaborate bedtime story with grand physical gestures rather than trying to teach something academic. I was not impressed with the linguistic runaround and smoke-and-mirrors outline format.Professors should take note: don't require this text as supplemental class material. It's a waste of your students' time and money."
2,good but very basic,"a very basic overview fo the situation; does not include major players like BTS, SMG, Real Learning that are the worlds number 1 in simulation these days from invoicing and development of simulations."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"it doesn't work--you have to shove the dirty diapers down the ""hatch"". The lid makes a loud noise when you shut it. We're throwing it away after a couple of weeks of use!!"
4,"Very good for the price, although not ideal","This is a good product, that does a good job at controlling smell, as long as you replace batteries and filter as frequently as needed.PROS:I very much appreciate the fact that I can use it with any garbage bag. Some other systems require their specific bags, which means that the price for the system is higher than it looks.CONS:The mechanism that closes the bag automatically is a good idea, but could use some improvement, namely:- It is made of cheap plastic; do not push hard on it if the diaper does not go through, or you will break it.- It would be a lot easier (and less dangerous for the mechanism) if the opening for the diaper were wider. As it is now, if your baby is not *very* young, you will probably often have to repeatedly open/close the lid, before the diaper disappears.Overall, considering the competitors, it is a good system for the price, just close it gently (and repeatedly, if necessary)."
1,Horrible,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Cover has a piece that breaks weekly. Room always stinks because the sensor does not turn the unit on when you close it. Struggled with it for 1 years. It's in the garbage now. Don't waste your money. Buy a diaper genie. The cost of the bags is offset by having a room that smells nice and less hassle."
1,crappy crap disposal system,"What a p.o.s.! From day one neither my wife nor myself could determine if this thing was even on or not. It chewed up batteries like it was but we saw no functionality. As for ""swallowing"" diapers, we had to shove our hands down the things throat to make the diapers go down. What a joke."
2,don't like it,Extremly LOUD. Diapers do not go through. You have to open/close the lid ten times. But once there it doesn't smell
5,Great diaper pail!,"I love this diaper pail. You can use any type of garbage bag, even a grocery store bag in a pinch! We never have any problem with odor, and it is really easy to use and empty. I would recommend it to everyone!"
4,Go Get Him Cricket,This book was so well written and exciting it made me want to read her sister's books. Loved them all.
2,Disappointing,"As a Texan, I enjoy reading about the early days of the Republic, but Joan Johnston makes some historical mistakes that jarred me out of the novel several times, and Cricket's father Rip just isn't a sympathetic character at all. Johnston tries to convince us he's a loving father, but the man is frankly a child abuser and no motivation justifies his treatment of his daughters. She also made some errors with Comanche culture, especially the Numu language. This series is entertaining if you simply want to read a romance, but fans who select historical fiction tend to be quite knowledgeable about their favorite time periods, and WILL catch glitches. I think this talented author could have been a bit more careful with her research and the novel would have been MUCH more entertaining. For that reason, only two stars."
3,"Very, very small for 3+","I got this set today, the helmet is very small even for my 2Yrs old daughter, her pediatrician has always said that she has a small head.:) Well, this helmet will be good for just few more months since it fits her just right with not room to grow, the elbow/ knees pads are useless the are very small (TIGHT) it hurts her legs and arms, I read other reviews saying that this set was very small for toddlers, they are right. I wanted it to give it a try since my daughter is very petite, (she was born 5 weeks early). So Nope, I do not recomended this set for toddlers, maybe for infants not older then 20 months. My daughter's head is 19 1/2 inches. The quality of the product is good for the price it's nice and look sturdy I just wish the helmet and pads were little bigger."
2,N is for Not As Good as Usual,"As a die-hard Sue Grafton fan, I look forward to each new alphabetical adventure. Grafton books are among the very few ""beach books"" that I buy in hardcover because I simply cannot wait a year for the paperback edition. Unfortunately, ""N is for Noose"" is not up to Ms. Grafton's usual skills. The plot is convoluted. The characters, while generally interesting, sometimes are introduced in such a cursory fashion that I had to list them inside my back cover just to keep track of who was who. It was obvious from the very beginning ""who done it"" and the explanation of why it was done was not worth the wait. So why two stars rather than none? The book rates two stars because Ms Grafton's prose is easy-reading and natural. Even with a weak plot, the book is a pleasant read. Maybe a better story-line will be forthcoming in ""O is for ..."""
3,Not up to the usual Sue Grafton standard.,"When I read or listened to A through M, I could barely put the books down at night or shut off the cassette player. I was able to get to bed early while reading N is for Noose. The usual cast of characters were missing and the story moved along slowly (until the very end).I would love to hear Judy Kaye read the unabridged version of Sue Grafton's audio books. She is very animated and adds life to the books."
3,N is for Not so Great Grafton,"I could hardly get through the first 100 pages of this book. It took me 1 week because I kept getting bored with it. It usually takes me about 4 days to read an entire Sue Grafton novel. I thought it picked up and was beginning to get interesting and I did suspect the killer the entire time so why didn't Kinsey? I thought the way she revealed why the killer killed Tom was very quick with no real clear explanation for why he did it. It was just given to us as a hunch and Kinsey never discussed it with the killer as she has before. I can only hope ""O"" is much better. I have read all of Sue Grafton's novels and this one was my least favorite of all. It is especially dissapointing when you wait an entire year for the new books to come out. I will continue to read the Grafton books but lets all hope in the next one Kinsey is back to her old self in Santa Teresa with Henry, Rosie and all of the others that feel like family. We missed them this time."
3,Did I miss something?,"I eagerly awaited this book as I've completely enjoyed her other novels. The character, Kinsey, was enjoyable and witty as always; however, I found myself frustrated about 1/3 to 1/2 way into the book. Basically, there was not enough development of the characters in Nota Lake and the first 140 some odd pages basically kept sending Kinsey into dead ends (in my opinion). When, finally, the end arrived, you saw it coming and it was wrapped up so fast you were left wanting more. In hindsight, I now see the clues interspersed in the beginning, but they were so vague that you completely missed them.As I read the other reviews, I am truly left wondering what I missed! This installment did not have the same snap, crackle, and pop of her earlier escapades."
1,A dull and very slow read,"This was my first Grafton novel, and unless I take the word of a few other reviewers-that prior works in this series were much better-it will be my last. There was essentially no plot and little character development. I agree with another reviewer, that perhaps this is what the trivial, day-to-day activities of a real-life PI might be like. I only finished it to see if at least there was an interesting twist in the solution of the case. I was disappointed to the end."
3,Not Kinsey's best outing,"By now, Grafton's heroine, Kinsey Millhone, is well established amongst the ranks of female detectives. This book possibly isnlt the best of the series.I found it a little disappointing in that it plods somewhat and I wasnlt at all guessing to the end - to me the perpetrator stood out a mile off. I found some of the peripheral characters just plain boring."
1,A total lack of action/suspense,"The book was thoroughly boring for the first 150 pages. It took Grafton took long to get to the ""meat"" of the story. The ending seemed exciting at first, but it is too far fetched!!"
2,The ending was extremely disappointing .,"I have listened to both the abridged and the unabridged versions of N is for Noose and flipped through the hard cover version and was thoroughly disappointed in the ending...The rest of the book was very typical of a Kinsey mystery. I didn't mind the change in locale - it did make for variety which is good. The humor wasn't as present, and I did miss that. This was my least favorite book in the series which I adore. I still anxiously await ""O"".I also hope that in the future, she does release unabridged versions and that she has them narrated by Judy Kaye. I found that Mary Pfeiffer just didn't cut it - I've grown accustomed to Judy's voice since ""A"" and don't think anyone else could replace her."
3,Agreed with the other reviewers.,"I have never read any of the author's other books, but after reading this one, I am inclined to take a pass on the others. It is interesting to note that the other reviews really did enjoy the the previous books.I will try the next one in the ""series"", unless there is one in this series which can come very highly recommened."
3,slow starter,"The book was slow to start and was dificult to get into but after several chapters I was able to pick up & not want to stop. Kinsey is a cute character in your books & I enjoy reading about her. I have read all the 'alphabet' books thus far & am awaiting the ""O"" book. Signed: a fan."
3,An enjoyable read but not the best she's written.,"Sue Grafton's work has always been interesting and in N is for Noose that hasn't changed. The characters are well drawn. The story drives you deeper into the mystery but Kinsey doesn't seem to be herself. She doesn't seem as tough as I remember her to be. Overall, the book keeps you focused through til the end but it's not as gripping as past efforts. I will definitely keep reading Grafton's work because she will always come through one way or another."
3,loose as a goose,"""N"" is a middling, mediocre sort of letter (very like ""m"", in fact). No, I much preferred Ms. Grafton's aggressive ""a"". I can hardly wait for her ""s"".Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
2,"The least effective of Grafton's ""alphabet"" series","I am a fan of Grafton and her fictional detective, but she has failed with ""Noose"". What makes Kinsey Milhone and her adventures so compelling is the great cast of characters that Grafton has developed. Let's face it -her plots have never been that complex. In this book,e.g., the culprit was telegraphed from almost the moment he entered to everyone apparently but Kinsey. The problem here is that the book largely takes place away from Kinsey's home base, and the regular characters are brought in only incidentally. The new characters in the remote town are one-dimensional. So Ms. Grafton, get Kinsey back home where she belongs."
2,Is Kinsey ready for retirement?,"Just because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, doesn't mean this series has to run till the bitter end! Especially since at the halfway mark Kinsey seems to be running out of steam. The pace is lackadaisical at best, and the plot is far from original. Neither Grafton nor Kinsey show much interest, so how do they expect the readers to?And if there are future episodes (I know ""O"" is already in the bookstores), then PLEASE give Kinsey a computer, cellphone, etc. Bring this woman into the 21st century! It's ridiculous to still have her searching for phone booths."
2,N is for Not So Fast,"This is the first Sue Grafton book I've read and I have to say that I enjoyed it--UNTIL the ""quickie"" ending, which was such a letdown after having read sooooo many pages to get there. It seemed like the author decided she was tired of writing, couldn't be bothered to explain or justify plot points, and just wanted to be done with it! Such a disappointment."
4,This book was entertaining and great summer reading.,"As a Sue Grafton fan I read all her books with relish. ""N ... "" did not disappoint me. The plot held my attention, although I did know who the ""bad guy"" was long before the end. That is not always the case with Sue Grafton's mysteries."
4,"I happen to like Kinsey, no matter what she's doing!","Although, not to be placed at the top of the heap, I have always enjoyed Kinsey's antics and really enjoy Sue Grafton's writing style. Obviously I don't ""bore"" as easily as most of the other ""critics"". I guess this is because I live in a small town myself and have first hand knowledge of people just like those in this book. In fact, almost everyone in the entire county where I live is like this. Anyway, I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the ""O"" book whatever it is called."
3,**Shocked**,"I had to read this book for a literature class and like most reading assignments, I was not looking forward to it. Once I got a couple pages into the book, I could not put it down. The crazy situations Kinsey gets herself into made it hard to stop flipping through the pages. The intense description Grafton uses on Kinsey's injuries turned my stomach. I was in total suspense up to the last page. I would recommend this book to any one! I truly enjoyed it, I hope you do too!"
1,N Is for NOPE!,"Sue Grafton and her editors should have read the book before it was printed! The first 100 pages drag; the characters are underdeveloped and weak; the most interesting character is already dead (Tom Newquist); the killer is obvious early on (well, early after the plot finally gets underway), and his motive is totally obscure and/or nonexistent! Kinsey is not just maturing if N is typical of the future books--she is AGING BADLY. Her humor and snap have faded; her analytical skills are seriously declining; she has lost her ""edge"" and babbles to the most probable villains everything they want and need to know about her investigation. The ending is improbable, and it is so rushed that the reader gets the feeling Grafton tired of the book or couldn't figure out how to give the killer a motive and/or how to have Kinsey figure out ""who done it,"" so she rushed to get out of the corner she painted Kinsey into. Let's hope O (for Oops?) is back on track."
4,Wolof-English/English-Wolof Dictionary & Phrasebook,"Yes,It is far different than the Wolof that I now, which I learned in Senegal. It seems the Gambian dialect may have more of a Mandinka and Jolla influence. Many of the phrases are different, the spellings seem a little awkward, and the words themselves have changed shape, i.e. spelling and pronunciation, or if not, often are totally different words altogether. Its sort of like reading Appalachian English. I always found the standard Senegalese orthography perfectly condusive to English pronunciation, moreso than to French even. But with these criticisms, I find it a well put together book, and given the affordability of it, and the lack of available texts on this subject, its definately worth having and referencing."
3,A little cheaper quality than I was looking for.,"If you are looking for something to just hold a ton of CDs or DVDs then this would be great for you! However, I was a little disappointed with mine in the quality of the zipper and how it ""works"". It is very ""unprofessional"" looking because there are several inches of a ""zipper flap"" (don't know what else to call it) hanging out the bottom all the time. If this didn't bother me I would have rated it higher but I can't understand why they didn't cut the zipper the correct length and make it more professional looking. As it is, it looks like a very cheap piece... but does serve the function of holding a ton of CDs :)"
2,Marginally there,"There are far better books about death and dying. This collection of thoughts is so personal that the reader feels like s/he is indulging the author just by reading it. There is nothing here that has not been said before and far, far better. But since the author died relatively shortly after writing this, and because he is something of a literary celebrity, we feel compelled to read this as if it were art. It just ain't, folks, and Brautigan knows it. While that is sad somehow, it doesn't make this a good book."
5,¡Excelente!...¡Bravo!,¡Otra vez la hiciste Lalo Schifrin. Eres muy bueno.! Es un placer escuchar esto. Gracias.
2,I just don't like this one,"In stark contrast to the other glowing reviews here, I have to say I just don't like this one. I purchased it because I'm a big Wilco fan and I really think Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett made a great team. Unfortunately, The Jay Bennett/Ed Burch collaboration does nothing for me. These songs are just not very good and are really uninteresting. The majority of them give you the feeling you've heard them before. In fact, Jay sings like a Elvis Costello clone (Track 3 sounds like an Elvis Costello cover band). I can't imagine recommending this over Yankee Hotel Foxtrot!"
5,Pleasant surprise,"This CD is a step or two removed from Wilco, but in a good way. Though B&B's singing voices are not on the level of Jeff Tweedy, musically they're as good if not better. The first five or six songs are catchy as hell, and worth having on their own."
3,worth it for the music alone...,"Don't let the cover fool you, its not that exciting of a movie. In fact, I don't recall ever seeing a tongue ring in the movie at all... and it really begins to drag at points...Still, its an educational flick and worth a watch just for the music. Its a docudrama on the legendary Tony Wilson, his idealistic lovechild Factory Records, his club and his career. Put together like an 80s punk video and with a soundtrack by bands like Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays who reigned in Manchester, England, it is an interesting look at the music scene of bands of the era. This movie is basically a VH1 special, but with more swearing. I enjoyed it, but its more of a niche piece than anything."
2,Didn't get. didn't understand did not like. pacing,"I gave this film a few chances.Could not get into it. Didn't get the vibe, nothing to do with the history. Didn't understand essentially. didn't see the hype. eventually got to twenty minutes before quitting and I'm a huge Brit alt 80s fan."
1,24 Hour Boredom,"This movie, or whatever it entails itself to be, is nothing but a collection of small parts that make it totally unreliable. It is so boring, that one not only begins to hate British, because they are portrayed as chain smoking, cussing, prostitute visiting, sobs who do nothing but say the F word and sit on the cold sidewalk. The film was supposed to be about the Factory record label which signed up one of the best bands of all time, Joy Division but as the actors are so terrible, all we get is the Ian Curtis look alike who does nothing but prance around the stage all day pretending to look cool. This movie is not recommend to anyone at all because it isn't even a good tool for sleep."
1,horrible - don't waste your money,"I haven't seen the second one in this series as I didn't realize that there was a second one when I rented this one last night. I thought it would be close to the first one in the series but when I looked at who the actor and actress for the King and Queen - I was disappointed. The actress that played the Queen was horrible. Most of the characters in this film didn't act - they just read their lines. I sure won't rent the second one, why bother!"
1,Same as HooDoo Mysteries,"I have to say that this book is the same as Malbroughs HooDoo mysteries. It has almost nothig to do with real HooDoo. I live in New Orleans and like I said on my review for Malbroughs book, Noone I know practices HooDoo like this. If you want root work then check out Cat Yarowande's work, it is atleast acurate."
5,Jetson's and Flinstones together on dvd!,It's about time!!! I LOVE this show! I used to watch it all the time on vhs when I was younger. Now I can retire my worn out vhs.
4,"great nostalgia, good movie","this movie was really enjoyable. i'd forgotten how great these two shows are. my favorite characters elroy, rosie, and jane are still as awesome as ever, as are wilma, betty, and barney. includes all the little things i'd forgotten about the originals, like little puns thrown in and the machine/animals in the flinstones making comments. this 90+ min movie is a little disjoint and the two families are only actually together for one section, but it's a great gimmick. highlights include barney dressing as a woman, wilma and betty trying out jane's hair and makeup robots, and elroy mowing the lawn -- the first time he's ever seen grass. all in all a load of fun. i'm going to have to track down the other movies now."
5,great unit,THIS IS A GREAT UNIT FOR BATTERY BACK UP RUNS ALOT EQUIPMENT. BUY IT YOU AND WON'T REGREAT IT!!!!!
4,The Best Basketball Game out.,"This game is Awesome any game that you can play or watch a highschool team play has to be nice,not including the gameplay is better than any NBA game out.The A.I. is very smart the gameplays so smooth that if this was first person it would be the best period.I have not liked SegaSports since they left the Dreamcast but this brought back some of that great Dreamcast gameplay."
5,alsome,the very mystic uses of the bible the dead speak latin the un born child of god saves many and the shadows of god on a cross spreads among all
2,stop please,"at this point it would be far better legacy-wise to stop this release of new stuff until they get to the point to where they can groom it like they once did in the heyday. this is weak, bordering on hhhhhhhhhhhweak.....does every album ever get 4 stars on here?? this is funny. pyro is 5 and this is 4??? yeah, right...."
4,Rock'n high energy here,"Def Leppard blew my mind when I first heard Photograph back in 83. I've been a die hard fan ever since. I was skeptical about this glam rock cover album though. I mean why would an 80's band reinvent themselves as a 70's band? In short, I love some songs and hate others, but the good outweighs the bad by far and I'd recommend it to any fan.Whether you love or hate various tracks, one thing is undeniable... there is a lot of raw rock'n high energy here (the likes of which we haven't heard from this band in a while). I'm hopeful this will carry forward to their next original album."
4,Love this CD!,"This is an awesome CD. I received it as a Christmas present, and I listen to it at least twice a week. Some of the songs I knew, others I didn't. ""Hanging on the Telephone"" and ""Waterloo Sunset"" are my favs from the CD, but they are all good. I last saw the band in concert about 1 1/2 years ago, and they performed ""No Matter What"" and ""Rock On"" during the set. ""Rock On"" brought the arena to a frenzy. They should definitely perform more of the songs from ""YEAH"" in concert."
2,Could have been better,Def Leppard has realy disappointed me with this CD. It's like they have lost most of there music writing ability. I think they need to go back to the drawing board and dig deep into there feelings to come up with a new sound. Doing covers of songs is for newbies not for established rock stars. This is not a put down to the group for I have 99% of there work and have always like them. They have jest lost there way and I hope they find it soon.
5,Some excellent Irish music,"I found the music (like the show) to be entertaining and energetic. As for the music fan who said ""Michael Flatleys flute playing is to airy"". Well did you know that he won the Irish Flute playing championship. So unless you can play better why don't you cut the guy some slack."
4,Very attractive,I bought this for my husband for his birthday! So far so good! He likes it and found it very fun to see the atomic time setting. Very accurate. he loves stainless steel. Hope it lasts!
2,Disapointing,First failure: Restaining strap came apart. Replacement cost for strap more than the watch.2nd failure: Wouldn't change with global time change.3 rd failure. Just quit. Never able to get started right.Looking for replacement.
1,Unreliable,"I was given this watch as a gift in November of 2006. Less than one year later I noticed the time was 5 minutes slow. After several emails with the distributor to correct the problem, I was told to ship the watch back. When I received the watch, the problem was fixed for about 2 or 3 weeks then it went back to being 5 minutes slow again. I emailed the company again, several times, and so far they've ignored me.Great concept but not worth the price tag if they can't stand behind the product."
1,Horrible - And This is From A Barbra Fanatic,"I have all her movies, every cd, every concert on Dvd. WHEN I SEEN THIS I COULDNT EVEN GET THROUGH IT. I hated every minute of it, except the minutes where she was solo, which was only around 4 songs. This was terrible and i cant believe it was put out seperatly, i have the boxset and this one has never been touched since the first time i had it in the dvd player. DONT BUY IT SEPERATLY."
4,Birding CO with Holt in my pocket,"My trip was unfortunately shortened, but I did have a chance to use it in the northern prairie area and in Eastern Co, and it was indeed very useful. It helped cut the guess work on where to go and what I might see when I got there. An update to this helpful guide would be excellent. I give it four feathers up!By the way, I ordered the book just before I left for CO and received it well in time. If I recall it is out of print and I got it used through Amazon. The book arrived in mint condition."
5,sometimes ducks say quack quack,"real sick debut alblum from washington dc's trial by fire. if you like kid dynamite, strike anywhere, maybe some anti-flag you'll have an ear-gasim over this record. if not. sorry for you. with their politcally charged blend of punk/hardcore, trial by fire sure to make you think, laugh, cry, and poop your pants, before you can say quack, quack."
3,DId it's job for one year.,"Arm snapped off after one year of use.Was okay up until then.Will add the toilet paper does fall off arm if toilet paper is pulled too hard.Pretty sure that is normal with such a design. Just worth noting.Also, I didn't really think how it would look once the toilet paper was stacked as per design.Not as pretty as I imagined it. Toilet paper, even when new, still has a tab (glue that keeps it from unraveling not on first sheet) that makes everything look messy once stacked. Maybe I just don't find exposed toilet paper as appealing as I initially though when I purchased this."
1,Xenophobia,"Since most supporters of this book probably don't understand what a word like ""Xenophobia"" means, let me spell it out for you. Simply defined, Xenophobia means an irrational fear of foreigners.Irrational fear and simple racism is what this book is all about. This is Mein Kampf and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion all wrapped up in a pretty, academic-like package. Hatred of the other never has been the answer and it still isn't the answer. Leave this hate-filled polemic in the dust bin of history and move on to a more accepting society."
5,been there,"I would greatly appriciate it if you would contact Ms. Aronson for me and pass along my email address. There is a lady in need of her help, her son has unexplained scars since he was 4 years old and fears ""the big eyes"" he is now 17 and suicidal. Please help us he is her only child... Thank you, Hilda S. Rubio"
3,made in china,"I was so deceived by the name E.Howard,it was supposed to be a watch with a long proud company history.I was very disappointed to find that it is 100% made in China"
1,6 Minutes Slow,"I have had this watch for 2 years. I have worn it all around the globe. It keeps accurate time, I just have to adjust for it being 6 minutes slow. No way to adjust it that I know of. I would not buy another one."
3,OK but not GREAT,"Worked great until the battery died...have been unable to find anyone who can change the battery. For the price, would not recommend."
1,I really wanted to like this!,"To give you some background info., I am a fitness instructor and I take cross-fit and boot-camp style classes all of the time. When I popped this in my DVD player, I was very disappointed. Not only does the instructor move a bit too fast for a DVD, the movements are a bit ridiculous (Imagine there are five circles on the ground and move in this direction and imagine you are jumping through tires, etc.). I would save your money and go to YouTube and look up boot-camp workout videos or check out BodyRock.tv for some real instructing."
1,Major Mastering error!,"I have written to the On Reflection email list as well as DRT Entertainment about this problem as well. Its unratable as it is because it is such a glaring mistake. Perhaps this issue will be worth something someday. It is interesting in that you can hear the parts that are evident with a deconstructionust ear,(like the Scraping the Barrel box set which is amazing!). But I really want to hear this album in particular mastered correctly."
2,Lasted less than 1 year,"I had submitted a review in February after owning this iron for about 10 months. Now that I have owned it a year and no longer have a warranty it has quit working. It is a great iron, but only plan to have it for a year. If you are only interested in a short time using a great iron, and then spending the 100+ dollars again, then GET THIS IRON. I was VERY disappointed when it broke, as I thought I'd get 2-3 years out of it. It is made really lightweight...so I guess it should not have surprised me. I just hate spending more money so soon. I am going to send it to the company and see if they will help me. SAVE your receipt. I typically ALWAYS do, but for some reason I can't find this one. ugh"
1,Two have had faulty wires!!,"I LOVED my Sedu!!! I loved it so much that I purchased a second one because the first one got a short in the wire after I had it for a while. I bought my second one off of an auction site and within 2 months, the same thing happened! There is a short in the wire and it won't stay on. I contacted them to see if they will except an exchange although I do not have a receipt or the original packaging. I have yet to hear back. Although this has been the best flat iron I have ever used, I will not purchase another and suggest that you do not waste your money on this as it doesn't last long!"
1,Flat iron,"It looked used and had pieces of hair and makeup stuck between the iron plates. Overall, I was not satisfied with this product."
3,Catches your hair at the ends,"Bought this iron because of all the good reviews. It's really light in weight but it catches the ends of your hair too tightly I feel..maybe because the blades close in on it so tight.. also.. the blinking light and on/off switch and temp dial is located near at the hinge of the tool, rather than on the top side of one of the arms.. making it kind of hard to see at times. small and compact but not as great as everyone says...doesn't glide as smooth as T3 irons"
4,This Sedu Flat Iron replaces my maxiglide steam flat iron!,"I was using Maxiglide for about two years, and the steam from the maxiglide was reverting my 4B&4C hair back to its supercurly state while I was trying to straighten my hair with it. Also the so-called detangling pins on my maxiglide was getting tangled in my hair, and causing some breakage. So, when my maxiglide started to leak, and I knew it was time to throw it in thegarbage. I felt lost, but i had a new sedu flat iron that I never had used before, and I used itthis morning and I straighted my hair on the360 heat temperature dial, and wow! this seduis a nice straightener, but someone told me that the Babyliss flat irons can beat the seduflat irons. Well in the future I will see if the babyliss flat irons can beat the sedu. For now I will continue to use my sedu flat iron."
5,Nappy no more,"Okay I never write product reviews, but this thing is seriously AMAZING! I have super kinky coarse hair and have tried all kinds of straightening methods and products. I had a Chi Turbo for years until it finally broke, and decided with all of the amazing reviews on this product I'd give it a try. Man were they right! You would NEVER know I had any kind of kink to my hair at all after I straighten it with the Sedu. It's so silky and shiny too! And the best part about it is its size. I was disappointed at how small it was at first, but what a joy to my shoulder. It's super light and compact. Seriously buy this! I would have spent 200 on it no problem so for 80 you really can't pass it up. It's amazing!"
2,Sorry Sedu doesn't cut it for me!,"Ughh, let me just say how shocked I was on the body of this flat iron. It is very cheaply made. Compared to other flatirons in the same price category, I was so shocked that this is what people have been hyping. What is the hype about?! I flat ironed my african american kinky hair and it did a sub par job. It wasn't anything to run home about. I actually had to grab hold of my other iron to finish off the job. This flat iron is seriously overpriced!!! I'd soo prefer a solia!"
5,"Wonderful Wedding Music from Palestine, A Preservation Of Our Culture!","Wonderful Wedding Music from Palestine, a pefect example of the beauty that is apart of the Palestinian culture. The preservation of anything to do with real Palestine is important because we as a people need to be heard and understood. We have a wonderful culture that is threatened everyday that our country is occupied. So many of us are refugee's in countries that are not our home and a CD like this teaches that we are a good people. And that what is happening to us, is a travesty to humanity."
4,Bright white photo paper,"Kodak matte photo paper works just fine in my canon printer. I like the bright white in it and the photo prints look real nice. If you are used to a heavy/normal photo paper weight, you will know this feels very thin but it has a nice feel. Nice for my family pictures. Nice price."
3,A Mixed Bag of verilog,"The early chapters are an excellent guide to the syntax and wiring connections, they clearly outline potential pitfalls. Chapters 5 & 6 cover designs from too low a level. I'm sure other real-world designers will agree that modeling a flip-flop with gates just flops. I'm on Ch. 7 now and except for a reference on (min:typ:max) back to (yech!) chapter 5 the author finally gets back to real world design and synthesis (though he doesn't differentiate). Design for synthesis is a different animal than test design and where they diverge should be hi-lighted. But the explanations are clear and eventually the important levels of verilog design are covered. So if read thoughtfully it is a very good intro to verilog, but beware the useless filler."
4,A very good introduction book.,"This book was a good introduction to Verilog. It was some what short in content in some areas, specifically timing analysis. It is easy to understand and the examples on disk run under any simulator. This book is a good learning tool and used with a good reference is a definite book to have on your desk."
4,"Move over, Chipmunks!","I don't know who these guys are, or where they came from, but WOW. Messrs. Rizvi and Wilgus manage (with almost no additional help - that's a very short list of guest musicians in those liner notes) to breath new life into stock Christmas tunes you thought you'd never want to hear again. I know I didn't, until a friend played the CD for me. The respectful serenity of the opening medley caught my ear, and then the so-sweet-my-molars-ache arrangement of ""Winter Wonderland,"" sung by Wilgus, had me hooked. And these guys are no slouches, either. The quality of arrangements, musicianship, recording, etc., are SO good... you really can't stop listening once you start. Young or old, devout or Godless, there's something for everyone on this CD. (sniff) I might even go to Church this Xmas."
2,Cheap hose,"I must preface my review that I can not speak to the sealing effectiveness of this product as the compressor seized during the road test. The hose it comes with is crap, plain and simple. Its suposed to be a quick release and seal up but it didnt, instead after i disconnected it the hose sprayed a nasty sticky, oily foam. So even if the compressor had lived im not too sure about if the sealer would have even done the job. Lesson learned, always test the viability of the system before adding expesnsive additives."
2,Music to sleep by,"Definitely not DeDanaan or any of the other dynamic groups. The music is pretty - very pretty. Eight tracks of pretty. Sit back, relax, have a drink and fall asleep reading the paper kind of pretty.Good background music. Probably nothing here that your band will want to learn."
5,FULL OF GRAFFITI,Getting up is one of the best book i've ever seen. It contains more about graf. so Craig Castleman had a good job for readers!
1,Bad Product...Even worse customer service.,I ordered this product and got it in about a week...which was not a big deal b/c I didn't want to pay the extra shipping charge for UPS. After I recieved the product it did not charge my battery after an overnight charge. I called about the product and they said they would send me a replacement...it two weeks to get here and they didn't even offer to send it UPS or try to help me track it. Bottom line 4 weeks and 2 chargers later I have a dead camera battery and I missed taking photos at my son's birthday party. Thanks a lot Bargain Cell.
3,A rich girl with step family problems runs away from home.,This movie is extrememly enjoyable to watch again and again
3,Not All I Hoped,I was hoping for more info for the shore fisherman. It gave tips on a few accsess points and baits/lures. All maps are boating charts.
5,"A vividly written book, one of my definite favorties","I liked this book a lot because of the main character. Cynthia Voigt makes here a trustworthy person, and when you read about Dicey, you feel as if you've known her for a long time. She has realitic feelings, like anyone else, which is rare for a main character in many books. I'd recommend this book to anyone, because It makes you think a lot about yourself and what happens in the book. Dicey faces lots of problems, and settles them in her own way. She pulls through with the help of her new friends, and mostly, herself. I liked her grandmother, because she didn't really mind what other people thought about her, but she knew she had to care for her grandchildren. I don't knon why some people gave this book a low rating, because I loved it!"
3,Fine...,"At first when I read this book, I was bored out of my wits. I had to read this book for a school project, which I really didn't want to do. I almost fell asleep during the first 50 pages of the book. But near the end, the plot got a lot better and I enjoyed it more. It was very interesting, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the first book in the Tillerman series. I had many questions, like- Why was the mother mentally ill? How did they get with Gram? etc. But his is a great book that pulls you into the story, especially at the very end. I know I put in 3 stars for this book, but I would rather have put in 3 and a half- I really enjoyed this."
5,Must Read,I had to read this book for my psychology class and I instantly got hooked. It is well worth the price and I know you will enjoy it as much as I did.
4,Into Archive.,This book is a nice addition to my collection of books on spinning and weaving. I hope it's knowledge will be and aide to my being able to spin properly.
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT...................,"THE BOOK COVERS MAINLY UNIT DEPLOYMENTS AND OPERATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT USED. BUT THERE ARE NO PERSONAL STORIES OR ACCOUNTS OF AIRCREW RESCUES,WHICH IS THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT IT. A RATHER DRY HISTORY FOR SOMEONE LOOKING FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF COMBAT SEARCH AND RESCUE,I RECOMMEND PASSING UP THIS TITLE FOR ANOTHER ONE,SUCH AS "" THE RESCUE OF STREETCAR 304"" BY KENNY FIELDS , OR ""CHEATING DEATH"" BY GEORGE MARRETT."
3,Good camera but a real energy sapper,I have used many digital cameras before but never owned any. This is my first digicam.1. I liked the camera coz it is light and easy to carry around2. The picture quality is amazing and i will believe it is 8.1 MP3. The real disadvantage is that it drains battery so much that it won't last for even 30 min in total when u start taking movies. (I believe i put on new pair of batteries coz they came along with the camera)It is time for samsung to put a rechargeable battery in the camera itself. Changing Ni-Cd batteries and charging them in turns is a real pain.
1,"Very fragile, lens get stuck easily","Length:: 1:09 MinsWhat can I say, just google for samsung s800 stuck lens.This is a very low quality, fragile camera, I wouldnt recommend it."
2,Too Much Violence,"Adults know the Dragon Slayer Academy series is fantasy. For young readers, we find the mention of violence in the books (Trip to Cave of Doom) inappropriate. We don't think it good for young readers (2nd grade) to be exposed to dragons being stabbed in their eyes & heart to kill them and executioners putting people's necks on tree stumps& chopping their heads off with an axe. Fantasy is great, reading is great but content is everything. Caveat emptor."
5,cerebral,"The kind of cd you'd want to bring along when you go on holiday to outer space. Clever, intelligently crafted. Not to be missed."
5,the wait is over,I have been a fan since the beginning and have been waiting for this CD. I love it! Yes it is different but what is wrong with that? Every song on this CD is so good and I haven't stopped playing it since I got it.
3,The downward spiral continues . . .,"As I listen to this cd for the first time, I don't hear a thing that reminds me of what this kid used to be. Jonny's first cd was great. He had so much potential. The second cd wasn't bad, but it got away from what made Jonny Jonny. This cd sounds like every other mainstream rock disc that's out right now, and that is disappointing. Definitely not worth the 5 years I waited for it. It does have a couple of good tracks, one of which he didn't write (Red Light). Maybe after a couple more spins this disc will grow on me, but I'm afraid ""Long Time Coming"" will soon be a long time gone."
3,"ah come on, y'all!!","with what's been coming out, this is really a pretty good rock album ... this IS NOT elmore james, ok??? this is not delta blues, nor even chicago blues, but it's not THAT bad!!! i played the strokes new disc, and there wasn't one song i wanted to hear again ... not one! it stunk. this disc has 3 or 4 songs that are pretty good listens ... the cover of ""livin' for the city"", ""red light"", ""give me up again"" ... you'll like them enough. this isn't stevie ray or clapton, nor buchanan ... it's jonny lang, doing rock and roll. i'm very distressed about the lack of listenable stuff coming out ... this one's not that bad."
3,Could have waited a little longer,"Now I was a big Jonny Lang fan, but I don't like the direction that his record company took him with this album. It will be seen as a betrayal many of Jonny's fans that wanted and really enjoyed Jonny's guitar work and maturing voice doing what he does best, the blues. I was hoping that this album would include ""Irish Eyes"", but instead it contained a mish mosh attempt to go mainstream. I've played it quite a few times since it came hoping that it would grow on me. Instead it's becoming annoying. No Jonny playing the guitar that way he can and not clean strong voice doing the blues beyond his years.What a sad, bad attempt to sell out. I hope that it sells enough to keep him afloat long enough to get back to the music that made him popular in the first place. I just spent $200 for Jonny Lang concert tickets for a couple of friend and I sure hope he steers clear of most of this junk when he plays."
4,Artists deserve the right to create from their hearts,"If you're on the fence, don't bother with reviews. Half the album can be heard at jonnylang.com, and the samples are full length. But, to also add my two cents, I find this disc to be soulful and refreshing. If you're a fan of Amanda Marshall, as I am, you will love this. If you're looking for something bluesy, skip it... that's not what's being offered."
1,Honestly? Horrifying.,"After hearing a handful of his older songs and loving them, I figured I'd finally go ahead and get one of his cds. This is so far from where he started, and his sound has just been degenerated into this cold, easy-listening stuff that is just so far from the blues that I wanted to vomit."
4,finding his way,"I saw Mick Jagger when he was about Jonny Lang's age now and can't help but notice the similarity between the two in regards to the Blues/rock/RB sound that they both seem to favor. Granted Lang doesn't have Jagger's stage presence yet but Jagger doesn't have Lang's guitar ability now or ever. Voices are similar and if Lang sticks with it (like Jagger) he will far surpass Jagger in the blues/soul/rock arena. I predict this album ,youthfully flawed, is just the beginning for Lang as a mainstream artist....and there is nothing wrong with making albums that appeals to a majority of people as that is one of the driving force behind creative genius...it's just that appealing to the masses can't be the only driving force...and with Lang it isn't..rock on"
2,"Oh Jonny, you could do so much better!","I tried to give this a chance, but all I could think of was ""80's Hair Bands"". I had flashbacks of Bon Jovi and other things I want to forget.Jonny is so talented, but he needs to get away from his Prince influence. Too many high notes.He has great lyrics, but the accompanyment needs to be destroyed."
2,Too Long Time Coming,"I am a big fan of Jonnys' and have followed his career from its inception. This effort is not a blues CD of any genre I can think of. This unfortunately is Joony trying to be something else. When I recall seeing him live and watching the young people in the audience connect with him in a way they might never had with a traditional blues artist, I was excited for both Jonny and his audience......as I could see that some would start the journey into ""getting the blues"". I am not excited by this CD, I suspect that he has become more of a ""rock/pop"" star than desiring to continue to be a blues influence. While I would give his 3 previous recordings a 4-5 star review, I can only cough 2 for you this time, Jonny. Get that Tele Thinline wound up, get rid of the drum tracks and Protools programming junk that pop ""artists"" use and get out on the road and play before someone else replaces you."
1,What? No more Blues from JL?,"Don't know why he decided to quit playing the blues. Smokin' and Lie To Me are most definitely blues albums, even if you want to say that they're R&B 'influenced'. It took me a while to get used to 'Wander This World', but I have so I decided to buy this album. Am very disappointed in this undertaking. Think I'm going to send my copy over to the local lite rock and pop station. Consider this former fan alienated and disgruntled. DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BLUES, 'CUZ IT AIN'T HERE."
2,Not so wonderful.,"Typically the more I listen to an album, the more I find to like about it. Well, this is the exact opposite. The first time I listened, I thought it sounded okay, but I quickly grew to dislike much of the album. Lang is just trying to hard. One of the fun things about Johnny Lang back when he was a 14 year old guitar prodigy is that he could care less about hit singles or charts. This entire album seems to be an attempt to score a commercial hit. And while songs like ""Red Light"" may score him some radio play, it just isn't what he does best. So if you want a Lang album, just go listen to Lie to Me."
2,"Jonny, what have you done to yourself?","This disc is a huge disappointment! What happened to the young blues guitar slinger I really liked? He has completely changed his style and I was hoping we finally had a new blues musician that would grow and grow into a blues great! This in not blues at all. I suspect his producers at A&M thought they saw someone to make money from, but this is eclectic garbage although his voice is still great. Go back to what you do best Jonny - blues."
2,NOT BLUES!!,"I got this cd to hear Jonny Lang's good blues sound he usually has. I was very disapointed. His guitar was played more in the back ground. And except for ""Long Time Coming"" the whole cd was pop. And Jonny lang could never compare to SRV. SRV is the greatest."
1,RIP WHERE'S THE PASSION,"THE WORST ALBUM I BOUGHT IN YEARS - I WONT WASTE MY MONEY ON HIS MUSIC AGAIN UNLESS MY TASTES CHANGE TO BE BORING AND LIFELESS. HIS NEW MATURE IMAGE UNDER THE THEME OF ""ARTIST LOOKING FOR NEW DIRECTIONS"" IS SO LIMP YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW THIS WAS THE SAME BOY WONDER OF THE BLUES.NOTHING WRONG WITH THE OLD DIRECTION - LIE TO ME AND WANDER THIS WORLD WERE SO DIVERSE AND PASSIONATE. THANKS FOR SELLING OUT TO BE A POP STAR."
2,Stick to the blues,"Jonny is trying to be something between Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and a blues phenomenon. Stick to the blues boy. Your voice and guitar are made for that. Although your voice is great there is too much of this type of music."
1,Total disappoinment,"I am a big fan J.Lang and this album was a total disappointment.What made his previous albums so good was the raw edged music and vocals. This effort is over produced and doesn't distinguishitself and any way,shape,or form. If this is what we can expectin the future he has lost a loyal fan."
1,WARNING!!! NO BLUES! LIGHT POP!,"Poor Johnny must have gotten sick of the blues. There is no sign of the great blues he played on his first 3 outings. This is instead a collection of light pop music where he sings in a falsetto voice often. If you like elevators you will like this. If you like Johnny Lang's masterful Blues, you will be GREATLY disapointed, and will most likely use this disc as a coaster."
5,Set the Bar,"I've been a fan of Jonny's since his little blue-eyed blues prodigy days. The kid is still only 22 years old. His blessing and his curse is that he can do so many diferent things so darn well. EXCUSE HIM for experimenting, for wanting to try it all!!If he didn't have so much powerful, god-given talent and had the bar not been set so high so early, you wouldn't hear near the griping right now. Waa, we want the old Jonny back--He's changing from a blues purist to a rock nonoriginal!!!This kid's got more soul in his voice and how he handles that guitar than anyone to come along in forever. With so many ""artists"" out there doing fey, cynical, posed-oh-so-cool work----Give me a kid who still has the goods to turn out hot music with passion and guts. What's he gonna do next? I can't wait. Cause it could be anything!"
1,Not the Jonny I know,"If you enjoy Lang's previous music, don't buy this release - ignorance is bliss. Jonny was an excellent blues singer and guitar player, now, it seems, he is just a middle of the road pop musician who's work is not much distinguished from the rest of the pop."
1,Save your Time and Money,"I was looking forward to this book, because I knew there was a lot of new and complicated material on the 70-216 exam. First, I couldn't believe how few pages were in the book. Second, there are no questions or practices that key into the Microsoft exam. The book is so hard to read, I actually had to go to the Help file to figure out what they were trying to say! I passed the exam, but not becuase of this book. This book would fail you, for sure. I read Thomas Lee's TCP/IP and the Syngress TCP/IP troubleshooting book, and those put me over the top.This book is really sad. I hope they recall it and write a good one soon."
1,Did not work at all,Received this toner cartridge & it would not work at all. Made a grinding noise and sounded like it would break my copier.
3,"Fragile, frustrating prep bowl","This is a terrific food processor except for the work bowl. The locking trigger jams and eventually breaks, and it's difficult to find a replacement (DON""T order a bowl listed as simply a DLC 2014 bowl -- despite what vendors say, it won't match the lid.). Cuisinart has known about this problem for years, but hasn't addressed it. I notice Amazon and other places have it at a deep discount -- maybe Cuisinart is addressing the issue by discontinuing it."
5,Love my PowerPrep!,"I was skeptical about the new 'look' of this processor (I love the classic lines of the boxier old model) but the easy to clean lines and touch-pad are wonderful. Plenty of power, heavy duty blades, large capacity etc - really a work-horse!"
3,E-format really stinks,"I am reading this book right now, and I like the story and the characters. What gets on my nerves, however, are the endless typo's, misspelled words, and hyphenated words. Can't you do better than this???"
1,Scrooged again!,"This is more of a warning than a true review. This movie is the same as the one that Amazon pairs it withScroogein their recommendation to buy this with another related object. Unless you want this for the bonus material, if you already have another version of the Seymour Hicks' ""Scrooge"" stay away from this. This film is also listed on another page as Starring Oscar AsheScrooge.Just for the benefit of those considering this - Oscar Ashe (listed as the main actor on the top of the page) plays the Spirit of Christmas Present in this movie."
5,i love ashley &jaquavis,this book was so good i read it within one hour. i just love them as a duo author. keep doin ya thing!!!
5,Can't Get Enough!!,"I don't care what book it is of theirs, I can't get enough of Ashley and JaQuavis. As a duo or independently!!DIRTY MONEY was the book that set it off for them and this is my second time reading it. My girl Anari has been through the fire and back again. When we first meet Anari, she is somewhat of a timid young lady with a rough home life. As the book progresses we watch this, for lack of a better phrase, ugly duckling shed her fears and insecurities and become a boss bitch in her own right!I love the way this story played out! I have read almost all of A&J;'s titles and have yet to be truly disappointed. Their characters blend well author each other and the plot has plenty of twists and turns to keep readers on the edge of their seats!"
5,Damn Good Book,"If I could give this book ten stars I would. I think BET should start recognizing the African American authors because if they did Ashley and Jaquavis would definitely get some type of award. This book was GOOD! GOOD! GOOD! It took me through so many circles, I was dizzy at the end. The way it ended was the best, these authors definitely took it to another level. Anari was a straight up G. She didnt take no mess from nobody and you watched her grow throughout the book. I was tripping when I found out it was two authors too. That's why it was so good. It's one of a kind!"
5,Cohen book,"The condition of the used book was just as described, shipping was quick. I am very happy with the purchase!"
4,A delightful story,"The Sheperd's Voice is a Christian romance following Gabe Talmadge and Akira Macauly. Gabe is a man with a troubled past and son of the ruthless and powerful Hudson Talmadge. Gabe returns to the town of Ransom after serving 10 years in prison for the ""murder"" of his brother, he is looking for work during the depression. His father, Hud Talmadge, refuses him help in ""his"" town and kicks him out. Gabe collapses on the side of the road where he is found by Akira, a sheep rancher, who takes in this broken man to work on her ranch.Akira's strong Christian faith guides her on a path of spiritual and personal growth as she and Gabe work side by side on the ranch. Gabe struggles with his past and slowly rekindles his faith in God. Meanwhile Hud plots revenge against his son and Akira, vowing to own the land the ranch stands on.This was my first Robin Lee Hatcher book and I will read more. It was a fast read and good to the last page. It reinforced trusting God completley in my life."
4,An enlightening glance at a disappearing lifestyle,"Even though seemingly made on a low budget-all segments pretty much filmed on the same ranch-the film was interesting and nicely paced. It provided a good glimpse into the disappearing life-style of the American Cowboy, the ethics and the mentality as well as the challenges, the ups and downs these hard-working individuals face. Beautiful photography helped. Inspired me to buy the book 'Cowboy Ethics'."
4,my first food processor,Was excited about my first food processor. Had to return a part because it was packed so tightly that I couldn't get the pieces apart. Interesting process through Conair (which evidently makes Cuisinart products. Processor works fine and I'm still learning how to use it correctly. Easy to understand directions and great recipes come with the item.
5,I am in love,Bought this for my wife and she thanks me everytime shen uses it. Great product. Would buy this again for sure
2,"Re: Food Pusher Stuck ""Solution""","After spending an hour trying to remove the food pusher which was packed with plastic and impossible to remove we called Cuisinart. Wrong ! The guy, Adam, was a moron.... Enough said.Solution: I placed the styrofoam packing piece that the Pusher Assy (#4) came in on a solid surface. I then turned the Pusher Assy upside down and placed it in the styrofoam piece cut out. (perfect fit) I placed a used roll of electrical tape on top of the small pusher (about the same diameter)for protection and then placed a putty knife on top of the tape to create a solid surface. Two not so hard hits with a hammer and the small pusher fell out into the styrofoam packing.No oil or hot water etc...........Hope this helps you.... :o)PS: No serial #... What's up with that Amazon ?"
4,This is a great machine!,"This food processor does it all, and it does it fast. Clean up is ultra-easy, as all the parts are dishwasher safe. Missed 5 stars because the safety mechanism seems awkward when working with it, and the bowl doesn't seem to hold as much as the box claims. A new feature is the bread blade and bread button. I have tried this and it does a pretty good job of kneading. I have not had to contact customer service, which seems to be a common complaint with other users."
5,Much Cheaper than Other Dept. Store,"My sister in law was registered at Macy's and I found this identical item on Amazon for $50 Cheaper! It is identical. Plus I got free shipping and it was at my house very quickly. I loved how easy this was and it's a Cuisinart, so I'm sure it's a great product...not to mention it came with a 3 year warranty!"
1,aweful customer service,"I received a Cusinart food processor as house warming gift. (It is a different model.) It broke down at the very first time I used it. I paid shipping and sent it back for repair. Then I got a letter that asked me to pay for the repair. I called multiple times and they said that it was not under warranty. Two out of three customer service representatives were very rude. They insisted that customers should pay as far as it is not under warranty ""regardless if it broke down at the first time or on the first day"". That tells you they have no commitment to their product quality and how relentlessly they treat their customers. I would never buy another Cusinart product and return any Cusinart gift. Or I will just tell friends never to give me a Cusinart product."
1,food processor,I was charged shipping although ad said shipped free.It weighs a tonMuch more complicated and harder to use than any food processor I ever owned; will probably end up giving it to some worthy cause. Yuk!!!!
5,Amazing Food Processor,This food processor is absolutely amazing. It handles everything I put in it. It's easy to use and even easier to clean! I love that it is all dishwasher safe and the instructional dvd is great too.
4,Like it!,"The few times I used it, I liked it! It has style, power and does everything quickly. (my old processor was a wedding gift over 30 years old) It's a good size for our household. I orginally got a 7 cup for Mother's day from a local department store, and thought the capacity too small. I checked Amazon and found this one for less cost than the 7 cup which was on SALE at the department store. It was a ""no-brainer"" and returned the department store 7 cup Cuisinart and ordered the Amazon 9 cup Cuisinart at less cost, and no shipping charge. I liked that too!"
5,I love it and my kitchen does too,Don'tknow what I would have done with out this machine I love it I make all my son's babyfood in it and I am sure I will find more to do with it!
5,"WOW, I love this processor!","I got this processor to make some recipes that I've been coming across in some Paleo cookbooks and this one works great. It's easy to use almost no food gets ""hung up"" and unchopped. Great for slicing items for stir fry, even mushrooms."
5,My new food processor,"Compared to the food processor I had, the Cuisinart is excellent, easy to use and as good as any I would wish for."
1,Don't buy this machine,"I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day, It worked fine for 7 months. Today, she turned it on and nothing happened. This machine is not used on a daily basis, and used mainly to chop nuts. I called Cuisinart, I was told it was still under warranty, but I need to send it back, my own expense, and enclose a $10 check for shipping and handling so they could send it back to me. For the price I could have gone to Wal Mart and bought a $20 machine, which probably would have lasted longer and would not be as upsetting, compared to $149. My advice choose another brand."
2,Can't Get the Stupid Container off of the Unit!!!!!,I HATE this food processor! I have had it for several years now and rarely use it because it is so hard to get the container off of the unit. I have to beat it and stand on my head and do acrobatics and pray that the stupid thing will come off without spilling my food. Other than that it works fine. But it is just too annoying to use and I am going to replace it with a less annoying and hopefully easier to work unit. If you want to purchase this unit...take mine for free!
2,broken and returning it,"I was excited with the purchase. Used it to shred cheese and carrots and it worked great. Next day it just stopped working, I couldn't figure out what happened..the manual has no troubleshooting tips.I tried all I could do..wrote to cuisinart customer care but no one responded.I'm kind of disappointed with the customer care. Product itself seems to have all the feature that I need but I will be returning it and maybe opt for kitchen aid."
5,Extremely Pleased,"When I was ready to buy, I researched food processors until I had a headache. Everything I was reading kept bringing me back to the Cuisinart, but I really hesitated when I saw the 3 or so customer reviews about the locking mechanisms being tricky or difficult to work. I've never owned a food processor so I was very worried that a novice trying to work a sophisticated machine like the Cuisinart would put me in the same boat as those unhappy reviewers. I needn't have worried at all, however, for when my beautiful machine arrived I watched the included dvd tutorial and was able to work the processor like a pro in no time. I made chili in half the time it would have taken me to hand chop all the veggies.The machine is easy to put together, easy to take apart, super easy to clean, and works like a dream. Have heart! Even a first timer can work the Cuisniart Prep 9 with ease!"
2,"Low quality, looks very cheap","I bought 2 of them- one for me and another for my fiancee. It looked pretty good deal. When the product arrived, I was so dissapointed that I decided to return them immediately. The looks and feel is very cheap. The sleeves doesn't seem to be of nice quality. It feels like they may get torn or come out of its place any time. I then looked for case logic made of Koshin. They are pretty good. Another good one is slappa. They have hard case like structure. I got them at pretty low price at Buy.com.You may also find good ones at Meritline.com with coupons and stuff. I love amazon. They took it back without any fuss.I wouldn't recommend this item."
2,Too costly for the quality,I got this product for about $14. Later on I got a similar wallet for just $6 and the worst part was that it was of a better quality.
3,Bogus mail-in rebate vendor,"The mail in rebate forms for all products from Velocity indicate that the ""Request must be postmarked within 15 days after purchased."" (sic), but the products usually ship 15 days after the order is placed!Don't buy from Velocity unless you're willing to pay full price."
5,Just to answer your question...,"Lee and Craig did a rare thing and teamed up on both disks. Unlike the unsaul arangement of one mixing the first disk, and the other doing the chore on the second, they mixed each disk together working on track selection and final mixing/mastering."
2,Twee,"I bought this on the strength of the material that is on the ""Songs of Jack Hardy"" by mostly women singers. I goofed. The estimable ""Tinker's Coin"" is here but the rest of the material is saccharine. All that's missing is the knit aran and a cap and the smell of turf. I am frankly, disappointed. Hardy and his musicians are competent enough, but given the wealth of material on the other record, I was a little stunned at how touristy this is. He isn't up to Gaelic on one of the songs, so he comes off a bit like The Clancys, minus Tommy Makem and two brothers. Fine enough for your granny, but not the genuine article, by a long shot. Instead of the tinker's coin, it's more counterfiet confection. Skip this."
3,good product but overpriced,I purchased this product & the next day saw the same item at Wal-Mart for $3 cheaper.
5,nice review,This is a good overview of foreign service life for anyone interested in taking the foreign service exam. ................. .....
3,"Interesting, but just okay","I'm studying for the FSOT and while I found this book on Amazon, it's also recommended by the State Dept. The collection of stories is interesting, but many are the same - talking about what it's like to be an officer with a spouse or family. I'm single and there are no stories to address that. A little more diversity would help to give a more realistic picture. Nonetheless, most of the stories are interesting and it's nice to shed some light on a hush-hush job."
4,"Couldn't You Stay Flat, Stanley?","I'm a young reader from Korea, and I liked this book a lot.First, it was fun, but he returned to be rounded again. If he didn't become round, it sould be more fun. If he stayed flat, there would be more adventures. Then he would become more famous.Anyway, I really enjoyed the book, especially, I loved it when Stanely flew in the air like a kite."
3,Flat stanely,"One of my favorite books is Flat Stanley. It's about a boy named Stnaley, he's so flat that he can slip under doors.and air shafts. Some of the boys at school became jealous. His brother tried to make him self flat by putting books on him and it didn't work. Stanely is so flat that he cam turn into a kite. He can mail himself in an envelope."
4,Exciting adventures for primary/early-elementary readers.,"Reading this book to my second grade students, I experienced something very new--high interest and attention of my class,even though the llustrations in this chapter book are black & white. The children listened to the story carefully as Stanley waited on the portrait's frame for the robbers, and they laughed out loud as Stanley became tangled in the tree when his brother forgot about the new ""kite."" This story was fun for the students thhear, and it was fun for me to read."
1,Disappointment,I have never received product. Very disappointing. Sent requests and notifications to both Amazon.com and to provider of book for delivery information-neither responded.
5,"An important, general title tackling a host of deployment issues families across the country face","Military families facing the uncertainties of war now have something to turn to for guidance in Karen Pavlicin's Surviving Deployment: A Guide For Military Families. Learn how to stay together as a family, how to adjust to long absences and uncertain communications, how to overcome the challenges of single-family parenting and new responsibilities, and how to manage financially through a blend of personal stores from hundreds of fellow military families and checklists. An important, general title tackling a host of deployment issues families across the country face."
3,Listen and Learn,"Quite frankly, this is a good resource for a military family who is not on a base or post, such as a National Guard or Reservist family. However, for one with ties to a military community, the same information is easily accessible by talking with friends and neighbors and listening and being willing to learn from them."
2,Decent,This book is written in a similar style to Dickens's works. The author was one of Dickens's children. Classic-lovers will love it but people who are not into that style will generally not prefer it.
1,poor,"I found this book dissapointing. The current price of $120 is absurd. As one of the reviewers put it, what is in the book would be confusing to someone untrained in engineering, and useless to an engineer. Principles of Yacht Design by Larsson and Eliason provides a useful, concise review of sailboat design, and is much cheaper. As a naval architect and sailor, don't waste your money. If you're looking for a concise background with some practical, useable info, get the Larsson-Eliason book. If you want more theoretical info, then you need to go to engineering school."
2,Scroll Pattern Book,I was very disappointed in this book. I did not like most of the patterns this book had to offer. Most of the patterns were of items that I would never use. You can get the same kind of patterns from a child's coloring book. I will be sending this book back.
5,"Wonderful movie. It was a gift for my mom. She loved it, too!","I saw this movie on television and knew that I had to purchase it for my mother. She grew up with her mom, my grandmother, singing ""Silent Night"" in German. There is a beautiful version of this song in the movie. The song, along with the very positive message of the movie is very worthwhile."
5,great for sensitive skin,"After reading about how a&d ointment and neosporin can pull your color out I started checking thia brand out. I read up on their website, talked to my tat artist and other people with tattoos. The Goo in the tin is thicker and gets stuck to clothing easier. The lotion is thinner and dries quickly. It's lighter so you don't have to rub so hard to spread it out. I like how it doesn't feel sticky and a tube only cost five bucks at the tat shop. Plus if my artist uses it himself why shouldn't i?"
2,GEORGIA RULE,"MOST FRUSTRATING TO WATCH. IT'S JUST NOT MY KIND OF MOVIE. I WATCHED IT ONCE. BECAME IRRITATED BY MOTHER , DAUGHTER AND GRANDMOTHER."
2,JUNK!!,I strongly advise you not to watch this movie because it is junk!!do i need to say more....DO NOT WATCH IT! IT IS A WASTE OF UR TIME!!
4,Great Movie,"I know everyone loves to hate on Lindsay Lohan and Jane Fonda but I personally like them. So if you like them, you will like the movie. I thought it was a good movie. Would I spend over 10 dollars on it? probably not because I don't like to spend a lot on movies. But I do want to own it. I will watch it more than once in awhile. It will be a good purchase."
4,grrreat movie!!,this is such a great movie..i dont know why it didnt do to well in the box office..you have to get this movie its worth it plus more!!!
5,infinitely inspiring & informative,"The exploratory metaphor of this book, fleshed out in word, illustration, and icon is so appealing! It invites me to adventure into the human body as I would travel a hiking path- getting involved with the tissues on my way rather than to observe from an intellectual distance. This is perfect for any of us who adventure into somatic territory. Thorough yet accessible in its information scope, this is my recommended anatomy reference, from first edition to now, in my massage therapy booksPre- and Perinatal Massage Therapy: A Comprehensive Guide to Prenatal, Labor, and Postpartum Practice (LWW Massage Therapy and Bodywork Educational Series)andDeep Tissue Sculpting (2nd Edition)and courses. These resources are gems!"
3,DiaGnosis: Very interesting,"The Celestial Clock, claims that 5,125-year Great Cycle of the Maya Long Count represents a quarter of a ""warming cycle"", which is part of a 23,000-year ""dominant ice volume collapse cycle"", and that every 11,500 and 23,000 years, there is a major polar axis shift, with severe earthquakes and flooding. The earth goes through warming and cooling cycles, which are a result of increased heat and carbon dioxide, but independent from Man. The ""Black Hole"" at the centre of the galaxy exerts a cyclic gravitational pull, resulting in friction between magma and Earth's crust, producing the heat & gas. Religious symbology from Egypt and the Bible are used in support of the theory.Although the book has faults and poor graphics, it is very thought provoking!"
5,The best book on the subject I've seen,"I love this, it's the best book on the subject I've seen. The drawings are more realistic and far less dated than Hogarth's. There are also far more examples, and more detailed at that, than Bridgman. Now if someone would write a book this good on painting clothed figures..."
2,Seemed like a moldy oldie,"I made it through only about 60 pages of this novel before setting it aside in the charity pile. The plot just seemed so dated- Quiller racing against time to keep yet another U.S.-Soviet summit from being derailed. In 1985 this probably seemed like a big deal, but it just doesn't resonate now. Also the first-person narration is strangely detached and antiseptic."
2,Not worth it,"This product was not worth purchasing. The pictures to not come out very clear because it is a low gloss grade paper, if you want good pictures spend a little more, it's well worth it in one run. Otherwise this is pretty much just good for school presentations where photo quality is not that big of a concern."
4,Works for my purposes,"The paper is a cross between regular paper and photo paper, because it's glossy like a photo, but thin like a piece of paper.I like it good for scrapbooking, because it doesn't matter how thick the photo is, just that it printed good & I like the little bit of gloss.Plus it was a good price for all the photos that I print out for me & my kids to scrapbook."
4,Good paper,"Great bargain considering the price was so low. You'll pay double the cost at leading office stores like Office Depot. Takes good quality photos, the paper is somewhat thin;you still get that brilliance that you expect from glossy paper through."
3,Low gloss,"This paper is definitely a low gloss. It prints nicely but if you're looking for a high gloss, this paper isn't it."
2,"Decent photo paper, but thin","The quality is decent on the paper, but it is very thin. It is not bad, if you are careful in handling it."
1,terrible quality!,"what a waste of money! i just bought this for the 8x10 photos i wanted to print but the paper is so aweful. It is so dull. Canon photo plus glossy II is just like a photo from a store would be printed on, but this is so dull and darkens the photo too. I wish i didnt waste my money on this product. No way would i ever give it more than 1 star!"
4,Kodak Glossy Photo Paper,I buy lots of photo paper and print lots of photos. This is a good quality paper at a reasonable price.
5,very happy with this purchase!,I LOVE this product. It cuts my prep time in half and really expands the type of things I can cook in a pinch. I made creamy pesto sauce in about 3mins a few nights ago and this product did all the work. I would highly recomend it to anyone.
3,It works well but not great.,"This works really good for pureeing food or for chopping into really small pieces but not that great at chopping into bigger chunks. It is nice because I don't have to use my bigger food processor for everything but it doesn't hold a lot and you have to be careful not to over pulse. If someone was looking for a small food processor, I probably wouldn't recommend this one."
5,Great and Compact!,"This food processor works really great, small but powerful, it only takes very small space. It's very easy to clean, I just love it! It makes cooking so much easier"
2,Just too small,"I thought I would use this and do small batches but it's just so dinky. If you don't plan on making anything but salsa, it might work for you."
5,best processor!,"First off, Cuisinart makes some of the best appliances ever, and now with so many different colors to chose from, OH MY GOSH!"
5,Great Little Grinder,I bought this mini grinder for my daughter and son in law. I already had one. It works perfect for small jobs and cleans up easily. I grind canned fruit for baby food and fresh garlic to put in jars to use when needed. Love this product.
2,"Worked okay for a couple of months, then slowly fell apart","Not durable, I'm afraid. I was using it about once a week, and it started leaking after a couple of months and then the ""lock-in"" tab snapped off the lid."
4,Handy little processor!,"I make baby food with this processor. I originally bought it thinking it would be the perfect size for the little batches I make... and it is. The size is great. Not too big and not too small. It purees everything perfectly and quickly, plus it looks nice on my counter without taking up a ton of space. The only drawbacks are that it's loud. VERY loud. I have to make sure the baby is completely asleep on the other end of the house with his door closed in order to start pureeing and even then it sometimes wakes him up. Also the motor tends to smell. I worry that with contiued use it will burn out. I've only had the processor for a couple months so if it breaks I'll be writing a follow up review!"
1,A piece of junk,"I purchased this item on Amazon two years ago and am now back on Amazon to find a replacment mini food processor. My husband and I have used this machine an average of one to two times a month over these two years and I would say that we have never had a month where we used it more than twice. After a maximum of 50 uses, this machine just died. It will not work at all and we have unfortunately passed the 1-1/2 year warranty. What a cheap piece of junk and certainly not what I expected from a Cuisinart product."
4,He loves it.,it was purchased as a gift. the recipient is very happy and expressed great satifaction after using it just one time.
2,Too light duty,Gears are made of cheap plastic and will strip if anything too hard like patatos or hard cheese is ground! I took it apart and it is toast!
4,my mighty helper,"THis was purchased to replace the older model 6 years old. I use it mostly for chopping nuts to making salad dressings, anything small to not have to take the big one out. I love the new features and it is stronger and faster. However When trying to shred cheese the processor was not strong enough to do it."
2,Cuisinart Mini-prep plus food processor/ Highly disappointed.,"I bought this mini processor for the specific reason of making salad dressings or vinaigrettes for all my pasta dishes; worked perfect first two times I used it; today I used it for the 3rd time and the liquid was just spitting out from the lid seal all around the bowl and top. What is the purpose of using this item if it spills from the lid seal (trust me, I kept removing lid and checking to make sure it was attached correctly and i had indeed placed lid and locked it where it is suppose to be)...I had to hold down the lid with pressure today just to finish up what I started and the mess it made...OH Goodness! Good luck with yours if you purchase one!"
4,Good Mini - Cheap Exterior,"I bought this mini food processor, as I wanted a small mini that I could leave on the counter to match my other stainless/chrome/silver and black Cuisinart products. This mini works fine; however, I am very disappointed that the alleged chrome finish is actually cheap plastic and looks like it is cheap plastic. I would have preferred to have paid a little more and had a nice looking unit too."
3,Okay,This works great for very small recipes. It does it's job but doesn't have a whole lot of power behind it due to the fact that it is only 3 cups to process.
5,Well made -great worker,"This is a great addition to the full size Cuisinart - or for small households as ours has become. The design of this food processor is great: easy to assemble and the cutting blade fits into a tube so when you take out the blade, your food is still completely in the bowl. It processes quickly - 2 seconds for deviled eggs. Easy to clean or use the top rack of a dishwasher. Couldn't ask for more."
4,The Mini Prep Plus Cuisinart,"This is an amazing little machine, easy to assemble, easy to operate. The instructions are very specific and clear. I live alone and seldom cook for more than 2 people, so it's ideal for me. For anyone who regularly cooks for a family, though, is might prove too small and limited in function. (It doesn't puree, for example;I have a blender, though, so this doesn't matter). I highly recommend it as a no-nonsense machine for small jobs. (I ordered it from Amazon; it came within 4 days.)"
4,No more tears,"I recently received the mini-prep plus as a wedding shower gift. So, far, it has been used almost every day since we returned from the honeymoon. Cutting onions has never been so easy. No more tears when chopping onions.I've used it to make chicken salad a few times and it blends very nicely. If I put too much in it, though, it tends to cream the bottom (by the blade) and the top stays chunky. I have to continually stop and mix it up.I've chopped onions, celery, carrots, chicken salad, cookies, and a lot more. It is one of the most useful appliances I have in the kitchen. It is easy to clean--I'm not sure I should have, but I throw it in the dishwasher, but even when I don't, it is easy--I usually just rinse it out with a little soap and water."
5,Excellent addition to my kitchen!,"After reading in Julia Child's ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" that she believes every chef should have a food processor, and after having a failed experience with the chopper attachment on my Cuisinart Hand Blender, I picked up this 4-cup mini prep so I could make some hummus and pesto. I have to say that I am very impressed with it so far! To test it, I tossed some pearl onions into it and pulsed the ""chop"" feature a couple of times. It seems quite powerful and in just a couple of seconds, I had chopped pearl onions. It is easy to disassemble and wash, and simple to operate. Great value!"
1,"Okay, Until it Overheated","Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Prep Plus Food Processor, Brushed ChromeThis mini-processor performed well for some things (pesto, silken tofu), except that it is very light-weight plastic and must be firmly gripped and held down while it processes. Also, it has no overheat-thermostat switch to shut off automatically before the motor burns up. I had processed some almonds, then was batch-processing some dates that were dry and pre-cut into bits. I was pulsing as is recommended, when I felt the processor getting very warm. I shut it off and let it completely cool. When I tried to process again, the motor was dead. It was only a couple of months old and the eleventh time I used it. Obviously a disappointment."
1,Totally useless,"I bought this thinking it would be a nice little chopper for herbs, garlic or parmesan cheese. It fails miserably. The only thing it chops well is air. The blade spins nice and fast until you put anything in and then it comes to a grinding halt. The only thing I've managed to chop with it is a few sprigs of parsley. Apparently, the motor is so weak that it can only handle the lightest task. It's a complete waste of money and I don't recommend it at all."
2,Cuisinart has terrible customer service,"I purchased this product and after only a few months the plastic bowls developed a long crack, causing liquids to leak out. The unit continued to operate, although it was very messy. A week ago, the top cover piece that latches and locks into place (also made of plastic), snapped apart - making the until unusable. I contacted Cuisinart's customer service through email. I explained that I was a loyal Cuisinart customer and asked for a replacement bowl and lid. I explained that the rest of the unit was in working order. Customer service replied telling me that I could replace the bowl for 17.00 and lid for 8.99, plus taxes and shipping and handling! I replied that I would not be purchasing another Cuisinart product. From now on, I'll purchase from the lesser known companies for 1/3 to 1/2 the price. If the item only last a year, I'm no worse off than buying from Cuisinart."
4,Best Processor for the Price.,"I have been using this processor almost daily for about 1 month and I am very pleased. I have used it to make nut butters, mix desserts like fudge, and chop veggies. It is a small cup size, but works well if you are making a meal for a family of 4 or less."
2,Just doesn't cut it.,"This machine does not measure up to my expectations of a Cuisinart product. I expected to do the same job as a larger processor, just do it in a smaller way. It didn't work that way.It clogs up too easily no matter how small an amount you put in."
5,great little processor,"I bought this processor to make baby food, but I find that I use it almost every day in my dinner prep. Easy to use and sturdy. It seems to only chop big pieces or very fine pieces, so if you want something in between then this might not be the best product to use. I have used this several times and only once did I not get the consistency I wanted. I like to use it to make small amounts of salsa or similar recipes."
4,A fun read,"Leon Crump's Drive for Show Putt for Dough was a truly enjoyable read. This book lets every golfer see what it is like to be the best golf hustler ever born. As with most memoirs the writing style wouldn't knock the socks off your high school english teacher, but, unlike most memoirs, they isn't a boring page in the whole book. Definately a recommended book to buy."
4,Gifts for husband,My husband is really enjoying this book. A very good read for the avid golfer. Very humorous and well written.
4,"For moms and dads and kids, alike",I actually gave this book to my mother who enjoyed it as much as I did. We found it a valuable illustration of relationships to be learned from and entertained by...
1,me fallo,"no se que paso pero el color amarillo no me funciona,no se si era que esta defectuso el cartucho,ya que no me imprime en amarillo"
2,Print Head Don't replace,Purchased new print heads since HP print out stated that they were worn out.Put in the new ones and they worked for one day. Then got constant error message.Could never get them to work after then so went out and purchased a EPSON printerand traded in the old HP for $75 trade in bucks.
3,Under warrenty,"HP had to replace it after a few uses. I got an error message on my printer (a problem with K/Y Printhead) that I couldn't clear off the screen. Called HP and after 1.5 hours of ""troubleshooting"" they agreed to fedex me a new printhead and it works great."
3,works great but HP is just way too overpriced!!!,"I have NO problems with the seller, they were great!BUT, CMON HP, your prices are way too high!I purchased a Canon All in One and may have to say good-bye to HP if they don't shape up!!"
5,Finally ! some answers !,"once again, this is a must read from Dolores Cannon, our society has made ufo and alien subject matter to be of fear based concepts, Dolores gets behind the whole abduction thing, and gets to the real answers, I would suggest reading "" keepers of the garden "" first.If you have an interest in ufo's, the paranormal, spirituality.... Dolores's writing Will bridge the gap and connect all three of these together, that will bend your mind like a pretzel, she is taking UFO research into a whole new level. this is a MUST READ book."
5,Eye-Opener,This Book Is A Eye-Opener About What Implants and The Reason Wat Alien Visitation Is All About.Together With Conveluted Universe A Must Read For People Who Want Answers.
5,It's a page turner,"I couldn't wait to read the next section in this fascinating book. Dolores relays to us the direct testimony of a few contactees. And she herself, while not an experiencer, is delightfully honest and simple. I found the testimony fascinating and very revealing and am anxious to read the sequel, which I've ordered. It seems to me that something really big is happening, and I dare say something wonderful. Books like these are the first signs of a stunning reality that I believe is now gradually unfolding."
5,Dolores Cannon continues to offer food for thought.,"Dolores Cannon continues to offer food for thought whether a believer in alien life forms or not. This provocative book stimulates the mind into considering just what mankind is doing to the planet and what would help to make a difference. With the growing problems of pollution and violence in society, perhaps an alternative source of help is at hand with the coming of the millenium. The Earth is more valuable than realized by most. The reader may be amazed to discover that some of what is discussed could be happening to them without consciously being aware yet not without their permission. I recommend this book to those with an open mindness for possibilities. There is much to learn...perhaps this is an excellent starting point for the future."
5,Real Life,"The most realistic show on TV. All the actors are perfect for their part. My favorite is Crosby, but I love Adam too!"
5,My Fingers are crossed that this will not be the last season,A moving series on all levels. You will grow to love each and every one of the characters! The bravest portrayal of cancer that I have seen in the longest time....this season was truly about love in motion.
4,Ray Romano character a needed bit of grounding,"""Parenthood"" had always been that series that seems to aspire to the 2012 version of the ""Walton's"": just on the edge of a bit too. Idealistic, saccharin, invasive, chummy, etc. Ray Romano's character is a perfect addition to ground this show. He is bitter, without enthusiasm and non-effusive (something I think this histrionic family could hardly understand.) His interaction with Lauren Graham's character is just right counteracting her bustling, busy-body, over-the-top ideas. There seems to be a genuine interaction between the two, she bringing him out of his reclusive existence in a dusty, dis-organized shop and he bringing her into a real craft and patience for the art he creates. There is a dance going on between them and his slow disclosure is keeping the mutual interest going. It's a relief to see this spot of quiet amid the non-stop talking, confessions and intrusiveness of the rest of the family."
4,Not meant to be a comprehensive apologetic,"The negative reviews of this book are apparently expecting it to be a polemic proving the diety of Jesus Christ. Those looking for such material should check out ""The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict"" by the same author or ""The Case for Faith"" or ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel. This book's aim is different, which in no way decreases its value to someone who is openly searching for truth."
2,This book can't give you anything you don't already have.,"In the interest of disclosure, I picked up ""More Than a Carpenter"" after being exhorted to do so by a lady I met on a plane. This isn't my religion, but I was open to learning more about it.I was quite disappointed. I accept that logic and religion typically don't mix well, but McDowell does such a rotten job of it, that I came away from the book feeling like the entire thing was an insult to my intelligence. He grounds his arguments with statements like, ""Nobody questioned Thucydides or Herodotus, so why are they questioning Jesus?"" Possibly because neither Thucydides nor Herodotus proclaimed themselves the son of God.Skip McDowell and pick up someone who didn't write a tract resembling a high school history paper (C.S. Lewis comes to mind). Or, if you like, pick it up and take a good look at the sort of thing you don't want to be the poster child for your beliefs."
5,Josh McDowell proves that Jesus is who he claims,"Once again, Josh McDowell who is the most requested speaker in America (Life Ministries 1997 Report), has made heavy truths understandable to all of us. For anyone after a second opinion on this historical figure known as Jesus - go no further than this easily digested book. And for any Christian with a heart to share their faith, I hope you have a well read copy of this book on your desk, at the ready."
3,Not for me...,"This is an introductory look into the concept of Christianity as an intelligent choice. It may be of benefit to skeptics or those unfamiliar with a personal relationship with JC. It's more milk, than meat."
3,The gospel of Christ presented in a simple way,"More than a Carpenter is a small book that everyone should read. The author is not an expert but does his best to communicate that Jesus lives and that his message is a powerful one. I read it on a plane ride to Texas and loved a lot of the insights that Mr.McDowell included. I also liked the way he presented various scenarios about many key moments in the Gospels. It was a pleasant read and I passed the book on to a female friend while in Texas. Once read, it should be passed on so others can enjoy it as well."
1,FOLLOW-UP REVIEW,"I recently wrote a brief review and have received a number of negative e-mail responses as a result. A complete rebuttal of the arguments in the book is not possible within the limited space provided. In response I would like to recommend two books for anyone with an open mind. They provide a rational analysis of the so called ""evidence."" The first is ""The Case Against Christianity"" by Michael Martin. He evaluates the historicity of Jesus and also discusses illogic Christian dogma like salvation. The second book is ""The Unauthorized Version"" by Robin Lane Fox (both are available from amazon.com). The latter book covers the entire Bible as well as discussing recent archaeological ""discoveries.""As Jesus said, ""You will know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."""
5,Gorey's a scary guy...,"Even the most seemingly innocuous tale becomes bizarre and sinister in his hands, thanks to his macabre, claustrophobic writing style. I don't remember which stories are in which amphigorey specifically, but favourites include The Evil Garden, The Epileptic Bicycle, The Gashleycrumb (sp?) Tinies, and of course the Wuggly Ump. Oh, and the one where the guy invites all his guests up to see his...sofa? And then it ends with him ""turning it on"" and them being locked in the room...shudder. Not for the faint of heart, but brilliant in the extreme. Don't miss it."
3,Alright...,"This game is great. It is perfect in all aspects, save graphics. Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life has good graphics and more crops, but no fun holidays. This has a good variety of crops, several building expansions, you can marry, you can cook (you have to buy cooking utensils first), and the holidays are interactive. There is chicken sumo wrestling, a summer swimming contest, a musical winter festival, and many more. The only thing this game doesn't have is up-to-date graphics. But they aren't bad, just what was available ate the time. Also, it is similar to the HM game for N64, so if you've played that, you might get bored with the same faces (the characters are the same, they just have different jobs and relations). But, I definitely recommend this game if you haven't play HM for N64, and you should try it if you have played the N64 version."
5,One of the most fun and addictive games you can find.,"Harvest Moon:Back to Nature is simply fun,addictive,brilliant,and it is a total masterpiece.It will leave you hooked for years!The controls are great,it has nice music and I like the graphical style.There are tons of things to do or complete in Back to Nature,and it has a great cast of charectors.Simply put,you must own it."
5,11yr. gamer from New York,"This game is very good. I have this Harvest Moon and the one for N64 and I will be getting the new Harvest Moon for PS2. You start the game by inheriting your grandfather's farm and it's rundown. The field has weeds and sticks, stumps and rocks. The challenging part is you only have three years to make the farm look nice and to make the vllagers like you. I like playing this game because I like to plant the seeds an watching the crops grow and getting married. I am an expert video game player. I play all the Final Fantasies, Chrono Trigger, Odd World, The Bouncer, Shadow of Destiny, Bloody Roar 3, all the Crash Bandicoots, Soul Reaver, a lot of sports games, Zelda and a lot more. My favorite game is Final Fantasy 9. I recommend Harvest Moon for young and old players."
2,Uncomfortable,"These were not comfortable at all, the plastic bottoms radiate cold if you are standing on a cold floor. I would not recommend these."
1,Don't buy,"Don't buy these. They aren't worth the tiny price. I'm not returning them, but I'm not thrilled with them. Don't throw your $ away."
5,Wonderful -A must Have!,Well written -History Time Line - to todayTo BAD all Won't read.......Great Learning Tool for our journey through LIFE.
2,Some good points but.....,"As a beginner's book, this is a fine introduction, except.... Mr. Penczak continually uses the term entomology instead of etymology. Entomology is the study of insects! He means to use etymology, which is the study of names and their origins. I find it hard to take him seriously when he doesn't use the correct terminology. I even contacted Llewellyn Publishing about this glaring error and received no communication in return. You would think they would want to fix such a glaring error."
4,The perfect beginners book,"I have been a student of the Craft for about 17 years now and always looks for new books for students, and this book caught my eye. It and the subsequent books in the series really do brings the methods and techniques to the reader. He really knows how to explain the ways of the Witches"
5,A excellent study tool!,I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to hone their skills it is much better than Silver Raven Wolf (not that there's any thing wrong with her books) but Mr.Penczak has more information on what you may want to work on within yourself.
4,a good value,"Overall, this is a satisfying tool to use for the small jobs and it is a good value. The ergonomics are good: it is well balanced; the grip is comfortable; and the torque, with variable speed settings, is reliable.The lock release for the battery is not real smooth however; it takes a real squeeze to get it off for a charge. The charge might last 10 minutes of continuous usage; the refresh rate on the charger is around 2 hours.Still, I am quite satisfied with this tool; it has given me 2 years of reliable service so far and is still stepping up to the plate.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"
2,Slamboree 1993,"This is the commerical tape, when I bough it I thought the there would be all the matches. They should of cut the legend's matches. The match that stole the show was (Steamboat and Tom Zenk) Dos Hombres vs. The Hollywood Blondes in a cage match for the WCW Tag Team Titles, Steamboat did an awesome bodypress of the top of cage-5 star match. Vader and Bulldog was a disappointing match as a main eventer. I recommend Slamboree 1994 because it's more bang for your buck!"
4,Nice clamps,I have had no issues with these clamps or the Topeak saddle bag. The clamp does not fit every saddle perfectly (hence 4 stars) and takes some manipulation to get on smaller tri saddles. Overall no issues with performance and it has held up through several triathlons and multiple training rides.
2,NOT SCARY AT ALL,"I took a chance and rented this one. I figured that with 4 individual short films in this thing, at least 1 or 2 of them would be scary. Was I wrong! 4 short films and nothing scary about any of them. I should have known. After all, when was the last time you saw anything good with John Saxon or Henry Gibson in it? Well, don't expect much from this one either. At least not as far as good scary horror moments go.However, if you're looking for lots of nudity, this is definitely worth a look. I think there were topless women in just about every one of the short stories. The puzzler though is: when did directors start thinking that topless women make for a good scary movie? Entertaining to watch, maybe. But scary? I don't think so.Save your time. Save your money. Check out something else instead of this lemon. I'm sorry I wasted MY time, that's for sure!"
4,"""You're not going to cut it off!""","Okay, you might cut it off, but there are some catchy segments in this horror movie/almost cliche'/anthology. I really enjoyed the first segment by Ken Russell. Funny, gory, sexy all rolled into one, or two. The second segment by Sean Cunningham is pretty eerie, if not exactly terrifying and has an eye-catching bit of morphing art/manga/animation. It was interesting. Monte Hellman's, Stanley's Girlfriend did nothing for me. waaa-wa. The last segment, by John Gaeta, was a nifty twist on twin-ship, which I liked. The framing story done by Joe Dante was cliched and silly but it did provide bookends for the anthology.Overall, the comic qualities of the first story and the art of the second one make this a multi-watch keeper. This movie also has enough sex and gore to keep one on his or her toes during a lonely winter's night."
4,Very Helpful,"For writers who are serious about getting published, this book is extremely helpful. It covers everything from the emotional side of being a writer, to the nuts and bolts of submitting a manuscript. Primarily geared towards novelists and writers of memoir, it's also helpful to anyone who takes the art and craft of writing seriously and wants to learn from two successful writers who generously and warmly share their secrets with others."
4,Not really a gift pack.,"I purchased this ""gift pack"" for my cousin as a Christmas gift. He loves hot sauces and I thought this would be the perfect ""usable"" gift. While he was very happy with the sauces (before even tasting them), I was disappointed at the fact that this item was listed as a ""gift pack."" When I think of a ""gift pack"" I think of something that is nicely boxed or packaged. What I received was a shipping box with 6 bottles of hot sauce, each individually wrapped in packing paper to avoid damage during shipping. They're fine - don't get me wrong - but not very presentable as a ""gift."""
4,Nice gift,I sent this to my brother for his birtday. He loves hot sauce and is always trying different brands. He said he liked it and that had some that he'd never tried before. Shipping was extremely fast.
5,A brilliant little wonder of an album,"An amazing, sprawling album, finally released in the US. Magical and exciting yet rustic and homely, and ultimately brilliant. Be sure to buy this, put on the headphones and get yourself a hot chocolate!"
3,Disappointed,"The manual/book was advertised as the 12th edition. Unfortunately, it was the 10th edition............"
4,Automatic Wine Opener,"I was given this item and liked it so much I have given 4 to others. It removes corks like a dream, but even better is the way in which the cork is effortlessly removed from the opener."
3,Can't handle plastic corks,Love love it but plastic corks are more than it can handle. Keep it to cork and I would give it 4 stars. It is a bit noisy.
1,Great when it works,"I bought this item with high hopes based on the positive reviews. When it works it is great but there is a problem. It says it does 30 bottles on a single charge but not so. I charge it all night and it does about one bottle (maybe) and then the battery goes dead. Right now it is stuck with a cork on it and the battery is so dead I cannot get the cork off. I had to use a knife to cut the cork off to even put it on the charger. I should have returned it right away, since it has done this from the start. Maybe I got a 'lemon', I don't know, but I am not a happy camper at this point. Right now to use it I have to charge it every time and maybe if I am lucky get one bttole out of it."
4,oster wine-bottle opener,"My husband couldn't open a bottle of wine without blaming the corkscrew, (i on the other hand, had no problem with the corkscrew). I decided to get this wine opener, it works great, even he can use it with no problem (after the first time). I recommend this for the challenged wine-bottle-opener. It's sleek and dosen't take up much space and it's ready to go all the time. this is an excellent gift for a wine drinker, or for someone with dexterity problems. The price is right too. We have only had it since Christmas, so it gets 4 stars until i see how long it lasts and how it holds up."
5,Best thing since sliced bread,"If you've ever fought with a cork, this wine bottle opener is a MUST HAVE. Remove the foil with the cutter (supplied), position the bottom of the opener on top of the cork and press the down arrow on the front. Keep a slight upward pressure on the opener and ""viola"" -- the cork is out of the bottle. To remove the cork from the opener, press the up arrow until the cork falls out. I give the instructions because it didn't come with any and it took me a while to figure out how easy this was. I wouldn't be without it. It was a present, but I've bought one for a friend and she loves it also."
4,good buy,I bought this for my 78 year old Mother. She like it alot and finds it is easy to use. I am going to get one for myself.
1,Piece of Junk,The only thing this opener managed to do was to shred the cork and remove it half way after four attempts.
5,Best product EVER.,"Received the product very fast and in perfect shape. The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations. I would definitely order this again and I'm glad I read all the reviews first. In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.There is not a single flaw! works perfectly everytime and only requires a charge ever 50 bottles or so."
1,Does not work,I purchased item about a month ago and was successful in removing 3 wine bottle corks (synthetic and not) before it stopped working. I'm surprised other reviewers didn't have the same problem. I would not recommend.
1,wish I had returned this item,"Wish I had returned the item within the time frame. It is useless, does not work and wish I had never bought them, gave one as a gift and that one does not open the wine either. Will never purchase an Oster product again."
1,worked one time,After contacting manufacture sent me a new one and had same problem. Not enough power to work.. Consumer Report recommended as the best electric wine opener after there vigorous testing the wine gave it rave reviews. Not the first time C.R. gave a excellent review on pure junk.
4,"Very Effective Wine Opener, Just Be Careful","This is a very effective wine opener, I bought it after tiring of replacing my Rabbit style manual openers, which consistently wear out and lock up.With this wine opener, it is too easy to open a bottle! You do have practice a bit making sure that you center the opener over the cork, or you will find that you end up slicing it.Also like the handy foil cutter. And its a neat party trick."
4,"Handy, except...","This is a very handy device, especially for someone with limited hand/wrist strength and mobility. If the cork will fit into the well, the unit will power it out. I used it twenty-five times or so before it slowed down perceptibly. Getting the cork off the screw is another matter though; almost every rubber type artificial cork I've pulled required some digging about to get the cork to not turn with the screw in reverse. That's why I gave this unit only 4 stars."
5,Why did I wait so long??,"This thing is great. I drink wine at least three times a week and this is a lifesaver!! I cannot believe I didnt have this five years ago! It is so easy to use. Just takes a couple times to get used to it. The few reviews that said it broke must have just gotten a lemon. This was the second one I purchased as a gift for my sister and she loves it just as much. Can't speak to how long it lasts on a charge since mine is always on the charger. For the price, which is less than most regular non battery operated corkscrews... you can't beat the value!! Order it now!!"
3,Worked well for 10 months,I really liked this wine opener while it worked. It quit after 10 months. The foil cutter was in a nice handy spot and the whole thing was neat looking. There were times when the cork wouldn't come out and we couldn't see what was wrong. So now I am going to try the transparent one.
2,Disappointed,The batttery didn't provide the torque necessary to open a difficult cork. Now will the unit remove the new plastic style corks. The cork screw bent and actually broke off. I switched back to a human powered wine opener and haven't had a problem since!
4,Not too bad,"There is a way to use this gadget. You cannot be sloppy. Hold it vertical ( I mean straight up) and press gently down. When you feel resistance, it is trying to reverse and the cork wants to come out. It is almost artistic the way you get all this done. Believe me it works and I have not used a corksecrew in months. Firm yet gentle that's the key."
2,Not Recommended,"Does not fully remove corks. I have used it over a dozen times and, at best, it lifts the cork about 1/2 way out of the bottle, where it can be removed by hand the rest of the way. Most of the time it only moves the cork about 1/8 to 1/4 inch and I needed to use an old fashioned method. I would not recommend purchase."
4,Awesome,My wife had so many issues with wine bottles and corks. This is our new best friend!!!! its so easy for her to operate. we are drinking more wine then ever. lol.
1,Bad wine opener,"Do not buy this wine opener. It works for a while and then the opener part will not take a charge, I have had 2 of these and the same thing. Both were gifts. I would never by this brand ever. Very badly made. Plus it will not open a plastic cork, so you still need another wine opener, Do not waste your money.If I could have I would have given it no stars!!"
1,Electric Wine Bottle Opener,"I wasn't going to rate this product because I was so unhappy with it, but decided others needed to know that it did not last but six bottles of wine. Worked fine at first and then the whole thing broke. Not happy and would not buy this product again."
4,The best wine opener EVER!,"This is the best, smallest and very cheap wine opener!! We have tried them all!"
2,Oster Review,"We first ordered this product last January. It operated quite well until a couple of months ago, July as I recall, when it failed completely. That, I think, is a very poor track record, 6 or 7 months! Being rather handy with tools, I tried to locate the wiring problem and tracked it down to the circuit board. I could go no further with my quest.Having a wife with minimal hand strength we decided to replace it. I hoped I could find a source for just the bad unit, not the charger or base, but failed.The only reason we reordered was my wife's desire for independence. Except for that, I think this is a poor product given its life expectancy."
1,Do not buy!!,"I mistakenly believed the other reviews that this was a good product for the cost. It barely is capable of opening a bottle of wine, it does not have enough power even after charging it for days. I used it twice before throwing it away. It's a total piece of junk!!"
1,Very Disappointing,"The product was delivered quickly and was well packaged, to be fair. I plugged it in for charging and, after a full day, it still couldn't completely remove a cork from a wine bottle (it made about three revolutions before dying). I plugged it in again for another day and still had no luck with trying to open the wine bottle. I contacted Amazon and they immediately issued a refund and sent me a label for returning the item. I purchased the opener, in part, based on the brand name. Based on the disappointing experience with this particular opener, I wasn't inclined to get a replacement and opted for the refund."
4,Surprise hit!,"OK -- no one needs an electric wine opener. But this thing was a big hit at our annual family gathering at the beach. Probably increased wine consumption, because everybody wanted to be the next to use it. Actually works well -- only problem was one of our still-sober openers forgot to take out the removed cork and we nearly had tears when it appeared not to work when it was next used! I came to the rescue and received applause. And we've ordered four more for presents!"
5,Great gift!,I was given an electric wine opener as a gift and just gave one as a gift!Great inexpensive housewarming gift!Highly recommend.
2,Not ready for prime time,"I purchased this from another source before it was offered on Amazon. While the concept is good, the execution leaves much to be desired. The first problem is that the opener is not powerful enough to reliably remove plastic corks, which are becoming more and more prevalent. Problem two is that the battery/charger combination is obviously old technology with the attendant long charge times and short charge life. Third is that this appliance takes up and inordinant amount of counter real estate given its limited purpose.Try the Screwpull S1115-31 Pocket Corkscrew manual tool. It works as advertised on all corks."
5,wine lovers joy,This is our second one as we wore out the first one after several years. I have also bought 3 as gifts and we all love this opener. Simple to use and I found it even takes out the artificial corks which are more difficult.
2,Broken after two years of light use,"I bought this as a less-expensive, more high-tech alternative to pricey rabbit-style corkscrews. Unfortunately, the product takes longer to fully extract and release each cork than I would have thought, especially compared to a rabbit. It worked fine for the first two years, though, opening just two to four bottles a month. A couple of weeks ago, without warning, it started making a heavy ratcheting sound -- even though I was exerting no more pressure than normal and was pulling a conventional cork (not one of those fool plastic things). This evening, the ratcheting led to a full-blown ""crack!"" -- and that was all she wrote. Would appreciate any suggestions on a replacement."
2,Couple months and not pleased,"Ugh. Loved it at first and then now, it is doesn't work. It won't complete the process to get the cork out. Had to get a hand corker to replace what I thought would be a great product. Oh well. Maybe someone will make a better product."
3,Works well but fragile,Worked well for 6 months (used 2 times a week) and then died. Not sure I would buy again for the price.
2,Not worth it at all!!!,"Before buying this product, I read many reviews about it, and they were almost all 5 stars, so I decided to buy it. Finally I get it!!! I decided to use it that day and it worked perfect. The next day my husband used it and didn't work anymore, just 2 days... This is the second Bottle Opener from Oster that I bought and happened the same thing. I definitely I don't recommend it."
3,No outside package- not good for gifts,"The item itself is okay... kinda cheaply made compared to our Sharper Image version. I bought it intending to give it as a gift, but there is no outside box. It comes in the cardboard shipping box- that's it."
1,Used it about 10 times before battery stopped charging...,"I wouldn't recommend at all. The battery looses its ability to charge, we only used ours about 10 times. What a disappointment!Trashed it!"
1,not long lasting,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon, however I used the item for about a month maybe 4 times a week. After a month it did not work and I threw it out. Went back to my old kitchenaid screw with handles to remove cork. Great idea but like a lot of things in this world not substanial enough"
4,Works great.......,"This product works great after you figure out how to use it! I thought that you had to press the down arrow and then press the up arrow to remove the cork. Well, nope, you actually press the down arrow until it no longer moves, which removes the cork. Then to remove the cork from the opener you press the up arrow. I thought I was just confused but I wasn't the only one. It wasn't until a friend came over and said something! Good product but I think the arrows should be reversed, if that makes sense!"
2,auto wine opener,This product did not work to well after a few uses opening up some wine bottles. The metal screw became lose and it seems like the plastic covering is breaking off each time I try to position it over the cork to turn this product on. Not really worth the money considering it will probably break the next few times I use it.
5,Awesome Oster,"I'm not usually effusive in my reviews but I bought this based on other reviews and was skeptical how good it would be but it's awesome. From the first bottle my girlfriend opened, we were impressed. It's the kind of thing I'll by several more of to take to friends houses who have many kinds of wine at their parties and lots of bottles to open. Even for me, opening one or two bottles a week, it's a joy to have. Certainly not a necessity but absolutely fun."
1,Wine opener,"Great opener. Saves wear and tear. Great value compared to mechanical openers that don't last.This is an update to my previous review. After a few months of use (about 9) the battery apparently died. When I took the unit apart, I found the battery is not easily replaceable and is a special design! So basically, the unit is a throw away when the battery dies. Incredibly poor design. Will NEVER buy another Oster product."
1,Gigantic Disappointment,"Thought for years, I was missing something by not having a Cuisinart! What a laugh. In the few months I have had this unit, two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken. I did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using. This is an obvious design defect. Guess I was lucky, in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything. Now they want the broken item returned, which is an inconvenience and a delay. I was without my replacement last time, at least six weeks. I plan to return this item and purchase a different brand."
2,Two Year shelf life,"When looking for my first food processor I wanted quality. Cuisinart was a name that spoke quality. I guess that is done now. After two years it broke. The motor poured black smoke into my kitchen. Reading the reviews above seem to be saying the same thing. I have sent emails to the company, but after reading the reviews I do not expect to hear from them. I am buying a Kitchenaid."
4,"11 Cup KitchenAid Food Processor, dough blade","I very much have liked this food processor. However, I wanted to knead bread a small amount of dough and used the dough blade. How in the world does this work? All it did was to chop up the dough - didn't work at all. Has anyone had success with this? Perhaps it was because I was using a small amount and it just came to the top of the actual blade. HELP! I really want to use it for this - no good this way.Cuisinart DLC-2011N Prep 11 Plus Food Processor, White"
2,Why I didn't order this model,"After reading the review about customer service problems (and from other ratings sources), I decided to go with the Kitchenaid Professional 11 c. food processor. After all, no matter how good a product is, if the company does not provide good customer service, then it is not worth the money."
2,Read before you purchase!,"Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought. This product is not worth the price! Three shows only; sold by a thrid party. It was a gift so I did not send it back, but certainly fell into the ""P.T. Barnum"" category...one born every minute-that was me with this purchase."
5,I'm Working On It,"The best Western series ever made, certainly in the top 10 of all time shows. Episodes on this DVD: Shady Deal at Sunny Acres (THE best Maverick - Bret, Bart and Samatha Crawford), Gun-Shy (another great) and Pappy.Will more come out? Who knows. Could be that Columbia House still owns the shows. About 10 years ago they released 25 VHS tapes (two shows per tape) on a subscription basis. We can only hope someone will step up to the plate and make more epsiodes available to the public."
2,Only three episodes?,"I love the shows, but a favorites DVD with only three episodes? I couldn't believe it. The three shows would get 5 stars, but the great ones that are missing bring my review down to 2 stars."
5,"Maverick - Classic Western T,V. Series","When I was a kid, I'd watch TV at night with my Dad. Maverick was my favorite. Today my Dad's gone and so are my sons. I had believed Maverick was also only a memory. I'm glad to have my old friend Bret Maverick back and I look forward to resurrection day when my Dad and I can watch it together again. You probably won't publish this review because of its Christian content..... and that's a sad reflection of my country today."
3,no good for older babies,"I ordered this stroller on line, and was dissapointed when it arrived. It's not very sturdy,or very comfortable on your back. I'm only 5ft 2inches, and I had to lean way down. Also, my child is 2, and could wiggle right out of it. I don't recommend this for older babies, and don't really think it's worth it's cost."
5,An essential for frosting and layer cakes,"If you're a baker who frequently makes brownies, bar cookies, and cakes, you need to have an offset stainless-steel icing spatula in your collection. The blade is the ideal combination of strength and flexibility, and using an offset spatula means that you don't end up dragging your knuckles through your frosting as you work around a cake. It's useful for leveling brownie and cake batters to ensure even baking and is a must-have for spreading frosting, particularly on quick-setting sheet cakes like Texas cocoa cake. It's also my tool of choice for spreading fillings and frosting layer cakes. When you're finished, you can either hand-wash or pop it in the dishwasher."
5,Great help in the kitchen!,bought this a while ago because I was tired of icing cakes with a short knife and boy is it way easier. Not only that but it also comes in handy when you need something rigid to run under something to loosen it from it's pan. Definitely suggest this product.
5,Excellent book by a courageous pilot,"The book is filled with accurate information about how the politics at the FAA is once again responsible for unnecessary deaths of innocent, trusting passengers and crew. That is an old, recurring story about that worthless bureaucracy known as the FAA.The one negative review above was obviously written by an ALPA pilot, who hates Fredrick because his book also criticizes ALPA for putting its self-interest political agendas before safety, as it has always done.I am grateful that Stephen Fredrick had the courage to put his concern for safety of the passengers, above the politically correct loyalty, which unions like ALPA demand from their members."
3,GREAT MUSIC AS ALWAYS BUT POOR QUALITY FOR A BLU RAY,"I receive today my order and my expectations are very high.I want to see a new concert of one of my favorite bands but with the magic of the blu ray quality.Fans of Pendragon.....i'm sorry.The concert is very similar to the DVD ""and now everybody to the stage..."" and the picture and sound quality is.......THE SAME!!!!!!The picture is very grainy and the sound denotes a some kind of dinamic compression.This concert is filmed in the same theater of the last DVD's, the Wyspianski Theatre in Katowice, Poland.The set list is very good and perfectly played by this excellent musicians, but if you buy this new blu ray edition don't think to find a different Pendragon show."
3,The blu ray quality is indeed a chaos,"Had high expectations for a BD coming from Pendragon but the end result is a mixed bag: poor video quality for a blu ray, no DTS sound...the setlist and energy coming from the band are great but Concerto Maximo is still the crown jewel in terms of performance."
3,Library Binding is not all it seems,"I have loved Sabatini ever since I read The Sea Hawk in 7th grade. His stories are full of swashbuckling and high adventure. I hadn't read Captain Blood for a while, so I took it out of the library. I remembered how much I loved it, so I went down to the book store to order it in hardback to add to my collection. Imagine my surprise to discover that it may be library binding, but not edition. The book has been edited. Whole scenes cut that sometimes may seem incidental when they occur, but actually contribute in some way to the character development and choices made by the character. I would not advise buying this edition if you are a fan of the book. If you have seen the movie and just want to know what the book was really like, there is enough in there to give the flavor. But I advise all Sabatini fans to avoid it and look for an unabridged copy."
2,Surprisingly bad....,"I was really struck by how bad this book is, not for the writing style, wich is Romantic and enjoyable, but for Captain Blood himself. He is no hero. Weak, self-obsessed and totally inept at leadership. Blood leads his crew into danger based on nothing more than an absurd lust to a boy-faced woman will all the appeal of a stack of bricks. Blood came off as a teenager who had never been kissed. This book was weird..."
1,All I can say is ... What a Queen!,"I mean the title says it all ""2 MUCH DRAMA"". The lyrics suck just like he did last season. Some of you like the beat, but it still aint no TQ ""I WANNA F*CK YO SISTA"" type groove. I say save you money and skip this, maybe you should wait for Bibby or Vlade's album!"
3,Too Much Drama [EXPLICIT LYRICS],GREAT ALBUM FOR A FIRST EFFORT. I se a lot of potential in him. Keep up the positive flow.
1,Might as well use regular printer paper,That will teach me to try to save a few dollars! This paper is really bad. The pictures look like they'd been printed on regular printer paper. And I'm using a Kodak printer as well! Don't waste your money on this. I'm hoping to get a refund from Amazon.
5,"Makita 742108-1 #50 5-Inch Abrasive Disc, 5-Pack","Just what the doctor ordered - ruff cut very durable sanding discs. Remove last 25 years of paint from your fence, wall or floor with this. Careful thou - they are not a joke, very rough yet time saving."
2,"When it works, it's great","We have had this toaster about 2 years and in the last 6 months we can't get the control button to stay down all the time. We have to press on it about 6 times before it sticks. The other problem is once you use it about 3 times in a row the control button doesn't want to go down at all. We have to wait several minutes for it to cool down before we can use it again, by that time our breakfast is cold."
2,Loved the first yr!,I bought this toaster about a year and a half ago and the darn thing just stopped heating in the middle element. So now I have to toast it twice to get it done! Not worth the money! I'll never spend that again for a toaster!
2,'s alright,"My husband and I have had this toaster for 3 years. We purchased it as a wedding gift to ourselves; it was the one thing we didn't get that we really needed. I liked the look and the 4-slice and bagel options. Also, it has the added bonus of the lever's ability to rise just a little higher for those smaller slices of bread. Unfortunately, I wish I would have followed my first instinct and returned this toaster the first week we had it. It toasts unevenly! I was disappointed from the first use. I have to admit, I don't dwell on the fact that this toaster is not perfect, I just toast again if it's too light, start over if it's too dark. Basically, I just wish this thing would toast evenly! The rear slot burns things and the front undertoasts. I have to compliment the machine for lasting three years, though; just because I don't LOVE it we will have it for another ten, I'm sure. Bottom line, when it breaks down, we will not buy another one of this type."
2,Cuisinart 4-SliceToaster,"For the price I expected a better, more even browning. I found it to be no more even than a relatively cheap (about $40) 4-slice toaster it replaced. One side (the interior) of each of the two compartments had weaker heating than the other making one side of the toast much lighter than the other. The two-slice option is nice and the electronic darker/lighter control is convenient."
4,"So Far, So Good!","I've had my toaster for about 3 months now, and have had no problems whatsoever. Although the red light that is on all the time, did cause us some consternation at first, but now I'm used to it's red glow. This toaster cooks bagels beautifully, and I love the large slots. I guess one of my only real gripes about it is that there is no bell or ring that signals when the toast pops up, this would be convenient if you happen to be away from the kitchen when the toast is ready. I love my toaster and it looks beautiful on my kitchen counter."
2,"Ok, not great","not bad for a modern retelling, i guess. modern retellings always lack a certain emotional depth, mostly because the situations and the surroundings of the characters are so familiar. this story is no different. it's an alright book, and the author shows promise, but hopefully her next works will be a little deeper and a lot less dainty when dealing with heavy issues such as death and love"
4,Great krackers,"This is my fist experience with ordering ""groceries"" from Amazon. From May until October or November, we are on an island off the coast of Maine. We go ashore once every five weeks. In the meantime, to learn that I can do a repeat order of something we like was a revelation. The Dr. Kracker is crisp, low carb, and tasty. We do light sandwich type snacks with them. Delivery to the island was prompt."
5,Safe,"Makes it very easy to open a can, and theres no sharp edges on the can or the lid after it's opened."
1,Poor Substitute for Seedlander Flatbread,"It is undoubtedly a matter of taste, but I really wanted to enjoy the Dr. Kracker's Seedlander variety which are absolutely AWESOME (5-STAR)... but they were not availabe...and so the Seeded Spelt were ordered. Big Mistake: The flat taste of these particular flatbreads do not compare with the Seedlander, so the first bite told me I made a mistake in ordering them. But Amazon has been so generous in dealing with other issues, I decided to eat humble pie (crackers) and just quietly finish them up with soups or smothered in Almond Butter. Once and awhile treating myself to a bite of the seedlander bite size crackers product which we also ordered and were available at time of purchase. 5 STARS for AMAZON maybe a one star for the Seeded Spelt. AFTERTHOUGHT: Of course, I run the risk now of not having my favorites available if everyone rushs off to buy them up. Ah...such are the risks of reviews I suppose."
1,Broke within an hour,"The whole harness, ring and ribbon pulled off the dog within the first hour of walking placing my dog in jeapardy."
4,good quality food storage,"We have two sets that we use regularly. The ""see through"" section at the bottom is great for enabling a quick peak at the contents, while still maintaining an opaque container. The lid is also is very sturdy and ""pushes down to snap in to place, making it obvious when it is closed.My only complaint is the sizing. The two largest sizes are very useful for flour, sugar and the like. The smallest size, however, does not seem to get a lot of use in our house. While it would be stackable, it seems to waste cupboard space (and we don't have a lot of use for a container of that size.)"
1,"Worked for two years, then stopped -- no response from customer service","Product worked great for two years, then would not pick up external sensor. Changed all batteries with fresh new ones, but would still not pick up external sensor. Tried all suggestions on company website (ways to install batteries, etc.), but still would not pick up external sensor. Emailed Customer Service and received an automated response that they had received my email, but I have not received a response after three business days.I do not recommend purchasing this product, as the quality appears inferior."
