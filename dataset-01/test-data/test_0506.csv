4,Excellent guide to organize an investment club from scratch!,"The author based this book on the official gude from the National Association of Investors Corporation, which is like the bible to organize investment clubs. But this book adds a lot of practical experience from other investment clubs that the official guide doesn't have. Go ahead and buy it if you are thinkiing of getting a good hold in organizing your investment club."
4,It lasted for three years,"I bought this because it was cheap & battery powered, and it's performed very well, but has now unfortunately died. The reason it probably died is that I keep it in the ashtray & the car's parked outside in all sorts of NE weather. Purchasing another one today. It's been a real value and the sound is very good. Haven't had any problems tuning to empty frequencies even though I live close to NYC."
5,Best Game Ever,This game is so much fun. I play it whenever I get a chance. I have to say that I like it more than the playstation one. I would really give it 10 stars.
2,Meh.,This was not as funny or encouraging as I thought it would be. It was okay but not spectacular.It was short - I guess I wanted to laugh more.
2,may cause mental pauses during read,"From the excerpts and blurps I thought thus was going to be a fun look at what we women go through as we get older. I was mistaken. There were a few things that made me smile; however, it was nothing like I expected."
4,Past Middle Age,"I am past Mentalpause,but found this book funny anyway.Laughter can be the best medicine.Just wait until you are a senior citizen.Instead of hot flashes,you have cataracts,dentures,arthritis and more memory loss.But it BEATS the ALTERNATIVE!"
4,Excellant Portable Fishing....,"This is as simple as it gets, it's not a very involved fishing game, but then again who wants to sit for 20 minutes waiting for a bite on a handheld ? The graphics are excellant, real photo backgrounds and some fantastic rendered fish make the game a real treat for the eyes. Control is simple, maybe a bit too simple, but a great game for an hour of fishing on the couch now and then."
4,Good reference book for beginners,"As a child I was always going to grow up and become a famous archaeologist (I never made it - I am actually a psychologist). My young daughter is similarly interested, and this is a great book for someone ""starting out"" with an interest in ancient times. It looks at all of the famous sites in archaeology, as well as the different eras. In addition it looks at themes as recent as the study of the industrial era, showing that archaeology is not just ancient bones and bits of pottery. For those who want more detail it is probably a little sketchy, but for the average household it is an excellent reference book."
5,Stimulating and brilliant!,"Timothy Ferris is both a intelligent and humorous guide in our journey through the two parts of this tape. In the first part, the first 60 minutes, he explores how life developed on Earth and if there can be life on other worlds. On the second, he examines how man became intelligent, if intelligence could develop on other worlds and how to communicate with that alien intelligence. Lovely special effects, a great musical sore, interviews with scientists and just plain common sense makes the tape a MUST for any library. From PBS it has nothing that might upset the kiddies, so let them view it also!""The long twilight of human loneliness may come to an end within our lifetime."" - Timothy Ferris."
4,Subliminal white noise,"I put this on as I lay down to sleep and let the music wash over me, and hopefully the subliminal message will come through."
5,Best scooter for preschoolers on the market!!!,"I searched and searched for the perfect scooter for my little boy and I found it!! This little scooter is his absolute favorite thing we own. The 3 big wheels ride so smooth over rough roads or our carpet. He rides this thing all over the house all day long pretending to ""drive"" to different places. I bought it for him to get some exercise and he has come up with 100 different ways to use it for pretending- who knew? My son never gets tired of riding this scooter- he loves doing it inside and on nice days he loves taking it out just as much. The bell is really the icing on the cake too- he loves being able to ding at me to get out of the way!! This thing was worth every single penny."
4,mostly worthwhile,"Almost all of the performances are good, and it's a real treat to hear the live recordings. The only one that seems to miss the mark is Weber's."
3,Dremel Grout Router Attachment,"The Dremel 568 grout removal accessory works, but I quickly broke the small carbide bit that was included. I had to go out and buy a couple of 1/8"" dia bits from my home improvement store. These wore out fast because the sanded grout used was very hard to remove. Tried the bit alone, without the plastic attachment. This way I got too close and cut part of a tile edge. I recommend using the tool with just a small amount of grout engagement. After going over a good sized area, extend the bit 1/16th inch and go over it again. My shower tile was only 1.0"" squares. The more common 4-1/4"" tiles would be easier to work with."
1,harry potter,"this game is exactly like pokemon. class dissmissed.really thats it in a nutshell. they have ""magical incounters"", which is exactly like pokemon battles. you can also buy things. and, besides the characters and items, it is not like the book at all. in gringotts did harry walk around?"
2,Disapointing,"This game is way different from what i hoped and pictured it to be. 1st it has a whole bunch of tasks not in the book or movie! Second it is confusing and hard. I really enjoy Harry Potter, but not this. I hope the second game (when it comes out) will be much better, because it needs to."
3,just like anytime/anywhere,"It cost more to ship than the book cost. It was just like the Yoga, Anytime Anywhere, I wasted my money."
1,Lousy index; Dangerous stretch on page 42,The quad stretch shown on page 42 is very damaging to the knee.IT is impossible to find things in the book due to the poor index and poor chapter titles.
2,Need to buy multiple!,"Beware, you need at least two, and most air cleaners require 3 of these. And when stacked they aren't as effcient as a large single filter. But if you can't find the larger single replacement filter these will do."
4,"Doesn't fit perfectly in 18150, but works","The filter model I have, 18150, requires two of these with no foam spacers. Two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter I purchased once previously. However, I'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall, maybe slightly less. The cover still goes on, but not as far down as it should.As for filtering, I estimate that it filters the same as the previous. The ""permanence"" of this filter makes me wonder why I've been replacing the previous style, since I can see no difference in the filter material."
5,Honeywell Permanent Hepa Filter,Wish I had bought this years ago. Works just as well as the throw aways but all I have to do if vacuum it every month or two and it works great!!!
5,5th grade bullying,I read and discussed this book with my 5th graders. It was powerful and lead to many insights for the students.
4,What Happened to the Stickers?!,"I purchased this book for my 2 year old as I had it as a child and absolutely loved it! While the story is really cute, and my daughter enjoys it very much, I have to say I'm dissappointed in the scratch-n-sniff stickers in this edition. I agree with the reviewer who said the shape of the stickers was a part of the charm of this book, and now they are cheap round circles instead of shaped like the specific items. Additionally, the smells aren't very strong; some of them don't even smell like anything. If it weren't for that, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,DON'T call this a scratch and sniff book!,"The book's story line is perfectly cute but the scented stickers in this book lost all of their scents after only about a week (yes, really a week). I remember scratch and sniff books growing up, and even have a few from the 80s that I read to my kids now. They still have some of the scents! I bought this one because they love all the different smells from my older version ones and thought this would add to the collection. If you are looking for a great little book with a cute story only, this book is fine... but if you are interested in experiencing the smells that go along with it, this book falls short. :("
2,Smells only lasted one week!,"I was very disappointed that my granddaugther's favorite book only lasted a few times in scratching the smells.Only the pine tree smell remains. Not worth it, unfortunately."
3,Nice clips,"Raw footage, no complete speeches so far. I haven't seen them all yet but I'm not impressed with the quality. Probably won't buy from Speech Works again."
2,The Greatest Speeches of All-Time...poorly presented and edited down to almost nothing,"OK, so I bought this box set to supplement my American History classes. I figured that it'd be helpful to have hard copies so I wasn't at the mercy of Youtube or a poor Internet connection to show some of these speeches to my classes. As it turns out, I would have been significantly better off not bothering. I can't even tell you how disappointed I am that some of the speeches have been edited down to almost nothing. Take Martin Luther King's ""I've Been to the Mountaintop"" speech, which is well over 20 minutes long. No kidding, this DVD contains only about a minute of the speech! There is no commentary, no context, or anything besides a brief introduction that mentions the setting of the speech.Other speeches aren't as badly cut, but as far as I know there are only a few complete speeches on this disk.For the price ($30) there isn't much value to this set."
3,"Excellent Sound, Vice-like Grip","Upon first putting these beautiful headphones on, I thought, ""Wow"" - they had great sound quality, a balanced sound range and a good fit. After about 10 minutes, my ears started hurting, and I got a headache. The tension in the headband is so tight that it squeezes together slowly, eventually becoming so uncomfortable that I had to remove them. I even had someone with a small head try them, and they had the same problem. If they had softer ear pads, and less of a 'vice-like' grip, they would be perfect."
3,"Comfortable, yes. Boomy? Extremely.","I write music myself, and I find these headphones to be obnoxiously boomy. 250-500hz range is really overrepresented in the spectrum - to make it in line with everything else I had to attenuate more than -3db! The high end of the spectrum is a bit underrepresented as well. Things sound relatively fine at low volumes but when you bring it up, it's too bassy and tends to drown out higher frequencies. The equalizer settings I felt most comfortable with when using these headphones were these: -1db@125, -3db@250, -4db@500, +1db@4k, +1db@8k."
2,"Great sound, poor construction","I used these headphones at a desk job, listening to my iPod or NPR streaming online. The sound quality was great, I had nothing to complain about there, however the construction was junk. One of the ear pieces completely broke off the band while I was simply putting them on.I liked the headphones (although the design is gaudy), but I'll be switching to a pair of Sennheiser HD202's next for the increased durability."
2,Garbage,"Note: I own the Metallica Death Magnetic version.BUYER BEWARE. This piece of junk is NOT sound canceling, and it can clearly be hear by other people in the room. The quality is below average compared to buds, and rest on the ears weirdly. The ""amazing bass quality"" that people rave about is sub par. Do not buy, go sony instead."
1,"Look Good, Built Cheaply","I bought these headphones three months ago because I was really digging their look. Most headphones are kind of boring while Skullcandy admittedly makes some beautiful/edgy products. However, these headphones have been a big disappointment. First, the fit actually hurt my ears if I wore them for prolonged periods of times because of their circular shape instead of oval shape. Secondly the plastic piece connecting the earpiece to the band just split in two. Cheap construction. I haven't given up on Skullcandy simply because I love their designs, but I would recommend checking out other brands if you can't spend extra money on getting Skullycandy's more expensive/hopefully higher quality products."
2,Not worth even $50 dollars.,"Don't be fooled by most of the favorable reviews on this product. If you plan on using these headphones on a daily basis they will eventually break on you within months. They are uncomfortable for extended periods of use and make it a chore to even have them on for more than 5 minutes. After having them for about 2 months I started noticing that they were cracking, in the same spot on opposite sides just about the first indentation line. 2 days later they broke completely. This, after being stored in their carrying bag all the time with minimal handling."
4,Recommended by Presenter,A group of teachers at my school went to the National Board presentation done by our state presenter. She recommended this book as a helpful workbook through this process. I plan on going through this process this coming year. I will enter another review then. I am hoping that our state presenter's recommendation is correct!
4,"Great routines, but Zyrka's obviously sick with a cold!","I was really looking forward to a more advanced yoga practice with this instructor, since I already have Gentle Vinyasa Flow and I use it more often than any of my other yoga DVDs. Zyrka's soft, soothing voice is exquisite on that one, and would have been just as wonderful on this one except she was so sick with a cold when she recorded this soundtrack that I found myself unable to bear listening to her. If my head was as stopped up as hers was, I think I would have waited until it cleared up before recording the postures for my audience to listen to over and over again. I did not keep this DVD because of this one sticking point. The scenery is even more beautiful than her previous release, and the exercises were just as flowing and well-planned, but I hope that in future she'll do the instruction part of her recording when she is well."
1,Pages Gashed,"I ordered the Collins CoBuild Student' Dictionary Plus Grammar. When looking at it for the first time, I noticed that there was a gash in the pages from page 773-804, and those pages cannot be turned without creating more of a tear. I had sent an email to the seller, and I received no return email. Now it is passed the date of return, and I am hoping that I can still exchange it for another copy as I am happy with the product itself. Now if only it was in great condition and completely usable.Extremely disappointed."
2,"These Hebrew ""codes"" are subjective.","Because Hebrew may be written without vowel points, a single 3-letter word may be translated several ways, depending on the context or pronunciation of the speaker. Yakov Rambsel makes grammatical mistakes, or chooses to translate his ""codes"" to fit the meaning he prefers. A few examples: He may ignore pronominal endings: ""kadshi"" on page 54 is ""my,"" not ""his"" holiness. He calls ""dakar"" on page 55(4), a verb: ""they have pierced,"" when it is really ""he pierced."" It could also be the gerund: ""piercing."" The name Melchizedek on page 213 should be spelled with a tzadi instead of an ayin. ""Messiah, Tabernacle"" at the bottom of page 124 could easily be translated, ""A messiah lived in a tent."" Other code phrases could be interpreted with wild variations. Perhaps an objective editor, a truly Hebrew-speaking professor, would be useful to the author. Although his theology may be genuine, his basic Hebrew errors are discrediting."
2,Are we there yet?,The first Kyuss I was exposed to was Demon Cleaner and Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop so when I listened to Wretch I was pretty disapointed. Not that it's bad it's just not good but you do hear a glimpse of what's to come.
5,Matthew Bible Study Guide,"I was very pleased with the material I received! The price, prompt delivery, and condition of the book where all pleasing!Thank You Very Much & God Bless You : )"
3,Not quite ready for this yet,"I bought this set in red for my toddler son because he likes to play with dishes. The only thing is I had to remove the cooking utensils from the set and hide them away since they had sharp edges. Maybe the set would be more appropriate for a child over 4 years of age, not a 2 to 3 year old. He does, however, like playing with the pots and their lids and likes putting things like cars in them."
5,A real winner.,"Saw the book featured on Oprah's show on Martin Luther King, Jr., and bought it. Have bought three more for all grandchildren. Touching, funny, revealing and very well designed. Every kid, of any age, should have one."
5,the Plasmatics will always be the best,"The Plasmatics were.... I really don't know how to classify them.Once in a lifetime. they were sooooo original, so rocking.Beyond the Valley of 1984 is a classic piece of music."
3,My M.O.D. review for the year,"When you give this album the March of Dimes treatment, it's not half-bad. But it's nowhere near as good as their debut, which was absolutely blistering; especially for a first effort (and a joke, at that).This album bridges the band's inevitable slide over to the slower (dumber) garbage metal outfit they put on for 'Coup D'Etat.' There's still flashes of the old Plasmatics (""Pig is a Pig"", ""Fast Food Service""), and even the lyric-less ""Plasma Jam"" has a certain Ramones-likability to it, but ""Summernite"" and ""Masterplan"" are less than b-sides, and the redundant ""Living Dead"" sounds like a discarded out-take of the original version.Flashy cover and gatefold (LP version), but it's really not up to par, and their final album (and all of Wendy's solo output) is worthless. For die-hards only."
4,I love this game,I got this game for my fifth birthday and play it one or two times a week. I really like playing it.
4,Nec Ilustrated book,It's a very important and easy book for all the people which have to work with the NEC. I liked it a lot.
5,FoodSaver,"This is the most MAGNIFICENT machine in my kitchen, well, almost! I bought this one as a replacement for one that no longer worked well. What I like to do is save the black food trays from frozen dinners and make my own microwave dinners. I put left-overs in the trays and place them in bags that I cut from the rolls to fit. Many people use zip lock type bags for this, but let me tell you-the FoodSaver bags keep your food in fresh, first-cooked quality whereas the zip lock bags don't. Lasts much longer in the freezer too-you don't have to worry about freezer burn. I definitely recommend this product!"
4,Very good so far.,"Requires quite intensive study, no scanning but extremely interesting. Looking forward to the remainder of the book, only twenty pages into it."
5,A Precious Resource,"People have criticized this book because the author seems to have an editorial perspective. I find him to be an excellent critical thinker who draws insightful conclusions and has the brilliance to identify consequences.Barzun had my attention from the first chapter where he made me wonder if the entire reformation sparked by Luther was an unintended consequence enabled by the newly introduced printing press.Don't miss this. It is lots of work, but the payoff is enormously fulfilling."
5,Excellent,"An excellent record of world history, in very readable, down-to earth writing. After an interesting discussion of the events and the people who have led us to where we are today, the author discuss the changes in our Civilization that will most probably occur in the near, as well as in our distant, future. I enjoy picking up the book and re-reading at any page at all; it is truly an interesting book to read."
2,dull tome,"The author, an esteemed scholar, provides a history of everyone you never heard of. Unfortunately, he fails to bring these obscure characters to life, or to demonstrate why the general reader should care about them."
3,Dull: his arbitrary opinions are fun but that's about it,"one would be better served by reading Jensens's Reformation and Ren. books, as well as Palmer and Colton's textbook. These are dull books, but they are no more so than JB's. The only good parts of DD are the end and begining--where he let's it all hang out. Otherwise, it is spotty, insipid, and dull. Read a textbook, you will be better served. (and Davies is better) ...But a hell of a lot better than Paul Johnson."
5,"Works on Black & Decker, too.","Someone told me I could convert my Dremel to keyless Jacobs chuck, and I ordered this. Then when it came (like, the next day!) I realized I don't HAVE a Dremel-- my rotary tool is a Black & Decker. Awww, darn! And there are no instructions, either.Well, don't panic. I unscrewed the collet sleeve, took out the collet, and screwed this on. Ta da! It works perfectly. Yay! No more wrapping tape around something that's just a little too small, so the collet will hold it. No more hunting for where I put that darned little collet I now need. Etc. Perfect-- cheap at twice the price, as someone else commented."
5,saves a lot of time and its easier to use..,"This chuck works great, it's easier to operate than the ones that come with the dremel. It's very strong, all steel construction not aluminum . Amazon shipped this item right away..great experience with amazon as always..."
3,Great gift item,"Purchased this item for my father in law for christmas, he appears to like the dremel tool, hope one day I can borrow it to I can provide a better report, item was delivered in a very timely fashion"
1,Disappointed,This chuck really disappointed me. There is so much wobble that it is pretty much not usable. I'm afraid the vibration would do damage to the bearings in my Dremel motor. Not anywhere near the quality I expected from the Dremel name brand.
5,A real time saver,I purchased this to replace the four collets on my Dremel Variable Speed Rotary Tool. No more fumbling with the collets every time I change bits with different size shanks. I would however suggest if you are removing or deburring heavy material to use the collets. This would avoid overtighting the chuck and possibly damaging it. I do clean the interior jaws with compressed air as fine dust can make it difficult to open and close.
4,Much easier!,"I really don't know why Dremel doesn't include the keyless chuck with all their tools, unless they just want you to buy all the different collets. Still worth buying though!"
2,Does not fit 1/8th,None of my 1/8 bits worked in it.I must say that this part is really not necessary. I wanted a much larger chuck (like 5/8) to work the dremel as a drill. This wasn't possible because of its small size.
5,Get a Grip,When used as directed in accompanying instructions this item performs exactly as claimed. There's no doubt in my mind that this is one of Dremel's better attachments.
1,disappointed,"Right from the getgo, this chuck will not tighten the bit sufficiently; during operation, the bit will pop out of chuck. I got so disgusted with it, that I threw it away. I do not recommend."
5,Must have for Dremel users,"This little attachment is the best thing I have bought for my Dremel. You can quickly switch from standard 3/32"" shank bits to various drill bits and back with no tools needed. IMO this should have be included with Dremel tools right from the manufacturer."
4,Should be standard on Dremels,"As other have said, this should be the standard collet that comes with the Dremel. It's super handy to have a ""one size fits all"" collet instead of having to change them out. That being said, it should be noted you DO still need to tighten this about a quarter turn or so with the wrench after you hand tighten it so I think the ""keyless"" part is a little misleading. If you don't do this your bit will probably become loose as you use it. It even has the flat sides for the wrench so they obviously knew this would be needed. Additionally, it is a little larger than the normal collets so if you are using this in a very tight space where collet size could matter then this might be a problem for you. For most applications, though, I think this is much better and more convenient and would highly recommend it."
4,PTSD Help!,"If you have this, read this book, do the exercises and you will learn more about yourself, your reactions and your interaction with everyday life. I had an exceptional experience with this purchase. Thank you."
4,I needed help.,"I turned to ""The PTSD Workbook"" for help after discovering a tragedy from my past. This book has been great help for my recovery. I found the techniques more useful than years of therapy. I feel that anyone dealing with a tragic event from thier past could find the help to start living again from this book."
3,"Sloppy editing, aimless narrative, but entertaining","This book reminded me a bit of the latter days of the ""99 princes in amber"" series. The story kept me turning pages, but the author didn't seem to be paying much attention. It felt like Chalker didn't really have control over the narrative; in places he writes well, in others he careens towards any sort of ending. He really doesn't seem to know what to do with his characters.Equally annoying is some very sloppy editing producing some meaningless sentences. Chalker himself seems to have forgotten why ""The Avenger"" stalks the Empress -- the explanation given in book two is completely different from that of book one.Despite all this Chalker can weave a story, and this book made for some pleasantly mindless entertainment."
3,"An adequate book, an inadequate sequel","While I found the first book of this story-line to be one of his best in years, evoking the adventure of the early Well World books, the follow-through is adequate at best. I found it extremely predictable and I had pretty much guessed the ""surprise ending"" soon after they went through the Zone Gate in the first book. And I never found the Straight Gate to be the terrifying doomsday weapon that Chalker tried to make it. He never sold me on the fear factor which would have added at least a little tension to the story. Again, the first book was excellent, the second was inadequate as a follow-up."
5,Loved it!,Boy this novel was one of my favorites of Little's. It had everything I liked in a novel and reminded me some of Steven King's Needful Things with a very different twist that kept me interested.
5,great book,"If you love Stephen King you will really love this guy. Bentley Little has quite a few books out. The ones I found really good were, The Association, The House, The Store, The Academy."
4,Worth the Price of Admission,"This is my third Bentley Little book, and I come to realize what attracts me to his work. He's entertaining. He's no Hemingway, nor Steinbeck, and never will be. He's a writer with a twisted and off-kilter perspective on our society. He doesn't seem to take himself seriously, which is a good thing. The Store is a great little diversion for a few days, and it's worth the seven bucks. You can do much worse with the money. Like going to see any movie in the theaters these days."
3,Really good book alot of fun to read,"I found this book to be fast-paced,fun and action-packed.I found myself caring about the characters alot.The plot was believable and kept me enthralled for hours.I think that some of the incidence that happened in the book were a little far-fetched and I was amazed at how much THE STORE actually got away with,but who knows maybe that really can happen.I felt though at the end of the book the author was running out of ideas as how to finish the story,leaving me with the feeling that there should have been more to add at the end. I was surprised also how the main character changed his mind so quickly and decided to join them in the end,sort of if you can't beat em join em attitude.But I enjoyed the book all the same and will be reading THE MAILMAN next."
3,Don't belive the rave reviews...,"I spent most of the time while I was reading this book, wondering why the characters in the story were putting up with the antics of THE STORE.It makes it tough to enjoy a story when most of the characters are portrayed as being intelligent, yet they are clueless about how to deal with the obviously evil STORE.(PSSST.....Don't shop there!)"
4,Classic Bentley Little,"I have found that there are two styles of writing for Bentley Little. There is the regular horror writing style and then there is the outrageous, macabre style. This is the latter. Much like ""The Resort"", this one will blow your mind. The outrageousness of it is almost snuck in between normal activity in the book. You then find yourself turning back to see if that was what you really read. It was. Trust me.I gave the book 4 stars. It is by no means a masterpiece, but it is entertaining and that is why we read Little, to be entertained. If I was to go into to any detail, it would give away the story. So, read it for yourself and you be the judge!I might suggest reading something like ""The Resort"", ""The Policy"", ""The Collection"". Those will give new Little readers a glimpse of what to expect. Enjoy!"
2,silly but entertaining,"This is a very silly book. The concept is scary enough, but it is done with absolutely no subtlety whatsoever....It seems like the theme could be addressed better in metaphor. Visualizing some of the things in this book just make me laugh--like the bikini clad girls that bring Bill his food...Honestly, I feel like the crappy Resident Evil movies did a better job with representing The Umbrella Corporation's threats than this book did. It definitely seemed influenced by some of King's cheesier bits.But, it's an entertaining enough read, if you are a quick reader. I read very fast and read it in one evening...however, if you are the type of person who takes a longer time to get through a book, I wouldn't recommend bothering with this. I don't think it would be a good use of your time.I might try reading something else by this author, just to see, though. Like I said--silly, but entertaining."
3,Not his best but a decent read,"Considering that this book was published nearly 10 years ago - the topicality of Bentley Little's searing attack on Big-Box retailers (eg - Walmart, Costco, etc) still feels as fresh and relevant today as it did back in 1998. Sure, he's done better work since then and the ending is diminished by its haphazard closure but nonetheless the hallmarks of Little's novels (brisk pacing, outrageous and bizarre scenarios and poignant black satire) remain intact and ultimately make this a decent read for fans of Little and the genre itself."
1,Puerile and Ludicrous,"Can't anyone ever come up with a better conspiracy plot than at one extreme the government taking over and at the other capitalism? Give me a break! It's like a horror comic book spliced with a hard-core porn rag, meant to be shocking but ultimately laughable. But maybe if they could take an okay Stephen King story and concoct the * movie ""Maximum Overdrive,"" then maybe the reverse can happen here, but who'd bother?"
3,What Wal-Mart would aspire to if they could,"This book is not Bentley Little's best, but not his worst either. It contains his usual formulaic script: Normal people vs not normal demon possesed loonies with a touch of sadistic sex thrown in for good measure. Not a real scare fest, but I like his books because they are a quick read and since I do alot of my reading while on line at school waiting for my kids to come out this fills the bill. Kind of like junk food novels. I would recommend this book for those who like the above. If your looking for Stephen King caliber, then read Stephen King (who I also LOVE!)"
4,Sacramento puts it down!,This cd is the hottest thing to touch the earth in years!TMH puts it down for the 213!They come with a hard hitting fast pace hip hop message that it is shore to rattle your truck and make you want to get up out of your seat and start c-walking.
5,This book will remind you of the things we take for granted!,"This book is a reminder to those of us who take this country for granted and the fact that we take freedom for granted--Those of us born here often don't appreciate the gift of freedom that others have to earn when they seek asylum in this country. This book gives us a good look at both sides of the picture. It makes us aware of our weaknesses and our strengths as a country, and made me understand that because I was born here I gain freedoms that others have to spend years fighting for.The difference is they come here seeking political asylum only to be jailed worse than some of our hardened criminals while suffering though the horrible INS bureaucracy. As Fauziya demonstrates in this book,good things come to those who wait.Even though her story brings some of our weakness as a country to light, she remains grateful to be here every day."
1,Format,"Regrettably, the discs won't play in US formatted DVD players. I remember these films from the early 1970's and was elated to have found them available only to be disappointed. Here is what they said:Our DVDs are in UK format. If you cannot play them in the USA you will need to contact the company from whom you purchased for and exchange or refund. The USA has a different TV system to the UK so you need to check that DVDs are compatible before purchasing from the UK."
2,dead battery,"The clock is beautiful, but I received the clock and the battery was dead. I returned the clock and ordered another one. The second one was delivered quickly, but the battery in the second clock was also dead."
1,Doesn't Suck... and that's not good,"My wife bought this vacuum for Christmas 2005, here it is May 2006 and it has completely lost all suction. When it did work it did a pretty good job although is was terribly loud and got very warm, almost hot.I wrote to the company that manufactures it... We'll see how good their customer service is.UPDATE...I wrote an earlier review which stated that the vacuum we purchased stopped sucking completely. I contacted the company and after just a few emails they decided to replace it for no charge. I received the new vacuum which I believe is actually a re-furbished one but it works fine. We'll see if the same problem reoccurs. For now, I give it 3 stars for good customer service."
2,Don't use for cold water washes,"I have sensitive skin so All Free Clear is a great product for me. However, I recently used it in my washing machine set on cold water for my darks and my clothes came out spotted with undissolved white specks of detergent. I never noticed a problem when it was used in warm water though. My recommendation if you want to buy this product is to purchase the liquid format."
5,Takes on the big questions,This book synthesizes two completely different fields - philosophy and cognitive psychology - to extract some intriguing insights into the origin and definition of the soul.Few modern writers try to tackle such fundamental philosophical and religious territory and fewer still actually contribute new ideas to the dialogue. McGraw does - with wit and style to boot.
2,this book fails to deliver,"i live in Manhattan, and i wanted a coffe table book for my new apt. i thought this book would be a great photography book showing manhattan in its entirety ... this book accomplishes the goal, but just doesnt work. it is extremely difficult to find a location in this book (for example, the block you live on now), b/c the aerial shots are just too high up. i was especially disappointed that i wasnt able to identify streets or smaller buildings. yes, it shows all of Manhattan BUT it doesnt do this in a way that is fun to look at OR user-friendly.i would 100% recommend that someone look at this in a book store before buying."
3,Model not a model,"One problem with buying on line is relying on words rather than touch. I wanted a model to assemble not an assembled model. I got a nice assembled model engine, my bad."
5,Definitely a game for the Doom fanatics out there,"I first played this game at a friends house back in 95, and I loved it. He beat the game thanks to the codes they give you to pass through the levels so when you do play it, just enter the code and you are back on the level you started.What made this game great was the violence, this is not a game for kids, but it is old, and the graphics were good for that time, but they kind of stand the test of time. It is nothing like Halo, but Zero Tolerance was the game that Doom fans who owned a Genesis (which I did, and still do) and they wanted to kill some enemies with their shotguns, then this was the game to play, still fun after 7 years, but still good no matter what."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,I ordered a 3 inch potted plant and the item I received was pieces of the plant I ordered in rough shape(one piece is actually dead the other two are hanging on for life) and packaged very poorly.There is no pot for the plant or soil and no directions on how to care for the plant.
1,Ugh!,"Skip this one, which arrived dead on arrival. The replacement died an ugly death, too. Buy your cactus in a store, where you can look at it and make sure it appears to be healthy. Beware over-watering."
1,rip off!,"Prickly pear pads are available in many places for as low as 99 cents. They root easily from pad or pieces and can be obtained nearly everywhere. Twenty dollars is pretty much too much to pay for nearly ANY common opuntia. There are some rare opuntias, but this one is not and a tiny common cactus is not a good value for 49.99$That's my opinion. Do research and don't buy this!"
3,"Works fine, but too fragile","As noted in other reviews, this touch dimmer works well, but tends to self-destruct when the bulb goes out. My most recent purchase lasted only a year. With that kind of life expectancy, it's kind of a an expensive proposition to keep replacing it."
5,Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble,"And as always is SRV's music is outstanding! However, the case was broken so how can I review it than anything more that on a 1-10 is a 1.Cheers,Greg"
1,Defective one,I have received a defective one and can't see any damage on it in this simple equipment. Hopefully others are more lucky.
4,Worth it :),"It would be nice if the extension cord was less stiff, but overall it works well. It isn't fancy, but it does its job. I like that, unlike some other surge protectors, the switch has a light that indicates whether it's on or off."
1,unable to plug in cords,"I returned this product. We have older wiring in our home, and there are surges all summer long due to the A/C. We try to replace all surge protectors once a year to try to protect our electrial items. This product had excellent reviews, so I purchased it. Did not work! There was only one place where I was able to plug in a 3 prong connection.I don't have a lot of strength in my hands right now, but I was still able to plug in devices in other new surge protectors. Looking at the strip, there is some type of metal running through the 3rd prong area that prevents any cord from going in. Very disappointed!"
5,Great Entry-level Power Protection,"These surge strips are a great, low-cost protection device for your electronic equipment. The protection circuit indicator lets you know when the device has sacrificed itself for your equipment. It has good specs., small profile, long cord and an awesome price. And don't forget Tripp Lite's lifetime guarantee."
1,A mistake,"Yes, I Agree 100% with Erica Miller's review. We, however, own a cleaning service and had much the same responce from our clients when we picked up a canister of fur out of their carpet.Much to our suprise was the customer support. We bought 2 Vacuums and both have had the belts go and the belts are on back order now for 6 weeks, and we have waited 2 hours on the phone to reach a live person and E-mailed with absolutely no results. I would strongly recommend that you make a purchase other than this one. Especially if you are much like myself and value a company more on the service that you receive and then the products. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!"
4,An Unusual Start,"Most people who start a series of naval fiction in the age of sail take as their protagonist a young midshipman or lieutenant. Then, over the course of the development of the series, we see the protagonist develop into a better officer and rise in the ranks. Michael Aye has done something different. His character starts as a post captain fresh from a major victory. There would seem to be little room for upward mobility with a start like that but the book is worth reading.Captain Anthony is assigned to suppress piracy in the Caribbean. He does so at a time when the stage is being set for the American Revolution. Tensions are running high but conflict has not yet broken out. The pirates are everyone's enemies and the captain proves to be an effective suppressor of their trade.The book is extremely fast paced and enjoyable to read. Some to the situation and solutions seem to reek too much of coincidence but it is a fun read. I look forward to more."
4,Great Read !!!,"I've just finished this book in two days and really enjoyed it. It is written in the fashion of Dudley Pope, Alexander Kent and Charles White.Plenty of action and romance for the ""Fighting Anthonys"", two (half-)brothers chasing pirates in the Caribean at the eve of the American Revolution.I am glad I purchased this and the second book "" The Sea Wolf"" together, so I can continue with the story of Gil and Gabe without interuption.Can we expect book three + ? I hope so..."
3,small font,"I ordered this new testament because I wanted one I could carry around with me. The size was very nice for carrying in purse or pocket. However, the font size was so small (for my over 50 eyes) that I could not read nor enjoy it even with my glasses. I was truly disappointed. It cost me close to $20 and I ended up returning it to amazon. The return process was easy, like amazon promises. However, between shipping costs and restocking fees, I only got back about $10. If I have known that... I would have kept it and just given it to a friend!"
2,ok for outside pictures,"This camera is VERY easy to use, that is why I bought it.But, I still am having terrible trouble centering the pictures with it, and I do not like what inside pictures look like.I am returning the camera today."
2,The polarizing ring came off,"The polarizing ring fell off! it completly desintergrated from the lens. I was reading on multiple site that this is a common occurance. overall not happy, i purchased a BW filter, and its day and night. If you forked over for nice lens, might as well fork over some more money and get a nice filter... that also has a warrenty. like a BW"
2,did not work,"the lights were for Christmass gifts and after giving a couple of them early they did not work, so we had to buy some from lowes"
5,Powerful soul-stirring music,"If you have grown weary of insipid contemporary Christian music (haven't we all?), this is the antidote. Such beauty and power! This recording truly inspires."
1,Waste of Money!! DONT Buy,"This product is cheaply made, does not produce enough steam to clean anything! The idea and the price are tempting, but the Penguin does not live up to expectations. My thumbs are sore after tryng to clean my stove - I finally gave up and just scrubbed it. If the whole idea is for this product to make cleaning grime easier, it does not, and using something like this just on everyday ""dirt"" like a kitchen counter is not worth the time or thumb power."
1,If you are considering this item just throw your money away,"and save yourself the frustration! Wish I'd read these reviews before I bought mine! Junk, doesn't do anything you hope for or expect and with the poor performance it stops looking so cute! Save your money!"
3,"Lots of Creative Ideas, Potentially Overwhelming","I enjoyed the fact that the author compiled ideas from hundreds of homeschooling families around the country. That gave a little glimpse into the lives of a diversity of homeschooling families.My main problem with this book, like the other homeschooling compendiums, is that one can quickly get lost and overwhelmed (or is it just me?) I just kept reading thinking ""Okay, I will have to decide what out learning styles are and choose ideas based on that."" Once I read a book filled with hundreds of ideas like this one, I finish it not sure exactly where to begin.Having said that, I still see that the book could be a very useful resource for homeschoolers looking for more fun activities to complement their curriculum."
5,Beginning readers ages 3-6 will relish this zany story,"Beginning readers ages 3-6 will relish this zany story of Gritch the Witch, who becomes exhausted trying to prepare for her big howliday party. A bossy big sister keeps her from much-needed sleep but brings some surprises when they become broom mates a day early. This Halloween howler will be welcomed year-round during all seasons."
4,Best Game of its First Kind,The graphics are just the best of its first I've ever seen. The polygons and the clear graphics that Sega put out are just fantastic. The arcadey driving of a indy car is so fun in this game. I recommend you play.
1,...grrrrr...,I wanted Virtua Racing on the Genesis. I got Virtua Racing Deluxe instead. On the 32X. I can't play it.
5,high potency,I have the 100 tablet bottle of this but think I will get the 250 tab size next time. The tablets are huge 'horse' pills but I bought myself a mortar and pestle and grind them into powder. Then I add the powder to my oatmeal. They are high potency and well worth the money.
4,Great Divide .....another winner,"Afterglow.. what a title..a perfect name. Because as after you listen to this album you are in a glow. A very good album ( not as good as ""Revolutions"" or ""Break in The Storm"") My favorite song? ""Wildflower"", the way Mike McClure does it acoustic and then comes back with drums and electric guitars just blows me away. I sincerly think these guys deserve so much more than they are getting.I listen to what passes as music these days and I scratch my head....These guys are just so much better than alot of stuff out there. Mike McClure is so talented. a great songwriter and guitarist. My only complaint? I wanted them to include this little song that they do sometimes in concert about the 60's.using all these titles from old rock n roll songs.(Maybe on the next album) I have seen them on stage in front of thousands of people and I have seen them in front of as few as 50-60 people. They are great musicians and I think you would enjoy this album."
5,Great Job Search and Application process,"Wonderful tool to polish your introduction at Head Hunters and Recruits. Found very useful, helpful, and fully interesting for any Career Job searcher."
3,Could of had more to it.,"I bought this game thinking there was going to be more to it than fighting borg aliens all through it. Then when you run out of ammunition, well its just pretty much the end of the game and you have to start all over again from the beginning of the game and do it all over again. The part of the game I actually liked playing is the holodeck simulation battles, and this part needs another player.With ok graphics, nothing amazing. Its not one of my favorites."
5,Packs in many options and insights perfect for any general lending library,"How to Retire Happy, Wild and Free offers retirement basics that go far beyond the usual money-oriented approach, offering inspirational advice on how to enjoy life. From taking early retirement and putting money in perspective to make it work to generating purpose with creative goals and taking charge of health, this packs in many options and insights perfect for any general lending library."
2,Master of repetition,"The author makes a number of good points regarding the challenges and creative responses to retirement, then repeats them ad nauseum throughout the book. The entire content of this book would be equally well addressed in a 3 page article."
2,Boring read!,"I have never written a review about a book but this is an exception. I will have to agree with another reviewer. I found it to say the same thing throughout the book. Not any real help for those searching for creative ideas unless you have lots of income. He talks about money doesn't have a part in a fulfilling retirement and then turns around and writes about how rewarding traveling and other expensive hobbies and activities can be. Does this guy live in the real world? Reminds me of the song, ""Don't worry, be happy"".In other words, when you retire just throw resposibility out the window and do whatever the heck you want to do without consideration for anyone else or consequences."
5,"Unique, non-financial, resource for the soon-to-be retire.","Fun and informative book for the newly or soon to be retired. Lot of great ideas and philosphy for the person who is transitioning to a new life, a new chapter of life. It is not a financial planning book. There are plenty of those out there. It really is a book about everything about retiring that your financial planner never told you. I tried to read as much as I could without breaking the binding - it is going to be a gift. Well written with a lot of good advice. Great to be able to preview before buying so I knew exactly what I was getting."
2,"How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free",The contents of the book do not live up to the title. Basic information--not as inspiring as the title would suggest.
3,Needs to be fact checked,"I bought this book because it had good reviews and had been published recently. It may have been published recently but it was written about 10 years ago. The book presents some good ideas, but a lots of the facts presented have changed. He talks about Ben Kerr from Toronto as if he is still alive, when he died years ago. He also talks about a couple living on a boat in Hawaii, if you Google them you will find they are now happily separated. And Leonard Stokowski, if he signed a 6 year contract at age 96 that would have been a real miracle, since he died at age 95! I have a hard time taking most of it seriously now that I know the author didn't care enough to check his facts."
4,Very nice bagless vacuum! Good abilities!,"In short, this is a very good vacuum cleaner. The suction is decent, and it seems to have excellent tools and abilities to use them. The emptying canister is also very easy to remove and place back, and the bottom emptying canister with the hand crank dirt removal assist is great! It's about time bagless vacs were engineered for easy canister removal and disposal of dirt! The only reasons I hesitate to give this 5 stars is that suction could be stronger AND some dirt remains on the bottom door of the canister when emptying, thus easily flying out if you close the bottom door briskly. Also, the vac is pretty heavy. All in all, this is truly an excellent vac."
5,Beautiful Album,"I bought this LP back in 1979 and it quickly became one of my all time favourite albums. I started getting into Badfingers music shortly after Peter Ham died. Though it does miss the sounds of Pete's voice and songs, I'm glad Tommy and Joey got together to make this album."
5,Love this product,This is one of the best products that you can find to freshing your home of odors. I recieved my order on time as a matter of fact I believe that it was earlier that what it that the date given. I'm 100 percent satified.
3,Nice except for the fragrances,"I had a Rainbow Rainmate which is essentially the same thing as this except for a different design. For some reason it stopped working and I bought this as a replacement. I like the blue light myself although it may not be for everyone. I would not think that this would actually purify any significant amount of air but it does a great job of clearing up household odors from cooking, pets, smoke etc.In my opinion, the scents that came with this were absolutely horrible. I do not like the smell of Pinesol and I certainly don't want my house cranking out that smell all day. I thought the citrus scent would be nice but could not smell anything but PineSol and it gave me a headache. I don't like lime scent much and the vanilla really didn't smell like much of anything. Luckily there are other alternatives from other companies. This item is the same type of thing that Rainmate and Thermax makes and you can find scents made for these around."
4,Linda,"I purchased the Homedics Brethe Air Revitalizer about a month ago, as I was refilling it I notice a crack in the bowl. I email Homedics and describe my problem with their product. They responded very quickly and are sending me a new bowl. As I stated in the email,I really like the machine but for the price, the bowl should be made of stronger material. Maybe if they get enough complaints they will change the material. I will give the machine 4 stars."
2,Disappointed,After watching the infomercial and reading all the reviews I decided to go out and purchase. Even by only using a fraction of the amount the directions indicated- The scents are terrible...really smells like cheap Pine Cleaner/ Cheap Perfume. In my opinion this product is not as 'wow' as it's made out to be. But then again it artificial smells don't bother you then go for it.
1,Ehhh!! :\,"My sister bought this for me last Christmas. I really thought that this was going to smell like... ya know.... like the 3 scents that it came with ( VANILLA, ORANGE, LIME).. but it doesn't.... it smells like PINE PINE AND PINE!!!! No matter what fragance you use, they all smell like PINESOL. I don't mind if I'm moppig the floor and I get that scent..cause hey that's the scent that I'm using. But if I'm expecting an orange scent then that's the scent that I should be smelling, but I'm not. Overall the product is eh!! I mean it has a pretty blue light that looks nice as the machine is doing it's thing but that's about it. Once the machine is off the water tends to look dirty ( even though I only have it for less than 10 minutes). It's not worth the $60 bucks she paid for it. You're better off getting one of those airwick automatic sprays or just lighting a candle if you want to get rid of odors. My overall opinion...IT STINKS!!!"
3,Leaks,"It works pretty well, but today we came home to find it leaked all over the place. Will try to find out why and post back to you."
2,Disappointed,I was expecting it to clean the dust and air out of the room. It seems to me that it is simply a aromatherapy machine.I returned it.
1,Wilson's worst book,"I was very disappointed with this book given the high standard of F.Paul Wilson's other works. I read the book after reading the online reviews which said it was 'Excellent"" and a 'Must Buy"", but it seemed to me this novel was something Mr Wilson put together on a wet Wednesday afternoon. In my opinion you'd be better off to save your money and wait for the next Repairman Jack novel."
5,Great!,I love this album. I listen to it often. I've enjoyed it for years. I used it as my morning alarm for a while (first song is great for mornings). I also like listening to it when sleeping. The reading is the perfect bedtime story (for me)! Beautiful voices. Catchy tunes. Great sound. Love it.
2,Not what I expected...,"These tap lights require 4 AA batteries each. I bought 4 tap lights, so the batteries ended up costing me more than the tap lights did. The tap lights used up all of the battery life in less than 2 hours! If you are going to use these, only expect them to use them minimally... You cannot use them for any extended length of time!"
1,Both of mine quit working within 24 hours.,"Within 24 hours of buying these in a two pack, both quit working. I replaced the batteries in both and one worked four hours longer before going out as well. After replacing the bulbs and batteries one last time and having them still not work, they made their new home in the trash can. I am now looking for replacements."
5,Original energetic smooth jazz. Great CD,"Anyone that buys this CD will enjoy this CT artist, we had the chance to see him play live. What a treat for anyone that loved blues or live jazz with a kick."
5,Palestrina Ascends,"I am an active choral singer. I have been in countless ensembles, this interpretation of Palestrina (the greatest word painter of all time) is truly breathetaking. It's worth every penny and I also recommend the beyond chant albums."
1,Wanted it to be better... But it just plain sucked,"When I bought this I was super psyched... I'm a huge radiohead fan. However, this is kinda a boring documentary box set. First the review of OK Computer I thought would be facinating. Nope. Just a bunch of people who are poorly introduced saying how great each song is, duh, and saying what they think about the lyrics. There is nothing about Radiohead here... it's not really about them and how they put the album together or their actual ideas behind songs. SO that first dvd was an hour wasted. Hoping for something better I popped in the other DVD, Homework, as it's titled. This one sucked even more. It's interviewing other people who love Radiohead... and once again really has nothing to do with radiohead.Don't waste your time or your money... go out, buy all the radiohead cd's and live performance recording you can and savor the music for yourself... you don't need anyone else to tell you what they think the music says."
3,Didn't take very long,"My kids love these digging kits. Once I saw one you really had to scrape and brush away at, and it was a project that you could work on for 2 hours, and put it away for another day. This kit is fun, however my two boys, ages 5 and 7 had all the pieces dug out in less than 20 minutes. They loved the activity, and the treasures, but I would have liked it to be a little harder."
2,Good for basic objects,Don't buy this product if you are looking for professional photographic results. Many of the objects are repeated and the photographs are not usable. I use it to produce pictures for preschoolers. They don't mine out of focus pictures. I do regret buying this product.
5,Incredible and Classical,"Peter Blanchette's choice of music and the recording are simply awesome. This album is so good, in fact, that I am writing this good review despite the fact that I ordered a guitar transcription of one of the songs and never heard back from him(didn't get it, nor did Mr. Blanchette cash the check). This music is THAT good. Trust me, buy this CD because it is one of the greatest musical works I have come across, but don't bother ordering a transcription when you realize how great the music really is :)."
4,"Good, Functional Power Strip","I got this for my entertainment center and it has sufficient ports to connect all the various devices. It is also heavy enough to stay in place and not get pulled around by the different cables like some of the other surge protection strips I have had. The cord is also long enough (maybe a bit too long) so that placement is not a big issue. There is sufficient spacing to plug in almost 5 power warts and not block any outlets. I have not actually had a surge yet (thankfully), so can't comment on how well it would work in that scenario. It does seem pretty well made."
3,What is this?,"So when I first received and opened this package, i noticed that it was the surge protector wasn't the one in the product description with the four transformers on one side, but it was the one in the Amazon image with 2 transformers on each side. That wasn't really a big problem, but I was hoping for the one in the product description. I mainly purchased this because I liked the overload protection feature since there's hasn't really been a surge here. I tested the the Tripp Lite's overload protection by using 2 hairdryers on high and a vacuum cleaner for 5 seconds and sure enough, the house circuit breaker tripped instead of the Tripp Lite. That disappointed me. Now if you understood why this happened, feel free to leave a comment."
3,"Great game,for awhile.","I have had this game for some time and I still think is OK.It gets boring way to fast.The mini games are fun,but some what frustrating.Whenever you get to the show,the songs sound nothing like the guys songs.The graphics are really bad sometimes.This should have been on GBA.For a great game,try BRITNEY'S DANCE BEAT."
1,Product will kill your child!!!!!!!!!,"Length:: 0:29 MinsThe model # on my nitelight is 71055A and looks a bit different than in this photo, but on mine the top comes off to expose electrodes! My 8 month old did this and we found the base plugged in with the electrodes sticking up!!! Make sure you don't have the kind I do."
5,One that slipped through the cracks,"Great album that seems to be off the radar for no good reason. He's got a soulful, distinctive voice and a great backup band. Can't ask for more. Every time I put this CD on I'm struck by how it holds up, and it's already over 10 years since its release. Where is this guy now?"
4,"Good Fan, Great service","Pretty simple fan and installation. I don't think these have changed much in 50 years. I put mine in the garage for occasional fume venting, especially in winter or when it's really hot. It's not the industrial strength I would have liked, but I didn't want to spend a lot or make a bigger hole in the wall.After 8 months and only about 20 uses, the motor died. I called Broan, got a pleasant customer service rep immediately on the line. He asked for my name and address, and is sending a new motor right away. No hassle, no sending proof of purchase, just respectful, friendly service.Good job, Broan!"
4,Surviving Our Parents' Mistakes,I used this for a Psych course and my final project. I had to portray how I would assist with rewriting negtive scripts formed during childhood. I found this book and others that I purchased very helpful. I earned an A+ on my work.
1,Do not buy!!,"The necklace was not as nice as the picture. The sound is cheep and barley audible! This is supposed to be heard by the unborn baby. I could barely hear it myself, how is the baby suppose to hear it?? I have heard better chimes from an infant toy. I tried to return it, but the time frame to return it was so short that I missed it. Now I have a necklace that I wouldn't even give way."
2,"PBS documentary much, much better","The documentary is stale and more of a human interest story for modern times than about the ""Holiest Sites."" It follows three families from a Christian, Jewish and Muslim background, but spends a good deal more time following the families around than highlighting the sites for which the city is famous. Also, I get a sense that several of the scholars are fringe and nuttier than most. The title should have been, ""Three worlds collide: Jerusalem"" or something like that - it's simply NOT about the Holiest sites.My suspicions were confirmed after watching the PBS documentary which has outstanding footage, detailed history, and states the events more matter-of-fact, avoiding political controversy."
5,Gun works great,Kind of hard to cock it back for a two and four year old which is good because they cannot shoot me with them. This should prepare them well for when they do drive-by's when they get older. jk
1,Astonishingly bad.,"Gun jams constantly. The Maverick only fires occasionally when the conditions are perfect and it's in a good mood. It has gotten me killed in many a nerf battle due to its astounding lack of reliability. Also doesn't pack much of a punch either. The second I got it I took it out the package and immediately shot my cat in the face with it. He just blinked, yawned and went back to sleep. I mean, I didn't expect his head to explode or anything, but c'mon."
3,Price has doubled in past week,"I put two of these in my shopping cart on one day two weeks ago at $9+ and the next day got a notice that the price had gone up to over $10, so I removed them. Today the price is over $20! How does this happen? Toy'R'Us has them for about half that price.Nerf N-Strike Maverick"
3,Overpriced and longer-than-expected shipping,"Hi guys! This gun is fun, but it's easier to just go pick it up from any local (insert major retailer) where it is ~$10. The shipping was a bit slow on mine, not a deal-breaker, but IMO only buy this gun from Amazon.com if it is super cheap, like ~$5. Otherwise, you'll be waiting around while you could be having fun for the same price and a 20 minute trip to the local store."
5,One of my favorites,"I've got quite a few nerf guns and this is ones of my favorites. It's powerful, compact, and doesn't jam like many others. With a cheap price tag and hasbro support, you can't go wrong."
2,the bullet is missing,"the bullet is missing&#65292;there is only 3 bullets left&#12290;it's hard to use&#65292; sometimes it didn't work,my boy didn't like it,this Teach me a lesson&#12290;"
5,Nephew loves it,"This was part of my nephew's Christmas gift, he loved it! He opened it up immediately and begin shooting. It's high powered enough to get some distance but low enough that he won't hurt anybody."
4,They are fun..,"We bought four in total... 2 on amazon and 2 from the store in the chirstmas time sales..Sometimes when your shooting the holes dont line up right so the dart dont come out, but when they do line up right, they are tons of fun!When it dont, all you gotta do is open the part where you load the darts and spin it and close again and most the time it will start working again..."
4,Dorm Raider,"I bought two of these, one for my boyfriend and one for me. We had an epic battle the first day we had them, but we still use them on occasion. They also help give people something to do when they come to your room. Plus I have used them to attack other people on our floors. They just added a lot of fun to dorm life. The problem is sometimes they jam. It always seems to happen as you have someone corner and it's your last bullet. If you wait a few seconds before firing after cocking the gun, it usually doesn't jam, but if you do rapid fire, I can promise it will jam."
4,A okay main weapon an awsome side arm,"I got this gun a long time a go (well actualy I got 3)and only one broke so it's quite durable but to avoid it breaking you have to do the following: 1.you'll notice that if you just barly push the triger it will move with no resistance at all, dont hold the trigar like this for any amount of time 2.dont make the barel revolve without pulling the triger over all its a great buy and not to expensive I would recomend it for a new nerfer."
2,Looks cool but is disappointing,"I am 8. This gun is disappointing because it always jams. I read the reviews and they said that the darts would shoot 35 feet, but they don't. Also, it hurts your hand because of the cocking action. The aim is bad. This was my birthday present so I am sad. Usually I like nerf guns."
3,Solid with flaws,"It's a good gun for starters and those with smaller hands. The draws backs are that you have to cock the gun for every shot , that requires both hands. It only has 6 shots and is hard to reload in a hurry. You can mod this gun to make it an bit easier to reload if your situation allows this. It's good but it jams and you often have to pull the trigger twice."
4,Good Gun...Just Don't Drop It.,"I got this gun about two years ago and it worked great then. It fired at 2 darts per second (I have a fast hand) filling the sliding glass door with darts in 6 seconds :). I really like the feature where you push the button and the barrel pops out, very conveinent and cool. My big problem with it is that if you drop it every once in a while, which adds up overtime, the gun becomes unreliable. 60% of the time, it fires, and 40% it doesn't. Let's review:Pros:1. Great fapid fire action2. Good dart reload system3. Shoots about 30 feet max.Cons:1. Paint comes off overtime2. Becomes unreliable overtimeSo overall, good gun, just don't expect to make it last a lifetime."
3,great gun for battles,"My friend bought this gun and it works great. His dad loves it. It's really fun, and it's good at rapid fire. The NERF Rapid Fire 20 is much faster and better, but more expensive, too. You have to pull back on the top and press the trigger, and keep doing that. It sounds like it takes a while, but it actually fires pretty quick. I'm pretty sure it comes with 8 darts."
2,Nerf N-Strike Maverick,This Nerf gun is a good idea BUT the Nerf 'bullets' jam in the gun all the time. My sons could not fire a full round of six without one or more jamming.
3,Maverick a fast firing non-semi auto or full auto gun,I've seen a lot of reviews saying it is a semi auto gun whitch is totally wrong. A semi auto gun can fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. An assault rifle is full auto whitch this is not. This gun is good if you want to fire at close ranges and don't have to worry about accuracy. Get the Nightfinder instead it has a laser sight to help you aim it can go farther and is more accurate. The maverick is good for a last ditch effort and your being swarmed.
5,Great fun,"Got this for my son (read as myself) and it's great fun. Really satisfying shape/size and great fun to shoot. It's a Nerf gun, it's not going to win any awards for accuracy or range, but for shooting foam suction darts around the house or in the yard it's great."
3,Shatner-rap Rocks!,"I am not a trekkie, and I want to say that I love this movie. The song ""Bill"" sings at the end is great, and is called ""No Tears For Caesar"". Also, during the credits a great song called ""Satellite"" is sung by Lauren Christy. On the soundtrack I think it is the untitled song at the end, but I don't actually have the soundtrack. I was still able to rate the CD because of seeing the movie and knowing what the songs are by the credits at the end. Satellite is too good a song not to name it and give Lauren Christy credit for it."
4,Easy read,This was another great read by Diane Chamberlain. I haven't yet read a book I didn't enjoy by her. Loved it
1,Found the Right Filter,"I was skeptical about ALL of the filters I found here. I went to the official Shark site and found what I needed there, BUT $12.95 per filter seemed like a lot. Eventually, after not finding elsewhere, I broke down and paid $12.95. It turned out it was $12.95 for THREE filters. I recommend finding the Shark site."
2,Minimum requirement: SuperComputer to make this product run.,"Advertised 25% faster.. OMG! If it was any slower it would be stopped. I made a mistake with my G4 1 gig Powerbook of installing just 128 megs of ram on my first install due to I only had 512 megs of physical ram. Not even worth running.. even Solitaire runs like a dog. So I upped my laptop to a full gig & made 512 ram available to my next XP install thinking ""problem solved"". No difference, No exaggeration.. slow slow slow.To be honest, if it ran at a good or even acceptable level.. it would be really nice. It is very easy to configure, the support is great: sound, nic, video configuration all works very well.Very Very pricey tho, prolly need a dual G5 to bring it up to an acceptable level."
2,Not a good read from a usually great writer,"I have been a Tarr fan since I was about 14 years old. I have read most of her fantasy series and her historical novels. So when I saw this one, I grabbed it. Sadly, this book is very dissappointing. It is so lacking in freshness and originality that I was bored to senselessness. I found myself skipping pages and pages in this book. It felt like it would never end. And by the way, skipping those pages did not detract from this slow moving tale at all. The characters are all people you have met before in other of her works and better portrayed. It is hard to say exactly what is it that makes this book so poor except to say that in reading it you definately have a feeling of ""been there, done that"". I felt as if the author was sleep walking thru this one-- doing it to satisfy a contract or something. If you are a Tarr fan, this is one book that you can skip. I have faith that she will be better next time."
3,Glow necklaces,"This was the best deal I could find for glow necklaces (50 for $28 s/h included). I bought it for my children as part of their Halloween costumes. However, some of the necklaces, mainly the orange ones, did not glow entirely. Half of the necklace lit up while the other half was dead. But I guess you get what you pay for. All in all, it served it's purpose and I got double the amount of glow necklaces for the price I would have paid locally for 25. I still have some left over for birthday party treats."
2,The ones that work are great!,"In our tube of glow necklaces, there were quite a few that only lit up about half of the necklace. But the company was kind enough to send a new tube out for us quickly. The ones that worked were a lot of fun, and were pretty bright."
2,"22"" Lumistick Brand Glowsticks","I purchased 6 tubes of these (300 each) for a fundraiser at our Middle School Dance. Imagine my surprise when 2 tubes were opened already when I opened in the box and broken!!! I am assuming it was a shipping problem, at least I hope!!!"
1,Bad Seat!!!,The seat on this bike is not angled properly. You child's rear will slide off the back when they try to peddle. We took it to a bike shop but we couldn't even find a replacement seat that would work with the non-standard diameter of the seat post. Definitely not worth the $$$.
4,Lion King II,"Its a fun game, but my only complaint was the songs that the animals sing are not the songs from the movie. I would of preferred to have the choice to listen to the orginal songs. It lacks in variety slightly. Better than average, but not one of the best. Works on XP"
4,PLEASANT FLORAL,"The fragrance is very nice, but not much vanilla. It's inoffensive enough for everyday wear and any occasion, though. Musky floral about sums it up. I'm glad I got the half-ounce sample, but would probably not rebuy."
1,Turn the other way and run!!!,"I have dealt with a lot of poor products in my lifetime, and poor customer service but Lexmark's X125 is the worst. I purchased it off of Dell's website with my new computer and have never been able to get it to work (even with customer support on the phone) They have sent me 2 new printers (Along with the new one 1 bought) and each one has a different fatal problem. Lexmark makes it nearly impossible to get in touch with customer support and when they do finally diagnose your problem (If you can understand your customer support person) as a faulty printer they send you a RE-FURBISHED printer (1 printer had crumbs in the display)Pathetic!Read the other reviews for the Lexmark X125, this is a lousy product!"
2,It's a 3D game........ but not a cool one !!,"This game is a good game game but it lets go of its intrest very easily because almost each level has the same game elements, such as: Same Creatures you have to kill and Same Missions (find a security card), its fun for the first 5 min. but then you find out that all the levels are almost the same and it makes you mad. This game features a password feature which is not COOL, but if you like 1st person shooters I suggest DOOM orECKS VS. SERVER or just wait for DOOM 2 or ECKS VS.SERVER 2."
1,Return to sender!,"I bought this because I LOVE Doom, Wolfenstien, and other first person shooters...At least those WORK.I contacted the company when my guy froze, and got killed when he froze. They knew about it...couldn't fix it.BAD graphics, even poorer sound! My sister, who can usually figure out a game tried this thing....no such luck, the game kept freezing.There is no excuse for a game freeze, and al I can say is...AVOID THIS GAME! GET DOOM! GET WOLFENSTIEN!Now if only someone could put out Marathon for GBA!"
4,Devon's back!,I think that this is a good book. I really like how they brought back someone from Sweet Valley High series. Devon was my favorite guy character during High series. He is so much better than Todd or course any guy is better than Todd. I hope Sam's Diary is as good or better.
5,Finally a wallet that holds everything!,"I looked all over, for a wallet that can hold all of my credit cards. This product fits the bill, It is a good looking wallet that that is sturdy and holds credit cards, driver's liscense, currency and checks.It fits in pockets nicely."
3,Could be better,"This wallet replaced another I had for many years that was finally following apart.It is GREAT for holding credit cards. However, there should be a zipper pouch for change and one or two additional compartments for receipts etc.I honestly could not find anything to match the previous ""man purse"" and hope this company will make theirs better."
2,Credit cards don't fit,"This product had great potential, but it was ruined because the slots for the credit cards are too narrow! It becomes a real struggle to insert the credit cards. I sometimes have to bend the cards to get them to fit in ... not good."
2,Very tight fit for cards and mediocre quality,I purchased this to organize credit and gift cards. It is a very tight fit for std size gift and credit cards. The tight fit is required as each slot is holds the card in place with just friction since they have no bottoms and the card can slide in too deep. There was also an additional plastic card holder that is so flimsy it tears whenever you try to insert a card. The material is thin and feels like it will soon tear around the cards especially given the tight fit.
1,Waste of money,None of my credit cards will fit into any of the slots as they are all way too small. It looks like the entire thing was sewn incorrectly. Total waste of my money.
4,"Quality, Value, and Convienience","I usually purchase the Jalapeno version of these chips but decided to try the regular salted style. The same as the Jalapeno, these have the right amount of salt with good flavor. My favorite thing about this brand of chips is that it is readily available at a great price from Amazon, and if your an Amazon Prime member it will arrive free of charge within 2 days of ordering it. These chips are Euro style which means they are more crunchy and seem to be in pieces rather than large whole chips. If that doesn't bother you, and you prefer individual serving size, this is about the best value you can buy. $10.73 for 28 1.5 oz bags. No Tax, No shipping if your Amazon Prime. If you like spicy, try the Jalapeno. You won't be sorry."
1,"Wieniawski, Henryk","Henryk Wieniawski was a great Polish composer. How would you feel I somebody will call for example Mark Twain a Canadian or Mexican writer. Sincerely, Magdalena Melamed New York, NY USA"
3,Missing data,The Moon Sign data in this book only goes up to 2001. I just purchased this book (January 2004) so it was missing much of the information I was interested in. Not a good buy.
4,Nail biter . . .,"This 85-minute thriller ramps up the tension from the first frame and doesn't take off the pressure for a second. Lorraine Stanley is terrific as a London prostitute who gets involved in some nasty business involving a runaway girl and a wealthy client. The following day, on the run to Brighton, with her pimp in hot pursuit, she tries to scrape up the cash to put the girl on a train to Devon.Events, crammed into a single day, move much too fast finally for everybody, and two graves dug in the night are eventually occupied by the fated victims, though not until after the suspense has been drawn out to the breaking point. Photography and editing are as fine as the performances of the cast, and the music track is especially haunting. Rarely has the Moonlight Sonata been used in a film to underscore such a darkly grim sense of foreboding. A real nail-biter."
2,didn't like it,"There are cool pictures and all but seriously you cannot cover the whole egyptian, etruscan, greek...periods in 3-4 pages. The book plainly describes what people were wearing in these periods (and it does not give you the complete info) and it does not tell you much about the story behind these costumes which I found pretty lame."
1,One of the worst I've ever seen,"The information is just plain wrong in hundreds of instances and the images and text are frequently not connected. In general if a book says it is a Complete History of Costume from the dawn of time to yesterday, it is probably to be avoided, but this one is truly, truly bad!"
1,poor quality,"This filter was not heavily used and was not abused and just fell apart on me one day when I was removing it from the lens. I had it only about a half of a year. The pictures did come out well with it, but for the cost and the amount of time it will work- just not worth it. Obviously, there are many people having the same problem."
1,Poorly Made,"The first filter fell out of the frame when I opened the case. I returned it, with no problem and no cost, and the second one also fell apart upon opening the case. I also returned it, and received a full refund from the vendor, who acknowledged that they had to replace a number of these for the same problem.Poor quality item, don't buy one...."
4,Hasn't broken for me,I am using this filter with my tonika 12-24 lens on my Nikon D60 camera. This lens vignettes just a tiny bit on this lens when racked out to 12mm.I have had the issue mentioned by several others with the filter self-destructing.
3,Life's Game,"Hasbro has made it quite a status to make virtual versions of their classic board games for the P.C. Yet, they are quite amazing, but not always in what they seem to be. The Game Of Life is really no acception. The Milton Bradley classic has done very well alone, but as a computer game, it is quite amazing. The Game of Life plays just like the original board game, as you go through the stages of life, trying to get the most money, and retiring the winner. Yet, while the game is good in the graphics, and the gameplay, the music, and the feeling of the game isn't as wholesome. Somehow, the board game itself when you're playing against someone else is a little better than playing it alone on the computer. But, if you don't have it as a board game, this makes a great game for the computer.Graphics: BSound: CFun & Enjoyment: C 1/2+: B if you're playing against somebody else besides the computerOverall: C+"
1,life game,when i received the game it did not work. i emailed the company i got it from twice and i never received an answer
4,Good to see the original,"For those who are fans of the American version, this may not really interest you. For those who are addicted to the British version, this is really worth investing in. While there are certainly some less-than-stellar moments, it is wonderful to see the show in it's most raw form and see it progress across the first season and into the second. This collection also features many games that were later scrapped like ""Authors"" which are exceedingly funny and far more intelligent than later episodes.For the price, you can't miss. Also -- the packaging is marvelous and compact as opposed to a bundle of standard clunky large DVD cases. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out so I can add them to my collection!"
3,If you don't like John Sessions then walk away,"I started watching Whose Line years ago when the British version was rerunned on Comedy Central, little did I know that the majority of those hilarious episodes were not pulled from the first 2 seasons. Ryan Stiles is little to be seen and the first season heavily features a guy named John Sessions who is an arrogant prat - he thinks he's great and almost never follows the storyline and watching him do Party Quirks is just painful. With the exception of the ghastly 80's attire, I have always preferred the British version until I saw John Sessions. Be warned, these may not be the Whose Line you loved and thought you knew"
2,It broke the first time!,"I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter for Christmas, today she and her friend decided to use it for the first time, after about three minutes the top opened and thinking it was one my daughter reached for one of the charms, she got burnt. For some reason ours will not stay latched, you have to hold it down to make it go through the entire cycle. I thought this would be a great toy but am really disappointed in it. Roseart has really gone down in quality the last few years."
1,useless,this unit was DOA completely useless But Amazon's return policy is wonderfull. I'm greatful for that. Mike in No. CA.
3,"Good as a headphone jack replacement, but weak audio","I bought this to use as a second audio along with DJ software. DJay detected it but Traktor didn't seem to, not sure if that was user error. My big problem, however, was that the audio it pushes is nowhere near loud enough for a club environment. The audio is adequate under normal volumes. The physical casing is a little weak as well, the plastic is prone to open at the seams, and I had to tape one together. The flashing light can also be annoying.I give it 3 stars because I've gotten some good use out of it, and it's worth the $2 I paid. Even the one I had to tape together seems to be working without any ""handle jiggling"" tricks. It's probably a 2.5 star purchase in reality because I couldn't in good conscience recommend it to anyone except for someone with a broken headphone jack desperate to hear their music again."
1,****Don't buy****,"Worked great... for about three minutes, then never again.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy.Don't buy."
4,Works fine,"When I first plugged it in the sound was off - echoed or tinny sounding - but I reseated it and that went away. The blinking light is annoying. Cheap plastic, but as long as it works it's fine with me. I got what I paid for."
2,Fine while it worked,"I bought it for my brother's laptop that had a short in the audio port. He used it three weeks before it snapped off. It's cheap and I suggest that it's used as a temporary measure until the port gets fixed or a better sounding and constructed audio device can be purchased. So, buy several as backups or spend more money and get a sturdier usb audio interface. The audio was okay and better than nothing is what my brother said.You get the quality you pay for. So three stars for the sound and two stars due to its flimsy, cheap plastic construction. That's an average of 2 1/2 stars."
5,Great product--works well,This product works really great. The audio quality is excellent. My new Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook doesn't support a microphone input for my headset--this product helps me overcome the problem really effectively.
1,non-functioning,"I bought two of these--one for my daughter and one for myself, since both of us have laptops with broken headphone jacks. The cheap price should have scared me off, but I went for it anyway, and they both quit working in about two weeks. They were too cheap to return, so I just tossed them. Another reason why we need to make things in the U.S. again."
1,Couldn't make it work,"Save your money!! Not that it cost much, but still! Tried 8 or 9 settings in my PC but it just wouldn't work!"
2,"Okay for listening, not for recording","I wanted this for both listening and mic usage. For simply listening, its okay, but for use with the mic it is unacceptable. It creates a dreadful amount of high pitched noise. I've tried a variety of configurations but so far without success."
2,External 5.1 USB 3D Audio Sound Card Adapter for PC Desktop Notebook Laptop,"Eh, you get what you pay for with this 1. It works, and I suppose you could say it works well, just not as up to par as what I'd hoped. Wishful thinking, next time I'll spend more."
1,Flimsy & broken,"My sound card died so I thought this would be a quick fix. I knew it wasn't going to be the best thing, but figured it wouldn't be too bad since I'm only paying a buck or two for it. Needless to say, you get what you pay for. This product is flimsy and cheap! It worked for a week before breaking. However, before it broke, it worked OK. Windows 7 recognized it and installed the proper drivers instantly/automatically. The sound quality wasn't spectacular and just OK. If you're in a bind, it may work. Just don't expect it to last."
5,Plug and Play easy!,I bought this item to use with my son's Play Station 2. I was hoping to avoid paying the higher cost for a USB headset since he's so rough on them. Sadly it did not work with the Play Station but it worked perfectly when I plugged it into my computer. I just plugged it in right out of the box and it worked fine. No drivers or setup needed. Not sure why it didn't work with the Play Station but it didn't. I would recommend this item for use with a computer.
1,Ittty Bitttty Case,"Looks great in pictures, but it is very tiny. If you have a tiny camera this is the case for you."
4,Sega Genesis 6 Pak,"This is a great 6-game pack for the Sega Genesis. The 6 games included (on 1 cartridge) are Sonic the Hedgehog, Streets of Rage, Super Hang-On, Columns, Golden Axe, and Revenge of the Shinobi. All are worth at least 1 play."
2,everything good except it takes to long to LOAD.,every crash bandicoot has been awesome exept the one cause it takes so long to load. it practically loads to get to the loading screen. it is awful. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is cause the graphics and the game play. i was really happy when the came out with a new crash WHICH WAS AN ADVENTURE GAME UNLIKE CRASH BASH AND CRASH RACING. and since it was for PS2. i thought it would be incredible. why the heck the does it take so long to load. this is the 21st century and it is loading slower then sega saturn. dont get this game above all. it gets very tedious and boring.ps. get TONY HAWK 3 that takes almost no time to load and it is FUN AS THE 3RD 2ND AND 1ST CRASH BANDICOOT. (if not more fun.)
3,The Game Itself Is Not Right,What Happened To Naughty Dog? They made good Crash Bandicoot games.Why did they let another company do it? I hope they put Naughty Dog in charge of Crash games again.
4,Coco Can't Jump,If you liked Crash Bandicoot Warped or Crash Bandicoot 1 or 2...this is for you. This is typical Bandicoot...just do it until you get it right.This is probably last of the original style. Things change with Twinsanity and Mind Over Mutant.
5,Loading Time - So What?,"I really don't understand the comments of others who gave the game only one or two stars only because of the loading times. I don't think that the loading times are too long. Maybe 20 - 30 seconds at most, but never one minute!Then, the enemies at the end on each stage (like Crush or Neo Cortex) are never too hard. Some are even very easy! One just has to think a little how to handle them, and that's what I like.The game is pure innovation and all levels are created in a great graphic.The only thing I don't understand is that the booklet is grey on the inside and not colored. Did they not have the money for that anymore?All in all, it's a very good sequel to earlier games with several improvements, as other comments already stated (new vehicles, better graphic, a new character to play, new kinds of objects,...).A little bit more innovation wouldn't have been bad, however. That's why I give the game 4 points in fun.For a Bandicoot-Fan, like me, it's like perfect."
3,Crash's game crash,"How could any one think crash fans would go so low to buy a game like this.First of all, the very first boss ( a cortex made bandacoo called Crunch ) is almost impossible to beat. Rolling is one of the hardest moves to acomplish. The rocks move the opposite way, just miss you, and when there on fire they hurt you.Next, the levels are just too hard. Example: level twos flying on a bug game, its almost impossible to do. If u die you have to start all over, its too fustrating.I think the true fans of the crash series will have a blast with this new release. With new level types and a few new boss masks, its sure to please the dyehard fans.For those new to the crash legacy, should avoid it. The controls for the vehicals are to complacated. The story line moves too fast, and the loading/save screen is impossible to acess.But it does have a mute bandacoot, and that has to be worth something.So this games gets a 3 outta 5"
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
3,Crash Bandicoot Wrath of the lodading screens,"i like the gameplay of this game but the loading time is horrible. the loading screens are from forty to fifty seconds long each or more. it is basically the same as crash warped. if you want a crash game, get crash 5 warped for the playstation. it is just as good. without the loading screens."
4,"If you played one Crash game, you've played them all.","If you've liked the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you'll like this one. The gameplay is exactly the same, just different levels. Crash Bandicoot was the first game I bought for the original Playstation years ago and The Wrath of Cortex was the first game I bought for my PS2. The only thing I did not like about this game was the horribly long loading times."
1,So Dissapointed.....,"Let's first say I am the Crash Fan of a lifetime. I've beaten every Crash game that has come out. I was so excited to get PS2 for Christmas that I could hardly wait to play Crash, that is until I loaded it. ***BIG DISSAPOINTMENT*** Aside from everyone's biggest complaint the load time, this is NOTHING like the previous Crash games. The character's are not even the same, the graphics are lousy too. I can't believe that Naugty Dog passed on the opportunity to development this game. You can't possibly expect Traveller's Tales to even come close to the brilliance of Daughty Dog. I did get Jak and Daxter THANK GOODNESS because that is the replacment for Crash and it's a awesome game! Crash fans don't even waste your money on this game buy something else!"
2,The Worst Crash Bandicoot Game,This Game was terrible. The only new thing about this game was that Coco was fully playable but you don't get to play as her very often anyway.Here's an overall view of the game:The Positives:-Good Graphics-Good Bosses-New VehiclesThe Negatives:-Sucky Levels!-Sucky Music-It takes about a hour to load-The Game is extremly hardI heard there is a new Crash coming out later this year. All I can say is that I hope it will be good.
4,what has happened to naughty dogs?????????,this isnt the same old crash!!!!!!!!!!!what is konami doing with crash??????????im very sad to rate a crash bandicoot game 4 stars but i would rate it 3. it isnt the same controllers but if you are a big fan of crash like me you would notice the differences!!!!!!!!!!!ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF CRASH...im very disapointed with the transfer of crash to konami...
3,CRASH,"THE SAME AS THE LAST GAME.ONE THING THAT IS DIFFERNT,ARE THE LEVELS. MORE DIFFICULT AND EXCITING!IF YOU ARE A CRASH FAN, YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME."
2,Disappointed,"The new Crash game was well anticipated, but I can't believe the time wasted ""Loading"" between every function. I would love to access the hidden puzzles, etc, but waiting for it to ""Load"" is very frustrating."
2,Crash Bandicoot isn't like it used to be.,The loading times are way to long and it doesn't play like it used to. Where's Naughty Dog? The bosses are way to hard.
5,BEST GAME OF YHE YEAR!,"The loading times dont take long to me.every one lied the loading times only take 20 seconds.every one wrote blah blah blah the loading times take forever.well they dont trust me they dont.anyway what happens in this game uka uka is mad at cortex the rest of the evil gang.but cortex comes up with an evil plan and its up to crash to save the day.the chacatars in this game are crash,coco,aku aku,pura,cortex,uka uka,n.gin,n.tropy,crunch,tiny tiger,dingodile,the elamentals masks called rok-ko,wa-wa,py-ro,and lo-lo.the only bosses in this game are crunch the elamentals masks.there are five warp rooms.the levels are really cool there are levels about riding a jeep,being chased by a dragon,controling a robot,controling a submraine,coco being chased by water,rolling in ball,and lots of other cool levels.BUY THIS GAME IT IS FUN!"
5,I Think For Sure I LOVE IT!,"I also first heard of N'Dambi on Erykah's Live CD. I absolutely loved her voice and had to pick this CD up when Amazon recommended it. I am absolutely pleased with this CD.N'Dambi's voice is beautiful, soulful...she does things with it that are amazing. She doesn't compare to Erykah in style or sound, which is GREAT - they're definitely different, so don't expect Erykah's sound here. This CD is more jazzy...nice and mellow. Deep bass lines, good grooves...It plays very well all the way through. No pesky unwanted interludes to break the mood.Favorite tracks:* Soul from the Abyss* Deep* Lonely Woman* I Think for Sure* The MeetingPick this CD up. Money should not be an issue. It's too wonderful to pass up.Happy listening!"
2,Overrated?,"I'm going to get some bad feedback for this review, but here's my alternative opinion.This game is really boring. Looks lovely, moves like a tiger on vaseline and I do dig that Matrix style ""hang in mid-air doing the John Woo"" thing, but there's nothing much to do apart from batter the cr*p out the same dull enemies. There are a few combos but a game has to offer more than just fingertip yoga to keep me interested.In a word, vacant - big on style, but no substance, and certainly doesn't sit on the shelf with anything in the Resident Evil series, which actually have a plot and a few good shocks. Maybe if I had no attention span I'd like it better. Great game if you think Blade 2 is a better film than say, Near Dark."
3,worth the camera problems,I loved this game. great graphics w/story but the fact that you can't look around to see where your going or what might be around you really stinks. The camera angle is preset to do whatever it wants not always what the player wants
4,Great game,"When I first went over to my friend's house after he got back from his vacation, he was preaching about this game. So I tried it. Let me say, it is awesome. The weapons are great. Ebony and Ivory, Dante's pistols, shoot insanely fast. The Shotgun is powerful but obviously slow loading. Those are the only weapons I know since I'm only on Mission 6(one of my gripes, the Missions instead of being able to roam free). The swords are pretty cool. Once I got my first new sword, I fell in love. But, the bosses are kinda easy. When I fought the giant spider both times, all I had to do was Devil Trigger and hit him a few times with my sword. But, I still recommend it."
1,This Game Blows,"Dont buy this game. It is full of a horrible game play. There is no story. The graphics make me sick becuse they look like a Picasso drawing that has violenty mutated and are currently attacking their loving master. VOMIT. Dont buy this game, save your money and use it to but something that looks good as it jiggles."
1,worst game - even worse service,"do not buy this game, specifically not from Quick Buys. The worst service I got EVER."
4,gift,"This was actually a gift for a friend of mine but he says that the games are awesome, so i will go with that."
4,WOW,"I really enjoyed this game, it had good play sequences and a pretty good story, truly amazing grahics and action and best of all - a 3D environment (for the most part). It was really fun. I kept it after finishing and will play it again."
2,Just OK,"The movie intro suggests a better game than it really is. The music is good on a surround sound system.Pros - the sound quality is good, the medival essence with swords and socery, and you never run out of ammo.Cons - The balance of the game. You have to solve puzzles, but the description of each is vague. One enemy is strong and the next very week. It takes a few days just to learn how to control your character.Overall- 2 thumbs down ..."
4,Excellent Game... Needs more Content,"I had played this game at Software Ect. and I knew I had to have it. One of the best gaming purchases I made all year. Graphics are excellent and the gameplay is stable and easy for all people. The story is excellent and the voice acting is actually above par except for a few spots. There is only one problem holding this game back from a full 5 stars... it is way too short! I beat the game in only about 4 hours on normal mode. The game consists of a set amount of missions and they tend to average about 8 minutes per mission going up to 22 missions. Replayability is decent though because there are different difficulty modes with some hidden stuff later on. All in all, if your looking for a quick fix with a good game, go with Devil May Cry. If your looking for a game that will take you hours upon hours to beat, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD TO READ BLACK AND WHITE ETC.,"The common link to humanity can be found in it's content. Everyone needs and deserves to have ""truth"", and an open mind."
2,Just because it isn't European doesn't mean that it's African,"The Bible's origins (for the most part) comes from the Middle East, primarily Asia Minor. If you take the text LITERALLY, you recognize that the Israelites (the word ""Jews"" literally means someone from the Tribe of Judah) were a Semitic people of Syrian origins. The Bible also makes it clear that some of the narrative takes place in Egypt as well. It is mainly a tale involving people of color. But the people of color are brown, not black.I do not doubt the universality of the stories. Many similar tales come from Mesopotamian literature as well as the Greek myths. And given that Adam and Eve came FAR more likely from Kenya that Iraq, close ties to parts of Africa are inevitable. But I find a hard time buying the book's central premise."
3,Emma Shapplin,"Although much of Emma Shapplin's beautiful songs are on the album, something is lost in a ""live"" recording."
3,Yet another charging/battery issue for the sanyo 8200,"I have had my 8200 for a little more than a year, and generally I liked it, but after owning it for about 6 months, I started having problems keeping it charged. The charge wouldn't hold at all, and the phone would say the charging was complete when it couldn't even power up. I went to Sprint for help, but after three hours of diagnostic testing, the store manager gave it back to me and said there was nothing wrong with it! She said I was to go buy a ANOTHER charger (to the tune of $50) and that would solve the problem. It did for a while, but after another couple of months it is happening again. I will be heading to the Sprint store this morning on the off chance that they will care. I went last night, but I discovered when I got there that they now close at 6:00 pm instead of 8:00 pm. Thanks for the @*%#$!+ support, Sprint!"
2,Disappointed,"I've had my phone for a little over a year. It gradually stopped taking charge from the pin charger that came with the phone, and would say it was full when the battery was completely empty! It would beep to charge and then uncharge and at first it was ok, but it got so bad that it stopped charging at all! I also have problems with redialing and calls being forwarded straight to voicemail and way too many lost calls. The phone gets hot when talking on it for more than 20 minutes and it takes 2 minutes to open text messages and another few minutes to send them. Half the time my friends don't even get the text messages I send, esp. if it is a reply message! I have been to the Sprint Store only to be told that the phone is not defective if the other charging port works! They tried to sell me the other type of charger, instead of using insurance exchange program... Very disappointed with phone and service!!!"
5,Best episode yet this season!!!,While watching the interactions between Howard and his father-in-law were just ok; Amy and Sheldon were just hilarious and I can't wait to see how this will progress.
5,big bang theory,"these are terrific, i will keep the in cloud forever and let all my friends see them when they need cheering up"
3,Its ok,"It works if you only use it for a 2 cup sifter. More than that and it seems to stick. Not worth returning, it does work, Just need to use a little at a time."
3,"great adivce, unfortunately doesn't play","The advice and suggestions on this DVD are great.Unfortunately, it only plays on my laptop. Something about the formatting won't allow it to play on any of the regular DVD players in my house. You can get the audio but the picture skips all over the place. I'm not a 100% sure what the problem is.However--the substance and content of this DVD are really worth looking at. Just be prepared you may not be able to play it on your TV."
5,Avery 5796 removable see-through dots,"This is a difficult to find product. It is wonderful to be able to see through and remove these dots without damaging the paper. Used for homework; studies; teaching, etc. Great!"
1,Laibach - Ljubljana Zagreb Beograd,"I like Laibach, I really do, but this CD is abysmal, nearly unlistenable. I was grinding my teeth trying to get through this awful thing! Seriously, I could not stand this release, if I wasn't a completist it would be gone in a heartbeat. It's just noise, and not the good kind. Think Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"", but not at all interesting and very much annoying. I'm getting a headache just thinking about it..."
3,"Works great, until it started squealing","I bought this for use with my guitar amp to cut out some of the noise on the line. It worked great for about three months and then one day when I got home it was emitting a loud squealing noise, I assume as a surge warning or something. I unplugged the device from the wall and looked all over it for a reset button (there isn't one), and tried plugging it back in after a couple of hours to no avail. I have other Monster surge protectors in the same room on the same circuit, and none of them went off that day (full disclosure that those ones are on the higher end of the spectrum from Monster). Hasn't worked since and now makes for an ugly paperweight."
1,SVU Books Have Sunk Pretty Low...,"I loved the SVH books, as well as most of the SVU books. But since the SVU characters have been in sophomore year, the plots have deteriorated and the new characters, with the exception of Neil, are awful & shallow. Sam's Secret Love Diary is the worst yet, not so much the writing as that the main character is a slacker/moron. Right away, it's guaranteed that the book is going to be terrible, even just for the reason that the narrator is a guy who's only interest in life seems to be getting another can of beer... Plus the plot is extremely weak, about Sam's new career as a filmmaker with Lila Fowler in his documentary. All this was inspired by a documentary about his favorite bar."
1,BORING!,"This book has got to be one of the most boringest books known to man! I mean seriously! I agree with one of the reviewers above, Sam doesn't seem like the type of person to have a diary. I skipped over some parts because they were boring and I didn't miss anything. Please do NOT waste your time and skip over this book."
3,Hmmm Not really worth it,"The book was ok for the fact that it was a guy shring his feelings about what he was going through living in a house with girls (including a gay guy) The story line was way off base because of him wanting or thinking about getting it together with Lila, just weird, I really hope they pick upi the series it seemsto be doing a waterfall"
4,Almost as interesting as a blank book but ...,"This book is not intended to be ""interesting"" - it is strictly practical. It contains charts of dates and the reference for the Bible passage to be read that day. Plan 1 reads the entire Bible (from a Catholic definition of canon) in 1 year; it aims at 20-30 minutes of reading a day. Plan 2 reads the Bible in two years paralleling the two year weekday lectionary cycle as much as practical; it aims at 10-25 minutes of reading a day. Plan 3 reads the Bible in 3 years; it aims at 5-7 minutes of reading a day.In addition, there is a schedule of readings for Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter - seasonal readings for the liturgical year.In short, a useful book for those wanting a schedule by which to read Scripture."
5,Very Helpful Book,"As a new breast cancer patient, I searched on Amazon for highly recommended books. This one was rated well and I agree with others - definitely worth buying and reading."
5,Nissan sunshade,The sunshade is sturdy and fits well across the entire front window. It sufficiently keeps heat and sun out. I would recommend the product to Nissan Sentra owners.
3,"Does the trick, but NOISY","Used it during Sandy. Tried to run 22"" TV (off Dish). Needed to turn up the volume. Either it overheated (alarm went off) or my inverter battery ran too low to power after 20 mins. Worked fine for plug in lamps as long as one wasn't trying to have a conversation nearby.Certainly good for emergency use."
3,Not sure if its durable,"Got it in the mail today.Opened it up, and the first thing i wanted to see was - if i can remove the fuse (for replacement in the future).It was very hard to pull out (which is fine). But when i did, a piece of solder on the inside of the unit came off.I had to take it apart to find out that the the wires going to the fuse (both ends), were practically crossing,meaning they were not insulted so the terminals were practically touching. In plain words that means that it would fry the unit if the fuse had to blow, but it couldn't - because it would be bypassed. (Um, Fire Hazard???? )Good thing i found out that issue was there, so i wrapped some electrical tape around it to prevent them from touching.Plus i bought it for a trip (tomorrow), so no time to get a new one.So far plugged in phone charger and a 135 W laptop charger for a few minutes, seemed to work - no complaints there.Does make a slight ""electrical noise""."
2,Sounds like a jet engine,"This works, but it sounds like an airplane taxiing along the tarmac. If I press on the gas or turn on the headlights the fan in this thing speeds up or slows down. I knew the fan was loud from reading the reviews, but I didn't think it would bother me because I'm not that sensitive to noise in my car since I listen to my stereo pretty loudly. However, I couldn't stand it and I couldn't find a location in my car where it didn't bother me. I even tried putting it inside the center console (bad idea for ventilation), but it was still too loud. I have no idea why they couldn't have designed this with a quieter fan. Also, it interferes with my stereo so that sometimes the stereo doesn't turn off when I take the keys out of the ignition. I'm returning it and looking for one without a fan."
2,Won't power more than 150 watts,"This unit is rated for 375 watts continuous power, but started giving me an overload alarm with just a 150 watt light bulb plugged in, with the engine running. With 170 watts, the inverter simply shut off. I tried several different appliances and tried the inverter in two cars with different batteries. In both cases, 120 watts worked fine, but anything higher caused problems. Also, the engine had to be running continuously for this to work. Otherwise the inverter turned off within two minutes. Maybe I just got a bad unit, but I was not impressed!"
4,Works,"This serves the purpose. It is in one of the service trucks. No complaints, by the technician. It is a basic unit."
4,"Fan is a little loud, but I knew when ordering","The fan noise is the only thing that keeps this inverter from being five stars. Invaluable when transporting the family on a long trip since it can keep a laptop and DS in business at the same time. I didn't realize how noisy it was until it was turned off. The buzz is noticeable, but I prefer the noise to additional heat or less power."
5,Still Essential Reading,During a time when people are questioning job loss and other effects of technology this book written more than forty years ago is up to the minute and gets the thinking process moving as to where we are with technology.
1,Not to modern standards,"It is hard to believe that this book was written only 40 years ago. The writing is tendentious and florid to the point where I found it unreadable; it is something that I would expect from a 19th-century document. If this book were first published today, no respected viewer would recommend it; it's a period piece. Likewise, the omission of references is no longer acceptable.To be frank, I was unable to get more than partway through the book -- I was not prepared to slog through 1,000 pages with gritted teeth, although I gave it a fair try. This book was a deep disappointment."
4,Great product with one flaw,"This product is everything they advertise, but I ended up returning it. It is true that it goes on clear and does not leave residue on plastic trim, or glass, etc. However because of this feature, it's difficult to know where it was applied and even more difficult when buffing it off. I probably waxed my car one-and-a-half times just to make sure I didn't miss any areas. If you're careful and concentrate one which areas are done & which aren't, this isn't a problem. Personally though, I would rather see a little haze when applying & removing."
2,extremely easy wax for newer vehcile,"Have a newer 2010 chevy silverado 2500HD. I applied first coat about a month ago and a second coat three weeks ago. Truck was bare of wax when i bought it and I noticed i missed some places after the first coat. This wax was extremely easy to apply and buff. I don't think i would work as well as some of the cleaner waxes on an older vehicle, but it looks fantastic on my newer. Would absolutely buy again.Update 2013: stopped using. Does not last, looks good but plan on applying every 3-4 weeks. I went back to traditional pasted. Cannot recommend."
3,Overrated,"Turtle Wax has invested a lot of commercial time for this product. You will pay for that when you purchase it. They have paid people to say that it is better than Maguiars. Maguiar users, don't throw out your Gold Class just yet. Ice applies easily and leaves a nice shine. Not better shine that other products. You don't have to avoid rubber or plastic parts which is nice. It leaves a particularly nice shine on plastic parts but not better than the Maguiars Vynl polish at less than half the price. The residue that ice leaves behind means you will be rubbing endlessly! This is likely due to chemical reaction of products used previously. A clay bar may remove other product before applying Ice. Do not use Ice liquid clay bar unless you want to spend hours getting that pasty mess off your vehicle. I like Maguiars Gold Class for painted surfaces. It's easier to use, more affordable and the shine is as good maybe even better than Ice."
5,Great for older kids,"I got this for my 7 year old. Thought she would love it....but it's a little big too hard for her. However, My son who is 15 and I love it. It's a great game!(for older kids)"
4,Road Rash Rocks!,"If you like the older games and systems you'll love road rash. I have 1,2 and 3 and well, have fun on all of them. It's too bad you can only save sessions on a password and not whole profiles or save your place in a race, but if you love collectible games that are fun to play.. Road Rash series will keep you quite busy.."
4,Interesting look at teen dilemma,"I first read this book in high school, and recently found it again about twelve years later. I thought it was an interesting look at a teen girl dealing with getting pregnant. She has to face the fact that it is really happening, and then decide what she will do. This book was written in the late 60s or very early 70s, so it does mention that abortion was illegal then. Phoebe tries talking to different people who could help her, and at the end she has to tell her boyfriend and parents. The book as a whole is pretty good, but I didn't really like the end, since it doesn't say what happens to Phoebe after everyone finds out."
1,This was the worst book I have ever seen!!,"No point wastuing words on this, the previous line says it al"
3,Disappointed,"The crackers themselves I can't complain about. They're not as salty as many, quite flavorful and crisp. My main complaint is I order them on May 14th and they arrived with a June 16 expiration date! Being as I'm the only one that eats them, I'm keeping my fingers crossed the air tight storage units I put them in, keeps them for a while longer in good condition. That's the main reason I've rated them as a 3."
4,Nice,"Good traditional Christian/Christmas standards sung by gospel singer Vestal Goodman, whose unique powerful voice brings a wonderful sound to these old favorites. Good for people who love gospel music and traditional Christmas music."
3,Cute but would not fit on my crib,"This mobile is very cute and plays a sweet song...I was really excited to find it. I actually got it to go with a Lambie nursery crib set from another store. However, I have a crib with a wide rail at the top (the Babi Italia Carlisle Lifetime crib) and the mobile will not fit on the side. I have seen other lifetime cribs with a similar design, so I just wanted to warn everyone that this mobile may not work. I am going to have to return it for this reason. Also, the mobile only plays for about three minutes, which is probably about average but definitely shorter than I would like."
4,Good film,"The cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a good ancient silent film in black and white. Let's imagine what the horror films were at that time.The first time I watched on TV this movie was two years ago since that time, I see this production as a work of art and maybe as the ""father"" of so many works made later in recent years.The second film (Dr Blood's coffin) is also good but it was produced in color."
4,Unboxing Hoya 77mm UV filter | Good filter for a cheap price!,Length:: 4:13 MinsHoya 77mm HMC UV Digital Multi-Coated Slim Frame Glass FilterThis slim frame Hoya 77mm HMC filter is well worth the money. I mean can you imagine buying another LENSE instead of buying another $20 FILTER! Doing the math we can all see that this is the best thing to protect your investment! Watch my video of the unboxing (un-boxing) of my Hoya multicoated (multi-coasted) 77mm UV filter and then get yours! Protect your lens and give sharp contrast to your color and black and white photos.
5,Excellent filter at a reasonable price,"I bought this filter due to it's many high ratings from reviewers. I was not disappointed. It's solidly built, fits well, and works great. I have two of them; one for my EF 70-200mm f/2.8 MkII and one for my EF 400mm f/5.6, and I put the filter on anytime there might be a chance that the lens gets wet (rain, surf splash, etc.). I've never noticed any negative effects on picture quality, but I also take the filter off if the sun or another bright light source will be in/near the frame."
2,Spyros bad,"I dont recommend this game at all, the graphics are nice at first but get boring, the game flat out sucks, the only reason i even gave it two stars is because i know how long it takes to make a game, and i of 14 couldnt even figure the damnb this out, its confusing as hell, and i didnt even want to play it because nothing drew me to it."
3,Starts out with a bang,"If you're a fan of Spyro on the PS1, you may be disappointed with this one. Overall the game is good and represents the series, but the controls stink. Gliding is a pain in the neck and maneuvering during the races is frustrating to say the least. (Why in the world can't GBA put a control stick on their game?) The levels are too hard for the payoff. It'll last you a few days, and then you'll be wishing you'd plopped down your money on Mario or Golden Sun."
2,Spyro,"I hated this game because it was the same thing each level, find the fairies and get the jewels. The levels got very boring after a while, and I was glad when I beat the game. I don't recommend this game to anyone. I hated it."
2,Not a good game for a Gameboy,"This is just not the type that makes a good Gameboy game. I found myself getting very frustrated because Spyro was hard to control. He moves in a diagonal path which makes him hard to maneuver. Many times I ended up falling off a cliff just because of his strange movements. I think the makers should have made his path straight so that you can actually see where he's going. Also, I didn't think the graphics were all that great."
2,It's a shame,I am one of the biggest Spyro fans on the planet but this game was really a disappointment!!The graphics were outstanding and the adventure was typical Spyro pleasing bliss. Unfortunately I don't think they ever should have put this game on GBA. The control is out of control and frustrating to say the least. The lack of visibility is a discrace when the scenery is such a huge part of all Spyro games. This should have been made into a Playstation 2 hit and become another all time Spyro great. I hope to never see another Spyro game on a miniature system again. I can't wait until the new Spyro game comes out in November for PS2. As I said it was a pitiful shame they didn't put this game on the PS2. GameBoys will never do justice to great games like these.
5,excellent game,"this is a must buy!! It has full 360 degree, 3-D, exploration (movement). You ve seen the playstation version, well here it is again, better than ever, becuase its the same graphics, possibly even better, but on a handhled, amazing!!! if this doesnt keep you occupied for hours even days, possibly months... THen nothin else will, guaranteed. Overall, fantastic graphics, unbeliveable gameplay, and good value."
1,WHAT?,"This is without a doubt the WORST Mega Man X Game in HISTORY!!! The levels are too hard, the story line is terrible, and everything else.... TERRIBLE!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! Waste Of Money!!!!"
2,Cheesy...bought two and they crapped out.,"My previous review said, ""If you can find it buy it"".. Sorry, I bought three of these and two crapped out already. Bummer."
5,Hallucinatory horror,"See Edwige Fenech, one of the most beautiful women in the world, terrorized and terrified. If you like this movie you're probably going to hell. But it's SO stylish and fun! Great contribution to the ""Satanist cult"" genre."
2,"Zila Prodentec Rotadent Classic, White","I've used this product twice and find that the motor in the product is not strong enough. Also, the product's is 12 months so this will always be a repeat purchase. Recommend that the product be improved to provide a longer life."
2,Not great item,This item is not what I expected it really runs slow the speed even when charged is not fast. I don't know if I have a bad one or if this is really just the way it is. The base is really cheaply made I had to put double side tape on it to keep it down on the counter. I would not buy this again. If fact I should of just returned it.
2,corroded by sixx months,i got this for my kids by they refuse to use it so i ended up using it. i guess my teeth got very clean but when i wake up there is a horrible slimy feeling on my teeth. never had that with sonic care or even manual brushing. called for replacement today and it will cost me $30 for them to ship me a replacement handle and charger
4,D. Johnson,"This is the second Rotadent I have bought. The first was through my dentist, four years ago, which we still use. This second one is just for me. My new dentist is always amazed how clean my teethare, and my healthy gums. I'm very happy with the product."
3,Zila Prodentec Rotadent Electric Toothe Bruch,"This electric toothe brush purchased from Amazon seems to work ok, except for the fact that there's a small crack in the upper middle portion of it. It will probably be a matter of time before the crack gets bigger, spread and the toothe bruch inventually becomes unusable. In case you ask, no it wasn't dropped, unless it was drop before or on arrival, but not since its been in my possession."
4,"Excellent Product, But Lifetime Warranty Does Not Apply","Very happy with the Rotadent. Unfortunately, according to the paperwork that accompanies the Rotadent, the lifetime warranty only applies if the product has been directly purchased through a dentist. This fact is not clearly stated in the Amazon site product description."
3,Interesting,"Interesting book, but very specific. This book is more adequate for economic's people than the others. Lack of images. Text very crowded."
1,Not received,"Dear all,Up till now I did not receive this book, can you trace it somewhere?kind regards,Erik Post"
4,Ximo Tebar,This is the one of the best Modern Guitar albums on the scene. You hear echoes of Wes and the group functions so well together. Buy it. Now.
4,Informative!,"The information in the documentaries is very interesting. However, Mr. Burns adds someof his own oppinions to each documentary that are not relevant to the history of thesubject. An example is The Statue of Liberty documentary has comments aboutslavery in it."
1,Boring,It has very descriptive language and has a few good thing going for it but the bottom line is it is boring so the rest doesn't matter.
3,"Poetic writing, weak plot","I really wanted to like this book, it has excellent style and beautiful writing. However, I hardly knew what was going on most of the time. This is partially due to the protagonist being confused, but more so by the writing itself.However, that being said, the writing style is excellent, well formed poetic sentences drip off the page, and there is a consistent tone of wonder. The universe is well formed, if incomprehensible.I read a ton of books, and have read a lot that are poetic yet understandable (such as Ursula K LeGuin) so was saddened by my lack of interest in the story itself. For the right reader, this is undoubtably a gem."
3,Slow reading,"I am sure this was a factual account of the tragedy, however not much detail was provided in many areas about the spread of the fire but more of an over view of all things that were occurring during the panic. This book was more of a tragedy that occured and some detail of the background of the politics involved that prevented the theatre from being fully fire safe."
1,Worst game I have ever played.,"I almost bought this game during two separate shopping trips, but decided to rent it first. Boy, was I glad I did. THIS GAME [ is bad] I can't believe it's a PS2, it seems more like a Game Boy Color, it's that bad. The voices are bad, the characters lips don't move and that really throws me off and the controls are horrible. The best thing about this game is the graphics on the box. When I returned this to the video store I rented Devil May Cry. Whoa, what a difference. DMC is caviar to this hunk of junk. Definitely rent it first, it is not worth [the money]"
1,Metal Gear Mummy?,"I was looking forward to this game lots. Sadly it is really poor. The graphics are very weak, they look like PS-One graphics. The character's are very wooden as they move along. The landscapes are dull & not intresting at all. The gameplay was weak too. Maybe they should have told the development team to wait for the next film instead. Avoid this game, wait for Metal Gear Solid 2. I feel that this is a very poor standard for PS 2."
1,Real Estate Section missing?,"An attempt at a comprehensive guide book of Greenwich, Connecticut compiled by a Greenwich Real Estate firm. The only entry in the Real Estate Category for a real estate firm is the publisher's own Real Estate Company. I don't think I would buy another edition of this book since most of the information is readily found either at the Public Library, on the internet or in other places in Greenwich for free. Why pay $12.95 (price on the book's back cover) for incorrect and outdated information? The cutesy illustrations and commentaries are not worth the price, in my opinion. For restaurant reviews I would stick with the Zagat Survey. The other sections of the book can be found entirely online."
2,I was rooting for the bad guy,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't finish this book. Got all the way through cd 7 and partly into 8 and was so pissed at the main character I had to quit listening. Through the entire book he proves to be a weak willed, lump of a person, making poor decisions. Here he is, supposed to be one of the top salesmen for a large company and he doesn't act anything like top salesmen I've known: Letting everyone run rough shod over him, insulting him and otherwise pushing him around, no stones and not even close to being the ""meat eater"" his bully-boy boss wanted."
1,finder is not a keeper,"What dreck--the ""hero"" Jason Steadman is the quintessential weenie. I finally had my fill of him about 85% of the way through and threw the book in the trash. I can not imagine anyone identifying with any of the weasel-like characters. I could be wrong though--maybe this is the new standard for the 21st century--people who know what the right thing to do is, but who can always find a reason not to do it."
2,A little silly,"You can see the plot and moves coming and they are very predictable...the main character is a little childish and his wife is a little dull...but a good quick read...comic book prose and entertainment without the pictures, but stiil better than TV."
5,Very Fine,"It took me awhile to get into Wilson's music, but it proved to be worth it. I can't believe how musicians can play such difficult music, but this group seems to do it l very easily. I'm glad I took the time"
5,A Treasure for Fans of Silent Shorts and Animation.,I highly recommend this DVD set to all fans of the Fleischer studios and to fans of silent cinema. This DVD set contains Ko-Ko the Clowns earliest cartoons from a time before he was just a costar in Betty Boop's shorts. These shorts are also interesting because they are a mixture of live action and animation. The shorts have an excellent background score done by animation legend Winston Sharples. This DVD set also contains lots of info on the Fleischer Brothers and on the actual shorts themselves. The picture quality is also very good.
4,Worth it for one song alone,"If you get this CD for ""Big Black Lady"" alone, it is worth it. That is one of the perkiest, foot-stomping, laugh out loud songs ever.The rest of it is okay to good, if a touch of crass (now there's a name for an album) doesn't bother you. I've liked him since SNL days and he's one of those stars that I'll go out of my way to watch if he appears on a talk show because he's quite off-the-cuff funny.He's got a great voice and is a funny songwriter who doesn't mind poking fun at himself.Monstrous: 20 Tales of Giant Creature Terror"
2,"""Mini"" is the word to pay attention to","I am returning my Bialetti Mini Express 2-Cup Stovetop Percolator. Although it looks really cute, and more or less works (my cups were roughly equally full), it has three major drawbacks. (1) it is ""mini."" Each cup is half full when it's done pumping. It doesn't even produce one whole expresso cup of coffee. (2) it splatters all over the stove top. (3) For the gravity-impaired (which includes most of us at 5:30 in the morning), if you make the coffee and then pick up only one of the two cups, the thing tips over and dumps the other cup all over your stove top, cat, floor. All in all, this thing is cute but pretty worthless. I say DO NOT PURCHASE. To quote Mr. Horse: ""Um.......... No Sir, I don't like it."""
4,Perfect for making my 2 cups in the morning,"For a 2 cup espresso maker, this is perfect. I use it on the simmer burner on my stove and get two cups in less than 5 minutes. Early on I did notice that the cups did not have the same amount of coffee in them, but somehow that has evened out over the last 2 years of use.Two issues:1) The cups tend to get very hot on the maker, even on a smaller burner. I typically need to let them sit for a minute or two, although the coffee is still hot when I can finally hold them and drink.2) When most of the coffee has been made, the two spouts sputter and spray coffee drops onto to the stove top. - This is the only reason I would consider a traditional Bialetti over this espresso maker."
5,LOVE IT,"We purchased this mini express 3 years ago and use it almost daily, great espresso and great for making a quick Americano. This second one is for one of the kids that had to have her own after using ours when she visits.The product is quick easy to clean and just works over and over again. Just buy it and enjoy."
3,It's Alright if your hardcore into it,"I bought this game because it was amazing for what the GBA can do.The dealer snuck me a brand new import version...same deal. five stars to the game play,five stars for the FX. and TWO stars for the replay value. Thats right TWO...This game features survival mode 5,10,30,50 and 100 battles. Time attack against 8 fighters (like a straight game no breaks),Vs bosses (play 4 bosses nonstop),beat up car and box bonus round,Vs Akuma,Vs Akuma/Ryu/Ken and Vs against Shin Akuma. And 3 stars on control.Its really hard to do a fireball,nevermind that,try Zangief's moves. To me....its ok.Get it if your hard core,but if your looking for a beat'em up to pass the time...pass on this game and go back to you SNES."
5,children love it!,My kids love this game it teaches them how to take care of stuff i also bought them catz 5 and they love both. My kids are 11 and 14 p.s 14 a boy so he wont try it but whenever my daughter plays it he says can i try something huh huh can i try? So i like this game even if he dosent say he does.
3,Decent workout. Now what I expected.,"When I bought this video, I was looking for something that would really push me to my limits. I wanted something that I probably would never have finished and walked away from.C.J. Caracci spends way too much time talking and stretching. Although stretching is very important, it's kind of dumb when you do it after every exercise. How are you supposed to get tired? Anybody can do a lot of pushups for a very long time as long as they're allowed to stretch for about three minutes after about every 15 pushups.Nevertheless, this video IS harder than any other fitness video I have ever seen. This video makes Tae-Bo looks like child's play.Just don't expect a true ""Navy SEAL"" workout. This is not even close to a real Navy SEAL workout."
4,Very good,"Les Luthiers es un grupo musical muy interesante, divertido , crítico y cuestionador. Exige mucho conocimiento cultural para entender a cabalidad sus letras y eso limita su público a personas que lo tengan o que se interesen en obtenerlo. Si quierenpensar y divertirse, lo recomiendo."
2,"AVP, really?","There are only two good movies in this pack, and AVP is not one of them. Why they chose to include this in this box-set is beyond me.Just grab Predator & Commando separately, save yourself the money."
5,Awesome CD,I was at that show at the ballroom it was a great show.I am so happy to say the cd is as awesome as the show was.They were hot that night and it truely shows on this cd.you will ba amassed to hear God bless the Conspiracy and Down by the river Live.A must have for all fans of the band.
2,Poor Organization. Explained Nothing.,"If you know your stuff, then you might be able to follow this book. Of course, you wouldn't need it either. If you actually want to learn the topics he discusses -- not discusses, but writes words about -- get another book."
2,Needs another round of editing before publishing,"Why don't authors test their code before they print it? All throughout the book author does this. For example, client side cursors can only be static type and in chap 3 the author codes .CusorLocation=adUseClient, .CusorType=adOpenKeyset (p.143). Geez. Other samples have adOpenDynamic. You can set the cursor type property to these enums but if you check the property via debug.print or in the locals window you will see the property = static. Something that simple makes me a bit unsure what is wrong with the more complex material in the latter part of the book. Other things that bothered me were the code on CD needed to be hacked to run. They should run right out of the box. Too much emphasis on the data controls. And what was all that about VCR drivers and video picons? what a waste of time and space. If I was married to this book I'd get a divorce!"
1,Haven't received it yet! :-(,In sure it'll be great once I've received it! It's been 3 weeks! I'm sure the delay has been caused by Christmas shutdowns! I hope!
1,these guys suck,"more like hello rip off, these guys are a water downed reggie and the full effect to the extreme. just drive-thrus way of capitalizing on the ""synth"" fase thats going on. and these guys cant say reggie influenced them, because it's like a blantant rip-off. even the song that sounds like theyre germans, CAN YOU SAY COMMON DENOMINATOR? and it's not like this is a good rip-off either, these guys suck. i cant think of one good thing about them. well, maybe that as soon as i start listening to this craptastic cd, i remember how bad it sucks and put on good synth pop, i.e., reggie and the full effect."
1,[Throws Up],"...aaaaaahhhh, awww man, awwww, I feel sick...That's how bad this band is, if I stay here any longer I might throw up again...oh no, AAAAHHH..."
1,hellogoodbye?,"more like hello rip off, these guys are a water downed reggie and the full effect to the extreme. just drive-thrus way of capitalizing on the ""synth"" fase thats going on. and these guys cant say reggie influenced them, because it's like a blantant rip-off. even the song that sounds like theyre germans, CAN YOU SAY COMMON DENOMINATOR? and it's not like this is a good rip-off either, these guys suck. i cant think of one good thing about them. well, maybe that as soon as i start listening to this craptastic cd, i remember how bad it sucks and put on good synth pop, i.e., reggie and the full effect."
5,Hellogoodbye with Jessie-classic!!!,"classic hellogoodbye. if you are a fan you must have this album. MUST. go. go on, get it. you know you want to."
2,buyer beware: probably not what you think it is,"Summary: Buyer beware, this is not a stereo-output mixerPros: Nice, compact design; well manufactured; simple circuitry likely to be very reliable.Major Con (pun intended): Device combines one unbalanced mono input and one stereo input into a SINGLE, MONO output that is, rather bizarrely, fed to TWO sets of stereo output jacks. THIS IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR IN THE ONLINE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION --- I thought I was buying a stereo-out device. When I received the package, the mono circuitry was clearly diagrammed on the back, along with text that was relatively unambiguous if not explicit. I confirmed all of this by cracking open the case and looking inside (while mumbling several explatives). SO THIS IS NOT A STEREO-OUT mixer. AGAIN: it takes one mono in, one stereo in, and outputs one MONO signal to four (what look like two stereo) outputs."
4,worth the buy?,"world wide edition is a great game. the promos are harpies feather duster sinister serpent and valkyrion the magna warrior. Over all the game play is pretty good and it is fun and challenging to unlock new packs and characters. The game is revolved around battle city and the rare hunters. The strategy and story to the game is great but there are some bad thingsPros- helps you master the game, current sets, and fun to playCons- there are some glitches throughout the game (ex. the game freezing when certain dice cards are used) and the graphics are not the best up to date, also after a while the music gets a bit annoyingBut overall this is a good game that most kids will enjoy. :)"
3,Wow... whats the big deal?,"This game i might say is Unbelievably unaventful. The gameplay is very nice, and it includes alot of new cards and strategies. but i found that the story itself is very as ive said before, uneventful. the story lines in all previous games have been a progressing five person enimy level, but this one really does not even have that. I would avoid getting this game if possible, and look more toward dungeon dice monsters if at all possible"
5,Yugioh World Wide Edition,"Konami does it again!being so far the 6th Yugioh video game,and 3rd gameboy yugioh game, its nearly perfect!There are only 2 things I don't like about it and they are:1.Its easy as a beginner to accdently run in to powerful duelist like Y.yugi or Seto Kabia on the world map.2.You don't really walk around in it.But even though you can't walk around in it it is still a great game!You baiscly find each availible duelist on each day.You talk to passengers to make the day go by or you can duel.Every monday you even get a magezine with five cards!Because it takes place in battle city,there is always somethig fun to do.But watch out for rare hunters!Any die-hard yugioh fan should buy this game..."
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING THIS GAME!!!,I am an 11 year old boy who is a huge Yu-Gi-Oh fan!! When I got this game I was soo disappointed.I'd save your money and buy one of the older Yu-Gi-Oh games. Now remember you can be the biggest Yu-Gi-Oh fan and be as disappointed as I was. So what I'm trying to say is DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Make that a promis!
3,Great chips but.....,"These are wonderful chips- thick, crisp, well-seasoned. The problem is that I was sent stale chips in a greasy, damaged box and they had expiration dates that were a month past. Freshness aside, I was also sent the wrong size bags. I got 12 large rather than 28 small. I usually have good luck grocery shopping at Amazon. Hopefully this is an isolated incident, but buyer beware."
3,NOT VEGAN,These are good tasting but I sure wish they would stop using EGG WHITES IN THEM. Loma Linda has a limited number of people who are going to buy this product. Why would they choose to exclude all vegans.
3,Only historical interest and incorrect titles,"This disk is out of interest for its music qualities. Only for all Karajan disks collectors. There are two title errors made by publisher on disk - 1. is not Fledermaus ouverture but Valse, 4. is not 6 but 9 symphony."
3,An OK read about an interesting subject.,"This book details 20 assassinations that changed history. Actually a few more were covered in the book. There was the two assassinations of the Somaza dynasty, and Indira and Rajiv Gandhi's murders. All told 20 particular cases that changed history, including the 4 US presidents.This was a simple read, and at 6 pages apiece for each assassination, not a heavy load for reading. However, I would say they were interesting. This was a very quick read for a history buff like myself. An OK read."
1,awful book,This is one of the worst technical books I have ever read. It seems like something cobbled together. It teaches very little vector calculus or mathematica.
5,This is a great beginner's book.,"This book has many colorful pictures, a nice layout and is well organized. Therefore, absorbing its contents is relatively easy. There are occaisional mismatches between the pictures and text but this can be easily overcome by focusing on the text while trying the applicable step on the PC."
3,The cover was offending,I never gained enough nerve to read Shadow Of The Dragon because of the offensive cover. The portrayal of Nazi Skinheads on the cover scared me away. The book would probably do better with another cover.
2,An ok book,I just finished reading Shadow of the Dragon and it wasn't at all interesting. I kept reading it and reading it and never got to the point of the story till the very end. I have to admit that it was kinda boring and lame.
1,No better than a $10 dripping coffee machine,"I bought this machine after reading all the good reviews here. But it turned out to be a big disappointment. I have a stove-top espresso maker that gives me good flavor espresso all the time. And the so-called ""espresso"" coming out of this machine doesn't even come close to the stove-top one. It tastes no better than the stuff coming out of a cheap coffee machine. Tried a few times and couldn't get any better results. So I returned it and stick with my stove-top espresso maker."
3,Great but w/ some clogging issues,"This worked great for a month or so, then the espresso started coming out so slow I knew something was wrong... so I decided to try to figure it out...I took the espresso holder thing off and looked up where it attaches and there area bunch of little holes where the steam/water should come out... it looked kinda dirty so I cleaned it w/ a towel, still didn't work, so I used a knife to unscrew the big screw and got it off... oh...my... goodness. There were huge amounts of gunk in there, like a white colored gunk... so I cleaned it out and reassembled and it works fine. Not sure why this happens, but its really gross... and I don't htink the machine is meant for the consumer to take apart, I couldn't get a screwdriver in there, just a knife sideways... from now on I'll be using filtered water and hope it helps."
2,difficult,received this for a christmas gift had to watch video several times and it took 4 people to figure it out and to boot it wasn't worth the effort!!!!
2,Expected more,"Annoying that regular mug cups do not fit. My husband uses 2 espresso cups to fill up 1 mug, and complains often how the coffee is warm, not hot.The ""warmer"" on top of the machine warms nothing.Noisy machine. Our last model was quiet, which is what you want early in the morning.At times the coffee comes out watery.We mourn the demise of our old espresso machine."
2,Better off paying a little more money,"A few months after I bought this machine, my wife bought me a high end espresso maker for Christmas. The difference in quality between the two is quite large. If you want an espresso maker, spend a little more money. If you want to go cheap, check out the Aeropress instead."
1,The Diffuser Can't be Cleaned,"After approximately 3 months of use, the diffuser (or whatever it is called) above the pod holder became clogged with coffee grounds and other goo. There is no way to remove the diffuser and clean it. Running coffee cleaner, using a toothe brush did notHamilton Beach 40729 Espresso/Cappuccino Maker with Pod Holderclear the small holes. I'll call Hamilton Beach in the A.M. and discuss the possibility of a warranty replacement. BTW, the diffuser (it's a plate with a gazillion holes in it) is attached by a large machine screw. The screw will not budge. If it would come loose, all would be well."
1,Horrible,"Do not buy this machine. The coffee holder gets hopelessly stuck, and one cannot possibly open it without using hardware tools."
2,Lasted 1.5 years,"Overall this was a good machine, but the lifespan was way too short. We got it for Christmas in 2006, and it died May 2008. We had to keep cleaning it out with vinegar or it would get clogged and not produce steam. Finally it stopped being able to produce espresso as well and there was nothing we could do to clean it or get it working again. I recommend you keep shopping."
4,Git this for Christmas,"I recieved the HB Espresso Machine for Christmas this year. I have used it once so far and made 3 cups of cappucino, and it worked great. The only problem I had was that the espresso didn't come out very hot. However, the instructions did have tips on getting a hotter brew, I just haven't had time to try it out.The only other disapointment for me was the warming tray. I turned my cup upside down on it as per the directions however my cup never heated up.Neither of these minor problems are important things to me though so I am ok with the performance of the machine.Over all if you are looking for a cheaper pump driven machine this one is good. It made my cappucino better than a Black and Decker steam driven model which was my only prior experince at making homemade cappucino."
3,Great for a beginner,"I got this machine for $25 on clearance. I wouldn't pay any more than that for this machine. It works OK for a while, but eventually it will start to leak steam (around the port area). The steaming wand is awful; it's awkwardly located and the steam it produces it weak. It takes over 5 minutes for me to steam a cup of milk, since i constantly have to stop and wait for the machine to heat it up. ""priming"" usually helps (meaning run the machine to make espresso, i guess) but not by much.It's great for a beginner, to learn HOW to make espresso and how to use the steam wand... but i am really looking forward to getting rid of this damn thing."
5,Recent purchase,"Thank you Amazon for processing my order efficiently and, as always, customer conscious. The book arrived in perfectly new condition and quickly. My husband loved this book so much he ordered one for each of our children but not himself. Imagine his surprise when he opened the package and it was for him!!!!"
4,"Fun toy, excellent Value","Mickey Fire Engine is well worth the money. Kids will enjoy it, alot of sounds and the bubbles are a added plus."
2,This is NOT 'Face at his best,"I really didn't like this album. It sounded like Scarface was just rapping over these beats and didn't really bring it. And I know how Scarface is because I have all his albums. The only good songs were ""Smile"" with 2Pac and the one that follows it, ""Smartz"". Also, ""Mary Jane""."
4,diary or untouchable,"I have yet to be disapointed by this man .He is flat out the best Mc ,his storys make sense unlike most artist that you can only catch a few words in between ebonics and giberish This cd is definetly one of scarfaces best next in line to the Diary.Untouchable was undoubtly money well spent"
2,Hated it,"I didn't enjoy the format of constantly jumping back and forth from doctor to patient; but, I certainly glad the author found the courage to share her story. I have read numerous books on this topic and found this one to be one of the least helpful."
3,Mathematical details about genetics,"The book has an excellent coverage of the mathematical subtlities of genetics. Theories are illustrated through numerous examples and the exercises at the end of each chapter contain probing questions which would test the understanding of the topics covered in the respective chapters. However, there are no chapters devoted to quantitative traits and association analysis, which are currently active areas of research. The coverage of linkage is also not adequate."
2,they should release other world series first,"The Twins' two championships were a bit of a travesty, in that they could only win in that dome with the shallow roof and unnaturally loud noise. Would they have won either year if they had to play on the road? Probably not, right?I'd prefer seeing1971, Pirates-Reds, 7 games1972, Athletics-Reds, 7 games1973, Athletics-Mets, 7 games1978, Yanks-Dodgers w the Bucky Dent game in Boston1982, Cardinals-Brewers, 7 games1997, Marlins-Indians, 7 games"
4,Gets the job done. Good product.,"I have a pup who despises clipping the nails, even though I started at a very young age. She eventually began trying to bite the clippers out of my hand when I would try. The process of clipping the nails turned me angry at her and her afraid and angry with me. I bought this product and the process was instantly better. With a little pile of treats nearby I grind away. It doesn't seem too noisy (of course it makes some noise) and when she gets antsy I give her a treat. I can grind all her nails very short and smooth in about 5-7 minutes. The tool itself is a little awkward and takes some getting used to especially when switching from left to right paws and vice versa. Overall I have gotten very good results and me and my dog are much happier with each other."
3,Nail Grinder,"I'm a new dog owner and have a male and female Pomeranian going on 6 months old. At the time that I received the nail grinder my dogs weren't vaccinated completely, making it very inconvenient getting there nails clipped at the local pet stores...not having a car made things that much more inconvenient. The Ingenious Nail Grinder Kit helped make a big difference for both my convenience and for the safety of my dogs. The grinder is effective, however, my dogs (being pups) are slightly afraid of the sensation. For new dog owners, I would recommend extensive research on nail grooming prior to purchasing."
5,A Truly Insightful Book!,"Philosophy, religion, politics, poverty, gay marriage, and human rights are just a few of the topics that are thoughtfully discusses in this novel. Dan Spiro does an exceptional job of providing a well rounded perspective on each topic, which is spoken from the view points of his colorful and diverse characters. I thought the story was engaging and that the characters were easy to relate to. What I most liked about this book was that Mr. Spiro was able to present his arguments in an unbiased, insightful, and simple manner that anybody can use to contemplate important societal issues in their own life. This book opened my eyes to different perspectives on religion and philosophy that I had not been able to rationalize on my own. If you have any interest in philosophy or religion or would simply enjoy a light-hearted story centered in Washington DC, this is a must read."
5,A Great Read!,"Dan Spiro's Creed Room, through its characters, permits the reader to consider the fundamentals of modern thought in America without judgment. This novel is unique in that the exploration of beliefs is told in a story with fictional characters instead of a tome with static comparative analysis. It is thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. A truly great read."
1,Horrible,"I don't know where to start with this. First of the rubber bands themselves were defective, upon stretching they appear cracked and then tear. Also I feel as if I was overcharged for unnecessary shipping. The product came in a giant box that was definitely not needed for the tiny bag of defective rubber bands."
1,Broken Frets,"I was really quite happy with this guitar -- nice amp, beautiful design, good sound -- but within a day of playing it, the notes on the first fret stopped working, giving a ""twang"" sound instead of a note. I tried adjusting all the adjustable features, but it just got worse and worse. I can't tell if I just happened to get a lemon, or if they all break eventually.I ended up exchanging it for a ""Squier"" by FenderSquier by Fender Stop Dreaming-Start Playing Set: Affinity Special w/ Fender 15G Amplifier, Metallic Blue-- I recommend that one instead -- it's better built, more reputable brand, and a bit more fun to play (though a bit more expensive).The good news is that Amazon is GREAT with returns, they took it right back, and even paid for shipping."
5,Fine Repair Manual,I chose this manual because I neede to fix some problems on a VW Golf that I was given. It is easy to read and understand.
4,fistful of something,"Bruce Campbell is back as Ash...again. The graphics are much better then last evil dead game, and the controller are way easier to handle. There are however some minor issues. First is apparently Ash has lost weight. Somehow in his off season Ash lost about 15 pounds. Now I'm not saying Bruce is a fat guy, but certainly not thin, so the Ash models don't look exactly like him, more like his younger, thinner brother. Second the game engine had a a brain fart and I got stuck in the game for about an hour. You need dynomite to clear out the club and for some reason the engine forgot to drop dynomite. So I spent about an hour going through the entire map looking for some type of clue until I finally went online for a walkthrough. Lastly although the game is low priced, it's a rather short game. Apparently PS2 games have to be under 8 hours of game play. I beat this game in under a week. What happened to the FF7 days when you could never beat a game?"
5,Evil Dead fan's dream,This game has all fun campy horror of the movie and more. It plays like hunter the reckoning but with every ones favorite character Ash kicking the undead ... Great graphics and sound and Bruce Campbell does the voice of ASH!
4,Teddy Bear In Box,"A Great Choice with good value.We liked this one but also purchased and Loved the Pony In The Box.Either way, you cant' go wrong.Buy a few to have for quick gifts."
4,Cute as a button Teddy Bear Jack-in-the-box,"Cute, colorful and bright.Rotate handle to pop out the little bear.Sometimes pops up too fast, but works quite well.My niece and nephew love it!"
4,read it in two days!,I think this is a very exciting book. It has many names you have to remember but is is easy once you start and get the hang of it. It only took me two days to read it! very interesting book.
1,Terrible Customer Service! DO NOT BUY!!!,"Buyer beware! I purchased this and my computer kept giving me error messages from the install...well after numerous phone calls and chat sessions of false promises from their IT I had to give up. They would say Employee X will be reviewing your logs in one hour and will e-mail you by the end of the day.....only to follow with no contact. Or ""an engineer will be calling you, when is a good time?"" but never respond! Each time I contacted them I had to wait on hold for at least 30 minutes, and then twice they disconnected the call, and didn't call me back! Do NOT buy this software!"
3,Registry Mechanic 5.x PC system repair,Just did not fix my slow pc or internet lock up issue. All in all did not fix a real problem or issue with my system registry and was not worth buying for me and my issues.
2,REGISTRY MECHANIC 5.x PC,"The product was easy to install but there was a trick I noticed.A day after installing the software I ran full scan. To try the sincerity of the software, I downloaded same free trial. To my chagrin I was told my computer has about 420 problems and could only fix about 15.My question now is are all these gimmicks?"
3,Not As good as Registry First Aid or Norton System Doctor,"I regularly use Registry First Aid Platinum, Norton System Doctor and Registry Mechanic. I have tried all the combinations and by far, Registry First Aid (and Norton System Doctor) out performs Registry Mechanic.Registry First aid even detects the registry entry made when an ""unsaved"" e-mail attachment has been opened.As a matter of fact, I have learned a great deal about the Windows registry from running Registry First Aid. You would be surprised at the pervasiveness of the registry.I would rate Registry First Aid as the best, Norton System Doctor (actually it is quite good!) as second followed by Registry Mechanic."
5,addicted,"fired from my job, wife and kids left me--with the dog. my neighbors won't talk to me because the house and yard are in such a mess. but i can't seem to leave this warm spot in front of the stereo. ""Hello. My name is Shannon and I'm a Luke-aholic."""
4,Good overview for CRM customers,Its a good book and easy to read. The experiences of the writer flow out of the words and evry point made is common sense and easy to agree with. If your a CRM customer or about to become a CRM customer then this is a great book to read in preperation for your project/implementation.
2,Big Disappointment,"I have just read Carl Bernstein's book, Loyalties and found it fell far short of what I would have expected from a man of his high journalistic reputation. His father did not want personal vignettes put into the book and yet Mr. Bernstein had lots of private comments about his parents that I felt were an invasion of their privacy. He also spent a lot of time on his own life at that time which really was secondary to the tumultous events his parents had been involved in. There should have been more input into the causes and events during those McCarthy years and what he did put in was episodic and not put together clearly. I also did not quite understand his attitudes regarding his parents' activities and membership in the Communist party which he put them on the spot about. He doesn't make things too clear. I felt he was too aware of making an impression with his writing abilities."
3,See if your library has it before buying,"For the most part this book is fairly well written with the exception of a few chapters at the end. The first half of the book offered the majority of what I found to be useful information. The second half however, seemed to shift away from the book's focus and on to something else (mainly motivation). All in all not a bad book. See if your library has it before buying."
5,Excellent!...,"I'm so grateful that I read this book. I think it's way more professional than ""The fine art of small talk"". It has an inside-out analysis of conversational behaviors. Plus it not only teaches you what to do, but how to do it in such a clear and organized way. I will feel ashame if my communication skills don't get significantly improved after reading this book.Excellent book! Give it a try!"
5,Once you start you can't stop,"I read this book before and really liked it. Then, one day I was going to let my friend read it so I just wanted to read the character intros so I could remember what it was about. Do you know I had to read the whole book? This is the best Omar Tyree book I have read. You get sucked in from the first page and can't put it down until you are finished. I highly recommend this book."
4,Wow,"This book was VERY interesting. Once again, Tyree eloquently tells the story of issues that effect the African-American community. The book was a bit preachy, especially when told through the eyes of the character Wes, but the message was good anyway. I thought ""Butterman"" was very foolish to get caught up in the drug-dealing game, especially since he didn't have to. I was very pleased that things turned out so well for Shank, because he was the character one would think would be least likely to make it out of that lifestyle. I would love to see this book made into a movie. I think Mekhi Phifer would be the perfect guy to play Shank!"
1,0 Stars might be too low,Was sent with a cracked 5th coil. After installing it started arching. It took out my wires and plugs. Inferior product that you're stuck with after it's installed. I would not recommend it.
1,never got it,"HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT SO I CAN""T TELL YOU HOW IT ISHAVEN'T RECEIVED IT SO I CAN""T TELL YOU HOW IT IS"
5,Never let me down,"I've purchased these twice now. My husband and I were trying to have a baby, so I got the 5 pack. The first few were negetive, which was correct, and by the 4th it was positive, which was also right. And just to double check I used the 5th and it was also positive. The test line always scared me, so just know before you use them that a pink line will immediately appear if the test strip works.. Then if you're pregnant you'll see another one appear within 3 minutes I think. Mine appeared almost immediately though, both times. Recently I bought another pack to have on hand. I took one when I had a scare and it was negetive...so basically, 6 out of 6 have been accurate for me. I trust these strips, and love the price. It's nice not to have to spend $15 every time you think you're late! I like to know as soon as possible so I don't eat or drink anything I shouldn't if pregnant, and at this price I don't feel like it's wasting money."
3,Easy to read,I kept getting negative responses but the test is so easy to read that I am sure when I do concieve I will not have to second guess the accuracy.
1,Never received again,"I gave the benefit of the doubt and tried to order again. I received my ovulation tests, but nothing on the pregnancy test. The ovulation tests came from a different company that shipped quickly. This company took the money from my account quickly, but I never received any product both times."
1,I really am pregnant,"I guess you get what you pay for. They're cheap and for us, unreliable. I took a test when I was in fact about 4 weeks pregnant and it came up negative. It would have been nice if I'd known at that time that I was pregnant until I started to feel symptoms about 2 weeks later."
3,"Great Service, Not so accurate","I ordered these tests and received them a few days later. I was pleased with the time frame. I tried them for a couple days with BFNs and then decided to try a different brand of test strip. These showed a clear negative, but the other ones showed a faint positive. I decided to confirm with a drug store HPT (First Response Early) and it was also faintly positive. I have had 2 days of positive tests with the other 2 brands (6 tests were all BFPs so I know it's true), still no BFP with these. Price and service are great, lack of results are not so great. My guess is that you have to have already missed your period for these to work, even though they say early."
3,not crazy about these,These take the full 5 minutes to show a positive result and were not as sensitive as the other tests I've tried.
1,Atlas of Kentucky,"This is a geo-political publication, NOT an atlas in the normal sense of the word. In fact, calling it an atlas without further clarification of its true nature is extremely misleading."
2,A bad fighting game.,"Stake: Fortune Fighter is one of the worst fighting games to hit the market. It offers four player fighting, but it will be hard to convince your friends into playing this mess.Four players are on screen at once. Unfortanutely, this game is no where near Super Smash Brothers (Gamecube) or Power Stone(Dreamcast). It is not even as good as Microsoft's Kung Fu Chaos. The only other Xbox fighting game which is worse is Bruce Lee.The graphics have a long way to go before they reach Xbox standards. The characters are low-res, the environments lack detail, and the animation is bad and choppy.Controls are awful. You will try to perform certtain moves, but often, it just doesn't happen. Don't buy this mess."
3,marginal image quality though inexpensive,"Opteka lenses are a low cost alternative to the Canon brand conversion lenses.However, the image quality is not very good, and will only be acceptable on smaller size images. If you use a protective UV filter, the lens will vignette all 4 corners a little bit.The lens is a big chunk of glass and blocks nearly all of the view through the viewfinder, so you will need to use the LCD for framing purposes.You also need to set your zoom to the widest setting, so it becomes a fixed-focal length lens (no zooming).It comes with an aluminum adaptor, which normally costs about $15 on its own.It's probably worth $30 if you are not too particular about image quality and are not making fine art shots."
5,Have a Nice life....,"When Nin, Zola, Sally, and Olivia meet their fairygodmother. He (yes it's a he) shows them their futures, aLl which leave much to be desired. Each one of them is shocked to see what their life will be like in 10 years. So in an attempt to fix it all they make a pack to try to change it for the better. But as they start out they reallize that chageing their lives may be a little harder than they would expect.I found this book to be orginal and very funny. It was so adicting that I read it all in one night (didn't take to long though, it's kinda short). I would reccomend this to anyone who likes funny orginal books. This looks like a very interesting series!"
3,A bit acidic,"I have tried other silver needle white teas, and I found this to be very acidic. Not sure if this is the tea itself or due to the metallic container and its material.I will not order it again."
5,Have we evolved?,"Professor Larson writes a well-researched history of the anti-evolution movement in the US. If you believe Spencer Tracy told the story, then do yourself and favor and read this book."
3,LATCH Kits are NOT universal,"While this LATCH retrofit kit may work great with some vehicles, not all LATCH equipped vehicle, seat, and retrofit kit combinations will work.I recently took this kit, along with a seat it was approved for use with (an infant, rear facing seat) to a car seat installation inspection provided by the California Highway Patrol. It just plain old won't work. The belt of the kit is too long for the belt path in my vehicle (a 2002 Saturn Vue) and we wound up ditching it for the good old seatbelt.PLEASE, regardless of whether the kit is approved for use with your particular seat, go get the installlation checked out by a professional, to make sure it is safe in YOUR vehicle."
1,Chaplin deserves better,"I was thrilled when I bought this video because it contained 57 short films by one of the early masters. I couldn't have been more let down. It is obvious that the makers of this DVD had no interest in their subject other than to make money off of him. The most annoying and consistent element in this selection of videos is how they formatted the videos to fit the TV screen: In the same way that widescreen converted to full screen cuts off the sides of the film, these films were carelessly squeezed into a format that frequently cut off the top (People's HEADS) or bottom of the screen. Whole segments are run where you don't see above a person's mouth. It is infuriating."
5,Beautiful. A rare find.,"I would rather read than do anything. I spend my shopping time in bookstores. Why? Looking for a book just like this book: insights and truth, humor, pain. I finished this book at 4 a.m. wondering where on earth I'll ever find another such book. I am not the same person who began Mr. Morton's book and I want to thank him."
4,A lovely read.,I enjoyed this novel very much. I had seen the film and wanted to read the book. Frank Langella did a masterful job of capturing the hero.I recommend it for those of you who enjoy an old-fashioned read. My sister didn't want it to end. Neither did I!May D
3,One of two Damned radio sessions CDs,This CD is one of two CDs The Damned have that feature alternate studio recordings of their songs.The other CD is called Radio One Sessions. There is no overlap of material between the two.The song selection and recording quality on Radio One Sessions is superior.Radio One Sessions also includes an absolutely smokin' version of Wait For The Blackout.
3,"well made, but my child just did not take to it","Well made set, both cars with moving parts. However my child just did not take to it and has not noticed it missing. Mind you he got a lot of thomas stuff at christmas.I only gave it 3 stars cause out of all the Thomas trains he got he seemed to like this the least so I sold it. Note there are no faces on the front of the cars."
5,"Perfect, Perfect, Perfect!","I've been a long-time fan of the ""Beatmania""/""Hip Hop Mania"" arcade series. I crave music games, and there have never been enough good ones. ""Parappa the Rapper"" more or less defined the genre, but I didn't find it terribly satisfying.Then Harmonix brought us ""Frequency"", and it was very interesting. Yet something intangible was missing from the gameplay.Then came Amplitude, a sequel to Frequency. Perfect execution. Smashing graphics. Great songs. Easy for new players. Unbelievably challenging for experienced players. Multiplayer modes (both online and offline) are fabulous. This game is serious, unique fun.Maybe you're holding out hope for a music-oriented game that doesn't leave you disappointed. Or maybe you've tried ""Guitar Hero"", developed by the same brilliant folks, and want more of the same sort of genius. Or maybe you're just looking for something different. If this describes you, look no further. Buy this game now!"
4,Mindhunter's Review,"This is the sequal to Frequency. More bands in Amplitude then there where Techno in FreQ.The only think that disapointed me about Amplitude is that there they dident mostly did place any great hit songs from the bands they had on there. Second problem is, is that It could use more songs and levels.Online feature is cool because you can play songs a remix song on line up to 4 players.You can get high rank if you score higher then other players to but there has been problems i heared about ranks droping when playing remixes. ""I don't know why"".I recommend this the music fans and DJ's"
2,"Good, not great. Not worth the price.","I bought this headset in hopes of finding a pair of moderately high-end phones with noise cancelling and a USB connection. Unfortunately, I misread the specs. Although titled ""Sennheiser PC155 Traditional Binaural PC Headset with USB and Noise canceling"" [sic], the microphone -- not the headphones -- is noise cancelling. Beyond that, the phones offer a weak (but very low noise) output. The headset is extremely comfortable, even on big ears like mine, and the microphone works great. Still, for the cost of this item, I'm better off with a good set of traditional 3.5mm headphones and a good mic."
5,Great buy,My grandson wanted a book on how to cook the right way. I predict he is going to be thrilled. I bought a used version and it arrived in good shape . The used price allowed me to also buy another used book.
4,must have,"Not as exhaustive as his ""Sauces"" book, but valuable for filling my knowledge gaps in techniques and preparation. Step by step photos are helpful. Great refresher course."
5,Chow time,These are great. Tastes like a bbq potato chip and not a bad price. I bring these to work to save some money and so far they have.Just the right size and flavor.
2,Movie,It was ok for the moment. After you watch it a couple of times - that's enough. Wouldn't buy it again.
1,unreliable,"Initially we were thrilled with this battery tester. However, after using it less than a dozen times it started not working intermittently. Very disappointing! The tester is powered by a AAA battery, which we replaced several times, but it still didn't work well."
2,Where is it?,"Where os it? O' my bad it was out of stock so didn't even get to play the game. Instead I just my money bad from bad service. I am never going to by from this seller again, and it even took forever to tell me it was out of stock."
4,hate,"I bought this game and couldnt wait to play it when I first got my GBA, but then I kept getting stuck in the same place and had no patience and then when I saved it didnt show and I had to keep starting over,uggh maybe that just my game but man im staying away from breath of fire and most roleplaying games (no patience). The only thing I liked was the graphics, but if you have great patience go ahead and buy, be my guest."
1,not happy,I didn't know it would take 3 weeks to get it took money right away though unhappy never ever again
3,Misleading photo/Wrong product sent,"I bought the Sega because I still have a ton of games for it and my original system had died years ago.Ideally, I would give 0 stars for the product I received but 5 for the system in general.I was very dissapointed to find upon arrival that the machine I received was absolutely filthy, like some slob had been eating over it and scratching it while playing it for quite some time. I understand it is used, but seriously, they couldn't even wipe it off?The second thing I noticed was that it did not come with 2 or even one controller, even though they are pictured for the item.Lastly, I purchased this because it said it had the composite (yellow, red & white) cables instead of a coaxial hookup, this was also false.I realize these problems are all the fault of the seller and not of the system, but make sure you look into the seller first, mine was 1UP Video Games."
4,system works great,system works great. product was packed and shipped asap. works just as well as a new one. having john madden wars like I cant believe I'm saying this ...20 years ago.
3,Well,The description of this item does say just the system but no one will believe that if the pictures have controllers in them. the system worked but was dusty
5,reminder when Sega mad there own system,"remember when Sega actually mad video game SYSTEM I DO BACK WHEN THE SYSTEM WAS ACTUALLY ON THE MARKET THE ONLY OTHER SYSTEM THAT WAS HURTING SEGA WAS NINTENDO The Sega Genesis is a fourth-generation video game console developed and produced by Sega. It was originally released in Japan in 1988 as Mega Drivethen in North America in 1989 as Sega Genesis, and in Europe, Australia and other PAL regions in 1990 as Mega Drive. NOW FOR A LIST OF MY FAVORITED GAMES AAAHH!!! Real Monsters. Addams Family Values. The Addams Family.Back To The Future Part III. Batman Forever. Batman: Revenge Of The Joker."
3,A Bit Bland,These would be better with a lot more seasoning. I can think of several other vegan breakfast sausages that taste better.
4,its tejano,"If you know tejano music then you know about Mazz and you would know their music is really good .You can't go wrong with a cd of their 20 hits .I was actually just looking for one song I couldn't buy as a single so I bought the cd ,I recommend buying it .Its good"
1,Turned me off zen completely!,"If I ever had any interest in Zen, this book would squash it! Anderson goes on about how wonderful it is to put the spoons a certain way in the gomasio bowl, and yet when talking about the problems with Richard Baker, comes across as never having the courage to confront him. Maybe he was too busy setting the spoons the right way in the gomasio bowl and holding arcane precepts ceremonies to actually consider how the precepts might work in actual life."
4,Great suppliment to any course,"I believe this is about as good as you can get, as far as books on chinese that is.It gives hints on things that after you read you realize is correct, but for some reason no one else has stated it.Since this book very quickly advances, I believe you need another course with lots of repetition. As others have stated Fluenz course is a good way to go, lots of repetition that will enable the material to stay in your head.But since Fluenz does not have any good reading material to compliment the course at this time, do yourself a favor and get this book!"
2,"Warning, CD and Text not clearly related","Teach Yourself Chinese contains a major instructional flaw in that there is no correlation between the PRONUNCIATION GUIDES in the BOOK and the PRONUNCIATION EXAMPLES AND PRACTICE on the CD. Though the manual seems to do a good job of explaining the sounds and tones associated with spoken Chinese, the CD is not correlated with any written form. Therefore, when listening, one cannot determine whether a sound is a slight variation of the previous sound or a new sound that is much like the previous sound. Not providing associated pinyin text of at least the first part of the CD is pedagogically irresponsible. Be warned, you will be frustrated with this program if you think it will provide you a clear association between the written form and the spoken form of the examples provided."
2,What I should have known...,"Is that though this book is good... it has some major flaws, which make it close to useless when working on pronunciation. As stated in a previous review there is no direct correlation between the pronunciations on the CD and the guide in the text. Also it has no Chinese reference of sound, which I had to learn from my tutor and is much easier and more logical when starting to speak, read and write. With that Chinese reference you can sound out a word, write the sounds out and be able to communicate even if you do not know the Chinese character. That would be incredibly useful for a beginner who may know the word but not yet the character. I hope the revision is written with the absolute beginner in mind."
1,how to draw manga,"I ordered this book in nov. for a christmas present, is now feb.still have not recived the book. now they say I never ordered itbut paid for the book and the shipping.. Only in america people......"
1,Worst cycle computer I have ever had.,"This is the worst cycle computer I have ever had. It shows you what gear you are in which is great and the reason I bought it, everything else about it is a fail.* Speed sensor is huge, ugly and does not fit an aero fork well.* Very difficult set up.* To many functions to scroll through to get to the ones you need, the two I use most often (distance and average speed) are on two different sets of functions you cycle through.* Way to easy to accidentally press a button, an accidental press of the left button stops your trip distance. Good luck following directions or getting useful ride data after that.* You have to press a tiny button on the back to wake it up.* Slow refresh time for speed and cadence.And after just over a year it stopped registering what chainring he chain was on making the cadence function completely useless."
2,Another blabbermouth wastes time and print,"He talks way too much; he could have covered many of the things he only ""touched on"" with less gift of gab and more hands-on procedures. Too much talk is boring; had to drink extra coffee to get through some of the verbal marathons, as with other Sam's books, just too much flapping of the mouth. I actually prefer Microsoft online tutorials, neat and concise."
4,Good way to build your VB Foundation.,This is a good book for beginners but don't expect to get through it in 24 hours. You need about 1-3 hours per chapter to get through questions and exercises. Definitely a lot of bang for your buck!
4,Good Inexpensive Introduction,"This book is a good introduction to VB5 and the price is right, but like all things, you get what you pay for. I thought the information was presented in a logical and easy to follow manner, although note that some of the programs/examples referenced in the text were either not present on the CD-ROM, or did not work as described. I don't consider this a show-stopper, as I have always considered the CD-ROMs that come with books to be less than satisfying. This one was no exception. For a beginner programmer with little or no prior progamming experience, this book will suffice to get you started. On those terms I would recommend it. The best choice (if you have the extra $$) is Mike Halvorson's VB5 Step by Step published by Microsoft Press. It's top notch."
1,Good luck using this thing,"I bought this kit to install some door locks and they're so cheap that they only give you ONE mandrel for two saw bits. The manual tells you to drill the 2 1/8"" hole, then ""disassemble 2 1/8"" hole saw and assemble 1"" hole saw"". Yeah, good luck... once you drill with one of the saws, that mandrel stays in that saw bit and you won't be able to get it out even with your best wrenches. I'm stalled halfway into my door drilling and am returning this piece of Chinese made junk."
5,A must for any teenager,This book was fun to read and had lots of great tips and tricks for the modern teenage girl. I'd highly recommend it!
2,"BEWARE, IT'S MONO!","I tend to agree with the reviewer who says poor remastering. This has to be the quintessential combination of great artistry and poor sound quality. I am always thrilled by Callas' and Gobbi's voices, regardless of how poor the sound quality, and this one is no exception. But to add to what others have said about the sound quality, I found a lot of transient distortion, and ragged scratchy spots where a singer or the orchestra would come in strong after a quiet passage. Furthermore, unrevealed by the website description, is that it's not in stereo, quite remarkable for this day and age.I guess if there's a better remastering of the same LP, I'd go for it, but I haven't heard the others. Perhaps the master tape was mono and so are they."
2,Non-horrifying horror,"This novel, by one of the great modern science fiction authors, was not what I was expecting. Homebody isn't science fiction, it's more of a light horror/romance. I almost stopped reading during the first half, because the story seemed like a misplaced romance novel, a genre I have absolutely no interest in. The second half was definitely an improvement over the earlier chapters, but the overall book was a disappointment. The plot and its twists were extremely predictable, and it never really reached what I would consider horror. I was annoyed by the disappearance of the first female lead--she was written as if she would be a main character, then she diappeared halfway through and was never heard from again. Very sloppy.I think I'll stick to Card's sci-fi, if this is what happens when he switches genres..."
2,A second rate story from a first rate author,"I have loved almost everything that OS Card has written. His combining of sympathetic characters with solid speculative fiction sets him apart from the rest of the genre. I don't know what happened with ""Homebody"". It is a pedestrian ghost story that could have been penned by any number of grocery store authors. Read ""Ender's Game"" again rather than waste your time with this novel."
1,Total Misconception,"The toy in this picture is not what I received. It is just a clear shell. Not a truck. As a matter of fact, it is still in the shipping box, not even touched. Have had no luck contacting the seller to return."
3,Cool and sexy,"I was expecting something different. I felt wanting for a little more ""meat""--it was just too cool for my blood. Ribot seemed better suited to contemporary jazz guitar fans looking for something different, as opposed to salsa lovers looking for something more contemporary. ""Lomos de New Jersey,"" with spoken English translation over the music and lyrics bugged the hell out of me.But I kept listening. And the hell started haunting me! Something about Ribot's raw guitar contrasted with the smooth Spanish crooning got under my skin. This isn't salsa. It's jagged punky NY meeting a sensuous Latin rhythm, a cool hipster groove to make you dance and laugh and sometimes inspire air-guitar windmills for serious traditionalists to joust. Enjoy."
3,It entertains and enlightens,"The main character Jay, a young man coming from a home sorely lacking in love and support, takes a trip to Winnipeg in order to search for his father. Coming from a small place, Jay is rather nave and carries with him some objectionable prejudices such as homophobia. In his travels he meets a variety of characters, including a gay man who gives him a lot of support, a vegetarian who lost his nephew to AIDS, and a native who is a practising Shaman. Through his interaction with these people, Jay grows as an individual and learns a lot about life.Spirits of a Feather is not your typical novel. It combines a variety of narrative techniques which places it in a category all its own. The book is a combination of fiction and non-fiction. It is designed to educate as well as entertain, and as such, would make a great high school reader.Reviewed by: Laura Davis (professional writer)"
3,"Mongolian fieldwork, but concentrate, here comes the science","A joint US-Mongolian team has been pulling wonders out of the Gobi desert since the early 1990s. Bizarre flightless birds, nestfuls of mammals where before there had been only skulls, and of course dinosaurs. Novacek's account brings this to life, but the alternation of episodes of fieldwork with globs of science was jarring for me. I wanted to read more of a continuous narrative about the effort and logistics of mounting an expedition in a remote part of the world, and what life is like working in an inhospitable desert, day in, day out."
5,Fantastic! It works surprisingly well!,"We used to use wet-wipes/baby wipes to clean off our greyhounds muddy feet; we used to go through 3 packs a week! Now we keep a rag by the door (which we have to change every two to three days) and we fill up the paw plunger before going out. It does a great job of getting off caked on mud. It also works wonders on our Afghan hounds feet (bigger feet, lots more hair).It is very easy and takes what used to be a terrible five minutes with the greyhound and made it a quick one-minute breeze. (afghan takes longer, but thats due to all the hair!)If your dog's paws are too big to go through the top, what you can do is unscrew the top, places your dogs paw in the water, the put your dogs paw through the BOTTOM of the scrubbing part, while still holding over the water. This should clean the paws and get rid of any tough dirt."
4,Wonderful,"Works just like it says. My only problem is that the lid is hard to thread onto the cup, it does take some patience. Otherwise it works wonderfully. My problem before getting the pawplunger was that the dogs would come in with mud stuck in their nails and no matter how hard you try, there is no getting it all out until they take off running through the house leaving streaks of dirt in the carpet. Now with a few plunges of the feet and drying the paws.. all is clean and ready to go."
2,Not all I had hoped for,"I bought this product looking for a floor mirror for my 3 mo. old daughter to play tummy time. Unfortunately the mirror is a little high off the floor so she can't actually see herself in it when she's on her tummy holding her head up. Also there is no volume control and the voices are a little loud and startling for her. I gave this 2 stars because it's colorful, and at least my 2 1/2 yr. old son likes to play with it. I think I will just go get a floor length mirror and prop it up horizontally against my entertainment unit like I did when my son was a baby. He loved that and it worked way better than this toy!"
4,good baby mirror option,"We only used this as a floor mirror, but our daughter loved the ""tails"" and animal heads. They're great for grabbing! We had a problem with several of the tails not working after a while, but Sassy provided a replacement at no cost. The only thing that might have improved this is for grabbing the animal heads to make sounds too. I guess that might be asking a bit much and this is a good product even without that...."
5,Great!,Great product. Used to send textbooks into the trade in program. Did what they needed to do. Can't comment on how they arrived but Amazon accepted them so obviously it was intact! Cheap and great product.
2,good but not good enough,"it doesn't hold down enough tension to be a good capo.I do understand that this is how they keep the guitar from being 'sharp' when you put the capo on, but it's a design that I feel has not been perfected yet. so I am returning my G7 capo and I'm gonna start using my trusty ol' dunlop again. once you start bending strings and riffing when the capo is on, things start getting weird quick, the strings move around, meaning they're not being held down hard enough... and trust me, I squeezed the living HELL out of this thing and it didn't get any tighter.even if other capos are making the guitar go sharp, they hold the strings down better. so as much as I wanted to like this capo...my advice is, save yourself some money and get a regular capo. (I've been playing since 1989, and I've been using capos since around 1992). Cheers."
1,HE is not a nutritionist and not a Doctor - See a Doctor,The book is a poor written copy of other books that cover diet and nutrition in a much more thorough manner. If you want a good diet see the American Heart Association diet for free or the American Diabetes Association.The so much of his products that he sells on TV hasbeen returned that his company had declared bankruptcy.
2,Did not work for mom,I bought this for my mom but she was so disappointed. it was so hard to manage sound level and it did not work at all. she tried it for few hours then for few days but nothing. i tried to find a phone # or an e-mail so I can talk to someone.. I want to return it.
2,not so great,"I've known and liked Sara Katz from her columns on Slate. Well, this book just didn't seem realistic, and sort of fizzled at the end. Not so great is all I can say."
5,Sturdy!,"This is a very sturdy and well-made extension pole. I will have this forever. Any attachable roller, edger, etc. will fit on this. I have finally finished my 2 story stairwell! Definitely recommend."
4,Pretty Good,"These worked pretty well for what I needed them for (drawing on fondant). I did find that I had to press very lightly, and keep the fondant very cold, or the markers would punch holes in it. But overall I am pleased with the product."
2,It's not that great.,This book wasn't that great. There were VERY few ideas that I would use. I wouldn't recommend buying this book.
5,Good Cable,"I purchased this cable to use with the DigiTech RP500 and it worked out great. The cable is strong and attractive. Once plugged in it's hard to pull out - it has a tight fit which is good. The color coding is not that big of a deal, because it's only a few feet long but came in handy when work out of the back of a rack. Good product."
1,Junk,"I bought this train case based on all the positive reviews. They must have changed the design recently because the quality of the one I received is horrendous. One of the rivets that holds the folding trays inside the case was broken when I received it. Opening and closing the folding trays is extremely frustrating. One corner always folds in while the other stays out which bends the metal arms. You really have to use two hands to fold the trays and even then it is difficult. The outside of the case is better, but they put the Sephora emblem on crooked which makes it look cheap. I will be returning this and looking for a more quality case."
3,A Solution Seeking A Problem?,"A good book with some solid approaches to consulting that many have found to be useful.The only downside, if you can call it that, is that quite a number of the solutions may not work well in a good number of real-world consulting assignments.Overall not a bad read and worth further investigation if you're looking for something to lead you step-by-step through solving certain client problems."
5,Hooray For The Original Weiss!,"Yay, the return of everyone's favorite Yoji Kudou, and the return of Ken. Of course, understanding Ken would be easier for the newbies if the OVA had been released in the US. *sighs*After 5 episodes of the Kyo's guilt-association, and Sena's whining, the rest of the gang - thankfully - returns!Aya is no longer left with one whiny *bleep*, but instead he gets his old pals, who are just as sexy as always!Gluhen really picks up once Ken and Yoji arrive, and I am sad to say that Yoji still has to kill off his girlfriends - poor guy.But hey, he gets to blow up a building!More clues are left as to Todo and his creator, and everyone who's seen the first series know where the Sena thing is going. *sighs* What is it with the Omi-like characters? it's kind of...weird.Enjoy! :)"
3,NICE PERFORMANCE - BUT NOT PROFESSIONAL,"I have been using this sander for 1 year + -:Here you have my comments:1- Works fine, the finish are Ok.2- After some weeks of used, Too much noise.(maybe normal for this kind of tool)3- I already repair it 1 time (minor repair).4- Looks very nice but is not a professional tool.5- Inside it, you are going to find just 1 ball bearing,the other one is a bushing.6- Very comfortable due to the gelmax.FinallyI f you need a sander for home, this is a five stars sander.(little expensive)But if you are looking for a pro tool, this is not the option.(try dewalt or craftsman pro)"
5,voices of angels,"If I could make a wish and have any person or group of persons materialize at my bedside and sing me to sleep, it would be Kitka. Their music is so beautiful that there are no words. It is only to be experienced. So get it for yourself. Let this astounding music wash over you."
4,Good plans at all sq ft levels,This is a good book of plans for one story homes. One story is the trend in homebuilding now because the baby boomers are finding it increasingly difficult to get up and down stairs and are looking to a long future as they age.The plans are presented two to a page so the blueprints are quite small and some of the type is unreadable. The index is simply in alphabetical order so not terribly helpful if you want to only look at say homes with basements or some other criteria.
2,Poor Execution,"This is the game that my son has wanted for some time (like a previous reviewer), and we were surprised by the delayed release dates. When it finally came out, the screen rate was far too choppy. I have tried to change some of the options, but the response is still fairly sluggish.My son is not the most particular of computer users, but I fear that he has already given up on this game. Seriously, I can't believe that Microsoft Flight Simulator X works so well on my computer but Star Trek Legacy appears to be junk.I am not much of a gamester myself, but I can say that it is very frustrating when the sound, video and controls are sloppy."
1,Double check your equipment requirements,"While I'm sure the game will run on the newest PCs capable of supporting the graphics, memory and processing demands of Windows Vista, if you have an older PC, bought sometime around 2002 running XP you may want to pay close attention to the hardware requirements necessary to even launch the game one time after installing it."
2,Disappointed,Much better alternatives from Armanda I & II to watching any star trek tv series episode or movie.
1,"Half Baked, Half Finished, Beta Version at Best","As so many other reviews have commented, this game is a complete waste of your money. From non-functioning multiplayer, music/sound skips, cut story lines, no introductions, all video scenes removed, notes in the gaming code from developers and abysmal keyboard controls that dont work correctly, non-working software with systems that meet the minimum requirements...All of these culminate into a game that was rushed out the door with too little time and too many budget cuts, by a company that borrowed heavily from it's aged Armada II graphics engine to save time, money, and investment...and it shows! In an age where a company's survival is dependant on customer satisfaction, this title indeed puts Bethesda Softworks and Mad Doc Software in the hot seat."
3,Not too bad...,"I'm not an avid gamer, but I am a terminal Trek fanatic. I was excited about this game coming out, since I could not load Starfleet Command 3 on my new PC with Windows XP.I find the game entertaining, if not a bit frustrating that you cannot save mid-mission (I must have replayed the 5th mission 10 times until I figured out how to warp all my ships).I do enjoy piloting the starships, and the combat action. However, like most other Trek PC games, they could have done a better job setting it up."
1,Waste Of Money,"Do not bother with this software. Gameplay is choppy, controls poorly thoughtout and terrible product support!"
4,not bad,"not bad for wat you pay for it, but another title that the compay could have done so much more with."
2,A disappointed Bethesda fan,"I've waited with great anticipation for this beautiful looking game to grace my computer, and now I wish I hadn't. Bethesda has made some great games in the past, such as Morrowind and Oblivion. But with the Star Trek franchise, they've dropped the ball pretty hard. Star Trek: Legacy for the PC is a challenge to play, not because it is difficult (it isn't), but because it has so many bugs and bad design decisions with which the player must fight just to PLAY the game.Until this game is patched up, it is not recommended for anyone."
1,"Will try to be nice about it, but to put it simple BUYER BEWARE","If you are a PC Gamer like me, dont even waste your time with this game. I got it, installed it and it was bug heaven. I patched it, made it a little better, but still the control scheme has alot of problems that need to be addressed. On a recommendation, I purchased a 360 controller and soon after install and setup, the games graphics were VERY unstable (choppy video) as well as you cannot configure any of the controls at all. Overall, and of course this is my opinion, this game is a disappointment to the Trek franchise as a whole, were I have seen games like Starfleet Command Vol 1, 2 and even 3 be more enjoyable as a ""spaceflight sim"". Dont waste your money, I wish I didnt."
2,It would be nice if they released a completed game!,"Well Bethesda did it again...all the potential in the world and they released an unfinished piece of junk! They did not even to bother to create a really cool space battle intro or anything. Besides being bug-filled and difficult to control, the missions are not good. Plus, you can not save unless you complete all the segments of a mission....what a joke. I think it is about time that these companies talk to us trekies (trekers) to see what we want in a game. The graphics are nice to look at but that is the solo redeeming quality (Thanks to a nice 512MG PCI-e card).The concept of the game was nice, but was poorly developed from there. Stay away from this one and maybe they will get on the ball and finish a project for once!"
2,PC Version Overrated. XBox Good,"Son is a trek fan and has most known trek PC game, does mods the whole nine yards. I even upgraded his PC video card in anticipation. According to him, through research, after the buy, this was an underdeveloped version of the XBox game (very good according to the blogs), and is not happy with it at all. He found one blog that the player actually threw it into the street and let a car run over it. Again, not happy. Shame on the company for doing a quick knock-off just to meet a release schedule. Purchased Encounters, a quick shootem up, which I even play, and he likes this cheaper game better."
5,Another perfect Lnegan record,"I love this record. I thought i was the only 'real' Lanegan fan until I heard ""One hundred days"" on Rescue Me a few episodes ago. It was a perfect fit on the show. I want to hear more Lanegan on the show. It works! One of my favorite songs on the album is ""Morning Glory Wine"". You either get it or you don't.Buy this if you like Lanegan at all! You must get this."
3,"Not completely my type of music, but still solid","I bought the album for the the songs ""Wedding Dress"" and ""100 Days"", which are amazing songs. However, I havnt found much else on the CD that I find myself liking very much. Not bad music, just not my personal preference. Still Recommended."
1,terrible,The seller didn't mention in the ad that the game was for Mac and not PC. I assumed it was for PC and now I own a game I will never be able to play. Thanks. Money grows on trees.
4,A girl in Texas loves this album.,"I'm not from Atlanta, but I have heard of a phenomenon named Angela Motter by word of mouth for some time and finally decided to get the album Pleasure and Pain. I found it to be all everyone said and more. Incredible! It has moved me like no other. Guess what's been in my car stereo for the last three months!"
4,Uncomplicated naughty fun,"Anyone familiar with the work of Tinto Brass can imagine the light romp in store here. This is perhaps my favourite of his naughty stories, as it does not try to be anything other than a lighthearted visual ride. From the opening scenes of everyone in a park up to some hanky panky, to the more steamy, sauna, lesbian scenes, the tone is just right for uncomplicated enjoyment. It seems everyone in Italy does not wear knickers, and a fine thing too.The bluray tranfer is noticeably better than the old DVD in my library."
1,Historically accurate but boring,"A book that lacks a good story base. Reading through this book I have acknowledged that the Author knew the history, but I was bitterly unsatisfied in how the book skipped through time, as though he was in a race to get it done. What also was dissapointing was that it brought characters into the book totally out of the blue. Im an 8th grader and this was required reading."
4,only swimming-pool details are missing,"Woodall's are great campground directories. The only thing that is missing is important information about the swimmingpool; heated or not, indoor or outdoor. Maybe Woodall will add this information next year."
2,mediocre grape leaves,"They are overcooked, tasteless, anybody that finds a raison or a pinenut gets a $10,000 prize."
3,BURN,"HAHA SCOTT!!! Weenie in a bottle wasnt written by weird al, But written by this hwan ryn guy BUUUUUUURRRRRRNNN!!!! u owe me ur guitar!!!!"
1,Poor Customer Support/Service,"The TV has a sleek look and is easy to use and set up. The picture quality is good as well. However, nine months after I bought this (and with only seven months of use), the picture went out. Sharp's customer service directed me to the nearest authorized contracted service center (70 miles away).After a look by the service center, Sharp offered me a replacement that was a rebuilt unit. Four months after I received the rebuilt unit, the picture died. When I called Sharp customer service back, their answer was, ""Sorry, but your 1 year warranty has expired."" To get the rebuilt unit fixed, I would have to pay for repairs myself.Very disappoininting since the rebuilt unit was less than five months old. I chose to purchase a new LCD from another manufacturer and skip the Sharp brand.From the looks of other reviewers, my TV might be the exception to quality, but that exception has cost me a lot of money."
2,Coat,"I liked the coat but it did not last, When I purchases there was a hole in pocket, and after only two seasons the zipper completely stopped working, always had trouble with it. I feel it should have lasted alot longer without zipper had to throw out."
4,very good fishing instructions,"Very good for beginners and advanced walleye fisherman. Shows very useful techniques as well as what kind of tackle works best for different situations. Some parts kind of hard too understand, sometimes have to rewind and listen again to get it all. All and all it is really worth the money."
5,"Super Links-KEEP THEM IN STOCK, PLEASE","As a vegetarian, I have enjoyed Worthington's Super Links for years. Last summer (2008), they became very difficult to find in ANY local stores and I got nowhere with the company when I tried to find a place to buy/order them. One day, I tried a search on Amazon, found them listed and before I could order, they were out of stock, much to my disappointment. However, Amazon was wonderful as they sent me an email to let me know they were back in stock, at which time I ordered a case. THANKS, Amazon!!!As for the product, we enjoy them broiled or grilled. They are simply the best tasting hot dog substitute on the market."
1,"High fat, highly processed fake food","Tastes great, but 64 percent of the calories are from fat! Yikes! This is a highly processed product. It's not ""health food"" or healthy for you, don't let them kid you."
1,Da Vinci Roxanne Changing Table- Terrible!,"We purchased this changing table for our infant daughter and while it looks great from a style standpoint, the thing is poorly constructed and has inherent problems. Namely, when we first bought it, the drawers literally started falling apart. The ""wood"" came apart and the drawers are continually coming out of alignment. The hardware that was used for the tracks that the drawers rest on is complete garbage. They bend easily.. and we're not talking about heavy stuff we're storing. This is light baby clothing for Pete's sakes. The European ""turn screw bolts"" that hold the corners of the drawer are continually coming loose and falling out, very frustrating. My husband finally resorted to gluing the drawers. I wouldn't recommend this at all. For the money, there has to be something out there that is constructed better."
4,The instructions are bizarre!!,"The instructions were hard to follow and saying in some pictures there were 4 drawers, some there were 3. If you are relying on the directions... good luck. Plus the assembly is quite intricate if you are not used to that type of thing. Luckily, I had help to put it together. Assembly time was approx. 2 hours. I am quite satisfied with the quality- it is very sturdy, which when pulling out the parts I wasn't so sure it would be. The stain and finish is really nice as well. I bought a Pottery Barn crib and they both look like they are from the same manufacturer- I am very impressed with that. I highly recommend this changing table, if you are experienced with IKEA like assembly. Although I do wish the bottom of the drawers were a little sturdier- I worry that over time or with too much weight put in them they will start to sag. We will see.... they do slide in/out very smoothly, though."
1,Alcino,"I agree with Paul e Vasconcelas that it is unfortunate I have to comment on what was said here and not on the book...On the other hand - I TOTALLY disagree with almost all of his statements. The Continental Portuguese, in no way, are constantly trying to grasp onto any ""Anglo"" identity (USA is not the only country containing people of Portuguese descent!). It might be possible that he has met Continental-Portuguese-Americans who appear to do this; unfortunately many people have been misguided about their heritage in order to fit into their new adoptive country. To make an example, there are many Americans who claim an Irish heritage, and can pin point a vast amount of detail, when infact they descend from Italy - it is hard to accept something new when you have been taught the opposite from birth.Instead of explaining my views on this subject, I will rather say that Camoes and Edward Van Dun (two other reviewers on this page) express a very accurate point on this subject."
1,I can't give it 0 Stars,"Don't [buy] this book. I don't know if this book is reflective of the general work that Brady Games does with their game guides, but it does a terrible job.I like having a game guide when I play sports games to look up player stats, make a substitution, etc. -- it beats having to go through several screens in real time when you're not familiar with the team.Problem is that all the STATS in the NBA2K guide book ARE blatantly INCORRECT. Many players have percentage statistics over 100%, that don't match up to the other numbers, free throws made higher than the number of attempts, etc. We're not talking about a couple of typos/errors (which should be unacceptable for what I paid for this book). We're talking whole scale errors.I did write a letter to Brady Games to bring these inaccuracies to their attention (several months ago). They never responded to my letter."
5,I RAN A MARATHON!,"I decided to run a marathon after joining Team In Training so in addition to what TNT gave me, I needed guidance so I searched for a book. This book was it!I had ALWAYS hated to run and had quit smoking less than a year before I decided to do this.This book was an amazing tool in my training. I am not sure I would have been as successful (or successful at all) without it.It showed you everything mentally and physically.I completed the marathon 2 days ago!!"
2,Mixed,"The positives - This book is very good in helping you deal with the mental hurdles of training for a marathon.There are a lot of good visualization suggestions, some of which I've put to good use.The Negative (and this is a biggie) - They give out completely wrong information regarding stride. The authors say that a heel strike is okay but forefoot striking should be avoided. Actually it's just the opposite. A heel strike puts enormous pressure on your knees and has the effect of putting on the brakes with each step.I'm Exihibit A. I was a heel striker. My knees started bothering me so much (all of the time) I thought I was going to have to give up running. But I tried barefoot running on a beach, switched to a minimalist shoe and, most importantly, changed to a forefoot strike - and my constant knee pain immediately disappeared.I was astounded (and felt like I was reading a very dated book) when I saw the authors advocating such a poor striding form."
5,Used it and completed my marathon,"I read the book, used the training plan contained within, and finished my first marathon at the Marine Corps Marathon on 31 Oct 2010.Are you thinking about running your first marathon? Great!Do you have an expected finish time?You shouldn't.Your goal is to train up, start a marathon and finish a marathon. If it means you have to crawl over the finish line to finish, then that's what you have to do. Having a finishing time goal in mind is counter productive, and can diminish your feeling of satisfaction from completing your first marathon.Now, after reading this book, and finishing my first marathon, I think anybody (of reasonable, normal health) can do a marathon; and that it is truly a matter of mind and will, and less a matter of feet and legs. This book approaches it from the mind and willpower aspect, and less as a matter of feet and legs."
2,why is everyone so positive?,"In regard to review number 42""Promises more than it should?, June 7, 2003""I think this dude has got it spot on, you need to take your time in building a running base to ensure you lessen the chance of causing injury or just start completely hating running right from the start.""For sedentary people, a good month of rigorous exercise short of running would be a smart start, followed by a very gradual walk/run program, until you can run 3 miles a few months down the road. Anything faster is courting injury.""I just wanna ask a question why is everyone so positve in these amazon reviews? and if someone says something that is sensible and actually worthwhile people dont find the review useful? 24 out of 42 people found that review useful? I think its the most sensible review out you all at least it doesnt sound like he/she was paid for their review like some of the other advertisements passed off as reviews."
1,not good,I am training for marathon for next year -- this book seems like it is over train - I am 42 80 lbs overweight -- However I do walk everyday and lift weights twice a week -- I can see doing that much that fast -- I am not a sedentary person -- but I have too question for someone my age doing this -- I am reading other books -- I used to run about 10 years ago -- and now I had to stop working because I have brain disease -- it leaves me time to work out and train for marathon --I am discouraged with this book -- I can see injury -- I had plantar fasciitis years ago when I was running -- I am very careful about my shoes and socks -- i really don't think this is right for me -
5,Looking forward to it,This book has good information on training for marathons.I am looking forward to mine in Dec.
5,faithfulGod,This was an awesome and poignant read. I could not put this book down. The author has such an amazing testimony!
4,Do unto others .....,Faith under fire is truly in eye opener on many levels God does give us signs lots of people look for burning bushes when in fact they're simplier than that as LaJoyce recounted toward how she came through the fire more blessed than when the devil ignited that fire. You also learn just how much thicker family ties are in life & death.
5,Informative,"This book was very informative. It opens up your eyes to deception. Also, that we must seek God when looking for a spouse. Only He alone knows the intention and motives of people. We only know by what we see and what the person allows us to know. Pray, Pray, Pray. The scripture says, in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path. When we surrendered our lives to God, it meant every area including our personal lives. Let Him choose for you."
5,Incredibly Powerful,"LaJoyce and I were working together as hosts of a cable TV show when she met 'Prince Charming'. She was glowing as she began living the fantasy that every woman dreams of. Little did she know that the man who brought so much joy into her Life could also be bringing her Death.""Faith Under Fire"" shows the depth of true commitment and the power of God at work in the Lives of his children. It proves that science, medicine and absolute evil, are no match for God's will. Reading LaJoyce's account of how she continued to take care of her husband and find the strength to forgive him, caused me to ask myself if my faith was as strong. This book will touch all your emotions, but most of all it will inspire. And in spite of himself, Steven contributed to a legacy of Love and HIV-awareness which LaJoyce tirelessly advocates today."
3,The book arrived in a timely manner. It was not in as good of condition as I expected.,The sale ad did not make it clear that the book was a large hard-cover book. I expected the trilogy as three books.
1,Not adjustable!,"I love the design of all of the mobiles in the Wendy Bellissimo collections; however they do not fit on all cribs and they should be made to be adjustable to fit a variety of crib styles, since there are SO many out there. I was so disappointed to finally be able to purchase since they had relaunched them and then to pay $50.00 for one and get it home and it not fit I was DEVASTATED! Now, I can't find a mobile to match the theme I chose! Cute designs but not practical! Before you purchase make sure that you don't have a thick railing on the top or sides of the crib, the pole does not extend and will hang too far into the crib. It does not work well on the new popular sleigh cribs, just an FYI!"
5,This book has great ideas for parents to help their kids,This book opened my eyes to the alternatives that are available for children with cerebral palsy. I have tried one of the methods with my son and he has made incredible progress
4,Drawing Couples Made Easier!,"Being a comic artist, one needs to know how to draw people at their most happy moments. Things like holding and kissing aren't exactly easy but after buying this book, it bacame easier. This book provides a strong basis to do you own thing. Over all this book was informative and with its great instructions and pictures, it is a must for any one who likes to draw."
5,Best Ever Raspberry Chai Tea,"This Raspberry Chai Tea is the best combination of flavors and spices of any chai tea I have tasted. And the added fact that it does not irritate my 73 yr. old stomach as others do, makes me determined to keep it in my cupboards. I really enjoy serving it to my friends. When I checked recently it was not available. I certainly hope we will be able to obtain it again soon. Otherwise, I'll be demoted to drinking hot chocolate.:-("
1,"An expensive paperweight!!!! When I purchased this item through Amazon, the watch did not function when I received it!","I received an Omeag Seamaster Planet Ocean men's watch from my wife for Christmas 2010. She had purchased this watch back in Febrary as it is so expensive. Well, this hunk of metal is nothing but a very expensive paperweight!!!! The seller, Authentic Watches, informed me that this product purchased from them, required refurbishment, and I should remit $450.00 to them! When I mentioned that the watch was not working when I received it, I was told, too bad!!!!"
2,Sam Cook? Hello?,"The entire film hinges on the song ""Change Is Gonna Come,"" by the great Sam Cook, yet it does not appear on this release? Come on now."
1,Waste of Time,Sorry I didn't take the time to check each song listed before the purchase. I enjoyed the movie so much I felt the CD would represent the songs I heard. Not one hit I was looking for was on the CD. A waste of money!
4,Great starter pinball machine,"I got this pinball machine for my 4 1/2 and 7 year olds and they love it. I've played it too. You can make it easy by pushing up the ""blocks"" to help keep the ball in play, or harder by leaving them down. It keeps score and has the ability for 2 players. It's not flimsy like so many other pin ball machines. And it's a decent table top size. A very good buy and a lot of fun."
1,no bliss here,"I found this book full of mistakes and words printed over and over again, also I think that the author was very self centered. I did not find any bliss or enlightment at all. I think that she came across as bitter and angry."
2,fun toy,"I brought this toy as I present for my 20 ,omth son to play with after minor surgery he was having. I loved it right from the beginning. We take other car, planes basically anything on wheels and use it at the airport. His twin sister also has fun with it and it is a big enough toy that they can play at the same time. We really like this toy."
5,Great fun with or without lights,"My youngest son just got this for his 2nd birthday - though we got the version with the sounds and lights (picked it up on clearance at a discount store, I didn't realize it was so hard to find until reading these reviews). My older kids (3 and 5) love the sounds and lights, but my 2 year old would play with it just as much without them - he often doesn't bother to turn it on (get it out of ""sleep"" mode) and still has just as much fun. The vehicles are fun to play with and he loves to touch and move all the little parts (spin the umbrella, open the ""x-ray"" machine, turn the baggage holder, etc). It's been the most popular of all the toys he got for his birthday - even with the older kids. I personally like the idea of getting rid of the sounds and lights and making the toy slightly cheaper. I often take batteries out of my kids toys anyway because the noise gets to be too annoying. We love this airport!"
4,Lots of opportunity for imaginary play,"My older son received this toy for Christmas (he was 25 months old at the time) and LOVED IT! We have the lights and sounds version which is completely unnecessary. Both of my boys (2-1/2 and 17 months) now sit and play with it together. They use other Little People play sets with it, or random cars, trains, trucks and boats on the little road and runway. When they want to hear the sounds, unfortunately my 2-1/2 yr old gets very frustrated. If the noise in the area is too loud, the toy will not pick up the movement of the vehicles. Radios, TVs, air conditioning or another crying/yelling child all can contribute to the problem. Also, the toy is 7 months old and I have to ""restart"" the sounds and lights from sleep mode by turning it upside down and switching it off and on. Annoying. It is relatively big compared to other Little People play sets, but it is the one they play with most often - followed closely by the farm and the garage."
5,Our son's favorite toy!,"We bought this for our son's third birthday and he LOVES it! He also has the zoo and the train so when we have it all set up it takes up most of the floor. But he takes all his Little People to the airport on the train then they fly to the zoo.My only complaint is that the airport is pretty big and can't not be broken down with out breaking the clips so make sure you have storage for it.Other than that, it offers hours of fun play and imagination."
4,delirioustutterfunk,"most drum and bass sounds like a b-grade sci-fi flick in a food processor. this is warm, glowing, fat-faced bass that snakedrills itself into your head in long steady grooves. it's like watching THX 1138 (an a-grade sci-fi flick) on fast forward with your ears."
3,OK,"I am a big fan of Genevieve Foster's horizontal history.I was a little disappointed in this book though - I thought it was very informative on Caesar's portion, but conjectured on the history of other things going on at the time. Not my favorite book of her's."
2,Would have been great if it hadn't broken first time I used it,What a great concept - folding wooden rocking chair for those of us who don't have a lot of storage space. But the first time it was used the wood under the right armrest just split with minimal pressure from my arm. I was so disappointed but was hesitant to exchange it for another one because I think the design is conducive to it splitting there again.If they could fortify the wood under armrest I would buy it in a heartbeat.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Doctor Who - Terminus is part of the overall story of the Black Guardian trying to do not so nice things to the good old Doctor. In this case, the fifth doctor.This is the middle book of those three.The TARDIS has been sabotaged, which leaves Nyssa and the Doctor end up on a spaceship, which is en route to a space station called Terminus, supposedly at the centre of the universe."
5,My friend,"I have met Ginger on line and we have become good friends. She has a sultry style and uses her life experiences to create a vrey soulful cd. Bought her first album and will get her next one which she promised to sign for me. Watch for her in Vegas in January. I will be there so we can meet and talk. She has a beautiful personality and I love hre music. I love ""Crazy Old Lady"""
3,"Okay, but not good enough","I ordered this spatula and a Wilton '9 inch' spatula together. They turned out to be the same size. I might have been satisfied if this had arrived alone, but next to the Wilton it seemed flimsy, and its handle isn't nearly as comfortable. Back it went."
4,Love the phone,"Great phone AT&T needs a less expensive rate plan, date,blackberry and minutes in a single plan. The phone is a great product especially at the price, I'm getting thru most of the learning curve."
3,Dubious bearing quality - be careful,"After reading previous reviews about the quality of the bearings on live centers (I bought 3 different live centers at once from PSI), the first thing I did was just turn it by hand. Amazing how this could have left China never mind PSI... it was junk. The bearing just crunched (for want of a better word) as it turned. Since I live in Philly and so are they, and I didnt want to send back in the post for a replacement and get another one also of dubious quality, I drove round to their place and got it replaced and tested before I left the building. Me and the guy who I was dealing with went through at least 5 others before I came across a good one.I would have given this product 1 star, but because PSI was accomodating in replacing it with a decent one, I give 3.I would have replaced the bearing myself but it looked too much of a challenge."
2,Enthusiasts guide review - for older cars,"Found many of the articles dated over ten years old and where some withstand the test of time, most are relative to the older, now very used cars.Rate a 2 star due to historical perspectiveCaveat Emptor"
1,Be prepared to re-write,"I purchased this book about a year ago to assist in a job search I was doing. Initially, I was very excited; I felt the strategies made sense and the results were positive changes in my resume.Unfortunately, the recruiting industry may not be ready for this radical change in resume strategies. Nearly 100% of the people who responded to my resume submissions said ""You have a great skill set, but I really need this resume re-done in a traditional, chronological style."" Who knows how many never bothered to respond?Some of the information in the book is valuable, especially the keyword mapping items, but it certainly is not worth the price tag."
5,"Great, but let's have book 5 already","I've passed this series onto at least 15 people. All of them very different, some never have read SF before and all still loved it. One of the best series I've ever read, but the one question everyone keeps asking me is........When is DG going to finish the series? Not at all fair to those of us that have read every word ever published by DG. Please, finish the series."
1,poor book,The book is very poorAnd I do not recommend purchaseBook where there is no new information at all
4,Get this book !,"I have checked out many books on analysis. Many don't even come close to the way Prof. Clark describes elementary analysis. The examples he gives are very good. They won't drive you to crazy :) The explanation of the topics disussed is quite good. I have used Spivak's text Calculus. In comparsion, though Spivak tends to be a bit more verbose. He does give a lot of examples. Colin's explainations tend to be a bit terse but it is still very under standable. I bought this book 'cuase I like it better than Spivak's text. Any book that has a chapter called ""Three Hard Theorems"" might scare you away. Buy the book by Wilson !"
2,I HATE bad translation...,"""In the version of the film that was re-edited for foreign distribution, this becomes painfully clear. Figuring non-Japanese wouldn't understand the period detail, 40 minutes of essential exposition on character's motivations and background information were cut from the film, essentially reducing Gojoe to a pointless, 91-minute action scene."" -exerpt taken from a review on MidnightEye.comTHAT is exactly why the movie was so horrible and utterly confusing. I'd like to see what the additional 40 minutes of footage entailed. And what a horrible reason to chop up a film. The assumption that westerners wouldn't understand the history. It's not at all a complex or metaphoric movie, and in my opinion, it would've been better off here in the states if it had stayed in it's original presentation."
2,I think I just saw a movie...,"What can you say? No really what *can* you say about Gojoe?I did understand the plot, rambling and strange as it was, but I doubt the casual viewer would be able to figure it out. I watched the uncut version, it felt a lot longer than it was, and I was still left with the feeling that vital scenes were left out. The best way to put it is that I got it, I get it, it just doesn't make any real sense.It's sort of a hybrid between a Buddhist version of the Exorcist, a Samurai movie, and a slasher film. It fails at all of them, creating something that tries to be enlightening in among the sprays of blood.I give it two stars for being occasionally pretty, though even here it can get downright confusing and weird."
2,Conquer your critical inner voice,"I find it difficult to complete excerises that are not in sequence with the text. It would have helpful to excerises located internally...otherwise, good content and helpful particularly with significant other."
2,Work book partially filled out,"The book was in over all good shape, I don't remember being told it had been partially used. It was done in ink so you really can't erase it."
4,Not A Bad Album,"this cd is well produced by one of the famous producer in hawaii Brett Fovargue. Some cuts are her own compositions while others come under the overworked category of ""island music."" It has nice instrumentation with the likes of GAry Nakano on trumpet and Casey Olsen on steel guitar. Fiji is always at his best even as a back up vocal!The lyrics are alright .Although, Kanai's voice is some-what Generic. This is a class debut album. The musician deserves the credit!"
1,SHE STINKS!!,"HEY! BRETT FORVAGUE, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF LETTING THIS GIRL SING AND YOUR NAME BEING ON HER LABEL AS THE PRODUCER? SHE SHOULD HAVE SANG, 'MIS. NO GOOD' INSTEAD OF 'MR NO GOOD'. I AGREE WITH A FEW OF THESE REVIEWERS, THAT SHE CAN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN THAT!? BUT, BRETT YOU DID A TERRIFIC JOB WITH THE BEAT FOR SOME OF THE SONGS.YOU STILL IS THE BEST PRODUCER FOR ALL POLYNESIAN. PERSONALLY, I THINK THE MICRONESIAN SINGS WITH THEIR NOSE OR SOMETHING. IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD. ALWAYS PICK THE POLYNESIAN GIRLS TO BE THE VOCALIST FOR ALL YO ALBUM CAUSE,THEY GOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL VOICE. . .JUST STICK WITH FIJI, HE'S THE MAN!:-)"
1,NO GOOD TEINE!!,"I own this cd and i regret that i bought it. I love island music but, her singing voice isn't appealing with the music. Palau is a beautiful paradise even the video proves it. Too bad her voice isn't as appealing as the music that brett forvague produce. If you ever read this Brett, next time write all her music for her or just get a better singer. No offense to Virian"
1,THE SAME OLD FAKE-GANGSTA ATTITUDE,"T.I WOULDN'T IMPRESS ME UNTIL HE STARTS MAKIN' POSITIVE MUSIC. GANGSTA RAP IS A DISGRACE IN THE HIP-HOP INDUSTRY. WE NEED MORE ANTI-GOVERMENT RAPPERS, MORE POSITIVE RAPPERS,FUN RAPPERS, NOT THESE SENSELESS DOPE-HEAD GANGSTA RAPPERS...THEY'RE TEACHING YOUNG TEENS HOW TO SMOKE, DRINK, KILL, RAPE, HAVE SEX WITH MULTIPLE PARTNERS, BE A THUG, BE A HOE, AND SELL DRUGS."
1,bad buy!,when i receive this cd it was scratched up really really bad and it was shipped to me wrapped in cheap paper instead of being shipped to me properly wrapped and placed in an album cover.
4,Took me two times to enjoy,"I listened to the CD and nothing really jumped out at me. Big Things poppin is really the only ""catchy/mainsteam song"" on here. Thats a good thing cause the second time I played the CD I liked it better. I dont think its TI's best effort, but its pretty good. The eminem song (Touchdown) was really dissapointing for Eminem and T.I., but the JAY-Z song made up for that. Good CD I liked it alot better than that ""King"" crap. That had couple mainstream songs that were decent but the rest was lame. I guess everbody in Atlanta has some real good stuff now to ride around and bump in their CD player. I know I will have this in heavy rotation here in NC right beside the new Redman CD. Good CD check it out."
2,just aight,"no matter what name or alter ego T.I. goes by or does, he just doesn't have the rapping skills to pull off the type of undertakings he aspires to. thus far in his career beats and Production have moved me far more than what T.I. has put out. he is conssitant with staying to a formula that has worked and I don't expect him to change anytime soon. despite name Artists and Producers on board here this Album is just aight. he is the ""IT"" Cat of the moment in Rap with Films,Endoresements,tv,(Espn plays his songs)etc... but on his albums i just don't get all the hype. neither Person on this album sounds that much different from the other."
5,Amazing Difference!,"You really have to try one of these to believe it. Compared to diving with a standard mouthpiece, there is virtually no jaw fatigue or soreness. I never want to dive without one again."
3,very interesting,As a pastor I was asked to read this book which countered the book by the Happy Hunters. I was skeptical but since it was written by his well educated daughter who was his music director I'm not so sure he didn't talk with angels. I talked with a local pastor where he was named Dave Roper about him. Dave said he was a wonderful man but thought he lost his mind over a period of months. I don't know but it's worth good reading.
5,A MUST Have,AL Green Rocks Here.The SOngs Are Timeless.HIS VOice is So SOULFUL.The Music is So Powerful.The Arrangements&Production Hold Up.AL GREEN IS A GENIUS&LIVING LEGEND.
2,Running Low On Art History,"Highly biased toward both Western art and Christianity, this book ignores a treasure trove of interesting facts about the paintings it discusses. For example, the Arnolfini Wedding Portrait is included, without one word of its symbolism or the ""story behind the story."" Very little information is included about the interesting lives of the artists as well. The book should be retitled ""How Christianity and Dead White Men Changed the World."""
1,"Bad Customer Service , defected parts","My Plumber noticed cartridges are leaking. I contacted the company to get replacement parts for the cartridges, but they asked me to send the whole system back to them so that they can take a look at it. It would cost me money and time. I saved time by returning the item and purchase another brand."
1,Watts is cheap,"Hello, having owned a Watts unit for more than a year, I can tell you that their product is not only cheaply made, but you cannot buy universal membranes and filters. It may seem like a deal until you have to buy new filters. The membrane especially is pricey. And you can only get it from Watts. Also, their faucet is junk. My started leaking just after the warranty was up. And it makes me made I've had to send it off to the landfill and buy a new one. What a waste. Cheap products fill our landfills. Thanks, Watts.Trust me, folks, this may seem like a deal, but wait until you use your unit and have to get the membrane. I also read a review that Dow and GE membranes are the best. You can't put one of those in a Watts unit. I will not be cheap with clean water. If you're going to the trouble to filter your water - our most important resource - doesn't it make sense to buy the best?"
1,$235 down the drain!,"I purchased the WP5-50 and went through three months of hell before throwing it in the trash! First, the hissing noise had to be solved by Watts sending me a bypass for the system. Thirty days later, the system quit. I paid someone to test my water pressure. I had Watts to send me a replacement shut off valve. Finally, I paid $18 to have it shipped back to Watts to be repaired and was told that I needed to replace all of the filters and the membraine because something in my water or the water pressure had clogged up the filters (it had only been in use 60 days). I am now waiting for the system to be mailed back to me so that I can put it in the trash. I will never buy a Watts product again in my life. $235 down the drain! (no pun intended)"
4,Watts WP5-50 Premier Gets Wife's Seal of Approval,"Purchased the Watts WP5-50 Premier one month ago because the water taste and clarity is poor in FL. Install was moderately easy. Only text install information was provided. A system graphic showing the finished system connections and tubing colors would have been very helpful and made install much easier.Ran the start-up procedures and then introduced it to the wife's official taste test. She had rejected the previous 2 systems that did not have as many filters or R/O. She approved this water completely. She is happy, therefore I am happy.The only cons: (otherwise 5 stars)1. Need graphics for install.2. 30% of incoming water is rejected as 'brine' and run down the drain. I need to devise a way to capture this water and use elsewhere and eliminate this waste."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. I saw the original telenovela ""Corazon Salvaje"" back in 1993 and I was expecting to see the entire thing. The fact that it was only 1 dics with 280 minutes should've been enough of a warning. This DVD only shows fragments of episode that if you had not seen the original you would not understand the plot, get to know the characters, and end up completely lost.I do not recommend buying this DVD."
2,"Love the Novela, Not the DVD",I absolutely loved this novela when it came out and was so excited to see it available on DVD. When I watched it I was so disappointed on how fragmented the novela was.It left out so many crucial scenes that I had wished I never bought it. I wish they had said on the profile that the DVD was an edited condensed version.Highly disappointed and I would not recommend buying this DVD.
1,Thank you for the Warnings,"I was so excited to see that these novelas were on dvd now. As I read all the reviews I was informed that they are not the complete novelas. I'm so disappointed. I will not be buying these dvd's thanks to the reviews. I would rather wait and hopefully get to see the day when we can have the whole novelas on dvd, even if it has to be a two or three dvd box set. They are well worth it. Until then I will keep my fond childhood memories of them and keep hoping. Thank you all for taking the time to do the reviews. I hope someone in Televisa can get their heads together and make this happen."
5,mbula e'beti ngai .,"I like congo music very much so most of the albums got lost from me long ago . So I would like to re-record them back again , but geting it tough for me . Will appreciate if can have this opportunity once again in my live."
4,ROWDY -- I CAN BELIEVE YOU'RE STILL ALIVE!,"I'm a casual wrestling fan having watched it on and off for the last thirty years. ""In the Pit"" is a VERY easy read with insight in the world of wrestling but mostly its about him. I have a great deal of respect for Rowdy Piper because its clear he didn't compromise his integrity!!!! His story goes into great detail about the extensive good times, the bond between fellow athletes and quick behind the scenes look (i.e. lack of health benefits and how controlling the promoters are) -- which I wish he would have expanding on. Yet the story is very compelling and revealing, as his stories are positively hysterical. The book is entertaining but it does to jump around a bit. It is indeed written in true in Rowdy fashion, its as if he and I were sitting in bar and him recounting his roller coaster life. After I put I down, I was left with two thoughts -- 1) God Bless His Wife Kitty and 2) I hope he writes another book soon."
2,Disappointing,"After all the hype, this book is just like all the rest, just a bunch of hoopla. I wish someone would tell the real story of pro wrestling and tell all the dirt."
3,"Good book for children, too elementary for adults","I used this book as a child to learn piano. I remember liking it. Years later, I got a piano and bought this book again. It has a few nice pieces. However, most of the arrangements are no famous pieces but made for the purpose of teaching certain skills. Maybe I found it too easy, but it was far less interesting to play as an adult. The remaining books of the series use pieces adapted from famous composers, and hence are more melodic and enjoyable to play."
1,A Good Book for Those Not Interested in Learning the Piano,"This is a very old-fashioned book that lacks solid organization, does not encourage... Oh, what's the use! I can't go on about all of the things wrong with this book. A lot of teachers use it because that's the book they learned on. Remember, though: most piano teachers are terrible. Really! My advice is to learn from someone who has had concert and session experience and is teaching in their semi-retirement. They won't use a boring, badly-organized and soul-killing book like this."
2,Honest Business (Shambhala Pocket Editions),"Be advised: Product Dimensions: 4.5 x 3 x 0.5 inchesWhile I enjoy the book Honest Business, the Shambhala Pocket Edition isreally, really small.If you know this, and want it then fine. I was surprised when I got thispostage stamp sized book.I know, I know. I should have read the fine print.Well, it was too small.Again: I love the book, am displeased with the Shambhala Pocket Edition."
5,Phenomenal artistic video capturing the essence of Lake Tahoe,"A phenominal artistic achievement. Mulry takes you through a photographic extavaganza capturing the seasons of Lake Tahoe as though you were there. Photography, editing and music combine to make the complete experience more than enjoyable. It is mesmerizing. It is an inspiring, moving and relaxing experience, perfect with its spellbinding natural beauty and serene musical score. Share this absorbing experience of one of Mother Nature's greatest gifts with your children, parents, family and friends. Of all the attempts to capture the magic of Lake Tahoe, this one stands out and sets a new standard."
2,disappointing,"I had great expectations for this book, but I have to say they have not been met. Some of the exercises are extremely simple; many of the others are difficult, vague, or ill-defined. Also, the exercises don't match up conveniently with chapters of the accompanying text. You have to poke around in the homework problems of the text to find what exercises may go with those chapters. They're not in the same order as the text, and there are many chapters in the text that have no exercises associated with them. Also, the exercises don't ask for any analysis on the students' part--they just have a list of steps for the students to check off."
4,very good!,"i have 2 say , this is a great improvemennt 4 e! e and svu are very realistic but somewhat shocking. o well c'est la vie... sarah mourns over her superstrict father and her boyfriend problems. it was a good book but dint say much about liz!"
2,"Boring, repetative.","I got the game to try it out and I was disappointed. It was basically throw the knife at the bad guy over and over again for like 9 levels. I really wouldn't play it again, ever."
1,Complete and utter rubbish,"This novel was a total disappointment, it consisted of little more than the anti-Semitic rants of an embittered old man. There was no plot and the story just rambled on without reaching an exiting conclusion. I feel that the author needs to seek a new career path as his literary skills are severely lacking. This book is a real bore and will make frustrating reading for most readers."
4,Great!,"It was a little tricky finding the correct sizing, the measurments didn't seem to match up however I just picked whatever since the elastic waist sounded strechy. My son loved this when he opened it Christmas morning, he insisted on wearing it all day. I tryed to fluff it in the dryer to get out the stiffness and the two metal stars fell off, but I love the velcro closure and all the other badges/patches that made it seem realistic to a 5yr old. It was a great price compared to other sites that sell similar items for more(and they didn't have the hat too)and the shipping was cheap and fast. I hope it will last for a hand-me-down to the other kids.EDIT: 10/2010 Several years later and this dress up items is still a hit! It has survived three boys, dog drool and lots of washing."
2,Torn first month we had it,"I really liked the costume when we first received it, it fit my son really well. But, after he had played in it for about a month one of the seams torn and with the type of material that it is made out of you cannot fit it."
5,Costume was perfect! Exactly what we were looking for.,"costume was great, son loved it fit was roomy and great for all the Halloween runnong around, seemed to hold up well for the one time use without damage and ready for amother year!"
3,"Not Bad, Good Price","I ordered these to replace the levers on my old bike with something a little more cozy. They're pretty solid and the installation wasn't bad. The only issue I had with installation was when I set them up initially: make sure you put the cable through the guide in the right direction, or the lever will chew up your cable housing. Once I got it in right, there were not any more problems.*UPDATE*A few more days and they've started chewing up the cable housing again. I solved this by adding caps to the end of the cable housing, but I'm still a little annoyed at having to take apart my brakes again."
2,"good brakes, bad hoods","I purchased these levers for my commuter bike, so not looking to go lightweight, just functional and long lasting. The lever part works fine, unfortunately both hoods have split right at the outer seam where the logo resides. Standard handlebar tape job and the hoods were barely stretched. I tried getting Niagara Cycle Works to take them back since they're obviously defective, no such luck. So if you decide to go with these brake levers, don't put much handlebar tape anywhere under the hood."
3,"Good shaver, was better before improvements",This is a good clipper. The newer version however does not glide over bare skin as well as the older version did. It also has a tendency to catch skin on occasion. The older blades were much smoother to the touch. The newer blade tip is very rough to the touch.
5,excellent all around navigation teacher,"This book is well written for the both the novice and someone needing to freshen up and ""relearn"" what info. managed to escape their aged brain."
3,"Cool, but felt kinda jipped","I love the music of Maze, but on this CD, you don't get the full-length of the songs as you've heard on the radio. On some songs either, the intro is cut short, or and ending is cut short. Sound quality is fine, but felt jipped when not hearing the full version of the song as expected."
4,O.K. Primer,"A plain vanilla introductory text suitable for students who find themselves taking a musical theater course to fill an elective. Because young people are less familiar with the history and art of musical drama than film, the highly accessible prose and tabloid formatting of this text would make it useful in a college as well as high school course. Readers who already count themselves as students of the theater, on the other hand, can not afford to miss Gerald Mast's comprehensive and savvy history, ""Can't Help Singin'."""
3,shipping issues render purchase useless,"A useful history of the American musical theatre form. Only gripe? It took 3 weeks to arrive, making the purchas completely unnecessary given the timetable for research I was bound to. I had presumed 2 weeks was ample lead time to receive the book. Alas, it was not to be. It sits on my shelf unused."
3,reasonable sunglasses,"Very light and confortable, but with a very fragile and easy to scratch ""feel"". Also, the ""Competivision"" lens that claim to filter all colors but yellow seem to be quite overrated to me (I use them exclusively to play tennis and don't really notice any major diference from other lenses)."
3,Reason To Look,"It seems to me,that Bob Miller's writting ""alway's present"" reason for one to look inside him or herself.As well as the kind of World we are living in today.Thank's Bob"
2,"Just because it's true, I don't have to like it.","A few years ago, I read a review about another book by this same author: ""The statements in this book question the reality of the experiences. The words contain enough truth to bring tears to your eyes. A must read for an in-depth look in to the soul of mankind.""I'm sorry. I hate redundancy too, but this old review says exactly how I feel about this book. I've done a little research on this author, and I don't like him as a person, but he has paid his dues. Each time I think of him, his books, articles or speeches, I think of what William Blake the English poet, 1757-1827 said, ""He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence.""As I read this book, I didn't have a difficult time understanding why the Secret Service had locked him away in a VA hospital for being a possible threat to former President George H.W. Bush, 1990-91. What I don't understand is why they released him."
3,"Jane and John Write, Actually Write","Steve Almond and Julianna Baggott should be congratulated for the back and forth concept they used. Fun. The little book was fun, Jon and Jane writing alternating letters to reveal their loves and lives to one another. A method of exploration from afar.The book almosts works but it just isn't great. Some letters are fun and some sad. This isn't bad it just didn't work the way I hoped when I read a newspaper articule on the book. It is an easy fast read, so give it a try. A lot of reviewers seem to like it more than me."
2,pretty disappointing,"I'm a huge John Hiatt fan, but this is not one of his better efforts. He's a master story-teller, but for some reason the stories here just aren't terribly compelling. If you're new to John Hiatt's work you'll be much happier with Walk On, or The Tiki Bar Is Open."
2,Shock stud extender,Threads on the shock stud extender didn't match the threads on my shock.i should of check the threads on my shock before ordering.
4,the caballero's advenures by Bart Fox,"The battle between Loreli and Yellow comes to an end.After that,Erika joins up with Yellow and they find Red! Or do they? I give the book 4 stars because of the action.But did it ever come to you that Yellow resembles that girl in Part 3,Number 5."
1,Stay away from it,"Inflate forever and it deflates itself in one night. You also have to buy 4 additional BIG batteries yourself. It leaks all the time and I don't know how to prevent it. I follow all the instructions keep it seal tight,but no use. Everyday before I go to bed, I'll inflate it for about 10 mins and doesn't seems to improve much and of course, it keeps leaking all the time.I am going to return this."
1,Customs problems,"I was very disappointed to discover that I was forced to pay ca. 6 Euros in Customs charges on the spot when my book was delivered. I have been ordering books from the USA to Germany for 6 years now and this is the first time a company has completed the customs declaration in such as way that I have had to pay extra charges. I am very disappointed at this and was not expecting it at all.The delivery time was 4-5 weeks, which considering what I paid finally is also too long."
5,A Must Read!,"Get beyond ""this is too depressing"", and take very seriously what this book is telling us. A must read for anyone that has any reason at all to buy any baby product (swings, carriers, portable cribs...). Especially parents and grandparents ready to go on a shopping spree for an expected baby. Great guidelines for parents and well written. Spread the word!!"
4,good little backpack,"This backpack is just right for a toddler (around 18mo and up). It's great for bringing toys to grandma's house, going on a hike or pretending to go to school, etc. It's not really big enough to serve as a day-to-day bag for daycare (ie: you can't get an extra outfit, 5 diapers, wipes and everything into it). But it's wonderful for little trips and playing. Best of all it's not gender specific and isn't plastered with trademark characters!"
2,Burton disappointing,"I had heard that Richard Burton offered the definitive Hamlet in this production. I was, however, disappointed.I found Burton to be far too intense in the opening scenes. Here, Hamlet is supposed to be melancholic, but Burton shouts the words ""seems, madam? Nay, it is"" almost angrily, despite the dialogue's obvious suggestion of Hamlet's brooding mood. Perhaps this angry and overly intense interpretation is rooted in the intensity of the 60s, but overall, I found it to be flawed and ignorant of Hamlet's character. The rest of Burton's performance is equally abrasive.Furthermore, I found the performances of the rest of the cast to be generally uninspired and unengaging.There are, however, some exceptional elements to the production. Gielgud's stage direction and his treatment of the ghost come to mind, but, despite this, I cannot recommend this production because of Burton's performance."
2,A boring rendition,I was terribly disappointed with this. I just can't sit through the entire piece!!
4,"excellent contents, poor quality","This Bible contains some very useful study aids. The study notes are based on paragraphs/sections, rather than individual verses. For each paragraph/section, two types of commentaries are provided: ""There and Then"" provides background information; ""Here and Now"" helps readers apply the messages of the paragraph/section to our daily life. Most notes are adapted from the corresponding commentaries in NIV Application Commentaries series.Other features such as full page articles, study guides, reading tracks, book introduction, and index/concordance are all very useful.The printing quality of this Bible is rather poor, the words bleed through nearly the entire Bible, especially in the gospels where the words of Christ are in red.I use this study bible together with my NET Bible (1st edition, available form bible.org), which provides more detailed information on individual words and verses."
2,Faith In Action Study Bible,"I'm very picky about Scripture and how it is presented and this Bible seemed to dishonor God by not capitalizing the word Him. The whole Bible was in lowercase ""him"" which I thought was very disrespectful and I will therefore not continue to read it."
1,"Chomsky in a nutshell -- i.e., where he belongs","1) Open book; 2) the U.S. is the root cause of all bad things in the world; 3) repeat #2 until it's permanently imprinted on your brain; 4) close book. There, I've just saved you $11."
4,simple & great sound plus added features,"this system offer simplicity and powerful surround system. I notice if you setup the speaker in equatrial triangle from your listening position, you may enjoy the benefit of 5.1 virtual surround. The drawback is limited spot compare to regular 5.1 system. Best when you play with DVD since it has multi-channel sound. I should lower the subwoofer level below normal for dvd movies. CD only produce stereo sound and the subwoofer level need to be adjusted to higher level."
1,Unplug protect,"Many Sony home theater systems appear to have problems managing the power circuits controlling the woofer. The result is that they lock down into protect mode with the display saying ""Unplug Protect""And this with the volume set at 18....My experience with this will not allow me to buy a Sony DVD/audio system again"
2,vending start up kit,"This was way over priced for the information provided. The information is good for somebody who knows absolutely nothing about vending, but bill way's vending success secrets contained the same information (plus a lot more) at a quarter of the price"
2,beautiful barbara....,"summer sans souci... prolonged diatribe on flirting with disaster and how bikinis drove young men wild and the women who wore them seek revenge for any ills perceived real or imagined... a day or two in the super boring lives of 4 teens with no parental interaction or supervision... least they did not litter or plan anarchy! big fan of Richard Thomas and was delighted to see his first foray into sexual undertones as he is most remembered as one uptight righteous dude! Rhoda most likely had the best memories of the group for that summer, she finally fit in....sigh"
3,liked it a lot,"To be honest, when I got this book at a bargainsale I didn't have high hopes. But I was proven wrong. Mars-Jones writes with a great, wry sense of humour and offers funny insights. Yes, it IS about a sick man, but it doesn't feel like that at all, it is as if the suffering is almost like an afterthought. A very original story."
3,Not your ultimate OFDM book,"If you are looking for a book that clearly explains the mysteries of OFDM and COFDM then, you will have to wait. This is not that book. Much is left to ""as an exercise for the student."" There is some generic stuff on coding but how it relates to multipath mitigation is not clear. There are no good pictures of spectrums. The effect of amplifier non-linearities is inadequately addressed. The concept of IFFT as applied to modulation is not explained in a way you can understand it quickly. The section on coherent and differential detection is uneven in the amount of detail and understandability. The whole book has in places either too much math or not enough. There is no section on performance that tells you what the end to performance might be. Good try but far from perfect.Charan Langton"
2,GO WITH MR. COFFEE,"After 3 years, my Brewstation bit the dust today. I had tolerated it that long only because I could not justify purchasing a new coffee pot if I already had one that worked.Originally, I took my Mr. Coffee to work and purchased the Brewstation for home. I brew one pot a day at home and another pot per day at work.My complaints with the Brewstation include: 1) It does not keep coffee even close to warm for 2 hours; 2) You can not turn the warmer back on after it shuts off to keep the coffee warm for longer than two hours; 3) As long as you use a regular size coffee mug you are fine, but if you use a large travel mug or want to use a thermos, then you have to use a smaller mug to fill at the Brewstation and then pour into the larger mug or thermos; 4) My Mr. Coffee is almost 15 years old and still going strong at work, but this Brewstation only lasted 3 years. Accordingly, I am going to purchase a new Mr. Coffee tonight to use at home."
5,"The second one worked for years, I hope the next one does too.","I loved the concept and the first one I bought had an issue with leaking onto the counter top. The second one has worked for 3 years error free! I love it and I drink a lot of coffee, I have many people coming to the house that drink coffee out their noses! Everyone raves about the push the cup in and get a hot cup of joe! I just bought my third one from Amazon.com due to the inability to get this model from Target! I hope I have as much luck as I did with the second one!Thank you Hamilton Beach!"
1,Don't buy for longevity.,"Have had the machine for just over a year and the front plastic pannel is leaking. We have also had to keep a towel under for the entire time because coffee often leaked while pouring. And, not to beat a dead horse, but condensation forms on the top and drops onto the back of the machine where our cord is when the lid is lifted."
1,Total Dissappointment,"My mother has problems holding things with weight. I saw this coffee pot and thought, HOW PERFECT! WRONG!!!I got it Dec. 2003 the heating element went out of it and the clock wouldn't stay set by the time June 2004 arrived. My mother was in heaven when it worked. I had some family members purchase one because they liked mom's. What a mistake! The heating elements went out on several of them also. I really do not want to chance it with another but; my mother wants one so bad, so, with my mom being my world, I will chance another for her. Hopefully this one will be the awesome one. Fingers crossed."
5,Best Cofee Maker,I already owned this coffee maker and it quit working. I looked everywhere for another one and couldn't find one. I found it on Amazon and bought it. It works just like my old one. I love it.
3,hamilton beach 47214,I got it last week. The coffee maker is huge. I like how fast it makes the coffee but I think the coffee is not too strong. :( not happy about that since I work a lot and need my coffee to keep me going. I would not recommend it. I will keep it b/c it is okay and cheap.
1,Hamilton Beach Steam Iron Pictured as a coffee maker,"This item is a Steam Iron for clothing, not a coffee maker and yet it is pictured as a coffee maker and inappropriately offered in that list of available coffee makers.Someone in a hurry and not stopping to read the description of the product who is looking for a coffee maker of this type at a low price could mistakenly order it thinking that they were getting a coffee maker., because the item is pictured as a coffee maker.Once again the item offered here is a Steam Iron...not a Coffee maker."
2,Depends on use,"If you're looking for something with a plot to masturbate to, this film is no good at all. I had to skip around to all the 'good stuff' and it was just way too complicated. This has nudity and stuff, but there's way too much of a story line if you just need something to relax your self with."
2,Eh,This was an ok movie. The characters really didn't have much chemistry to me. You could tell that this wasn't a romance about two people who wanted a relationship. The man seemed really immature.
1,Uninspired,"Sharon Isbin's playing is dry and uninspired, her string attack undulates between lackluster and abrasive (likely her interpretation of piano and forte), and her tempo variations let you forget that Bach was a baroque composer. I regret every second I listened. If you want a reference for superb classical guitar playing, listen to Norbert Kraft or AnnaMaria Cardinalli."
2,A Brilliantly accurate depiction of an astonishingly wrong (however prevalent) view,"I have a degree in Mathematics, and as such I have spent A LOT of time with mathematics professors and can tell you one thing: Klein has hit the nail on the head in exactly one respect. He has given us a portal into the minds of today's mathematics professors and intellectuals. The opinions he expresses in this book are exactly that of every professor I met in the course of my education. So why two stars? Because Klein makes absolutely no attempt to convince you that he and the hordes of Kantians are correct. He takes Plato, Kant and Hume's ideas as unchallenged absolutes. The problem is: Plato, Kant and Hume are wrong. As a result, every claim against certainty Klein puts forward is wrong. The ideas are wrong, but they are the mainstream views in Mathematics. Thus, as a history book, it is good; however, as a math/logic book, it is horrible."
3,Good...but MK Trilogy is the PS MK game to get,"Mortal Kombat 3 for PSX was and still is pretty good.The graphics in this game were very good at the time.Almost everything about this game was true to the arcade...except for the loading times of course.The PSX version of MK3 was THE version to have back in 1995.But,now I would say,that if you want the TRUE arcade version,just pick up Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for PS2 which includes the arcade MK3 game on there.If you don't own a PS2,and just an old PSX,get Mortal Kombat Trilogy,which is a whole lot better than 3.By the way,MK Trilogy will work in the PS2.Only get this version of MK3 if you want it for your video game(and or) MK collection."
2,Almost out of date & powdered sugar was melted,"Purchased an entire case of 12 boxes and signed up for 6 month renewal on item. I didn't foresee a problem going through 12 boxes in 6 months. However, when they arrived the use by date is only 3 months out and the cookies must have been overheated, because the white powdered sugar is non-existent (cookies have a brown glazed looked). The cookies do not taste bad, and I'm hoping they are not. This item is not eligible for return, so I will just have to use these up within the next couple of months and cancel the subscription."
5,Gooooo Ligerr!,The liger 0 an ultimate X. a nice zoid. i don't see what everybody has against this thing. i mean did he Strike laser claw you upside your head. if you have all the components like me you'd think twice about what you said.
5,Super Liger Zero,Liger is the best by far.Even without the special armor.It's hours of fun.Don't worry about droping it's incrediblydurable.It is expensive.
5,ZEROS TIGHT,"Cmon you gotta have Zero if you like zoids.They dont make the transformation parts in America but you can usually find them on ebay under ""zoids"" along with alot of other cool stuff.Such as BERSERK FUHRER (we know it as BERSERK FURY)etc.Get this zoid!!!Oh and never forget that ARTEMIS FOWL ROCKS!"
5,Liger zero the best zoid ever,"Ligers the best!! I just got him a few days ago and he is awsome!! It took me 45 minutes to an hour to build, since this was my first zoid I messed up a few pieces so i had to go back and fix them. Overall I give it an A well see ya... OH I ALMOST FORGOT!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CHANGEABLE ARMORS TO COME OUT!!!."
2,"well it was ""fun"" while it lasted.........","well this toy was a christmas present for me, but after a week of having ""fun"" the batterys was completly dieing the missles were really worthless, the tail kept falling off and over all u had to change the batterys every week!!!!!!THIS TOY IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!Dont buy it trust me."
2,yuck,We bought several of the zoid toys. We were very disappointed in the quality. This toy tipped over on a table and the plastic broke in half. It was ruined. Very Disappointing. Buy Legos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The Best Zoid,"This is the best zoid I have bought ever.It walks better than some other zoids,and walks farther.Plus I think later you mite be able to buy extra amor for it from hasbro.........."
2,Discouraged,"I bought my brother this very Zoid, Gun Sniper, and brought it home. We put the tail together and laughed and wondered what we would d when we got it done.Five minutes later, I'd given up on the thing and my little brother was crying. The manual is not descriptive at all, it just has all the parts with arrows showing what snaps on to what.If you have no patience, don't even think about ordering this toy."
3,AHHHHHHH!!!!!!! ATTACK OF THE KINDA DURABLE GUN SNIPER!!!!!!,"Listen ya guys I've gotten the Gun Sniper,but IT'S NOT VERY DURABLE. Im 10 and I'm 3 monkeys' uncle! They make my room my room look like a tornado hit. Some pieces are gone now. For all I know it could be in a....SEWER!!! Get it? Well I hope that if you get a Gun Sniper put in a container. You'd have to have to have that experience to know this. Oh and by the way I got a kid named Drew to paint it red,and it looks like Naomi's off of Classic Zoids."
2,The gunly Zoid,"This zoid is great, but it has some downs like the tabs on the feet(which I ripped off),the easily breakable feather-things on its head, and that all it does is walk. I'm not saying not to buy it because It looks really cool and it has 5 guns and 2 missile launchers."
5,Beginner's Luck,"I was just walking around in [a local store] when I stumbled upon this Zoid kit. I read the box, and was fascinated. I purchased it soon after. I watch the show Zoids on Cartoon Network, and I didn't have a clue about Zoid kits(I don't get out much). Well, I'm glad I purchased the gun sniper because it was easy to put together and fun to play with, a great one for beginners like me. So if you are just starting to build Zoids, then this is the one for you. Over and Out."
4,gun sniper nightmare,"30 minutes max to put together.doesn't walk to save its life untill you cut the stupid flat plastic things on its feet, THEN it will walk for a while. when the wind up is all done, it tips over. wind up key, easy to loose, it gets put on its back between the missle pod/boosters and slightly hard to get out unless you got super tiny fingers or use something to pry it outta there.its ears, I recomend gluing those in, if you wanted to make it do the cool thing like you see Lena do on the show with the ears flipped up and forward, forget about it, to much plastic trimming to make that happen.somewhat disapointing but once you glue the ear things in, nothing seems to damage it.simple..has movable fingers, guns on hands, jaw movement, tail gun movement, the tail moves, the boosters move and you can flip the missle pods open."
4,A Starbucks addict loves this machine,"I got tired of spending $$ at coffee houses and waiting in line so decided to make my own. Looked at several brands and prices. But decided I wanted something decent with little $. Easy to use and clean, made a great latte the first time! Frothing is great. Taste quality is NOT disappointing, I love this machine! NOTE: doesn't come with any cups or milk pitcher. Bought a stainless steel pitcher and 3oz. measured shot glass at Target (7.99/1.99) that work perfectly. Enjoy this machine :-)"
4,FULL OF GOOD LAUGHS,"The jokes are fast, furious, and really funny. The price of the book is worth it just for one particular comic strip... it's been years since I first read it, but I still get a hearty laugh every time I read the ""St. Francis"" gag."
5,Perhaps THE best Heyer,The Grand Sophy is one of my all-time favourite Georgette Heyers. A must-read! Sophy's audacity and interactions with the hero are great.
2,An ugly run of antisemiticism ruins this lark.,"Much as it grieves me, I can't recommend this book for the insulting description of the Jewish moneylenders which is the big ugly elephant in the room. It is simply a racist chapter in an otherwise delightful book."
3,It's ok.,"This is my fifth Georgette Heyer book and I wouldn't recommend it. I thought Sophy ridiculous and meddlesome and the whole plot sort of predictable. I had high hopes, but this one was just dumb. People have mentioned the anti-semitism in the book. I didn't think much of it at first, but now that i think about it, I don't like it and it was so unnecessary. Plus the author makes a reference to Spaniards being lazy or something like that when describing one of the characters. I was surprised the author would describe a whole population as lazy. I've read Frederica, Cousin Kate, and Friday's Child. I attempted to read her book on William the Conqueror, but i got lost in all the detail. too boring. I'd recommend all of those over this one."
2,the absolute worst Georgette Heyer book,"I LOVE Georgette Heyer and I heard this was many people's favorite. After I read it, I can say, ""Not mine!"" The main character is SO annoying that I winced through most of the book. The whole anti-semitic scene is just terrible and ridiculous even from a merely literary perspective. If you want a good Heyer read, pick up _Cotillion_ or just about anything else."
3,my first Heyer!,"While a bit purple and overwrought, I did enjoy this one... although I'm pretty sure Sophy would have been shunned from proper society in about two seconds if this had happened in Regency England.I am craving more ridiculously flowery prose now..."
3,The humor overwhelms the characters,"This is a very funny book, but the constant screwball comedy overwhelms the characters, who come off as one-dimensional as a result. There is also a scene which is clearly anti-Semitic, which makes this reader squirm. Sophy may only be twenty years old, but she seems to have omniscient wisdom for her age, carries everyone and every situation before her like a tidal wave, and Always Knows Best. There are some wonderful scenes - particularly the round-up at the end, when all the major characters appear, in a plausible way, and all plot threads are resolved. I'm conflicted by this book. As a lifelong fan of Heyer's work, I appreciate the humor and readability. But the scene with the money-lender casts a shadow on it and I'm annoyed by Sophy's perfection and infallibility."
3,Nice story,"Enjoyed the book - good read if you like period pieces. Being English myself I found that some of the language used was not quite ""historical"" (modern terminology thrown in once in a while)"
4,my first zoid,i just got a warshark from [retail store] and it is coolbut every time i take my warshark out of the water it tail fallsoff...
4,"A fun, cute movie.","I loved this movie. Not that it was the greatest thing out there, but because it is sweet and endearing. You don't find very many movies anymore that make you laugh and feel at the same time. With all the gross body humor out there, this one is a keeper...."
4,A Romance Novel Turned Movie,"In the spirit of Romancing the Stone, this movie (Originally ""Don't Tell Her It's Me"") feels like a very cute romance novel turned into movie format. Shelley Long is her regular likeable but vaguely annoying self as the romance writer & match-making sister to Steve Guttenberg, who turned out one of his most enjoyable performances. He's an idiot but a cute idiot, though I might've wished for someone a little sexier as a compliment to the oh-so-beautiful Jami Gertz. Very fun & light-hearted romantic comedy."
4,Don't tell her it's me. VHS,"I love the movie and although I was sent the VHS instead of the DVD it is still great. It is romantic and very fun and very much a chick flick, the cast is well done. Steve Guttenburg is always fun to watch."
5,Very exciting,"I saw this movie for the first time on Comcast Demand back in 2009 and I loved it. I'm so glad I have it, so now I can see it all the time. I like the adventure of the transformation that Steve Guttenberg goes through, like an ugly duckling to a handsome swan."
4,sometimes you need a good trio,"Cyrus Chestnut is a wonderful young talent and this cd showcases him terrifically. I strongly disagree with a previous reviewer that this is even close to easy listening. First, Cyrus plays extremely aggressively. Without ever losing his touch he bangs the heck out of the keyboard on some selections. This is, after all a trio (which is joined by a saxophonist on three songs that all work). The trio is a classic jazz lineup and sometimes, it is exactly what you want to hear. This cd rewards on the first listening and is still pleasing me!"
4,very good gun,this gun is very good so far i have han no problems exept for the aiming it is very difficult to aim.
4,decent buy,"The first thing i noticed when i got this gun out of the packaging is definitely the weight of the gun. It is definitely heavy for a spring gun, and in no way does this detract from the overall rating of this product. Ive been using it for a few weeks now and it's pretty good. It's a little inaccurate for a spring gun, and the red dot sight was a pain to get onto the gun correctly. However, overall this is a pretty good buy for your money. I'd definitely reccomend it to anyone looking for a cheap airsoft gun that will provide decent performance."
1,Perfume,I tried this perfume and sprayed just a small amount on my self. It took my breath away and made me nauseated.
1,"No longer ""guiltless"" -- these chips now have added fat","When this product first came out, it had no added oil and was actually healthful. But on the more recent packaging, you can see that it says, ""New, bolder taste!"" And what kind of chip do they consider to have a ""bolder"" taste? One that's more oily. The chips now have oil added (look at the ingredient list!), and it only takes 18 small chips to give you 3 grams of dietary fat. I've signaled my dissatisfaction with this (I now consider the labeling to be deceptive, because the chips are as fatty as many fried snacks) by no longer buying the product."
1,Cardboard Chips,"These taste like cardboard. Hard, bland and the black bean have an off bitter taste. I've had a lot of baked, diet chips and these are the worst!"
3,awsome chips but mishandling crumbled them all,"I love these chips they are the best and healthiest blue chips on the market. The bags and the box they came in, however, were beat up and smashed to the point that there were no whole chips left and many were just crumbles."
3,Good but crumbly,"The chips were as good as any other Blue Corn chips I've tasted, but the shipping process apparently left them in crumbles. I don't think there were any whole chips in any of the bags."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm sorry, but this book was a laugher when it was written, and it's a laugher now. Improbable premise, shallow detail and predictable finish. It's even funnier now in the light of history, and a good reason why fictional characters should be.. FICTIONAL. Archer has no concept of American politics."
3,Not a good sequel,When I bought this book I expected to read the advantages or disadvantages of a female president as well as the sequel of the previous JA's novel. I read neither of them so I was disappointed at the book's end. Is a good book. A good plot. But not what I expected.
3,Shall We Tell the President,This book had a good story but I was disappointed that it really was not about the President. It was only about the plot to kill her.
5,Keeps your hair healthy,"When I first bought this hair dryer, I was a bit concerned about the size and the weight. However, I easily got over the weight. A little exercise won't hurt? I'm very pleased with the quietness of the dryer. It does make a noise but it's not like other dryers that sounds like they are about to blow your head off. What I'm most pleased with is the softness and the shinniness that it leaves!! It makes my hair so soft and easy to manage afterwards. And the drying time is above-average. Also, make sure you're not storage conscious, b/c it does take a space in the cabinet. Got mine from target for $34.99."
4,"Cool hairdryer, good for thick hair & great for the price!","I really like this hair dryer. I have pretty thick hair and it cut the drying time in half, especially when straightening it. I love that it includes the difuser and concentrater. It's sleek and very easy to use. However I keep hitting the ""cool shot"" when I don't mean to while drying my hair, but not a big deal. Overall a good purchase."
3,Remington D-2012 Tstudio Ceramic Hair Dryer,"I am disappointed in this hair dryer. It has lots of power, but is way too heavy. The on/off and heat setting buttons are in the wrong place. I keep accidentally turning it off or changing the heat setting when I'm using it. I like my previous hair dryer MUCH better!"
2,lasted 6 months,I gave this to my sister as a birthday gift along with the hair straighter this worked great for her until it just stoped working out of nowhere we tried everything from the reset but to calling costumer service nothing helped horrible product
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,"I would say this toy is NOT worth the money! My 17 Month old son is a VERY active baby so I thought this toy would entertain him for a while well I was wrong. He went crazy over it for the first 5 days. Now a month later he barely rides it I have to say I am very disapointed! The good thing about this toy is I do not have to have the tracks down so he could ride it, it will go in circles by it self. The battery compartment is unsafe he always opens it there are to many wires where he can hurt him self. There is a seatbelt but he will not let me put it on. There is a button for the music which is easy for olders infants/toddlers to press. My son gets board easy and you can only go in co many circles before it gets boring. I would NOT recommend buying this toy."
3,it is just ok so far...,"I was very exicited to get this to my daughter before she gets too old for it(she is 22 months), I also thought of this one because I have a baby who is 5 months now and soon (4 more months) will be able to ride it.My daughter liked it, I thought she would ride it a bit more, but was on it no more than 10 mins and it is the first time for her. Usually a brand new toy gets a lots of use at least the first time if they like it.She learned very quikly how to turn it on and off, the motor is a bit loud, the traks are quite loose, and the wheels don't turn all at the same time.A good thing I guess, is that even though, it only goes in circles because the tires are fix that way, you can just use the car with out the tracks and it will ride the same, unless you have heavy carpet.[...][...]we will see, hopefully it will be a toy that will captivate my kids for the long term."
5,Great Historian,"I have read many histories but few writers compare to Mr. Irving. He is a historian actually interested in history, in finding out what really happened - not what government propoganda states or what run-of-the-mill historians have written in the past but actual facts. He does great research and, unlike many historians, is not afraid to go against ideas of the herd. And he writes well. All his works are fine, but his ""Hitler's War"" and ""Churchill's War"" are such excellent books that I highly recommend them to everyone but especially to anyone interested in the politics and personalities of WWII."
1,Not worth the money,"I don't even know where to begin. Eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids. (1 1/2 and 6 months old) Instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him, she would cover her face and cry! He would go off all by himself, which was really creepy in the middle of the night. And he broke after a couple of months. Now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house. He's defantly not worth the money"
4,The beginner's Guide to Intercession,"While I would have wished for more specifics on how to interceed, I found the book to be a great motivator. Mr. Sheet's chapter on praying for the unsaved was very specific and useful."
5,Shabby Chic Queen,My wife absolutely loves all of Rachel Ashwell's things. Thanks sooo much. Terry and Darlene
1,Don't waste your Money,This is one of the Worst games ever. I would give it away for free. I am not kidding guys it is really really bad. The picture is distorted on newer tv's. The Characters/actors are just plain cheesy. I would strongly recommend not one buy this. Not wanting to waste my money I tried to give it ago it was almost painful and I ended up just turning off the tv and walking away. $20 down the drain :(
4,All things Arnold,The couple delves into the impact of Arnold on society. Much of it deals with the Terminator and businesses refering to themselves as 'The Terminator' of their business type or some aliteration that pertains to that.One of them even has a dream about Arnold. All of this occured before his fall from grace due to the child born out of wedlock.
4,A man we'd better watch/a book we should read!,"Everybody knows Arnold Schwarzenegger is ""larger than life"" but Michael Blitz and Louise Krasniewicz have suggested, in their book, that Arnold is a giant for reasons we may not be fully aware of. Not only has he become a metaphor for just about everything Americans are into, he is a major political force whose ""power"" seems to come from a frighteningly effective image-machine. Who IS this guy? He's the guy you think of when you are trying to express how big or strong or powerful or celebrated someone is. These authors have written a fascinating book not so much about Arnold as about all of us and our hunger for some kind of hero. I loved the book. Why only 4 stars? Because the only 5-star book I've ever read is Great Expectations by Charles Dickens! Otherwise, I recommend this book, especially if you would like to read something that is definitely NOT ordinary!"
1,Disapointment,"I am about halfway through the book. It is strange and it makes me think the authors need to spend some time on the couch. They are obsessed with Arnold and try to tell the reader why the reader is too, whether he/she is or not!I don't think too many people need to read a book about not how, or why, but THAT Arnold is popular!"
4,the aging cheerleader,"It is more usual to come accross more balanced books - that is, books that treat aging a problem or issue. It is refreshing to come accross an unabashed song of joy and encouragement. The other books have their function as well - we are growing in pain, growing in frailty, growing in limitations that nature puts upon us. Not everyone can be like Moses, who was hearty and strong until his death at 120. But this book at least sets a hopeful tone, and is helpful in its positive focus."
4,Content: yay - packaging: nay,"I've owned the vinyl LP of this fantastic album since it's 1972 release. Great to finally have it on CD - and with ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" as a bonus track, no less! Great sound quality, and some interesting alternate photographs from the cover shoot.My only complaint (and the reason I subtract one star) is the horrendous packaging. It's a digipack {shudders}. Record companies PLEASE...jewel boxes or Japanese-style mini-LP packaging are wonderful, but lose these Godawful digipacks!"
3,Not the best of Putumayo,"I like the Putumayo CDs in general, but this is not one of their best. My child LOVEs music but is totally uninterested in the songs. They are mostly slower songs and generally all have the same/similar sound or beat."
3,I do not recommend taking this product!!,"Unless otherwise prescribed by a doctor, I would not take this medication. I have since got off all unneeded medicines and have been feeling better ever since. You don't know what kind of ingredients are being put into these drugs."
3,"Downstairs, Upstairs","Max makes his move in this installment of the series...but will it lead anywhere? Vanessa continues on her quest, but is unsuccessful...Lavinia parades her wedding dress & extraordinary veil, to Liz's dismay, and everyone awakes the next day to find the veil slashed and ruined! Elizabeth is accused, but will someone save her before she is deported? The superficial sister Sarah has her sights set on another dog, classmate William. The book moves slower than previous books."
4,Need More History,"Something was missing for me in the historical recount.She meets her 90 year old mother in a nursing home and starts asking very leading questions that suggest she should feel pity (whether she should or shouldn't isn't the point) when I was just waiting for her to head in the direction of how her mother came to believe in the nazi lifestyle in the first place. The previous reviewer is right, they pick right up where she leaves her children and joins the SS party and is viewed as a monster but I think it's responsible to attempt to understand humanity's motives and find out what the catalyst was to her drastic life change. There are even hints that she missed her old life terribly but these reasons are not explored, only pondered over by the writer in hindsight. As the famous saying goes, if you neglect to understand these situations, however painful they may be, history may repeat itself.Overall, it was a very good read but the detail above it why I'm giving it 4 stars."
3,Interesting,I enjoyed the book but kept wondering why the mother's name or the camp she worked at ever mentioned. Would have made the book more enjoyable.
1,Lousy Graphire 4 pen,"I am a long-term daily user of the Graphire 4 tablet. While I like using the tablet, the pen often rolls away and falls off my desk. The ferrite bars inside are easily damaged from dropping. This is my 3rd pen in 3 years. I suggest using a Graphire 2 pen instead."
3,GRAPHIRE4 Blue Pen,Graphire4 Blue Pen Do you actually need the tablet to use this pen or will work on any surface?
4,Bad Religion has still got it.,I love this album. It may have a semi-pop sound but I dont mind because Lyricaly nothing else in newer punk comes close to being this profound. It is also just great to see a band that is still recording after all theese years and is still as politicaly relivant as they have ever been. Good punk music isnt just about being loud and fast because if you sound hardcore but have nothing to say you might as well join a metal band and sing about nothing.
1,BR should have quit years ago,"Bad Religion hasn't released a good new record since No Control. Anything afterward is crap and should be ignored. It is sad to see a band I was once a fan of descend to such embarrassing lows. Avoid this at all costs. Reading all of these good reviews leads me to believe that most of these people wouldn't know a good punk record if it came up and kicked them in face. Here's a hint, this ain't a good one.If you're just now thinking about trying BR, get ""How Could Hell Be Any Worse,"" ""Suffer,"" and ""No Control."" ""Suffer"" is the best. Forget the rest of their boring junk."
2,Not so good....,"Well.... the album feels like a rush job. it's too political and the songs don't really do a lot to me. Every one is boring and shallow, EXCEPT ""Beyond electric Dreams"", if BR had cranked up more songs like this, it could have been something. Oh well, it has been 10 years since their last great album STRANGER THAN FICTION. Everything after that just isn't that good with the possible exception of The process of Belief. Wich was ok, and restored my faith in BR a little. But this one ruined that again."
1,Do not buy for MacBook Pro,"I bought this from the Apple store in May '09 for my early 2009 15"" MacBook Pro running OS X 10.5.7. Neither the driver that came with it nor the one from Griffin's support site was recognized after installation. Plugging the card into the express port crashed the computer. Griffin tech support said not to spend time on it because people were experiencing lots of problems on Macs and I was not likely to get this model to work with my computer. The guy told me to return it for a refund. (I have to say that their tech support was available immediately and the tech actually knowledgeable.)Have also heard that none of these cards will transfer Mac ""sparseBundle"" files, which Time Machine creates. That's mainly the reason I wanted the card, to backup my backups on a large, inexpensive eSATA disk."
3,ok toy,My 5 yr old grandson enjoyed playing with the toy. The toy is very durable and should last a long time.
1,shattered glass,Within a week of wearing this watch the crystal developed a small crack. Within a few hours the entire crystal was caracked rendering the watch useless. Knowing that Skagen would say the damage was caused by impact damage I'm not going to send it in for repair. I beleive the watch was defective out of the box.
2,Good for the first 25 pages,I bought this becuse it got a great review in the Village Voice and now seeing that the author lives in Brooklyn he must know the reviewer and got a gift from him. Anyway I read close to a hundred pages hoping it would get better and reaized that it was a complete waste of my time.
4,Nice Surprise,"Small, taut, darkly comic gem of a novel that received no publicity. Balances bleak social satire with deeply empathatic characters, which most comic novels cannot do. Funny and smart about human relationships. Oddly enough, I also love a small, non-hyped, funny nonfiction book about fatherhood, ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler. Funny and compassionate and insightful, also, but delightful rather than dark."
1,it was a very bad book of snowboarding,This book is very bad and does not give a real idea of the sport of snowboarding
5,great replacement tips,"if you're like me you lost your no mar tip a long time ago and never replaced it leaving a trail of dents that needed to be filled in any critical paint grade trim work you may have been doing. looser move for sure, but this 3 pack solved that problem fast and cheap so buy some , stock up and don't loose them"
4,watch band pin remover,this tool sure beats trying to push watch band pins out with a pin or paperclip. use it once and you will be sold!
4,Pin Removal Tool,"Worked great for me. I had no problem using it with my watchband which is 7/8 inches wide. It is plastic and you need to take your time. You need to make sure the pin is alighed with the hole in the band, but once this is done, it worked without any problems."
5,Cheap and it works,What else do you need to know? I used it on a Citizen Eco-drive stainless steel band and it worked great.
1,Watch Band Pin Remover,"Totally useless for watch band pin removal, the pins provided keep breaking. I would not recommend buying it."
5,What a great intro to an awesome series,"This book contains two stories from the awesome Hunters series by Shiloh Walker. It begins with Declan, a werewolf and Tori, a human who turns into more than your average vampire. Both characters complement each other and Ms. Walker lays the groundwork about paranormal shifters who protect the innocent and punish the bad guys.The second story involves a Master Vampire named Eli and witch named Sarel. Each story continues to build and their world continues to expand with rich characters and multiple layers. It is so difficult to explain all and everything about their world without giving away the entire story. The sexual energy is very intense and graphic. This is not your average romance novel. However, each couple are clearly destined for each other provided they can overcome a ""few"" obstacles.The ebooks are great but the print cover for this one is awesome. A definite keeper. Once you start reading this series, you will be hooked."
1,Dissapointing,"This book was a bit dissapointing, really. You think a book of this size and price would at least include more and better information, and many of my desired majors it had absolutely no information on. Totally was not worth it."
1,wrong image,I recently ordered this sign and the image does not look like An English Mastiff. It does however look like a Bullmastiff. I was very disappointed as I raise English Mastiffs and wanted to put this on my deck for my clients to see.
4,the best of fighting game since street fighter,"this is old school for those who loves king of fighters,samurai showdown,art of fighting and fatal fury saga. One of the best fighting games ever."
5,Entertaining!,"This book is very entertaining and an easy read. It made me laugh several times, but also taught me a lot about the American society, even though maybe not all of it should be taken too seriously. I would recommend this book to anyone planning a trip to the U.S. It will not only give you a good time reading it before going, but also give you some useful hints on how to interact with the people of the country"
5,Mine wont display the Artist.... please help...,anyone else have this problem? please help... i am using Windows Media Player...
1,Isolde review,"I have never before had the displeasure to read a work by an author who uses free association adjectives which are disconcerted and unrelated to the noun: i.e. absurdly inappropriate. The book is flat and uninteresting, a poor excuse for a novel about legendary characters. The story deviates from Morte De Arthur considerably and does not meet the reality test of, Is this story believable? Its not. On describing the battle to the death with Marhaus, the author confides Tristan is sexually aroused by the thought of battle to the death. How believable is that?"
2,Not for the Intellectual,"This is a good book for fantasy or romance readers. Have you ever seen The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston? This novel has lots of interactions reminiscent of that movie...muscular, sweaty single dimensional men grabbing women by the shoulders and booming dialogue into their faces....beautiful, single-dimensional women melting in their arms... If you enjoy historical fiction and are looking for a more authentic historical novel, try reading Sharon Kay Penman."
1,Karups Espresso Lid,"Everyone is correct on this. The lid is just crap. After reading the reviews on this and making a cup of cappuccino on my type 963,I decided to look in my junk drawer for answers. I pulled out a rubber band that came from some broccoli or some such thing and put it around the lid where the tabs are. I poured and the lid did not fall off. There, I fixed it. :-)"
3,A fun Oracle for beginners!,"The Enchanted Astrologer is a fun way of learning the Zodiac, the different astological houses, the ruling planets, etc. The artwork is very pretty and the readings are pretty accurate (but very general compared to the Tarot or another Oracle)!I bought this set (Cards come with a How-to-Use book) on sale....after opening and using them, I wouldn't ever pay full price! Recommended for the beginning Astrologer and/or Diviner. Advanced Practioners will find this deck too bland and general for professional or regular usage."
4,"CRAZY, BEAUTIFUL","Crazy indeed is cult director Alex de la Iglesia's 2010 Venice Film Festival winner about two clowns - one sad and one happy - who enter into a bizarre and memorable love triangle. Set during the brutal Spanish Civil War as well as the end of Franco's regime, the demented parable is like an amalgam of Fellini, Del Toro, Hitchcock with a pinch of Burton and more than a twist of German Expressionism. Often nightmarishly absurd, shocking and irreverent, the visually rich cinematic tapestry defies a singular interpretation and like all great -- or even good -- art, sticks in the mind long after it is experienced."
2,Assylum,"Slow, predictable, boring. With that cast there should have been more feeling for the characters. I did not like it nor would I recommend it."
4,Worked well,When I bought this unit just over a year ago it was under $14.00. It was made in USA and it worked fine so a great deal. No finish on the cast so rusts over fast.
1,DLINK IS JUNK!,"If your looking for a device to bridge with, as I once did in this device, head on over to Belkin's F5D7330 Wireless Ethernet Adapter and read my review. Belkin's equipment is so much more reliable, it does what you ask it to and doesn't flinch like inferior DLINK and LINKSYS products.This DLINK device claims to perform 5 different purposes and can't get 1 straight, it's straight GARBAGE!"
1,"Can""t set up properly.",Be wary of refurbished products not coming from the manufacturer or official distributor. Not always easy for a non-technical person to work with. If sold directly by D-Link probably would have been a better outcome.
5,Great Book!!,"Della Reese's voice has always inspired me. Her new book is filled with funny (and not so funny) stories about her life, told with her own special touch. I can't put it down! She talks about the problems had when she was growing up in a realistic way, rather than blaming anyone for the way it was back then. Thank goodness, times have changed!! She says in the beginning that this book will change the way you see things. It has done that for me and helped me see a different way of viewing people and situations. Her story is an inspiration for everyone -- regardless of color or belief. My favorite quote from the book: ""If you can dream it, you can do it!"""
3,Very Nice As Expected,"This was a Lovely Purchase, Prompt Service Quick Delivery! I Am Most Satisfied, even though the Previous Effort was Rejected, though since I was trying to be funny, admittedly It failed miserably, I'll stick to the Clubs, for my Laughs? hmnn Anyway Thank you Very Much!Very Satisfied Good Service Thanks Again!Cheers Tim Groves TRX 15"
3,adequate product,"I previously owned an Ultra Shark and thought that Scunci was equal. It has proved to be only an adequate product. The Scunci does not have the same power as my Shark,nor the quality. The handle on my Scunci keeps falling off and it is very difficult to pull out the dustbin to empty. The cheaper price is proving to just not be a good value."
5,Awesome!!!,"You need this single!!! This is one of the best singles to come around in a long time. If you haven't heard it you need to. Best versions are of course the ""Interupted Vocal Mix""(which isn't actually the origianl mix) and the Stanton Warrior's which doesn't stray too far from the interupted vocal & just adds a little break beat, all mix's are phookin' great though. This track will go well in just about any set so long as it's done right. Don't even think about it, just buy the CD!!!"
3,Beautiful Voice,"Although I love Katharine's voice, her first album feels too influenced by American Idol. Her second album is absolutely great. Love her beautiful voice, but the songs she sings leave a lot to be appreciated."
3,3.5 stars overall; 5 for what we could hear of Kat's gorgeous voice!,"We were disappointed. Such beauty and talent! But her nimrod producers thought it a good idea to make her sound like other pop/r&b singers that we're already bored with! We already have a Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Beyonce, etc. and boring etc.! We wanted to hear Katharine McPhee, not a drum machine, not the same old loud back ground singers! Katherine, honey, dump the jerks who think they know how to sell you! SPREAD YOUR WINGS AND FLY!!!"
5,A Slice of Heaven!,"Katharine McPhee's debut album is definitely one of the best CDs I have bought in a long time. It has something for everyone..amazing ballads...something to groove to..and one stellar voice.McPhee has something truly beautiful, sensual and enticing in her vocals and knows how to connect with the songs. And the production on this album is top notch!Every song offers something that truly makes you an instant fan of McPhee's. She is most certainly a force to be reckoned with. The ballads will give you the chills (""Home"" and ""Better Off Alone""), the up-tempos will get you groovin' (""Not Ur Girl"" has a ska-pop beat, while ""Open Toes"" has a fabulous, unexpected ending) and possibly her finest moment comes on ""Neglected."" Her vocals are haunting and beautiful.Whether you have followed her since her Idol days or just came across her from her undeniable single ""Over It,"" you must give McPhee's album a chance. Every minute is a slice of heaven."
5,Awesome CD from Katharine McPhee,"This is a GREAT CD, and I listen to it almost every single day!! Quick Delivery. Thank you!!"
5,Versatility at it's best.........,"The beautiful voice of Katharine Mcphee that I fell in love with a year ago on television is not lost in this album.""Over It"" is brilliant with Kat's voice as the back-up. I like many, was skeptical with the genre. This is so much better than I expected. ""Neglected"" is chilling and ""Home"" is where you want to be with someone you are crazy about while listening to the lyrics and crisp, clear, smooth vocals of Kat. While not the standards, you will not be disappointed with this diverse and eccletic, soon to be album of the year."
3,Pleasant pop album but nothing too memorable.,"Katharines debut is hit or miss. Her stunning voice that she showcased during the show gets thrown to the curb for almost half the album. Too much production and backing vocals mask what a beautiful gift she has, and while I enjoyed most of the songs, I barely can remember how half of them go. The only songs that really stick out which have great hit potential is the amazingly catchy Not Ure Girl and the cheesy, but very very hot, Open Toes, which with a few remixes could be a dance club smash. Ballads are beautiful such as Home and Ordinary World, but as said above she never uses her voice to it's fullest potential. Most of the songs such as Love Story, Each Other, and her first single Over It did start to grow on me after a few listens so I'm hoping after a few more listens more of the songs will. Overall a pleasant pop album that is ejoyable but nothing too exciting or memorable."
3,"Katharine McPhee, work in progress","What a wonderful voice, what terrible music and lyrics to mach it to. It would be better if the package marketing was more specific about the type of songs that were on the CD. I did like the her voice, she has such a great range. I'm sure in the future as Katharine is introduced to better producers and song material, she will become one of the greats and not just another female artist."
2,Not for programming or math novices,"I found this book to be difficult to read, especially towards the middle. A major problem with this type of book is a failure to use real world examples. Novices who are not math oriented should read Gookin's books first, and try to build from there."
3,"Good, but no application power","The teaching method is very quick, about half way through the book you'll probably be able to produce some very week programs. The book overall does a good job of teaching different keywords and the use of different functions but it doesn't discuss how to apply those into your own programs. It's good to get you on your feet with programming but once your done with it it really can't help you any furthur.Don't hesitate at buying this book because its about C and you want to learn C++. You'll find that while programming C++ it will be necessary to use plain C code. So even if your interested in C++ this book will be helpfull.The code in the book will work with most compilers so you won't have to worry about code you can't work with.Overall its a good book to start your education into C."
2,Very bad book,"I bought this book a year ago and one thing I can say is it is very bad. I had done little programming before this, mostly just doing things in BASIC, and I saw this book in my local bookstore. So I bought it thinking it would help me to push on to a better system. This book might look good if you just look in the Overview, but let me tell you I have to say this is the worst book I have ever bought. You will get a basic understanding of the C programming language, but you will not be able to write anything more then printing text to the screen. If you do want to buy a book buy ""The C programming language, 2nd edition."" That book is the C bible."
2,Bad workmanship.,"Item received on time in a damaged box. The hole punch was not damaged in transit but the workmanship is very bad. Quality control is non existent. Everything is hard to adjust and it doesn't cut clean holes. The way it was packaged I got the impression it had been returned once before which is what I should have done. The only reason I didn't is because I needed the 11/32"" holes which is hard to find in a 3-hole punch."
5,Both practical and inspiring,"A superb little book that contains an immense amount of genuine practical knowledge, well written and charmingly illustrated. Some people may find the unconventional methods for hollowing the bore of the instrument a little strange, but the account of making and refining all the critical elements of the head joint is excellent. Making a good recorder takes a lot of experience but this book is a very good starting point. If I had to recommend just one book on the subject, this would be it."
3,Check the ISBN folks,"Just wanted to point out to everyone interested that the ISBN on this listing is the one already used on Volume Two (just checked my copy), not the upcoming Volume Three.(Now, it might just be a mistake of some kind and it might actually be Volume Three, but I know I don't want to take the risk since the ISBN is what these book dealers really go by.)Since Amazon is currently only offering two listings for ""Essential Tomb of Dracula"", this one and the one clearly labeled as ""Volume Four"", I don't know what this means for those of us who still need to order Volume Three.David Young"
4,Slow Beginning But Gathers Steam Nicely,"Marvel should be congratulated for putting out The Essential Tomb of Dracula Vol. 1 (and Vol. 2 and, soon, Vol. 3). It was a series from the mid-70s that I never got hooked on until later and, to be fully appreciated, it must be savoured from the beginning, particularly after Marv Wolfman takes over scripting early on. It is one long storyline with little or no superheroic elements and, therefore, never got the attention it deserved, much like as happened also to Master of Kung Fu, and now seems to get attention mainly for introducing the character of Blade (a nice character but my personal favourite is Hannibal King, who does not appear until the final issue of this volume). Gene Colan's pencils have never been put to better use than in the moody stories of Wolfman and the black and white format of the Marvels Essentials is finally not a drawback to enjoying the series. Tomb of Dracula is well served by this kind of treatment."
2,Surprise Ending,"Well I skipped reading Downstairs, Upstairs, because I knew that I wouldn't miss much, and I was right. Basically Vanessa finally takes action, but I still can't bring myself to completly like the character. Sarah is completly boring, and I also don't like this character. The Max and Liz storyline was interesting to a degree, and I was a little surprised what Liz did, although I think that the author kind of cheated the readers by doing this. I find the Liz and Max storyline unbelievable. How many women get a chance to meet an earl and fall in love with him? I hope that the SVU series comes back."
5,Excellent Product!,"These item came as shown, fantastic condition, made for a great gift!! Very happy with this purchase! Would recommend this to anyone who is a truck enthusiast/collector!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!,"this game sucks so bad. They tried to copy a good game like Settlers of Catan, but totally screwed up, making a terrible game. And then they charge 50 bucks for it! Whats up with that?"
1,Didn't work-twice,My son got this for his birthday and it didn't work. It was like the batteries kept dying even though we put new ones in. It wouldn't read the stories and would just fade away. We ended up tossing it because we already threw out the box so were unable to return it. He happened to get another one for Christmas which doesn't work either. This time it doesn't recognize the books when they are put in and skips because it will recognize it one minute and then say to insert a book the next. We won't be trying a third time.
2,Very cheap product - not durable,"I used this product for about a month and it came apart. I reassembled it, but then the fuse blew. I suppose with a little more tinkering, I could get it working, but I'm sick of fiddling with this cheap plastic toy. Buy it only if you enjoy tinkering with small plastic parts which fall apart and break if you look at them sideways."
4,Basic summary of symptoms and causes of Candida and CRC.,"Introductory text explaining the causes and symptoms of Candida Albicans, and Candida Related Complex (CRC).A must read for those experiencing the problems caused by the systemic Candida infection, and for those who want to avoidthe long and painful road to recovery."
1,The worst book ever published.,"Natural Law and Natural Rights by John Finnis is, by far, the worst book I have ever read. The author maps his arguments in an outline format, in the hope of capturing his audience. Though, this outline format is way of organizing ideas within different topics, it lacks the extensive explanation and cross-referrences a reader needs. Real-life examples are out of the question, since the author neither give them nor explain them fully. In addition, to the lack of explanations, the author speaks as if he has intelligence. It is clearly obvious that he knows nothing about keeping his audience awake. Despite the fact that this book is boring, the author also loses the audience by making simple arguments sound complex, thus, using uneccessary vocabulary. Granted, this book is not intended for neanderthals, however, anyone would agree that this book is not worth the paper its printed on."
2,"Very limited, basic information",I purchased this book thinking it would have a large amount of valuable information. Instead it glossed over very basic food storage information in the first half and than filled the last half with blank pages for you to write in your inventory and also some basic recipes. If I wanted a recipe book than I would have purchased one specific for long term food storage. This book tries to do a little of everything and ends up providing a lot of nothing.
2,"Too impractical, get a Boy Scout handbook instead","Although it contains some common-sense information on food storage, much of this book is far too impractical for the average survivalist. For example, the article on making bread in case of an emergency explains the recipe for making bread but fails to explain HOW to mix those ingredients during a power failure. Kneading bread is work intensive and few modern urban dwellers have even a basic knowledge of the process. Most of the other recipes require some type of appliance to either mix or cook which eliminates most of them during a power outage like when you're living in a tent. A better buy for your money would be the Boy Scouts Handbook."
3,My view,Was hoping for more info on getting ready for problems..book was mostly on food prep..it would of been nice to have more info on other areas
2,Food prep,"Not what I expected. If you are totally new to the idea and have no clue how to organize yourself...this is your book. If you are already in to prepping, this isn't much help. I expected more meat ( pun pun) rather than a book of workspace for me to write my plans. I also thought the ""& Survival Handbook"" would give other survival info instead of just food."
3,A good starting guide,"The book is a good starting guide but with a clearly American bias. All measurements are imperial, so you will have to do your own conversions if you want metric. The other major downfall I can see is that Layton fails to mention that storing all your emergency items in one area is like putting all your eggs in one basket. Should that area of your home be damaged by a disaster, you are left high and dry. I strongly suggest storing a range of items in different areas of your home and outside the house if possible. Good planning guides and references to websites at the back of the book. If by ''survival'' you take it to mean hard core prepping, then you will be disappointed. This book covers no methods of self defence. It does however contain some very good advice and I would recommend it as a part of a surivival library."
5,Very Good Book!,"This book is easy to read and very informative. It gives you loads of ideas to prepare for any kind of disaster. I recommend it to anyone that wants to be ready for whatever is ahead; weather, earthquake, tornado or any other disaster."
3,Nice,I've not really had a chance to get into this book yet with the holidays and all. Delivery was very quick and the item was as described on the site.
5,Mr. SyberVision--Mr. Tempo and Mr. 59,"Al Geiberger is almost as famous for being the SyberVision model as he is for shooting a 59. This book is a wonderful summary of the swing and provides keys to playing better. It is should even be better as a companion to the SyberVision video that stars Geiberger. The video sold over 1 million copies in the 1980's and became the rage of golf all over the world. I just purchased the re-release of the video on DVD from SyberVision at www.sybervision.com. Hopefully, it and the book will work for me as well as it has reportedly done for others."
4,A book as simple as a good swing,"Most of my searching for golf help is looking for ways to focus on tempo and timing. This book was very helpful in its isolation of just the few keys that Gieberger uses in his swing. His swing keys on the left arm and leg swing. Gieberger must be a man of few words. The book doesn't fill up with tips unrelated to the subject of tempo. He has a cool video too, just his swinging set to music - no words at all. His swing is old-school, a lot like Nicklaus'with the raised left heel. It's a good book!"
1,No soup for you.,I could not find a single recipe that I would use. Either they contained odd ingredients or the entire recipe did not sound edible. I absolutely do not recommend purchasing this book.
1,Pablum for managers,"This book is useless, except perhaps as a very gentle introduction to the subject for technophobic managers. I'm returning it in the morning. Programmers, steer clear."
1,Not Useful,"This book was purchased during the execution of an MQSeries project. It was opened once, put down and never referred to again. Perhaps as an introduction to those who have no background in queuing or distributed processing it would be helpful."
3,Lattice Pie Crust,"When this works, it's great, but it is hard to use. I use it primarily for mini pie tops for my Brevelle pie maker. If I first roll it in flour I can usually get a good cut. I can't imagine trying to use it for a full size pie."
1,Great idea. Doesn't work,"We requested this toy as a gift for our 1 year old for her birthday. Straight out of the box it didn't work. The songs will play, but on the wrong page. And we could never get the five little monkeys song to play."
2,Don't buy this album!,"This album was a horrible disappointment. It just arrived today and I was so excited to hear it. But what a surprise! Parts of ""I Was Born 10,000 Years Ago"" are stuck on the end of every track! It totally ruins the song! And these are, otherwise, great tunes.I gave the album two stars only because at least the bonus tracks weren't wrecked. But I'd really like to just return this album and get the songs some other place. And, as I didn't read anything about this in the description, I feel cheated."
5,Elvis Country,"If you have ever purchased any other Elvis product, this is a must for your collection. I had been searching for over 5 years for this on a CD and it brought back so many memories of this wonderful artist of our times!"
3,Measurements were off,"The quality of this cushion was very good. Unfortunately, it was 4 inches shorter than stated. So, it would not work for my chair. I don't understand why they were so far off in the measurement. I had to send it back."
4,Solid Bag for Cheap Price,"I love the style of this sling-bag. It hangs comfortably and allows easy access to its contents without taking it off. The only two potential downsides I noticed were: 1) It is not very big inside. It can hold a decent amount of items, but do not expect to carry more than 5 books or so. 2)The clasp that allows you to adjust the strap length is too weak and can slip, but it has only happened to me once after heavy use for a month. Overall, for the price, I recommend it."
2,OK BAG,I was so looking forward to receiving this bag. But upon receipt I feel that the strength of the bag is not so great and it feels flimsy. The large compartment zipper closes very loosely and is not feel secure. Definitely not the quality of a Jansport backpack quality.
3,"Great story, too long/repetitive","This book had sections that were very original and insightful but others were tedious and repetitive. I ended up skimming sections where the same descriptions of different places started, they should have been eliminated by the editor. One of the most annoying was the obsession with whether or not she was getting ripped off or the maybe it was her condemning of people who thought they were always getting ripped of. I couldn't really tell, she says at one point that she thought she was above it and it was irrelevant then spent way too much time in many sections talking about it.The sample sent from Amazon was brilliant writing so I now she is good but I think it got to the point of filling up pages after awhile hence the three star rating."
4,Fast and interesting read,This was a can't-put-down book that I read from cover to cover in one sitting. It's a really intriguing story and well written for someone who doesn't seem to have any prior professional writing experience. Very inspiring for anyone who's thought about picking up and travelling but hasn't found the guts to do it.
2,disappointing,"i anxiously awaited the arrival of this book, as i plan a bicycle tour of mongolia in 2003.note: too fixated on being the ""first"".too whingey.too dependent on the charity of rural folks.too ""journally"". it was as if she didn't grow after the trip, merely transcribed her journal.please note that i felt her endeavor phenomenal."
4,Some things never change,"Cal Thomas traces the history of liberal politics and gives a brilliant defense of conservative values. Though the book is now 15 years old, it deals with many moral, political, and religious issues that are still very contemporary. My only wish is that he would have expanded some of the op ed columns into full-length chapters."
3,Ugh,"I guess this game was entertaining in the early PSX days but it has not fared well over the years. The controls are tedious, the gameplay is choppy and jerky, and nothing is really intuitive. It is generally a confusing game. Don't get me wrong, there are some original PlayStation titles that I still love to this day -- Gran Turismo 2, Medal of Honor, Syphon Filter, MDK, and Metal Gear Solid come to mind. Steel Reign just seems like it was a tester or demo more than a full game. Not very well done."
4,Excellent Book for Mystery Lovers!,"This is a very good piece of detective fiction from 1920's Great Britain. Even if you weren't a fan of the genre, you would be after reading this. It is an excellent psychological mystery even though it has very little of the breath-taking action characteristic of most mysteries. It pulls you into the plot gradually until you finally can't put it down. It all starts with a mysterious photo of what appears to be a man attempting to shoot another man that is found by our detective, James Flint, in one of his library books. From here we are taken on a journey to exonorate an innocent man and to identify a killer."
4,Good book and a change of setting.,"This certainly was different. I have read his other Xanth novels and this one seems to change the scene and I don't mean it's alternate worlds. Most of if not all the other books were centered around the royal family or those in close contact with them. Mare Imbri has hardly done anything involving the Royal Family since Nightmare. And there is Forest a very confused but versitile faun (hence the name). Also we get to see the strange and fascinating world of Ptero. It certainly gave us something new and interesting to explore, although I would have thought that we might have heard,by now, about whatever happened to Jenny Elf."
3,Easy read on the status of modern men,"This book examines trends, real and alleged, in male roles. Its main strengths are its numerous examples, interesting interviews and chapter summaries of key points, which make for easy reading. Marian Salzman, Ira Matathia and Ann O'Reilly discuss a wide range of contemporary celebrities and ideas. Readers who have been paying attention to the social changes of the past few decades won't be challenged to think more deeply, but others may find something of interest in this review of trends in the men's rights movement. Just watch out for glib generalizations based on a random list of sources that includes Web sites, small newspapers of unknown accuracy and the occasional scholarly journal. We cautiously recommend this book to popular culture vultures and to marketers who wish to track social trends."
1,"Future of Men looks bleak, indeed.","This has to be the most disappointing book of its type. The authors seem to miss the point on men (18-34) all together & make some rather conflated claims. A year later & still no real sign of the Ubersexual, he doesn't exist, and much like Ms Salzman's study of the youth market - it seems she is well out of her reach here, not understanding in a sound & solid way what changes are actually occurring in the world today.Further to this, as someone working in the interactive media realms, and advertising in a much more effective way to a key demographic the authors think they are defining - I agree with the Spotlight reviewer - if you are buying this as an aid, you & your agency are in trouble, if you are buying it to see the confabulated claims of ""so-called"" Populizer (sic - see her website) of Buzzwords and how traditional Madison Avenue misses the mark, unless you are buying it used at $1.13 - you're getting ripped off."
5,Forever Classic,"Survivor series 5th annual was a blast to watch the team of flair vs. the team of rowdy was probly the best match except for the end ,how it ended in DQ. This match took place during the piper flair rival. 2nd match was probably the worst tino santana or someONE takes on some other GUYS? I dont even know there names and i am a die hard wrestling fan. 3rd match was the late and great Hulk Hogan (champ) vs the Best in my opinion THE UNDERTAKER! tHIS WAS A CLASSIC BOUT and even better the undertaker wins but throughout the night monsoon wont shut up about how taker cheated. 4th match was rockers + bushwackers vs. beverly brothers + amd nasty boys an overal 4 star not bad for a match i thought would be bad. The final match was Boss man and Legion of Doom vs. I.R.S and the natural disasters not bad but hogan and takers match should of been the grand fanaly.wORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!"
3,"You'll Survive, but....","The Hogan V.S. Undertaker was, for its time, one of the better promoted matches that the WWF (now WWE) was capable of. Undertaker had come in at the 1990 Survivor Series as a mystery partner for Ted Dibiase's team, and had gotten the Superman push on TV ever since. It's hard for wrestling fans not to notice a wrestler who is given permission to blow off all his opponents moves, making it look like none of it hurts. Typically, a wrestler has to ""sell"" his opponents' moves, making them look good in the process; not so for the 'Taker. Hogan was, of course, the big name in wrestling, as the previous year's attempt to replace him with the Ultimate Warrior proved unprofitable. So the Undertaker and Hogan clashed. The match was not great, but high on drama, and if not for the botched finishing piledriver, it would have been passable. The rest of the card was solid."
3,"Tried the Demo, Liked it, Tried the game, Hated it.","The game, Thunder Truck Rally is true to the saying, don't judge a book by it's cover. The cover on the game looks nothing like the actual game. The demo that I had was great, the computer was easy to beat and the cars handled how you might expect. In the game, it was just the opposit. Me being a very hard core racing game player, couldn't even qualify to go into a time trial without putting in a cheat code. I guess that it might be okay if you got the hang of it."
2,Advanced,"This dvd is not for beginners, and so it is not what I was looking for. The instructors jump right into some advanced moves with little to no explanation about how to get into the positions they got in. I suppose this dvd would be better suited for a more experienced yoga athlete, but novices will injure themselves if they attempt the stunts on this disk."
5,The King of Music,"when Michael Jackson was a Kid you always knew he just had that certain ""IT"" that Legends are made of. his records as a Kid especially these songs featured showcase his greatness and depth. His voice sounds incredible. he was like a kid with a 40-50 year Old Man's range and emotions in his vocal delievery and overall presentation. I mean MJ's musical expressions and reach even back then was 2nd to no one. the arrangements, Productions, instrumentations and the songs are all timeless. He has always been the King. these songs are timeless and the Artist singing them is the same. One of a Kind then and Now. SOULFUL!!!!"
1,Left wing propaganda at its best,"I could not believe how slanted this book is. Joseph Healey paints whites and Christians as potential closet racists. He makes a point to say they are all ""proud to be American"". In fact if you do not believe there is discrimination or that some minority groups are responsible for their own situations you are a ""Modern Racist"".Want to get a definiton of ""reverse racism"" in this book about racism? Nope. Won't find it. It was amazing how Healey doesn't even try to look unbiased.If you hate America and want to blame whites for everything (even though according to Healey whites can't be considered a minority even where they might be fewer in numbers) you will love this book. Don't expect too many facts though."
3,Good for meditation,"A wide variety of short, insightful readings. A good first step to morning prayers and mediation. It probably isn't the best book of its type but still good."
5,Drive By,"Titos brother got shot by gang members. Titos,mom,cop found the killers. Titos big brothergot shot by his own gang. Titos big brother saved money for them so they can move out cause he knew he was going to die. friends were helping Tito,some of them protected Tito. When Tito went to his old house and started snooping around he saw the gangmembers car outside then he hid his friend grabbed him and dragged him into the neighbor yard. Its a good thing Titos neighbor let him live with her. Tito's family had to find who killed Titos brother ,where theylive,hangout,where they go all the time,and what kind of car they drive?you have to read the whole book to find out the information."
5,*drive-by*,"Bang,Bang!!! Thats, the last thing Tito, the main charecter, heard, when his brother jimmy was shot and killed on the streets of L.A. With Jimmy gone, hif family is in danger because he has somthing the gangbangers want and only Jimmy and Tito know there is money for them. Now the gangbangers are after Tito and his family so they can protect their drug money. And now, Tito is trying to find the money before the gangnagers do.If u like suspense and action you might like this book.when i read it i could not put it down. Every suspensful page kept me from putting down this very good book."
3,Brought back memories,I remember when this movie first came out and then got banned and was removed from practically every movie theatre back in the early 1980's. Watching it again today showed me how things have changed. What was horrific back then is nothing compared to what is out there today. Nightmare still has some good scenes but modern technology (special effects) has left this movie in the dust. It is still worth watching if you want to see what raised so many eyebrows in its day but the slasher movies of today are much better.
3,Hmmmmm,"I bought this book several years ago, and in today's education market, you really have to know someone to get a job. And be young, just starting out (cheap), and not have a master's degree (still cheap). This book is not really helpful. Meeting with someone from your college career office for interview practice and resume help would be more beneficial."
5,freedom and joy,Martins obviously has the talent and the freedom which brings new life even to favorite classical pieces - the freedom of imagination that Bach himself must have had. And the joy of it!
3,returned,had to return because they didn't fit. they need to come in half sizes. But they looked and felt nice. I think they were a little pricey though
5,Was a hit at Christmas,Very nice slippers. Glad I didn't go for another brand. These are so comfortable. Very well made and have a true fit.
2,A Nice Format With OUTDATED Maps.,I knew when I bought this map book that it wasn't new and would not be totally up to date. However the maps in the book were out of date before the book was even published!I say skip the book and buy a GPS.
5,Love Parker,"Parker is a very cool professional who takes adversity in stride, not loking for excuses, but rather looking for solutions."
2,Nostalgic Kitsch on a Theme of Guaraldi,"...or, how to make a quick buck on someone elses stuff. Or, to summarize with a trite phrase, ""Can't Beat the Real Thing"". The legendary Guaraldi wrote jazz that is akin to American culture, and is loved by all. This translation takes something that was perfect and takes it down the other side of the peak. Isn't it enough to enjoy the original works without embellishing it with some popular anecdotes? Would you buy Steely Dan from anyone but Fagen? It just misses the mark, and screws up a good thing."
5,Outstanding and courageous book,"White males are living a lie if they don't read Jane Marcus's heroic efforts to portray women's responses to literature as substantially different and independent of males' responses. The anger that women feel when they are continually told that women's literature is worthless, is stupid, and unimportant is displayed with devestating clarity in this work. It seems that women read more empathically, are better able to identify with characters' feelings, and are more able to experience rage at the injustices inherent in a fictional work; males, on the other hand, seem to desire books that contain violence, explicit sexism, and patriarchal systems of networks which exclude women from power structures. This book is a must read for women who wish to show that what they read is not ""trivial"" or ""stupid"" because a woman wrote it, it is trivial and stupid sexism that posits that what women have to say is not worth hearing."
2,It will protect your mini....,"but the touch wheel is harder to use.I bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it. Since that point time I had a harder time turning it off/pausing, adjusting the volume, using the back and forth touch points, and setting a stop point in a audiobook. This is the result of the mini being recessed into the case.I took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again. The case will protect your mini without a doubt - but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for.Also, make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since I nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip.I'll only use when absolutely necessary now."
5,Necessary Resource,"Gregory Graybill says -- ""I have used this book as the main reference to develop my company's flavor control program. Chapter 16 - Sensory Evaluation in Quality Control - has been especially useful"". Gregory Graybill, Director of Quality at Precise Food Ingredients."
3,Pretty nice camera...,"This camera works fairly well, and I've been able to take some really nice photos with it. The biggest problem I've had with it is that it takes batteries (instead of having a rechargeable battery...), and it doesn't take very good close-ups."
2,Features to price ratio good; LCD high mortality,Low price for decent little pix. Red eye doesn't correct. This is my second of these in 3 years. I am a point and shoot grandmother. Met my needs except the LCDs are fragile and both cracked or died within 16 months. No more Kodak for me. I am graduating to a Canon ELPH or whatever is new in '08.
2,Eats Batteries!!,"I have had my C743 for over a year now. Over all I have been happy with the ease of use and basic picture quality. The one major drawback is how many batteries this thing will burn through. I have tried several brands of rechargeables and standard batteries. At first I would get 25+ pictures before the camera would shutoff, now over a year later I get 1-2 pictures before it shuts itself off. For the amount of stress and extra cost for batteries I strongly suggest a different camera."
1,broke before I even used it!,"This is the second kodak 743 I had. The first one just stopped working for no reason. It was past the 1 year warranty,so nothing I could do. I loved the camera and wanted another,but when I received it and put the battery in,the screen was cracked. I guess I'll try another model"
4,Great for jewelry that isn't overly intricate.,"This product works very well on most things (my primary use for it is jewelry.) The only problem I've had has been with cleaning my more intricate jewelry. I don't fault the product for this, I'm just writing it in my review to let other consumers know that if they're looking for a product to clean very detailed stuff, they might have better luck with a cleaner that allows them to fully immerse their pieces. I love the size of the cloths and would definitely purchase this product again."
3,An Emotional Ride,"After You'd Gone was such an emotional book ~ in so many ways. I have never read a book that touched on love and loss in such a beautiful and right to the core kinda way, as this book does. You will feel every feeling and thought that each of these wonderful characters goes through ~ whether it's good or bad.Maggie O'Farrell has done a wonderful job at bringing the reader right into the story. You can't help but wrap your arms around Alice, the main character. You will feel the depth of her love, the deep wounds of her loss, and the helplessness of her being in a coma.My only wish for this brilliant book, was that the ending didn't come to such an abrupt end. I felt like I invested so much of my heart and time into this story and it just ended ... BOOM... just like that. A very quick ending that didn't do the story justice, in my opinion."
4,Love Hurts,"~ Great opening scene, keeps you wanting to know ""why?"" The story has many layers and tells the love story flawlessly through various perspectives. Reveals many hurtful truths about why families are the way they are and why we want something totally different from the type of family we come from. Mysterious yet a relevant read."
3,Interesting....but left me hanging,I liked this book. Each chapter jumps from present day to past events leading to this unknown horrible event that you are reminded of in every chapter but you don't know what it is. I liked the book but I only gave it 3 stars b/cs I didn't like the ending.
4,"Nice product, but a bit uncomfortable","I works well, good sound quality and the microphone also works very well.Problem: It hurt ears if you wear it more than 20min or so."
4,Great Quality,"I gifted this headset to my sister, she liked it very much. She says it is comfortable and easy to use and the sound quality is great. So my word is go for it, a good investment and a worth for the money."
5,None more rocking,"Whoooooooooooo!!!!Instructions for listening to GWO: Disengage higher brain functions, consume artifical stimulant(s) of your choice to excess, plan over-the-top evening of licentious debauchery, crank to 11, bang head against wall. Repeat.Enjoy!!"
3,This CD will not 'Keep on rolling'.....,"This CD. sounds worse than many of REO's songs I have heardeither on the radio, on on DVD. I am surprised because Sony,[whose Audio CD-R's I use for clients]should know better.There is something not quite right with the sound quality.In the case of the song [for example]'Can't fight this feeling'there seems to be a section of piano playing missing. Or itis only on the 12"" extended mix?? [nigh impossible to get holdof] Does anyone have one? Well at least the manic guitaristsounds good.[Even though he looks dis-interested on stage].REO Speedwagon have millions of fans, due to their constanttouring back in the day, and have sold millions of records.If you are a true ""Speedwagon"" type of guy or girl, I wouldrecommend you stay away from this compilation. There's lot'sto choose from in the Amazon REO marketplace.Merry Christmas."
2,Sound is aweful,It's the same as the so called remastered hits and high infidelity cd's that were out a few years ago . It was a very poor remaster job back then and you would have thought they would have doen it right like the new Sammy hagar compilation . Not a chance . Very dissapointed .
5,Happy upbeat music,I grew up with this music. This music will never die. Have not seen talent like this since the Welk Show....
3,"Great ability, but plays too fast","Scott Joplin himself defined ragtime as mid-tempo, not to be played too fast. Jo Ann Castle absolutely rips through Maple Leaf Rag and the others, and ruins them by doing so. Great technical feat, lousy artistic interpretation. Rags are not meant to be played as fast as possible.Also, introducing other instruments into the mix destroys the simple beauty of a single piano, which is all ragtime really needs. The other instruments are also too far in front of the mix, and end up being annoying, because all one is really interested in hearing is Jo Ann's piano.This is pleasant, but the purist in me says that these aren't the best interpretations of ragtime classics that you can buy. Joplin probably would have been yelling ""Slow down!"""
3,Quality,It's not what I was thinking it would be when I got it. It looks so much better in the online picture.
5,i felt like i was a soldier in the marine core,"ok maybe not since this is ARMY acu, not marine core. still i felt hardcore wearing the shirt. i am about 6 ft high and oredered medium and it fits well. i roll up my sleeves and i looks cool. i was in the forest and it was effective camofloauge as others had a hard time seeing me. overall i recommend."
5,must read for Financial Services targeting the Retailer,"If you are a Sales Professional providing Point of Sale solutions to the retail market, this may be the breakthrough you've been looking for. ""Good Selling"" does an outstanding job of interspersing fundamentals of Human Interaction (a la Dale Carnegie) with specific techniques for increasing Sales. Neophytes to Bankcard/Point of Sale Services will appreciate Paul Green's coverage of the fundamentals, while veterans enjoy a refresher course and gain the benefit of Paul's research into the latest trends within the Financial Services community, and how recent technology is impacting today's market. Anyone interested in self-improvement, increased motivation, or just more sales will enjoy the read!"
3,A mix of popular and less known,"This is a compilation like any other. It includes original versions of a few songs that charted well in their time, ""I Will Survive,"" ""High Energy,"" and ""Feels Like I'm in Love."" The Kool and Gang Hit, ""Ladies Night"" is also on the album, but it is not the radio version. While the Trammps, ""Disco Inferno"" was part of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, many may not remember another Trammp hit which is on this album, ""Hold Back the Night."" ""Hold Back the Night,"" hit number 35 on the US Hot 100. ""Givin Up, Givin In"" is a B-side song from '78. I also like ""Young Hearst Run Free,"" and ""Givin in, Givin up.""If you collect music, this CD is a good buy as long as you pay less than $10.00."
5,Long time owner,"I've owned the quartz version of the James Bond Omega since the first year it was introduced. I think I bought it more than ten years ago. I own many watches and this is my favorite and the best I own. Battery life is five plus years. The watch has a built in warning of low battery (second hand jumps every two seconds) and leaves you at least a month to change it after the warning. Accuracy is remarkable. Because you don't have to stop the watch to adjust for daylight savings time, I can say that the watch gains fewer than five seconds per year; this is why I don't understand why one would buy a mechanical version. While the case has endured reasonable scratches, the crystal is perfect. I paid about $800 (discounted) for the watch many years ago and have never regretted the purchase. I can sell it today on ebay for about what I paid for it. What other new product can you say that about? You will never regret buying this watch."
5,"Love this watch, very nice",This watch is rugged and elegant. I have had no problems with this watch. The blue dial is striking and stands out. Not too heavy on the wrist.
2,Band scratches easily.,"This Omega Men's 2221.80.00 Seamaster 300M Quartz ""James Bond"" Blue Dial Watch is a great looking watch. The only problem is that the watch band scratches very easily. Then you have to find another band, and that is very hard!!"
3,THPS 2 best on the disk,"The demo has few good ones on it, but the good ones make up for all the bad. good:THPS 2, Midevil 2, Spiderman Bad: Grind session, everything else"
5,Culture shock,You will find this book funny and original even you have not been in Japan. If you have...well just amazing!
3,Not the best in the series,"Murder at the Library of Congress is definitely not Truman's best work in the capital crimes series. Annabel Reed-Smith is commissioned to write an article on Colombus at LC. With a couple of murders thrown in the mix - one new and one 8 years old, she gets a bit side-tracked. Truman does keep the reader engaged, following an art thief on a cross-country trek, as well as interesting descriptions of LC. However, the plot around Annabel is without its usual punch. And, for fans of husband Mac, he is sadly in a much more backstage role. In fact, the aggressive news reporter does most of the crime solving for Annabel and Mac. Overall, an okay read, but not her best."
4,Pitching book,This book really helps you learn new pitches and a lot of new techneeks but the book did have a page that had a highlighter pen all over the page
3,Super small,"I am 5 feet tall and got this ball because the manufacturer said it was for my height. It was about the size of a beach ball! The ball quality was fine, but it was too small for me and I had to return it."
1,wish i could rate this product a zero,"My title review says it all. The light control not only dims the light bulb during the night, it doesnt take the light off when dawn hits.Waste of time item."
2,Seems like the socket is too short to make contact?,"It's just not working for me. It seems like the threaded socket may just be too short - it does not screw in nearly as much as the light bulb, and then it just does not go on. Seems like it is not making contact or something..Anyone have any ideas on that?"
5,Birding,"I wanted a pair of binoculars to view birds visiting my cabin and deck. The general distance from my living room is about 30 to 50 feet. The Nikon 7216 works great! The image is sharp and stable. Focusing is fast and easy. This is a quality product, reasonably priced, and I give it 5 Stars. The purchase from Amazon was amazingly easy and quick to order. I received a notification email with details of the sale and tracking information for shipping from the seller. The product arrived UPS ahead of schedule. Amazon shopping helped me to save dollars in my budget versus having to pay for Obama's outrageous green policy with gas costing more than $4.00 per gallon. Obama's GSA could shop Amazon and save tax dollars too."
3,Solid quality but dissapointing,"Solid quality and a good value for the price but disappointing for my use. I bought this for my wife for birdwatching. We have feeders outside a window of our home and attract a wide variety of birds. Problem: If the birds are closer than 16 feet you can not focus on them. Compared with a Minolta binocular we have, this set lacks power too. I should have spent the extra money for a better set."
1,Duplicate Reviews For Different Products,"The reviews here are duplicated between the 10x50, 12x50 and 16x50 binoculars. As a result it's impossible to tell which product any individual review applies to, rendering them all but useless."
4,Nice view,"The overall quality of this product is terrific. Excellent clarity, very crisp. It's as if I am right next to the object I'm looking at. The price couldn't be beat either. I checked all other sites, including the big department stores and no one could beat amazons price."
5,nice bino,"I ordered this based on reco from my friends who are into bird watching and also use it for occasional stargazing.Its really nicely made,though not made in Japan.Optics are the best.I tried stargazing (under city lights).I was able to get clear view of nebula in ORION .Moon craters are clearly visible.Can't make out rings of Saturn .I would higly recommend using tripod for using this bino ,as it is heavy for long use.Tripod adpters are availble but are pretty expensive(~$15-20 or more).I fabricated my own adapter-L-shaped).Highly recommended."
4,all purpose binoculars,"The binoculars came as advertized and I'm pleased. I use them for general purpose wildlife and bird watching. They're not too heavy and ""fit me"" fine - They worked great on a recent trip to Yellowstone - I'd buy them again"
4,Great bins for the price,"I truly love these binoculars. I have identified over 900 species of birds with my 10X50 action. Sure, they will get water in them, and they can fog up at the most infuriating times, but once you know how to treat them in adverse conditions they will always come through. There are better, but do not disregard the brightness and field of view of these binoculars. Under normal daylight, there is really not much better. Porro bins are great. In high contrast, low light conditions you will definitely miss some sharpness, but hey they are 80 bucks. Great for travel, never mind the bulk. Who wants to have to constantly worry about their $500 binoculars getting stolen? These binoculars have treated me very well and I highly recommend them to anyone on a budget."
5,Nikon Action 8x40,"Great binoculars. There is a tree line about 75 feet from my office window. I got the 8x40s to watch the birds that like to play in the trees. They are light enough that I can hand-hold them just fine for a few minutes. Any more than that, and I find myself needing to put my elbows on the desk to keep them steady. What I wasn't expecting was how bright they are! Its like turning up the lights whenever you look through them. Haven't tried looking at the night sky with them yet, but I imagine it would be awesome."
4,Recommended Highly,"I have been very pleased with the performance of my Kitchenaid Burr Grinder. Operation is as simple as it gets and the results are perfect. I make coffee in a variety of ways: drip, press and espresso. The ease of changing size of the grind is an excellent feature. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in fresh ground coffee but particularly for those wanting an assortment of grind sizes."
2,a heavy piece of metal,"This grinder is built like a tank. When you take it apart, the metal gears are solid stainless steel pieces. The machine looks nice on the counter with its chrome finish.However, the constant left-over powders are annoying. There has got to be a better design to prevent this. Also, I found the grind particles are not at all even, no matter how I adjust.A nice looking machine but fall short on performance."
4,Variable performance between grinders,"A good grinder which grinds fine enough for my lever espresso machine. This is my second grinder, of this model, as the first one got drowned in a flood, and it performs better than the first, which could not grind as fine as this one. Variable performance between machines?"
5,Track Listing Correction,Very nice collection of traditional jazz.Correction in track listing. Amazon lists track #14 as14. Bayou Blues - Pete FountainIs is actually14. Red Sails in the Sunset - Erroll GarnerIs it possible there are versions of this CD? I wanted the one with Pete Fountain on track 14.
3,eahh?,"The toy was exeptional because you could step back up to at least 30', although the reaction time (from when you first push the button to when you see the reaction on the screen) was slow. So its not the greatest controler in the world but it will do for me!"
3,Thirteen year old gamer,These contollers are very nice but need a few bugs worked out of them.I have had these controllers about a year and I have found out that they go through the batteries.The best batteries to put in them are rechargeable NIMH.These batteries are high but it is better in the long run than non rechargeable batteries.These controllers are great if you have the right batteries.
5,The next best thing to seeing this performance live.,This performance comes with English subtitles and is the next best thing to seeing this performance live. The Opera is available on CD but this performance is the first in Video DVD and the only one available. Thevideo performance adds a new dimension to the opera.
1,Total exploitation garbage,"This music had zero credibility in 1967. It sounds like record company executives hired some studio hacks to emulate ""psychedelic"" music. Total crap, utterly without value."
1,Didn't work for me,"Can't speak for anyone else, but it didn't work on my Windows 7 system. Also, I was looking for something that could work with android / google maps navigation."
3,complicated,Way to complicated to set up no tutorial or anything. Smaller than i imagined so that is a plus Ask me again after I get it set up
5,Great GPS receiver,"I've used this while sailing, using MacENC or GPSNavX. The receiver can pick up plenty of the signals very fast, and seems to be very accurate. The update rate is at least once/second."
4,Nice simple GPS for development,I purchased this GPS receiver to assist in a GPS driven project. It was very reliable and easy to configure. Like most NMEA compliant receivers it comes with a virtual COM port driver to make communication very easy from any programming language with a serial addressing library (Python and PySerial were great).I did not use it with commercial software but I foresee no issues.
5,Great GPS Receiver on budget!!,"When I was looking for a GPS receiver to go with my Asus EEE PC 4G, I read the reviews I could find and decided i go with BU-353 GPS receiver. My order turned up quickly at my door, installed the drivers and then plugged it into my Asus EEE PC 4G. It registered the location with 8 satelites!We took it on a test drive and very much please with the performance. I would recommend it to friends & others."
3,What software to use?,"Can't find a single program to use this with and have it work they way I need it. I do metal detecting and wanted to record my finds locations so I can keep a log of the ""context"" of the artifact in case the area ever turns out to be significant. Was hoping to use it with my netbook and just pop up a program, have it load a map, Garmin-style, and record the lat/long and take notes of surroundings but I tried may programs to no avail.Any suggestions?"
4,GPS is great but for the right application,"We use this GPS unit in a truck connected to a laptop to inventory our assets. It's size, range and abilities are great. Works better for us than a hand held unit."
5,Works perfectly,I could not be happier as this gps unit works perfectly with my copilot truck application. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a gps for copilot live.
2,Sloppy assembly detracts from excellent performance,"Used in van for about 3 months. Very fast satellite fixes, excellent performance until - it suddenly would stop communicating with my PC. Quickly (one day) stopped working altogether. Since it was out of warranty, I took it home and disassembled. What I found was the solder joint that attaches the chipset to the cable had almost no solder on it, the connection was simply from mechanical pressure. So after bouncing around on my dash for 3 months it jarred loose, and no more GPS. An email to USGlobalSat received absolutely no response. So now I know why they have a 60 day warranty. Too bad, it really works great while it works."
5,Works perfectly on my sailboat.,I use the GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Navigation Receiver connected to my computer to run marine Navigational software on my 40 ft. sailboat. I just put it up against the port window and it connects quickly and accurately.
5,GlobalSat BU-353,"Great product, great price. Works perfectly first time. Just plug and play, so easy. Wish the cord was a little longer so could route it better, but no complaints."
1,2nd one bad as the first,"After 1st one failed within 4 hours of use and it was out of the 30 day warranty, I decided to purchase another because when it worked, I liked the way it worked. However, second one only lasted 2 hours before it also stopped tracking. Needless to say, I'm done with that product and manufacturer!"
5,Great little GPS unit,"While I haven't used this unit for long, it has operated flawlessly in the time I have had it. Even indoors (within 15 feet of a large window) I get 8 to 10 satellites. The unit is small, compact, magnetically mounted and perfect for use with a laptop. the cord is a tad short for some larger vehicle, but a USB extension cord solves this problem.I purchased this unit as it has good Linux support (my intended platform) though all testing was done under Windows 7 on a netbook."
4,"Soild, but outdated...","A very good starter book for sure. In other words, if ya know little about recording or sound mechanics, pick it up, but it is definetly outdated. Its amazing how far sound recording has come in the last 15 or so years. The digital machines mentioned in here are nothing like the ones out now. Even the portastudios in here are obsolete. Generally good advice for most instruments but hey, I'm a drummer and that section needs to be revamped big time. No serious mentions of the perks of edrums in the studio, and that is a major plus in todays recording studio. Like I said earlier, if McLan decides to upgrade this book, it will be the go-to guide for beginners, but as is, it is a solid, not spectacular book."
2,Out Of Date,"The general content in the area of how-to was ok, but with so much reference to open reel tapes and minimal to digital recording made it disapointing. Copyright dated 1988, 1994, the changes not covered that have taken place in the last five years are amazing. The pointers on mic-ing are good, along with ideas on getting cleaner recorded tracks. I am getting a lot more out of ""Home Recording Power!"" by Ben Milstead. It is slanted toward the CakeWalk Sonar software, but gets things moving fast! The sugestions are current as well."
4,Good purchase,My son loves this game. Came as described and on time! Game just as my husband remembered from his childhood.
5,Paint Shop Pro Is a Winner!,"As an aspiring web designer, I was tired of using Microsoft Paint and other cheap graphics programs to get by. So, after getting hooked on a trial, I received it for my birthday. After picking up different aspects of it, I was quite impressed with its capabilities.Many people see Adobe Photoshop as the primere of all graphics programs. (...) . This is the superior alternative. I started out simple with it. I learn basic colors and text. Then I moved on to touching up photos, transparency, gradients and more. Then, I progressed to optimization, image slicing & mapping, and other advanced features. Sound over your head? It was for me, but this program can turn you from a beginner into and expert (at least it did for me).PROS:- great interface- cheap price- powerful yet simpleCONS:- none yet"
3,Don't let it trick you!,"I bought Paint Shop simply for photo editing, however noticed on the box that ""you can create cards, CD covers, and other home publications""... After looking throughout the encluded book and navigating through the acutal program for an 2 hours I ended up having to buy another home publishing program for things of that sort, despite the fact that JASC advertised these capabilities on the box. Otherwise it's great for photos, but just keep in mind: THAT'S ALL IT DOES!"
4,Great Value & Quality,"Its hard to find Cassette Stereo Players for cars anymore But this is a great buy for the price . The diplay is very easy to read even in light , with a built in clock . The sound quality is very good ( I had to change my old speakers too) The tape doesnt come off automatically after you shut down the car but thats ok . I had it installed in my Honda Accord 1990 ( great model by the way) whose original one starting making grinding noises . I dont recommend the cheap ones , the installation job was expensive (professional) and you dont want to do it again . Cructhfield service was excellent delivery and feedback"
2,Damaged in shipping,"I thought I'd save a little (actually, a lot) and purchase two boxes of Paslode nails from Amazon. The shipment arrived in a rather oversized cardboard carton (8x12x6"") with loosely wrapped bubble pack. Apparently the boxes had come free of the bubble pack in transit. One box of nails had opened, and most of the 100-nail sticks had separated into 3 to 5 nail segments. I did not contact Amazon regarding this problem but feel better packing (e.g. bubble pack wrapped and taped around each box) should be provided. The loose nails are a pain to load but seem to work fine."
4,Furnace Filters,"Product arrived as expected, no damages. I received the correct size, and I will expect to order them again...."
4,Charming! But...,"This DVD includes three episodes from the HBO series. However, two episodes (""Gilbert the Gorilla"" and ""Business Girl"") are included on the ""Little Lulu: Green Girl"" DVD and the third episode, ""Friends and Enemies"" is included on the ""Little Lulu: Friends and Enemies"" DVD. So, if you already have those, you don't need this one."
4,nice gun!,"nice gun, it shoots about 320 fps and its worth for the price.. its great gun for begginers and its has a very hard plastic. ( some metal parts )"
3,"Looks great, not very durable","Gun looks great, neat option but the accessories like the silencer, barrel, and cartridge all broke within a week. For a full auto gun, having a clip that only holds 45 shots is ridiculous."
3,Almost Great....,"I opened this product and was very surprised at the quality. I started adding attachments and then wanted to test it. It seemed to come with a charge already and when I tried to shoot it nothing happened. I am not sure if all guns are like this but you have to have more than a couple of the ammo in the clip otherwise the spring doesn't load it properly when you shoot. Once I loaded more ammo it shot fine.The problem: the mounted scope on the top is blocked by the iron sites at the end of the gun. This bothers me since it makes the mounted scope useless with these giant iron sights in the way that as far as I can tell you cannot remove them. Everything else rocked, it came with a lot of addons and works great."
2,Rip Off,******This gun IS a m83 AEG airsoft gun NOT a navy commando M-16******* So I was teased into a more expensive buy. I payed like 70$ for this when I could have gotten the SAME m83 for a lesser price. Also it took FOREVER to ship and plus mine didn't even come with a laser (not that its a big deal but it should come with everything advertised) all and all I guess its decent at best. Good for a first gun but it was soo misleading and more expensive.
3,ok,This product is a really nice tri-pod. However from the description I thought that it was a remote controlled tri-pod. Instead it came with a remote control for the camera not the tri-pod. But it was a Christmas present and she loved it any way.
1,very poor DVD,"Just got this Dvd out of the box for a 2nd look after a few months and know why I put it away, This DVD is simply bad!! quality poor crappy video, looks like a 3rd generation video The audio is poor also with its supposed 4.1,How they get away with releasing such rubbish beats me how an Artist of Rogers standing can give this the go ahead, he must never have had a look at this result it's an insultI get fed up of buying inferior DVD quality its not just this one, the situation is pathetic anything goes, stick it on a DVD and everyone thinks the quality will be just wonderful, There just is no apparent Quality measurements of late in the production of so many DVDS, We should return all these discs and complain to the producers, God help us. We may as well stick to VHS it getting to the same standard."
5,EXCELLENT vocabulary builder,"I own at least 12 books on vocabulary building and LOVE this book! It utilizes etymology, the study of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. Once you know and understand the meaning of roots, prefixes, and suffixes, it unlocks the meaning of THOUSANDS of words, even if you've never seen or heard them before. VERY powerful vocabulary builder, in my opinion. HIGHLY recommended."
3,waiting for deeper exploration,Again we should be amazed at these wonderful algorithmic creatures that have continued to sprawl for the last half a century or more. The innovation about this type of experimentation if at all it is anymore should lie on the reality and materiality of the projects. We cannot let technology invent architecture but to at least keep up if not produce it. Lynns dialogues will only be convincing if the show doesn't end up or formulate by gyp board.
5,KISS:KISSOLOGY,Absolutely awesome! You will NOT be disappointed! My kids can't wait to go to a KISS concert now and they are only 5 and 7.
3,A Lousy KISS,"Yet another ripoff item by Gene and the gang of KISS. The video is of poor VERY POOR quality. With all of today's technology you can't tell me that the video couldn't be cleaned up at all? Alot of it appears that the audio was overdubbed to make the group sound better. This is just a rip off and I was able to get it for $13. STAY AWAY as you will be able to pick this up, if you really want it, on eBay soon for .99 cents plus shipping. Last KISS item I ever purchase."
2,Nothing like I expected,"If you are looking for a quality sound and picture concert of KISS this aint it. Being a very big KISS fan I was somewhat diappointed to see some in black & white. Some of the footage looked more like a bootleg than a quality dvd. Anyway I am still waiting for one great concert, in color, with great sound quality and picture quality. I remember years ago seeing a concert on Directv. I would sure like to get my hands on that one in remastered dvd quality. Very disappointed in this dvd myself."
5,YOU WANTED THE BEST YOU GOT THE BEST!!!,Kissology vol. 1 is a treasure trove of vintage Kiss concerts. A must have for all Kiss fans! Every minute of footage is pure gold!
1,Started leaking after 6 months,I really liked this shower head. Unfortunately it developed a leak in the selector that just continues to get worse. Its useless after 6 months.
2,Fixed head = almost useless.,"I purchased this hoping it would solve the problem of low water pressure in my apartment. It does, but only if you set the nozzles to center-fire, which feels like a hose. If you want to use the outer water jets, they only work in non-massage mode. The biggest problem with this series is that the shower head isn't on a pivot ball like 99% of the other shower heads in the world. It *LOOKS* like a pivot through the packaging, which is extremely deceptive. Why Waterpik couldn't spend the extra dollar to make this a functioning positional head is beyond me. As it stands, wherever the shower head points when you screw it on to your pipes is where it will ALWAYS point."
3,Good but outdated,"Project Remember is a good resource book for grave hunters but is very out of date (published in 1986). It's good to have, though!"
1,Stay away!,This is easily the worst recording of any Sondheim musical. Most of the brilliant songs from the stage show are cut and replaced by awful underscore by someone else. This sound track is so totally pointless unless you are the kind of sondheimaniac who has to have absolutely all recordings made of Sondheim songs. Personally I regret byuing it.
3,Only Fair,"Sure, most the songs from the original play were lost in the film version, but as a film it is enjoyable on it's own terms. After all, the ratio of faithful transitions from Broadway to Hollywood is about 100 to 1. However, this soundtrack is not all that great due to poor mixing and a negligent transfer to disc."
1,Very inconvenient!,I have YET to be able to print out a list of samples. To see a sample you have to select a font from an unreadable list of strange names that do not have ANYTHING to do with what the font looks like. HATE this stupid program!
5,Great Tshirt!,My daughter loved the Tshirt and it came in handy for her story book character costume for school. Great Purchase!
4,How to Succeed in a Musical,"I fell in love with this musical when my friend's parents performed in a local production of it. Years later, I still know almost every word. I have the remake, but I find that Robert Morse has a much warmer voice. Somehow, more joy or whimsy seems to resonate from his rendition than the newer cast recording. When I hear the introduction, the orchestra manages to transport me to the streets of New York. The songs are witty at times (Secretary is Not a Toy) and flirty at others ( Lee and Morse together). At all times, the songs remain very listenable. For fans of Original Cast Recordings or Movie Musicals this is one for the collection."
3,"Go back to the book, J. Pierrepont","After working with Blue Eyes, Nelson Riddle got a suitably inflated impression of himself, and he took it out on one of Frank Loesser's best scores with a big dose of bombast. Why use understatement when you can have a symphonic orchestra doink and boink all over the place? That Riddle got himself in over his swelled head was no clearer than when he decided to replace the quote from Grieg's Piano Concerto in ""Rosemary"" with something better. As Pauline Kael said of Rex Harrison in the film version of My Fair Lady, everyone here seems to have done this a million times already -- Rudy Vallee is in bad voice here -- but Robert Morse is Old Faithful, singing well if a bit too cuddly for a thirty-five-year-old. Like Rykodisc's other ""MGM"" albums, this is straight from the LP masters, complete in this case with several truncated tracks and not-quite-top-notch sound. Stick with Victor's five-star '61 cast album.P. S. Was Robert Q. Lewis really as smarmy as I remember him?"
2,"If you do not like player piano tunes, beware of this CD","I did not realize this CD contains player piano tunes. If the rest of the title had appeared online, I would have reconsidered. After listening to a few, they tend to sound alike."
4,Anthem for a new band,"Better than most anything else that's come out recently. Speed of Mutation and Burn it Down are excellent examples of Ben Weasel's ability to pen intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics. The music is generally hard and fast - the new line-up on this record is less melodic, more pounding on the door."
5,This game rocks!,"This game is the best you will love it if you are a DBZ fan. The graphics are solid the sounds are great and the gameplay is awesome. The characters are Goku,Pan,Super Vegeta,Majin Boo,Gohan,Piccolo,Little Goku,Frieza,Cell and Trunks. There is also hidden charaecters and they are DBZ Super Goku,DBGT Super Goku,Super Trunks,Future Super Trunks,Super Vegetto and even the great one Super Saiyan 4 Goku. Thats my review for Dragonball GT Final Bout."
5,So Cool!,"This game is so cool!!! The American version is being RE-RELEASED!!!!! Buy it while you can! Also, click on the picture above, it will show the cover bigger, and a second screenshot. The second screenshot is actually from DBZ: Legacy of Goku 2."
4,Dragonball GT Final Bout,"First of all i am an anime expert, an personally i think neon genises evangelion is the best anime. ok now for the review. I gave this game 4 stars, becuz it is an awesome game, and has great graphics. The downside is that you will find yourself throwing the controller against the wall when the computer counters all of your beams. but overall, it is a great game.But evangelion is the best tv show"
2,There are better DBZ games,"Allright this game is ok except its one major flaw the responce rate of the controller is poor(Note dont be fooled this game is japanese not the USA version)it has a nice set of character....that repeat like all the gokus are the same just different skins.Honestly if youre going to buy a DBZ game get Ultimate battle 22 or legends theyre much better dont be as shallow to go:""Oh look at thegraphics i have to have that game"" rember PICS can be deciveing!And this is one"
2,Not So Much,"I just got one of these in army green (a size up as always with Bella). I do not like this shirt as much as others of the same brand and would return it if it were not such a hassle. The fabric seems a little cheap and the neck is too snug.I do love the Bella colors (wish ALL their shirts came in all the possible colors), but will probably buy the ones with a touch of spandex or another brand next time."
4,Great Piano Roll Transcriptions,"If you like the music of Jerome Kern and are fond of the sound of the Piano Rolls, this is the album for you. Although not specifically listed as such, these tracks are all transcribed piano rolls recorded on a Steinway Duo-Art Grand piano. Lyrics are included in the booklet, along with a brief biography.These transcriptions are very clean and resonant, adding to your listening pleasure."
4,It's Fun!,"The great thing about Eric Heatherly's debut album is the fact that it is fun...fun to listen to, fun to dance to, and it's obvious that the musicians and Mr. Heatherly are having fun. It's infectious...just as the ""Flowers on the Wall"" remake. It takes the song to a new dimension but maintains the feel of the original. The rest of the CD contains some fun, if average, music, but it's great to hear some rockabilly tunes and artists enjoying their work! Keep it up, Eric."
2,DIsappointing performance,"I have had my Dirt Devil Vision vacuum only one month and already need to change the filter. At $20 per filter, this could be a very expensive vacuum to maintain. I don't have an exceptionally dirty house, and have mostly hardwood floors, so having to replace the filter was a shock. When the filter clogs, the vacuum overheats and shuts down....right in the middle of whatever you are doing. I would never buy another Dirt Devil product after this poor performance."
5,Great product,"This product is perfect for our house. It is light and has plenty of power. The canister system is better than having the bags, you can empty it and never have to worry about it filling up. All around this product is outstanding this is an outstanding product. I would highly reccomend this product."
1,Wow,"I can't believe this horrible vacuum has so many 5 star reviews. This vacuum is a piece of junk. We have had it for over a year now, but never use it, because the first week of use the rug attachment locked up and continuously locked up after every second use. We have long haired cats, so we do have a little extra hair to vacuum up, however it should not cause a brand new vacuum cleaner to lock up every second time it was used. It also doesn't even get down to the carpet dirt. It barely get the dirt that is sitting on top of the carpet! This vacuum is made with flimsy plastic pieces and was the biggest disappointment we have ever purchased!"
3,Canister Vac,"Purchased this as a gift for my mom. Tried it out when I visited and was a bit disappointed. It looks good and has a lot of attachments but I did not think the suction was very good for being a ""turbo"" vac. Have had other style Dirt Devil vacs and have liked them a lot more."
4,"Good vacuum, accessories not high quality","I bought this vacuum after reading many reviews. It's taken some time to get used to a canister vac (I've always used an upright) but now I am and I like it. I've used higher quality ones before, and you can definitely tell the difference between those and this one, but this DD isn't bad. It sucks very well and the different accessories do a good job getting into a variety of spaces. However, I'm not that pleased with the quality of the accessories. The two wide heads (for carpet and hard floors) seem to be not that well made and I wonder how long they'll last. They both have a tab on that back that let you prop them in the notch on the canister and the tab on the carpet attachment has already broken off. I'm going to call DD and see if I can get a replacement.I really like how you can change the motor speed to a higher suction level. The dirt container seems to be a little small and has to be emptied more than I would like."
2,Not for carpets!,"This vacuum is wonderful for hardwood and tile floors, BUT NOT FOR CARPETS!!! I don't even have a high pile carpet, and it gets bogged down and does not move easily. I don't like the bagless cleaner because there is more dust flying into the air when you empty the canister than when you just detach the bag and throw it away. The attachments do not stay attached to the cleaner and easily fall off. The floor nozzle is wonderful because it rotates easily to get into the hardest corners. I am sorry I spent the money for this cleaner and will be buying another for my carpets."
2,Cheap build quality,"This unit did a good job cleaning and the filter stayed relatively clean, but the overall build quality is not quite there. For instance, the power chord is supposed to recoil when pushing the handle or the button under the handle, it never worked. The release for the dirt container feels fairly flimsy. Ultimately I returned it because the power chord did not recoil and this defect is unacceptable for a unit that had literally just come out of the box. So an ok unit if you are looking for something moderately priced with decent performance but mediocre at best build quality."
3,Mine was BROKEN,"I wish that I could give this an accurate rating and review, but when I recieved mine it would not start and dirt devil support was no help to me whatsoever, so it was sent back for a refund and I bought a different vacuum."
4,Overall Good Vacuum Cleaner,"I brought this Vacuum Cleaner since 2009 Summer and still working without any problems. Here are my pro and cons list below.Pros:-less dust when taking out with close container.-works well on hardwood floors.-automatic cord retraction.-the filter has longer uses than Dirt Devil 082500.Cons:-little heavier than Dirt Devil 082500.-for carpet areas, not so well. Still use Dirt Devil 082500 brush for carpet areas.That's about it, pretty good overall product."
4,Review for the Safco Plastic Literature Display,"I purchased this display to clean up my office. After ordering, it arrived in 2 days. Very fast! I mounted it on/behind my door and it is working exactly as I had hoped. I would recommend this purchase to anyone needing a display. Keep in mind though that there are displays that are thicker and maybe more durable out there. For the price and my application, this one works just fine."
5,They sent the wrong book. ;(,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Blood on the Risers"" when I read it a few years ago. Previously my son had started reading my copy and asked me to send him his own for the trip home on the plane. My son was so excited that I sent a special edition of this book to him. Unfortunately when he opened it he had received the book titled ""The Case Against Divorce"" by Diane Medved,Ph.D. The packaging slip had the correct book listed on it. Now I am certain that is not a book my 16 year old wanted to read. He was very disappointed and I did not have time to reorder it to get it to him in time before his flight. Nor was I going to trust that I would receive the correct book. I received credit for the mistake, but that is not the point. So I would like to tell whoever packed the box that they are a blind idiot. There is no way to mistake the two books they look nothing alike. I have a signed copy of the book myself and I can tell the difference immediately."
2,Are all of the great ratings from people who didn't actually cook from the book?,"I cook a lot - both formal and informal fare. The book has some great information and nice ideas, but in reality there are problems with many of the recipes either in the instructions or in the actual outcome. For example, the tomato sorbet tasted like ketchup sorbet. While the verjus sorbet was delicious, it melted very quickly and was thus hard to serve. Also, the crowd I served the verjus sorbet with poached peaches to agreed that the dish was too acidic and needed other elements to balance it out. Another example of a problematic recipe is the striped bass with artichoke ravioli recipe. In this recipe it seems that there were editorial errors and lack of direction. It also seemed unnecessarily laborious for the result. In all, you need to be prepared to labor without too many expectations because you can't be sure what the final outcome will be."
5,Glorious,You can almost smell the valley. Close your eyes and imagine a little piece of heaven.I wish I could use as much caviar and as many truffles as they do at the French Laundry.Try your hands at some marvelous revisited classics. Not for the faint of heart ...
1,Laundry at Trimalchio's?,"This massive book is one of the most precious and pretentious pieces of nonsense I've ever seen. Buy it if you hate to cook but love to impress your social-climbing pals. If you love food and love to cook, save your money and buy Elizabeth David's French Provincial Cooking instead."
2,Coffee table book,Unless you are as talented as Mr. Keller or his staff than forget about ever being able to remake any of his recipes. The 'French Laundry' is to be appreciated as a thing of beauty and not to be duplicated. Keller is to food what Monet is to art. Even a cook by numbers can't even help you come close. The truth hurts.
4,firetruck,this will not be used as a toy. my boyfriend is a firefighter and he collects firetrucks. he loves it
1,B. S.,"Pseudo-intellectual drivel. Don't waste your time reading work that purports to be scholarly (or at least educated) and is in fact the opposite. Random free association about everything under the sun does not constitute ""philosophy."""
4,THE SPIRIT OF JELLY ROLL,"These recordings date from 1968, when Butch Thompson was just 25, and the extent to which he succeeded in capturing the spirit of Morton's playing is quite remarkable. Some of these numbers were never recorded by Morton other than with his band, so it's fascinating to hear tunes such as Jungle Blues and Black Bottom Stomp transcribed for the solo piano. My only criticism is that playing time just tips the scales at a tad over three quarters of an hour."
3,Well I enjoyed it,"I bought this cd along with the broadway version to listen to and help me prepare for my part as Don Quixote in my school play.I thoroughly enjoyed both recordings,and while the broadway version was undeniably more professional,I appreciated hearing these versions of the songs as well.Listen to the audio clips and make your own judgement."
5,2 yr old loves it!,"I wanted to get a dvd about winter and this was ""the one"". My daughter loves it and watch it everyday this month. It's nice that it shows kids celebrating Christmas in other countries. It's long and not very much action, but if she likes it I'm happy."
3,Nothing Special,"I was hoping to taste the chicory more but I couldn't taste it at all. The nibs give a nice texture and the chocolate is good but there's nothing that makes this any better than a $2 Choxie Espresso bar from Target. I prefer the Macha, Golgi, Black Pearl, Calindia or fire bar from the Vosges line."
1,Very misleading picture.,The kit comes completely disassembled with the parts. It takes a long time to put it together. Look for the assembled version when buying.
1,Can anyone say Bias?,"This book had at least two or three relevant points. Unfortunately the author was so busy making the same mistakes he was criticizing others for that it was for me, a book that was difficult to force myself to read. If it had not been assigned for a class, I wouldn't have finished the first chapter. As it was, the one or two points that the author eventually got around to making (in about the 9th or 10th chapter) were interesting, but failed to support the sieve-like logic of the rest of the text. This is a good example of why editing is important, and how this company gets a big fat FAIL from me. They should pay more attention to quality, content, and the logical context of arguments presented, rather than someone claiming to have something relevant to say about these sort of debates. The only reason this book got one star from me is because selecting none was not an option."
5,A MUST have CD !,"I always catch this guy in Vegas. One of the best Blues Musicians/Guitarists I have ever seen. This whole album is awesome, take a listen to the track ""Cadillac"". Check out his website and buy this CD, you won't be sorry."
5,FINALLY!!!!,"Without a doubt THE BEST Anthrax album..These guys have finally made their masterpiece..Cuts like ""Stealing from a thief"", and ""Inside Out"" are just PERFECT!! They could'nt have made a better album..Its too bad their best work will go unnoticed and their old work with Joey Belladonna is all that will probly be remembered..They made their best stuff with ex Saint vocalist John Bush..Anyone who sees this album as less than 5 stars needs to get their head examined.. Pure, Uncompromising music with great production.. A True Masterpiece!!!"
4,different but still much better than metallica at this point,"Anthrax disappeared for a few years and reappeared on an independent label, having lost a good deal of their popularity. Which is entirely unfair, because Anthrax show more energy and consistency here than still-popular contemporaries Metallica and Megadeth have shown the last couple years. This is another great album with great tracks like the tom-tom attack of ""Crush"" and the high energy of ""Catharsis"". There is one joke countryish tune and an acoustic ballad (wisely hidden as a bonus track), but the rest is straight-up heavy metal, deserving of a larger audience."
1,"NOT ""fireworks"", NOT DD 5.1, gruesome surprise!","There is not a firework on the disc, except the cover. The music, while good, is NOT Dolby Digital 5.1 - I heard NOTHING out of the surround channels. The sound ""breaks"" (or ""cuts out briefly"" in multiple spots, and is ACTUALLY set to video of African animals, often around dinner time. The video is often poor quality at that."
3,Wish I actually used this,"What I really want is a poster that I can look at while I'm on the ball. It's difficult to get the hang of the moves when you're holding the book. That said, she has some great ideas of how to use the ball. Some are a little gratuitous, though, and you don't need the ball for them."
2,Not Exactly What I had Expected,"I own a few other ""101 way to"" books and this one disappointed. I expected new exercises to help me with my job as an aerobics instructor, but it failed to do so. Instead a stretch with the ball was labeled as an exercise."
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,"I purchased this unit for work and was very disappointed with the sound quality. I had several people who I would talk to that complained that there was a buzzing noise. I also could not hear the other person very well if there was any sort of low background noise, TV, radio etc...I went back to my wired headset within a week. Needless to say, I sent this unit back."
3,Not so great for me....,"I got this earlier in the year to alleviate neck problems from using my phone at work. I called to find out if it was compatible with my VOIP phone and they said it was. It is absolutely not compatible with the Comdial ConversiIP EP100. This lifter is made for a completely different type of phone. I had to tape the lifter with packing tape just to keep it attached to the phone. While the earpiece is great, the lifter is the real problem. It has lazy days where it just lifts very slowly then it won't lower all the way. I have had problems since day one with the lifter not working well in addition to not fitting well. So, I would be wary. If I could return it I would."
2,Author could have put more research into this book,"The items listed in this book are minimal and are basically the ""more popular"" collectibles of the bunch. A lot of great toys that I once owned as a child were not even in there. I feel that the descriptions could have been better too. Were it not for the pictures one would not even know what to look for in many of the older items. The author seemed in a hurry to get this book published and could have done a lot more research about what is out there. The lack of work that went into this book shows."
5,Carolle Tidoo Elf - I LOVE THESE DOLLS!,"The Carolle dolls are simply adorable! I just love them as does my 18 month old Daughter! Little girls get so many dolls, but this one is great since it's made for the bath tub. My Daughter pretends that she's washing his hair and pours water over him. I like it too since it is a boy doll. Not the same old baby girls. And it does dry fast! And it smells sooooo good as does all of the Carolle dolls! Best baby dolls I've ever seen! Very pretty!"
5,fits in with drowning pool and static-x,"ive recently got a ton of albums and while listening to them 3 stood out. sinner by dp, machine by static-x, and obsolete by ff. as i looked at the tracks EDGECRUSHER caught my eye. i love the remix so i put it on and realized THIS IS THE BEST SONG OF THE CENTURY LIKE NOTHING ANYONES HEARD BEFORE, now the remix soundeds demented. another thing cool about obsolete is if u look in the book, theres a story that includes the songs, for example ""EDGECRUSHER stops in an abandoned building to rest himself. as he falls to sleep on a cold, flat floor, he repeats the ame words that he does every night"" then its the lyrics for descent. buy this cd the songs will grow on you and eat u."
5,Buy Obsolete now.,This Album is awesome. If you like bass you have to hear the song shock! If you like bass and metal you'll love this album. If your into killer remakes buy it for the song cars.
3,Una desilusión,"es un disco poderoso pero le falta ""cuerpo"" , cosa que no ocurre con demanufacture que es muchísimo mejor y mas elaborado en todo aspecto.....pero aún así ""zafa""...la batería ya es una marca registrada de esta banda, por lo característica de su sonido (en especial el doble bombo)...los teclados y efectos intentan magramente darle melodia y el bajo suena mas que en demanufacture, es mas por momentos (solo en ciertos temas) se siente deslizarse sutilmente un sonido ""Korn""...pero muy sutilmente....."
5,The Best So Far,"As an avid fan of techno as well as metal/hardcore, i must say that this album brings the best of both worlds. Intelligent samples, smashing grooves, and punishing lyrics make this album thoroughly enjoyable. The musicianship is top-notch (in comparison to some of today's othe metal acts). The guitarist, while choosing to eschew solos, does a superb job in laying down an unforgettable anthem. The bassist and drummer add the best grooves lines of any hardcore band i have ever heard. Lastly the vocalist tries, and succeeds, in blending an agressive and heavy verse with a startling original and unique chorus. A must have album for any true metal enthusiast."
3,Can be great or boring,"I actually loved the lighter yet powerful songs on this album, but the really heavy stuff is just over the top and gets boring real fast. If Fear Factory want to become a true great band they should focus more on songs like 'descent' which really mix various styles to create something powerful and not stick to the obnoxious, repetitive screaming of songs like 'obsolete' (which is just that). I saw them in concert a couple of weeks ago and they rocked like hell and the concert was just crazy, but that same type of music which sounds great live comes over as dull on disc (the really heavy stuff...)."
2,"Resurrection, plus junk","Now this is a very biased review here (it's really just a review for one song). I'm not into this kind of metal whatsoever, love classic 80's metal (Iron Maiden, etc.) or classic industrial (Ministry, etc.). I think Fear Factory is quite a boring modern metal act. This is standard nu-ish junk metal, but this one song, Resurrection, stands out as an emotional musical masterpiece. I don't know how these guys managed to throw this amazing song into such a mediocre pile, but I recommend anyone to listen to that one song, if it means you have to buy this album or just download the song. Two stars, just for Resurrection."
5,Softening up?,"Figures, the bands fan are turning against them, what a stereotype. Oh well, I still love Fear Factory. They are just as heavy as before, and even more creative, this along with Soul of a New Machine is Fear Factory at it's best. It is a great cd through and through and the extra tracks are a nice little bonus. Best songs: Shock, Edgecrusher, Desecent, 0-0 Where Evil Dwells, Messiah, Resurrection, Hi-Tech Hate, and Smasher Devourer."
5,the songs enhance the short story with raw emotion,"the obsolete cd is an excellent use of songs to dictate the emotion of a short story composed by burton.c.bell. each song is powerful and thought provoking. the pulsating percussion coupled with grooved out bass lines and shredding guitar give this cd all of the power you would ever want. although this cd is power packed with adrenaline on most of it's songs, the song ressurection is surprisingly emotional. the symphonic mellowness coupled with the pain and understanding in burtons lyrics make this a very dramatic song. this one of the best cd's i've heard in a while. favorite tracks are SHOCK, DESCENT, FREEDOM OR FIRE and RESSURECTION."
2,No variation,Miss Smith can sing but the music on this CD is boring. There is no variation in the tracks just the same old same old tunes. I wish this artist could show her range of music by choosing better scores of music to record. Just disappointed in the CD
3,A book for all teens that have been falsely accused of criminal activities,"Francis Kelly, a typical teenager at the wrong place at the wrong time was blamed for a crime he did not commit. Although this kids world was turned upside down, he learns that in life sometimes what appears to be is not always what it seems to be.Adra Young/ArdannylAuthor of: The Everyday Living of Children & Teens Monologues"
4,Impeccable Writing Style,"The structure of this novel and literary devices are incredible. While ""The Pollen Room"" is not heavily dramatic, it speaks in the voice of a generation, similar to ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""Less than Zero."" The despondent tone of the novel while the narrator is trying to become herself and accept her family echoes the lost feelings of many in this age group. While her family runs from responsibility, she tries to run to herself. This novel is an impressive first novel for Jenny, although it lacks the active pace of the novels previously mentioned."
5,"I like Actraiser, a lot.","I've always thought Actraiser was one of the better games released on the SNES. The building portion of the game is a lot like SimCity (if I remember correctly), which I always enjoyed so if you don't like that you might not like this game. The action part was kind of like Castlevania. First you do an action level, then you build, then boss-action, then action, then build, etc. Once you beat it the first time you can play just the action levels again. I thought it was pretty impressive graphically and it had a pretty good soundtrack (especially the second level, Blood Lake or something).I always felt this was a very solid game, and if I weren't so poor I'd probably buy a copy of it to play again."
4,Original fun.,"I enjoyed this game when it was initially released with three other people, they just watched, as if the game was a fantasy movie unfolding. Challenging and satisfyingly graphical for its time, Actraiser is better than its sequel. It is simple fun and diverse, with several levels and great background music. Worth having."
4,Old school classic,"One of the cool things about this game is that you have both action/side-scrolling with killing monsters with your sword, and a Sim City-esque world-building game (six cities total, with two action levels for both) It might not be for everyone, but I have played it several times through, and have genuinely enjoyed it. It also helps to maximize your potential to rack up points in the action parts (not too much to ask for) for a total of at least 25,000 points between the two levels for any one city. It's not overly complicated, and I do wish there had been more cities and stuff, but for a SNES game, this was pretty enjoyable. It's worth a try if you like Sim-style games with action."
1,Spend a little more,"All plastic that won't last. Tells you not to disassemble to clean, which is a mistake, but not a surprise. They don't want you to know how cheaply made it is. Spend $20 more and get something that will last you more than 2-3 uses."
2,Save your money,"Not a good buy. Very hard to get a consistent spray.It took some time to get any mix to come out of the nozzle at all. It would just blow air.I spent more time unclogging it than working.I used the ready mixed bottle of Homax texture first to get a feel for it, then I made my own mix using the hopper that comes with the gun. Patchy finish due to very inconsistent stream of air/compound mix.On the third bedroom ceiling it broke. The rotary nozzle attachment just sheared off when trying to adjust the spray size. Not fixable, so it's toast after one days use.Very much a cheap disposable product."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!,"I bought a Karanga ipod case about a month ago. It looks good in the picture on their website, but when the product arrived it was scratched and dusty and very cheeply made. They don't have any kind of phone number to call either on their website or in the yellow pages (as a matter of fact, the address they give on their website is actually for an auto repair shop in New York). I tried emailing them asking how to return the case and I still haven't heard anything from them (it's been about 2 weeks).Please don't buy anyting from Karanga. They sent me a crappy product that I am now stuck with...they seem to disappear as soon as they get your money."
2,disappointed,"The reviewer Maggie says it all for me. I feel the author did not really show that Jack loved Arabella. I felt let down that JF didn't make Jack stand up more for Arabella than his mistress.I don't think I'll be reading any more of JF books, she does this all the time with her H/H. It was just too much angst and not enough love."
2,UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this for my 5 yr old son and he used it 1 time. He found it hard to keep his balance and kept falling off. One time he almost hit his head on the side of the pool. I think it needs to be made more stabilized so it doesn't tip as easily as it does. I took it away and am bringing it back to toys r us as I feel a child could really get hurt if they lose balance and are near the side of the pool. What is worse is the instructions say to stay in a water depth the depth of your child which means the shallow end which means more turning and more chance of falling off and hitting the side. I think it is very unsafe!!!
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun, Till your daddy takes the bass boat away.","Hiaasen's best fiction. I don't usually enjoy fiction, but the story is vivid and in the realm of the ""incredible but believable."""
3,This did not work on my neighbors psychotic Pit Bull,"My neighbor has 2 dogs that she leaves out in the back yard when she goes to work. One of them, a Pit Bull, has taken it into her head that I must be destroyed every time I make an appearance in my back yard. She can see me and attacks the fence, barking incessantly. I bought the Lentek Bark Free in an attempt to quell the noise, but the device only seemed to make the barking more furious. The problem lies more with the dog than with the device, so I am giving it 3 stars. A new fence is in order instead."
1,Doesn't Work,Bought two of these to help control my dogs barking habits. I have not noticed any kind of change and amm very disappointed. It also took about two weeks to receive in the mail. :(
2,Lentek Bark Free Dog Training Device,I am very dissapointed with it . Sometimes it does nothing and other times we hear it louder than the dog does. Still trying to figure out the correct way for it to work?
2,It only works with audible mode,"It is not what I was expecting.. It only works with the audible mode, I don't know what sound is more annoying.."
1,"Didn't work for dog, caused my roommate considerable pain","The supersonic/regular volume audio tones had no effect what so ever on my Collie/Lab and the supersonic tone was very much audible to my roommate at a certain distance and literally caused him to fall against the wall clutching his head in pain, I don't recommend something this unpredictable to anybody!"
1,Waste of Money,This product is a total waste of money..I tried it both ways ultrasonic and audible..It didnt affect my dogs what so ever i tried it right next to them and farther away they still bark..All that happened was my ears were left ringing when i tired it audible..Do not buy and look for a different brand if u are going to buy ultraonic...
1,Dogs still bark,I have two dogs and they are not big barkers but every so often they have their moments. So I bought this item hoping it would alleviate the barking to some degree but it does not help at all. My son has even tried plugging it in right next to where the dog is barking and it has had no effect whatsoever. It is now back in the box so do not waste your money.
3,Recollection of the engrossing moments,"A must buy for any Truffaut's fans and anyone who has the slightest interest in recreating many of the touching moments in Truffaut's movies. This soundtracks contain lots of classic tunes in 5 Truffaut's movies, not the least from the beginning of Shooting the Pianist with simplicity (e.g. Charlie), to the merry-go-around sound in A Beautiful Woman Like Me, to the powerful, love-indulging emotional Mississipi Mermaid, to the suspenseful Vivement Diamnche! George Delerue and others add all the unspeakable feelings and emotions to Truffaut's great films. There is no music score from Jules et Jim though, which would have been more perfect in this collection, if it is included as well."
1,Collimating problem,"This pair seemed great when it arrived. I had read some reviews about how Nikons arrived and weren't collimated. Mine were, so I was relieved. They arrived late November. They were even in good sharp focus last Thursday, but today, 3 days after the warranty is up, they are no longer collimated. I didn't drop them or treat them any differently during the last few days. Now I will find out about Amazon, and how they back up their sales. That was another area of concern I had from reviews when I bought. But the price lured me to take a chance. Anybody got contact info for Amazon customer complaints? Scrolling to the bottom of the site, I don't see contact info for complaints."
1,Deceptive Size,"These won't even begin to fit 8.5"" x 11"" products. We're trying to ship books, and we got these, thinking they'd be perfect. However, these wouldn't even fit the cover. The opening isn't a full 8 inches. Also, they're paper thin, and the bubble filling is negligible."
3,great service but envelopes ripped in transit,"I ordered 400 9.5 x 14 envelopes and they arrived on my doorstep in no time at all, in 4 large boxes. The envelopes were in great condition. I had to mail a 6x9 paperback book along with a 20-page 8.5x11 catalog and the envelopes were ideal for that. For several recipients, I wanted to send two copies of the book, and while they just fit into the envelope, the bubble liner is thin so I had my doubts. I mailed two of the packets to myself, one with one book and catalog and one with two books and catalog, and the one with two books arrived with a large tear in the bottom. That being said, I knew I had pushed the limits of reasonable contents. All in all, great product and great service. UPDATE: SEVERAL RECIPIENTS REPORTED LARGE TEARS IN THE BOTTOM SEAM OF THE ENVELOPES, AND MANY OF THE PAPERBACK BOOKS WERE LOST. THIS INCLUDED THE LIGHTER-WEIGHT CONTENTS. I AM NOT LIKELY TO USE THESE AGAIN FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE LIGHTEST OF CONTENTS."
4,AWESOME PRICE,The envelopes are worth the money. They feel like recycled paper so not for extreme heavy items but for the price a great bargain.I've used several & I will definitely buy them again.
4,"Rather boxy, but sturdy.","I thought the bag would be more of a backback style, but it was very much the traditional rectangular box with handle & shoulder strap.Nevertheless, it's quite functional: sturdy, well-padded, with Velcro dividers to allow for flexibility.Enough room for the D50 w/lens, longer lens, flash, charger. Plenty of pockets for filters, spare batteries, manuals, etc."
3,its not bad but i expected more,"I bought this bag for my Nikon D80 from Cameta Camera, i read the reviews and decided to bought it despite some bad coments. The bag is slightly different from the one in the picture, its more square. Like some other costumers have said, it comes with 4 buckles and personally i would prefer if it came with a zipper instead and maybe only 2 of the four buckles.Its a good bag for the price, it looks genuine (i read somewhere that the Nikon tag seemed fake, not mine) it has plenty of room. Im still not sure if its good enough to carry everywhere with me..If you want a better bag you will have to pay more than 28$"
4,Nifty Gadget Bag,I recently purchased a Nikon D60 camera and was seeking a gadget bag. I found this one at Amazon and purchased it. The design and construction of the bag was simple yet functional and the quality was very good. I am very pleased with the value received on this purchase.
1,shipping & Handling,"The product description had the charger in the package. But not shipped. I could not find a spare to buy for this item(may be stopped production), i had no option than return it back.Neither opened the cover nor used the camera. so i could't grade the product. but i can grade your shipping and handling to (-)5 out of 5 that is{minus five out of a plus five). Please note that there is no negative stars in your rating system. we need them for future use.Bha. Su."
1,sucks!,This item didn't even fit my car.. it said it would.fit but when I got it and tried to install it . It didn't .it fit and it sounds like. Crap!! Don't buy this piece of crap .
1,not satisfied,"I ordered books on 7/27. When they did not arrive by 8/20 I notified the company and was told they had lost my order due to a computer breakdown. My order was due to be sent out that day. Now, 9/8, I still have no books and I am again told they will ship my books today!. I should have received express, overnight delivery the first time the error was discovered. No recompense was offered, no special delivery arranged. This is not good customer service. ""I'm sorry"" doesn't cover the inconvenience. I can't speak to the condition of the product. I don't have the books yet!"
4,"Pretty Good game,GB Version Slightly Better","Personally,gambling games are'nt my forte,but given how much i enjoyed the GB version(which i purchased n summer 96)i was clearly gonna get the SNES version 1 day.Although fun n it's own right the SNES version does'nt have the boxing and horse gambling options found in it's GB brethern or the cool ending scene/music.Nevertheless i found a new one on amazon.com 4 under $10 n 2010.SNES fans get this game before the sellers start jacking up the prices like most popular SNES games."
3,"Good item, little overpriced","I think I could have gotten these cheaper at an Auto Store but they looked like the ones I wanted so I got them here. Like other reviewers have said, the safety cover is not metal, but painted plastic. And if you look at the images I uploaded, you can see that it's not even completely done! Not a huge deal but just keep that in mind. Very simple to install though, just drill a 1/2"" hole in your dash or wherever you want to install it. Then it just pops on there with a nut and washer. I got a blue and red one and they look good together I think. Going to wire one up to underbody and the other to some gauges and stuff. Check out my picture if you'd like."
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"This review is for the Taylor 5995 Professional Oven Thermometer. After just 2 months, it has completely stopped working. I cannot recommend."
4,"nice story, but somewhat distracting presentation","The story itself was cute. (Please note that parents and teachers who disapprove of naughty or ""fresh"" behavior in books may not be a fan of the tricks the animals play on the farmer.). For me, the design of the book, with words cascading across the page, sentences seemingly hidden behind colorful artwork, etc., took away from the story itself. The bright pictures might be quite appealing to younger (i.e. Toddlers) though."
3,Interesting information. Did not work for me.,"This book has a lot of interesting information, but the only book that worked for me was Sleep Sense, which I purchased this book online.Now, my baby girl is sleeping for 12 hours straight through the night. Ahhh!!"
3,Good for stay at home parents,"I felt this book was good but only for a certain parenting style. It advocated co-sleeping and staying with your baby while they fall asleep. If you are a stay at home parent and have the time, this is a gentle way to guide your baby to sleep. But as in my case I have twins and didn't want to co-sleep. For me the tips in the book were too time consuming, high maintence and demanding.It wasn't helpful for me (even though I tried it out of desperation and with no success) but for some with more time and dedication, it could work."
3,Good theories just didn't work for me,This was a good book and i liked the methods she used however it just didn't necesarily work for our particular situation.
1,better if you have a newborn,My son is 9 months old and I started all his bad habits. I have tried everything in this book. It has made my nights sleep worse. This book is better off if you have a newborn.
1,Painful.,"The advice given in this book is redundant to many other books out there. My 7 month old would laugh at this author if she could read. I gave it one star because this book caused me to try out an earlier bed time and that helped a little. Don't waste your money, just develop a routine and stick with it."
3,Overated,"I just finished reading this book. It has so much fluff in it that the total advice content could easily fit in a pamphlet. If you know NOTHING about babies, sure get this book. But if you already know that putting a baby face down on a fluffy blanket is not a good idea, this book is not really for you. Most of the book is telling you about how others have had this or that problem. Not how they solved it, just that it happened. It's supposed to make you feel like you are not alone. The only thing I found that was actual advice was a small list of five or so items that consisted of items like, Keep it dark and quiet. WOW. I never thought of that. There was, do not create a suck to sleep association. That is useful for some. The rest are cliches or little sayings."
3,Didn't work for me,Dr Pantley's method didn't work for my 4 month-old. Her whole idea is crying is bad. I tried her methods for 3 weeks but I think picking up the baby when she cries simply teaches her that crying gets her what she wants. I was too tired and my neck was killing me. I switched to Dr Feber methods and it worked wonderfully. I had to contend with cying for the first 2 days but that was it!! now she sleeps much easier.
1,Not an appropriate choice for AP parents,"This book will be helpful to parents who can tolerate small bits of the ""cry-it-out method"" (Pantley offers a modified cry-it-out method), but it's not suitable for AP parents who believe that they need to respond to their babies' needs day or night. Nighttime Parenting by Dr. Sears offers a much more baby-friendly and parent-friendly program."
3,"Probably good, but not for my child","This was an easy read, although perhaps a bit lengthy on the stories for the parent who has very little time because their child never sleeps! The principals are good, this was my first choice and first read, (of many,) baby sleep books. I was already following most of no-cry sleep solutions that I could before I even read the book, and was getting no results. Also, I think the results are meant to be achieved over a very long period, eg many months. I was (and still am unfortunately) looking for much quicker results! I enjoyed that the author focused on breastfeeding mothers (me) and bedsharing, but if you don't do either of those, I feel like there may be fewer suggestions for you, and lots of information to skip over! All and all, I'm sure it's great for some babies' sleep problems, but not mine; a good first read if you're very hesitant to try any ""cry-it-out"" methods."
2,Didn't work for me.,"This book had a lot of good ideas. They simply did not work for me. My son did not want to sleep unless he was being held. I ended up doing a modified Ferber: we let him cry for one minute at a time. It took two weeks, and now I have a baby who goes down to sleep smiling at seven pm, and wakes up smiling and happy at six am.Try this book first, but if it doesn't work, don't blame yourself. Every baby is different."
2,Ugh.,"When we were having issues with our son sleeping and every pediatrician told us it was behavioral, we bought this book. Nothing worked with him. Absolutely nothing! Well, this book was a big waste of money because our son ended up having his adenoids out which solved everything.Before you waste your money on this book until you've explored every possible option for why your child is not sleeping. There are plenty of websites out there that can assist you."
2,A Little Much,"I believe that most parenting styles are ""good"" parenting styles, but this book is a better ""solution"" for those who are more into coddling their child than I am. I found her techniques to be completely overwhelming for a Mom who loves her child, but who needs a moment or two to herself in order to stay sane."
2,Buy Paperback Book NOT Kindle!,"Being a cheapskate who wanted the book fast and cheap, I downloaded it on my husband's kindle. Stupid mistake. Reading fiction on a kindle is one thing, but Pantley has reproducible charts and forms in her book and there are multiple places where you are told to skip ahead to a certain page depending on which circumstances best describe your child. Admittedly, I'm seriously sleep-deprived, so maybe my grasp of technology isn't at its best right now and there might be ways to make the Kindle more functional, but for a book like this, I'm wishing I had paperback. That way, I could more easily review certain tips or skim content or flip to a page she references. The book itself is great and has been very helpful, I just recommend not getting this kind of book in Kindle format."
4,Helpful Guide,"My daughter doesn't have near the sleep problems as this author, but I still found this book helpful. I was reassured that I am already doing many of her suggestions, and I was introduced to some interesting new ones."
4,No more crying it out....,"I just couldn't bring myself to allow my baby to ""cry it out"", it just seems inhumane. This book helped solve the problem. Filled with great ideas, insight, solutions, and other mothers stories I put it to good use. My baby's sleep improved dramatically!Only 4 stars because the only part that I didn't find necessary was keeping an on-going sleep log. I was much to tired for that and judged the success of the program on continuing improvements.Highly recommended for other mothers that just cannot allow their baby to cry it out!"
2,Not worth the money,"The whole point of this book is try and make parents feel guilty for even considering to let their infant cry it out. It however does have one or two good suggestions that when used with Weissbluth's method are effective. Overall though the Weissbluth book is definately a much more worthwhile read,even if you don't believe in letting the child cry it out."
3,Some good tips but overall didn't work for me,I really delved into this book hoping this would be the solution for my baby. I think perhaps if I had gotten my hands on it when my baby was younger I would have had more success. My baby is four months and just won't go to sleep on her own no matter what I tried. She was still crying every night and inevitably I still ended up rocking her back to sleep. On the upside this book has helped me establish a more consistent routine which I think really works for my baby. Now if only I could get some help on how to get baby to sleep without crying...
3,"Probably a good system, but it backfired on us.","Pantley's No Cry Solution is a great idea, but you'll need patience. Our three month old WAS sleeping through the night but had to nurse to sleep. I bought the book as it advertised a solution for getting baby to sleep without nursing-it backfired on us! Within a week for trying her solution, our baby started to wake again, every few hours. I continued the ""solution"", now implementing the additional steps to get baby to sleep through the night and it just got worse and worse. We went from baby sleeping 9-10 hours solid, in his own bed, to now him co-sleeping with us, waking about every two hours. If your baby is already sleeping through the night, just having to nurse to initialing fall asleep, be careful. I now wish I had just dealt with being the only one who could put him to sleep and waited until I stopped breastfeeding. Five month later, I'm still the only one who can put him to sleep and he no longer sleeps through the night."
3,The kindle edition poor quality,"I'm happy with the book, it is so far the best in what I had read on sleep methods for parents, but I am not happy with the quality of the kindle edition, it is full of typos, I guess the text had been scanned and put through text-recognition software, that's how they make those free e-books... But I have paid my ten bucks, and I expect certain quality level, I'm sure those who have purchased the printed version can enjoy the typo-free text. Don't kindle readers deserve a quality edition?"
3,Thank You Elizabeth Pantley!!!,It is suppose to be 5 ***** STARS above!!!!I love this book and would deeply recommend it to other new parents. Pantley values and respects children. I found her ideas and suggestions very helpful in getting my little 8 month old baby to sleep.
2,"Dr. Harvey Karp's ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" is Faster/Better","I have been through all of these challenges. Dr. Karp's ""The Happiest Baby on the BLock"" is also a no cry sleep solution, but he has been doing these technigues, the 5S's as a pediatrician for over 30 years. Let that speak for itself. Why reinvent the wheel? He teaches on how to teach the child to sleep and how to wein them from the assistance. I had a colicy baby (extreme was the diagnosis), and the only thing that worked IMMEDIATELY was the 5 S's by Dr. Karp. I cannot imagine how well it would have worked for a baby that did not have colic (ah but a faint dream). I would not waste my time with all these other things. I recommend the DVD for quick tools to learn, but get the book so you can get more understanding into why it works (after you get some sleep that I guarantee you will get)"
2,Bad if you have ideas on what to do,"This book was helpful in the sense that 1) our child is only 2 months old, 2) we hadn't started sleep training at all, and threfore had no ideas, and 3) with 2 stay at home parents, we were not sleep deprived. It gave some good ideas for us to keep in the back of our minds when we get into sleep training her. However, if you rely on this book 100% with the tecnhiques on a child that is ready for sleep training, all you're going to train them to do is sleep only when in your arms. I would never be cold or callous to any child, but if I ran to my infant at the first sound when she slept, I'd never leave the side of her crib.as a brand new parent, there are some good ideas, so it isn't totally useless, but if I had more experience in the sleep training department, the book would have been useless."
1,Pantley's book is a pantload,"My 12 month old son cried hysterically for over 1 1/2 hours when I attempted Pantley's method. It was a horrible ordeal for both of us. After realizing that there is no such thing as a ""no cry"" solution, I looked elsewhere and found myself reading the revised version Ferber's book. Up to that point, I had been adamantly opposed to allowing my son to cry it out as I though it was barbaric. Turns out my understanding of Ferber's method was incorrect. We are on day three of ""Ferberization"" and it is going well. Sure, it is hard to listen to my little guy cry but as his mom I must do what is best for him. I recommend saving your $$$ on this book and buying the Ferber book. It is a fabulous, informative, and easy read."
1,Looking to be judged?,"It appears that if you do not follow this book's advice, along with its other examples of parenting (some call it attachment parenting), then you are a horrid heathen of a parent.I was looking for another book to put in my arsenal of combating sleep problems before they occur. I have read Healthy Sleep Habits, Healthy Child and took away many things that have helped my 4 month old sleep 10+ hours each night. It was straightforward and clear.The No Cry book just told me that I was horrid if my baby cried, s/he would grow up to be non-trusting, full of hatred for the human race and unable to connect on a decent level with other human beings.I don't think so. I say pass on this book unless you subscribe to each of the author's opinion on what is best for your child."
3,some basic good advise,"This book has some good advises, it is an easy read but a bit lacking in content side.My solution to baby sleeping problem is to read more books, since not one book will fit your baby perfectly, I owned six baby sleeping book and find myself applying techniques from different books at different situation.If I have to choose just two books, this will be my # 2 choice, the top choice will go to Tracy Hogg -- Secret of the baby whisperers."
3,Many good ideas,"At age five months, my son would only sleep after nursing for 1-3 hours or while latched on. He was cranky with intermittent crying all day from not getting good rest. With no sleep myself, I couldn't bear to wait-it-out or to cry-it-out either. I read every sleep book. I liked some of the ideas in no-cry sleep solution and it would probably work given several weeks. I liked the Baby Whisperer techniques better for two reasons. One, they worked for us in only three nights to get great sleep. Two, the Baby Whisperer book teaches you to listen to and interpret what your baby is telling you with different cries - not just ignore a cry (cry it out) or try to silence it (no cry)."
2,Not for everyone,"The ideas in this book make sense, but the author claims that it will work for everyone. This could not be more true. After a month of my baby waking up every hour or so, I gave up on this method. The first night off of this method he slept for 8 hours straight. Sometimes nursing or rocking your baby to sleep is best way for a baby to fall asleep. Not every method can work for every mom and baby."
4,Necessary Conversation,"I.R.King's Journal of a Superfluos Woman, is an interesting account of a part of one woman's journey along the curve of personal politics and societal history spanning the second half of the momentuous twentieth century. While many of the issues that the writer focuses echo universal themes, with its background of Caribbean reality, she brings additional voice to the necessary reasoning about class, race, gender, and intra-gender relationships often missing from 'polite conversations' among the more comfortable of Caribbean society. King's style is very readable, even humorous in parts, but that should not cause the reader to underestimating the import of this journal."
5,Great Book,"Great book. It provided everything we needed to put together a comprehensive, balanced plan for growth. I highly recommend this book toeveryone!"
5,Loved it so much I had to buy it!,"I first saw this book in the library, but once I checked it out, brought it home, and got a good look at it, I knew I had to buy it for myself. The artwork makes it look like a ""lightweight"", but don't be decieved! Among the cute drawings and clever musings is some good, hard info about New Orleans and the surrounding area. I have already bought a second one as a gift, and I recommend it highly."
2,Pretend that is medical textbook instead of massage book.,"Content of this book is divided so that techniques of massage start half way through, and seem more complicated than needed.The first 1/3rd of content is dedicated to chinese anatomy and various illnesses which is waste of pages. Truly disappointing.It is hard to learn from it."
4,DVD NOW AVAILABLE IN USA!!,"Heads up to all Clark Gable/Grace Kelly/Ava Gardner/John Ford fans!!MOGAMBO is now available on DVD exclusively in Target Stores (not available online)- just was browsing this week's ad (12/18-12/24/2005) and nearly fell off my chair to see it advertised as a ""Target Exclusive"" for only $9.99!! What a great holiday surprise! (Target is also exclusive carrier of Ford's 3 GODFATHERS) - Hope the DVD gets wider distribution after the '05 holidays but I know where I'm going tonight with 10 bucks! Hope this was happy holiday news to you all!"
5,Great classic detective stories,This collection of Thinking Machine stories is the classic American analog to Sherlock Holmes. The author develops the logical detective model and these stories are a must-read for all true lovers of the mystery genre. The author died on the Titanic.
5,Works great,Nice thermometer for a decent price. The dial is easy to read and has been accurate so far. I would definitely recommend this product.
4,Adequate,"Received in new condition and appears to function accurately, although I have not independently verified its calibration, other than the steamed milk seems to be the correct temperature."
5,Perfect Cappuccino Every Time,"I'm a fan of instant thermometers, I use them for cooking and frothing milk. This one is easy to read and works well."
2,"worked good for a while, then it died","after three months of use, it stopped registering tempurature. while it worked, though, it was a ""must-have"" for excellant froth. I would recommend getting *a* thermometer, not necessarily this one (unless mine was a dud)"
5,"Easy to use, great for frothing milk","Dial is easy to read, clips easily onto both of my stainless steel frothing pitchers. Would recommend"
1,"This ""frothing"" thermometer is useless without the proper frothing temperature range!","How can a thermometer labeled specifically for frothing not include the critical 80-100 degree range?? I wish I had been more careful before buying this since I simply cannot use it without knowing that vital 80-100 degree range, but who would have thought a thermometer marketed toward one specific purpose would not include the ability to use it for said purpose?"
2,The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,"It's Paul Kennedy, who bravely predicted the decline of American power back in 1989. It would be replaced by a multi polar world split between Europe, China, Japan and the USSR. Oh, yeah. He missed the real decline and fall of a superpower- that of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Not too great a sin, almost everyone else did also. But when you are in the prediction business, expect some laughs at your expense when you are wrong. Ha ha.This book is more of the same. Beautifully researched, wonderfully written, and completely wrong."
2,Weights and measures in recipes,"This book looked good but unfortunately the weights and measures in the recipes render the book next to useless if you live in Europe. You can find out how much a cup weighs but the precise weight depends on the type of flour you're using -- for example typo 00 is finer than standard flour etc. Also the author refers to cakes of yeast -- is this a 0.6 g cake or a 2.0 g cake that US bakers use? In addition, when the author talks about flour she tells us that typo 00 is the correct type to use but she then lists two other types of flour (cake flour plus one other) in her standard dough recipe. I understand that the author is attempting to approximate typo 00 which may be hard to find but she should still have given the correct typo 00 weight for those who can get it. The book is well presented and is nice to look at but the recipes are flawed for the reasons mentioned."
1,very poor product,"I bought this as a replacement for an old, ...meat thermometer I had (it finally broke) that had worked for years. This one did not work at all - first it registered a very high temp too early, then when I removed it and re-inserted it, it did not register at all. I threw it away!"
1,Doesn't Work,"This thermometer never worked. I bought it new several years ago and have tried it twice. Both times it registered too low a temperature. The last time it failed to register above 145 degrees on a pork roast which I ruined by overcooking by twice the recommended cook time, waiting in vain for the thermometer to reach 170 degrees."
4,the wig is a bit small for adults,I like the wig but it is a bit small for adults. I was disappointed to see that it wasn't as long as in the pic displayed.
2,Nice ME little book,"Good if you like Tea.Little too small, and not enough illustrations for me.Low on the list of my favorite ME books."
5,Great Hand Mixer,"I shopped for this mixer in retail stores near me. The price offered by Amazon beat the price of the KitchenAid KHM900ER 9-Speed Hand-Mixer, Empire Red in every store. For many years, I had a Kitchen Aid Hand Mixer which I really liked, but I stripped the gears by going from Low to High without stopping between speeds. The digital speed control on this mixer makes it impossible to do this. The mixer is sturdy and strong for most tasks except extreemly stiff dough. For that you need to use the Kitchen Aid Stand mixer. I would highly recommend this mixer to anyone."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"This mixer is a dream come true for me. I've suffered with an old 3-speed mixer for 25 years and finally got fed up. Since I don't have room for a stand up mixer, this is the next best thing. Easy to use, quiet with great non-clog beaters. Mixing cookie dough couldn't be easier. By purchasing the one with the red trim, I saved a bundle too. I highly recommend this mixer!"
4,Ska with soul!,"As you may or may not know, ska has been flooding the music industry lately, and it seems like one ska band after the other is being thrown at us. But once in a while a band comes out that is worth our time. One of these bands is Spring Heeled Jack, and Songs From Suburbia is the reason why. What makes this band different is the talent, and the gimmick-free music which is especially lacking in a lot of new wave ska bands. The singing and songwriting is amazing, and the horns are good too. Buy this one."
4,A decent book with a few problems...,"This book is really for the developer interested in Satellite Forms or Metroworks. The Pendragon section is minimal at best and the CSPad is even less. As a potential Satellite Forms developer, I used this to evaluate the product. Unfortunately, the Trial Edition of Satellite Forms is v 2.02 and the sample code on the CD is written with a more recent version and is therefore impossible to open. Satellite Forms is currently at 3.1 - 3.5 so they're delivering a significantly older version. The upside of this is that Satellite Forms TE 2.02 allows saving of projects, something that the current TE does not. The Metroworks section is very light and significantly under emphasizes both the power and complexity that this tool wields. Conclusion...a fair book that exposes some things very well (a great reference on Satellite Forms, esp. their ActiveX conduit) but leaves a lot of things left out."
3,24 hours? Depends on what you intend to do.,"I bought and read this book in 24 hours. It falls short of teaching the reader how to program well in 24 hours. It's failing is that it goes over too many tools with broad sweeping generality. There are 4 tools discussed in the book. This is a good intro to Palm OS and how to write code for it in general.The real title of the book should have been ""Getting Started with Palm Development"".Unfortunately, the tools, especially the most useful one - CodeWarrior - are complicated with many details that are left out in the book. Each chapter talks about ""how to's"" with broad generality and doesn't give recipe examples.Could you program in 24 hours? Yes, but not very sophisticated code. The book is worth buying and reading but it falls short on the 24 hour promise. Other SAMs 24 hour/ 30 day books stick to the promise much better.Look at the codewarrior documentation. It consists of several books. How can you compress that into 24 hours and three 20 page chapters?"
1,WCW Bash at the Beach 1999,"The worst pay-per-view of all time. This event really sucked, if you watch you will go to sleep. The main event was Sting & Kevin Nash vs. Randy Savage & Sid Vicious. The match was slow and boring and the undercard completely sucked. Don't buy this video it is a waste of money. Don't even rent this video you will stop it halfway through probably."
5,Tried many thermometers,I like this one the best of all the refrigerator thermometers I've tried. This shows a temperature range and it's easy to read. Highly recommend it.
4,A must have,"For anyone given to making simple or even complicated repairs, or routine maintenance work, this book is a must have. Well documented, well pictured and well written. It's as good as it gets short of the factory manuals which are not usually available in printed form, at reasonable cost to retail customers."
4,Comprehensive & some expertise required,"This manual is by far the best manual for the e36. That being said it is by no way the definitive bible on these cars. While you won't find another manual that covers as many topics in so much detail, there are some omissions and admittedly so by the publisher - apparently some of the procedures left out (like work to the bottom end of the engine) are too expensive to cover, considering the small number of people who request them. All in all however, even a complete novice grease monkey (like myself) can perform most if not all of the tasks outlined. A veteran enthusiast therefore will find this manual even more helpful.One gripe I do have is that some of the diagrams and photos could be a bit clearer but no one should be scared away by this little point. The tasks outlined are definitely achievable with the instructions provided. just read over everything before you begin - like the manual states!"
1,not happy,"very, very slow. Sent me a defective item. I returned the item only to receive another defective item a month later."
5,Julienne Peeler,Excellent quality and very sharp. Worth the few extra dollars compared to less expensive ones. The cadillac of julienne peelers. Love it!
5,durable,great little toy!it's durable and easy to use! recommend it over the cheaper model.you get what you pay for in this case.
5,GRIPPING AND MOVING PAGE TURNER,"This is a well-documented, gripping history that reads like a novel. In addition to exposing Vichy's complicity with the Germans during the occupation and the disgraceful beginnings of the cold war, Robbins' meticulously researched biography of Michel Thomas, whose existence during the Holocaust is distinguished by ingenious acts of courage, takes you inside the life of a singuarly brave man. This is not just another diary of surivival. In clear, unadorned prose Robbins has drawn the anatomy of triumph. In addition to being a well-written, intelligent book, Test of Courage is a deeply moving page turner"
3,Dictionary,A good dictionary. Most of the words in it are English though. It is like an English dictionary with some Africaans interspersed throughout. I was hoping for a dictionary completely in Africaans.
2,Not happenin,"Ok let's be honest about these... No way in all of hell are you going to climb something with these. They look cool, the metal's very sturdy, the spikes are relatively sharp and could be sharpened more... The foot spikes may work if there was a better way to strap them to your feet, but the hand claws would crush your hand bones under your own weight, no way someone's going to climb with these. Better off with your bare hands."
3,ok Herculies is a little non interactive,This movie was ok if you like a plot line that is not deep. I dont really think the scene changes work. Some of the characters are not developed. this story does not stand alone. If you were not familiar with many stories of herculies than this would not only seem undeveloped but incomplete.
4,This one's scary as hell at some points!!,"In ""Super Castlevania IV"" there are a couple levels that kinda' freaked me out. The first one is the ballroom because the place keeps flashing and you can't even see what's attacking you sometimes. Next is the library level because you have to fight some creepy Knight-like statue that just jumps out at you. Finally, there is the Final-stage which is where you must defeat Dracula. It's all dark and is un-predictable on where he'll come out and attack. When you beat him the first time, his final form totally looks freaky! OVERALL: It's a tight game ven though its oldschool SNES. Play it at night--IF YOU DARE!"
2,castlevania4stinks!,"castlevania4 has good boss's, but the games so hard it's kinda boring. too many things always jumping out at you.But if you have a gameboy,get castlevania for it."
5,The best IMO,"What can be said at this point? out of all the side scrolling Castlevanias this is BY FAR the best in my opinion. 12 levels with amazing graphics, a spectacular musical score, and the must fluid gameplay (8-direction whipping!) the series has ever had. Everybody says Castlevania III is the best one, and I cant argue is one of THE best ones, but I think part IV really takes it. Do yourself a favor and play this fantastic game! you wont regret it!"
1,O for 2,"I'm on my second unit, both have died from the same disease: liquid separation such that the gauge is useless. The first unit died after a couple of years, and even though there's a lifetime warranty it wasn't worth my time to box up, drive to the post office, and spend $5 to replace an $11 item, so I just ordered another one.Which lasted 4 hours.I'll return it and try a dial type."
2,Twice unhappy,"I bought this a while back, and the mercury inside separated, so I called the company and they sent me a new one, and the same thing happened. Plus the temperature markings get easily erased.No likey"
1,Miserably inaccurate,"I just received one of these. Being a suspicious sort of person, I checked it against my professional digital instant-read thermometer. When the true temperature was 275, the Taylor thermometer read 300. When the true temperature was 115, the Taylor read 130. So the Taylor was neither absolutely accurate not linear."
4,"Best I've Used, but Faded Markings Will Happen on Cleaning","Easiest to use/read and most accurate oven thermometer that I've used (out of five different models). The warnings about the markings coming off with heavy cleaning are true, and I've had to buy replacements due to this. That stated, I've chosen to buy another of these instead of go back to one of the less preferred ones I have in my drawer. The only solution I've come up with is to try to keep it clean with regular gentle washings with a soapy sponge, thus avoiding the need for heavy cleaning."
2,ALWAYS STOPS WORKING,I have had several of these and they always stop working properly. Too bad someone doesn't come up with an oven thermometer that lasts.
2,"Generic, and more mellow, but no longer nu-metal (mostly)","This CD is more of the same from the band. Disturbed tried, but this just isn't an album that is anything special, or even good. Disturbed was always a band that had a few songs here and there that you could dig and get into. They seem to have lost that aspect here. Most of the music comes off as generic (Stricken), dull (Guarded), Just plain bad (I'm alive), Or all three (Land of Confusion). As time goes on, and the band progresses, I like them less and less. At least it isn't as big of a disappointment as how SOAD has turned out."
2,Disturbed's Downfall,"I love Disturbed and their music up until ""10000 Fists."" Unfortunatley this album is no where near the status of their 2 previous releases. Maybe it's the new bassist or maybe Disturbed have just run their course, but this is not a solid Disturbed album by any means. There is alot missing and I really hope they can follow this up with an album like ""Believe"" or even ""The Sickness."" Sadly, 10000 Fists led me away from Disturbed and they've fallen big time on my list. This album is not entirely bad, just dissapointing for a Disturbed fan. The hit ""Stricken"" is awsome as well as ""Just Stop"", but other than that, save your money."
2,"""Shut up and sing""","I have to say that I think this is a great sounding CD, however, I could do without the anti-war bias. I know many people won't agree, it doesn't matter, this is my review. I am tired of hollywood, the media, and also musicians, harping on what they think our foreign policy should be. Fall in with the appeasers if you want, but keep your opinions to yourself. Had I'd known this about this release I wouldn't have purchased it. I'd rather be a safe hawk than a dead dove. This pertains to only a couple tracks by the way, not all of the CD. If politics doesn't matter to you, then buy the CD, as I stated before, it really is great sounding."
4,"not as good as the sickness, but better than the last...","disturbed have definately matured since their first album, but this isn't neccasarily a good thing, their first album was much more ""raw"" and catchy. ten thousand fists (what a horrible name) is much better than i expected. the first single is a great song that will stick in your head for days (stricken).There really aren't any filler tracks on this album either which is another plus. if you liked the last disturbed album you'll probably love this one. its really just a perfection of believe, and well done at that. and to address Raisedonspitalfield's review comparing disturbed to underoath... wtf? you have it backwards its not 90% screaming, its 90% singing. i just thought everyone should know this, because his review was extremely misleading."
