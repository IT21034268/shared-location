2,"silly, patronizing, hardly qualifies as journalism...","I was eager to see what Wilmut thought about cloning after reading his excellent essay in the best-selling anthology The Human Cloning Debate. But I was stunned when I read this book. Unlike the other work, this book comes across as silly, even patronizing. The book reads as though Wilmut is attempting to capitalize on Dolly, rather than as a thoughtful reflection on veterinary biology or genetics or human families. It is also very boring, even with the ghostwriter! Save your money; this expensive vehicle is not the best or the most interesting of the crop of cloned cloning books."
5,New favorite,"I was a little ambivalent when I saw previews for this show before it aired. Within a few episodes, it proved itself worthy, surpassing 30 rock and even The Office, in my Opinion. If you're a fan of Arrested Development, the absurdity of this show may appeal to you.In a nutshell, Community continues to amaze me all the time. Sure, there are a few episodes that aren't as good as others, but they keep raising the bar for themselves, so that's bound to happen. This is easily the best comedy I've seen (second only to the Office or Arrested Development). It is well written, witty, and culturally relevant. The characters get crazy at times, but you will learn to love the chaos. I have laughed so hard we had to pause and replay scenes over and over. It's just to rave over.My older brother was ambivalent about the show, but I got him hooked. Everyone I know who has seen it loves it. I really hope NBC doesn't cancel..."
5,What to do when the snow's too deep to chase grasshoppers,"Our cat is stuck inside most of the winter since she dislikes snow. Ruby gets grouchy and gains weight. But now that we have the laser thingie, she races up and down the hallway, scrambles high speed in circles that make her roll over with dizziness, then gets up to leap at the walls. She is so into this toy that she bugs us each night to play with her."
1,Performed WAY Below Expectations / Cheaply Made / Shoddy,"I would have returned this item if I had known there was a set window to do so...I'm not a seasoned Amazon-er..... The battery would not stay in securely, not all of the options for the laser light to go through (molds?...I don't know what to call that) worked...the distance for the light to be seen was less than six feet(I think I'm being generous on saying it was visible at six)....anything further the image spread out and got lighter the further away. The light was intermittent. My cat could only see it if I chose the more concise ""mold"" & if I were about two feet to the surface I was displaying it... It was not fun for me & the cat was disinterested. Don't waste your money."
3,nice but not for mine,The product was well made good price only thing is you have to keep your finger on the button.My cat disnt make a move though on any of the different images. he might come around though who knows
1,Batteries DOA,"Used it for ten seconds, got the cats excited, and the batteries died. I was really disappointed but I should have know better for the price. It sits in a drawer."
1,Should Have listened to the others...,"This is my first review ever, and let me say that it took quite a disappointment for me to finally speak up. Well the price was right and it had around 4 stars for the reviews, but this is one time we didn't luck out. We read the reviews, the good and bad, and figured that the good seemed to outweigh the bad. It's that cheap button that others complain about, couldn't even manage to get the laser light to work for one second."
5,Fat boy loves it,I got this for a stocking stuffer for my wife and her and our cat have a ball with it.
2,No so happy,"These songs aren't sung by the original artist. While SOME are OK, most are just adequate. Not worth the hassle of return but I certainly would not have purchased it had I know. Save your cash."
3,"Well polished, weaker than before in the fundamentals.","This is the long awaited pseudo-sequel to Vampire the Masquerade. Unfortunately, this game suffers from some of the same problems as Wraith, Changeling and other late WW titles: too steep a learning curve, too many 'kewl' characters and too few believable or dramaticly interesting characters, and a new millenial story arc that they shouldn't deliver on. Frankly, WW's decision to play it safe and not leave the formula which every World of Darkness game and Trinity follow is more the disappointment than this well written, but underwhelming revision. Overall, I'd highly recommend Vampire as a system, but other products, like now-obsolete Vampire 2nd or the absolutely fantastic Vampire:Dark Ages are better bets. Don't let this review deter you if you haven't played a White Wolf game- it is truly a fine product, but far less than what they have delivered in the past."
4,Could be better still.,"Since I never used the original edition I can't compare this one to say whether it was an improvement or not. While the basics are all here, it would be nice to have a stronger index. Also the descriptions of how to use the dice, when and why, is confusing. Charts would be better than paragraphs to explain all of this I think. The art work is cool and the little mini-stories are a nice touch. It leaves some unanswered questions but perhaps the sysem is expanding more organically so the makers don't know all the answers -- the clan books suggest this as well as new abilities and disciplines and rules are created."
4,Still waiting...,I still have not received this after over a month; I only gave it a good review score because I have read/played this book/game before and it is really good.
5,A marvelous page-turner,"Ken Sheldon has produced what so many readers want and often don't find. An intelligent, well-written book that is also a page-turner. The situation and characters grip from the beginning, thrusting the reader into a transfixed feeling of 'This could be me.' And when entering the astonishing concluding scene, will find themselves asking, 'What will I do now?' THE CODE is more than another thriller, however. Sheldon is a fresh, talented emerging writer who can create complex characters and multifaceted circumstances. His ability to lull with the ordinary, then suck his characters slowly down into disaster, puts him in a class with the best of contemporary writers. Ken Sheldon will no doubt acquire a following of fans after this outstanding debut"
4,GREAT READ,"This book was hilarious, and tragic, and extremely heartfelt. We see a more real, more serious side of Tom Green in this book as he describes his basement-dwelling loser phase, his show, his cancer, and his marriage...all the while making you laugh out loud. Great read, and one of the better ""famous people talking about their lives"" books I've read this year....Tommy Lee only beat you because of his story about the ""squirter."""
4,Soothing and mysterious,"""Life in Mono"" is an excellent song, and all the incarnations on this single are listenable and all contain their own identity. What more is there to say? Good song, good single, get it!"
1,Boring Dictionary of N/W Programming,"Though book is preety straight forward.It rarely talks about tricks,code is highly redundant in the sense that everywhere error checking is being done.Which makes it highly boring is that if you are dealing with some kind of N/W installation or S/W trobuleshooting.Talks much more on code,"
2,Dont need a religion lesson,"I was looking for a book with some insight into why people get into this Jihad business, but this books spends more time quoting the Koran and Bible than any real real life experiences the author may have had. very lacking"
5,"wow, its very enlightening","i really enjoyed reading the experiences of an adult college student. i , myself am one and i can relate to some of her college experiences. this book is marvelous for the adult attending college i recommend everyone read it."
1,WTF?,"Why is it that the world's worst bands make these tribute albums. Suicidal Tendencies is not a death metal band, and brilliant music covered by talentles death metal growlers is insulting and a waist of money. Perhaps it's a conspiracy in the entertainment industry put on by the same people who are keeping Steven Seagal's straight to video career alive. Or the legion of other straight to video bull s*#t like Cyber Mutt, and Funky Monkey.Kill my dog before he makes me write anything else, because if you don't, my dog will make me write something about you too.I know where you are,I know where you live,If you think I'm lying,Look behind you.I can't believe you actually did it."
5,"gg burns, graphic designer, illustrator and mixed media artist","Gloria Page has produced a book that can teach the most novice crafter to carve ... yet still inspires advance stamp and eraser artist to try something new and view their old methods from a different perspective. I've been participating in Gloria's on-line workshop as a moderator for A.R.T., (Artist of the Round Table) .. since Jan. '06. Gloria is a humble and sincere artist that enjoys teaching and helping others learn new techniques. I predict she will go far in the art/craft world in the next 10 years. I'm in awe of her warmth, compassion and ingenuity."
1,Laughter non-stop,"Ja Rule is such a joke it hurts.wrecking Stevie WOnder's ""Do I Do"" with this Lame Joke of a Re-Make with Case.Barking all the way through this song is so bad it makes me laugh hard."
5,A good time,"Good plot, great action. Like the addition of the patrolman to Rhymes office and love the agent from California! I can't wait to see the Watchman again - you know he'll be back!"
5,My Second Favorite Lincoln Rhyme Novel,"Of all of Jeffery Deaver's novels, ""The Bone Collector"" was my favorite. Now, though, ""The Cold Moon"" is coming in a close second. This book keeps you guessing throughout and certainly qualifies as a page-turner."
5,Loved it,I have been a fan of Jeffrey Deaver for many years and this novel was fantastic. I absolutely love his Lincoln Rhyme series. The story was suspenseful; kept you interested; humorous; made you think. I always try to figure them out but rarely do! Any fan of Deaver or Rhyme should read this one. I got the audio version as I rarely have time to sit down and read a book. Was great!
4,Very Good Read,This actually is a 4 1/2 star read. I usually do not read these types of books however being a clockmaster this one drew me in. Most of the information about clocks and watches was correct however there were a couple of things not true. Overall I liked this book very much. I thought the ending was just a tish lame but he left it open to bring back the Watchmaker so I was satisfied.
4,A nice neat package,"For anyone who has suffered from the UF Productivity Virus, this is the Vaccine. Definately a must have for any Geek. And a saver on Printer Paper. The organization and flow is wonderful...my only wish? More new content. But I'm not complaining, this will definately be a gift to anyone I know who has not discovered Illiad's masterpiece."
4,A Geeky Masterpiece!,The UserFriendly book is great! All the old jokes and stories are here. It's a wonderful book for anyone who wants to immortalize the web comic.
1,"Oh, sooooo funny!","Too bad it isn't possible to assign a 0 star rating. This book would have fully deserved it. You will be happier if you find another use for the 10 bucks this books cost (ANY other use).. except if you die laughing when you see Bill Gates or Microsoft mentioned in a phrase (which means you will also find me very very funny). Tired jokes, IT support urban 'legends' recycled, tons of gratuitous MS references... all in all a weak attempt at humour (although, judging by all the 5 star ratings, there seems to be a crowd even for this type of humour)."
2,All 4 books could have been written as 1 book,"I read all 4 books in this series. It was interesting, but there was too much repetition throughout each book and each subsequent book gave repeated extended history from the previous books, which was really unnecessary. All 4 books could have been written as 1 book which would havce saved all the repetitious history. If reading the books one after the other as I did, it made for quite a boring book. I skipped quite a bit in the final 2 books. I can understand why the publisher discontinued this book. Well-written, but disappointing."
2,Not made in USA,"Not a reflection on product quality, but the package I received clearly indicates ""Made In Taiwan"". The Amazon description indicates Made in USA. I am subtracting stars only for the inaccuracy."
4,"Not the best, but still good.","This albu brings together the many people that was the Weavers. The main person is still Pete Seeger, but to hear the others blend in with those harmonies is just amazing. The set starts off with ""When The Saints Go Marching In"" and really continues to sizzle from there. The version of ""Wimoweh"" is one of the best I have ever heard. The other Carnegie Hall concert albums are better, but this one is very good. Buy it and enjoy. You will not regret it."
4,unexpectedly good!,"I admit, after so much crap I've watched recently, I wasn't expecting much from this one. Okay, it's not a blockbuster at all, but what should one expect from this kind of movie? The acting is convincing for the most part, and the effects are decent. The plot is a cliché, but the story is fun nonetheless. I'd recommmend it to fans of the genre like me."
1,Waste of time and money,"I knew about the death worms from the writings of the real Indiana Jones, Roy Chapman Andrews. I was hoping for a decent adventure tale, instead I got this piece of crap that had to have been written on toilet paper. When you think of Mongolia you think of deserts, so why was it filmed on Texas grasslands instead of Death Valley or Arizona? The local Mongolian lawman looked and sounded like a Texas sheriff. This movie is so unspeakably bad and disappointing on so many levels I can't believe it.(At least it wasn't filmed in Romania like High Plains Invaders!)This movie is the most expensive coaster I'll ever put my drinks on."
3,Once is enough,"ONE is a pretty good action game, however, you will frequently encounter difficult platform jumps. Sometimes you are 100% certain you will land on top of a platform and no harm will be done, but then, you won't make it. It's really frustrating.The action scenes are pretty decent, though. This is one action-packed game. If you see it for a cheap price, you might like it."
4,A great video for any child who like's big trucks and trains,"My two little boys love this video. It has a lot of moving truck, trains, and tractors. It also had an original song that they like to sing even after the video is off. I would definetely reccomend it. Susan Lantz"
5,My grandsons LOVE this video!!,"We have already worn out one VHS tape and had to buy another!!! I originally purchased this out of a clearance bin and was afraid I couldn't find it again. My grandsons were ages 1 & 3 when I first purchased this video and they LOVE to watch it several times in a row. Now, 3 years later I had to order another one!! They ALWAYS ask to watch this video when they visit ""Nana and Grandaddy"", I'm so glad to have another copy!!!!!! Informative (I was surprised to see they liked that) with a catchy tune."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING,WOW!!!!! This album is absoloutly incredible. My favorites are Don't save it all for Christmas Day that song brings me to my knees and the golry note. Holy crap that song is just utter perfection and gorgeous. My fav is Merry Christmas with love and this is Clay in hisw low voice and it makes my blood stand up and run I swear it hasn't yet found its correct place. Makes my toes curl just WOW!!!!! I love O Holy Night that voice is too special for words and we are so blessed to get to hear that spectacular voice. What are you doing New Years Eve is different. I hadn't heard it before yesterday and Clay just melts your heart with that song. Clay thank you so much for recording this album
2,"Vocals good as usual, but arrangements are a tad sterile.","Clay Aiken's voice is more suitable to the low-key style here, than on his solo album, but the arrangements are also a bit sterile and need more flair and better delivery.His singing's fine and while no one's going to exactly complain about Aiken's versions of familiar Christmas songs, there have been much better versions out there. Still worth picking up if you're a Clay Aiken fan, but not the best he can do -- he still has a good album in him, he just needs the right group of songwriters, producers who can bring out his best."
5,Great CD!!!!,"Clay sings like an angel on this CD. His voice touches your soul!I recommend this CD for everyone, he is a very talented artist and I know that he will continue to rise because of his great talent. Clay is a phenomenon and he is so original, no one sings like him. This is the first singer I am a big fan of. Go Clay!!!"
5,Clay Aiken Christmas C.D.,This CD is one of my favorite Christmas C.D.'s in my collection. I had been waiting for Clay to make a Christmas C.D. as I knew his voice would make the songs even more special. His voice is so pure and flawless. Great C.D.
2,Just one song,"I heard Clay Aiken's rendition of ""Mary did you know"" on youtube and fell in love with it so I bought this cd.I wish I had listened to the other Christmas songs on the cd before buying it because I now find that I am not as enamored of his rendition of them...I should have bought just the single song that I like."
3,IT's OK...,"There are 2 songs in this collection that are absolutely INCREDIBLE! Those 2 songs are ""Mary, Did You Know"" and ""Don't Save it all for Christmas Day"" However, these songs aside, this CD is just OK. I mean, Clay Aiken has a good voice and all, but, in my opinion, he doesn't shine on here the way he did on his ""Measure of a Man"" cd. The songs just come off as a little boring actually. And I love Christmas music. You know what, though, before anyone gets mad and threatens me :o Clay Aiken is still a great singer and I know that all of his die-hard fans will love this CD. (They actually probably own it already) I give it a slight recommendation because of the 2 great songs. :)"
5,Best Christmas CD in Years,"I listened to this CD continuously since I bought it. It is absolutely beautiful. I would recommend it to anyone. I particularly love O Holy Night, Merry Christmas With Love, Mary Did You Know and Don't Save it All For Christmas Day."
5,Absolutely the Greatest,"Fantastic Christmas Album. Clay is clearly in his elements and this is definitely going to be my all time favourite every time Christmas comes around.His voice is crisp and clear, and his joy and jubilation comes through convincingly. ""Mary did you know"" bears special mention because it was absolutely mesmerising.In all, a captivating album well worth every cent. This album will make me wait with bated breath for his next.Clay has indeed redeemed himself with this album. His debut was, how should I put it, nondescript and a waste of his talent.But he is clearly king of the heap with this one.Get it, it's a great addition to any Christmas collection, proving that the songs don't have to be different to make it good when the voice is good enough."
5,"Velvet, Pure Velvet!!!","This is a hauntingly beautiful Christmas Album. Clay Aiken has a voice that glides through your soul like ski's on snow. I love how he sends us his emotions so givingly. I have always loved Christmas music more than any other and this album will be on the top of my play stack forever. I have bought extras just so my children and Grand children to be will be able to enjoy it. It is a Holiday Album that will last through the ages right along side of Bing Crosby and Brenda Lee. If you have not heard it, you won't be sorry if you go get it. It is so beautiful!!!"
5,Truly Amazing Timeless Classic,Clay Aiken's Merry Christmas With Love is one of the most amazing christmas albums I have ever heard. This one will be played for years to come. Simply beautiful. Mary Did You Know is one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard. I highly recommend this CD. Beautifully produced. Clay's voice is perfect on each song and gives me chills just listening.His voice is truly one of those that does not come along very often.
5,Classic in the Making,"This CD is a Christmas classic in the making. Even people who are not Aiken fans will find it's rich with Aiken's superb vocals and classical instrumentations. If they give grammies for Christmas CD's, this deserves one."
4,Clay Makes A Classic Christmas Album,"Clay should have won American Idol, but this is also the only good album he's made yet. He does the classics well. It's your standard Christmas album, take the songs as is, use the Clay voice, and it's a hit. The originals on the album stink, which is why his other stuff is no good, he has bad original songs. But his covers are very good. ""O Holy Night"", ""Mary Did You Know"", ""Winter Wonderland"", are among the highlights.Overall, if you're looking for an original album, look elsewhere. These are just Christmas songs with the Clay voice. That said, he has a great voice. So if you're looking for the Christmas standards, look here, looking for something more original? Grab Relient K's Christmas album."
5,WOW! Clay is AWESOME! Best Christmas CD EVER!!,"I waited for this CD for so long and I finally got it today from Amazon.com. YEAH!! (I admit I was jumping up and down like a little girl) :)Clay delivers music like no one else! When I listened to this CD for the first time, I got chills and goosebumps! I even cried when ""Mary Did You Know"" was playing.Clay surely came out as the true winner of American Idol 2. He proved that talents will get you far. He inspires so many people with his faith in God and his kindness to others.This CD is the perfect Christmas gift for anyone who appreciates genuine talents and great music. This is an instant classic!"
5,Merry Christmas With Love and more!!!!! Beautiful,I loved this CD so much!!! I played it the whole Christmas season!!! My friends told me they have played their copies at least 100x and love it so much. Clay Aiken's voice is awesome and beyond!!
1,Don't waste your money,"My daughter received this toy for a birthday present. I kept reading the instructions trying to figure out how to get the music to come on - I just refused to believe there was no music! You're supposed to try to follow along to the blinking lights, but the mat keeps moving and you can't keep up with the lights. You're supposed to turn on your own music, but the lights won't match the beat. Even my five year old thought this toy should be returned. How many kids are willing to give up a birthday present?!"
1,Dance Maker was a bust!,It came with no directions. My Granddaughter is still trying to figure it out and it is almost Feb and I gave it to her for Christmas.
3,Tangled relationships,"This is not a typical romance novel, though there is romance in it. It's about a group of women who have been friends for a long time and the tangled personal relationships they are in. Blair is the love 'em and leave 'em type who says she likes her freedom, but can't admit that she can't find anyone to fill the hole in her emotions, especially the one her mother left when she rejected Blair for her lifestyle. Natalie and Annie serve as the model for the group with their ten year marriage, except that Natalie, who is about to turn 40, thinks she's living a lie. And Leah is determined to find the same kind of relationship, no matter how many women she has to date. The book traces their interactions and how they try to find out what they want in all of these relationships."
3,Chia Pet,The only problem I had- it didn't come with a drip tray like it was supposed to. :( Cheated me
1,Who Knows.,"I ordered this Pioneer plasma tv on December 13th and I still don't have the tv. It was lost the first time and had to reorder. The second order was placed around two weeks ago and guess what - still no tv. I have ordered books and smaller items several times from amazon with no problem, but it is obvious the higher end items are handled a little different. Amazon has yet to offer me anything except $30 off of my next order...whoopie. I'll continue to buy the smaller items, but for the bigger ticket items go to Best Buy or Circuit City and pay more, but know that I will get the service I expect from a high end purchase. Overall I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. I hear the tv is incredible, though. I am looking forward to seeing it in person."
4,replacement tap,this was a replacement for an existing tap that got broken.It works well and will suit my needs nicely. Hope not to have to change it again any time soon.
4,A/C Adapter Review,"My A/C adapter worked like a charm, the only issue I had with this purchase was I couldn't tell if the adapter was new or used. It came in the box which was used to mail it in.(USPS box) There was no factory wrapping around my adapter, nothing. Just placed in the box just like that, with some packing. Without the plastic factory sealed packaging around the adapter, who can tell if it was new or used? It sure did work,though!! It's a must have for your micro helicopter. Just remember, how you see it in the picture, is how you might actually get it."
2,No menu-no closed captioning-inaudible-muffled sound,"The DVD itself is of such a low quality. It has no menu, no closed captioning. I can't hear it. The sound is muffled, which makes it even harder to hear. Not one word of Lawrence Olivier's is audible. Or a lot of the other actors. What I don't understand is, if there are so many big names in this version, why is the actual DVD of such low quality? If I'd known this I certainly wouldn't have bought this DVD. But the seller did everything right on their end. It wasn't their fault there's no closed captioning available on this DVD."
4,fair,"This knife was ok, after hearing reviews I was kinda hyped but I already have sharp knives so I kinda wasted my moneys. My mistake, I'll make sure I use it though."
3,Returning,"Great price, good looks, cool design, nice features.The only problem is ... I can't hear anything using either handset. Will return to the store for refund...although it was a great deal on BF."
4,Great!,Very good.. I downloaded some mp3 files off their website. I really liked what I heard and bought the album. Good songwriting.
4,good read,"good read, it informs the reader just how corrupt the british system really is. a must read for any one that thinks the ira are terrorist.it will show you that the brits may be the real terrorist.you will leave feeling bad for the agent even if you are pro ira."
5,I LOVE THIS BIKE!,"My husband bought this bike for me for Christmas and I LOVE it. I don't see one thing wrong with this bike. I ride everyday and in my basket is my 7lb. dog, who loves going with me. The handle bars are perfect, the seat is comfortable, it rides great. There are a few dents in the finders but who cares or sees them, it doesn't change how the bike performs. So if you are thinking of buying this bike, DO! A big thank you to my husband for getting me this bike."
4,bumpy start but I LOVE it!,"I shopped everywhere for just the bike I wanted! Bike arrived on time as promised. As it said in the description some assembly was required, however the instructions were impossible. It wasn't even for my style of bike! Not to mention it had some scratchs in the paint on the frame and a couple of screws were missing but I did not give up. I went ot the local hardware store and bought the screws. It took about an hour to figure out how to get it together and afterwards I rode it to the local bike shop for them to inspect. It cost $50 for adjustments and tighten but now my bike is perfect and I love it! This is a great deal if you dont want to spend $500 for a bike, however be ready to do some leg work."
3,Stylish but Narrow,"They look very pretty, but these shoes are very narrow, and they are not that confortable if you have a wide foot."
2,Read Shakespeare,"To appreciate this book, you have to believe, like Oscar Wilde, that the only interesting thing about criticism is the personality of the critic. That's what you get, not Shakespeare. If you like the personality, you'll like the book; if not, not. You may also learn about projection: Bloom lumps his critical contemporaries into a ""school of resentment,"" but all the resentment comes from this aging critic. You could also read the earlier critics on whom Bloom builds. Or just read Shakespeare."
1,Unfortunate worship,"Bloom seems to hold the ""School of Resentment"" to represent what is wrong with Shakespeare criticism, with literary criticism in particular. Ironically, this book is exactly the sort of thing that critics in the ""School of Resentment"" point to when *they* discuss what is wrong with Shakespeare criticism.And both sides are correct. While Bloom is correct in despising the postmodernists for their arrogant, narrow-minded nihilism, Bloom in his own book demonstrates the sort of arrogant, narrow-minded hero-worship that the postmodernists are overreacting against.This book is another unfortunate--and unfortunately popular--contribution to the gulf that separates literary criticism from reality."
4,Powerful but uneven,"This book on Shakespeare's plays, focusing on the characters, is fascinating but uneven. His analysis of the motivation of Prince Hal and of Iago are the best I've read and are rooted in the texts; on the other hand, his section on Hamlet is tiresome, devoted to his own theory that Shakespeare rather than Kyd wrote the crude, original Hamlet (Bloom gives no evidence to support his assertion). Nor am I convinced by his theory that his favorite characters (Hamlet, Falstaff, Rosalind) are Nietzschean supermen created centuries before Nietzsche. However, they are enough intriguing ideas to make it worth the read."
3,Lots of great content. A bit windy.,"I picked this up because I wanted to be re-introduced to Shakespeare. I was not disappointed on that score. There are bold assertions, to be sure, but also a wealth of tasty tid bits, anecdotes, social commentary and generally thought provoking writing. On the other hand, Bloom seems to repeat himself a bit often, and one occasionally wonders where the editor was."
3,High Bardolotry Nonsense,"Professor Bloom admits in this book that he is a promoter of ""High Bardolotry,"" the hoary tradition of the veneration of Shakespeare as a revelator of near god-like status. If you go for that sort of thing, then this book is for you. And the book is a tour de force in literay criticism. The author does know his subject, and presents some interesting insights along the way. But at the end of the day, I think most people will conclude that a mentally stable person would never write or much enjoy this book."
2,Caution from a Mac fan,"As a long-time Mac user I was really anticipating great things from this new PowerBook (Superdrive model). So far, in three months I have had two logic board replacements, screen defects, and now a slot-loading DVD drive defect which Apple refuses to repair under warranty. It's been in the shop for a total of four weeks -- so far; and it's still there now. Apple still has the best systems, in my opinion, but their service leaves a lot to be desired. I've had many Macs before this which were flawless, but I think Apple's quality assurance slipped with this model."
3,Does the job.,What can you say about a seam sealer. Goes on easy enough and sticks to silicone treated materials. I am not fond of the feeling of the seam after treatment (feels tacky even though it isn't) but the instructions say that can be cleared up with some unscented talc.
1,Dissappointing,"This was my first Stuart Woods book. It is dreadful. The writing style is like a child with completely irrelevant adjectives and superficial mention of stuff that really doesn't matter and little overall depth. Woods has little grasp of modern technology - I thought it was written a decade earlier than it actually was. The plot is crass and makes little real sense, the author tried to make it more interesting by bringing some ex-spies however they improved it little.The authors note Mr Woods monologue to his readers is pointless. I have no ""irresistible urge"" to report errors in the book. Correcting them won't improve it."
3,Annual Update on Stone Barrington,"This book is your annual update on Stone Barrington. In other words, if you have read the series and enjoy the character, you will enjoy this quick simple read. Typical antics of Stone and his friends. Summer beach read and catch up on Stone.In the series, it is not the best yet it is a MUST for fans of the series. Maybe be author does need a break from the character as your reader reviews indicate..but I would hate to see this character retire. FANS LOVE HIM and will enjoy this story."
2,Drivel,"As a huge fan of ""Chiefs"", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try. What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a ""spit out thinly plotted books"" machine. Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will. When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work. As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable. Run from this one!"
1,Pathetic,"I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane. Not one of my better decisions. Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in ""Dragnet."" We are talking zero development of characters. Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books. Well, he's wrong. You basically just don't care about these people. They aren't real, and they talk weird. Not much action either, unless you count actions like: they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane. You get the picture. This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money. Don't fall into his trap like I did. There are a lot better books out there."
1,Stuart Woods where are you?,It's hard to imagine the same pen that wrote Run Before the Wind and Palindrome writing such silly dribble as Dark Harbor. I found myself laughing and rolling my eyes at some of the ridiculous characters and situations. I'm wondering if maybe Stuart Woods has been kidnapped by a set of triplets who are holding him (for what?) and making him write for food.
2,What? Exactly!,"This book gets two stars because I actually read the whole book. What a dumb plot. And what's with the characters? Everyone has a pilot's license in their back pocket, they all have 5 million dollars waiting for them somewhere, and a bunch of other seemingly disconnected coincidences, which is a lame attempt to resolve the ridiculous plot.Woods, buddy, please for the love of God and all humanity, get some better names for your characters. Stone Barrington? And his grilfriend is named Arrington? Huh?Stone Barrington is investigating a murder case about his cousin whose last name is Stone. How stupid is that? What a childish/amateur way of trying to make a plot twist.The one bright spot in this book...never mind, there isn't one."
3,I loved it until...,I loved this phone until I realized that the people I was talking to couldn't understand me. It is crackly like a really bad connection and it's not my line because my other phones work great. I highly recommend this phone for its handset speaker phone and it's high quality of sound on my end. The Caller IQ is of no use to me. I like it so much that I am going to return this one and try one more time.
3,Good choice if you're strong perhaps,"I am a woman of average or below average strength, and I could barely get this stuff out of the tube. Had I been able to apply it evenly, it may have been very effective. As it was, it took all my strength to get this out of the tube, and I wasn't able to effectively apply it to the surface I was interested in. With much sweat and difficulty, I finally managed to get it onto most of the outline of the sink I was trying to decaulk, and I was able to remove all the silicone caulk, so I guess this stuff did its job. Because of my inaccuracy, however, I used an entire tube on one small sink.I have some more jobs to do, and I'm going to purchase some caulk remover I can use with a caulking gun."
3,"okay, if you REALLY are into running.","When I bought this book; I was into 5Ks (which I still walk/jog). The articles are well-written, his humor is delightful, and his advice is very easy to follow. The problem is, Im not 'geared' to be a serious runner, never will be. I am doing 5Ks, for fitness, for moxie, (for the t-shirts too), but all out running, no. I swing kettlebells, walk, swim, but not serious mile upon mile running. I am somewhat overweight, which I hope to remedy, by means other than expensive running shoes, and pounding the pavement. Otherwise, this IS a good book."
2,this book offers very little practical advice,"After reading such fabulous reviews of this book, I was eagerly anticipating reading it. I was very disappointed. Many of us have tried and failed and tried and failed and tried and failed at running. In my case, this was because I really didn't know how to train. I would try to do too much, and wind up doing too little, and quitting before I ever improved.This book told me many times, it's OK to be a slow runner, but keep trying. It didn't tell me HOW to increase my stamina so that I could actually achieve anything. The only practical information I got was about buying running shoes.If you're looking for a lot of wordy inspiration, you might like this book. But if you want to know what you need to DO to progress from a non runner to a runner, Bob Glover's ""A Runner's Handbook"" is a much better bet."
5,Nice Upgrade from last etrex,"Etrex Vista keeps rulling on GPS units as the most user frendly and best cost benefit in the market! My previous model endured in the harsh tropical forest of Brazil pretty well, and I was even able to sell it before upgrading to this new one, with color screen and other additional nice features such as extended memory and USB communication ports."
3,Good So Far,I have just started reading the book so my views by change in a few days. So far it is OK.
2,Beauty's only skin deep,"I ordered this clock to replace an aging Waltham. After years of listening to the Waltham's steady ""tick-tock"", I was dissapointed to find out this clock doesn't ""tick"". And the chimes sound tinny and phony. The clock, however, is beautiful to look at. This one's going back to Amazon..."
1,I think it's fake!,"The allegations that this book is fake made me check what Neumann writes about the alleged pogrom in Allenstein in July 1936 (page 27-29). According to Neumann several Jews, including children, were killed. How strange, then, that I can't find any information about this anywhere else. The United States Holocaust Memorial web site doesn't mention it. Martin Gilbert, in his book ""The Holocaust"", doesn't mention it. Saul Friedländer, in his book ""Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933-1945"", doesn't mention. I would think that mass murder of Jews over 2 years prior to the Kristallnacht was fairly well known.But I'm glad I checked. Now I won't waste any more time on this book."
2,likely a fake,"The style is highly suspicious and can be described as a kind of reverse-psychology approach. Whoever the author really was, he or she makes strangely bold statements that seem designed to cause a knee-jerk backlash from the reader so that the reader might object with ""oh how could he have believed such a thing!"" I suspect this is a fraud and that it was written to cause hatred of the subject instead of sympathy or empathy, and with a form of transparent child-psychology. The other books I've read, by those who likely were veterans, do not have this kind of knee-jerk style. And the mention of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion might be a tongue-in-cheek confession right in the reader's face."
1,worm is not off the hook,worms is a game where you camande worms and start shooting the other worms what fun is that? and it has no grafics in it at all?you just hit ohter worms in a cute girlish way? this game is wack
3,Dated,"All of Barron's FSI series uses dated materials and brute force audio-lingual methods of instruction (i.e. rote memorization,repetition practice, lexical drills). This course is no exception but it shows its age more than most, particularly with the emphasis on formal honorifics and outdated modes of expression. The more expensive Pimsleur Korean course practically does the same thing. Nonetheless there is value here, particularly given the lack of variety of Korean language learning materials. Just plan on doing some follow-up work unless you have Korean friends that can help you along the way. With the exception of the introductory section this course closely follows the format found in Barron's ""Mastering German"" but is quite different from the format in ""Mastering Italian."""
3,Masterinig Korean - review,"I have to say I am rather disappointed with this product. The print for the Korean alphabets and explanation are too small. It is very difficult to read them clearly.And I would have preferred the book to be written in more Hangul and English rather than in its coded form.One good point is that the drill exercises are good. It ensures that you know the topic well before moving on to another. For beginners this is really good practise.But if you are used to reading Hangul, then this is not recommended."
5,That awesome sound,These guy's got it. never have I heard such talent in the raw! Buy it and become a Believer.Who has two theremine's?
2,Please do not be confused about this author's name!,"To those who may be wondering if this is the same Abigail Garner who wrote the excellent book ""Families Like Mine"": it is NOT the same author! The conservative Christian views of the author of this book are different than the Minnesota author who wrote of her own experience of her parents' divorce when she was 5. The Abigail Garner who wrote ""Families Like Mine"" has been an activist for gay family rights for nearly a decade."
5,Therapy,"A great product to teach kids how to tie, but I use two different laces to help with discrimmination, so kids know what to do with each lace."
4,"Great Toy, just not Terribly Fun!","While this is not the funnest toy in the world, it is also fantastic. It's real wood, very durable, and nicely sized. I think this is such a fantastic way to teach your child to tie their laces, especially if you're like our family and use lots of slip-on shoes. Really cute, great buy, durable product."
4,Great idea,"My daughter is almost 5 and got this for Christmas. I love the concept and hope that she will use it eventually. Right now, she and her 3 year old sister would rather take the string off (it comes off completely which I don't like) and tie it around their necks and pretend to be puppies. So, for now it is on top of our fridge."
5,From Publisher's Weekly,"""Davies... does an impressive job of contextualizing the science within a political, economic and social framework, creating a lively tale as accessible to nonspecialists as it is to scientists."""
4,Great nutrition bar for low-carb dieters...pricey though,"The Atkin's Chocolate Peanut Butter bar is my favorite low-carb snack. It is big, sweet, goes great with coffee (decaf for you purists out there), and carries the typical nutritional advantages of a meal replacement bar.Unlike many other low-carb bars, this one is moist, though not gewy, sweet (but not sickly so, like so many low-fat high sugar bars), and filling.The one factor that brings this bar down is price. I can almost never find it at Walmart or Sam's Club in the economy-size boxes. Instead they are individually wrapped at about $2 each. In light of this, Amazon's deal is pretty good!Bottom-line: This is the ideal low-carb snack/meal replacement bar. However, when you see it sold in 15-count or 5-count boxes, by as many as you can!"
1,"Really bad quality, does not work with asterisk...","I got these phones to work with asterisk FXS modules on a TDM400P. Really bad sound quality like everyone else has said. If you hook them up through an Asterisk server and then take into account VoIP delay it gets really bad.Also, when you dial your number their is a really long delay in between each digit. Beep, wait, Beep, Wait, Beep...very annoying."
4,Great case,"This case was purchased for 60.00 with free s&h; a few days back through amazon. It arrived with no damage at all.The quality of construction, fitment, materials is spot on. Everything except the glue that holds the velcro on the fitment strips. These strips are included and allow you to adjust the case openings to your mixer/player's size so they do not shift around. The glue on some had given out and peeled off, quite a quick and simple fix with some hot glue. Honestly it's nothing major at all, nothing's perfect.The unit has great wheels at the bottom of it, with ball bearings that allows for easy transport. Overall the case is great."
5,The Book of Griswold and Wagner,"This book is a ""must have"" for anyone interested in cast iron cookware. It is great for identifying pieces, and gives histories of the major U.S. foundries. The photographs are exceptional. I found the information on reproductions to be most helpful. Many people complain that authors inflate the prices in their guides so that their own collections become more valuable. I feel that this book conveys the most accurate and fair pricing possible, taking into account the many variables that affect value, such as demand, true rarity, and reproductions."
4,"Tasteful, Lyrical and Timeless Jazz Duets","This recording has become a classic in my book, not because it's innovative or breaking new ground in any way but simply because it's so elegant and pure. Braff is one of the best mainstream players still around today who, while not a big force in the swing band era, was obviously influenced by it or at least by Bobby Hackett if no one else. I actually don't know much about Larkins but on this CD they complement each other very well and lay down some beautiful interpretations of these standards. Braff prefers the darker sound of the cornet (vs. trumpet) and Larkin's uncomplicated style provides a perfect river for Braff to navigate with interesting solos but ones that (fortunately) never stray too far from the original melody. Very nice stuff, easy to listen to but not ""easy listening"". If you like Bobby Hackett or Warren Vache you'll enjoy this recording."
2,Outdated,This book is outdated. There really is not any reason to read it unless you are a big fan of Heilbroner. The subject of the future faced by capitalism is covered more recently by Heilbroner in 21st Century Capitalism.
1,Not that good at all,"I have to say this book is not worth it. Its pretty badly/simply written, and there's not much content inside. Much better to get ""Adventures Beyond the Body : How to Experience Out-Of-Body Travel"" by William Buhlman which has all that's in this and much much much more."
2,Not bad.,"The ""How to have them"" section leaves a lot to be desired. The ""What to expect"" portions are pretty good. One of the better books, overall, on the topic that I have read."
3,Eh,"These work just ok. My forehead still is shiny from all the oils that build up, especially after lunch. Good ol' soap and water works better."
3,Mens Science Product - Oil Control Toweletts,"I like the Lab series brand but however I'm not a big fan of this particular product because is leaves white stuff from the toweletts on my face after I use them. Also, the toweletts should be more moist."
5,Most AWESOME book ever!,"This book is an awesome book! I could easily relate to Conner and his journey towards accepting God. The book is so well written that I could not put it down, I had to finish it. It is such an easy, yet enjoyable, book to read, I don't see how I could give it less than five stars. Gerasimou is a wonderful writer, and I hope to see him write many more books to come. BEST BOOK EVER by the COOLEST guy ever!"
2,"Ok, but certainly not good.","When I got my 60Gb Zen W, it was and is still fantastic. The only thing missing was any kind of case available. This skin was not even available when I first got my Zen, but when it did become available I did get it so as to have SOME kind of protection. As mentioned it will keep it from slipping, and protect it from rumbling around in a bag. It will not really PROTECT the Zen though. Since I have the original thick Zen W 60Gb I am being neglected in accessories. I did finally get a leather case that it fits in, but it is a little tight, but I can still access all the features and ports I need. This is a much better buy! Creative Zen Vision W 30GB 60GB Leather Case with Belt Clip Believe it or not, this case is also cheaper!!!"
4,eTrex Legend C and Cx,"Very good and capable. Takes a while to understand all the detailed features, but they are all very good."
3,Newer not always better...,"The eTrex Legend C does not still include those popular features that users have come to love and expect in the eTrex product line. The eTrex Legend basemap contains lakes, rivers, cities, interstates, national and state highways, railroads and coastlines. The Legend C will not even show towns like Ely Mn. or railroads. You have far less control in how you view data such as font size to view ETA ect., number of data fields ect. In map mode, try gettng rid of the ""heading"" data field so you see more map data?! I guess faster map updates are more important."
3,Didn't like it as much as I thought,I find that I did not enjoy this book as much. The heroine was too weak and the hero overpowering. LH earlier books seem to have this common theme of dependent women which drives me crazy. It's hard to read through this whole book and not cringe when the heroine does not stick up for herself. I much prefer reading Howard's new books with heroines who are spunky and confident.
2,"Very disappointing after ""Duncan's Bride""","Of all of Linda Howard's early, often dated, novels, ""Duncan's Bride"" is a favorite, so I was disappointed with the story of Maddy's brother Robert, who makes a definite impression in the first book. Yes, Robert's your typical Linda Howard alpha male hero and Evie is a sweet honorable woman in her own right, but somehow I felt there was something lacking in their relationship and this just made the illogical plot points more glaring. The story was just too contrived to be believable -- Evie a traitorous spy?! This made Robert seem none too bright. I find that I enjoy Linda Howard's books more when the heroines are just as strong as their men; otherwise they seem too dominated for a 90s story. Unfortunately, the repackaging and reissuing of LH's old books that disguise the fact that they were written in the 80s do a great disservice to the dynamic stories she's now producing."
1,Coby electronics brand,"This item deserves ZERO stars. After many attempts to activate this TV, the picture never appeared. It's a piece of junk! Don't buy it!"
3,Not too bad at all - This is a TV for my Kitchen wall !,"Hey. In Brazil, everybody had a little and cheap TV set on their kitchens. Mainly are cheat CRT (5' Tubes), with a boxed body. So. This Coby TV is a PERFECT replacement for this kind of aplication. I bought one today, to put it on my Kitchen Wall and i will have a tiny and thin LCD Widescreen TV set on my kitchens wall, to watch Cable TV channels while Breakfasting. :) So. This is perfect for me. I can even put it near my computer with PS2 pluged in to play some games on my spare times...I know there's a lot more better brands on the market, but in Brazil, this Tv is just arriving at the stores. And with a afordable price for us...So. It's not bat at all. Reception, on Cable, is not Bad. It's average good. For me at least..."
1,crash 'n burn,"My first Coby 7"" lasted 8 months until the picture failed - began to roll uncontrollably.My second Coby 7"" lasted two months - it 'smoked'the back plastic panel - melting the plastic.The sound is atrocious - you must use a set of Computer powered speakers.The picture - when the set is working - is Brilliant - none better."
1,"Coby TF-TV700 7"" Portable LCD TV/Monitor",Was ordered for my daughter-in=law birthday . The item did not work no picture or sound. Follow all the information in the booklet. Very unhappy and returning this product. Thank you!
1,"The High Energy Cookbook-Good Carb recipes for weight loss, health and vitality","This book was not what I was looking for apparently. I thought that the price was too high for the small amount of recipes and information on low glycemic food, as I thought it was supposed to."
5,The Weavers,"Very few musical groups gain the legendary status that the Weavers did, and not just because of the political controversy that the '50's cast over them. They preserved, promoted, and believed American folk song. This album reveals the joy and enthusiasm and professionalism of the original foursome: Pete Seeger, Lee Hayes, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman. You can't do any better."
4,Naptime Made Easy,"My son, Ghabe, goes to sleep in minutes after hearing the soothing notes of the first few songs. After his - ah, I doanwanna go nightnight - he takes off his clothes, puts them on his chair, goes pp, we read a story or two, gets tucked in. Then I put this in his computer CD drive and he's off to sleep. He used to jump around after the story and get me to fussing, not anymore. Thanks. You made this single Dad's life a bit easier."
5,Awesome Period,Our daughter is sleeping to good music and will no doubt have a good taste in the music she listens to later on ;-)
5,awesome product,This album is fantastic! My son loves it and my wife and I really enjoy playing it for him.It relaxes him right away and he sleeps very soundly throughout the night.I definitely recommend this CD!!!
3,"Regular Coldplay is better, but this is OK for small baby","Most Coldplay songs are soft and gentle, and baby-friendly as is. However, this is good for sleep time and for a very little one. It's plunky and dull compared to the others in the series I have, but as a lullabye it does the trick. It's way too boring for the parents to enjoy. Use this for bedtime and the real thing for music appreciation."
1,Sent as a gift - did not work,"Sadly, I ordered this as a gift and the recipient did not open it until the return date had gone past - only to find that it was defective and did not work. I will proabably think twice about direct shipping CD's in the future......."
2,Not as expected.,This case is made of good material and has excellent stitching but not the style I was looking for. It almost seems more like an inner liner for another camera case verses a stand alone case. Will be purchasing another style of case with more structure and protection for the camera. This case is holding my GPS and the adaptor cords. At least I could use the case for something.The information for the ship date and arrival time was not valid. Gave a tracking number which was less than helpful where the item was. The purchase was part of a birthday gift so was hoping it would arrive when stated but the package showed up five days after the delivery date stated.
2,the book so so,"the book seemed like it was all over the place and left lots of unanswered questions, I guess I should get the sequel...NOT!"
3,It was aiiight,"Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of Stringers work but this book started out good, excitement, trickery etc... but as the storyline pregressed it seems towards the end Vickie rushed to get the minor details through. The ending made no sense really and should've been alot better than what it was. If there is a sequel I will read it but I really wished I would've put this title on hold and read something else first."
3,The author did Us dirty!!!,"Ok this book was actually pretty good and held my attention all the way till the end,But thats where the problem came in, the ENDING.How Vickie go leave us hanging like that, I am so tired of these authors writing these half as*ed books.They start the story off good but the ending is incomplete and we readers have no closure to what happened, then they want to take years to put out a sequel and by that time we than forgot what the book was about.Its like they get lazy or something,This book could have been a whole lot better if the author went more in detail throughout the book I wont spoil it for those who havent read it ! But I will be buying the sequel Still Dirty out of curiosity because even though she left us hanging it was still a good read."
4,This Book has a great storyline!!,"This book was really good. The story line was great. Dirty Red is really DIRTY. With friends like her, who needs enemies??, however I love Vickie Stringer..I have read all of her books!!, but the ending was really disappointing, unless there is going to be a part 2. If the ending was better I would have given this book 5 stars."
4,Is it going to be a sequel,I read Ms Stringer's previous books and enjoyed them. Dirty red it started off catching my attention then it started to lose me.It really lost me in the end. I'm hoping there is a sequel and soon.
4,great read,"To me, this book was a page turner. The main character was something else.I can't wait for the sequel to this one, but being that I own all her books, I look forward to them all."
2,Tired Of Dirty Reading,"Although it was an okay read, this book got on my last nerve. I'm so sick of reading about trifling, gut-bucket, hood-rat, trifling females who will do anything and specialize in laying on their backs to support their ghetto lifestyles of the rich and famous. There are so many of these degrading books in print until I'm getting turned off with reading ""Urban"" novels. This one, although I love Vicki Stringer, is at the top of my list of all time trifling female characters. Although well written and catchy which Ms. Stringer is great at, I'm very sick of the story line."
4,DIRTY!!!!,I loved it but i hate how Vickie left me hanging at the end i was like come on!! But over all it was a great read!
4,small network management,"This book goes past the theory and straight to the heart of the matter. What we really bought this book for.The layout is user friendly and easy to search for your specific (as well as general) needs.Many of the books in this catagory are written to 'talk over your head' and 'try to impress you with the authors knowledge', this is not one of them. I could easly 'work with' this author. Though he is quite knowledgable in this publication, it is well written and quite helpfull."
1,"Great trilogy, but no HD-DVD???","I love the 6 movies, but COME ON!! NO HD-DVD????? Blu-ray is so expensive!! I have a 360, and may get an hd-dvd player off ebay. Unlike Blu-ray players, HD-DVD players are not like $400!"
2,Doesn't Work Properly,This particular set doesn't seem to play correctly on my BluRay. I have a brand new samsung smart blu ray do it has to be the discs. THEY TAKE FOREVER TO START AND SKIP MIDWAY THROUGH THEFILM.
1,"For an in depth review, please visit redlettermedia.com","Mr. Plinkett has dissected the terrible prequel trilogy in the best reviews of the films. That being said, why do people pay money for these? They are boring and poorly made. Expensive, but poorly made. While the originals are corny and flawed, they had character and heart. These cash-grabs are lifeless, uninspired wastes of time. Please people, stop supporting anything prequel related and ignore them. Just remember the original canon and forget the new."
2,Stars are on the movies not the disc,"The disc came as advertised. Problem is, even Blue Ray cannot save Ep1. In fact, the enhanced resolution may make it worse. Damn you George!!!"
4,great movies!,"i loved these movies since they have existed, but the case the came in was broken. I don't care about that too much, but I am a stickler about cases and all."
2,YODA! Say it isn't so!,"A CGI Yoda in the Phantom Menace?? The last performance by Frank Oz performing Yoda as a puppet has been chopped out of the film and replaced with the over articulate CGI Yoda. I can't believe it. It is very upsetting to see this happen. The product itself is well packaged with a slim case and easy navigation menus. The special features are lacking, just commentary. If you want special features buy the complete set on Blu Ray. I'm disappointed, however that is all the Star Wars franchise has been doing to me for years now. Lame. 2 Stars, only because I like the dvd packaging and menus."
2,"""I will milk them until the are dry.""--George Lucas","There's really not much to say about this DVD box set. It includes the three movies that make up the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy: THE PHANTOM MENANCE, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and THE REVENGE OF THE SITH. There are some extras on these discs, but don't be fulled by the way they are worded: everything on here has been released before. There is nothing new on the discs (unless there's some Easter egg I haven't found, yet). This is once again an example of George Lucas milking the cash cow for all it's worth. However, I think even die hard Star Wars fans have begun to see that George is really the President of the Trade Federation and have stopped buying re-treads like this.The only reason to buy this DVD box set is if you haven't already purchased thee movies before. Even if you haven't you might be able to buy all three separately and still get them for a total of about $5 less than this set."
5,Great. I had never watched so it was all new for me and my son,Wonderful movie set. I like that each movie has it's own cover so you can travel or just take the ones you want. We enjoyed watching them all. I am sure they will be watched over and over again.
5,Best rechargable battery's out there.,I have purchased alot of battery's for my Digital camera's. None come close to these battery's they out last every other 1400 Mah that I have including the Sony. The Sony ones are the only battery's that come close. These are also the same battery's that are sold in the pro camera shops.
1,"Charger-OK, Batteries-NO","The charger seems to work well, but these batteries were a huge disappointment. I assumed that because these were recommended as the choice of professional photographers, they must be good. Wrong. They did not hold their charge well, especially in storage, and once drained, never recharged fully. I bought Duracell rechargeables and they are infinitely better. Buy those instead."
2,poor charger,"the charger is really bad... i put the batteries in to charge...the charge light goes on, then a few minutes later it quits charging... i had to fiddle with the batteries 6 times to get the bats fully charged... if this is the problem on a stationary surface...how would the car charger work on a bumpy ride...i don't recommend this product...car charging is a great idea...but poor execution on optekas part"
3,NOT for chihuahuas,"This pen is sturdy and relatively well-built...but it does not work for chihuahuas. My puppy was up and over the pen in less than a minute. I've since found out from my vet, much to her amusement, that climbing is a talent of most chihuahuas."
3,Not top quality,"I have two exercise pens from midwest. First, I ordered the black one that was 24"" high but it was too short for my Pug. For this reason, I've decided to order the zinc one in 30"" tall frame. The biggest problem with Midwest pens are the shoddy material. The zinc is barely coated on this thing and the wires are very cheap. I would advise another brand simply because you get what you pay for. So yes it does work but please use this as an indoor playpen only. It WILL rust if left outside!"
3,OK,"This pen suits it purpose, the only complaint I have is that the bottom laych/lock is loose and my puppy tried getting out and got stuck. Looked like it hurt. I went out and bought more hooks and it's fixed."
4,"Good product,BUT..","We got this for our toy Cocjapoo. We had originally planned on setting it up in a square, bt the corner stabelizers only work on the octagon. After we figured it out it worked perfect. We use it as a indoor pen. He sleeps there, and if we leave the house we can put him in it. For the price this is very good!"
2,Not as good as it implies,I didn't find the stories as naughty as it states. They were rather boring.
3,From a-z just oh K,"This book features a variety of authors with different writing styles. Some of the stories are well written, but overall the book is just okay."
3,More pictures than text,"Pictures: *****Information: ** a bit vague for the year to year comparisons for my tates.I would probably not pay more than $10 for the book in Good condition, but I would recommend it for some light reading and the nice pictures.The lack of accuracy mentioned above must be taken into account for serious enthusiests however.John"
3,Ok quality,"I could not hear my baby's heartbeat at all up until birth with this, and the sound was only ok when using this to play music for me and the baby from my mp3 player."
5,A GOOD storage can.,.The 5 gal. gas can is great. Light but strong. No problems with that at all. People must remember that 5 gals. have some weight and may not be handled by everyone with ease. It works well. I use it to store gasoline for my snow blower and generator. It's vented and pours with out a problem. I like it.Ken
5,good quality gas can,Great gas can. Seems very sturdy. I bought this to store gas for my generator. It actually works great unlike the other carb compliant gas cans. I will buy more soon.
3,Not a replacement cd!,"What's up with the guy that says he bought this as a replacement for his well worn vinyl and it served the purpose? Did he actually listen all those years while the records were spinning? This cd reissue lacks 5 of the songs that were on the original LP that I actually HAVE listened to since 1970. The missing songs are: Green, Green Grass Of Home, Carry It On, Will The Circle Be Unbroken, London/Old Welsh Song and Silver Dagger! Since the reissue clocks in at around 70 minutes Vanguard could have at least given us Silver Dagger and London/Old Welsh Song and still put it all on one cd. If you are looking for a vinyl replacement this is not it. You will sorely miss the absent tracks. I am giving it only 3 stars because the title does not represent the contents. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
5,I Miss Zork!!,"I learned how to play computer games with Zork (I think it was all keyboard driven back then, you had to type) and now seriously miss the [annual] sequels. I thought we'd have an annual Zork tradition to look forward to, sort of like Christmas, every year but it's been almost 10 years now since Grand Inquisitor came out. So sad that Zork no longer rises anew every year."
4,Cleverly Done,"This Zork game follows in the grand tradition of the text-only Zork games. Overall, the graphics are good, the plot interesting and funny, and the gameplay fun. Though a bit harder to navigate if you are used to the text-only games where you can ask lots of questions, for the most part it is pretty fun to play. It is very similar to Myst because there is no fighting or other movement. There is 360 degree scanning so you can search all around the landscape but for the most part you are stuck in one place that the computer places you in. The humor is funny which makes it a good game to play and it is cleverly done, so I recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy role-playing games. I also definitely recommend this to fans of the text-based Zork games."
5,The One I Had to Review,"This CD is not in competition with her other ones. I love the others too. ""Blessed Are"" (disc 1) has the quality of seeming like a cohesive piece of art. To me, Ms Baez is a kind of jazz singer. I enjoy her whole songs, and in this case the whole CD, but there are moments, that she seems to have to work to find and create, when she does IT, that special voice quality that is perfect and so very beautiful. This CD has plenty of those and so don't her other CD's. In addition, ""Blessed Are"" is a nice little work of art."
3,Three Stars or May Be Less!,After The NY Times linked the Kindle and digital accounts they deserve my heartiest recommendation. I'm very satisfied reading on both Kindle and laptop. The only issue I wish them to fix is the formatting of the kindle edition. The page is not very well formatted as the lines are not even. Otherwise I'm very satisfied.Update 09/21/12I don't understand why the NY Times don't allow reading single issues on Kindle for iPad? The only option is to pay $20 per month for their iPad app which is too much for many people. I hope the NY Times will correct that.
3,Test it before you subscribe,"I am a subscriber to the NYT print version and bought the Kindle edition (for 99c) on a day when I got stuck in a traffic jam (the beauty of immediate wireless delivery that comes with a Kindle.) The presentation of the paper on Kindle is ok, though not all graphics are available compared to the print version. But I still prefer the print version: When it comes to newspapers, a big sheet of paper giving you many articles at a glance is better than clicking through one article at a time."
3,"Would LOVE a ""Sundays Only"" subscription option!","Very poorly formatted for Kindle. However, I download it every Sunday, and read it at my leisure during the week. I can't help but think that there is a market for Sundays-only subscriptions, and I wish NYT would offer that option."
2,Saturday,"Not much to read in the Saturday edition, maybe I just hit a slow Saturday. The headlines were fine, but I was looking for some in-depth reading, and I didn't get it for this Saturday paper. I am sure that during the week it is better."
1,Liberal Rag,Save your money and buy the wall street journal. The New York Times is filled with nothing but hate spewing articles that even it's own reporters have admitted are pure fabrication.The only reason I gave it 1 star was because there was no way to give it a negative rating.
4,One of the best written papers,"I am a weekend subscriber to NYT and occasionally read dailies on my Kindle. It has lost some of its reputation for objectivity since it editorials are basically slanted for social justice and inclusivity, which I endorse. It has also had a few journalistic slips, but if you want to know what is going on in the world in all categories of life, you find it and are well informed from your reading."
4,highway robbery,Love the full print Times. I am a young and avid devourer of newspapers. I live on the west coast and was a print subscriber until the recession forced me to scale back. This price is shameful for a partial electronic version. Who are they kidding?
1,Price gouging,"I rarely feel inclined to review content I buy on Amazon, but I was a subscriber to the NYT when the price was $13-14, and I was appalled at the grotesque price hike. I decided to bite the bullet for the old price in return for the content already available for FREE on the NYT website reformatted for the kindle. But when I received a e-mail notifying me the price would increase to $20/month, I immediately logged on and canceled my subscription. Amazon and the NYT won't learn that rising the price is moving the wrong direction with price elasticity. Who's going to adopt the kindle when prices keep rising. This is definitely not an effective business model for a device already in danger to losing out to other e-readers, an iPad, etc. I regret buying the kindle with the assumption the prices would slowly fall as more adopted it. I was wrong, instead publishers are pulling out and rising prices killing the technology. No thank you."
2,Half the product at full price,"Highly deceptive to offer the newspaper with only half the content. If the price needs to be more, so be it, but don't pretend it's the real deal..."
1,"Insane pricing, especially vs. digital access or print sub","The New York Times appears to have lost its mind. First, the Digital Access subscription plans are already overpriced when you consider that full access comes free with any print subscription--including Sunday only delivery, an option that NYT doesn't advertise but is available. But when full digital access to the website and tablet/smartphone apps can be had a la carte for under $20 to $35/month, a separate $20 charge for Kindle access is just laughable."
2,cancel subscription of ny times,i have been trying to notify you i dont want to subscrie to the times. appreciated the chance to try it out but i cannot subscribe. w. eaton
5,A real pleasure !,I enjoyed the in depth coverage that is lacking in my local newspaper. It was convenient to put my Kindle in the brief case and read the news at my leisure.
3,Love the New York Times...Kindle edition is only okay,"The kindle version of the NYTimes is a good way to get a sense of what's going on in the paper, but it feels like a very linear newsletter. The limitations are the Kindle's (I have an older version--don't know what happens with the Fire). It's a good way to get the news when you don't have any alternatives, but it's not at all like reading Times on paper, online or on an ipad."
5,The New York Times,"Very comprehensive coverage of current events all over the world as well as fair coverage of sports, business, the arts, technology, medicine, social topics. Relatively fair and balanced, though liberal leaning and that's for the best. A truly great international newspaper."
3,$14 for Kindle NYT subscription that is free online?,"Just got my Kindle2 and really love it; but,I don't understand why Amazon is charging $14 for the NYTimes Kindle Edition subscription when the same is available online for nothing. I haven't checked the other Kindle subscriptions but I compared the Kindle Edition to the online offered by the NYTimes and I could find no difference. This makes the subscription part of Kindle worthless unless one has no source to the free online edition."
2,Not worth the new price,"$19.99 is ridiculous considering the WSJ is $5 less per month. I'll be canceling my subscription given the price increase, especially since I only read through it once or twice a week. On the off days I do want to read it, I'll download the single issue."
4,NYTimes,The Sunday Times for 99 cents is a bargainPhotographic reproduction is only fair as are the graphsNo crossword puzzleDrats
3,Too much for so little,"I love NY Times but there's a lot missing in the kindle version. I'd rather pay the full price and get it all than this cut-rate, compromised version."
2,Crippled - More available on BlackBerry for FREE than with Kindle,"I had high hopes for the NYT on my Kindle. The *free* online version on my BlackBerry includes all of the sections one would be interested in. What is The Times thinking in their Kindle edition? You give me obituaries but don't even give me access to articles on education or science? This is either a sad commentary on our society or a sad commentary on the NYT.Don't waste your money! As much as I adore the NYT, I will not waste $20 a month on a crippleware version when I can get everything I want from the NYT on my BlackBerry for *free*Why would anyone pay $240 a year to get *LESS* than they can get for free?"
2,What is the NYT thinking?,Who is in charge of the NYT's electronic publishing? The new Amazon price reflects a 30% increase and the product still provides less content than what you can get free on the internet.
2,overpriced,"with all due respect to the nyt, this should be priced at $10.00 per month. the current price point is highly unreasonable for something that is readily available online for free."
2,Great but incomplete,"The app works well and is easy to use. Very convenient, it updates automatically and is waiting for me in the morning. But it is incomplete; not all of the articles are available. Perhaps even worse, not all (or even most) photos and graphs are included. Very disappointing."
2,13.99? Really?,I love the New York Times and am a home subscriber. Love the online adobe app reader edition as well. Looking forward to getting it on my kindle but 13.99? Really? That's seems way too high for something that is otherwise free online.Come on NYTimes. Come back to reality. You'll get more subscribers.
2,Why is this better than free NYT on iPhone,"I am considering this but why, other than maybe more readable given the Kindle screen vs the iPhone screen, is this worth $14/month vs free and in color on the iPhone?"
2,intermittent deliivery,twice this week the nyt has not arrived even though the kindle displayed 5 bars all day every day of the same week jfk
3,Too much missing,Love it. Except that the Science and Travel sections of the Times do not show up on the Kindle... now searching for someone who can tell me why...
3,Where's the Rest of it?,"Generally pleased with my subscription but VERY annoyed that, in contrast to the description that it will include NYT articles sans graphs, charts and crossword--what you're not told and I tried very hard to find out before ordering--is that several articles are omitted from each edition and sometimes the articles that are included abruptly end, chopping off the final few sentences or paragraph. Yesterday's Sunday edition (Aug 24) only had 3 articles from the Book Review--a fraction of that section. This flaw needs work fixing or NYT need to state the subscription contents clearly."
1,The incomplete edition,"I'm flabbergasted. Why on earth would the New York Times publish an electronic version that omits entire sections and many articles that appear in its print version? The tide is rapidly turning against print journalism generally; free news content abounds on the Internet. So why on earth would the Times stiff subscribers by providing less content?We can bemoan the advent of e-publishing to no end, but the handwriting is on the wall: the days of pulp and ink are drawing to a close, especially for newspapers and periodicals. If and when the Times leadership begins publishing the full print edition for e-readers, then I will consider subscribing again. But until then, consider my subscription cancelled."
3,NYTimes.com soon?,"About three weeks ago, the New York Times announced ""Subscribers to The New York Times on Kindle...will receive full access to NYTimes.com. We are currently working through the technical requirements to verify Kindle...subscriber accounts and offer access. More information will be available soon.""See #28 here: [...]I telephoned Customer Service at NYT earlier this morning (SAT 16-Apr-2011). They do not have anything in place yet, with no estimate of when the ""technical requirements"" will be met.Once full online access occurs for Kindle subscribers, then the $20 a month charge would make more sense. Until then, I'll continue to subscribe to the Global Edition of the Times: the International Herald Tribune ($10 a month). The person I spoke with at Customer Service could not tell me if there would be a plan in place for IHT Kindle subscribers."
4,Works for me,"I like the convenience, price, and lack of paper. I miss not being able to clip articles although I know there is a way to do this on my kindle."
1,Thanks to all....,"that wrote the NYT does not include the entire paper.Also checked with a friend that has a kindle & gets the NYT.Said it has been improving, but still lacking. And the NJ coverage is totally lacking."
2,Love the Paper!!!! Hate the Price!!!!,"Totally love this paper, it has so much more to offer than anything else out there. But the price is twice anything else on Kindle is up for. I may as well just buy to whole other papers and still get off cheaper with all the news I need."
2,Why double pricing?,I take the print edition and why should I buy another edition on the Kindle? This is just more monstrous USA capitalism in action. The reason America is in such a sorry and pathetic mess.
4,Shines on the Kindle,"I consider the Times The gold standard of newsprint. From the front page to the book review, every issue is a pleasure to read. On the Kindle the pleasure only increases. I simply cannot imagine a better way to enjoy this outstanding publication.I would have given it a full five stars, but the cost is too high for that. Having said that, you do get what you pay for and this is worth every dime."
2,"Good Content, Overpriced...",If the price on this was $5.99 - this would be a five star review...at 9.99 three stars. The formatting is acceptable and content is excellent but pricing?? I have no idea why this is priced so high other than the huge bite that Amazon keeps on these.
2,Save Your Money,I expected to get most of the newspaper wnen I got my free trial. I won't be subscribing and if I can figure out how to cancel the trial will be doing that. There is not nearly enough coverage here an the sneaky little secret is that you can pretty much the whole paper by downloading it from Google and bookmarking it.
4,Good but stll needs some work,I was pleasantly surprised at what a good experience read this paper on the kindle this was. It could use a few more pics. The price was 1\4 of the print price. Adding a Sunday only subscription would be a good idea. Cannot beat the convieniece.
2,To Much money,I am new to the Kindle word and read all the reviews with much interest. I REALLY like the NYTimes BUT for the money being asked I believe there are better products out there. To bad but I wont be getting This newspaper. Capt Bob was right..Just to much money
3,Why no word count,Lack ofword count a with WSJ and FT is annoying. hard to tell if article is brief item or nearly magazine length
2,Gouging the early adopters,"It's almost worth it because the NY Times is worth reading in almost any format. But the articles are cut back, the content only updates once a day and there apparently is no Sunday paper. I just checked the kindle site and nowhere are any of these facts mentioned. They could do better: instead of being the target of so much grumbling, the Times could have been the killer app."
1,HOW DO I CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION,I want to cancel before my 14 day free subscription is up. You have apparently hidden the cancelation option.I guess I will have to call to cancel. I thought it would have pictures and charts. It is not the same as reading the NYT on the internet. Please cancel my subscripti0n.
3,"Some good qualities, but far too pricey for what is delivered.","When I ordered the NY Times for Kindle, I was very excited as I am an avid reader of this publication online and in print. However, I soon found that a number of the articles are not found in the Kindle version. I also soon realized that most of the political cartoons and photos are also absent. For $19.99 each month, I was expected much more out of this subscription. The weekender is also painfully thin. If $20 is not an issue to pay, it is convenient, but you will be missing some sizable portions of the print version."
3,hmm....i already have a subcription help,so i was wondering if anyone could answer my question....i ordered a weekend subcription of the ny tims and it said all acessto ebooks ipad iphone etc and i was wondering if i could get the ny times on my kindlefor free since i already bought a sbcription for online the paper amd electronc devices.....oh and sorry for the bad typing i have trouble typing on my kindel
4,A Promise at Gettysburg. . .,"Nine-year-old Virginia Dickens is left in the care of Reverend and Mrs. McCully while her father and brother help her uncle hide his horses from the Confederate raiders and fight. She promises to keep a journal for Jed, her brother. Her family thinks she'll be safe but they are wronged when Gettysburg is ambushed. After the battle, she and her father find her brother in a makeshift hospital. The book ends as the town slowly recovers and Virginia hears President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.Mrs. Osborne has successfully creates individual characters, and she poses difficult questions about war and the waste of human life. There is a lyrical quality to several passages, and the author slowly builds suspense and release.Also recommended: All the Dear America Books"
4,GOOD BOOK FOR BEGINNERS,"I read the German and Spanish language versions of this book when I was 14 or 15 years old, and it left such good impression on me that I tried for many years to get a hold of a copy...Now, about a decade later I bought the book in English... BUT once I read it, it rather disappointed me. I perceive it rather too basic and superficial. It is a good book though for those who want to get a very general glimpse at the history of Western thought."
2,The discourse of Western Philosphy,"Johannes Hirschberger has surely spent a lot of time in writing this book -written in German, and this book is being used by many students who are searching for a guidance into the discourse of Western Philosophy. Hirschberger has outlined the standing points of each main figures of Western though, such as Plato and Aristotle to Augustinus and Aquinas. And these points are clear and well seperated. But many students (including myself) will no doubt fall into the abysmal discourse of ""how to interconnect"" their thoughts to their main discourses. Philosophers may have said many things in their lives, but are outlined straight forward, but this book stresses points to the ideas and thoughts in theoretical order instead of the essential influence of themselves. In all, more cautious study and review is recommended before picking up this book as an ""guidance"" to the Philosophy of the West."
2,Missing features as stated in the description,"This is a beautiful clock - as most Seth Thomas Clocks are - the only thing is that the description indicates it has an auto night shut off - it doesn't. It also doesn't have volume control. Although the chime is charming, it is quite loud. My mother fell in love with the clock and didn't want us to return it and also didn't want us to flip the switch to turn the chime off, so we took the face plate off of the speaker and put cotton balls in to reduce the sound. It worked satisfactorily for her. Someone needs to change the description of this clock so that customer knows what they're getting. There's too many manufacturers out there that aren't careful about the descriptions and the customer winds up having to pay return shipping charges because they're not getting what is advertised."
2,"Looks great, but very disappointing chime","I bought this clock to replace what appeared to be its predecessor from Seth Thomas, which I received as a gift 11 years ago. The older one had stopped working, but once upon a time, it had an hourly strike and quarter-hour chime. This new clock has neither - its only audible feature is an hourly chime - and it sounds like a cheap doorbell. We hate it. The clock looks really pretty, but if you're looking for an appealing, old-fashioned chime and strike, you'll have to pay more for a better clock."
3,"A Book about poverty, change and maturity","The changes that go through Hari and lila contribute to their maturity ( as most family probs do) Children that come from 'broken' homes gain no happiness or wealth but only maturity- hopefully the problem is less over the generation but this depends on whether the change leads to more positive or rather a less negatve view of life or a devastation of any hopes left leading to ultimate destruction Ends tooo nicely, not enough substance, book ends as if author was rushed and had to deal with father's alcaholism and mother' sickness before reaching 50 pages! Would have been very much more effective in conveying message about life in poverty and the state of India's poorest slums."
5,Kershaw Blackout...Elegant simplicity,"I purchased the Kershaw Blackout about a month ago. It came out of the box reasonable sharp. It opens easily, quickly, and does not open accidentally when it is in your pocket. It is light, and retains an edge very well. I have sharpened it with a Lansky diamond hone, and the working edge is excellent. This is a great everyday knife, and I carry it without incident seven days a week.The speedsafe assisted opening feature is the best thing since sliced bread. It makes one handed deployment of the knife extremely easy and fast.I would have preferred the scales to be rubberized or something similar to G10, but that would raise the price of this otherwise excellent knife. I would recommend this knife to my friends in a heartbeat."
1,What does this extend?,"I bought this cable thinking it was an extension for the sensor bar of a Wii. That's not what it does, and there's no connector on the Wii I'm working with that it will fit."
3,"Somewhat simplistic, and sexist","This is a good introduction to REBT and Dr Ellis for new-comers, and a good attempt at adapting REBT to the specific problem of verbal abuse in relationships. However, it has a flaw- it assumes the abuser is always male (not alwasy the case in real life), and assumes the abuser is a creep who is clearly at fault, with the other party being a purely innocent victim. I am sure there are situations out there which resemble this. However, most day to day issues in relationships involve bilateral ""abuse"" of the subtle kind referred to in this book, usually between generally rational adults. Sure, one party may be more primary, but both engage in the behavior and ""trade blows"". Some of the advice in this book is difficult to apply at all in these cases. I guess these situations are more about communication breakdown rather than verbal abuse, so another book on that topic may be more appropriate."
1,Couldn't be more off base,"I agree with the review by ""A Customer"" in regards to the ""BAD"" and the ""UGLY"". I found this book lacked real understanding and insight. More importantly, I found it a distortion of the reality of abuse. The authors have done a great disservice to targets of abusers. As far as I'm concerned, I would give it Zero stars if able to do so. If my therapist suggested this book, I would get another therapist.In my humble opinion, I would rank Lundy Bancroft's book ""Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"" the number book on the subject."
3,The Reading Roller Coaster,"This book is for the verbally abused person who has not already gotten off the roller coaster. I found it to have too much redundancy. Once I read the ""Secret"" I wanted to move on, but it went on, and on, and on. It took quite some time for the writer's to reveal the secret and get into the substance of the subject. Once it was revealed I got lost in the repetition. The subject is important, but the book could be done in the first five or six chapters. I would have enjoyed reading more case histories of how the ""secret"" was successful for others."
3,Very Poor Quality Control,"Mine has never quite worked right. Every few weeks, all the phones in the house would stop working, as if there was a phone off the hook. I eventually discovered that the problem was the Classco Jumbo Display Caller-ID. If I disconnected its power and then immediately reconnected it, everything was fine. It's the only jumbo caller-id unit that I know that handles Call Waiting Caller-ID, so I have continued to put up with it. LOTS of other people have reported various quality control problems with this unit. If you don't need CALL WAITING caller-id, then the Telnote unit is VASTLY better in every way."
2,Jumbo Caller ID,"Product arrived within specified time. However, after a few weeks of use, some segments of the numbers and names failed to display. This is not worth my time to ask for a replacement from the vendor. I can live with it. But I wonder if the vendor possibly obtained some defective ID's from the distributer."
3,Identity Crisis,"I'll try to keep this brief.Certainly it contains some fascinating biographical insights, but I felt it was more consumed with page after page of review-type song-by-song analyses of each album, and the aforementioned biographical insights seemed to be overwhelmingly comprised of anecdotes about Beefheart's ego & paranoia."
2,Lasts for about 6 months... horrible,"I paid top dollar for this phone as i can't stand how poorly made cordless phones can be. I believed that if I paid more, than somehow I would get a better phone! Whatever...Please don't buy this phone - the VTech (which I had previously) is far superior. The battery life on both phones is utterly ridiculous. I have owned this phone for 6 months and already I can't talk for more than 15 minutes (which, for my business is a must) without racing to give out my cell as the phone was about to die. One of them is completely worthless and won't hold a charge, the other lasts for 15 minutes. Panasonic should be ashamed - I wasted my money on this.The features work as they should however, so I can't complain there (thus the 2 stars). What good is it though if the phones don't work?"
1,Digital Breakup Problems,I am very happy with the features of these phones. I purchased an additional handset. Unfortunately the phones go digital on ordinary conversations every 5-10 seconds for the party calling me. I have had them for a week and am getting constant complaints from callers who cannot understand me over the chop.I really wanted these to work and like everything else about them.
5,Good Game,"I played this in Japanese as well as in English and I loved it both times. The idea of taking a group of generally normal students into a warped alternate version of their own world was wonderful as it makes the characters easy to get into. One of the best things is how much fun you can have talking to the demons that you meet, especially the pixies. The plot is fascinating and the gameplay is easy to pick up. The battle animation isn't great but is better than the other games of this series that I have played. The background music is catchy and you are bound to love the Chemist if you can understand the stores song. All in all is is a wonderful way to spend a few hundred hours."
5,stationery is tops,this stationery was even brighter in colour when i received it. it looks great and is on thicker paper stock as well. the stickers add that little extra ooomph.
4,A system for saving your sanity,"This book is all about applying engineering principles to document production. Basically, you start with questions like: ""Who is this documentation for?"" and ""What is the document's purpose?"". You then plan your document as a series of modules. By creating a title, abstract and outline for each module, you have a basis to discuss, test, plan and assign sections of the document. I've seen a few technical books follow the layout guidelines presented in this book, and the results are usable and readable. The procedures will take your team some getting used to -- but the results are worth it. My documentation projects that were overwhelming became manageable."
1,NG for no good,"This record isn't as bad as how sweet it is, but almost. I wish Joan would do an entire record of songs along the lines of Righteous Love and get Rick Rubin to produce it. I'd love that."
3,Newest addition to my Joan Osborne collection,"It's been much too long since Joan released a new cd. This cd is a bit country/twangy but she does a very sweet version of the Dead's Brokedown Palace. This is a nice set to listen to on a late summer afternoon with a glass of wine. Personally, I like my Joan a bit rougher and bluer-nothing compares to her live ""Early Recordings"". This is Joan and her band at their best-I want to FEEL the music as well as hear it."
4,great for the price,"This skateboard is a great board for the price, and is awesome for cruising, and bombing hills. That said, it is rather small and takes some getting used to. Also while it can carve decently, it takes about a week and a half to break in the bushings. A great board if your looking for a board to cruise, but if you are a hasrdcore skater, pay as little more and get a sector 9."
4,Are you pre-determined?,"Basically what I have to say is that if you have this idea in your head before you even listen to it that it's not gonna be great, don't bother.. You'll probably be critical of it.. However, I'd like to say that anyone who's ever listened to Fozzy has to agree that Chris Jericho is a helluva singer.. It's a shame he got stuck doing a lame song.. Lilian Garcia, whom I happen to know personally, has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.. Now, does John Cena have talent? Absolutely.. But he's not the only one with talent on there.. I normally don't even like rappers and I like his stuff.. Keep in mind that most of these people AREN'T singers, so what would you expect?"
3,WWE Originals,"I'd like to start this off by saying I'm a big WWE fan! I watch Smack Down and Raw weekly. I love wrestling so much I bought a Tivo to record everything and anything I could. I thought Originals was okay.The Best songs on there are John Cena ""Basic Thugganomics,"" The Dudleys ""We've Had Enough,"" Kurt Angle ""I don't suck,"" Booker T ""Can You Dig It,"" & Eddy Guerrero "" We Lie, We Cheat, We Steal.""I was very let down by the Rey Mysterio song ""Crossing Borders"" because it reminded me of something Gerrardo or Kid Frost would have done back in the 80's. I also thought all the Stone Cold Steve Austin tracks could have been all combined to make one track and offered a better variety of Superstars.The C.D. is a great concept however it needs improvement. I am 100% satisfied with the purchase only because I'm a huge fan of the superstars."
1,3 Stars For Me,i think this CD is a pretty good Cd to listen to. This was my first wwe cd to have. we listened to it all the time. I liked it so much i brought it to school and someone stole it so i can't listen to it anymore. I say 3 stars because it was good not excellent but not bad. That's my opinion.
4,Very Good Value,"I bought these speakers for my LINUX box. All I wanted was some good cheap speakers. These are very good speakers for the price. The best thing I like about these speakers is that they don't have the BIG transformer as others do, they just have the normal 110V plug. The sound is good for the price range of these speakers, they will never beat my surrond sound speakers, but I didn't buy them for that. The only minus I have about them is that they are black and my LINUX case is off white."
2,"Uniden DXAI5188-2 5.8 GHz Analog Cordless Phone with Dual Handsets, Digital Answering System, and Caller ID (Silver/Black)","I have a lot of static all the timeThe second handset is unusable: after only one minute it simply stops working, so I have to hang up.I'm looking to a possibility to send it back alltogether.I am very disappointed!"
1,Don't Make The Same Mistake,I have a lot of problems with static and phone ranges. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
2,unhappy,"way too small for what i needed it for, i typed in all my info n they said it would work ....BOY WERE THEY WRONG"
2,not the best,"Great product until the tape lost grip. I cleaned the door edges to ensure the tape had proper grip but when summer came around, several places became loose and I had to use marine glue to reattach. Works well for reduction of wind noise (that why I purchased). I added this to the factory weatherstripping on my 2010 4 runner for added noise barrier and installation."
3,I was disappointed.,"This was supposed to be a years supply for my family of 7. Although I doubted it would last that long once the bottles were received, I would have been content if it would have lasted 6 months. However, out of 12 bottles we have already used four in just 8 weeks. Although I love buying green, I need something that works great so I don't have to use a bunch. I have had to rewash so many dishes with this soap, it's a waste of water. I have even bought special scrubbers, still no help. I never had this much trouble using Dawn or even Joy! I will not buy this product again."
5,Awesome T.V.,I had never owned a LCD T.V. before so I spent weeks researching it. I had a limited budget and a siz restriction do to my cabinet size. I looked at several and was going to get a Samsung until I saw this one. Picture quality is great and with the 6 different pic sizes you can adjust the screen to what ever your watching. Also it has 3 temp modes. The remote is easy to use and the directions are easy to follow. It is well worth the money.
5,Great TV,"I really like this TV. It's picture quality is great and the sound is excellent for this type of TV. The directions are easy to follow, which is also a plus."
5,A Great TV,"Though only 26"" this TV seems bigger, the HD channels are just stunning, I'm sorry I waited so long to get an HDTV. Easy to set up though you wind up fiddling with the controls for some time to see what they do -- eventually you find the setting that looks best for the majority of shows; you can change the format and ratio to suit any movie's format. I've got my Mac plugged in to the PC port and it works great as a computer monitor, easy to switch modes from TV to PC. Easy to understand remote. Sound defaults are too thin, you need to pump up the bass and treble settings. Nice case, good access to ports though they are not labeled effectively. I would buy Toshiba again."
4,Good diaper cover,"These are great diaper covers. They seemed huge at first until I got the hang of them. They clean easily and dry fast, no special washing required! I think the elastic feels rough, but my little one doesn't seem to mind and there are no marks on her legs from them. These are great diapers for all kinds of cloth, prefolded and fitted diapers."
4,Peters went beyond the biographer's mandate.,"Margot Peters did a good job in reporting the details of Sarton's life and connecting them to Sarton's works. But instead of giving the facts and letting readers evaluate them, she continually judges Sarton and crams her disapproval down the reader's throat. I was especially annoyed by her decree that Sarton was a ""minor writer."" Sarton was clearly hard to live with. Romantic involvement with her was a pathway to pain. But she had important things to say, and she said them well. Had she been a man, the suffering she caused her friends and lovers would be taken for granted as the artist's privilege, and forgiven for the sake of the work. I didn't know her, but I know her work, and for its contribution to my life, I'd forgive her anything."
3,Amazing and tender history,"Whatever you are, if you understand spanish, will enjoy this comedy regarding two old and caring sisters who start to steal in order to sustain themselves and a little girl that somebody left outside their home. Along several comic episodes, the two sister worked with different kind of people;one beautiful artist, a general of the Mexican Revolution, and others, in order to steal and make their living. But they are so cute and inocent, that you can't blame on them. However, one of the sister made a mistake and she is discovered and must go to jail,before a trail.( a laughing trial) Sara Garcia and Prudencia Grifel, the most famous grandmothers of the mexican movies, are the principal actresses of the picture. Higly recomended to spent a wonderful time!!"
5,The creator from the equator does it again,"This cd marks where the entire world must admit that lee perry is the music! The creator of reggae and dub music reinvents himsself once again in this highly underappreciated release. The problem is many of the old upsetter fans are not keen enough to enjoy the flurry, power, and wit demonstrated on such tracks as ""thunder and lightning"" and ""nasty spell"". And many of the jungle fans of the world have never even heard of lee perry so they don't even realize he is jungle music! This album went virtually unnoticed by the masses in 1995. But five years later this exciting and ground breaking album is more enjoyable than ever. Buy it and DANCE<DANCE<DANCE"
2,buy something else...,"...possibly the 1st Ska Parade disc. It's a lot better. The best song on this Ska Parade is The Equators Song with Angelo Moore. ""Ready Steady Go"" is a cover of a generation X song from the 70's. Buy one of their CDs instead. This CD works as background music when you aren't really listening to it."
3,gas can spout,this gas can spout is really flimsy and the neck does not bend very well. it will break if you try to flex the spout. poorly made.
3,had to get for a mba class,"this book met my professor's requirements, but I'm not a marketing major so I can't say much more then that."
1,Don't buy!,"When I got these and installed them I felt like I just finished installing my home theater system! There are so many wires to this 2.1 system! Unnecessary! Plus, the speakers hiss when nothing is playing, even when they're turned off! Altec Lansing generally have good products but I don't know where they went wrong with this one."
1,Not received.,"I can't write a review of the item because even though I received an email that it was mailed, it never arrived. I later received another email saying that the order couldn't be filled. How can that be....it was sent....but it couldn't be filled????"
1,wrong,"IT is sad to watch Meg Ryan portray this role with her bad Lip job. Bad acting, this movie is worth watching only in terms of learning through the negative."
1,Land of Endless Drivel,"Poor plot, dialogue and acting clutter this emotional time-bomb. Throughout the film, the usually likeable Adam Brody comes across as a whiny sap, while Meg Ryan appears in need of a refresher course in acting. Bad editing partially plays a role in the downfall of this film, extending scenes with pointless banter, and clipping dialogue that seems to be important. Honestly, when you're done watching this movie, it's hard to figure out what truly went wrong. The pieces don't connect and the characters are not believable or likeable. Even the talented Olympia Dukakis appears lost in this mess. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,In the land of Boredom,"This was not what I thought it was going to be. It's just your typical melodrama, packed with ample amounts of bad acting, over acting, casual homophobic slurs and very boring.This is one of those Warner Bros. Assembly line formula flicks. No wonder I'd hardly heard of it before picking it up in a dollar bin.. Not even worthy of a single viewing."
5,It was a pleasure,"This book kept me on the couch totally absorbed and turning pages. I don't want to give any of it away but if this was required reading in high school many more students would come to love reading and the history of the book is just as interesting. Go ahead spend the day with these characters, you won't be sorry."
1,Disappointed,"After reading Stein's how-to books on writing, I was impressed. However, after reading his novel, The Magician, I was left scratching my head. Several of the opening pages are nothing but narrative, boring narrative, at best. There was no ""starting the story in the middle of something,"" as suggested in his how-to books. Just a long droll through an old town with snow and ice and a setting of meloncholy. Once inside the story I didn't get a sense of adversarial dialogue as Stein suggests that all beginning writers to do.The story was technically good but---and maybe it has something to do with its time period---I found its diction disappointingly ironic from such a brilliant teacher on writing.To be fair, I'll try reading more of his fiction work."
2,Recipes all designed for MALE dieters,"I was very much looking forward to a restricted-carb diet for vegetarians, but found this diet extremely difficult to figure out. Definitely don't buy this book the night before you intend to start it (as I stupidly did), as it will take you a few hours to understand how the plan works, and you will almost certainly need to go shopping for some esoteric foods (""stevia extract,"" I'm looking at you).My biggest problem with this book, however, is that all the recipes are designed to give ""4-block"" portions, which is the standard portion for men. The standard portion for women is only 3 blocks--so if you are a woman on this diet, you will have to do some ridiculous divisions (ie, 2-2/3 teaspoons of olive oil x .75) in order to get the recipes to work.On the plus side, the plan seems to be much more reasonable than other low-carb diets, and contains lots of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products."
2,Gotta love tofu!!!,"If you can eat tofu for breakfast, lunch and dinner then this book is for you!! I am a vegetarian and cannot stomach the thought of eating that much tofu! Albeit the book had some very good information! I felt the meals were not really something I could commit to at all. You would have to be extremely dedicated to follw this plan."
4,A good erotic thriller,"This movie was good. That's all I can say for it. A blindfold/handcuff rapist is on the loose, while a woman and her husband play sex games on the advice of her therapist. Really, I feel Shannen Doherty fails to generate much steam, since her acting is of rather limited range anyway. But, still, it's worth it, if you're a fan of erotic straight-to-video or Red Shoe Diaries-reminescent softcore thrillers."
5,A marvelous album!,"I can attest that this CD is wonderful. It has terrific music from one end to the other. I had the pleasure of seeing Salamander Crossing in Vergennes, VT, where they played a number of songs from the CD. The final cut, ""The New Madera Waltz,"" is hauntingly beautiful. You will not grow tired of this CD any time soon."
2,horrible,"i don't know what i was expecting, but it certainly was not this. these are very tiny. none of my crayfish types would eat them, and only my rcs (red cherry shrimp) would touch them, but only if they hadn't eaten in 2 days. i don't know what these are meant to feed, but if you have crayfish or shrimp don't bother with these. buy hikari crab cuisine."
5,WOW...,"This is the album that forever changed my idea of what music can be! Mad Professor and friends use digital technology to the utmost, weaving a awe-inspiring range of sound samples together in a mindblowing display of jungle dub PRESSURE. Buy this album. 'Nuf said."
2,Not for lefties,"This knife is probably great for all of you right handers. Unfortunately for us lefties, the clip is IN THE WAY, and cannot be switched to the other side unless you drill your own holes. That's right....NO predrilled holes on the other side. I'm also disappointed that the Speedsafe trigger along the back (like the one on the scallion, cyclone, leek, etc.) is not present on this knife. The only opening option is the thumb stud, and I'll have to move this over to the other side, as it's also only present on one side. Otherwise, nice knife. I'm pretty disappointed with this knife for those reasons."
1,Not suitable for glass,"I agree with the other reviewer of this product. We use this in our office where we have plenty of glass surfaces and honestly it doesn't work to clean glass. It leaves a very nasty white streak, very similar to something greasy. The only way I was able to remove some of the residue was with a very dry paper towel and even then it did not work.I also agree that it has a great scent, and very pleasant to use, as well as a strong cleaner for other surfaces, but that's about it. I do not recommend it for glass since it leaves a white film over the glass and it does not come off. Unfortunately the only thing that worked for us was white vinegar dissolved in water and we cleaned the glass tables with newsprint or whatever left over newspaper we have for the day. That works wonders and can also be classified as ""going green."""
1,weak and cheap,"On the second day after my purchase I was changing clothes and my Journey Diamond Pendant that I was wearing on this chain just fell on the floor, I picked it up to see what had happened and the chain had broken right in the middle, not at the clasp. Luckily I was at home at the time and felt it fall, otherwise I would have lost my diamond pendant. This was a waste of my money, it was cheap and very poorly made. As a backup, I had ordered two chains that same day, I am still wearing the second one."
5,Wow nice product super fast shipping!,"I received this product 3 days after I ordered, so nice for non Amazon shipped!- Perfect condition- Thanks so much!"
3,Disappointing,"I had fond memories of Underdog from my childhood in the 1960s. Some memories are best left alone. Upon viewing the various episodes with more mature eyes, I was surprised to find the content flat and totally uninteresting. My own children were bored before the end of the first episode. The DVD content and quality were good--no quibble there. Sadly, Underdog's crude animation, stilted dialogue, and cardboard plots don't hold up in the world of the Simpsons or even Sponge Bob Squarepants. If you enjoyed Underdog as a child, only buy this set if you are prepared to have your fond memories taken from you."
5,"um, i thought the guide was pretty good.","I spent 5 days in Madrid last August and found this book to be a useful guide. it will lead you to a good time in madrid, which consists of going to the museums, a bull fight and eating a lot. also, i recommend going to one of the sherry bars mentioned in the book."
1,Super RipOff,"Ron Thompson is one of the most underrated musicians in the country. From his days as a Bay Area staple, to the present in the Central Valley, he has always been one of, if not the best independent musician out there. And on top of all that, he is a genuine nice guy. He has NOT authorized this CD, nor does he get one penny in royalties. Bottom line...DO NOT BUY IT!!! Help Ron out by buying his real stuff. Thanks"
1,Shame On Amazon,"Why is this ""unauthorized"" CD being sold on Amazon in the first place? This is just SO wrong. Definetly not fair to Ron. I would hope that Amazon would use a little bit more discretion when allowing people to sell items on their site or is it all about profit? Come on Ron, get some MP3 Downloads out there and give people a real choice. If this DWEEB can do it, so can you. And I for one, would rather you recieved the royalties you so justly deserve. GBY Ron. Looking forward to seeing those real downloads available to us Magic Sam diehards."
2,Misleading title,"Chomsky and Macedo should have known better: the title of their book is misleading. It should of been titled ""Chomsky on Mis-Political Education."" I don't have a problem with Chomsky's political analysis, but I was expecting him to talk more about the public and private school system in this country. He only does this in the first chapter, and then rest of this short book focuses on what Chomsky knows best: domestic and international politics. A better book on this subject is ""Educating the 'Right' Way: Markets, Standards, God, and Inequality,"" by Micheal W. Apple."
1,what you see is NOT what you get,The picture of the item leads you to beleave that you are going to get the 2 spouts but in fact you only get the repait kit. I'm keeping it to use but will look closer the next time I buy something that looks like a good deal. don't like getting screwed like this
2,Not suggested,"I bought this gun from a local sports store for roughly [...]. Now, admittedly I have never actually taken part in any airsofting aside from shooting cardboard targets. I found that after a few weeks of very light usage, the pellets veered sharply to the left after going roughly 15-20 feet. It had an average of between 250-270 fps when i bought it (there was no label on the box of this, I simply had an experienced airsofter and friend guesstimate), and I had a minor problem with the side rail being difficult to adjust (admittedly, this last flaw is hardly worth noting). I personally would suggest that you choose another gun!"
1,Beware the Leavening of the Pharisees and intellectuals,"I borrowed this from the library, and feel it is hostile to the Word of God, and teaches heresies about Jesus. Either the Bible is all true, inspired of God, and God cannot lie - or God DID lie, and the book is a collection of myths and legends, sprinkled with some interesting history and commentaries by men. In that case, we may as well study the Odyssey or Dune. However, if you WANT to know and grasp the dangerous subversion being promoted in Catholic colleges, seminaries, and other places, you should listen to this. It is articulate, and nicely filmed. Frankly, it made me ill, and I could not finish it. Of course, the anti-fundamentalists will praise this work...as would the Pharisees."
1,This video is misleading.,Don't buy this video it is misleading it argues with the Word Of God. The Word of God is the only truthfull source we can rely on and don't ever forget it. Jesus was a carpenter not a stone cutter. Lies lies lies what is the world coming too. This video is a waste of money. This video has be inspired by non-believer's. The A&E did a terrible thing to allow this movie to be made it is all lies. As it has been said' Their is no truth in a lie. Jesus died for are sin's. I don't care if you believe me this is the truth I know it and feel sorry for you if you don't. But if you don't great. Jesus is coming again be ready.
5,Excellent guide to an amazing hiking area.,"I hiked for 3 days in the Jordanian Dead Sea Rift using a guide and this book. If I had known about this book (the guide loaned it to me), I would not have needed the guide. It is excellent and unlocks to all readers this amazing hiking area. My favorite hikes be far were the ones up the ""wadis"" (Canyons) -- cool narrow canyons where the trail is a clear, cool stream. I am eager to return to Jordan to hike many more of the described hikes. Best for the hikes along the Dead Sea Rift. Also has hikes near Petra and two at Wadi Rum. Wonderful book despite its steep price."
4,Change over time in a colonial capital,"In what is today's Antigua in Guatemala, Santiago de Guatemala, 1541-1773: City, Caste, and the Colonial Experience is a study of urban demographics and social change over time. In the first phase, the separation of the two ""republics"" is indicated by the Spanish core surrounded by the indigenous barrios. What follows is the rise of a racially mixed population of gente ordinaria leading to a large middle group of people ""increasingly homogenized in both socioracial and cultural terms."" (157) As this casta grew in size it took over the barios. The Indian and Spanish sectors of the ""republics"" gave way to the interaction of people living in close proximity to each other. The author makes use of a valuable cross-index file created by Don Josaquin Pardo at the Archivo General de Centroamerica (AGCA) in Guatemala City."
4,"beautiful book, well written","I saw the early draft of this book and it is GREAT. Ricki has written this book with a pure love for Transformers. The pictures are nice, big, clear and beautiful. New and old Trasnformer fans will be very pleased."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this book,Author doesn't have anything in this book which not already available free of cost on the internet. It was a total waste of my time and money procuring and reading this book. May be useful to people who can't search items on their own online. Admire the market who knew how to title useless books like these!!
4,Half the price of the manufacturer cost...works great for everyday!,I purchased this machine for our church. It works great for everyday use! Saves time by not having to hand fold everything!Half the cost from the original Manufacturer! Which...I loved!
2,"Huge fan of the series, but was dissapointed.","First off I have to say that I love this series of music. I think that it is a great idea and most of them are well done. I am afraid to say though that this one isn't as well done. Most PF fans will enjoy the novelty of this cd but it just didn't translate well to the lullabye style. I found that this cd isn't very relaxing to listen to and noticed that the music would wake my baby up more than put her to sleep, not to mention myself as I heard it over the baby monitor."
2,floating lights,They worked two times then they stopped don't light up at all now and they don't float very well.
3,Awesome,"I love these little flowers. You do need quite a few to have the right effect, but after ordering the original two packages of these flowers, I turned around and ordered more. They are so pretty and I love the way they light up our pool. I only gave a three star rating because I would have liked them to light up the pool more."
5,Very Cute,I am a huge fan of beanie babies and when I saw this I thought it was really cute. Its even cuter in person than in the picture.
5,CHAIR,"The chairs are just as pictured. very sturdy and nice. The seat pad will be easy to re-do, to match any decor."
2,Not Good.,"In all honesty these people don't do Shania's music any justice at all. The production is pretty good throughout and the person who covered You're Still The One was a decent effort so I will give it 2 stars but the rest leave little to be desired and just can't cut singing Shania's songs with the same amount of energy, charisma, heart, soul, attitude and passion as the goddess herself.Forget this tripe and just get Shania's Greatest Hits instead."
1,Not for any brass or any loud instrument,"Like the previous reviewer, I too find the metronome to be too quiet, at least for a trumpet player. The volume is turned up full but I still cannot hear it.I question the accuracy of the tuner. My current trumpet is of the low-end, and I suspected it of playing a little flat, but the tuner tells me it's at least one full step below. Based on my neighbor's piano, it's not THAT flat.Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,I expected more!,"I used a former version of this product (Professional and it was amazing!). However, Express is very limited and does not give me any flexibility. Unfortuanately, the Professional version is no longer on the market- they do not compare. I do not recommend."
3,My Label Designer Deluxe,Correction: My Label Designer Deluxe (actual software title as per Avanquest (current owner of MySoftware)) is for Windows NOT mac/unix/linux (will marginally run in linux/Wine but tends to self-destruct if you try to set/change label size).
1,The Book That Has No Editor...,"I purchased this book based on the posted reviews. While I have immense respect, admiration and envy for what they were able to do, the book is very nearly unreadable. The author writes in short, simple, dull sentences, that become irritating after a few pages. I tried a number of times to read the book, because I am very interested in what happened, but I can't get past poor writing and (apparently) no professional editing.Additional comment made 1/24/07:If you are planning to purchase this book I have a request. Please go to the option that lets you see inside the book and click ""Surprise Me"". This will give you an random page from the book. Please read this page and ask yourself if you would enjoy reading over 300 pages in this same writing style. I wish I had done that before I ordered the book."
2,very plain,"I agree with the previous post Im currently reading the book. I do want to find out what happens on the trip, however the writing style is very generic. No descriptions the author will simply say ""the people from each village wore different colored dresses to represent each village"" not descriptive at all. The style is like something that would be written by an elementary school student."
4,"Gorgeous, not the sturdiest","Pros: Looks more expensive than it is, has a great vintage style, sits well around the neck, is easily adjustable.Cons: Is exactly as durable as you'd expect for the price.This necklace made it through my wedding day (and looked great), but some of the rhinestones came out during the reception. I was trying not to spend hundreds of dollars on my wedding jewelry, and this was the perfect solution. I would recommend this if you just need it for a special event, but I don't think you can wear it again and again."
4,Very beautiful!,This Necklace was bought so I can wear on my wedding day. It was delievered fast and in a beautiful box. It looks beautiful on me. I am so excited to wear it on my Big day. I wish It were real Silver so that I may be able to use it as a family heirloom. But for the price and the qulaity it has been well worth it.
2,thumbs down,Taking this stuff i'm unable to get more than 4 hours of sleep a night. so much for recovery. it did nothing for my legs after a long day of mountain biking.
3,Now Foods ZMA,"I really like Now Foods products. But I can't conscientiously give this product a good grade. It's suppose to increase your Testosterone levels, but I have yet to see any real results. I have no intentions of buying another bottle. I gave it three stars because it has Magnisium and Zinc."
4,Not a Bad Source for Trivia Nights and That Type of Thing,"This no pictures or glossy paper phone book sized reference book certainly contains a substantial number of movies. To its credit as well, unlike a lot of its there is no world outside of the USA competitors it does venture outside of North America and includes movies made in the UK, Australia and other places as well so it actually is a comprehensive collection. Of course like its competitors it does not include every movie ever made so your favourites may well not be in here. There isn't a book out there that does and this provides a brief summary of the movie, the actors, studio, directors and producers as well as other key staff. It also provides opinions on a lot of the movies and again obviously you're not going to agree with them all. If you need a book for trivia nights and that type of thing then this will surely suffice."
5,"Oh no, it's sold out!","I've ordered so many products that were earth friendly, but didn't meet my needs (actually useless). This product works PERFECTLY. I was amazed and came back to order another case (bottles are small and not totally filled), but it is no longer available ;-( I'd suggest you buy it if it becomes available or go to another merchant as it's that effective."
5,Amici going from strength to strength,"AMICI FOREVER ARE THE ORIGINAL OPERA BAND - all others are just 'pretenders to the title'.I have just read the review by Bob - to clarify this Special Edition is the same as the original version with a couple of added extra tracks - hence Special Edition so there obviously is not much of a difference!!Having said that, the extra tracks are beautiful, but Amici are best appreciated live on stage where you can really appreciate their individual styles, which then blend together.If you want to hear different tracks then buy Defined there second Original Album and not a re-issue as is this Special Edition Opera Band.There is now talk of a 3rd Album which I await in anticipation."
1,nope.,I also had the overcooked/soupy batter problem. The pan shape just doesn't work well for baking. Unfortunate.
4,Smaller than expected,"The pan looks adorable but be warned it is smaller than you would think. Instructions say it serves 12 and while it does use one whole cake mix, the shape of the pan makes it hard to cut 12 equal pieces. Great for a small group but if you're looking for something that will feed 12 I would try something else, perhaps the larger Wilton cupcake cake pan."
3,Didn't work for me!,Received product timely. The product did help but I was still retaining a lot of water. I think my needs exceeded this particular products capabilities.
1,Did not work,"This product did not work for meI followed the direction's like stated on bottle. It say's you will see results in 3 days. I tried it for up to 8 days and no change in body weight. The only difference I felt was from the caffeine. I was up all not night. I felt tired and sluggish.I did extensive research on natural diuretic like dandelion, green tea. This product has natural herbs in there but it didn't work. Although it has these ingredients like dandelion it doesn't work. You Are probably better off buying dandelion at the local health food store or sitting in a sauna. Save your money."
2,Disappointing,"My mother gave this to me for my birthday and I'm sorry I can't return it. I guess I'm old fashioned, but I like turning to a book on my shelf and rummaging through the pages for a good hike. My hiking books are like old friends and the worn pages are like well earned battle scars. Consulting a computer screen really leaves me cold."
5,Excellent video by one of the greatest singers of the 20th century.,"I saw this on PBS some years ago, and having grown up listening to country music (when it was still country music), I was well aware of who Tennessee Ernie Ford was. This video is well worth the price and includes some standards as well as some of the classic carols sung by one of the best baritones in the business, then and now. The song listing is included with the case insert and is indexed as well on the DVD. It is made very entertaining by both Ford's down home manner and is especially memeorable by the antics of one of his children during a live performance. I like listening to people who can sing, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days, and I highly recommend this video to everyone."
4,Early Judy,"This was the first Judy Collins album I've purchased that predated ""Judy Blue-eyes"". Its easy to hear how she's developed. Highly reccomend if you're a Judy Collins fan already. If not, start w/Judy Blue-eyes."
2,Not that great,"This calendar is printed in black and white on rough paper. The pages tend to tear off unevenly. I don't find most of the quotes particularly helpful. Needless to say, I won't purchase one next year."
4,Fine motor coordination in a creative way,"This product was deliver on time (as always). It requiered more fine motor coordinatiod than other assembling toys tha I had. I don't know what the monkeys have, but a child would climb an inestable surface just to play this game."
5,Fun for all,"My son received this as a gift when he turned 4, and we all love this game. Slightly educational since you learn about balance, and different strategies for hanging monkeys. But mostly it is fun. The magnet is a great design idea.ONE RULE SUGGESTION: add a penalty if you knock the monkeys down (like you need to ""take back"" one monkey into your pile), otherwise people might knock down the monkeys on purpose. Still, no matter what you do, it is fun."
1,Ultimate Bore,"A friend and I are preparing for a trip to Mexico and I purchased this DVD thinking it would provide video footage and appealing ( educational and quirky?) insight into Mexico. The film footage was from the 3rd Century - edited in without attempting to change the dated color or create some semblance of context. Ian Wright spent most of his time lying on the side of the road waiting for ""fun"" - as if, we too were going to relish his hitch hike to hell. I would love to say that there was an element of camp - or anything worthy of passing this DVD on to fellow travelers, but it was poorly written, filmed, edited, and way too much money for such a lifeless production! Next time I will definitely pass on Globe Trekker DVD's as a source of inspiration for travel."
3,"great price per cell, but still rank near bottom","Here's another indep review, with tests for taking images & constant current consumption. Again, the Lenmar 2000 ranks at or near the bottom.http://www.techchallenge.com/page2.htmlThe Rayovac 2000 averages 153 images per charge, while the Lenmar 2000 averages 90 images.For constant current the Rayovac 2000 averages 56.1 minutes, while the Lenmar 2000 averages only 28.7 minutes.Bottom line is that you'll pay less for the Lenmar but would have to charge them more."
3,"Not for ""American"" style cake decorators","This book is more for someone who makes European style cakes and already has the knowledge of fondant and gumpaste. Instructions would not be easy to follow for beginners, especially since the wording is European, hence the title ""Sugarpaste"". The cakes in this book, while most of them very pretty, are all fondant with ribbons and painting on them. The designs seem mostly to be for a pretty look and not a creative or ""stand out"" look."
3,Enjoyable Illustration of Classic American Folk Song,"Good book for children 3-8 that can be sung to children, as the music score is included at the back of the book. It's nice becasue this book provides good illustrations to the song, when sung by itself, could leave young minds wondering and confused."
5,Brilliance from beginning to end.,"This album really should have been big. There's really nothing not to like about it. If I were to characterize it stylistically, I would have to say, ""Nine Inch Nails meets the B-52's."" The sound is hard but playful, with an abundance of experimentation characteristic of either of the aforementioned bands. Meatplow was also one of the few bands I've heard with a sense of humor that didn't render it inane and an angry edge that didn't render it pretentious or brain-dead. Basically, if you enjoy the kinda-sorta industrial NIN sound but find Trent Reznor's pseudo-spookiness annoying, then this is the perfect album."
2,Good movie pity it didn't follow the book.,"I did enjoy this movie. However I don't believe it is entitled to have the title of ""Her Own Rules"" as it didn't follow the book. Also it would have been 100% better if the writers of the movie didn't change events that happened to Mari in the book which in the movie happen to her mother. I have seen other books by Barbara Taylor Bradford converted to movies and this would have to be the worst one for not following the book."
5,Jeep Bikini Top,Excellent top! This is the first time I've had a bikini top on my jeep and I will use it most of the time. It is great here in San Antonio where we get a lot of sunny days. You still get the air blowing around but not all of the heat from the sun. Great!
3,adequate personal graphics editor,"I have accumulated a number of graphics editors that came bundled with various graphics products, and some with Windows itself. Of all of these I have found PhotoImpact to be the most useful, although it has a number of flaws and inconveniences (ie: having to click Edit and scroll down to crop every time you want to crop a photo gets old quickly). Unfortunately, uLead itself leaves a great deal to be desired - the ""free"" downloads and trial versions require many attempts at download; an email I sent to their tech support was never answered, etc"
5,This is the way to get published - it works!,"I cannot thank Richard Curtis enough for this book. I'm not a reader of self-help books as a rule, but this one I underlined. My publisher - chosen with Curtis' instructions in mind - said he'd never seen a cleaner copy than my manuscript.When I walked into my attorney's office with the list - Curtis"" list - of the things I wanted to see in my contract, my attorney said, ""You've been doing your homework!""Thank you, Mr. Curtis; I'm a fan from the earliest edition, and I just bought 2003's.A.D. Slade"
5,I KNOW THIS GUY,"This book is great. I mean, I know the author personally. He's such a great guy. we were college roommates back in the day. I remember him getting the book published, now it's on Amazon.com. That's insane!!! Way to go Buck!"
4,i love young love,it really took me to a kind of place where i wish i spent my teens. it was hard not to feel good through even the worst of times.
1,Cute item.. if it worked.,"I wouldn't waste your money on buying this.. mine broke after two weeks in a dry room tempature place. Meaning, it wasn't because I got water in it because its a ""shower"" radio.. I never tested that out but if I did it would of probably broke even sooner. I'm very disappointed :("
1,What was Caldecott thinking?,"I have never written a review before but was so disappointed with this book I felt compelled to this time. Don't be fooled by the attractive artwork, this story is incomprehensible to kids and adults.If you are looking for a bedtime book, pick something else or be prepared for questions about naked children being baked in ovens."
1,weird stoner kids book,"By my math, this came out seven years after Where the Wild Things Are. On the basis of this book I can only assume that Maurice was stoned on some very expensive and powerful weed in 1970."
2,Why?,"It sounds interesting, kind of fun to give it a listen yourself... But for your baby? All the songs here are ""safe"", just make a playlist of the real Radiohead songs for your baby. Why not? It's not as if they're raucous, or have a bunch of swearing."
1,Get your kids the real thing,"I love the idea of introducing little ones to grand music from a grand band, and the song choices on this album are perfect, but not only are these instrumentals lame and boring, but they very much remind true Radiohead fans how good the real thing would be for kids and even babies. Songs such as ""Subterranean Homesick Alien"" and ""No Surprises"" are PERFECT lullabies in their original Radiohead form, so how about parents wising up and playing Radiohead for their kids rather than children's junk, with this album being included in the ""children's junk"" category."
1,Ok for babies but not for Radiohead fans,"I purchased this album bc i heard a snippet of the ""paranoid android"" cover on NPR one afternoon. That's really the only track on this album i can stomach, and i consider myself to be one of the most serious Radiohead fans around. I also happen to be a musician, and I can tell you that the guy who arranged and performed the songs on this album did a pretty lame job. The recording is dull and flat-sounding. It may have turned out better if they'd had several musicians perform and record together, rather than just one dude recording each track and subsequently layering them. The album sounds pretty, but that's because almost anything sounds pretty when it's arranged for vibraphone or glockenspiel. This album is not disgustingly bad by any means--it's tolerable, and if i had a baby i might play the album for the child ""just because."""
5,...This is the coolest thing ever.,"So, I'm obviously not an infant, but I have to say- I LOVE THIS CD. It's complete genius. I love Radiohead, and these lullaby renditions of their songs are very soothing and sweet-sounding. I like falling asleep listening to music, and this CD definitely does the trick.Can't wait for the Pink Floyd one to be available!"
4,Great lullabye option when you're sick of Brahms,"I got the Radiohead and Cure Rockabye Baby CDs before my daughter was born. I thought at best they'd be a novelty but I'm very pleasantly surprised. They're not meant to be amazing interpretations of these songs - they're lullabyes for a baby. My baby is actually soothed by the songs and they're such a great alternative to Brahms and other typical baby lullabyes. Two of these Rockabye Baby CDs are plenty - I created a playlist of lots of quiet mood music (Air, Beatles, Elliot Smith, etc) just for the baby and that works just as well. No need to get the whole collection when there's plenty of everyday music that can be used in the nursery."
3,SUCK IT UP,"This is definitely a kids' movie and one that may be difficult for adults to sit through. The animals in the forest not only understand English but are well versed in the laws of physics and automobile operation. The Japanese boss is unmercifully stereo-typed. Animals attack Fraser, who is leading the way to destroy their habitat for the ""green"" company he works for, except no one but him sees the animals.Eventually the animals let out a full assault on the humans. Extremely kid friendly as no animal dies in the movie. The message is that companies which claim to be green are not really green. It would be a good movie to watch along with some BP ads. There is some toilet humor. Most of the humor is of the slapstick variety, with maybe one joke aimed at adults.How many Daily Show stars can you identify in cameo roles?"
2,They just mailed this one in.,It's harmless entertainment for a four year old but mostly intolerable for mom and dad.
5,Good fun,"Very entertaining book, gets you hooked on the author. I will be reading more. Protagonist extremely likeable and entertaining. Makes you laugh out loud."
5,Buy it elsewhere,"I've been waiting 2 months for 2 Laurel Burch mugs from Amazon - this one and Fantastic Cats. This one was removed from my order as unavilable, yet is still listed as available here. Buy them elsewhere and save yourself the time and trouble."
5,STILL POCO MUSIC,"What a great CD. Even though it has a religious theme, the music and his voice are pure Poco. So even if religious songs are not your thing, you'll still enjoy this CD, and while you'll listening check out the lyrics. They may just touch you like you've never been touched before. Thanks Richie for all the great music over the years."
4,Great!,"I'm a diehard Tool fan, and after listening to the samples I was compelled to buy this album. Even if you don't have kids, I recommend this record to any tool fan. It's a great spin on their music, and if you DO have kids, it'll help them develop a good taste in music early on :)"
3,Not For Just Any Beginner,"I rated this book a 3. I thought the instructions were not clear and somewhat hard to understand. I don't like going back to a page to get part of the instructions and then to another to finish the task.Back and forth page flipping is not for me. I had to piece together the instructions myself to get a full picture of what I needed to do to get the projects completed. I'm at the top of beginner and bottom of intermediate in my skills, so I know the basics and a little more. I think a true beginner would have trouble using this book. Pictures were nice, font used was easy to read."
3,Cute patterns but not for beginners,"I really like the patterns, but the directions on the more complicated items are really skimmpy. I haven't made anything out of this book yet and I don't need another scarf. I also bought ""knitting for Baby, 30 heirloom projects"". I've started some projects from this book and I don't even have a baby. This is a great beginners book, I got this so I could practice first. hopefully later I can go back to H.T.K. and make something, like a sweater."
4,Easy to read text,I purchased this map for our family to use while stationed over here in Europe. I wasn't too sure how clear the countries would be marked but when I saw the map in person I was more than happy. It is quite large which is great to be able to see the countries around the world and to be able to stick pins in! Enjoy and happy geography~
5,"Loved this book! It was a warm, satisfying read.","I loved the characters, the interaction between the hero and heroine was terrific. The secondary characters were also well-written - the kids were great! Josh is the hero every woman wants. I'm looking forward to more books from this talented author."
3,OUTPUT,"I guess the quality is ok, but its not as bright as the GE H7 I replaced it with, I'll have to go for higher output bulbs next time, shipping slow! but price was ok"
3,Old School Games,Overall the game is great. Perfection takes some time getting used to navigating the pieces around but Connect Four and Trouble are fun and easy.
1,Don't bother,"The F2 error is unfixable and quite common in internet searches; many complaints found. I spent too much money for this to happen. Looking for a new, reliable brand to try now."
4,heating pad,I have athritis and I have pain in my left leg especially at night so the pad really helps. sometimes the 2 hour shut off wakes me up and I restart it. This is a good safety device even though sometimes it frustrates me.
2,Heating pad,"I think it is overpriced for what it is but it does work to some extent. There really isn't much heat from the ""magic coils"" -- whatever. Would I buy it again -- NO."
3,Not Hot Enough,Although a versatile aid I find it doesn't heat as well as older pads that I have owned in the past
5,up and down,"I love this song. The remixes are good. I can actually withstand listening to this cd, like a regular album. If you're a fan of this song, pick up 'The Party Album'...it has this song plus 15 others. Recommended."
2,A bit silly,"up and down, and up and down up and down up and and down and down and up and down ARE YOU BORED YET?????"
4,English-German Dictionary,"A little more worn than I expected, but no pages seem to be ripped. Seems that it will be useful for what I need. Arrived on time."
3,pitty,Nice songs (well known songs) in a open air theatre. Personally I think it is pitty that Andrea didn't show country fragments
2,Disappointed,"I highly rate Andrea Bocelli as a fine singer with a beautiful, individual, easy voice. This album in no way does him justice. Is he now trying to be a pop singer?"
5,Well made DVD and good song selection,The scenery is great and together with the voice of Andrea and the song selection makes this combo highly recommended.
5,FINALLY A BREAK FROM THE MONOTONY!,I am in the process of reading the dark series and the writing and stories were getting too repetitive. Finally Feehan brings some life back to this series! After Dark Desire...this is 2nd best!
2,Did her high school daughter help write this?,"I could not believe Dark Symphony was written by the same author as the other Dark series books. True, the themes are similar, and in this book we have what could have been very interesting characters in the blind, but talented Antonietta Scarletti, and in the handsome, but more thoughtful and sensitive Byron. The writing, however, is so uneven, and the descriptions and characters so cardboard, that I thought a high school student might have contributed to this book. The dialogue also is often stilted with so much American slang that I couldn't ever quite believe I was in a mysterious Italian castle with extraordinary individuals, rather than in a shopping mall. Where was her editor???"
4,Wonderful!,"Ms. Feehan is a wonderful storyteller, mixing romance and the paranormal into a wonderful, intriguing tale. I wish there were more authors as good as her and Sherry A. Mauro! Both of my favorite writers!"
1,Disappointing,"I have been a big fan of the Dark Series, but this one really missed the mark. The characters lacked personality & the dialog at times made absolutely no sense. I found myself skimming just to get through some of it. Tying this one in with characters from the Scarletti Curse was a mistake. They were all forgettable in that book also."
2,Dark Symphony,"Feehan writes phenominally creative books and is worth adding to your collection. Dark Symphony is not one of her best books. The story just doesn't draw the reader in as her previous books have. It lacks the edgy exitement, drama, romance that made her books something you just couldn't put down till you finished one. Having said this about Dark Symphony, I will add that I am completely looking forward to her next book and will pre-order it as she is a very talented author."
1,Awful!!!,This was a awful book compaired to the others. I havent even finished it yet. The charecters and the story were boring. This one can definatly be missed.
2,Really Boring,"I was so looking forward to Byron's story, but this book is hardly about him. It spends too much time on the Scarpetti family whose escapades are really ho hum, silly and boring. I barely got through the book with a sigh of relief hoping I never see this family again. My advice, read all the other dark books and skip this one. You won't be missing a thing."
5,Always my favorite,"I loved this book from the first page to the last. I own most of the DARK series in paperback and have started my Kindle collection and could not think of a better Carpathian to start with than Byron. There is no vampire present like the others, but it captivates and makes me want to finish without pause."
4,A little twisted,"This is not typical of Feehan's Dark series, but that in no way diminishes the impact this book has on the series.This book was not all about the passion between the two main characters, it was about history and family and acceptance.Antonietta Scarletti, is blind and rich, and scarred. Can any man love her for herself, or will she always be preyed upon as weak because of the opinion that others have of her.Byron Justicano is alone in his world of darkness because of his self imposed banishment from his people. Can the music Antonietta creates be his salvation?There is an interesting plot twist that I hope will affect future stories, and this interesting little tidbit has got me aching to keep reading more."
1,Not the item pictured,I am returning this product. The product I received is a Preschool Skills Test for ages 3-6. The reviews are for K-3 and grades 4-6. I looked at the images and the image shows for grade 4-6 which is what I thought I was buying. I will be returning this item.
2,This knife had to go back,"I really like the Boa and wanted it for every day carry. The blade lock does not reliably work thus presenting a safety hazard when pocketed. This is a serious flaw, for a spring bar knife, which outweighs its other desirable features.Having said that, the knife is just the right size, weight and features I was looking for in an ""everyday knife"". Had the blade lock failure not presented a safety risk, I would have awarded 5 stars."
4,Good overview of Medieval practices of food.,"This book is nicely organized in how it takes its focus from different Medieval Figures such as: Chaucer, Richard II, and The Goodman of Paris. I like the general overview of someof the cooking habits during the different time periods, butfound myself wanting more information than provided.As for the recipes, I liked that she included the orignaltext of the recipes along with her modernization. However,I found that many of the recipes were significantly changedfrom the original. I feel this does a disservice to theoriginal, for you won't get the same tastes as were intended. Some of her modernizations include ingredientsthat are not mentioned in the original."
4,Good Reasource,"If you are looking for good tasting period recipes, this book is for you. Sometimes cookbooks that have recipes that are from times past offer recipes that taste quite differently than what our modern expectations are. This book will deliver you good recipes. Two of the favorite ones I have tried from this book were the Almond Chicken and the Golden Leeks and Onions. The instructions are very clear, and easy to read. The book does offer lovely art work as well. My only complaint about this book while the recipe that it has are very good, I just with their were more of them. This is a good book to start or even add to a Medieval recipe collection."
2,Not A Good Primer,"If you are looking for a book on Tantra proper, this is not the right book for you. The questions posed are seldom answered in a thorough fashion and there is a negative/catty tone which prevails through the entire book which is rather tiresome.The claim posed by the authors that this is ""the only book on Tantra you will ever need"" is downright ignorant as topics specific to Tantra are only explored in very vague terms. A thorough explanation is sacrificed for the sake of an account of the personal spiritual path pursued by authors.There is a general occult bad-boy-ism employed here that will appear adolescent unless you find yourself profoundly fettered by Judeo-Christian conditioning."
1,Avoid --- contains re-recordings,"I am sick and tired of re-recordings of the old hits. Most people who love the 1950's and 1960's music want the ORIGINAL recordings, period. Do not waste your time on this collection."
2,Very disappointed,"Very cute clock no directions in the box on putting the battery in and very difficult to get into the battery compartment, needless to say I ended up breaking the clock doing so, so it is in the trash!"
3,"definitely ""wild""","This is a great book even though it isn't appreciated as much as it should be. Yes, it is slow paced and the narrative is a little awkward, but the story is endearing and calls to mind the legends and fairy tales of childhood. This book makes you have a greater appreciation for good old fashioned storytelling. Every chapter is fascinating and different than anything you've ever read.If you like long family sagas and delving into the history of a character, then you'll love ""Wildcatting"". One reviewer compared it to ""Giant"". I'd agree but my assessment is the show ""Dallas"" as told by Tim Burton."
4,ROTC - gag gift for corp of cadets,Bought these for our son and Platoon buddies in the Corp of Cadets at Mil College. They got the potatos from mess hall. Very funny and harmless for their Haloween skit with the Rooks.
1,Pay attention to the failures,"All I can say is I've had 3, and they had little use as I am a homeowner not a contractor. All three of them are dead. The drill is wonderful, the batteries are very good, and the one thing that screws the whole 'buy Milwaukee' value equation up and makes the purchase worthless is the charger."
2,They don't last long so buy a couple,"If you own a Milwaukee cordless device and you find these chargers at a good price, buy a couple. They are notorious for going bad. Three guys working on my house have had to purchase new chargers. Mine went south in less than a year. I bought two."
3,Not too impressed,"This book is written in a ""hunt and peck"" style: you have to hunt for useful information and then peck what is feasbile and what is not. I wasn't too impressed, but I guess all publicity books are the same. It's not like there's much new information out there.I do recommend ""Free Publicity"" by Jeff Crilley. ..."
5,A safe alternative to poison,"This product is based on Neem Oil which is a natural oil that comes from the Neem tree in India where it's included in common products like toothpaste. What's great about it is that Neem Oil is non-toxic to humans but deadly to insects.While I've had more dramatic results with chemical pesticides, this product is far safer and I have no problems using it on my vegetables and fruit trees.I summary, it works and it's safe."
2,Can't believe I paid that much money for this book,"I agree with the one-star reviewer. What is so special about this book? I barely managed to finish it and for the first time in my life I put a book IN the box to donate to the Public Library book sale. I can't believe I spent that much money for a lousy paperback, but I chose it based on the high ratings. Don't believe them! If you really want to read it, find a used copy. There are much better storytellers out there."
2,"Great pictures, but otherwise standard","As a fan of Ernie's, I looked forward to reading/viewing this book. The pictures are great, but I found most the instruction to be bog-standard. Nothing new here."
5,"The Perfect heating pad, the BEST ever!!!!","I purchased this pad to use upon my aching shoulders, and lower back.Small pads do not cover both shoulders, or your entire back, and are difficult to hold in place.This pad is a revelation! It is very large, large enough to cover both of my shoulders, or my entire back.The washable heating pad is also a very fine idea. The pad is of a very nice quality, much nicer than I had expected considering the low price.The pad has 4 heat settings, plus an automatic turn-off feature. The pad is MORE than warm enough, indeed , I find myself using the lowest setting ""Warm"", instead of ""High"", as I did on my other (much smaller) heating pads.I highly recommend this well-made, large heating pad to everyone with sore shoulder, or lower back pain."
2,works ok when it feels like it,"I have had both good and bad luck with this heating pad. Some days, it will stay on the hottest setting for a couple hours. Other days, I will have it turned on for 5-10 minutes and it will automatically turn off. You have to unplug it and plug it back in before you can turn it on again. SO ANNOYING WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO RELAX. I do wish that the hottest setting was a bit hotter, but it's been fairly acceptable for me (if it decides to stay on for longer than 10 minutes.) I will be buying a different heating pad."
3,Very small knife,"This knife comes with a very nice blade, It holds an edge well. The spring assist opening works well. The handle is very tiny in my hand and the blade is even smaller. It works great for opening packages, but I don't think it would work well for a daily carry."
3,not the best kershaw,"I wanted a small quality knife to carry around and possibly attach to my keys. I already own the Kershaw Blur, which is an awesome knife so I decided to try the smaller models. I ordered Chive and LFK (which costs almost a third) to see which one worked better for me.Chive turned out to be way smaller than I thought, and kind of pointless as an EDC or a keychain knife. It is almost a toy version of the Leek. Speedsafe is useless since the knife is so tiny and difficult to grip. There is also a safety on the handle to prevent it from opening up accidentally, which defeats the purpose of Speedsafe. This knife could easily open by accident so not using the safety would is a bad idea. Mine was also somewhat defective as it only opened half way most of the time. Also, a clip is pointless on a knife this small. LFK, on the other hand, turned out to be an awesome little knife. It is a bit larger than Chive, has no clip, and is easy to open and close."
3,Beautiful Knife But......,"The Chive is a beautiful looking knife, functions well as others have described, but in my opinion has one disturbing flaw. oil from my fingers makes this knife a bit too slippery for my taste. I cut myself 2 times handing the slick finish. I haven't tried to handle the knife when wet. A finish like the Cryo knife by Kershaw would be better and offers more friction, or another a glass filled grip with texture.Yesterday i ordered the Scallion which is a little larger knife. I am staying away from any anodized finish. I opted for the nylon with texture for better grip."
2,Not for the very serious,"I need to learn precalculus for a CLEP exam and gave this a try. Its not for the serious learner at all. The skits are really over the top and in between them they put out a problem that they solve so quickly without explaining how they got the answer. If you really need to be taught the subject and not entertained I recommend something else. Maybe this is for some people, but not the really serious that really need more instruction and less drama."
5,"Homes of Honor: Hidden Keys to Successful Parenting, by Dr. Gary Smalley","This video series covers topics like:1. Discovering what type of parent you are.2. Discovering your child's personality type.3. Overcoming the major destroyer of families.4. Providing loving support to your child.5. Contracts: Setting limits in a loving way.6. Developing a close-knit family.7. Ten powerful ways to motivate your children.8. Using the ""SALT"" principle to encourage communication.Gary, in his very humorous but effective manner, teaches you how to move out of the two parenting styles that can produce devasting, long-range consequences, and move into the parenting style that produces the most stable and fulfilled children. Excellent resource.Includes 2 VHS video tapes and workbook."
4,Nice with a couple of complaints,"I purchased this to place two gardens in my kitchen for my wife. The set up was fairly easy and the included template worked fine. The overall look is nice and it fits the gardens perfectly and the bases are very sturdy. I have no stability concerns and it looks good. I only placed the bottom two bases on the wall and then put the ""topper"" on. I will likely add a third later.My three complaints are 1) the metal backs look good but a fairly thin metal and are easily bent. In fact one had an edge bent when I unpacked it. 2) The fit of the backs is less than perfect, however the joins are hidden by the aerogardens. 3) the bottom peice is supposed to attach to a tab, but there is no tab there. It stays without difficulty, but after checking all three bases, there is definately no tab to attach to and it is not as secure as the rest of the peices.None of these would cause me to return it, and my wife and I think it looks great, but they were enough to drop it a star."
4,attractive and functional,"The shelves were very easy to install and since the 2007 review the screws and the electrical strip must have been upgraded because the screws were very strong and the plugs easily went into the wall. My reason for giving it four stars is that the height of the lights are considerably restricted. The top shelf would be able to extend to the full height, the other two can only extend one level beyond the starting level. That height restriction seems to be a considerable concern (I just installed mine). My previous basil and herb plantings ended up needing full extension. We'll see how it goes with lots of pruning.Not hard to install; a stud finder essential."
4,Vengaboys refresh the tired standards of house music.,"I first heard this track while shopping for shoes in London back in March and was immediately moved. I spent the entire duration of the track dancing on the stairs of a Kensington clothing store, much to the irritatiion of the management other shoppers, but the point is, Vengaboys have reclaimed the fundamental soul of house music. Check out this track."
3,Good guide.,"Just returned from a trip to Sonoma and Mendocino counties. This book was an excellent guide and I really liked the maps detailing where everything was. Of course things change and places close or move - we only had one ""surprise,"" when we went to Hidden Cellars and learned they'd been bought by Parducci and were now in that tasting room instead.Otherwise, this book is terrific to have along. I recommend looking at websites on the internet before your trip - just type ""Suffolk County wineries"" (or whatever) in a search, and start studying! If a winery you want to visit is in the book, definitely read what they have to say. Just be aware that other wineries that are good (Gary Farrell) or great (the tiny but superb Nalle Winery) are not included in the book, and are really worth seeing. Use the guide to augment your research, but don't rely solely on this - or any other one - guide to give you complete info on a trip to the wine country."
3,Stairway Gate?,".....If you don't mind drilling into the wall AND banister!!!!!!My husband did not want to ruin the banister so he zip tied a 2 x 4 to it and attached it to that. The gate works, it is a pain in the butt to open and more of a pain to close, but what do you really expect for the price?"
2,Light weight plastic and not tall enough,"I bought this for my baby brother, Jay. He is my Mom's 1 year old foster child who she is in the process of adopting. Here is what my Mom said about the gate:""The gate seemed OK but was very light weight plastic and we didn't think it was sturdy enough to keep a strong baby like Jay from breaking it out of the wall and then tumbling with it down the steps. Most importantly, the gate was not very tall, only about 24"" I think, The railing around the top of the steps is more like 32"". We felt that baby would be hanging over the top of the gate and fall down the steps (Jay is already 33 inches tall).""They ended up buying a different gate, so it was a waste of money for me. If I lived in the same state, I would just bring it home to use in my house for my baby since we don't have any stairs."
2,"Nice gate, but not as advertised.","I purchased this gate to contain my small dog.When it arrived, it was not the same gate pictured in the previews despite that the item number is the same. Please be aware that instead of coming with nice rounded bits that fit down into a piece fastened to the door, it only includes plastic sockets that hold the round cushions that nearly all gates of this type have. As such, I've chosen to just use the gate without mounting anything to the wall because the included mounting brackets simply don't seem to be sturdy at all. Furthermore the 'swinging' brackets do not work at all when applied the way the directions suggest, however with some difficulty we did get them to work but they were not sturdy and the gate slipped off of them easily.If you need this to protect a child, I would definitely recommend getting something better. If you just need a basic gate, though, it works well enough."
1,You get what you pay for!,I ordered this gate because it was so cheap. I priced stairway gates and they were all very expensive. I was so happy to have found one for a third of the cost. It definitely is cheap! It is made of a flimsy plastic. It doesn't stay open...it automatically slams shut. The door expands in width...to fit wide and narrow doorways. Well...it changes width on its own...wish there was a way to lock its width in place. It is not difficult for me to lock but my 9 year old can't do it.
3,Great for Price,"This gate is great for its price. We did end up attaching it to a couple 2x4's so that we didn't have to reck the wood on the stairs. The gate does what we need it too, however just know that you will need to drill holes in wall/stairs!"
2,North States Stairway Gate,Very awkward to use. Need two hands & a lot of tugging & pulling to position the gate into its mounts.
1,A Slogan without Substance,"A great academic study, but business people won't find this book very useful because its main theme (Forget, Borrow, Learn) is too vague to apply. The book doesn't tell you what to forget, what to borrow or what to learn. Nor does it provide any guidance on how to figure out what to forget, borrow or learn. So, as a senior executive, I haven't got any idea about what to do with my firm."
1,Misleading item,This company advertises an arm band with silicone or leather case which is not the case. It DOES NOT come with a case. Don't be fooled like I was.
5,armband,Great for what it is. Way too large for the child. Going to cut it off and have it shortened. Hope they don't charge me a fortune to do that.
1,Not worth a penny,I wasn't expecting a high end item but this didn't have anywhere for my ipod to attach. This is useless to me.
2,Small is too small.,"I gave the review 4 stars for a great product. However, I subtracted a star because the small is too small for our 5 months old, weights 13 lbs and 23 inches long (small for his age). He can't stretch his legs out and looks very uncomfortable. Halo does not make a swaddle blanket larger than small (took off another star for that). I'm lucky that we were able to last as long as we did. My friend's kids sized out at 3 months. Yikes!"
1,Not for my truck,"I purchased in December, installed 1/1/11 and returning this month to one of the best vendors ever on Amazon.... O'Donnell's Auto Parts. Kevin helped me trouble shoot the issues at hand and my 1997 Toyota 4Runner. Conclusion: The 4Runner's windshield is too flat and the silblades tension too tight to sweep water/debris without leaving a gap in the center of the blade.Just thought anyone with an older vehicle might want to know."
2,"Good price, but not a good wiper","I got this blade on the Amazon deal of the day when they were buy one get one free - so the price was good. However, they squeak whenever the windshield is not completely soaked. I haven't used them enough (on about 3 different occasions at this point) to know if this is a problem only because they are new, but if not, they will be coming back off of my car shortly."
1,Cheap or Missing Connectors,I purchased two of these for my wife's car. The first one did not have all the connecting adapters with it and was missing the one we needed. The second one had the connector but it was cheap plastic and broke when I tried to use it. So I now have two expensive wind shield wipers with no way to attach them to my car. A total waster.
3,good product.. doesn't fit.,It said it fits the 2011 Hyundai tuscon.. but clearly doesn't have the proper hook on attachment.I removed the blad and slid it into the loops of my old conecting blade.. works well but improperly labeled to fit my vehicle. I'm sure it works for the 2010.
5,"18"" Silblade Wiper works great","We needed new wipers on both of our cars. I had heard good things about silicone wipers and decided to try them on both of our cars. They work beautifully, leaving a clean surface everytime they wipe. I cannot say anything about their durability - but everything I have read about silicone wipers tells me to expect them to last a long time. Wonderful product at a wonderful price."
1,"Barely lasted a year, warranty service is terrible","After about 8 months on my car, these wipers started to streak and chatter. Contacted Silblade for warranty replacements, and they told me they would be shipping me free replacements under warranty within a week. Three weeks later they still have not sent me the replacements and they are not answering my emails. The wipers worked great while they lasted, but you'll be lucky if they last a year. The 5 year warranty seems like pure marketing hype to get you to spend a little more on wipers. I could have gotten 8 months out of a pair of cheap Anco wipers for a lot less money. I won't be buying these again.UPDATE: I finally a received replacement blades, but only one of the replacements was the right size, and they were both a different ""uni"" style, made with a plastic frame that does not seem as durable as the metal ones that I originally bought. This really is the last straw, ad I will not be a repeat customer!"
3,Squeaky blades,"These wiper blades take the rain off when there is a good flow of rain, but whenever there is only mist they squeak on every wipe and I have to turn them off until more water builds up on the windshield even when I have the setting at the lowest intermittent speed."
5,Best windshield wiper ever,"I just drove from Illinois to California hitting alot of rain and mist. I have to say that these are the best windshield wipers I have ever had on any of my cars. Now, wait for my review that will be in 5 years since that is what they say how long they last. Buying more to replace all the family cars wipers."
1,Ludicrous,"This book isn't even good as fantasy. There's not one believable thing about it, certainly not the plot, the action or the characters. I can't believe anyone could give this more than one star. It was so stupid, I skimmed through the last half and didn't miss a thing! Bad writing. Bad book."
2,Not for feminists!,"On the whole, I thought this book provided a good overview of topics to discuss prior to marriage -- particularly for couples who plan to have children. Even for those couple who don't plan to have children, this book offers a comprehensive list of topics to at least discuss prior to making a life-long commitment.However, as a feminist I was dismayed by some of the politics and opinions that the author opined. For example, the author says that women should submit to their husbands sexually ""as often as possible"" so as to avoid adultery on the husband's part. While the author does go to some length to discuss the absolute prohibition of domestic violence, I felt his opinion that women should submit sexually to their husband's needs was somewhat contradictory. In addition, his comments about unplanned pregnancies (""unborn child"") left something to be desired. However, if you don't find these issues important or are willing to overlook them, you might find this book useful."
5,"This book is pretty unique, I've never read one like it.","I found this book to be informative and full of good creative ideas that will help me when I get married.The range of subjects covered was very broad and covered a lot of things that will be essential for my fiance and I to discuss before we get married.I especially liked that there was a sample marriage contract, since I haven't seen anything like that elsewhere.Overall I would give this book a very high rating because it might help a lot of people work out problems ahead of time. It also might help some people change their minds about getting married before they go too far!"
1,Terrible conversion of classic video games,"I was disappointed with Destination Software's ""Gauntlet/Rampart"" cartridge but my hopes were up with the ""Millipede/Lunar Lander/Super Breakout"" cartridge which was decent. So I bought this cartridge and I was very, very disappointed.Asteroids has terrible graphics and animation--it does not resemble the arcade version, and in this version it is done very poorly. Yar's Revenge is somewhat better, but it was done half-heartedly--I have the Atari 2600 version at home and I can tell the differences.As for Pong, I suppose it resembles closest to the original compared to the other two, but then it was not that difficult to do so. I swear that the collision detection is not precise as I saw the ball pass through the paddle a few times.Avoid this title at all costs."
1,totally unusable,"It is absolutely impossible to get this item to properly adhere to the screen without tons of bubbles getting trapped between the plastic and the screen. And you could never get the screen clean enough to be able to remove all the bubbles. I cannot stress this enough--it must be immaculate!! Maybe if you work for Intel and you opened your computer for the first time in a ""clean room"" at the microchip plant, you might have a chance. Otherwise, forget it!"
2,"It does NOT fit the Macbook Pro 15.4"" unibody.","When I first bought it, I thought it would protect the entire screen. Then when I got it and looked at it, I realized that it would only cover part of the screen, and not the black border.So I got home and held it up (while still in the package)to the screen, and it doesn't fit at all! It's too wide, and not even tall enough to fit the screen. It's like a long rectangle.I don't understand why it's advertised to fit the 15"" Macbook Pro when it doesn't. And mine did not come with a free cleansing cloth either.I didn't find many other screen protectors, so I'm considering returning it or just dealing with it and keeping it..."
1,Wasnt even the right size..,"I dont even think it could even fit a 13 inch Model MackBook Pro, unless there is some trick to sticking a screen protector unto a Screen, this Product was wayyyy too wide and not even enough Height to cover all the Glass area on a new MacBook Pro.DID NOT FIT!!! Doesnt cover the whole Glass Area as thought!"
4,Great book for MM SAP consultant,"As someone in the MM/SD/APO functional space with about 2-3 implementations, I really enjoyed this book, as it is focused on MM - thats the guys background, and it gave some good general tips - ""leave it SAP standard as much as possible and here's why"", and it made me fell like I had done another few implementations after reading. Pretty bad spelling mistakes - if the publishers do another print, let me know and I will proof it for them! But for what I was looking for it was great."
4,For Those Thinking About Or Doing An SAP Implementation,Great book for those about to or thinking about doing an SAP implementation. The end is very technical but explains what to look out for when doing an SAP implementation or have done one.
4,more applicable for the modern thinker,"The art of strategy is a less militaristic translation than others I have read. I have used it in a strategy class and found the students were comfortable with the concepts and the way Wing applies them to modern confrontation in all its potential. I find this translation is a real problem solver by providing the reader with a more total look at the use of strategy and the need to think through the roadblocks that confront us. I have purchased several dozen copies of this book as gifts for people who for one reason or another have a need to apply taoist thinking to problem solving. In most cases the Art of Strategy has proved of benefit. While other translations of the Art of War may be clearer in the presentation of Sun Tzu's use of the tao, (such as Cleary's ""Art of War""), this version seems to connect with today's mind."
2,questionable information,"There are several statements in this program that are questionable, if not wrong. A couple of examples include the statement that the Irish were 'the hardest working people in America.' And the Irish migration was the greatest migration of all time. The forced migration of Africans to the Americas dwarfs the number of Irish. In addition the forced labor, at their masters' whips, would challenge who were the hardest working people in America.The Irish had an amazing influence on America, the incorrect facts in this program are not needed to prove that fact."
3,Not as good as the PBS series,"This video, while informative, lacked the ""feeling"" of the series on PBS. Specifically, it lacked the anecdotal information. For example, the PBS series revealed that the Irishman's value was more as ballast than as a passenger on the trip to America since the trade surplus from cotton, tobacco, etc. meant nearly empty ships returning to America from England. That type of insight into everyday life was lacking, in my opinion, in this video."
3,Not much information,"This two volume set; each video fifty minutes long, is like a cliff note version of the Irish coming to America. Talks about English rule over Ireland and the reason they first came to the colonies and the strugles to find themselves in the United States. I just though it could of been more informative and the a little bit longer."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"Once an adult movie is decades old, does that make it no longer adult? If you can get ""Debbie Does"" and ""Devil in Miss Jones,"" then why not go for this?I saw this for Sonny Landham and I'm saddened that his role was so small. Still, if you want to see more of his corporeality than you saw in ""Predator,"" then this is a good start. Sonny Landham, is a Native American actor playing a Senator, and this is years before Senator Nighthorse Campbell, a real man, became a Native American Senator.If you like 1970s flicks with their gaudy makeup and excess, you may want to peep this. For all I know, this work could have influence the writers of Mark Wahlberg's ""Boogie Nights."""
1,WTF?,"My brother bought me this as a birthday gift and let me tell you: what a bunch of bull! The First disc you're getting what you expect, as for the second...in a nutshell, Korean Karaoke. More amusing, track 7, ""Even Better Than The Real Thing"" is labeled as a Dead Or Alive song which we all know is in fact U2. Like it matters anyway, neither artist performed these rip-offs. And just for the record, Tiffany was not New Wave, so what is it doing on a New Wave compilation? Ooh, and before I forget, the rap thrown into the middle of track 4, ""Walking In L.A."" is completely uncalled for. I am thoroughly disgusted and appalled. Please don't support the fools at Cleopatra Records. The artists should be offended by this company's ignorance and sue for misrepresenting their music. You know, if you're going to sell someone a karaoke CD label it that way."
5,"Sad story, but a real one","The story of the author's grandmother is the same as the story my grandmother told me. Yes, her entire family was killed by the Turks. As a small child, I attended the Armenain school where all of us would compare stories as to how our grandparents survived the death marches. It is a very nice story that tells about history, a history that is kept hidden for many political reasons. Until the world fully ackhowledges what happened to the Armenians, and punishes the Turks, many more genocides and attorcities will take place. After all, if the Turks can get away with the torture, killing, rapes, and genocide (while countries such as the United States let them get away with it), then other similar regimes will committ similar attorcities.I storngly recommend this book."
4,"Should be read by everyone, Turks too!","This book reminded me of Catch-22 in many ways: it started in a comedic vein, with amusing anecdotes of family life (I'm not Armenian, but I could relate), which made the horror-show that followed all the more ghastly. Also, as a teacher who taught in Turkey for three years, I remember many times hearing the same bits of propaganda from my students that Balakian accuses the Turkish government of. This book should be translated into Turkish so students there could learn what many people in the west already know, as well as learn more about a people, via a personal history, that once formed an integral part of their own society."
1,Schrage writes like he never worked in a company before.,"I started out this book being frustrated by the assumptions Schrage makes. For example, at the beginning of the book he talks about collaboration and seems to be making the assumption that people who work in teams DO NOT collaborate.Maybe my experience working in a software company is different from what people experience in other industries, but it seemed to me as if Schrage had a bizarre view of how people interact within a corporation.Schrage's central message seems to be that tools help people collaborate--not exactly an insight. Finally, he discusses collaborative processes like brainstorming sessions and quality circles. These are not new things.Overall, I felt the book had very little to offer."
1,Funnier Than a Three Stooges Video!,"As President of Tekton Apologetics Ministries I've had a lot of practice taking Earl to task, and he prefers to respond with harrumphs and grunts and arguments that dig him even deeper in his hole. All of the arguments in this book are derived from his earlier book, The Jesus Puzzle, so if you already have that you won't miss anything. Doherty's attempt to refute Strobel is no more than a case of Doherty trying to milk the cash cow that Strobel's works have become.Doherty fancies himself an expert, but has bitten off way more than he can chew. He is behind the eight-ball of scholarly consensus on every point -- and I speak here of secular as well as religious scholarship.Me? I read it for amusement."
1,The overall picture . . .,"Wow, after reading the editorial review and the many different reviews of this book, I am deeply saddened by what is going on here. It is so easy for scholars to pick apart the works of others. It would not matter if Lee Strobel interviewed God in person, someone like Earl Doherty would come along and convince many that it was all a lie. The overall picture is this: if you don't want to accept the gift of salvation offered by God through Jesus, then you will find any excuse available to deny it. However, don't use Doherty or anyone else's theories to keep you away from Jesus. If you TRULY seek to know God, He will reveal Himself to you - that's His promise to all of us."
1,Not a proper cross-examination,"I picked up Case for Christ, because it was recommended to me by a friend, and being very skeptical about friend's recommendations, it took me a while to get to that book. But when I did I was blown away. It wasn't just any author trying to persuade you that Jesus Christ really is who he said he is, rather Strobel establishes his case premise by premise, and builds upon a strong foundation. Most importantly, he decides to talk to knowledgeable people when confronted by topics he doesn't know anything about.Doherty, on the other hand, isntead of interviewing those scholars that Strobel did, takes quotes from the book, and twists them around to fit his argument. In order to do a proper cross-examination, you need to have the witness, not just the witness' statement. Doherty fails to do that, and he failed to win my respect, rather, he lost what little of it I had for him because of his lack of scholarly debate."
4,Outstanding,"For its time, this is an outstanding game. Basic RTS which gave birth to one of the largest game's. This is where WOW began. Basic storyline allows you to take part in either the orc or the human campaign. This game when compared to games now is very limited in all respects. For its time it is amazing and a must have for any true warcraft fan. The basic concept leaves on wanting more for sure.complexity 3/5graphics 1/5bots 1/5gameplay 3/5story 2/5overall 3.75/5age: 10+"
4,This DVD is really nice with my upconverting DVD player & LCD TV,"Great DVD ! I am not sure about how come certain people didnt like this DVD, but for me I have a upconverting DVD player called the XDE by Toshiba, which plays regular DVDs very close to High def, so that is a big reason why this aquarium DVD plays so clear like it actually there. And i have a 37 inch LCD TV. I think if the people who reviewed this DVD haD the equipment I have they would have thought differently. Nice product."
2,Tedious,"As a former employee of Cisco Systems, I was interested in finding out what goes on at the executive level, and how well Cisco is really doing versus its competition. However, that is not what this book delivers. Instead, it is a tedious repetition of ""gee whiz"" numbers and hyperbole about the internet. It sounds like it was written by John Chambers, not about him. It does not delve past Chambers's carefully crafted public persona to reveal anything noteworthy about the real person. It does not go into any detail about the workings of Cisco's highly regarded executive team. One third of the book is not even about Cisco, and there does not seem to be any information in the book that is not part of the public record. The book reads like a public relations handout. The only ""unauthorized"" thing in this book is probably the wording of the title."
1,Needs Improvement,"As an avid reader of poetry, I have to relate that this book lacks motivation. The poems seem ""thrown together"" and many lack direction. Too many poems start an idea, only to have the thought pattern dropped in the middle. The love poems are nice, but I never feel any energy. When a writer delivers in their poetry the emotion he/she felt when writing it, the art is preserved. Here, I never felt the preservation of art. It feels like the writer just wrote to be writing, and never felt what he was writing. The whole time reading it, my mind continuously wandered to the other books I could pick up. I can't recommend this book because it never moved me."
5,More light!,"With prose that is always lucid, and often lyrical, Jeffrey Smith describes his attempt to integrate his depression into his life as a whole. To this reader, some of his survival strategies seem wrong-headed: he time and again seeks solace in the wilderness (rarely finding it), his choice of pet is all wrong (trade in the skittish cat for a german shepherd puppy), and his chosen work (with the halt and the lame) couldn't be more depressing.That said, his natural history of melancholia will provide a tonic for many a reader. He's dug up some fascinating insights and speculations about those of us who live under the sign of Saturn, much of which is passed over in silence by our current vocabulary for discussing depression.Finally, it's unfortunate that the author is so dismissive of psychoanalysis. Not the therapy, but Freud's worldview, his admirable stoicism, has served some of us very well (see FREUD: THE MIND OF THE MORALIST, by Philip Rieff)."
1,Not what it appears to be!,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the product and the heart is very small, the picture does not depict what you're actually getting."
1,.........................SO DISSAPOINTED,THIS ABLUM SUX!! DRE DOESN'T EVEN RAP IN IT. THE SONGS SUX. THE BEAT SUX. THE ARTISTS SUX.
3,"Liked it, but it took a long time to get going","Rainbows End is a techno-satire set in a not-too-distant future where information technology has advanced to the point that it dominates all other aspects of life. People actually ""wear"" their online computers and perform research/analysis miracles by the minute. The problem is that with the vastly improved efficiency of life, bad things as well as good can happen very fast.The plot involves one of those bad things, mind control, but the plot seems to take a back seat to the overall technological theme of the book so much so that the first 60% of the book is basically setup. That gets tedious. It's also fascinating and disturbing, but I admit that I had a hard time getting through the first 220 pages of Rainbows End. Once the plot develops, the book becomes far more readable with highlights involving covert and military operations as well as the typical Vernor Vinge computer AI.Only recommended for those who have tremendous amounts of patience."
4,A sad story about old age,"Vinge fans looking for a mind-blowing space epic like A Fire Upon the Deep will be disappointed; this book is a different animal, more similar in tone and feeling to the haunting slowness of Marooned in Realtime (though ultimately a bit more lighthearted and optimistic). Rainbows End is a story about old age, for the protagonists, but also for the human race. The technological ideas (reality augmentation, wearable computers) are not as mind-blowingly original as some of the stuff in Vinge's earlier works, but the depiction of a culture that has fully adjusted to the internet is, as far as I know, unrivaled in modern literature. As for the plot, it's more of a portrait of several people's lives, with a loose story framework draped on top in Vinge's trademark minimalistic style.Bottom line: if you're looking for something thoughtful, this is a good read. From Vinge, we should expect no less."
4,"""Maybe there was some word for these ... children. Paraliterate?""",Not as ... comprehensive as Fire Upon the Deep or Deepness in the Sky - but - it is pure Vernor Vinge - an amazing layering of the life of an awakening old man and poet into a world where writing and reading are obsolete - everyone is immersed in technology - and while he struggles to catch up and while books are being shredded - he is also trying to share his skills with a young student who is actually interested in this dying art. Of course there is tons of conspiracy and way more going on than this - but I loved this part of the story which is nearly lost under the levels of noise and actions and technology.
2,Great concepts but slow pace makes for difficult read,"Rainbows End is the first Vernor Vinge novel I've read and while I was slightly disappointed with it overall there was enough promising speculation to warrant checking out more of his work. The evolution of the internet described throughout Rainbows End seems a very real possibility in the next decade, but as a plot device there was not enough going on to keep the pages turning over the way I'd expected. I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't quite finish the novel tossing it after the end-of-year performances. I'm not sure if Robert Gu even found out about his wife, but obviously I don't care enough to read on and that I suppose is the problem I have with Rainbows End. 2/5"
2,what was that ?,there were too many intricacies in this. I just want a book that I can sit down and enjoy. Old Mans War is an example of such a book. I couldn't get through this book
2,I've never seen a book crumble the way this one did,"This book started off interesting. Vinge's vision of the near future is fascinating and seems reasonable. Then the plot nose dives into a ridiculous comic book style, save the world storyline. Even that wouldn't have been so bad if Vinge was able to bring the reader along but instead he destroys any chance we have of enjoying this novel by making it far too convoluted. It becomes more and more obvious as the pages move on that this book is going to require a little more attention than it's worth. Vinge leaves us uninspired, uninterested, and thinking about our laundry instead of the plot."
4,I love this book,"I'm a long time Verner Vinge fan and this book is different from his usual. It is a very probable future regarding where technology is taking us. Including the lack of privacy and ""Rabbits"" searching the web and knowing more about us than we know about our selves. It doesn't bother me that we don't know who Rabbit is, I think that is the point. Anonymous people will be poking their noses in everyones business and there will be little that we can do to stop it. There will also be many good things in this future.Read the book,Liz"
5,The future of augmented reality,Excellent and realistic depiction of what real-life products like my startup's Epiphany Eyewear will make possible in the near future.
2,Worst Burnout in History!!!!!!!!!! /:(,"When i heard that there would be a fifth installment to the Burnout series, i thought awesome! A new Burnout game! But it turned out to be a rip-off! No crash mode! No Traffic checking! No good music! And although the return of doing burnouts is cool, you can't advance your boost bar like 3x unlike burnout 3 or burnout 4 revenge. Don't waste your money on this burnout! It sucks!"
2,"Huge disappointment, not worth $40","As other reviewers here have noted, this is more akin to ""Burnout Lite"" than a real Burnout game. I don't know what EA was thinking to release a Burnout game without the Crash Mode, but that's what they did, and it's not worth the $40 price. If you're skeptical, rent it first...I think you'll conclude that this is the weakest of the sequels. Note also that the game does NOT support old analog wheels or PS1 controllers...another really bad decision by EA. Supposedly, they're making the ""real"" Burnout 5 for the PS3. But given this sorry ripoff, it won't be a reason for me to spend my money on a new console."
5,ps2 game,"I bought this for my son used he loves the game and it was in great condition at 1/2 the price as new,most people play the game for a bit then sell them so why buy new when you can get them in the same shape at amazon"
3,Good but not Amazing,when I picked up this book I didn't know what to expect. I have read everything by Dekker and if you have too then you understand why I didn't know what to expect. This book was good but not amazing. If you're looking for a book that will inspire and encourage your walk of faith then this is a great book. If you are looking for a fiction piece that is based in Christian beliefs then this is good. In my opinion the story line is a bit simple and very predictable. But the character growth is entertaining. It's not Dekkers best literary piece but probably one of his best spiritual ones.
5,Can't Get Enough of This Dekker Guy,"I'm going to keep it short and sweet. I went on a little bit about When Heaven Weeps, but I couldn't help it--it just really got to me. So did Blessed Child, but in a different way. Blessed Child is unique. All of Ted Dekker's novels give us a wonderful picture of the love of God in action, but Blessed Child has this tranquility in the face of extreme danger that is really compelling. I felt like a totally refreshing shower had washed over me after reading this book--an absolutely unique experience, something I've never encountered in any other book I've read. The only thing that comes close is Leif Enger's Peace Like a River, though the two books are very different. I truly felt like a blessed child of God after reading this book. And so will you, I predict."
1,"A real page turner, but for the wrong reasons.","I read this book cover to cover on an airplane. I was INFATUATED with it, because I could not belive how horrible it was! I kept thinking that the next page would jump to life unlike the rest of the book which is nothing more than empty characters and plot that was obviously written after many viewings of the movie CHINATOWN. I must admit, I found the ending stunning, stunningly predictable and depressing. It does have nice title and the history noir is well researched, but that simply isn't enough for me. It truely is one of the worst books I've ever. read."
3,Neither terribly interesting nor particularly memorable,"This book is so similar to so many others that there isn't much to recommend it. If you want to read about werewolves, try Bitten by Kelly Armstrong (less romantic) or the ""Moon"" books by Lori Handeland (more romantic). The heroine, Rosalind, is gorgeous and foolishly independent to the point of near stupidity. The hero, Armond, is another stubborn, Greek statue come to life with a family curse and two brothers (can we say trilogy?). There is the requisite wise old crone, nasty family member, spunky friend, horrid suitor, and of course, three painfully obvious mysteries to solve (you should have them all figured out by Chapter Six). Around page 300, the story, or dare I call it a plot, completely collapses. I know that what I have written here is harsher than the rating, but I know that there is an audience for this type of book. I'm just not a part of that audience."
4,Interesting topic,"Just a warning not to be deceived about this content of this book. It is not so much about the psychology in feeling that a man's fertile time could be running out, but in discussing that male fertility can also be affected by the aging process.The book covers the topics of male infertility and sexual performance as well as issues, causes, treatments and psychology of these issues.All in all, a pretty comprehensive analysis of the male reproductive system."
5,Great for Beginner Fiddler/Violinists,"This book is very user-friendly and offers great tips on how to play the violin. I also love the author's style. His love for the fiddle comes through in this book. There are words to accompany the music and the free CD is great to practice with. If you don't love fiddle tunes now, you will love them after you learn to play a couple of these tunes. The illustrations are a nice touch too!"
1,save the money,"I bought this r/c car for my nephew's birthday, he was five at the time. He was very excited and used it right away. After five minutes he became frustrated because the steering mechanism is awkward. The age category should be for older kids. The steering mechanism isn't very user friendly, because even an adult that was trying to help my nephew hat trouble with getting the car to go into the right direction.Furthermore, the toy is not very sturdy. After about a week of frustration, the car pretty much broke apart in several different places. I can't tell whether it was because it was not sturdy to begin with, or if the breaking was associated with repeated run-ins with walls because of the steering difficulties.I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Chritsmas present,I purchased this item to give away as a chritsmas present. I have not been able to watch the movie yet. Shipping was very fast. Thanks
3,More intelligent than Jurassic Park,"Leapin' lizards! This is an adventure at every turn of the page. One drawback is the complicated, hard-to-believe time travel aspect. I've personally never done it, so it kinda wrecks the credibility for me. Jurassic Park is better for credibility, but lacks the intelligent dinosaurs, which are a cool idea to consider. Better then either in my opinion, is Thomas Hopp's Dinosaur Wars, where no time travel is involved, and the intelligent (and very credible) dinosaurs are based on the latest science. They are as much birds as reptiles, like velociraptors with feathers. If you like the science fictiony time travel thing, stick to Bradbury's Dinosaur World. If you want a believable story based on the very latest science get Hopp's Dinosaur Wars."
3,to replace old onkyo,got this to replace my old subwoofer that burned out. not very happy with the quality. it is not that good if you do not turn the volume up. but then if you do there is all sort of crakling and vibration noise from the unit.not one of my best choices.
2,"Great Bass, Anoying Standby Function.","This sub sounds great for the price, however the auto standby function kills it. I have never seen a subwoofer with this kind of problem before. There is no way to override it and it takes a fair amount of bass for it to kick back on. On top of this, when it kicks back on, it takes over two seconds before the relay trips and sound actually comes out. This is a major problem, for example, when you're watching a relatively quiet movie and there is a sudden explosion. By the time the sub kicks on the explosion sound is over with. I would not recommend this sub to anyone. Spend a little extra and get something better."
3,Too Small for my System,"I have to return this sub and replace it with JBL ES250PBK, it is just too small for my system, if I crank it up to full volume then it rattles and give me a distorted sound, it was my mistake that I went the cheap side, but it will be a good one for small set ups and maybe with some Low freq. help from your front speakers."
4,Best powered subwoofer I've owened,"This thing just puts out such a natural low-end sound. I never looked too deeply into the speaker and amp specs of this, but the parts sound top notch.Cons: only reason for only 4 stars is the auto-shutdown which seems useful, but basically makes the unit make strange noises at random times (when it shuts off, then when it kicks back in). Seems to be they would have been better not implementing this feature. How much power are you really going to save??"
5,bass!,This thing will shake the windows out of your living room great purchase! you do not need a bigger sub unless you have a concert hall in your house!
4,Great subwoofer,Great sound and tight deep base. Only problem speaker is very sensitive to other electrical lines running near its lines and doesn't got to standby very fast . It hums for about 15 minutes.
5,Outstanding,I'll keep this short. Starting as a total novice in Dreamweaver this book has taught me pretty much everything I need to know. When ever I get stuck now I can get the answers that I need. Certainly blows the online help from Adobe out of the water. This is a must have book.
5,This is THE Dreamweaver book,"I went through every book review, then checked out all the books at the local Book Superstore and ended up getting this, although I wondered why it only had 4.5 stars.It is the perfect book for DW8 and fully deserves 5 full stars! I had been using DW4 for five years and it is nice that this book is both understandable and not over simplified."
2,low printing quality,"I bought the book after I read the positive reviews in Amazon. But I felt kind of shocking when I received the book. If I had bought it in China, I would have thought that it were a pirated copy. The printing quality is bad. Some of the words at the back of the book is half way cutoff. No color figures for any art examples and the black-and-white photos are so blur that they can hardly be recognized what was illustrated. I would accept it if it is a handout from an Art class, but not a book for over twenty dollars. As for the contents, I haven't read through it yet. I hope it is not as bad as it is ""seen"". It is unprofessionally printed/made."
3,da vinci wood grain automatic playing card shuffler,"Bought this for a gift for my mother. when she opened it a part was broken when received and had to be glued, then it worked fine."
2,Card Shuffler problems,"When the card shuffler arrived the wood casing was not glued to the plastic mechanism - there was plenty of glue of some type, but it was not holding. Lifting by the wood casing caused the mechanism to drop.The shuffler frequently sent 4-6 cards into the pit at once. The did not drop properly, and caused a jam on almost every shuffle.Pressing the button intermittently helped a lot, but not enough.I have returned the shuffler to Amazon."
1,Playing card shuffler,"I received 2 of these card shufflers, one fell apart after using for about 1 hour, had to re glue the whole thing back together. The other one has worked for about 4-5 hours and now shuffles when it wants to. I would not advise anybody to purchase these cheepley made products."
1,Shuffle off to Buffalo -- or rather back to Amazon,"This POS wouldn't shuffle 4 out of 5 different decks we tried -- so it promptly went back to Amazon. As far as I can tell, there aren't any decent shufflers out there. Can anyone point me to one?"
4,card shuffler,The card shuffler arrived in excelent condition. it works fine. It arrived in less than a week. Excelent product & excellent service.
3,Handy shuffler,"Handy shuffler for people with dry hands. The glue holding the sides on let go after 2 days, so I re-glued it useing construction adhesive."
5,Nice works great!,"Works great for the price. We have had this for a couple years now. It won't shuffle the last few cards if you overload it, which is normal. The little pull out tray fell out easily and we eventually lost it, but we just tip the cards out now."
3,Love the 70's stuff but too silly to watch in one sitting.,good for a few laughs. I appreciate the way the actors really nail the 70's characters. Cool retro props to remind you of the good old days.
5,Excellent explanation book of this technique,"""Be not deceived; God is not mocked:for whatsoever a man soweth, thatshall he also reap. For he that so-weth to his flesh shall of the fleshreap corruption: but he that sowethto the spirit shall of the spiritreap life everlasting."" Gal. 6:7,8A treatise on the Interpretation ofthe Old and New Testements by MiltTerry. A book you will want in yourlibrary!"
2,This is funny?,"I found this book to illustrate every stereotype of the gay man that I'm not. It's tired. This book could have been written any Friday night by the drag queens that perform at GiGi's in Detroit. Sometimes I found this book to actually be painful, like I was reading about my own foolish mistakes that I made when I came out in 1984...like trusting a gay man to be a real pal. Dull, dull, dull."
2,Feh.,"About as stereotypical as you can get without being Liberace. And not half so funny or insightful as the authors would have you believe. To quote one of my favorite Queens, ""We are not amused""."
3,Coast 7736D flashlight,"Really works for the application I needed. While the white light opens areas where I need to look, the red light is very useful for the night applications."
2,Good for beginning ER nurses,"This book had good content, but for someone studying for the CEN exam, it is way too basic. This is an easy to use book and I liked the format, with the answers on the back of the page of questions.The computer program that came with the book was fun to use and reduced my anxiety about taking the CEN on a computer, but again the questions were too easy."
4,Great for Right Handed Kids But Not for Left Handed,"I'm writing these reviews to spare other parents my frustration of trying different grips that are said to be for both right and left hand, and really they are not. So far the ones I've tried that are asymmetrical are perfectly designed to fit into the right hand and do not work for the left hand at all.It would be nice if they made these for just the left hand."
3,A dulled razor edged Gillette,"Steve Gillette was popular in the LA folk movement of the early/mid '60's. He, like many others in the topical song writing era had a following, but not much sales. Steve had the advantage of being a terrific 12 string guitar player and a pleasant voice. He had the disadvantage of being a bit humorless, at least on record. He wrote a minor pop hit, ""Back on the Street Again"", that was recorded by Sunshine Co., a LA vocal group akin to Mamas and Papas. I hope he kept the credit and gets some royalties, because this sort of earnest songwriting is of a past walk that few wander through. This CD has his complete first album and would sit nicely next to Phil Ochs, except that Phil might smirk a bit..."
4,"Third in the ""Midnight"" series","On the 1-10 scale, I'd put this book at about a 9.9, or 4 3/4 stars.This book was had a good mystery to it, and all the characters in all 3 of the books were present. I enjoyed it very much.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars or a 10 is that though the hero is great, he is not my ideal hero. I prefer Stephen in the previous book."
2,Just okay,"I purchased this product hoping to ""greenly"" ease the work of having to prevent and remove the snow on the steps and porch at my Colorado home. The sprayer is not worth buying. Get one from your local hardware store. The product itself is a temporary ( very temporary) for keeping the snow off. Plus it did not melt a thin layer of ice. For me , it was not worth the money and time it takes to apply. Bought a new shovel instead."
2,"works well, I mean not so well...","This works best if sprayed on bare concrete. It did not melt the ice but prevented any snow/ ice from sticking to the driveway.It was much easier to clean away ice and snow. Yes, all that is true. But after further use(2.5gallons worth), we would not recommend this. After an ice storm it did not help, we used salt. So we will now use a shovel, broom, and salt.. No more wasting time spraying. And ... if you want to try it just buy the gallon bottle, and use your own sprayer..."
2,Not like the picture,"Instead of the picture of a sprayer and a gallon of solution, it came with just the sprayer with the solution within. This might be okay but the device itself looks nothing like the picture at all. Not only that but there was absolutely no directions.The sprayer looks easy enough to use, a pump handle on top and a hose that is attached to the bottom of the plastic container, but again it looks nothing like the picture. I thought about sending it back but frankly I don't want to go through the hassle. What I am going to do is save it and try it out when the weather gets icy and see if it works.I will leave additional feedback when I actually use it, maybe I can find some directions online. I will say it only took a few days to reach us but it is not even that clean, looks like it has been sitting around for a long while. At the moment there is no way I would purchase this again but then I might change my mind if it actually works."
3,like detective series,"Like the series, but I think its a little slow going. More action would be good. Perhaps because its a bit dated now."
4,HD powerline adapters work ok,"I've been using these adapters now for about 4 months. The file server is in the basement and the media center is on the ground floor on the other side of the building. It's a rental and a brownstone, so there's no getting 'creative' with laying down cat6. My router is only 100mbit, so i've never expected to get the advertised amount. I just needed enough to stream video/audio. i've not tried HD content because the media device is not up to that task, but I've rarely had problems stemming from the adapters. About 3 times I've had to 'restart' the two adapters in 4 months, but it's possible those were more to do with corrupt content. Either way, unless you have substandard or incorrectly-installed wiring in your house, I think these have been useful so long as you don't expect to run multiple video streams and online gaming instances at the same time."
4,Great solution to my wifi reliability.,"Wifi can be a mixed bag -- sometimes it very flaky, sometimes it's less flaky. With the additional use of the Xbox360s streaming capabilities, I decided the put my videos on the network to watch.Initially, the wifi seemed ok to start streaming, but we quickly saw how its reliability wore off with paused video and broken streaming (we were trying to stream a mix of HDTV and DVDs). As much as I wanted to put cat5e in the room with the 360, there was no way to get it wired without some serious work being done.Enter ... PowerlineHD! Plug and play -- it really was that simple (as long as you DO NOT go through a powerstrip).I'm getting around 50Mb/sec with my unit; much lower than the advertised max of 200Mb/sec, but it never blinks and it's faster than my wifi network."
2,Forewarned and Still Disappointed,"Going in I knew this device would have issues, I needed to run network to my second floor and was not ready for wireless nor ripping old dry wall apart to drop new Ethernet.I anticipated getting at least 10Mbps from a device that advertizes 200MBps. I used the internal tool to check bandwidth and found a location on my second floor that provided approx 40Mbps. Ideal!However in use I experienced patchy performance, even though the internal diagnostic tool consistently reported 40Mbps. Using some third party IP test tools I found that while I did get instantaneous 40Mbps, that under regular load the speed dropped dramatically, to the point of connections being dropped all together. I guess there is a huge difference between speed and bandwidth.The devices have been disconnected and I ran Ethernet instead.These devices are definitely not ready for primetime."
4,Great,"Got it delivered fast, plugged it in and it instantly worked. Get speeds of around 50-70 Mbit/s which is plenty fast considering my 100 Mbit/s router gives somewhere around there or slower. It works with my MAC filtering on my router no problem. The MAC address of these devices didn't even need to be entered into the router. As far as it's concerned, there is no extra devices in the network. Nice."
4,It just works - YMMV,"I needed to stream music, photos, video, etc from the home network to the home theater (ShowCenter) and running cable wasn't a good option. While wireless can do a lot, when it comes to streaming video, it just isn't a good option.I picked up an HDX101 kit to give this a shot and haven't looked back. I get stable 40+mbps and video streams without a problem. Basic networking shouldn't be a problem at all.Setup takes minutes (you just plug them in). They do run very warm but you can rest your hand on them so I don't think it is a huge concern. It is my understanding that performance can vary from outlet to outlet but in my case, it was an excellent solution.I picked up the kit for $159 with free shipping.(I knocked a star off because I don't think you are ever going to get 100mbps up and down and I think they should advertise more realistic numbers)."
2,Good features and quality - bad design,"BT8010 has most of the features you can wish bluetooth stereo headset would have. One of the feature I love and not much advertised is to ability to update headset firmware. BTW, none of the current stereo bluetooth headsets have that feature. Nevertheless, poor and bulky headset design makes it almost impossible to use. I give it two stars only to consider its features. Otherwise it is one of the most inconvenient headsets I ever used."
4,ALMOST PERFECT ! ! !,The Jabra BT8010 is near perfection except for the ear piece that fits into the ear which is TOO LARGE to achieve a comfortable secure fit that doesn't fall out when actively moving about ! ! !
3,Great price good sound not very comfortable,"For the price is an amazing bluetooth headset, the sound is good but not excellent. The earpiece is very small for my big ears :-) and is not very comfortable."
4,cool stuff,"a little big for my hands but otherwise works well. the gloves do a good job and i will replace, if necessary, with the same item."
4,Who Knew? Many Interesting Insights.,"I bought this book in preparation for an upcoming trip to Kenya. Once I got used to his writing style, the book was a quick, interesting read. I learned much about the lives of the Maasai that I did not know plus insights into the missionary schooling. Lekuton is one determined, extraordinary young man! We should all have such strength."
3,"Wasn't What I Expected, But Good","This was not what I expected, however, it was good reading, but sometimes a little confusing. I wasn't expecting the writer to be as laid back as she was, and thought there would be more suggestions on how to's, but it was more of experiences that were shared."
5,window to my soul,"I would just like the chance to thank Merrit for her most wonderful rendition of my experiences. She writes as if she knows me intimately and never have I been so moved to paint, draw and write my own feelings...until the last word on the last page..."
5,Wow,This album is amazing.Mike is a lyrical genious.Each track on this album speaks to me in its own way.I think that everyone needs a copy of this album.
2,"Poor writing, mediocre acting","I must say I was looking forward to this series, but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. I found the writing to be excruciatingly banal and nothing more than elementary. The psychological insight was about what you learned in Psych 101 freshman year in college. Transference? Really? And despite the best efforts of Gabe and Dianne, most of the actors were unable to bring life to the dreary writing. At work we decided about four episodes in that a different cast of exceptional actors could possibly have made good drama of this pablum, but the cast they had just couldn't do it.Overall, a big disappointment not worthy of a second go-round."
3,Working on XP,"Mine crashed on XP following Donna's instructions, but when I used Win98 mode instead of Win95 it worked.Thanks Donna, now my 3 yr old can follow in the footsteps of his older brothers :-)"
5,"Once You Read It, You'll Read It Again","A friend brought me a copy of Red while she visited Oxford. I spent hours with it. This magazine is superb; the articles are well-written and engaging. The only thing that bothered me was the references to certain products, many of which are available only in the UK, with prices listed in pounds. (Yes, I know this is a British magazine but I was mildly annoyed. Call me shallow.) This didn't bother me enough to make me stop reading at any time, however. After the first read, I wanted to read it all again.About the only thing that stops me from ordering a subscription is the high price. Perhaps when I win the Publishers' Clearing House Sweepstakes I will subscribe to Red."
2,BEWARE - the pianist is NOT Rachmaninoff,"I was hoping to get a recording of Rachmaninoff performing the Sonata, but was disappointed when I received the CD. It's pianist Santiago Rodriguez."
2,Going Through the Motions,"There seems to no middle ground on live Jefferson Airplane cd's. I've loved this band for 40 years but this material sounds perfunctory and uninspired to me. I think ""Live at The Fillmore East"" is their best concert cd, followed by ""Live at Monterey."" I also dislike ""BIPLH."""
2,"Yeah, it's...I didn't like it","I wanted to like this book, but it's not really what normal men wear. It's a book written to give knitters something entertaining to knit, but it's a lot more complicated than what most men are willing to wear. Like that picture on the cover. It looks like something the guy bought on a vacation in Ireland and that he'll wear once when he gets home. Nice looking stuff that no one will wear."
1,Horrible Pump,This battery operated Sprayer is completely useless. Liquid simply drips out... No effective spray... Save your money and get a manual pump dispenser.
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I was really looking forward to the release of ""Xecutioner's Return"" and was really hoping for great things because I've been a fan of Obituary since the early days, but unfortunately I found the whole thing a bit flat and ""samey""...in my opinion it's probably comparable to ""Back from the Dead"" like Chris from San Diego wrote in an earlier review. I found that the guitar sounds got a little sludgy and weren't as crisp as say ""Slowly We Rot"" and ""Cause of Death"" (which are probably still two of the best death metal releases out there). It is still Obituary and I'm sure fans will buy it anyway, but I feel their first two releases outshine this one by a long shot...but if you love their later stuff, say from ""Back from the Dead"" onwards, then this'll be right up your alley."
5,Just Get It!!,"I could definitely go on at length about this album!! If you like electronic, chill, lounge or any variation GET THIS ALBUM!! The album has seen more than enough exaltations than need be repeated here just GET THIS ALBUM!! My favorites are The Secret and both Rhodes Times'. Not that the rest of the tracks are not good. Just GET THIS ALBUM!!"
1,These things start falling apart,"After using the first one, when I went to remove it from the bed in the morning, there were little clumps of the lint padding everywhere! What a mess! Go with another company."
1,Beautiful black and white photographs!,I hit 1 star in error and can't edit it! I intended 5 stars! The feminine form is celebrated in this luscious work of photography. Beauty on every page - this oversized volume of black and white photographs is a delight!
5,for my 1974 scout 2,"The B&M Transpak kit can help increase the performance and durability of your stock automatic transmission. By eliminating many restrictive oil flow controls in the transmission's valve body, it allows the transmission to shift more firmly and reduce slippage and shift overlap, providing crisper shifts and reducing wear. Each kit gives you two modes of performance to select from -- heavy duty or hi-performance street. The heavy duty option gives street rods, normal passenger vehicles, and other heavy duty applications a firmer shift feel without a dramatic loss of comfort. The hi-performance street option is similar to the heavy duty option, but the shift is much quicker. Both options retain normal automatic operation when in ""Drive""."
1,Everyone involved in this travesty ought to be ashamed.,"Inept, incomplete, inaccurate. Appallingly uninformed. More errors per square paragraph than anything since the David Shipman and Emily Coleman volumes. To say the authors have absolutely no concept of (or insight to) Garland as performer or persona or human being is to say it all.... Their ""take"" is a total mystery, given the number of at least factually correct books that now exist about her. This is one of the most slapdash, stupidly assembled misfires she's yet had to endure, and everyone from the publishers to the promoters should be horrified they got involved."
2,"WRONG, WRONG, WRONG","There may be Garland biographies more hateful and negative than this one, but few that also contain so many absolute inaccuracies -- dates, sequence of events, mislabeled photos, etc. Author Morley doesn't apparently even know the difference between one of Judy's husbands (Mark Herron) and Liza's (Peter Allen). A wrong-headed hate letter to a performer who deserves better, and isn't here to defend herself. Some nice pictures, even if Morley doesn't always know who the people are."
1,I have to give my view on this awful book,"Oh Oh Oh dear. do not waste your money on this terrible book of rubbish. after the first chapter i had to look at the covber to check whether i was reading about Judy Garland....It is all wrong, the authors get the simplest of detail wrong.I am annoyed that I wasted money buying it.The book seems like it has been written by a 5 year old. It is so incredibly wrong it is laughable.unfortunatly you have to give it a star from 1-5 it doesnt deserve the one star i gave it though.. a complete slap on the face to a wonderful legend"
1,The most anti-Christian book I've ever read!,"This is a very dangerous and discussting book.I have read several books about the topic, and this one, ""Paganism in our Christianity"", is a frontal attack to the roots of the Christian Faith. It negates everything!To the autor, what is in the Bible, and what is in the Christian faith to day is just a collection of lies and fiction events that have never ever occurred!Without Jesus' death on the cross and His resurrection, Christendom has not reason to exist, and the autor of this book, by using similarities and analogies with the Greco-Roman mythology, denies the fundamental bases of the Christian faith: Jesus' death and resurrection to save all those who believe in His message, His sacrifice as the Lamb of God,and His resurrection in order to give us, the believers in Him, the eternal life in heaven.Also, it called my attention that this book has the Free Manson's symbol in its first page...With all due respectIZ"
4,It ain't 3 inches!,"This is a good knive, I just purchased and plan on keeping even though the product description is incorrect! The blade is 2 inches, not 3."
1,Agony,"After three units in my creative writing course, I still have not been able to finish reading a single chapter of this book because all they talk about are things I already know. Anyone who has ever taken an English class in grade school, jr. high, or high school already knows what is written within these chapters. The literary excerpts must have been selected purely for the sadistic entertainment of the poor soul who was forced to buy this book for any college course, because the only joy I derive from this book is reading the horrid excuses for literature selections out loud to others to watch them squirm. This book is what Satan reads to the inhabitants of Hell as a bedtime story.The only reason this book gets even one star is because I cannot submit a review with no stars."
3,Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a Diasporic Community,This work provided and in-depth understanding of cultural context of Cambodian people who live in the USA.Cambodia is an unbelievably complex nation with deep scars. I would have benefitted from inclusion of background context such as the historical religious and political doctrines that that have formed the basis of cultural and societal norm in the present.
2,Constant buffering...,"I love MST 3000, and I enjoyed what I saw. But after 20 minutes the ""buffering"" began...about every 2 minutes. Not the movie's fault."
3,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"This was one of Bolo Yeung's earlier films, defenitely a classic considering the date the movie was made and for a low-budget film it didnt turn out too bad at all. Bolo Yeung is a known and feared fighter all over Hong Kong in the arena known as the kumite. A sensei and ex-champion of the kumite, takes on a new student with a talent for martial arts he decides to put the student in the ring with Bolo. However, the fight didn't go as planned and the student dies in the hands of Bolo who shows no mercy for his opponents. Devestated by the death of his student, the sensei becomes a drunk but then has an encounter with the students now ex-girlfriend reminding him of what has to be done. The sensei gets back into his own training and gets himself ready for the next kumite bout where he will challenge and fight Bolo to the death."
2,A Silly Film,"BLOODFIGHT is really a rehash of several and similar kumite based films. Perhaps a self-ripoff might be a more appropriate term. If one were to compare BLOODFIGHT to BLOODSPORT, then the comparisons stand out, even apart from the titles. Both star Bolo as the Bad Guy who seeks to defend his title in the kumite. Both involve a young fighter who is trained by a grizzled veteran. And both feature a number of preliminary bouts that are at least as interesting as the featured fight. The primary difference is that the young fighter bows out of the film by the midpoint and his place is taken by his sensei. The actors speak in sloooow English and the acting is abysmal. Bolo may look tough but he speaks English in a voice that does not do justice to the word ""muffled."" The plot is paper mache thin and serves only to lead to the climax. This film has no Jean Claude Van Damme to hold the viewer's interest. Bolo, alas, lacks the acting chops to carry BLOODFIGHT on his own. Pass."
1,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","I was excited to see both Risk and Clue in one game. The Risk is pretty good, and I enjoy playing for a short while, but as other reviewers have commented, the AI has no sense of strategy. Battleship seems okay except the AI sure seems like it peeks, since if you start to look like you are winning, it 'finds' your ships in a big hurry. CLUE has NO CLUE. One of the basic tenents of the game is that if you make a suggestion and no one can disprove it (and of course you don't have any of those cards) then that HAS TO BE THE CORRECT ANSWER. Not for this game. That practical idea gets you a loss in a hurry."
5,The best practical guide to caring for multiples!,"I have read this book from cover to cover and once I started reading, I couldn't put it down! I'm expecting twins in about a month and I wish I would have found this book sooner. I have read several other books about twins and multiples and they all covered mostly pregnancy, childbirth, common pregnancy and childbirth complications, and fetal and infant development. Don't get me wrong, that is good information, but none of the other books give as much practical advice as this one. It gives a lot of money saving advice, shortcuts to make certain tasks easier, and even has a chapter with a list of different companies that offer freebies, discounts and coupons specifically for multiples. The author is a mother of tripltes and a singleton, has held officer positions in several twin/multiple clubs and is a twin herself."
4,Required reading for the initiated,"I have finally finished this book. It was pretty slow going, and it put me to sleep many times (I do not recommend reading this before bed if you want to be able to actually digest it.) This book has a lot of good information that reinforces what I have long suspected. It was dry reading much of the time, but that does not make less any of the important albeit controversial ideas (truths gleaned from the very book that is worshipped and misused for the vices of the initiated.) contained within. I was raised as a Christian, and have always felt an emptiness in all the teachings and rituals that I was initiated into. It is a relief that there are others who seek the TRUTH and are willing to share it."
5,"Where for art thou, Jesus","I suppose first off I should divulge that I am an atheist. I have always been facinated by the way people cling to these old myths. I was looking for something of a more scholarly approach to debunking what is common dogma; and I certainly found it in this book. I think the author did a wonderful job of researching and presenting his evidence; in particular, the Epistles of Paul. As the earliest known writings from the supposed time of Christ; there is no mention of anyone from Galilee. Instead we find a divine or spiritual Jesus who is not unlike the pagan myths from that time. Not until the gospel of Mark, written long after (somewhere between 80-120 ce), does he suddenly morph into a terrestrial Miracle Man. I thouroughly enjoyed this book."
4,Pretty good fletching jig,"I've used this now to fletch 1 dozen 11/32"" diameter wood arrows, 1 dozen 5/16"" diamter wood arrows, and a dozen Easton 2117 aluminum arrows. All with turkey feathers, not plastic vanes. It works well for the 11/32"" and the 2117s. I found that the 5/16"" shaft were a little to small to work easily with the E-Z Fletch -- several times it failed to hold the base of a feather against the shaft while the glue set. With this caveat in mind, it works well to correctly align feathers on your arrows while glue dries."
1,Over the edge with boredom!,"In the first few pages the crime is committed. The remaining 250 plus pages are devoted to rehashing the crime; over and over and over again. Although Peter Bergna was convicted of murdering his wife, the reader never finds out his true involvement in her death. Likewise, we're not given a definitive motive. The entire book is speculation, guess work, and accusation. Put together, it makes for a very dull book."
2,Redundancy.,An interesting true crime story whose appeal is diminished by the author's unnecessary repetition of the facts. Story could have been told in half the book's length.
3,"The Voice of the People; Primary Sources on the History of American Labor, Industrial Rrelations, and Working Class Culture","Not as good as I had hoped. However, I enjoyed the book. The book did bring out some thought I had never considered."
1,"Sam Walton,sPromice","I know a long time ago Sam would not let his employees be treated like employees are treated today.Today many are employeed at his Walmart stores are not beeing treated fairly.New assoiates making less money are hired every day to replace their loyal assoiates that have been there through the good and the bad.No one seems to care in management because they to are tring not to get replaced.(Store 1121 for exsample)1121 is laying off loyal assoiates and cutting houres claiming WalMart cant pay them,but hire new ones when we cant live off 20 or less hours.Is Sam Waltons promice rembered now about WalMart beeing a family store?No.The book should make his promice keept say (I hope my promice will be keept.)"
2,so so - too bad,"The chapters alternate between math and historywith history being the stronger of the two. In termsof mathematics, the author creates difficulties forhimself immediately by introducing the RH via the zetacomplex zeroes instead of the simpler and more naturalversion via prime numbers. Much harder to explain,however, is the absence of the dramatic and importantwork of Levinson [showing that the RH is at least""one third true""]. The book was completed in a hurry(it shows) and would have benefited from better editing."
1,"Not too impressed by ""Obsession""","Want to know about Riemann? Read Riemann!In Amazon, this book is recommened by a Nobel Prize winner in Economics!The entire Western world is going down the toilet. The East is rising. Higher education is a sore. Nuclear energy is outlawed. The economic works of George Wasington... banned! No one in public life has shown the way to prosperity, jobs and a ctdible belief in the future. People in Europe do not have to have children anymore.Etc. What is Amazon doing? Promoting more of the same. A parallel comes to mind. Chistine Lagarde, the IMF Head, blames the usual government policies for the Transaltantic mess!! Her proposal: More of the same!Sorry, your ""Onsession"" book.. no, I am not buying... regards... ra"
1,Who is this for?,"This is another of those books that thinks the only people who are interested in math are those who know a lot about it. I couldn't be bothered sitting down with the author's technical chapters and working out what it all means. He could have tried a lot harder to carry with him the average reader, like me. In the end, because he doesn't make the math very clear I ended up being less interested in the more general chapters too. I guess i should try one of the other two books on this subject that are around at the moment. Other non-math majors seem to think they are easier and more interesting."
4,My first review,"Really good book for beginners,it explains basic concepts for all audiences, the way of mixing history and concepts is original (i preferThe Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics) , but sometimes slow for advanced readers.ugly/strange typography of ecuations and errors."
3,Almost as Good as Magic Power,This book is good but I loved Vernon Howards book The Magic Power of Command Transmission. I can't find it anymore and would love to buy it. Any suggestions?
5,Great,My dad asked for this for Christmas. The DVD came in orignal wrapping and was quick to arrive. I would do business with the company again.
3,"Middle of the Road, But the Models, Poor","If I had a chance to physically review this book in person before purchase, I would have passed on it. As stated, middle of the road as far as creativity and inspiration of designs offered. What really disappointed me was the quality of the models used. One clock requires many dados, sadly, only a few in the photo are even close to being square and flush. A modern clock features dowels that are out of round and other models show rough edges, minor splinters and paint brush marks. I'm no master woodworker by any means, a newbie at clock box making, and I'll build a few of the designs. As stated in another review, its a book of mostly basic plans without a lot of inspiration. The book however has inspired me to build the clocks better than the models pictured."
5,Excellent investment!,"I recommend this book to every one of my students, from beginners to undergrads in college. The selection of pieces is extensive, and includes many standards in the oboe repertoire, including the Handel sonatas, the Schumann romances and the Mozart Oboe Quartet (entitled Sonata for Oboe and Piano in this book). The oboe parts are paired with piano scores; buying these pieces separately would cost a lot, so this is an incredible steal. There are also many pieces that are wedding-appropriate, for those oboists that are looking for a collection of pieces to play at such an event. A great resource and investment for all oboists!"
4,not as hot as reviews say,considering it specs it should have clearer video and better still pictures than it does but not too terribly bad. just remember that Sams has them for 57.61 every day now
3,Decent webcam,"I am in the desktop video conferencing business. As such I find it puzzling why any webcam would need over 30 FPS. In most cases, you just can't tell the difference. That said, I still found the full-motion video quality to be quite good with this camera. I don't like the design of the housing, it didn't mount very securely to either my desktop LCD or my laptop LCD. Overall, this is a fine webcam, but for the money, I'd go with something else."
2,High Quality Video But No Sound,"I bought two of these so that my daughter and I could see and hear each other over the Internet, neither of us are able to get sound. She has Win XP and I have Win Vista."
3,"Sturdy, well-made but drivers need updating.","I have used a generic webcam (free from Earthlink ages ago), then ""upgraded"" to another generic ""Digigr8"" gooseneck CMOS sensor webcam. I have to say I am pleased with this Philips CCD sensor webcam. The picture is crisp and sharper than the previous ones used -- you certainly get what you pay for! My favorite feature is the face-tracker; it zooms in automatically if you lean back on your chair, and zooms back out if you come too close to the camera. My only peeve about this is the number of times you have to reboot after installing the drivers but even then, the ones on the CD provided were somewhat outdated. It's not a difficult task to download the drivers off the Philips website, however."
1,Returning my 3rd one,"Viewsonic seems to have a serious quality control problem. Bought 2 for a great price, one wouldn't work at all. Returned it, and the next one they sent was in a scotch-taped together box. It obviously didn't work properly either, so sent it back. Kept one, nice tv, but now about half the time when you turn it on, nothing happens, have to unplug it and the plug it back in. So it's going back, too.And by the way, the fact that other remotes won't learn View Sonic's remote is a HUGH problem (just ask my wife)"
3,"The TV gets 5 stars, Customer Service gets 1 star","Bought this TV, the remote doesn't work properly. Have to get up to change channels & volume, can't switch over to other inputs, can't access settings, etc.After contacting customer support (had to call numerous times, never got the promised call-back, long wait times, etc) I was told that they have no replacement remotes in stock and I'd have to wait until they get them in stock. Rather than return the whole item (I am entitled, but it's a pain and the TV is fine) I said I was willing to accept a universal remote, while I wait. They can't send me a universal and can't even recommend one that works w/ this TV.It's been three weeks and I'm still waiting and very frustrated."
1,Hasn't Kids Music Grown UP,"I can't believe any kid over 3 would ever listen to this album. This is not music for kids, it's music that grown ups who don't like music think is what kids should listen to. I'm sorry, it may have been sweet when Mr. Rogers sang these songs as part of his show but these overproduced celebrity sung songs are unbearable. Where is the humor? Where is the kids point of view. WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? I can't believe 13,000 people would spend a Saturday morning listening to this as they did last summer to Ralph's World. Not only do artists like Ralph Covert and Justin Roberts sing music that speaks to kids, but they sing music that brings the kid out of all of us. This music may be great to put on while little Billy chews on his blocks, but forget about it being played ever again once they reach 6 years old. And me and my daughters will still be ""Surfing to Our 'Our' Imaginations"", 50 years from now."
1,falls apart,spikes unglue quite easilyso you wind up unscrewing cornand spikes togetherthen have to keep glueing onnot well designed.
5,Captivating!,"This toy encourages creativity and imagination. I love doing it with my grandchild. At first, she was hesitant to jump in, but when she saw how easy it was, she joined right in and came up with the most beautiful patterns and amazing designs all by herself."
4,Great small gas tank,I bought this gas tank for my John boat. Its great because it smaller and fits behind my seat.Very well made and came with a gauge. I had to remove the gauge assembly to install my connector fitting but it was not a big deal. The plastic is very thick and should hold up well.
3,A slight disappointment,"Be aware that you cannot use this cable to charge 2 low voltage devices at the same time. You can ONLY charge one high-voltage device and one low-voltage device at the same time, which mean you can't charge your iPod and your cell phone simultaneously."
3,NO LONGER WORKS,"not sure how they figure this has anything to do with a 5.1 system. i did buy it to use with a dj controller (Hercules E2) and it works fine for that - so no complaints... it does look a bit ""mickey mouse"" but works fine.EDIT.after using it about 10 times it now no longer works. you get what you pay for i guess."
5,Great Product A++,"Really nothing special but for the price - WOW, what more can you ask for. I used it for an old lap top that the sound card died in and at was totally plug and play."
1,The Go Bad Fast,"I purchased three of these, they all went bad within a few weeks. Now they're useless. STAY AWAY"
1,never worked,"I'm on a mac, so that might be the problem but this never worked for me. I guess that's what happens when you buy things on the cheap!"
1,Worked great until it broke a month later.,"Not much to say about such a simple device, other than it broke after a month of use plugged in without any movement."
5,Virtual 5.1-surround USB 2.0 External Sound Card,Works great. Good purchase and terrific price. Love shopping on Amazon. Will shop Amazon every chance I get. Would recommend to anyone who has a traditional mini jack headset which will work good with this product.
2,Just ok,Bought this to use with Virtual DJ Home so I could listen to the song being cued up. It works but when used with my Klipsch speakers the sound is very unclear and makes me want to throw this thing away. But it works with my headphones and the quality doesn't matter much to me. For the price you can't beat it.
3,Works & cheap!,"I thought it would be 5.1 but it wasn't, I think it's still a great deal for the price! If you are thinking of buying these so called 5.1 surround sound, I would say get some better ones. You can get a better one for about 20$ with alot more options but then again it's only $1.68!"
2,Not very good.,My experience with this sound card was very poor. I purchased two and neither one worked well. Don't do it!
1,Almost Worthless,"It barely functions and the volume is inconsistent when low. At any higher volumes it crackles horribly and will eventually stop working. I bought it to replace a mostly broken headphone jack in my laptop, but it turned out to be even worse. There is no situation where I would want to use this item. If you have ANY alternatives, use them before this."
3,Its got problems,"This thing works well for me, but I found within a few uses that it was starting to bend and it actually popped apart several times with me just grabbing it to take it out of my usb port on my laptop. I watched a video on here posted by another buyer and he said to take it apart and clamp the two metal prongs loacated next to the usb tip down, something I feel the company should have done so obviously no quality control if every piece sold is like this. I did that and it feels much more stable now. You can also super glue it like he said and it makes the whole thing more stable. Overall it works for my purpose of having use of a microphone headset for skype since my laptop only has one port for headphone/mic."
2,USB External Sound Card,ok for the price. I have noticed that my headphones get hot after a little while and that makes me feel uncomfrtable.
1,Worked for 10 seconds.,Plugged into my win7 pc and was not recognized.Put in my laptop and it was recognized.Put it back in my pc and it lit up for about 10 seconds then died and was not recognized ever again.It seems too loose due to weight to make a good connection.
4,works great till......,i had to give it time to install it and it does work on usb 1.1 dont ask why i havent upgraded i just dont feel like it right now but it plays a lot better than the integrated intl i have got for sure it just distorts at a loud volume.. but not this thing. feels of cheap but good quality.. dont be rough with it is the key here... other than that im happy but one stand out problem the microphone part doesnt wanna work its just a wave in thats it.... so other than that it works..Update.. This thing is really loud!!! I never could get the on board audio to play this loud through my headphones.. And the best part is it doesn't distort until you have it at a low volume.. I love my music loud and proud it really is a good purchase just don't handle it rough that's the key in all electronics not all are indistrucable!...... ok it broke last month and it wont recognize at all anymore..
3,Wouldn't recommend.,"I got this because my internal sound card was no longer working.Granted, it's better than nothing, especially for the price but it's nothing special.It has a lot of static and it's EXTREMELY loud, when I have my volume set to '1'But I'm just happy I can hear something from my computer."
5,Best ever !,I am not savvy in computers and in the place I live it is difficult to find an honest technician. I spent too much trying to fix the audio of my computer with no successful. The USB CHANNEL 3D is an excellent option and works real good!
3,good n cheap,"Bought this to try to force my Mac/hack to use USB sound for an old speaker I had, but didn't really work. Seems usable, otherwise, though very cheaply made…for the price, its good-n-cheap ;)"
3,not understand,"still have this just don't know excactly no how to use it,sorry not your fault mine foe being nutty and bloonde"
2,you get what you pay for,this product works but the case fell apart when i removed from package. i recommend you pay a few bucks more and get the $6 one it is a lot more solidly built and doesnt feel so cheap. it also fit the USB socket alot more solidly.
2,You Get what you pay for,"Might make it 5 minutes with thing before It gets too hot, and begins to sound muddy. Suggest investing in a nicer one."
1,USB Audio Adapterr,"I purchased this unit to solve a problem with audio in my laptop. I could not get it to work, even though it appeared that a driver for it was downloaded and installed. I updated the drivers in the laptop and that solved the initial internal audio problem so I did not need this non-working usb device after all."
2,Good for 20 Days,"Somehow I broke the headphone jack in my laptop (so that it only plays out one earphone). Rather than buying a new headset, I bought this little thing, so I could plug my good headset in via USB.It did what it was supposed to do--the sound quality was not stellar, but I was mostly using it for conference calls so I didn't mind much. I did disable my internal sound card, but I still got background static once in awhile.Then, 20 days after I first installed it on my computer, it completely quit working. The red light stopped lighting up, and no sound would play. I tried it in three USB slots and two different computers, my husband even took it apart to see if something had come loose, but no dice. For two bucks I can't really complain, but since it only worked for 20 days, I'm going to suck it up and buy a USB headset now."
1,DO NOT WASTE your time or money- If you need something that works or is of any time lasting quality,"I knew they were shitty to say the least, I even bought two to ensure that I will have a backup for if and WHen one breaks. To say the least, both expired within the course of a week. ( not counting weekends)Throw in a couple of extra dollars because with electronics, you're better off making one good purchase and not bothering with this ever again."
5,Great book! Hope to read the rest soon! :),"This is a great book! If you have read this and you haven't read the ""Alex Rider Series"" read them! I liked this better than the ""Alex Rider Series"", but most people didn't. They are so cool! you should read them all!:)"
4,fabric artist,This book is a great way to challenge your color and design knowledge. I recommend this book for any quilter who wants help learning more about color and design.
4,So far so good.,"I haven't used these long enough to tell if they're helping or not, since plantar fasciitis won't go away overnight. I can say they're comfortable to use in those shoes they do fit in. They're a little too big for most of my shoes, but they fit perfectly into my asics gel. Also, the fabric cover is soft enough to use without wearing socks on other shoes.So far so good."
4,Can't live without them,My husband has been using this product for 2 years. He absolutely loves them. For the price it is a good buy! He stopped complaining of back pain.
3,Comfortable but doesn't correct for flat feet and pronation,"These are comfortable for walking and running straight ahead but they don't provide enough support for flat feet and pronated ankles. Also, the cover is too slippery to play tennis in and so I slide around in them which is not comfortable."
5,Best on the market,"I taught school for 30+ years on hard concrete floors and developed arch and heal pain. My wife recommended these inserts after many years of nursing and she was right, these are the very best inserts on the market. They do exactly what they say they will do."
3,Not For Every Shoe,"Overall, this is a great product on full arch support, especially those who need it for the majority of the foot, who have arch or toe issues. Yet, every time I put the insert in a shoe, it lifted me too much in the heel that I kept slipping out. I have small feet and slip out of most shoes anyway. (And yes, I have tried the fancy lacing in the extra hole at the top of running shoes. It doesn't help.) The heel cup was designed to grip your heel and keep it in place, but does not work for me. It should if you have a more normal size foot, but don't quote me on that. Also, this one is more pliable than the original Powerstep insert. If you need a little give on your insert, this would likely be the better option."
5,Great purchase!,"I have a high arch and fat feet. Seriously. I know how it sounds.I use one pair in my work shoes and the other pair in my workout shoes. Both are awesome! My feet feel less tired and achy, and my arches feel fine. One thing I will say is that no foot support will help you if you are on your feet for 4 hours plus without sitting down. Seriously. If you are a nurse, teacher, waiter/tress, retail worker, etc., pair these with compression socks and your life will be easier."
3,Well made for price.,"These are the same brand insoles my podiatrist gave me, but these are better made. For my feet anything is worth a try."
4,Good product,"The Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic Insert fit immediately, without trimming, and was comnfortable to the foot right from the start. My only critisism would be that it cost more than what I paid the last time I bought the product in a sports store."
2,Comfortable but poor quality.,"I used these for 1.5 months before the top fabric liner began to fall off. I contacted the manufacture of the product and they replaced them for free (I paid to ship the defective ones back). The manufacture said they have been getting complaints of the liner failing recently. My second pair is also already beginning to fail after only a few weeks. They are very comfortable but just unusable when the top liner falls off and balls up under your heels. I will attempt to repair my second pair with glue, but i would certainly not buy these again."
1,Returned,"Once I put these in my shoes, I could no longer get my foot in my shoes without horrible pinching. I returned them."
2,OK flashlight,"Was slightly disappointed with this flashlight. It is a black and white camouflage LED that is plenty bright when it works. It may be just bad luck with the one we received, but when the battery cover is fully tightened, it doesn't function. Have to unscrew it slightly and then it works well. Otherwise it is the perfect size and weight especially for kids to use. Just frustrates them a bit if it isn't working because the cover was bumped too tight and needs adjusting."
3,mixed opinion,I did pick up a lot of interesting information from the book. But I agree with another review that the writing style got me confused more than once.The book might be helpful but you may have to read it 3-4 times to understand it.
1,Do not Buy this Product!,How do you spell cheap..... buy the Gruppe 83900 Weather Station and find out for yourself... It looks good but doesn't work except for the temperature gauge. Made in Germany....The craftsmanship is a disgrace and the company who made this should be ashamed of themselves. If anyone wants mine they will have to go to the garbage dump.
4,"Shreds well, difficult to empty","While this unit shreds well, the hopper is difficult to empty, as the shred unit must be lifted off, and there is no handle or indentation to do so. I have recently seen another brand unit similarly priced at Costco with a hopper that completely pulls out like a drawer for emptying."
2,PASS,"Ours lasted for 5 months. The ""cross-cut"" feature is way more secure, although if it's broken??? Go with Fellowes Powershred PS-77C."
1,Do Not Purchase This Shredder,I purchased this shredder 2 weeks ago after having one like it for 5 years. It lasted less than 50 sheets of shredding before breaking and is not repairable so it was a complete waste of money and shipping/tax.Since it is not in new condition it is not returnable.The shredder is poorly made and also very difficult to feed.I will never purchase another of this brand.
1,Don't waste your money,"There's not that much information, and the photos youhave seen in other books with alot more information.Don't waste your money."
2,Elvis the personal Archives,"First I guess it would be important to say that I've been an Elvis fan for about 30 something years. So the low rating is not because I'm one of those out to bash the King etc. Far from it. I absolutely treasure him and have many thousands of dollars worth of books and memorabilia. With that out of the way, I expected this book to be full of rare, never before seen pics of Elvis's prized possessions etc, like his crayon box from grade school, Graceland contract etc. Boy was I disapointed! There are a few pictures of his shirts, handguns, badges and ID cards and some other minor items. Some I've seen before and thats it! Just a few. It seems the layout of the book was intended to be more of a modern art project than any real look at the King's many possessions. You're better off buying an Elvis auction guide. Much better layout, presentation and jam packed with photos of his personal items etc. You can still find them available on Ebay. Hope this helps."
2,Broken,"Overall it LOOKS alright. Won't be able to see it in use until my dad opens it on Christmas, but when I took it out of it's package upon arrival, I see the bottom part is cracked. Fixable, but I paid $30 for a good feeder, not a broken one. Better packaging recommended."
2,Handle pops off,"The cheaply made handle often pops off, may cause a person to drop carrier. I work for the humane society and care for animals in transit at the airport and have seen many pets dropped and injured due to cheaply made / attached handles, I have a pile in a corner of handles that have broken off."
2,I've had lots better ...,"I purchased this crate because of the ease of collapsing, and setting up. It's OK, but I wouldn't purchase again. The snap down system isn't the best. I have a 10 lb dog. He was in the crate, when I picked it up by the handle to move it over slightly. The whole thing opened up. It's also difficult to line up the door properly. It's just cheaply made. I'd suggest buying, only if you're going to keep it in a set area, and leave it there."
2,YogaMama,I sent this crate back because it was not sturdy. I worried that the bottom would fall out and my puppy would hit the ground.
4,Works great,"The only problem I had in using this to send a cat cross country,was that the airlines require you to screw the top and bottom of the carrier together they will not just let you use the fasteners as they are. I would also recommend buying the petmate airline travel kit with it. It has all the stickers you need for the crate, as well as a absorbent pad for the bottom of the crate, but mainly because the food and water dish that come with the carrier was way to small so you will need the bigger ones that come with the air travel kit."
1,Beautiful picture/ 3 Repeated failures & failed replacements/ Terrible CS,"I loved my viewsonic PJ458D. I loved it until I had it about a month and the red light began blinking notating overheating. I sent it in and 3 months passed while the warranty and repair tried to work out the issues. During this time, I spent hours on hold and got nowhere with any information; basically I was told nobody knew anything. Finnally, they sent me a replacement. 3 months passed and the same issue has again occurred again. I spend 2 1/2 months awaiting a new unit; it did eventually arrive. Now after 4 more months, the latest unit has again failed. I don't think I'm going to send it in again. I have honestly spent more time without the projector working than I have since I bought it. I would recommend Viewsonic, but please purchase a different model."
1,plastic blade lock wears out,"I saw the Kershaw factory on Modern Marvels. Amazing factory and materials. But to put a cheap plastic blade lock in this knife that wears out after all this excellent crafting? Also, screws are torqued too tight for the user to change the pocket clip position. Screws strip."
5,Helen... a professioanl at what she does.,"Helen Lee not only knows the beauty business for its beauty, but knows what it takes to look and feel your best. Helen wrote this book to share her beauty secrets with women and men all over the country. Being successful in the modeling business, Helen went on to become a business women in the world of beauty and is a professioanl at what she does."
4,Good Plasma for Great Price,"I just received this television yesterday. I was a little concerned about the sound quality as I have seen it being bashed by reviewers. However, bottom line, the t.v. sounds just fine. You may need a minute to get used to the sound coming from behind or behind/side of the t.v., but I think that has more to do with the reviews warning about the sound, then the sound quality itself. I must warn you that this is my experience with the t.v., just sitting on a stand AND NOT MOUNTED TO A WALL. I would reccomend this t.v. to anyone looking for a good deal on a plasma."
4,Decent TV for the price,"I caught it at a very low price (below $600), so I figured what the heck. Decent picture and all, but was slightly confused about the HDTV support. Even though it can read HDTV signals, ends up it can only display in EDTV (480), not HDTV (1080)."
1,Not all that and especially not a bag of chips.,"I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of mine which I ordered Jan 17th. It arrived broken so I refused shipment, which was no problem. Then my husband happened to be at Sam's Club that day, looking at TVs noticed this exact same set on sale there. Boy, was I glad mine arrived broken, because of all the sets on display at Sam's this 6842PE had the worst picture. BTW - I know Amazon's prices usually are great, but in this case not so much, the price at [...] was $[...]."
5,Unbelievable for the price!,i was one of the lucky ones who got this unit for $699 with free shipping. Excellent picture. HDTV stations are perfect and dvd's are awesome. Absolutely georgous screen even when compared with other plasmas and LCD's. I have it hooked up to my Sony home theatre system and it sounds great. Best deal I've purchased in years. Even at $799 this unit is a good deal.
4,good value for the price,I've had a good overall experience with this TV. The only reason I did'nt give it five stars was because of the lack of an optical input and the poor speakers.
5,Music to Watch Lightning By,"Unlike Joan (first review) I am not native. The music speaks to me in powerful ways, however, especially when watching distant nocturnal thunderstorms. It touches me equally on cold winter nights. It is peaceful, calming, and full of wonderful rhythms and melodies. Gary does a marvelous job of creating musical sounds that joyfully mimic many sounds of nature. I heartily recommend this to anyone seeking to calm their inner spirit, or if already calm, to lift themselves. This is my first Stroutsos album-but not my last."
4,Outsmart your cancer,"Interesting book, full of information for cancer treatments. Just wish there was a way to check out some of the information as I just heard a rebuttal about Protocel."
2,Outsmart your Cancer,"My husband believed in this book, the disk of people who swore by this product and that they are cancer free and the product, protocel, which he purchased and only got to use 1/2 the bottle before he died 9-26-12. I didn't believe. I don't think you should either do your own research on protocel with your doctor."
5,A must read,"Simply put this book is much better than the like book which is out ""Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About."" Gives you at least twice the information with out the sales pitches in the NC book and all at a price which is more than fair."
2,Didn't work as well as old set of rabbit ears,"with my old set of rabbit ears, and an automatic channel search on a new DTV set, I got over 20 analog channels and 30 or so digital channels (some of which are HD). there are a few drop-outs when the weather is stormy, but reception gets even better after the sun goes down. I bought this picture frame antenna because it looks so much nicer than the rabbit ears, and had hoped for similar if not better peformance than the old antenna ...... while the picture frame antenna worked OK, it did not receive as many channels (of either digital or analog). Kind of a high price ($39) for no significant difference ......"
3,Difficult to install,"Installed using the quick guide and could not get my computer to recognize the base unit. After trial and error I found that my anti virus software was blocking it on my network. There is a installation DVD that actually describes this but doesn't do it in detail. Then I needed to set up my router differently to set it up for ""on the go"" use (hotspots, and remote).After getting it up and running, the picture quality was really bad. I adjusted the ""rate"" manually and it works pretty well, with average picture quality. I can control my Tivo using the remote on-screen.I have yet to use it ""on the go"" at a hotspot, but I will try that next.I bought this instead of the slingbox even though it's cheaper, because it's a Sony. I'm not sure if the picture quality is better with a slingbox.I would rate it a 3 out of 5 because of the difficult installation."
4,gadget guy,"Works well though instructions can be a tad confusing. Works perfectly with the PSP. I have not been able to control my unit via the web yet as Sony doesn't have the all the codes (they do have quite a bit, however)for Direct TV."
3,"Great for XP and PSP, Terrible for Windows 7","This is a pretty cool gadget if you're still working with Windows XP or you own a PSP. Picture quality is decent. I looks kinda choppy at times, but in the all around, it's nice. From time to time, I hear what I would describe as a bird chirping noise. On the downside. I struggled for a very long time trying to get this to work with Windows 7. The software it comes with won't install at all, and the software you download from Sony will install, but not work. Even with all settings correct, the picture freezes. I even connect straight from my computer, to the base (around the router/internet) and I was still having this problem. I tried this on two seperate (new) computers running Windows 7 with the same results. In conclussion. This + Windows XP/PSP = good buy. Any other operating system at all = avoid.PS, this does not work with a PS3 (unless you want to deal with crazy port forwarding stuff that would confuse the crap out of 99% of all users)"
1,This bundle contains an obsolete base unit - order at your own risk,"The product is great, but be aware that they are unloading obsolete base units in this bundle, and consequently you may not be able to find a compatible player. I purchased the LF-PK1 bundle in Mar07 because of the new low price. It does work great. But when I purchased the windows phone player for my cellphone I found it wouldn't work because this ""brand new unit"" contains the old LF-B1 base unit, and the windows phone players only support the new LF-B20 base unit (with no plays to support the old obsolete LF-B1). True, the unit works from laptop players and from my PSP, but there's no compatible windows phone player (while my slingbox plays flawlessly from my phone)."
3,Hard Revenge Milly,"I don't think these films will reach cult status like Versus but I still enjoyed them. Don't look for deep plot or character development here, this is strictly for action junkies and gore hounds. It's your typical revenge story but the action scenes are well done. The gore FX and wire work are also good even on a limited budget. Some of the acting is a little over the top but the main lead handles herself pretty well. What you get is two one hour films on a one sided disc with a documentary for each film. The two documentaries are interesting and are almost as long as the films. So if you liked Samurai Princess or machine girl you may want to give this one a try."
5,"if you are caring for elderly parents, this book is a must","This book affords those caring for parents the wisdom of those who have been through it and is an essential resource for those of us finding all of a sudden that our parents need us. It affords important info re sources of help, important advice as to how to overcome the emotional problems so inherent in caring for elderly parents' needs, and it imparts experiences that everyone in our generation is in the same boat and can learn from one another."
3,Aceptable,"La historia sobre cómo asesinan al hijo de dios siempre será interesante, pero creo que este libro se limita a hacerle modificaciones a los tan conocidos cuentos de la biblia, lo que me parece poco ingenioso e imaginativo. Resalto positivamente la gran investigación histórica del periodo expuesto, y negativamente el montaje de la historia. Buen libro para quienes quieren conocer un poco mejor la leyenda de Jesús."
5,I WANT TO TRAVEL TO,"I've read the book and I am extremelly surprise and happy too, for me it was not a book, it was a real travel to the past and the real truth about the Jesus' life. So you don't read a book you make your soul grow."
2,Ivory ???,"I bought this tie for my husband to wear for our wedding. The description says it is ivory, but it is actually champagne. The tie itself is beautiful and very high quality, but it's just not the color they say it is. I was disappointed."
3,"A cartoon BASED on ""Anne of Green Gables""","There are ways this cartoon is cute, because it is BASED on ""Anne of Green Gables."" But... and this is a big but.... BUT.... so much is changed and added, if you're a real ""Anne of Green Gables"" enthusiast you will be very disappointed. It's cute and fun for someone who has never experienced any other ""Anne of Green Gables,"" but for those of us who have this cartoon is a real let-down."
5,Fantastic Knife,"This knife is fantastic! The blade and tip are super sharp. It is easy to open with one hand. I am a fan of purple, so the ""rainbow"" colors make it a fun knife. I do not recommend this knife for men because it would be difficult to open with a big hand due to its slipperiness. The safety works great and it fits nicely into women's standard jean pockets. Kershaw has made a wonderful knife for women, pretty, sturdy and sharp."
3,Six Degrees of Connections,"Although enjoyable, this is not James Burkes best work. This does indeed seem more like ""Six Degrees of Connections"" at times. Without revealing any sequences here, there are cases that demonstrate Burke's ""Trigger Effect"". Unfortunately there are too many (for my taste anyway) cases of Mr. X was working on this invention and then he was walking on the sidewalk across from Mr. Y who became famous for something completely different. Because this work concentrates on torturously linking together people rather than connecting the innovations the narrative tends to blend together."
5,I was not disapointed.,"The only drawback I could find for this book was the big size of the edition, since it wasn't as convenient to carry around as it would be on a separate book for each part.This novel is so well written that even a European reader like myself does not get intimitated by the New York slang. The plot is captivating and the heroes alive.Those who have seen the movie can only admire the way the script has respected the spirit of the book. And those who haven't will still feel as though the images come alive on every sentence."
1,Poor packaging,"This item is beautiful, but it arrived with one of the glass panels broken. Better packaging would have prevented this from happening."
4,Almost a great buy,"This product is beautiful. And even though it was missing the manzanita branch, I have ordered a second one. The missing branch seems to be a problem with other peoples orders also. Is it on purpose so the maker can save some money, who knows? I hope I don't get ripped off with the second one. Now I have to hunt down a branch or two from somewhere else, and pay more money, to someone else, just to complete the product that should have been complete in the first place."
4,Remember this is not a bird feeder!,"I bought the Butterfly House months ago and just got around to unpacking it. The directions that came with it explain how to fill it with birdseed!! So, back I came to the Amazon page and got the real directions of what to do with it. This is a beautiful product and it's very well made. I can't wait to find just the right spot for it and see it at work."
5,Excellent Phonics Book for Homeschoolers,"I've used this book to begin teaching each of my children phonics. It progresses from short vowels, consonants, blends, long vowel words and so on. By the end of the book they really have mastered basic decoding skills. For some of my younger students or those not ready for the handwriting involved, they were able to draw lines from words to pictures and then trace shaded words later."
1,So Many Bugs,This game is an awful disappointment. There are bugs in the game that make it impossible to play the game directly. For example in Sorry I had a piece in home and one of the opponents were able to bump in back to start just by landing on the space next to home. Also the aggrivation game glitchs half way through and won't let you out of start even if you roll the right number. Don't waste your money
3,like the debut album more...it is upbeat,"No denying their talent and vocal skills, but I like their debut more with fast dance and beats vice the downtempo ballads and at times maudlin songs."
3,"The hits are good, but there's not much else","""On Bended Knee"" was one of the best songs of the mid-90s, and ""Water runs Dry"" ranks up there as well. The only problem is, once you get past the four hits on the album (""I'll Make Love to You"" and ""Thank You"" being the other two), there's not much else to listen to. The cover of ""Yesterday"" is the best to date; even better than the Ray Charles version. But the only other songs worth mention are the sincere ""I Sit Away"" and the decent, but really long ""Jezzebel."" Everything else is miserably bad. I would suggest the next two albums by the Boyz, unless you can finds this one used."
5,"Never heard this album, obviously.","Boyz II Men are a perfect example of the kind of artists you would have to put on to relax, on a par with the likes of Sade (obviously one of my mother's favorite jazz females, not mine), Kenny G, Céline Dion, and the incredible Andrea Bocelli. However, I never heard this album except for ""I'll Make Love To You,"" that sexy, super popular ballad. This was written and produced (?) by Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, who sang a very beautiful song called ""Never Keeping Secrets"" many years ago. Maybe these guys will get their next album on the move by the time their world tour ends."
2,Safe and Non-Threatening,"Middling second album has the boyz in top vocal form, but the material they work with here is very, VERY average. ""I'll Make Love to You"" is a safe, radio-friendly, G-rated ballad courtesy of Babyface, and even Jam and Lewis stumble on the through-the-motions ""On Bended Knee."" Only on ""Water Runs Dry"" do things get a bit interesting. It sold a gazillion copies, but does that really speak for album's quality? Boyz II Men's sophomore offering is not quite a disaster, but it's a very dull record that plays by the rules and does nothing more. Is that supposed to be progress?"
4,Lots of fun but not so practical,"Its lots of fun to design the clothes. You can spend hours and hours having fun creating new outfits then seeing them come to life using the fashion show option. However actually printing your dress and trying to fashion it onto Barbie is very difficult, frustrating, expensive, and hardly ever looks as great on real Barbie than it did on digital Barbie, which of course can be expected. Still, I would recommend the product for all the fun it provides, as long as you use it as a game rather than a practical clothing making tool."
3,Barbie Fashion,"I used this product when I was younger, the graphics aren't that great but it's alot of fun for alot of little girls. I recently bought it for my younger sister and she never wants to turn it off."
5,The Ellery Queen Mystery Series.,"I absolutely love it !! I wish it had lasted more than one season! Not only do great old TV stars like George Burns, Betty White, and Jim Backus guest star, but you'll find movie stars like Vincent Price, Donald O'Connor and Ray Milland in it as well! It's set in the late 1940's, just after the end of WWII. If you like the classic days of tv and movies you""ll love this tv series!! TV shows the way they used to be --well done!! Jim Hutton as Ellery Queen is fantastic as the absent- minded dectective/mystery author who asks us at the end of each episode, ""do you know who did it yet?"" Then he reviews the clues for you!! Have fun solving the mysteries right along with Ellery Queen and his dad, Inspector Richard Queen of the NYPD !!!!!!!"
2,Adventure of the Mysterious Motive,"I question the motive of releasing this set. All of the episodes listed on this 'new' set are included on last year's Ellery Queen mysteries set with 6 discs. That set was very reasonable in price (particularly if you visit discount stores) so what's the point? I gave this only 2 stars because even though the series is wonderful, this 'mini' set is redundant and suspiciously looks like greed!"
5,Ellery Queen Mysteries,"love these mysteries...fun to follow what is going on, lots of intrigue and lots of stars...highly recommend to mystery buffs."
3,Didn't quite hit the mark,"This book had a similar hero to ""When Angels Fall"" in that Edward like Ivan was a tortured character, but Edward was missing a certain depth. It seemed like Meagan McKinney was aiming for the same effect, but came up short. It was a pleasant read in that the story held together, but there wasn't any of the same anticipation."
2,Not Ms. McKinney's best,"I have read all of Ms. McKinney's books and liked all of them, up until this one. Throughtout the entire story I couldn't figure out why Lavina and Edward would even be attracted to eachother (besides looks of course) It was awful! I almost put the book down and didn't finish, but decided to take the time to see if it got any better. It didn't. I almost gave it one star, but it did have a few qualities. I hope the next book is better."
3,"Adequate, but I like the Humax HFA100 better","Performance was disappointing after reading all the positive reviews. I purchased the T451 at Circuit City for $150. I live in line of sight of area's main transmission tower and have a good Channel Master outdoor antenna; so most channels come in at 90-100%. T451 picture quality was excellent at both 480p and 1080i settings. Unfortunately the T451 would reboot for no apparent reason. AC3 often wouldn't sync with video (sound-picture like old Kung Fu movies). Channel changing was excruciatingly slow. Electronic Program Guide (EPG) was nearly worthless. I returned it to CC after three weeks and was provided with a no hassle refund.I replaced it with a Humax HFA100 that I bought at Frys for $206. Picture quality of the T451 seems slightly better. However, the HFA100 changes channels quickly, seems to have better overall reception, has a pretty good EPG, and so far has had no AC3 problems or self-reboots."
3,Its okay choice amoung poor ATSC/QAM choices,"Overall if you want QAM/ATSC tuner this is the best one on the market.However it has several weaknesses.1) Very slow to change channels and you have to wait for the channel to be tunned in before changing channels. This can make navigating to a sub channel very, very slow. Especially if you have 21 sub channels. No skipping multiple channels at a time2) Adding/deleting channels very, very slow3) Program guide always defaults to the channel display, not all channel displays. So looking at a real program guide takes several punches of the remote4) Remote range is short, you need to be close5) Also the tuner crashes frequently and needs to be rebooted.6) direct tunning can be very iff due to the remote issuesStrengths1) Good reception2) QAM/ATSC tuning (most boxes are ATSC only, and why?)3) Decent program guide (no auto time setting)"
4,works good one small problem,"I'm in a rural area, so eith a rooftop antenna it pulls in about 5 stations. One small design flaw. It will store antenna channels or cable channels, but not both."
1,BE CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING,"I have used this jewelry cleaner for more than 15 years. I bought the same red jar for my GOLD jewelry as I always have in the past except that they changed the packageing and on the red jar is a blue label that says for SILVER jewelry. The company has admitted it was my fault for not reading the label, and I too admit that I failed to read the blue label, but the results were devastating, my wedding and anniversary rings were tarnished so badly I have had to take them to a jeweler to have them hand buffed and polished. The charge for this is $100, not to mention an hour drive each way and three weeks without my rings. I will never buy this cleaner again!"
4,Princess shower curtain hooks,"Absolutely compliments the shower curtain purchased. Be careful because the heads break off easily. Anyway, they look great according to my kids and visitors."
4,I Love It!,"This book was given to me about a year ago, and I finally used it. I made the artist box w/ the palette on top, becuase my daughter is an artist, plus she has been asking me to do it for awhile now, so I surprised her with it at her birthday party. Everyone was impressed, I agree that some of the ingredients are hard to find, but I just called around and found everythiung. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves the art of cake decorating."
4,Can anyone post any sample pictures?,I'm looking for a closeup lens for my Canon EOS Rebel XT. But before buying I wish I can see some pictures taken using this lens.
5,Works great with Olympus E-300,"I bought the Canon 250D expecting it to be a good alternative to an expensive lens. I use it with my E-300 Olympus camera and the 40/150mm lens. It requires a little work to get a proper focus, but when you have it, the results are superlative. I recommend it highly."
2,I wanted to like this,"I was very excited to try this, and I love that it's from a small company, but it seems to make my lips drier than they were before I used it. I won't be using this anymore, but I'm glad to hear that it seems to work for some people. It smells nice, at least."
1,poorly made,I was very disappointed with this bangle. The clasp was very poor quality and the metal ring that fitted over the clasp fell off the second time I wore it. The metal ring was a piece of thin metal bent into a circle-shape. I will be sending this itemback.
4,Listen And You'll See!,"This is the second of a trilogy of LP's that the band put out for the Chisa and MoWest labels, and is the first that they released as The Crusaders. All four of the original members are present, along with guitarist Arthur K. Adams. The fifteen-minute-plus title song features Friends Of Distinction member Philemon Hou ""tapping and begging"". Next follows a remake of their 1962 classic ""The Young Rabbits"", with a killer drum solo from Stix. ""Listen And You'll See"" is a rarely heard gem. The original version of ""Greasy Spoon"" follows. ""Treat Me Like Ya Treat Yaself"" is a jab at both Sly Stone and Les McCann. ""Goin' Down South"" has a hard-driving beat. The CD closes with the gospel-flavored ""Love Can't Grow Where The Rain Won't Fall"". This recording is a must for die-hard Crusaders fans!"
1,Is this SciFi?,"If your a SciFi fan this supposedly STARGATE series isn't worth your time. Too much Soap Opera set in a Stargate like theme with little science fiction. No aliens, not futurist Tech, not even much to do with the Stargate. This series reads like it was written by a hormonal teenager and as such should be relegated to the Adult Entertainment section. It is definitly NOT suitable for kids!"
1,Is it over yet?,"I didn't even make it through the 1st season. None of the characters are likable. Everybody spends their time whining, being emotional or out of control. We are subjected to Hollywood stereotypes of a totally undisciplined military contingent, the angry black soldier who rebels against authority, the psycho white soldier who attacks anybody without provocation, the slut who has sex with all the soldiers, the Asian lesbian, the weak commander who is preoccupied with getting home to his cheating wife, the immature useless mouthy 'genius' who can't reason his way out of a wet paper bag and the weird scientist type who has his own mysterious agenda. After a couple episodes, I really could care less what happened to them."
2,Okay,"I enjoy the fact that I can download tv shows, and movies. It's relaxing when on a long ride to be able to view a tv show or movie. Didn't get into this show."
5,Great Series - Too Short,"This was a great addition to the Stargate World, but unfortunately Sci-Fi canceled it after only 2 seasons. (A very bad move in my books.) This series was just starting to find its feet and become even better when it was cut short. Luckily, the series ended with a Cliffhanger - leaving future possibility. Hopefully someone will pick it back up or at least do a follow-up movie like they did to close out SG-1. If you loved SG-1 and Atlantis you will love SGU too."
4,Enjoyed more than SG-1 or Atlantis,"Other reviewers have stated it as well. It's just a different type of show from the other Stargate shows. One that I loved, and was very sad it was cancelled."
3,One of these movies is terrible,"Blizzard was a great movie. The kids enjoyed it (especially my nine-year-old daughter). The teens didn't complain, and even my husband and I were able to sit through it. But Prancer was horribly boring and, well, dumb. Not even the nine-year old could stand it. I recommend buying Blizzard separately for less."
4,Very helpful in translating,"This book seems to have just about everything I need for grammar purposes when I translate to and from Japanese. However, I have on rare occassion been stumped, with no help from this book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to translate, but I'd advise other tools for learning the language."
2,DOESN'T PERFORM AS ADVERTISED,"The unit is louder than a PC, but not too loud. It never got to more than 24 degrees below ambient, and condensed lots of water the entire time. Alen answered the phone right away. They have emailed me an RMA number but have not offered to pay for shipping. I am still emailing them."
3,Portable Mini Fridge,"I bought this mini fridge for my husband to use in his work truck to keep drinks cold. I works ""okay"". It keeps the drinks cool and not as cold as I had hope. We put frozen ice packs in with the drinks and that seems to help keep them be a little cooler, but really not cold."
1,"Remember, it is only SF....","Someone said in the previous review ""I can't help but feel the real reason the authors wrote this story was to indulge in their hope that someday, all world religions would come to an end.""This is a very typical, predictable and sad mode of operation for Mr. Clarke. One just has to remember it is SF, meaning, that lack of God is just as a flight fancy to most as there being a God is to Mr. Clarke. When he passes he will learn, one way or the other.As for the book, yes, old idea told yet again. Writing is ok but the premise is tired."
2,Great Premise - Not So Great A Story,"If you read most other reviews for this book, you know by now what it is about: new technology that essentially abolishes privacy (current and past).The story moves by leaps and bounds. However, the characters remain flat. And the technology, while evolving through the story, does not add to the story.This book could have been a great book if the first 100 pages potential was exploited. Instead, each time the technology improved, the story lost its relevancy."
2,too bored to go on,"Second co-written book of Clarkes that fell short. I was so bored with this. Seems theres no real reason for this book other then for publicity. Everything is flat except for the over the top mathamatics. I love hardcore sci-fi but if Clarke and Baxter wanted to write a text book, then thats what they should have done. Not hide their views and ideas behind a weak and inferior story. Ill keep catching up with Clarkes past books, but this new stuff is pointless and unimaginative."
2,Claptrap,"If you enjoy environmentalist claptrap, bashing evangelists and Jesus, and a plot that takes a great premise and turns it into mud then by all means please read this book from cover to cover.I was very disappointed, to say the least. The intelligent and fascinating plot device is insufficient to save this poorly constructed story or hide the glaring SERMON of humanism. Rent 2001 instead and remember the light of Clarke's other days."
4,Typical Clarke,"I have been a fan of Clarke for over 35 years, and he has yet to flesh out a character. The ""Concept"" is the focal point. The language and sexuality was disappointing, but maybe that was Baxter who added it. Or Clarke is simply flowing with the culture. The attacks on historical figures was predictable, especially Jesus. But as the Afterword explains, sources for an alternative life of Jesus are common, i.e., the Jesus Seminar. In an uncharacteristic manner, the Epilogue destroyed the book. If the book at finished with the last chapter, it would have been appropriate, hinting at a sequal. However the theme of the Epilogue doesn't relate to the rest of the book. Since I can't reveal the ending, I will say that I had expected the Joined to become of the Matrix of Childhood's End. But the Epilogue fails because...never mind, can't do that without spoiling the disappointing ending. Up to the Epilogue, it was a very good book."
2,Tepid,"Typical Clarke novel -- long on high concept, short on characthers. Most characters are over the top caricatures -- the greedy industrialist (and a foreigner, to boot), the brilliant driven scientist having battles of faith, the innocent (dopey) second son (ok, they made him that way), the woman journalist (who's also good in the sack), the FBI guy, and the .... (don't want to give everything away).Baxter (who apparently did most of the writing) has done better."
4,Interesting ideas,"I picked this book up because of Arthur C. Clarke, and it is my first time reading Stephen Baxter. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The exploration of how society reacts when all privacy is absolutely stripped away, and when all of Earth's history - back to the first life form - is available for everyone to see with 100% accuracy, could have been explored at greater length. ""True biographies"" of famous people such as Jesus and Abraham Lincoln are obtained with the WormCam technology, and found to be significantly different from what is widely believed. I found the book somewhat predictable, but the ideas were engaging."
4,Carhartt Ripstop Work Shorts,"These are nice, fashionable shorts. They are fairly comfortable, despite the heavy material. They seem to sit a bit lower on the waist than normal and are fairly slim cut.A big improvement would be a gusseted crotch to add to the comfort factor. They also seem to run a size small. I normally wear 33's, but 34's are almost marginally small on me."
4,referee magazine,"if you are and offical at any level of sports, referee magazine is a good magazine for you. It has good tips and advice in it. I will be a life long subscriber to it"
3,"Sappy, sappy, sappy","I thought this was going to have some real substance to it. There was potential but somehow the author never got around to it. It was hard to determine what the time line was. Most of the dialogue was contrived. If it had been pared down to what was relevant to the story, this book would have been a short-story. I was two thirds through the book before the meat of the story even began and then it was so apparent how it was going to end and what the theme was, that it really didn't matter if I finished the book or not. However, I stuck it out and breathed a sigh of relief when I read the last page."
2,Not what I thought it would be.....,"I researched this toy for months before buying it and all the cartridges that go with it. Only then did I find out that it's definitely not for the ages recommended! The book does not stay attached to the unit and my little one still (after having it since last Christmas!) can't get it to work right.. It is way too sensitive for little fingers, and kind of heavy for her too. After spending all that money I really regret this one, even now at 19 months she's not interested in it, probably because she remembers how frustrating it is! Also the cartridges are too easy for little ones to pull out of the top of the unit--Wait until your little one is older before considering this toy!"
2,Not pleased,1* for fun because it's too sensitive. You don't have to touch the item for it to go off. Before my finger is placed on an object the unit senses my wrist or arm and so it senses an object that you're not pointing at.The books do not lock in place thus my daughter only wants to pull the books out of the unit. We have three books and I've used this unit twice in three months.3* for durability if you don't abuse it and it seems like the pages in the book could bend and stay that way so I give it a 3*3* for educational value because this would be a good learning tool for a kid who is about 4 years old and has better control of their hands and is actually interested in reading rather than taking the book in and out for enjoyment. I don't feel this is good for a toddler.
3,Nice looking but...,"This kennel is very nice looking and provides a lot of ventalation but lacks quality workmanship and materials. The clips that hold the top and bottom together would not stay latched. I also would not carry this kennel by the handle if there was an animal inside no matter how much they weighed. I just wouldn't trust the cheap latches to stay closed.In addition, the Amazon web site description states this kennel would fit an animal up to 15 inches tall by 23 inches long but the manufactures tag on the kennel itself stated it would only fit an animal up to 12 inches tall and 21 inches long. Now, I don't know where they get those guidelines from but my dog, who is 15 inches tall, seemed to have plenty of room and if it had not been for the problem with the latches I would have definately kept this purchace."
3,"Does the job, but damn ugly","If you're looking for a cheap crate that does the job of keeping your small pet safe, this will do. It's easy to assemble (albeit, a bit janky), very lightweight and sturdy enough for a small animal. But damn, it is ugly! I thought I was getting a linen-colored top and a gray bottom (which is what was pictured), but I got poop-colored top and navy blue bottom. I needed it this weekend, which is why I kept it, but otherwise I would've returned it for a different color. The whole thing is really cheaply made and the latches that hold the two halves together don't fit all that well. The door takes a bit of finagling to get the bars into place. All in all, I guess you get what you pay for. My dog is 10 lbs and we can carry her around without a problem."
1,Poor quality and unsafe,"Very light weight and the fastening system is not safe unless you use nylon ties to hold the two halves together. The door can pop out very easily if an animal struggles or is panicked. Despite the kennels small size a dog of 50 pounds can get in there so it will not hold together with that much weight or that strong an animal. Petmate has obviously let the marketing people take over and are ""milking"" the brand name. I have 6 of their kennels and the older ones were much stronger and better made. Look for a better kennel/carrier!!"
4,Kennel Cab,"This was actually a little smaller than I anticipated but it still holds my overweight sussex spaniel (she probably weighs 35 pounds and stands about 15 inches), but there is no way I could carry her in it. It would fall apart. I put the carrier in the back of my SUV and she jumps in it herself. There is just enough room for her to get turned around and lay down."
5,Ideal for small-to-medium dog.,"After looking at similar containers from WalMart I decided on this one. It was cheaper and it had a handle. While the smaller one should have been fine for my dog (a miniature schnauzer) I decided on the next size as a precaution. One piece of advice: I had trouble closing the plastic latches on either side of the door. I finally used a hammer to close them (if they are not closed, the door will pop out). If you are going to disassemble the carrier for traveling purposes, take a hammer with you. Also, if you have a large dog or one that is especially heavy the carrier may be more flimsy if the gauge of plastic is the same for all the carriers."
2,Flimsy for a large crate,Presumably a large crate is for a larger pet so should be able to carry more weight... not this crate! We have two cats -- one 10 lbs and one 8 lbs -- and like to travel with them in one crate (less stressful for them). We had to carry the crate from the bottom because the handle was about ready to pop through the top when we tried to carry by the handle. It is a good size though.
2,"""basic""","I wanted some basic yoga moves, stretches, and exercises that were simple, and not impossible. But I was actually unable to do most of the video. I think it is a good guide for more experienced people, but not for me."
3,New look at an old story......,"I own every version of Dicken's Christmas Carol that I can find, and they all have their good points. In ""Chasing Christmas"" the ""scrooge"" character is about as unlikeable as any I've seen, because this one is the dad of a beautiful teenage girl who longs for a normal Christmas. Her dad, who is embittered about Christmas because he caught his wife cheating on him on a Christmas Eve 7 years ago, hates everything about Christmas. Of course there are the usual Ghosts of Christmas, but in a unique twist, the Ghost of Christmas Past is also embittered at the world he sees now, and wishes to live in the past himself. Scrooge and Christmas Present embark on a funny and touching race to find ""Past"" before midnight, when everyone will be stuck in the past forever.Not the greatest version of the classic, but a fun and likeable one."
3,crucified girl,"after being linked to her website via an email group for eating disorders, i thought i would give it a shot. her life struggles were clearly outlined in many of her songs, but often off track. it seems as though as she is holding back because her voice is strong lyrically but weak vocally. the music tends to dominate her voice, which bothers me when such intense subjects are being addressed. songs like 'divorce song' and 'bitter blue' want me to curl up and cry when i read the lyrics but when i listen to it, it does nothing. the cover of the cd is powerful, depending a child tied to a cross, which right there would turn me away. i will give her another chance though, mostly because musically it is well put together, but her voice needs to be stronger and her lyrics more mature as the message gets drowned as the cd goes on."
4,Moeller 6 gallon boat fuel tank,"Like others, I've found this to be a good above-deck tank. It is exact duplicate of an older Moeller tank I own and its contours are an exact match to the inner hull of the 16 ft. Amesbury Dory that was built for me by Stur-Dee Boat Co. I have not experienced the problems with leaks at the seams that at least one other person reported. However, the tank is not without its problems. The fuel gauge seems permanently stuck at the 1/2 full mark, a problem that a Moeller representative indicated may be due to some excess plastic ""flashing"" on a gauge component. (I was urged to remove the gauge from tank and file down any excess flashing with an emory board.) There was no documentation with this tank indicating that meets the new EPA zero emissions policy. The Moeller representative I spoke with confirmed that this tank is legal for engines built in 2011 or earlier. However, because of the filler cap it is not legal for use with 2012 (and newer) engines."
1,$100 buck just wasted...,"The spring-door mechanism doesn't line up with the holes in the plastic, making closing the doors a pain. There's a place for a handle to go, which would make carrying this around a whole lot easier (this thing is BIG)... but there's no handle, leaving you only one option: drag it around (it's too big and awkward to carry). Finally, the plush bed that Amazon linked with this item when I bought it doesn't fit... ( Midwest 40236 36-By-23-Inch Quiet Time Bolster Pet Bed, Fleece)...it's too large. Bad purchase all the way around."
3,Mixed review...,"I like the color, the door latch is easy to use, and it's big enough to transport 2 medium cats. However, the plastic bolts/nuts that hold it together are awful - very easy to strip out. They give you a bag of about 10 times as many as you need, so you have a stockpile. Plan to replace them with the real thing. I expected better quality for the price."
4,Excellent choice,"An excellent crate for the money: sturdy, easy to assemble, safe, attractive and easy to clean. It is perfect for our intended use.This is not a good choice for someone who wants to break down the crate for car travel. Buyer should also be aware that door opens in only one direction (hinge to left as viewed)."
4,"Well constructed, good product","The dog likes it, so that is a plus right away. Easy to assemble, secure door, good size. The Large seems like it will be a good size- big for a Golden pup but should be fine for an adult female. Only minor issue is I wish this size had a handle on top. Smaller ones seem to have a handle, but the lack of a handle on the large makes it a bit akward to move. Overall a very nice kennel."
4,Vari Kennel,"I have multiple show dogs and have purchased assorted brands of crates through the years. I always return to the Petmate Vari Kennel due to the quality for the price. I gave this 4 stars rather than 5, because I did notice this crate seems to be a little bit lighter built than my other Vari Kennel crates. As long as the price remains reasonable, I don't mind it being a ""little bit"" lighter built - but I hope they don't continue to reduce the durability of this crate."
3,A good overview of the Vietnam Conflict.,This book is a good balanced account of the history of the Vietnamese Conflict. A nice compilation.
4,once twice three times overlooked,"we all heard the ballads like forever cause the ballads lionel richie performed will never die, brick house tired of that i like this because of the way forgotten funk the commodores made before lionel started shopping at hallmark, like are you happy a classic, cebu that is the bomb, why is that never mentioned? if you wanna hear the ballads then this is fopr you, but if you wanna hear a different side of the commodores then check it out, you might be like is this lionel."
4,Very Happy With This,"I know, I know. How can a person buy something like this on-line? I recognize that the ""look and feel"" of a portfolio can't be adequately assessed unless you actually look at and feel it.Anyway, I took the chance and did the old ""1-click"" trigger finger action hoping for the best.I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. The leather cover is nice and feels good to the touch. It appears to be reasonably rugged. I'm not ashamed to carry it to the downtown office tower where I work (which is full of well heeled snobby lawyer types).Rating:Met my expectations. It is not fine Italian leather from Florence. But given this economy, it is definitely a good value."
3,Well written but structurally flawed,"Interesting characters and great prose, but there is a serious structural problem here. After 30-odd years of life, the two main characters meet their birth mothers and everything -- all their emotional issues, character traits, effect on their own families -- is neatly resolved and wrapped up in six months or so? Not credible, and this effort to wrap everything up so fast and tidily makes the novel seem to rush by in a blur to an artificially contrived ending. Had the author written a longer book which showed the unfolding events and character developmnet over several years, it would have been a great book..."
3,Buy with Caution,"I bought this CD blind, thinking it was by Soma, of Dave Thrussel and Pieter Bourke fame (Inner Cinema, Hollow Earth), but it was not. What I ended up with was a CD with hip-hop music on it. Now, that may be what you are looking for, and if so, great, but I wasn't, and am not sure how the two bands with similar names and tracks got confused, but they did. So, if you're looking for something to add to your Bourke/Thrussel collection, this may not be it, and I'd advise you not buy this blind, like I did."
5,After Having My Rolex Stolen.........,"...........I purchased this watch and I simply love it. The gold-plate is bright on the band, and the face (when one looks carefully) is an under-stated version of the Burberry classic plaid. Practical yet elegant, it is fitting for work or special occasions. I rarely give 5 stars to anything, but four stars seemed too few. The one piece of advice that I will give is to make certain that the band is well fitted. I suspect it might be uncomfortable to wear otherwise. (Mera, Kevin's Significant Other)"
4,"Basic info for a fresh, clean look","Reasonably priced DVD that tells how to create a classic, clean make-up look. It is also 70 minutes long. If you are a novice to make-up application, this DVD is for you. Also for those who just want to see someone else's version of a basic face. There are also some practical tips and tricks that will make you say to yourself ""wow, why didn't I think of that!"" I enjoyed it."
5,the best dog every,This game is a very good game. It kept my 4 year old busy and he loved to play it...Clifford is one of his favorite cartoon characters. I recomend this game to everyone
2,False Advertising!!!,"Pros: Well made, good padding, heavy material, and should last well beyond the time I have use for it.Cons: I bought this bag because it was advertised (see the listing) as ""7 x 14 x 7 inches"". As soon as I opened the box, I was suspicious of the size. It didn't look much wider than my previous bag (11 inches). Upon measuring (as removed from the box), it was 11 inches. When laid next to a ruler and stretched as far as possible by pulling on the side pockets, it was barely 13 inches! There is no way anyone could measure this bag and come up with 14 inches wide!Since my cameras & accessories do just fit in the bag, I decided to keep it. Anyone considering this bag should be aware - Amazon apparently does not verify manufacturers' claims!!!"
3,this is a Magazine not a book,He was a little disapointed with the item. He thought it was a book not a magazine
4,Great Album,"I gave this album a 4 because it just has to be perfect for me to give it a 5. I have never seen Nashville Star, so when I bought this I did not know he was on it. I just bought the album because I am overseas and there is not very many country cd's over here. I am really only a fan of Texas Country music, so when I purchased this album I wasn't really expecting much since I've never heard of him. I was very surprised though when I started listening. He has a very good sound more to the tune of traditional country. I would definitely recommend this album to buy. I think we will be seeing more of this guy in the future."
5,very good,"very pretty elegant very sport clock., the very good mesh, the alarms and demas everything to perfeccion.. and was to a very very good price. if they did not ubiesen it raised... it ubiese bought 3 but for the family. it hurts that they raised it as much. but very recommendable. and excellent quality..."
4,This book really helped.,"When I suddenly experienced intense pain and swelling, leading to the discovery that I had developed RA, I felt totally blindsided. I knew nothing about this disease and needed info that I could understand right away. This book was a huge help to me and I still find reasons to go back to it again and again."
3,Review of Kershaw Tactical Folding Knife,"The knife is very nice. The blade, case, colored aluminum handle. It's a great knife. There is one item that I am extremely disappointed about and that is it's size. This knife is tiny, only good for opening a box or cutting some thin chord.But it is my fault, because I misread the description about the knifes dimensions. I thought 3 1/2"" was the blades length, and this was ths closed overall length. So I spent $45 for a very small pocket knife. Next time I will read the description much more carefully. The quality is there, just was to small."
5,Best Knife Ever!,Shipped quickly! this is the most beautiful knife I have ever purchased and it is the most functionally sound one as well. Thank you Ken Onion for designing such a wonderful knife!
3,Adam and Eve,This is a great classic. I saw:A different Adam and Eve story.Stepping out of paradise is growing up.And More.
5,Relax and enjoy a leisurely walk through present and past.,"Mrs. Waverly lets you walk not only through her relaxing back yard full of wonderful plants and landscaping ideas, but she also transports you back in time to the wonderful gardens of her past. If you appreciate the fact that nature transcends time, you'll love this book!"
4,Almost everything I wanted,"I have had this unit for about 3 months without any electrical problems. The reason I got this unit was to make backups of all of my old VHS tapes on to DVD, but it doen't let you copy any copyrighted material. I still can copy all of my personal recordings to DVD, which is nice, because now I can throw out all of those VHS tapes.I would say the nicest feature is the upconvert to HD. This is great because I fed my satellite dish receiver through it and it upconverts everything I watch.I still can't figure out how to reset the counter on the VCR, except for pulling the tape out and then putting it back in.I also wish the manual was a little more clear when it comes to multiple session recordings to a DVD.The list of DVD/VCR combos that upconvert and record to dual layer DVD's is very limited so I'm glad I found one that fits most of my needs.All in all I'm pretty happy with this DVD/VCR."
1,"Good while it lasted, eats tapes now",The title says it all. Worked fine with very light tape usage until Apr. 1012. Now eats most my tapes. Not good as I am trying to archive them on DVD. Eats tape on eject. Excess loop is snagged but usually can be manipulated to remove without breaking tape. Then I can open trap door in tape and spool back. Not good but might work in another player. Or the tape can be spliced if you are up to a tricky job.
4,I Love Watching Bobby Sing & Swing!,"For those of us who try to sing & move like Bobby, this CD is ""must viewing."" For those who want to remember how good a performer he was and pull the CD out with a smile on your face, this will do it. I am 60 years old and I still try to sing like Bobby. I do it more for exercise now than anything else. I have been a Bobby Darin fan since I was 12, because no one swings like he did. Never have, never will. He sang, danced, played at least a half-dozen instruments, did impressions, and could act. As far as this CD goes my only complaint (beside it's being too short) is that the funny bit at the end of ""Beyond the Sea"" was not added. It was funny. Long, but funny. As for every thing else on the CD, it was fun to watch and listen to. Frank Sinatra said it best: ""Bobby just did it all."""
3,just a little too sweet...,"I started my low fat, low salt, (low everything good) diet after a heart attack. I had high hopes for finding ""replacements"" but they don't really exist. This peanut spread is fine, but you need to realize it's not the same as ""real"" and deal with it. It seems that sugar is the replacement of choice for many low salt products. This product tastes like it already contains the jam or jelly for your kids' peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Give it a try - I found it at Trader Joe's."
1,Not a guide to planning your wedding in Seattle.,"I assumed this book would be a guide to planning a wedding in Seattle, WA. Thus the title ""Seattle Bride Wedding Planner"". There is a 5 page resource section at the back which does list some shops in the Seattle area, but this is nothing that you couldn't get on your own from the internet. The majority of the book is a preformatted wedding planner full of various forms for those brides who plan to have an expensive and traditional wedding complete with bridal consultant. It was in no way useful to me. This book could easily be marketed as ""Kansas City Bride"" if they changed the resource section. If you are trying to plan a wedding in Seattle...keep trying. This book is a waste of your time."
2,A lesson in poor decision making!,"First off . . . what's with all the power lines? Are we to believe that it's the electricity in the air that's frying these people's brains and not allowing them to think clearly? Secondly, nobody is likable. There's no joy in anyone's life. Just a bunch of dis-functional morons trying to cover up all their poor choices and not doing a very good job of it either. Doesn't anyone work, do their homework, cook a meal? All their characters are so preoccupied with the macabre that their is no time to live a life with even a morsel of dignity. The special features mentioned something about what a breakthrough it was to see violence against women from a woman's perspective. What trash! This is the perspective of a pervert serial killer catering to a damaged mind's most deviant desires. Didn't like it . . . can't recommend it . . . thought it was a waste of time and money!"
5,Sweeeeet!,I convinced my sister to buy me this book for my birthday 4 months early so I could make her the fish purse for her birthday which was way before mine. Since then I've made 3 of the fish purses. They rock. Whenever we are carrying one people stop us to ask about it. My sister even had japanese tourists taking pictures of it (not her) in an airport. All of the projects are super cool and would probably get the same reaction. Now I just need to brush up on my fair isle skills so I can try knitting the Doll Bag.
3,Not my cup of tea,"if you enjoy listening to someome twanging aimlessly on a guitar, you will probably like this. If you like classical guitar concerti, your reaction to it will probably be ""Meh."" That said, it is quite relaxing and might grow on me if I listen to it a few more times."
2,"Disappointing, barely sexy","It fascinates me how people can write so many words about sex and not be sexy. A couple of the essays are decent, but the fiction is incredibly shallow and non-erotic, just like on their site. The phony virgin story has to be the worst. _Much_ better erotic writing is being put up on the Web every month by places like scarlettletters.com and cleansheets.com . I can only say that I'm glad a friend gave me his copy of this book and I didn't buy it!"
4,sounds great!!,"This sony boombox is everything I wanted in a portable radio right now. Everything works, sounds and looks good. The size is smaller than I thought it would be and thats a good thing. I could not give it a 5 star rating because the display window in the front that tells you what track number you are on or what radio station number is too small. More important, is the fact that this display window is not back lit. It is almost impossible to see without the back lighting. I literally have a little LED flashlight nearby that I use in order to see display information. Aside from that, for the price, it is a great boombox. I would recommend to a friend."
4,Quality item,"This radio has excellent sound quality. I think it is too ""loud"" to look at, but I couldn't find one that looked like an adult would own it. I needed it for my back yard and it serves its purpose. I like the size and weight of it, it feels substantial and it delivers powerful sound."
5,Everyone should read this book,"One of the funniest, interesting and most relaxing books I have ever read. Tom Hodgkinson disects societies obsession with work and shows us all why we should really take more interest in enjoying life. He shows how ridiculous it is to feel guilty about relaxing , i.e being idle and in the process demonstrating how it leads to contemplation and creativity. A great book which gives you a zest for living."
5,It's ok to be human,"I read this book while in a summer vacation and it was the perfect companion. While it's a witty and funny quick read, it also had a more deep, and longlasting effect on me. It's good to remind ourselves, in this efficiency driven (and sicken) society we live in, that it didn't use to be this way always, and more important it doesnt have to be like this. It has a philosophical side which I've found to be good food for thought, without being dense."
1,Hannah,"did not buy this, you have this on the wrong buyers page, check back and you'll see I didn't buy this, hope I wasn'r charged!"
3,The Heart of Nursing,"This sensitive collection of real-life stories represents a fascinating and realistic cross-section of what nurses really do. The sacred relationship between patient and nurse is unique and indescribable. Nurses are a special breed, and this anthology proves it. Although this is a great read, the sometimes unclear and slightly awkward wording gets in the way of feeling the full emotional impact of the stories. As a nurse of thirty years, I too have learned volumes from countless incredibly brave patients. Some of these stories prompted me to go back to my own experiences. Ms. Schneider has revealed to us the heart of nursing. As I embark on the process of getting my own book published, I hope to touch the hearts of nurses, patients and caregivers."
3,Disappointment from a great theologian,"I have benefited greatly from many of R. C. Sproul's books and radio broadcasts, but I was disappointed in this book. If it had an accurate title and promotional material, it would have helped. Most of the book is not about the last days according to Jesus. It is the last days according to Paul, John, J. Stuart Russell, John Calvin, Kenneth L. Gentry Jr., Max R. King, and many others. Dr. Sproul presents the views of others, often with long quotes, and occasionally comments on errors that they made, but he rarely presents his own beliefs and conclusions about the end times. He seems to be, tentatively, a partial preterist, but does not say so with the deep conviction that he is known for. This book was only a little help in helping me to choose between the many competing views of the last days."
4,Last days according to Jesus r c sprouls,"Interesting to see a staunch reformed theology scholar take a fresh unbiased look at eschatology.dr sprouls comes to the logical conclusion that Jesus olivet discourse was meant to be fulfilled in the 1st century.although he stops short of full preterism,he may be a catalyst in getting other mainline pastors to consider the importance of 1st century fulfillment ."
1,Doesn't last...,"I used this laminator just a few times and the rollers stopped feeding the pages through. In theory it has great features, but if you can't use them they're pointless."
1,no deal,I too thought I was getting a great deal because the picture shows it as a 10 pack! It is NOT! I took a second look bc it said 1 pack-then I figured it was 1 pack fo 10. bummer! So I got saddled with a bunch of shipping costs on top.
4,I'd like to re-review this and improve the rating.,"Well, after dedicating a solid month, I can say I finally have figured it out. This is a great book with only some typos. The beginning is far too basic even for a pre-teen, but if you dont know this info, you shouldnt continue in the book.I'm happy to say I can write simple programs now, and even made one for next April Fools!"
3,Sams teach yourself beginning programming in 24 hours,"This book was a pretty decent Book for people who know how to write programs,but if you are not familiar with programming this book is not for you. That's why have rated it a 3 star."
5,Great overall source for all your Civ Pro needs,"I was ""forced"" to purchase this book (in addition to a casebook) for my law school civ pro class. I avoided the ""red book"" as much as possible and sold it at the end of the year. However, I soon came to realize that the book contains a great wealth of info from basic stuff to very cutting edge theory. Although my first year I struggled through the material in my civ pro course, I could have done much better had I utilized this book! Now, I have repurchased this book and rely on it immensly. This book is teaching and reteaching me the civ pro course.It is not for the extreme beginner (i.e. it is not a replacement for an emmanuel), but Civil Procedure is a very academic and intellectual source worth the 40-something bucks."
4,Another oldie but goodie!,Good clean family show of the 50's. Like to watch stuff like this rather than violence and crime. Recommended for everyone.
5,"Best yet, Want more",It seems odd that such an old show would take so long to produce DVD's for sale. I want all seasons and I would like them now!This season was the most enjoyable to date and I love to watch them and recall how much of life was for a lot of us in middle America.Buy this and you will only be disappointed that season 4 is not yet released.
1,In the Trash,This was in the trash within an hour after receiving. For some unknown and totally unnecessary reason the battery compartment which has a quick release on the back is also screwed shut with a soft metal screw. I own a small glass-repair screwdriver which fit the screw head perfectly but one turn of the screwdriver and the cheap metal screw head was stripped. Tried one more time and that did it. No way was this screw coming out. This is a warning - don't waste your money.
1,poor product,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. The led lights are mounted on a internal circuit board that swivels along with the lights. I used this product one week, only to find that the light would not come on. I suspect a short between the circuit board and the wires leading to it. I spent too much money on this piece of junk. I do not know where it was made, but probably where everything else is, nowdays. I threw it in the trash where it belongs."
5,Best Reading Light!!!,"I decided to get this reading light based on customer reviews- I am so glad that I did!!! I struggle to see well when there is not sufficient light and this ""necklace"" has cured my problem. I love that it dosen't have to attach to the book, and hangs safely on my neck. I use it with both books and my kindle. Do not hesitate to buy this product, you will not be dissapointed."
2,it came highly rated but...,The content of this book is decent although it would benefit from a good deal of fleshing out-it is difficult to cover any complexity in the space of a small pamphlet and with large print to boot.You can read it in a half hour.Needless to say I was quite disappointed and felt I was ripped off for what I paid.It would make a good tract to hand out free on the street
3,Bearings gave out,I bought one of these and used it for a month or two on my hand truck before it started spitting bearings out of the hub. I question the 300 lb. load capacity because the bearings didn't last under anywhere near that weight for me. But as long as your not loading them too much I'd say they are a nice tire.
3,Flat free hand truck tire,A little overpriced but i was done pumping up my tires every time i needed to use my hand truck.
5,Absolutely love Chris Potter. Can't to get season 7 & 8.,"Because Chris Potter is such a great actor, and this show really shows his talent. The download was great! I am still enjoying them."
4,Buddhism 101,"This is a simple, easy-to-read book that I would highly reccommend to anyone interested in learning the basics of Buddhism. This is a great place to start if you are interested in learning about what the Buddha taught, but want it all in plain, straightforward English."
4,I love it,I love when the boyfriend tries in so many ways to use the different ways to use the boys to use dean to make the money but just strings along Jerry to keep him satisfied
4,"Better than the old SwissTech tool, but the flashlight is cheap","The old model (Micro-Tech or Micro-Plus) has really crummy rivets which can loosen over time, and sometimes are not properly set when new. This newer model (Micro-Pro) has torx screws holding the handles in place.The rounded handles are also an improvement over the old square version.Some of the edges feel a little sharp. I used some sand paper to fix it.The flashlight is not very good. It's not as bright as a Photon II, and takes up more space. It also has a slight blue tint. The switch is OK, but pressing it for the momentary function is not finger-friendly.The price of a Photon II plus a stand-alone SwissTech tool is not much more than this bundle, but maybe this improved tool has a higher cost than the models sold without flashlights. If you want cool keychain accessories, buy a Photon flashlight and toss the one bundled with your SwissTech. You can attach the tool directly to a key ring."
1,awful,"I found this book to be pretty much awful.I am a navy wife of over a year, just went through my second deployment.I cant imagine dodging my husband's phone calls from foreign ports.She portrays a whiney, selfish wife. its extremely annoying. If you want to read a less annoying more informative book try reading ""Homefront Club"" By Jacey Eckhart"
3,not an entirely bad book,"In my humble opinion this book was written for those of us who have been through deployments and the complete rollercoaster of emotions and events that are common in military life. It shows a person like me that it is ok and NORMAL to feel these feelings, although some of the actions taken in the book may not have been appropriate. It is hard, in the beginning to think about others when you are completely overwhelmed with trying to get use to things in constant turmoil yourself. And this book tells me that it is a normal thing. Ironically, the book helped me to get past the ""poor me"" outlook and think about others and make myself available to help others instead of only worrying about myself and my problems."
5,Great way to spend the day,"I really enjoyed this book!! It's funny and light hearted but makes you appreciate what our military families go through. My family isn't military, so we thank you for your families sacrfice.Elizabeth"
2,I'd be so embarrased...,"I was so excited to read this book, especially after meeting Sarah Smiley when she was a guest speaker at a military spouses group I was a part of. However, after reading the book, I was disappointed. While I admire her honesty (although I wonder how much of that ""honesty"" is driven by the need to spice up the book to improve with sales""), I would be so embarrased if I were Sarah. I am a military brat AND a military wife and have dealt with my own deployments. My husband deployed when our son was just 5 weeks old and our daughter was 2 1/2. I DID NOT FALL APART!! Nowhere near!! It's difficult, yes but there's no honor in the way she behaved! I'm teetering between sympathy for Sarah and disgrace. What a mess! I really expected more from the book though! I'm glad I didn't spend much on it!"
1,"Omg, I wish I could get my money back.","I hated this book, the whole time I was reading it I wanted to slap this lady and ask her what her problem was, she was pathetic and needy and I would like to think military wives are stronger then that. the only reason I continued to read it was because I was hoping that she would become less dumb."
5,Works as intended,High quality sandpaper made in Japan with a very durable flexible backing.Works as intended
1,You get less than what you pay for,"As the saying goes,""You Get What You Pay For"" still holds true for this bag. It has a Velcro latch to hold the top flap shut. If you try picking it up with the handle, the Velcro will not hold and the top will come open, potentially dropping your photo equipment.I bought this as a carry bag for quick photo shoots, rather than having to carry my regular camera bag with all my lenses, filters, etc.Guess I'll Stick with my regular camera bag."
1,all of the 5 star reviews were contrived,"How can there possibly be such a disparity between readers of this book? People give it 5 stars or 1 star. That's strange isn't it? Yeah, it's because some of the profiles that give this book five stars are fictitious profiles. This book is trash, and everybody who's read it knows."
2,Get Dull Really Fast,"I purchased this knife back in April of 2010, it got dull rather quickly after a few usage. Compare 420HC Stainless Steel blade to (Leek model) 440A stainless steel blade, I guess there's a bit difference here.Go with Leek model, just a few bucks more, but never wrong there."
1,Beware! Horrible for Kindle,"Decent book but impossible to read on the kindle and seeing that all the tables and examples are 'pictures"" they cannot be enlarged thus cannot be read. End up seeing about half the book at best and guessing on the rest.DO NOT BUY ON KINDLE!"
2,far from good!,"On the positive side, the book is comprehensive. However, the depth is lacking, and formatting and structure are quite terrible. In terms of formatting, sections literally run on each other without any white space in between; it's very claustrophobic! Important topics and subheading are not separated. You'll waste plenty of time just figuring out how to work with the book... How the chapters are structured is also less than logical. Examples are numerous which is good, but that means coverage of grammar is shallow for the short book as such."
4,A useful reference book on IC Cards,"This is probably the most up-to-date reference book on IC Cards. Its clear structure allows you to read your area of interest. One frustrating point : I got the software demo disk, but could never get it to work on Win3.1 or Win'95!"
4,For those who want to see kids treated and brought up well,"There is so much in such a little book! It was very easy to read and started with the importance of providing a healthy physical, emotional, and spiritual environment for a child even before conception. I loved the fact that Sr. Magdalen recognizes the spirituality of a human being even before birth! She covers childhood issues all the way through adolescence. Parenthood is seen as a God-given responsibility of the utmost importance. The focus is not on how to control your child, but rather how to provide him with a good foundation so that even if he does stray for a time, he can find the way back. Living what we teach is the best way to get the message through. This book is not too deep for the average reader and would make a wonderful gift for parents, godparents or grandparents-to-be."
2,Kindle Edition - Terrible Formatting,"This review mainly concerns the formatting for those of you thinking of purchasing the kindle edition. In a nutshell, it's godawful. Indentation combined with huge spaces between each and every paragraph result in a choppy, unpleasant reading experience, which pretty much destroyed any enjoyment of the book for me. This looked like it had been formatted for the web by a 7th grader, rather than a professional company seeking to sell a well known author through Amazon, and it does the author a disservice.I would say, for this book, by a paper copy, or take the time to find an ereader that can strip out ugly extra spaces."
4,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"Contrary to what is said in Amazon's product description, this is not one of Patricia C. Wrede's best. It's quirky, but not quite as quirky as I was hoping for. It's funny, but not quite as funny as I was hoping for. It's daring, but not quite as daring as I was hoping for. You get the point.That said, this book has *7* main characters (that's right, SEVEN), and they are all well-developed with very different personalities. The plot is well-developed and intriguing and leaves the reader guessing right up to the very end.It really is a great book, and I have trouble pinpointing WHAT exactly it is that I have to complain about; it was exciting and adventurous and not quite what I wanted it to be.Still, though, a book worth reading!Who Should Read It? Anyone interested in reading a cute, quirky fantasy with bad guys and big evil monsters"
2,Fairly superficial coverage of Nero,"I have to admit I'm disappointed in this title. I was hoping to get acquainted with the more complex capabilities of this software, but the book doesn't go any further than the free download help files from Nero.The Nero Vision (DVD video burning) material amounts to a little over a dozen pages, with most of the space taken up with screen shots - not really that useful, or, at least, not worth laying out the money for a book. Even the part of ""trimming"" a video file was wrong based on what I found by trial and error using the real product.If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and pass on this title."
2,"Stiff leather, does not wear well","The shoe is very stiff, especially the leather. After a few wears, the leather did not look good. There are spider cracks all of it. They were donated pretty quickly. I would not recommend them."
5,The Best from Bollywood,"COMPANY is one of the best movies to emerge out of Bollywood. Where most Bollywood films are 3 hour song and dance, love spectacles. COMPANY is a gritty tale of the Bombay underworld, loosly based on the gangster Daewood Ibrahim and his right hand man Chota Rajan. The film is expertly directed by Ram Gopal Varma who imbues the film with a beautiful dark gritty look.If you love the hong kong gangster films of Johnny To and John Woo you'll love this. This is a film not to be missed by any lover of genre or world cinema.This is one purchase you won't regret."
5,Who wants real anyway ?,"C'mon people, this is a video game not an exercise in physics. This game is the first racing game I've enjoyed. After buying Crazy Taxi and playing it an hour I put it away and plugged Speed Devils back in. With the choice of automatic or shift and a wide variety of cars that are all modifiable (with cash winnings of course) and several varying conditions and courses, I'm impressed. Those who seek realisam on a video game, well let me say I get enough of that on the freeway going to work."
4,Best racer on Dreamcast.,"The graphics are stunning. Not only do you get to drive in places like Aspen, Hollywood, Vegas & Louisiana, but you get to drive them at different times of day & in different weather conditions. You get to drive Lousiana in the middle of a tornado that rivals the ones seen in ""Twister"". You get to drive cool cars w/ styles ranging from the 50's to the 90's... And the cars handle like real cars. Let's not for get that in real cars you have a steering wheel. This game takes into account that you are steering w/ a thumb joystick & the steering is TIGHT. So much so that it's easy to get so into this game that you feel like you are really driving in it. BUY THIS GAME. Especially now that's it's only $15."
5,Lookin for more..............,Tom Kell is a great song writer. His music relates to all of us and we'd love to hear more. Definately a CD for cruisen up the coast. It sounds better and better all the time. It's a family favorite.
4,"Simpler than checkers, but with amazing depth.","This game is a must have for anyone who likes classic strategy games like reversi, checkers, and even chess. Turn based gameplay creates a clear set of strategies for opening, midgame, and endgame phases. The AI seems quite good too with the lower levels playable for newbies, and the higher levels challenging. This game rarely leaves my Gameboy."
5,Warm!,"This top makes all the difference in the cold. It is comfortable, and adds a surprising amount of warmth underneath my thermal top."
3,Arrived on time,Bag is small and compact. Have not used item and will have to wait to see if I can repack in packeage
4,Excellent product for the price. Great up close-- surprisingly good at far away too.,"I bought my wife this item because she wanted to be able to view butterflies and small animals ""up close"" with clarity. And it works fine for that. The pleasant surprise is how well it works for distance viewing also. It has become her favorite set (and we have several binocs, some of which are much pricier).Someone mentioned that the focus is 'fiddly.' I'm not sure what they mean but it is true that you have to change focus a lot at different distances-- the ""depth of focus"" is thinner than some binocs I've seen, but you can find your object and get it nice and sharp.We have been recommending these to anyone who asks."
5,"An unpretentious portrayal of the west, it's land and people","Ian Tyson is an old hand with an ever-fresh eye for painting in song the lifestyles and land of the west he loves and bemoans because of its too-rapid disappearance. His catchy melodies rope you in like the cattle he brands. His unique perspective colors your minds eye like the rainbows arcing over the range. His deep melodic voice both thunders and whispers into your heart and mind like the chinook winds and the gentle prairie breezes that presage the night. The breadth of his musical style, like the sparkling midnight skies, holds you and surprises you, tantalizes you and entertains you. The skies, the land and people tumble from his heart. His love for this land and lifestyle are brilliantly captured for your enjoyment. Sit down in front of your fireplace and be entertained by a master!"
2,Maybe for the new,"Great graphics, but I draw the line there. Ridiculously repetitive gameplay that never goes anywhere, not to mention a drab storyline. Beautiful characters, ruined by their inane comments. I wouldn't recommend it, but you can rent it if you're not sure."
4,"NEXT TO BEAU GESTE, THIS BOOK MAY BE BEST!!","Try reading ""Beau Geste"" (fiction) first before attemptingthis book (nonfiction). The origins and history of thislegendary corps of mercenaries fighting for the French ispresented in a well-researched and quite readable manner.For those who think the Legion was only employed in NorthAfrica, this book will be an eye-opener. The book is highlydetailed and may weary the casual reader, but if you trulyhave an interest in la legionne etrangere, you won't bebored. The narrative keeps moving nicely for the most part,and well depicts the everyday life of the legionnaire aswell as their glories and defeats in battle. A good historyof an elite, yet thoroughly human, fighting force."
5,Rayman 2,"This is the most auesome game on N64. The graphics are great and the game is great. It isn't too hard, but it is not easy either. It has one fault the camera angles are horrible"
3,A fun story a fun challenge and a fun new character!,"To start out, Rayman is this unique character, who has cool powers which he gains along his adventure to save his frog friend Globbox who is being held captive by pirates. It is a Mario type game with tougher bad guys and Rayman can throw balls of light at everyone. This game takes you to a whole new 3D world with a few dozens of levels, each huge and challenging. The challenges are full of puzzles, traps and monsters. It is a good game to improve problem-solving abilities. Despite the challenge they are all fun challenges that differ from level to level. Such as one level, you must fly through a tremendous lava tube, another you must ride a rocket through a twisting and turning pirate ship. Fun for younger ages and it will take about six months to beat. You may want to rent it before you buy it, but when you rent it you will be hooked."
2,Don't Bother,"Rayman 2 is not by any means worth buying (new or used.) Boring is a word that would best describe this game. The one bright spot could be the graphics, but that alone does not make this a fun game. If you are looking for an adventure game as such I would recomend Banjo-Kazooi, Donkey Kong 64, or Zelda 64. These are real games that are about 50 times more enjoyable than Rayman. Take my advice and don't spend your money."
2,They did terrible,"When it first came out i thought it looked cool so i got it.i found it very fun in the first couple levels, but when i got to the point were i fought the monster guy, it got very hard.since then i got to the second place were you fight for the second mask... ...I got to that level almost a year ago.unless you want a hard game, DO NOT GET RAYMAN 2!it's the worst game i ever saw."
3,African Dwarf Frogs Kind of Like It,"My African Dwarf Frogs will eat it on occasion, but they're picky eaters so I'm not sure if it's them or the quality of product. Worth a shot for the price."
4,Rampart Rocks!,"Rampart rocks.... I first played it in an arcade in 1993, and it's pure fun... using Tetris like pieces to build walls around castles and then shoot ships with different attacks... The two modes (build and fight) are extremely clever. This port isn't perfect. There are bugs. Sometimes the tanks shoot one castle and another blows up. But it's good simple fun.... Not being a DS game, I can't save my level, so instead I have to leave the power on and have it plugged in at work, so I can continue on my way home..."
4,Facsinating ideas,"This very interesting book manages to cram in plots about censorship, gender equity, and remorse into a fast paced story. In the far future, Robin is on the run from his past after having his memory surgically altered. He volunteers to be a guinea pig in a research project in a mock-up of 20th century Earth civilization. Only then does he begin to learn that this refuge isn't as safe as it seems. Stross takes very interesting liberties with gender roles as some of his characters morph in to bodies of different sexes or other species entirely. When the people of the future are forced to live under 20th century moral structures, sparks really fly! While the learning curve is pretty steep, with Stross throwing around a lot of terms regarding the futuristic technology, there's a good story here which leaves much food for thought."
2,get this at the library,"ok i'm bitter about this book - it's just barely adequate for stross. I don't really understand what original ideas the author explores in this book. Whereas Accelerando was truly original and deep and the Atrocity Archives was amusing and a refreshing take on the Cthulhu mythos, this is neither. I guess it was my fault - i had been reading Nabokov before this book. Frankly this is unfair but Stross should stick to profound exciting ideas because he's great at it but this book is not about that - this is about people and character development and i'm afraid i came away from this book not really caring about the people or what they were going through or what happened to them."
3,Harry meets zombies,"While it is not my favorite of the series, this novel was one of the more popular titles in the series because it included a new look at zombies and has Harry riding 'Sue' down the streets of Chicago. Dead Beat had a lot of memorable moments and characters it just lacked something for me. This still is a fun easy read and with everyone else loving it I would still recommend checking it out if you like Dresden."
5,Wow!,"It's hard to compare Dead Beat to Butcher's other books, since all of them are excellent, and DB is no exception to this. Fast-paced action, lots of fighting, lots of witty jokes that had me laughing out loud.My only complaint (and a tiny one at that) was the interaction with Murphy. It seemed as if Butcher needed a reason for Murph to be out of the picture and I'm not sure I like the reason he came up with. Overall, though, there's nothing else I can complain about.As usual, Butcher pulls a previous supporting character from the past and fleshes them out, as he did with Butters the medical examiner. I would love to see more Butters, and I hope to see more of the Wardens like Ramirez.I highly recommend this book, and remember: Polka will never die!"
4,"Slow to start, but a killer finish",Dead Beat meanders a bit in the early going but comes together at its memorable conclusion when Harry Dresden pulls off his best trick yet.One of the three top Dresden Files novels.
4,A Must Read for Anyone Interested in the Gold Coast,Add a star if you are from Glen Cove or the local area. This book is not what I expected. I purchased thinking it would be an historical account of the mansion and its occupants but it turned out to a compelling ghost story. It was enjoyable and informative.
4,Winfield,"A throughly enjoyable account of Monica's unique experience living in and around the Winfield mansion and estate. I have often wondered what it would be like to ""live like royalty"" in such a place. Thankfully, it is still standing, rather than razed like so many others on Long Island and, closer to home for me, in the Philadelphia suburbs. Of course, she had a few unusual occurances there, but that is what makes the book that much more fun. Thank You for an enjoyable read."
4,Interesting read,"I enjoyed reading this book, but was wondering just how much of it is truth. The author seems to have a lavish imagination and takes it a bit over the edge at times. This book is not about historical events, but hear say. I wished it had more original pictures of the estate. Over all I enjoyed it, and would recommend it for a good reading book."
2,Too much assumptions,"Here's my scoop:1) The author assumes you already know PS6.0. At least an intermediate user.2) The author also assumes you are book publisher and knows what is a prepress plate, etc...3) Key-strokes/mouse-clicks about a feature to perform an operation in examples were not indicated clearly in his book. E.g. ""Double-click the highlight eyedrop-per icon in the dialog box"" when there are 3 eyedrop icons. Which one is he talking about?4) The explanations about Levels in Chapter 8 can be expanded much further to explain in more details what each button means and why I need to do it. How is it related to photography.In short, I'm very disappointed and frustrated with this book and pretty much fooled by its title."
4,The Photographer's Companion for Photoshop 6,"This book is geared more towards the photographer as well as the Photoshopper with the understanding of the handling of images for Photoshop. The book is written by a photographer, Martin Evening, who uses Photoshop himself.. Photographer's as well as the layman will benefit from this book. He goes into the basics as well as advanced techniques for Photoshop 6. Being a photographer myself and an advanced Photoshopper, I found the book to be basic in some chapters and in others, very helpful. The power of this book lays in the companion CD rom. The tutorial's on the cd rom add to the power of this book."
4,Great Deal for the Price,"I've had the item for 3 weeks now, and it works better and has already lasted longer than a similar item that I bought from Best Buy for $25. I had to adjust the treble and bass levels on my car stereo but it sounds great once you make those adjustments. I wasn't expecting much when I received this item considering the price but it's defintely worth it."
1,Very poor quality,"The right and left volume changes when moving the tape cartridge. Very poor sound quality, do not waste your money on this. I ended up just buying a new car stereo that supports the use of my Apple I-POD touch."
3,faulty wires,the tape was great and the price definitely lowered my expectations but one issue I have with it is that there always seems to be one layer or one part of the song being played too quiet to hear ( i.e. the guitar solo or the back up vocals just aren't audible during the song)
1,Reviews,Arrived quickly but this product doesnt work that well at all I didnt pay much at all though so I wasnt too disapointed
1,Rubbish,"Not even worth the low price I paid for this. First of all, the sound quality is horrific. It sounded like my music had been recorded underwater. I could have stood for that because it was cheap, but the tape itself also emits an awful bass tone which gets exponentially louder as you turn the volume up, making listening to music at a reasonable volume impossible. After a couple uses, the thing was already beginning to completely fail and I had to jostle it around in the tape player to even get it to play. After just a few days of using it I threw it in the garbage out of sheer frustration. I recommend instead of this, buying a good FM-transmitter. Not just because this tape was crap, but also because tape decks are really no longer in cars anymore and their use should not be encouraged. The fracking CD is already over 20 years old."
3,Makes annoying noise.,"Works ok, but makes an annoying clicking sound inside the tape deck. You usually can't hear it when your music is playing though. It gets the job done."
1,Would not buy again,"I received this adapter and hooked it up to my iPhone and only the right channel worked. I've tried everything i can to fix it, including taking it apart and resoldering the connections. Still, the right channel is the only one working. Would not buy again."
2,You get what you pay for,"It only gets sound from one side or the other on my car stereo, Going to end up getting an iPod adapter hooked up to the cd changer controller on the stereo."
1,Broken out of the box,"Didn't even worked when I opened it. Turned up the volume on the car and ipod all the way, and just static; tried it in 2 cars. Bought a different one from somewhere else for a couple bucks more, and it worked great. This isn't worth it at all. Figured it would be worth the risk because of the price"
3,Sidewalks of London,"Vivien Leigh was in this movie right before GONE WITH THE WIND!!!!!!!! But this movie is about a homeless girl who is named Liberty <nicknamed Libby>, who then a big man <charles laughton> meets Libby and takes her under his wing and gives her a home, and a job in his street performing group. But then abother man <Rex Harrison> meets Libby, and makes her a star and super famous and wealthy. But Libby wants Charles Laughton.This movie is not a MUST SEE but it is rather good. The scenes without Vivien are kind of slow moving and dull, and the movie has the worst ending. The absoulute worst ending in a movie. She runs after Charles Laughton, and then he goes to his crew and starts a poem. Leaving Libby back to the thearter. IF YOU LIKE VIVIEN LEIGH, I'D RECCOMEND YOU SEE THIS FILM"
5,Information Highway,"This book was not only educational but also extremely informative. If you are ever entering the business world, in any area, this book is a must. It guides you through the step by step process of public storage while also giving you strong business tips that will last a lifetime."
3,Good value,"The tongs were a bit stiff, but I used WD40 to loosen the joints. They were longer that what I wanted, but the price was right. The only negative was that the shipping cost was more than the cost of the product."
3,Interesting but didn't live up to expectations,"I wish I could be as positive as the other reviewers, because I liked the author's personality that came through in this book--she's feisty, irreverent, and not afraid to speak her mind. But ultimately this book disappointed me. It strikes me that the author should have waited longer to write it. Too much of it seemed like bits of experience strung together without enough reflection on what the experiences mean. I also disliked the way she simply inserted the text from her sermons. She's obviously a talented preacher, but the texts alone were frequently flat and uninteresting.That said, I hope she continues to publish--we need to hear a voice like hers in Christianity."
5,"Great, believeable, intelligent characters.","I enjoyed the entire story line. The old murder mixed in with the current lives of the present day folks. I loved Simon, his interpretation of the south. And I also want to hear more about his developing relationship with Julia."
4,Feeling of being in the story,"I pick up this book at my local library, just before the the auther was going to come speak. I finished in about 2 days and found it a very fun read. Since I live in Raleigh, I have walk on the same sidewalks through the neighborhoods and colleges mentioned in the story. I found myself in the story most the the way through. By that I mean that the stressors or distractions of my world melted away as I was absorbed into Simon's world. I like that in a book."
3,"Entertaining read, poor editing and format","The story was entertaining, but it dragged on in too many places. After all of the long, detailed descriptions of characters and settings, I did not expect the end of the book to be left to the reader's imagination. It seemed like the author just stopped writing, and did not intend for the book to end there. I don't know if the horrible mistakes in the text were due to the Kindle formatting, or the poor editing. There were several glaring spelling errors as well as mistakes with dates in the book."
4,Good read,"The only real complaint I have is that there are several places where a date should be, and it's just left blank. Also, in one instance, it says that some guns were made from 1965 through 1935 . I'm just picky like that..."
4,When history means more than just a name and a date,"You get someone like Professor Simon Shaw, as envisioned by Sarah R. Shaber. The youngest, the smallest and possibly the only Jewish professor at a small southern college, Simon is both one who can teach and remember history, but cares about the people who lived it. Sometimes even to disregard his own safety.It is also a well-defined set of characters, all giving some insight into their chosen fields of study, reasons why their 'personal spaces' may be at odds with that choice, and a real talent for interweaving the past, present and attitudes from both to show a snippet of a life into which some unusual adversity has been thrown.Most certainly I will be reading the others in her series."
3,Promises much but doesn't quite deliver,"After reading the first three chapters, I was completely hooked--this promised to be one of the best mysteries I'd read in a long while. But then the plot languished. The characters became too talky, too self-consciously quirky. Worst of all, the denouement was predictable and the book more or less disintegrated. Still, I would give considerable credit for the opening portion and hope, when I read the author's second book, that the plotting is improved."
3,Simon Said,"Good story, just several places that were boring to get through. It was a lovely clean book, i.e. no solicitous sex, language, gore. The mystery was fun. I would recommend it for a quick read. Very easy to put down and pick up later after a break and know where you were. I love the historical aspect of it."
4,Sting of the Scorpion,"Sting of the Scorpion - Realistic and accurate true stories.My dad fought in the North African Desert as well as Alamien,"
5,Awesome LCD TV,"This is a fantastic TV for both the quality and the money. The 720 actually has a better picture than the 1080. The 1080 blows out the whites quite a bit and didn't have as good deep blacks. It comes with many high-end inputs and the look is great. I would not trade this TV for any of the more expensive ones if someone offered to swap. Frankly, the picture is undeniably sharp and I watch a lot of sports in HD. Let's just say I've really been enjoying the NBA playoffs this year. If anyone is thinking about taking the plunge into the HD world, you can not go wrong with this TV. I'd be happy to respond to any questions but if you go look at this TV and compare, I think you'll be sold."
4,Like being a kid again...,"I remember watching these as a kid after school and it's everything I remembered it to be. Now I can watch it with my boys and relive the fun all again. Quality of picture and sound are great and you've gotta love that old-school transforming sound!The only complaint I have is that they actually put in the transition to commercial screens ""Transformers will return in a moment"" and ""And now back to Transformers"". I was expecting maybe some old Transformer toy commercials which would have at least been nostalgic, but this is just wasted time, in my opinion."
5,Excellent Reference,"Although I'm a graphic designer and not a writer, I found this book extremely helpful. Most sales books come from the perspective of selling a product - very different from selling a service. Bob has an excellent way of translating the sales process for those of us who depend on repeat business. He also includes very relevant cautions. Relationship selling requires good chemistry and common sense, as opposed to a product sale where numbers are the only concern. I would (and have often) recommend this to anyone who has a service to sell."
5,Look no further to sell more services,"Robert Bly is amazing. I have increased my earnings many fold based on the advice in this book. Today, as someone who coaches independent professionals on how to find more clients, I always point them to the money-making secrets in this book."
1,Outdated information,"The information provided in this book was written before R5 was available. Anyone currently using R5 would find this book not helpful since the information does not apply to R5. The examples provided requires extensive modification if one wants to run them in R5. However, if you are using R4.6, then you will find this book helpful.If you want a book to learn the ins and outs of R5, do not buy this book."
2,The book was written long before Domino R5 shipped.,"This book is mostly about Domino R4.6 design techniques. About 20% of the book describes an early beta version of Domino R5. Notes R5 has not yet shipped and the most recent beta, build 164.1, differs substantially from the version that this book describes."
2,Universal size fits up to a mens size 10. Really?,"In the description: ""Universal size fits up to a mens size 10.""Wow. That's ""universal""? I don't know what percentage of men wear shoes size 10.5 or larger, but it must be pretty high. Around a third, maybe? Why would they rule out such a large percentage of potential customers, or pretend that up to size 10 is ""universal"" and would cover everybody? I'm 5'11"", only slightly above average height for men, and I wear a size 10.5 shoe. Good luck guys.."
2,Poultrygeist... the let down,So I bought this movie in anticipation of it being bad...really bad actually. I love cheesy horrible horror flicks but this was one of the worst I have ever seen. Not once did I see a review mentioning it to be a musical. It seemed for the first 45 minutes of the movie they broke into song and dance every chance they could. Once was funny.. twice was ok.. by the time you hit the third song you just want it to end. Rent it if you can and decide for yourself.
1,I underestimated how low Troma can sink,"I have seen some other Troma films, so I was not expecting great art. But I wasn't expecting excrement either. Excrement is what I got. I was able to sit through the scene where the naked 500 pound man has a supernaturally intense bout of projectile diarrhea. But I was beaten when the hero burst into song while mopping it up. I doubt that I will ever watch the rest of this garbage.Yes folks, this is a musical. But the songs are really bad and it is very tedious listening to them. There is plenty of nudity, but none of the actors (or actresses) are very attractive so the nudity is also just tedious. The producers wanted a movie that is as gross as possible. And they got it. Looking for a really gross flick? Look no further. But if you are looking for anything else, do yourself a favor and keep looking. This film is disgusting. This is only the second time that I have rated a film one star."
3,My very first Troma movie,"My very first time seeing a Troma movie! About what I expected, I guess. Even with a 15 minute intro and a total run-time of 103 minutes, this still felt too long. Most of the songs needed to be cut down (or cut out completely, imo). But there were some laughable moments - mostly whenever the movie goes so over the top that it becomes silly. I mean, why use a quart of blood when you have 10 gallons just sitting there? Funny enough to watch once, but no need to ever revisit it."
2,Not a great book,"I love to read. Espeacially fantasies. I was so excited to see this book sitting on the shelf, after reading a great mermaid book I had to read more. This book was not at all intended for me. It was a story collection and none were very good. I thought a lot more work could have been added and more descriptions. I only recomend it to children in 3rd grade, though it does not have pictures for the younger. I highly suggest that if you are any older then don't read it. I disliked it a lot, the stories were really cheesy."
2,dirty blondes 2 review,"I would agree with the other reviews of this movie and say it isn't that great. it is unrated but deserves nothing better than an ""R"" rating because you can see the same type of action on a premium channel, i.e.showtime or the movie channel."
4,excelllent cook book,the recipe's in this cookbook are so easy...plus most people will have the ingredients already in their cubboards. very few trips to the store to buy that special one.
1,Sucks,"When I received this game, I placed the CD in my computer. What I found was there was no programs on the CD. In other words no game info. So I still do not know how the game is."
3,Pretty Good but filler,Rick James& His Crew really shine here including the Mary Jane Girls&Val Young.Thomas Mcclary&tHe Commodores give it as well.Debarge gets right as well.but overall it becomes to Watered-Down.alot of Formula sounding Production&high 80's Gloss hurt some of the material here.still a few good songs here&there.
5,Great documentary,"Stephen Lang does a great job narrating, and the action is non stop. One of the best documentaries about Gettysburg out there."
1,Heretic,"Moltmann is a false teacher. Read ""On Being a Theologian of the Cross"" by Gerhard Forde if you are actually looking for good theology."
5,Highly Recommended,"I purchased this video at the Lincoln Memorial gift shop in Washington, DC...so, evidently I'm not alone in recommending this fine, compact biography. There are many Brady (or Brady-esque) photographs that I had never seen before, Some splendid drawings and political cartoons of the era, great narrations of Lincoln's writings; and, some uncharacteristically lively interviews with historians representing many different points of view on the great man. Like the previous reviewer, I found this to be an unusually engaging A&E. It made me laugh out loud at times, tear up with sympathy, and catch my breath in astonishment. Very worth anyone's time and a great instruction aid for home school or any teacher."
4,Bursting with information,"I'm delighted with Victoria Edward's Aromatherapy Companion. The book is bursting with usable information. Along with an extensive list of essential oils, their properties and applications, and a close look at carrier oils and the opportunities they present, the book contains a simple introduction to the complex subject of aromachemistry and a rationally presented discussion of safety and toxicity, along with scads of recipes and activities with which to ""get one's feet wet."" But that's just half the book. Then there's the wealth of lore, history, mythology, personal anecdote and modern mystic interpretation that brilliantly addresses the appeal of aromatherapy to the creative and artistic instinct."
3,Some misinformation-safety issues,"Overall a good index of essential oils and their uses. Addresses all aspects of aromatherapy. Maybe a little too much historical information.Book is well indexed making info easy to find. Addresses the usefullness of aromatherapy for many specific ailments. However, I found the section relating to aromatherapy during pregnancy very disturbing in that the author recommends massaging the legs and ankles which is expressly contraindicated.Krista Morris, NCMT (certified peri-natal massage therapist)"
3,Caution for would-be users of this product,"I would like to warn would-be buyers of these pliers that they should make sure it will work for them. The tips of these pliers are so large because of the swapping feature (i.e., the two nuts) that I couldn't get the pliers into the tight spots where I needed to use them. The tips of the pliers couldn't reach the snap rings I was trying to remove."
3,Mediocre binoculars with a neat party trick,"I'm not very impressed with the Papilo binoculars for bird watching. I find that there are very distracting internal reflections in the binoculars as if Pentax had never heard of optical coatings. And as you pan the binoculars, you can actually see the optical distortions at the edges of the lens. I suspect that this lack of optical quality is in service to the Papilio's one party trick, which admittedly is a really good one. The close focusing feature of the binoculars works very well and offers a quite unusual perspective on the otherwise ordinary world of bugs and blossoms. So if you're a budding entomologist or just have bad eyesight, these binoculars are great for keeping track of what's going on right under your nose. For distance viewing, though, you can do much better."
3,Loose mechanism inside perhaps,Received the Pentax 62216 binoculars today and began putting them to the test immediately. I loved everything about them when it came to using the in your face up close viewing.The only complaint that I have it that when moving them around in my hand there's a rattle. It seems that the internal zooming mechanism is loose or something. Is this the way there built or is it just the pair I received. Any feed back would be appreciated.
4,Beautiful but they make me feel stupid,"Read all the rave reviews and bought. They're beautiful and well-made, light and feel good. So why do I feel stupid? Because, for the life of me, I can't read the instructions and, therefore, can't make them work. Does anyone have a ""How to use your Papilios for Dummies?Thanks!"
4,Up close and personal,"I had been looking for some time for a set of compact close-focus binos for butterfly and moth observation, and as a light-weight backup when not carrying my birding glasses, when I stumbled upon the Pentax Papilio.I am astounded at the close-focus capability of these glasses. There is, quite simply, nothing on the market in the same league. At 8.5x21, the exit pupil is quite small and it required a little bit of patience to get everything adjusted to my liking. The payoff was well worth the initial trial and error tinkering as I was introduced to a new world of close-up nature observation.At long distances, there is a slight bit of noticeable chromatic aberration, but well within the range of acceptability for backup use and probably acceptable for most folks for general use. There are a lot of fine field glasses available for different purposes - if close focus is the most important feature for you, you will not be disappointed with the Papilio's."
2,5...6...7....8....9....9 1/2....,"The film opens with Bugle (Alvin Cowan) working as a boxing hustler. There is also a subplot about gold on Black Claw land. Prospectors are killed. The deed holder has an idea that if they get a girl kidnapped (Katy Maloney) the cavalry will wipe out the Indians and they will be free to dig.The film had some minor humor in it. There were anachronisms in the speech, especially the Indian woman (Kristen Alaniz) whose speech greatly contrasted the cliche Indian talk used by the rest of her tribe. The acting and script were Asylum grade bad. The beautiful scenery that normally accompanies westerns was not present as it appears most of the filming was done on a set. The Indian bows had all the spring and appearance of a dime store bow and arrow set.Unless you want camp and cheese, avoid the film.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
4,A must for anyone going to Russia!,"This woman has managed to see things that some of us, Russians, are unable to notice, for the reality we live in is too close to our eyes. This book gave me a rare pleasure to see our people and places in a new, clearer, nearly stereoscopic, light."
5,AMAZING live band.,"I was lucky enough to see the band, with Dulli and Mark Lanegan handling vocals on ""Live with Me"" live in San Francisco back in mid-2000s, and I've never been so damn jealous of talent in my life. Just a powerhouse of a band, and Lanegan somehow manages to lower the goddamned barometric pressure in the room with his vocals. It's like watching a black hole on stage... his gravitational pull is so strong no light can escape...but for the crazy red dwarf that is big Greg Dulli. He's like the raconteur slightly-evil Old World uncle you always wished you had to slip you smokes and drinks and family gatherings, but with a vocal range that can go from a Rod Stewart rasp to a Prince falsetto in one measure.One of my favorite bands. Cue up the 30-second sample of ""Live with Me,"" and you'll be convinced as well."
3,"Close, but not exact fit","I purchased this radiator as a replacement for my OEM 1999 Honda Accord radiator.It appears to be well constructed, but there were two flaws that came up onlyas the radiator was installed -- the fan attachment points for the passengerside cooling fan are slightly different than the OEM radiator, with theinboard attachment point about a half-inch high and half-inch left of whereit belongs. The other issue is that the OEM radiator cap does not fit, thussending me on a wild goose chase to find one that does."
1,Rayman,"We bought this use game, it was suppose to be in good condition. It had a deep scratch in it and it doesn't work. I lost my receipt so I couldn't return it. I am very displease by the seller saying it was in good working condition when it doesn't even work!!!!!!!!"
5,Just what the Ponds is,A very Good moisturizer for the Face and the Whole Body. Was a great Stocken stuffer for the One who is Hard to Buy For
3,Hmmm,I don't know if this does the trick or not. I have been using Cetiphil (spelling?) and in the shower I use a small face pad and moisturizing cleanser to clean and hydrate my face.I probably wont buy this again. Smells nice though
4,OK,"and read some of these guy's experience [...]I have 40 years tech experience. The kit assembled easily, all parts were there, but unit does not function. The fault is like that described in the first couple reviews you'll find on the link above.I see amazon prohibits link addresses. The reviews I tried to cite are on eham - dot - com. You can find them I'm sure.Epilogue: A tech support guy at Ramsey suggest flipping D1. That worked, so I took my rating to four stars. I might only suggest a note in the instructions about this (there is no ""troubleshooting"" section)."
5,Coffee Table Art,"The Wilco Book is a great book if you enjoy the creative process. This book is less about the band and more about how they record, why they do it, and what the environment around them looks or feels like while they are doing it. It's an open-minded look at a process most of us don't enjoy on the same scale, but that we can all relate to in our own creative lives.The accusations of pretense are understandable. But if you are someone who loves the process as much as the finished product this will be an inspiring piece. The cd and the book fit perfectly together in creating a mood of idea exploration. I found this book insightful and a very nice addition to a progressingly great body of work."
2,difficult and error measurement,"the measurement is not accurate. The reading is lower than the real temperature (compared with my other theromometers including the traditional one)if you take 2-3 times consequently, the reading will vary a lot(around 1-2F). I have to believe the highest one. It is very confuse.I think the problem is not from incorrect using. Since these problems happened in adult as well as children."
3,Something worth thinking about,"Although I do not agree with the author of this book going to porn conventions, the book made me look at my own life and how easily I judge others. The book is worth reading, if it does nothing but to make one look at how he or she reaches the lost, as we all need to be doing. We all have an area of our life we could be opening up and sharing with someone that might bring them to a relationship with Christ. Since reading the book, I have started my own journey of trying to talk to at least one new person daily about Jesus. I am also praying for an understanding heart and to be more open to how other people reach our Lord and Savior."
2,Jackson 5,Both jewel cases for these cd's were cracked & broken.It would be nice to have replacements sent out.
4,Helpful and Informative,"My colleague Dr. James McCluskey gives an insider's account of how to advise, operate, and manage a student radio station. He writes from first hand experience and shares from his personal accounts what can realistically be expected. He has sucessfully operated stations in various parts of the U.S. Dr. McCluskey has the academic credentials to go along with the experience he describes. Having obtained his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan and his PhD from Kansas State University, he is a ""hands on"" academic. He has been on both sides of the podium, i.e., in the field and in the lecture room. In terms of staying active, he regularly presents research at professional conferences throughout the country. As a result he stays current in the field as it continually changes."
4,Works well,"This keeps my hair back while I wash my face at night and keeps facial products, including messy masks, from getting in my hair. So for that purpose, it's great.Someone recomended this for use at the gym and, while I guess it probably would keep sweat out of one's hair, it is (in my opinon) a bit cumbersome to wear in public. So I wouldn't recomend it for that purpose but it probably would get the job done."
4,Good Headphones,These headphones work very well. I'm inside a manufacturing plant with all kinds of machinery and they work very well. I have actually went farther than the range. Probably around 500 to 600 feet. Even outside in the parking lot inside my car and they still pick up. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I didn't recieve an ac adapter with mine.
3,"Ok headphones, but not completely there...","Sound quality is good, and the fit/comfort is excellent.My gripe is with interference, specifically cell phone interference. I use them at work, and every time someone's cell phone goes off in 20-30 foot range, the headphones start crackling (technical term, for sure)."
1,Junk!!! Stay away,"I bought these for use with my plasma tv but the sound is so bad that they are unuseable. Way to much static, the sound is louder in one ear than the other and you have to continually fidle with them to get any reception at all. Do not buy these!!!"
1,The Trouble With Tribble,"Several reveiwers here have eluded to Geraldine Tribble's manuscript on Neuron Disintgeration analysis. The problem is that Tribble's analysis is only valid if the House Commission's conclusions of two shooters is correct, and the Fontaines do not express a solid opinion on this. I agree that the Fontaine book is a work of fantasy fiction, but reviewers should get their facts straight: Geraldine Tribble's theory does not apply here."
1,Follow the Rods,"In their meticulously documented magnum opus, OSWALD TALKED, Ray and Mary La Fontaine uncover evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald brought curtain rods to the Texas School Book Depository on the morning of November 22, 1963. Definitively researched and immaculately written, the wisdom of OSWALD TALKED becomes more evident with each passing year, as the work grows in stature with the turning of Time's pages...like a vintage wine."
3,"far from ""The Grand Design""","on its own, this book is not bad. after reading ""The Grand Design"" though, it was a disappointment. biagio's scheme this time is abvious and not very convincing (the single dreadnought threatening talistan...doh!) and his characters are one-dimensional and boring, especially biagio. no comparison to the old and far more complex count biagio, or bishop herrith, nicabar and the others. what a pity! after the grand design I thought: whew! finally someone to challenge George Martin! but after that boring tale without twists or turns.... no Mr Marco I expected more."
2,Not a very good Rough Guide,"I've been a huge fan of Rough Guides and have used them extensively over the past 15 years or so while traveling to various countries. The Rough Guide to Chile 3 was a relative disappointment. Information is buried in text and hard to parse. I found the Fodor's to be much, much more useful to the extent that we just stopped looking at the Rough Guide at all after a few days. If you just want to glance at cities as you tour them and look for specific things to do (eat, stay, shop, etc.) this really isn't the book for you. We had a rental car and are huge fans of ad hoc touring and this guide wasn't really conducive to that at all."
5,Great Clock,"Can't imagine why someone gave this item only one star. It is NOT plastic, and looks great with my country antiques. Love the rubbed black finish, and it has been keeping perfect time for almost three years in my home."
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed reading the book.It was a little sappy in some parts, but overall a touching love story."
5,Baby's First Nativity,"This a very colorful and wonderfully illustrated childrens book. It tells the story of Jesus' birth in a rhyming way that keeps my son interested. I purchased the book for my 1.5 yr old son at Christmas time and 4 months later he is still carrying it around by the handle every where we go. He loves to hear the story of Jesus' birth over and over, and now one of the first words that he has learned to say is ""Jesus"". I am pleased that I bought this book and next I will purchase either ""Baby's First Bible"" or ""Baby's First Catholic Bible"" to add to our reading selection."
4,Pretty good for the price.,"Put this in my Y2K Subaru as a replacement for a plugged up OEM one. Fit was slightly off, but didn't cause any problems. Quality is good and so far, no overheating. Good enough!"
3,Poor on information,"I have bought this DVD in hope to help me in my Taekwondo learning, but i becaume very dissapointing.No names in Corean, it doesn't bellong to WTF - World Taekowndo Fedaration.Amazon must update the information, not 10 dvd's but only 1."
5,Be Healthy!,Sometimes you just need to schedule the time to work on your health like you schedule other things in your life. What this DVD & live healthy. You are worth it!
5,An amazing story,"A fascinating story of conquest, greed, and betrayal, written in a clear, fast-moving fashion. I've always wondered how a few Spaniards could conquer the massive Aztec empire, and now it makes sense to me."
2,Good day time photos not so good at night,"slow recovery after night time shots , lots of blurry photos ,maybe its the camera or maybe I just don't know how to use it correctly. Not real impressed ."
5,"Perfect, non-leaking pads","Have an older Shih-Tzu that can't always hold it, and isn't trained to ring the bell to go out like our bulldog does. He has two ""go to"" carpeted places and these pads cover those areas perfectly. We were using $15 non-fitted mattress protectors from Target, put the vinyl backs were not holding up well to repeated washing and drying and had started to leak. These pads are thicker and more absorbent, they are already holding up better than the mattress protectors. Very happy with these and will be purchasing two more for spares."
1,heed this warning,These tools are garbage. Coathangers litterally worked better after I bought and bent this tool to crap.
5,The right tool for the job!,"If youre a diy-er and the stereo must come out, this kit contains the two most popular devices for the job!"
4,bendable,Not ever having used anything like this I bent the crap out of these before I was successful at getting my radio out.They worked as they were supposed to and fit my radio properly.
1,Poor quality,"While the tool is necessary to remove most radios, the set I got was of such poor quality, it totally failed to do the job. The looped parts have a notch at the ends that is supposed to grab the clips on the radio. My set had extra metal at the edges that prevented them from working easily. When I finally got them to grab on the seventh try, the loops themselves bent like they were made of tinfoil. Had to take the car in to get the radio removed. Laughable poor Chinese manufacturing."
1,Junk,"The other reviewer is right. Do not buy this. I happen to have version 1.65 and it may be even worse. I'm also in the IT business and I've not seen many products worse than this.My administrator password keeps resetting itself and you have to call them to get a temporary password. Of course, they almost never answer their phones.I had to uninstall it using regedit which I'm comfortable with but most home users would not want to go through that ordeal.I'd give it zero stars if I could."
4,Hard Hitting,"Well i think this game is fun but it is exsausting. You just go around and beat the same old baddies up. Plus only two characters can actually do good!(trini and jason) But me and my buds love playing it! Only i wish there was a two player mode, that would rock the house!"
1,Alien Abductions and hypnotic induced memories..,"This book is a text book case of hypnotically induced memories for the sake of UFO disinformation, I will give three star in other subject :MIND CONTROL.The only ""aliens"" who really want to take samples of your tissue have your same DNA and wear camuflage uniforms...don't waste your money with this one."
4,Very Interesting Book,I did find this a very interesting read but I do plan to go back and read it again at some point to make sure I did not miss anything.
2,The cover design could be better.,"I really don't judge a book by its cover, but the cover could have at least had some boat or something on it."
4,An accurate telling of the Titanic,"I've read many non-fiction books about the Titanic. But this is the first survivor story that I've actually read. It is perfect! Lawrence Beesley's telling of the Titanic's sinking is quite in depth, as he is quite acquainted with the knowledge he shared in his book, but at the same time, it is set forth in an easily understood fashion.He tells of the people he interacted with on board --- the people he met again, rescued on the Carpathia -- and the people that he did not meet again.I immensely enjoyed learning facts upon the subjects of temperatures, icebergs, mileage, lifeboats, and ship communication at sea. What an intelligent man Beesley must have been, to have know so many angles to look at each topic from.Every Titanic buff should read his tale!"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY (and time!),"This book was a complete waste of money and time. If I could give it NEGATIVE 5 STARS, I would.Other than the myriad of spelling, grammatical and editing mistakes that makes one wonder about the quality of the information in the book, the actual content adds absolutely nothing to Canada's official immigration website...oh, sorry, no the author does add a very sorry 20 page summary of his views of the most ""efficient"" time management and efficiency techniques(""7 habits of successful people""-style)(sooooo lame), adding ""good luck"" every other page. Plus the final annex is top notch if you don't know how to use google or any other search engine as it lists on an excel spreadsheet (!!) job search sites (didn't I say the editing was pathetic? Well the outlay and graphics too) ...For a good book on immigrating to Canada get: ""Living and Working in Canada"", now that's a quality book!"
4,Solid book with one sad part,"It's excellent. I bought one like this and landscaped a showpiece home in nc. So we want to now do the same in Florida, our new home. Love the information. Really sad that the pictures are not in color. I would not have bought the book. Oh well i will study it like a text book in school."
5,Florida plants,Great book with illustrations and pictures that give a good visual for what they look like. (Please don't judge me on my grammar.) :)
5,Wonder Live,"Natural Wonder is Stevie Wonder's first live album since his 1963 debut release 12 Year Old Genius. Thirty plus years after the fact, the title genius still applies. The concert shows off everything that makes Mr. Wonder a national treasure, amazing voice, great instrumentalist and supreme songwriting. The album contains all the big hits including great versions of ""Living For The City"", ""Superstition"", ""Higher Ground"", ""My Cherie Amour"", ""I Wish"", and ""Master Blaster (Jammin')"". He also serves up lesser known songs like ""Pastime Paradise"" (The song Coolio samples for ""Gangsta Paradise""), ""Village Ghetto Land"", ""Another Star"", ""Stay Gold"" (Theme from The Outsiders) & ""Overjoyed"". He does a nice tribute to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan in ""Stevie Ray Blues"" and some new songs like ""If It's Magic"" and ""Ms. & Mr. Little Ones"" are pretty good."
5,you'll never regret buying this one!,"Natural Wonder showcases Stevie at his best, surrounded by a full orchestra that complements his expressive songs consistently and powerfully. This album truly is a natural wonder-one of the most moving, magical albums you'll ever hear. The album opens up with Dancing To The Rythm, a chill-inducing, beautiful tribute to Stevie's personal faith in God. The album goes on to include nearly every one of Stevie's biggest hits, with some of the true standouts on the album being the electrifying ""Another Star"", ""Superstition,"" and ""Overjoyed."" However, there's not a song on here that won't please. There's no limit to this wonderful man's creativity or talent."
2,Easily Broken,I took this box to three shows before its front snaps broke. During the shows it was infrequently accessed and snapped when I tried to open it normally. I think it was because the plastic latches are too thin and brittle. I would not recommend buying this box until the company replaces the latches with metal ones. The front hole for putting a small padlock through also did not come pre-drilled. Had it not broken so easily I think it would have been a great box - good storage capacity and easy to carry.
5,"Small or large, Howard Miller rocks.",I was very happy to get a Howard Miller clock for a small space in my kitchen. High quality for a reasonable price.
1,Disappointed,"Six months after the first review regarding wrong edition was posted in February 2010 we ordered the book assuming that Amazon had corrected this issue.Sad to say, the book pictured on the order page is not consistent with the book shipped (International Edition: Not for use inside the US).To make matters worse, my last two orders (placed over 2 weeks ago) no longer appear in the history and the Order ID Search did not recognize the ID.At least the phone interaction was satisfactory with the customer service rep.If you had updated the web page with the correct information or shipped the book as advertised we would not have had to had called.At this point we are forced to go with another option."
3,proceed with caution before ordering this. there are several editions about!,"there are multiple versions of this book out, and all share the same isbn. a 1993 first edition pb can have 190 pages or 246 pages. the 2004 second edition (shown in the pictures, even though the listing details are for the 1993 1st edition) has 300+ pages with new material and updates.I ordered this book, thinking I was getting the 2004 second edition pictured, with bob flaws annotations. what I received was neither the 246 page 1st edition book listed nor the second edition book pictured, but rather the very first edition of 190 pages.take the time to write to your seller first and be certain of which version you are getting!"
3,"Cheap, not good quality",This item was inexpensive and it sure looks that way. Button already fell off. It's a very small unit. Did its job but if you need something more sturdier look at something else. Arrived quickly though as promised.
5,Keeps my toes warm,Its a heater. It does the job. I don't hate getting out of the warm shower into the cold bathroom anymore.
1,Poor Quality,"This was a not a good 1st experience. The picture I received looked as if it was printed on a low grade printer, it came complete with green and yellow streaks down it. After several weeks of waiting for a call tag to return it I finally insisted that the company give me his UPS or FEDEX account number which he would not divuldge to me. He told me to keep the picture( which I threw away) and gave me a credit. In all fairness he did eventually supply me with a Fedex label but when I went online to print it Fedex would not allow it. In my opinion, this is a one man band trying to make some extra money via the internet, Good Luck!!!"
5,Must Read,A must read. Funny how southern folks use phrases or words everyday without realizing it. As a born and raised southern I love this book!
1,Just Skip It,"I'm a nut butter addict, so I was excited to try a nut butter that was finally low-cal. But, of course, I was just disappointed. It says it's ""all natural,"" but it leaves a really distinct, gross, artificial after-taste. It doesn't really taste like peanut butter- and it just does not come close to any nut butter. I personally think it's awful. Plus it's expensive! Forget about the calories and eat regular nut butter- it definitely tastes better!"
2,Definitley not peanut butter,"If you are looking for something that tastes like peanut butter, this is not it. If you are looking for a lower calorie, lower fat substitute to put on a sandwich, etc. then it will do. Be prepared for a whole new flavor - it is an acquired taste."
1,HORRIBLY SUGARY SWEET!!!,"Just got a 6 pack of Better'n Peanut Butter 16 Oz original. My elderly mother pointed out it was full of sugars and syrups- i had not tried it yet. I found it is horribly sweet and sugary, tastes like a honey/syrup-peanut butter and nothing like peanut butter at all. regret that i now have 6 jars, would never buy it again"
5,JA Jance,"I enjoyed this book very much. In fact, I have enjoyed all the books I have read by this author."
1,laughably bad,"An experienced homicide detective goes to the funeral of a murder victim, notices a gorgeous rich woman at the funeral and starts having superlative sex with her the next day, without even considering that this just might be a conflict of interest since she might be implicated in the murder, which of course she is, but first they must go shopping for sheets, towels, table linens and wedding clothes, because, yup, they actually get married after knowing each other for exactly one week. The sex scenes are ludicrous. This is a very strange fantasy to have been written by a woman, or anyone, actually, and it leaves the reader feeling a little queasy."
4,Until Proven Guilty,"I have always enjoyed reading J.A. Jance, and this book is no exception. It is a very good read, and I love the characters."
2,Different Stokes I Guess,"I really wanted to like this series, since I enjoy the Allison Reynolds series so much, but that was not the case. Homicide Detective J.P. Beaumont of the Seattle Police Department comes across as too gruff and too much of the typical stereotype cop that you see every night on television.When a five year old child is found dead and the mother is caught up in a fundamentalist cult you know that there is not going to be a happy ending. Plus, a well seasoned cop suddenly falling for a stranger and unexplainably dreams of their life together just doesn't blend well for me. This story was just too choppy and all over the place.I am glad that I had found the Reynolds series first or I would have just totally given up on this author. Different strokes I guess, but I will not be finding myself looking for anymore J.P. Beaumont."
5,"A well-researched, insightful book that is easy to read.","I really enjoyed this book. The author uncovers some new gems in the overall story of the Civil War and offers innumerable insights into the personal lives of Mary Lincoln and Elizabeth Keckly. I felt like I knew these women who were more real to me in ""Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly"" than they ever were in any of Abraham Lincoln's biographies or even in Elizabeth Keckly's own autobiography. The best part about reading this book was finally understanding how Lincoln and Keckly could have had a friendship that lasted for so long."
5,Mary & Friend,Love Love Love this book. To be able to have such a great friend especially in this era of time. Great book.
2,Picked a stinker,"I have to agree with some of the other negative reviews of this book. Poorly written, juvenile in its assumptions, overly simplistic and one dimensional characters. I picked this book based on the fact that it seemed to match some likes in the same categories. Wish I had another book on hand to read. Forced myself to read this and thoroughly did not enjoy it. I think I'll stay away from Ken and Jack in the future!"
1,Easily the worst book I've ever read--read it at your own risk,"I had seen some wonderful reader reviews for this book here, and I love a tightly written thriller as much as anyone, so I thought I'd give this a whirl. I was expecting, at the least, a page-turning, gripping read, and instead I found a book that is pretty much unreadable.Make no mistake--this book is trash. And it's not even good, fun trash. It's a sophomoric, pedestrian, shallow piece of crap with characters who bear little or no resemblance to thinking, feeling human beings and an idiotic plot. The authors never venture beyond simple, declarative sentences and pretty much reserve their limited descriptive powers for the female body. It makes the Da Vinci Code look like Shakespeare and Sidney Shelton look like Chekov.Don't say I didn't warn you."
3,Beaded Beads,"Nice concise little book with 30 different styles of beaded beads. Well-illustrated, with pretty clear instructions. Some of the instructions could have been a little more detailed, and I would advise only for someone with some experience with the different stitches."
3,Never be your woman...,An okay entertaining movie. Not Michelle Pfiefer's best but will do for movie time. There is some language and topics that makes it not a family movie.
1,The Eddie Black Story,This was an ok film. I was a bit disappointed that it was so grainy and low budget.
5,Real Eye-Opener,"THis is a wonderful book that I can't praise enough. If you - like me - have been putting off reading about Jackie Robinson and the other black baseball pioneers of the late 1940's and 1950's, this is the book for you. It's a shocking description of just what life was like for blacks at that time. It's a real eye-opener that needs to be read by all baseball fans and all students of American history."
3,"Ok, I guess","This game is ok I guess, I played it at my cousin's house. It'sgood for small children. I think it's pretty annoying just like thereal thing. But kids seem to enjoy it.The design a furby is pretty cool you can choose from a varity or colors to color your furby. I didn't get a chance to play with the games. And basically with this game you take care of your furby like it was a pet!"
2,"It's fun, but there isn't that many games.","It's a fairly decent game when it comes to size, but the fun-o-meter is set at 4 on a scale of one to ten. It has fun games, and the beanie wheather game is challenging. But there isn't very much to do, and there is only 4 games to play. Creating your own Furby is exciting, though. It even has inter-changable backgrounds! I was a little dissapointed though when I won all the games and beat my own high score, because after that there isn't much left to do except play and win the games all over again."
3,It is heavy,I got this for my Mom as she had a painful shoulder. It worked well except she complained that it was too heavy. If I had to do it over I would have gotten her a smaller model.
5,Excelent Music and Sound Restoration,"It's a perfect CD. It's got great old music, that has been perfectly restored! It doesn't get any better than that when you love vintage pop music!"
2,"Good pager, bad alarm","I do not suggest buying this alarm unless you are just replacing pagers for your alarm. When I received mine, the alarm horn did not work so I had to replace that. Then the receiver fell apart. The alarm has been in my car for less than a week and the relay has already popped. The remotes (pagers) have cheap and easily broken buttons and on mine the pink remote has slivers of plastic under the screen."
2,Disk failed after a short time,"I purchased ""The Secret"" in the Spanish format for my Puerto Rican wife. After using it for a very short time, she found it would no longer run on her computer. I have been waiting for her to return it to me so I can see about getting it replaced. I have the English version and I watch it several times a week and have not had any problems with it at all."
1,"IT iSn'T an ALL REGIONS DVD, DOESN'T WORK IN SPAIN DVD PLAYERS","What a pittyYour info about the dvd says it's an all regions dvd product.My LG dvd player with divx etc.. doesn't let me to watch the film.¿What can i do?Please, Don't sell it out of USA"
4,Vanity Fair Women's Illumination Brief,"There is one reason I do not rate the item 5 star. It does not have the Vanity Fair label sewn inside. It does not have any i.d. except for a typed label on the plastic bag in which it comes. If this is a new policy I am not aware of it as I haven't made any other recent purchases from Vanity Fair. Even so, it appears to be a good product and if time and washings bear out comparably. I find the fabric, color and construction satisfactory. However the size seems somewhat less generous than my other vanity fair panties but they still fit. If the seller has the briefs in the next size up I will purchase them and return the three I have now in receipt. If the preferred are not available I will settle for keeping these in lieu of none. Purchase made thru Amazon as NEW.C.Williams"
5,Original Complete Version is Best,"I have the original Cromwell version that was reissued in the US in 2007. This is a fantastic program and is the same one that was broadcst on the Discovery Channel. Much of this footage is from Russian archives and has not been seen before. The earlier edition put out by Eagle is incomplete as noted in the other review. You want to own the Cromwell edition of this program. This is the original, full length version not the other truncated versions. Ironically, the complete version is actually cheaper that the abridged version. Go figure."
4,Good shirt!,"I ordered this shirt because I am now a runner and I wanted to honor my grandpa in a couple of the races I ran. He always told me I should be a runner, but I used to laugh about it. :) The shirt is good quality and the print on it is thick enough that I've put it through the hot dryer many times already and there is no cracking in the paint. Glad I bought it!"
3,100 % satisfaction?,"There were no instructions supplied as to slice the cheese if required , thus my attempt to melt this baby on my cheeseburger was quite problematic- although once it all melted after an hour or so under the grill, i agree with Craig it is very cheesey. I think removing the wax coating before it goes under the grill will probably help next time- and improve the taste somewhat."
3,Product alright,The product was unopened/sealed when I received it. It arrived within a week. The production was exactly as described and expected.
1,Does not come close to doing what it should,"My wife normally takes one 50000 iu of calciferol (Vitamin D) for her missing parathyroids. We were hoping this would be similar, as it is made out to be. However she has to take two and half or three pills a day to match the same benefit. Very disappointed. Was hoping for an alternative because of costs."
5,Great product,I have MS and always need to take vitamin D . The prescription strengh is a little more expensive than this one. I didn't do a blood test yet to compare my levels . And they delivered pretty fast too even when I asked for regular delivery.
4,Good book,It was recommended by my mentor and she knows her job! I am getting into reading it now and get my PDE material ready when the times comes.
1,Not happy,I own a 2005 Mustang GT and wanted a Hurst White Ball to go with my Hurst Short Throw Shifter. Well Amazon said this would be the one but sadly it didn't even come close to fitting.
4,"An obviously talented writer, and excellent expose'","Having a similar background, I feel Ms. Moran has done an excellent job in describing her 5 years as a Case Officer with the CIA. Her use of humor and honesty add to the books message about what the CIA is really like. I would love to read more of her works, be it about the CIA, or whatever."
3,Ok in essence but the author was severely lacking in character,"I enjoyed much of the first half of the book because it seemed fairly accurate (though overly dramatized). However, the protagonist was incredibly whiny and critical of literally everything in her path that the book became more annoying than interesting/informative. Those who are interested in the CIA/working at the CIA should read the first half, even three quarters of the book. The rest can either be disregarded or speed read."
3,"A liberal ""thinker"" in the CIA","While the description of her training is insightful, it is hard to stomach the author's ""I'm college educated and better than you"" attitude. However, she does manage to be funny and the style of writing is enjoyable."
3,Not what I was looking for,"This is a slightly different version of the story. It is done well, but I was looking for the Broadway version."
2,Does not work properly on ds,"I got this primarily for the backgammon feature. However, I cannot get the doubling feature to work on the DS (it does have a game boy advance cartridge slot). The right button works on other games but not this one. Without doubling, backgammon is no fun."
5,"Excellent... how-to deadhead, shear, etc.","We need more! When to pinch, deadhead, etc. So far this is the BEST perennial 'primer' I have found. There are so many perennials....what to do, when! I found a review in the Portland, Oregon 'Oregonian' and promptly ordered. I have not been disappointed and use this book as a reference."
4,Much Better then the PlayStation version (except...),"I first played Rayman 2 on the PlayStation. I loved the game, the voice acting most of all. When I bought my Dreamcast, I bought Rayman 2 for it. I love the Dreamcast version even better. The graphics are absolutly fantastic, as is the music. The only problem I have with it is that the Dreamcast version doesn't have the voice acting. Instead it has everybody talking some gibberish language. This was a big let down, and it's the only thing that's preventing me from giving it 5 stars. However, it's not enough to make me suggest not buying it. You'll have a pretty tough time getting everything in the game, so it will make you come back for more. If you're a fan of adventure games, you really should take a look at Rayman 2 (Dreamcast or PlayStation). I can't wait untill Ubi Soft puts Rayman 3 out on GameCube!"
1,Interesting premise,"Too bad the author could not live up to his plot outline. I read with interest the review written by a 'reader from Florida' that proposes readers that do not like this book are gay, anti-gun liberals. I am none of those things, in fact, I cannot wait until deer season each year in this part of the country, and I have read nearly anything 'good' that falls into this genre; i.e. any Tom Clancy novel, any Stephen Hunter novel (the 'Bob the Nailer' series in particular), but I can find nothing in this authors vision that would prompt me to pick up another of his books. The action is simplistic, the reparte is juvenile, the set-ups are transparent, and the justification for the use of violence seem to be an NRA-sanctioned advertisement. I can only hope that the writer will not find a big audience for this type of book."
4,A fast-moving novel that I couldn't put down.,"A great guy book with lots of action and enjoyable plot. The writing style hits hard and straight to the point. I imagine readers will either lover or hate this book. After reading a business book, Jimmy Buffet's latest and a Lewis & Clark book this summer, this book was the perfect break from my normal fare. Just plain fun."
2,Not Up To What It Claims.,"All I wanted was something to help me understand what was happening and why my computer was acting the way it did sometimes. Had more troubles after I put the programs on the computer.Even the Uninstaller didn't do a complete job. On the first restart (and several afterward) after the so called 'Uninstall', I had 'Program Path Unknown Error' until I reinstalled the programs. I had to reformat my hard drive to get rid of the problem."
5,But No Elephants,My sister in-law gave this book to my 2 year old daughter 3 months ago and she wants it read to her every single day. She wants to take it with her everywhere. She loves this book!!! I love it. This book should not be out of print!
2,I could not read this book,"As you can see from the above title, I did not read this book. I borrowed it from the library and managed to get through but 30 pages. After having read ""Awareness Through Movement,"" I thought it might be rewarding to see what one of his practitioners thought about his concepts. This book may appeal to some, but I found it far too verbose and provincial for my taste. For example, Ms. Alon's table of contents lists every single paragraph (I am not exaggerating) thoughout the entire book. Thus, if one wants to capture the import of a chapter, one must read through dozens of descriptions. Equally notable is the contrast in style from Feldenkrais. Having read his ""Awareness Through Movement,"" I was struck by his economy of language, almost to the point of terseness. I sought something more conversational, but Ms. Alon's book was a surprise. Again, others may find her style rewarding. I did not."
5,Nice quality,This is a nice quality piece. Heavy tray with gold accents gives it an expensive look. It was packed carefully to ensure against breakage.
3,Needs more room for installation than stated dimensions,"The drawer actually requires an extra inch-and-a-half or so in width because of how the installation hardware is set up. For this reason, I had to send it back because my desk is small. But it looked like a nice, sturdy, drawer."
2,Too small for my keyboard!,Just bought and installed it today...installation was easy and product seems nice except it's TOO SMALL for my MS Wireless desktop 5000 keyboard. Ugh. Who would've thought?Check the measurements before you buy it...
4,keyboard drawer,"It's not the greatest keyboard drawer, but it's definitely not the worst. My desk is 32 inches off the floor, so it's a little taller than average, so even with my chair up all the way, I feel like I should be just a little taller so that my palms would rest better on the palm rest. It was easy install, but I wish there were more than 2 height screw options(for a shorter desk this wouldn't be a problem). I'm 5'4 with a short torso, so I don't sit high up as it is. BUt it slides fine and smooth overall, it is rather large, so if you're putting in a confined desk with drawers on each side, then you may run into problems with opening the mouse slide out. My space is about 28 1/4 inches and that leaves room for a mouse to maneuvar. If the space wasn't this wide then I wouldn't be able to pull the mouse slide out very much to make it worth my while to use. So I got lucky that I had an already large space to place it in."
4,It works (for the most part)!,"When I measured the desk, I thought this would fit. However, I did not take into consideration how the desk was shaped (it is a corner desk) and so once installed, I was unable to use the mouse tray. Otherwise, the product is ok. It serves the need and installed fairly easily. I am satisfied."
3,Fellowes Keyboard Drawer,"I bought the Fellowes keyboard drawer to use a wireless keyboard with my laptop at my home-made work table. The price was right. It was easy to install and adjust, especially since I turned the tabletop upside down to install it--no crawling under or drilling overhead. The mouse holder works fine. But, I had to remove the keyboard stop at the rear to fit my Logitech cordless keyboard. It would have been helpful to have had the usable tray dimensions listed, and the product could be improved by making the keyboard stop more adjustable for today's deeper keyboards."
3,Description,The product was OK but did not fit under my desk and the directions were very good. I would have been very happy if it fit!
5,"Sturdy, simple, does what it is meant to do",Using the template that shipped with the board I was able to easily mark and drill the holes properly into my desk. I needed this for the keyboard I had connected to a KVM as I hated the clutter and trying to switch boards on my desktop. Now I just slide it out when I want to check or change the configuration of the server. Locks into place where its supposed to. The drawer and the mouse platform slide out easily and are quite sturdy. I'd spring for the swing arm version but I didn't see the need at this time.
4,Great product for great price,"This product was extremely easy to install. It took approximately 5 minutes. It is sturdy and comfortable. The mouse tray slides back under the keyboard tray, which is convenient. The keyboard tray is comfortable and an added bonus is that you can adjust the height of the tray when installing. All you need during the installation process is a power drill with a small drill bit and screw driver. The tray stays in place instead of rolling back and forth on its own like some others do. The black version I have matches perfectly with my black desk. I highly recommend this product over the more expensive ones."
1,Flawed design,"Ok. After trying to install this for two hours now, I am so frustrated that I am returning the product. First of all. the template used to drill the holes under your desk is 1/2 inch too short on all sides, so I had to drill four more holes under the desk. Secondly, where it said to install caused it to stick out too much from the front of my desk. My chair kept knocking it when i pushed it in, bending the brackets back. And then I had to break off the little plastic tab that holds the keyboard in place because it was too short for my Logitech keyboard, and the edge of my keyboard rested on top of it, making it wobbly when typing. The mouse pad that pulls out is way too small. Overall a crappy product."
1,Piece of Junk,This thing is so poorly made I couldn't open it. Once I forced it open I couldn't get it to close again. Save your money.
2,Difficult to use.,It takes too long to unscrew the tiny thing and refitting the two pieces takes too much time. I'd prefer throwing my tea in cup and straining to using this item.
1,Very Cheaply Made,I bought this tea ball because I left my other one at home when I left for college. I noticed as soon as it came that it was very difficult to take apart and put together because the lid and base were virtually the same size. The first time putting tea in it i struggled to get it together and the tea went flying. After 3 uses the ball got stuck together. Trying to open it I sliced my finger open on the sharp metal lip. I would just make the investment to buy something a bit nicer than this or you will regret it too.
3,Could be better...,"This tea ball infuser is somewhat difficult to open and close. The 2 stainless steel pieces don't fit together perfectly. It works with a little trouble, and the price was right, but I try to avoic using it."
1,Stay away - harder than rubik's cube,"This tea strainer is for those who like a challenge, have tools, doesn't mind bleeding, and has great motor skill and spare times. I used this once and the thing was very hard to open. I used a small screwdriver, jabing my hands, causing bleeding, to pryed it open. I managed to get it stuck togather while trying to reattach the chain. Try something else, unless want to buy this for someone who has a odd sense of humor."
2,Bad Tea Ball!,"This tea infuser does not work with smaller pieces, as in the Teavana Rooibos Chai + Mate blend. All the grit just made its way out of the ball.Also, it's not totally easy to get the two halves back together again, though it is possible.I'd leave this tea ball for larger loose-leaf teas, and for when you're not in a hurry!"
3,holes are too big,"While it does it's job, the holes are too big and a lot of the tea gets through the holes. I would say this is more for whole loose leaf rather than crushed loose leaf tea."
1,Poorly Designed,"Don't waste your money on this product. It's difficult to get the top on and off to get the tea in, and the chain broke after two uses for me."
3,"Great translations, NO MUSIC . . . .","I recently purchased SpyHunter/Super Sprint for the Gameboy Advance. While the cart is a pretty true-to-form translation of the arcade versions of these classics, one minor fault fells its ability to shine as a game: namely, there is NO MUSIC, save for the intro. screen.For those from my generation who have played the SpyHunter arcade classic, they know that one of the key elements of the game was the ""Peter Gunn"" theme song playing under the game as you manuvered the streets, hunting down bullet-proof cars, tire-slashing roadsters and hit-man limos. Unfortunately, there is no music on this cart and it suffers greatly for it. Gone is the feel of the arcade game's charm and the player is left only with a shell of the game's former self.Too bad Bally Midway didn't have the fortitude to include one of the most vital element's of the game: the music. And so the search for a true translation of SpyHunter from the arcade days goes on . . . ."
1,"Cool concept, horrible dependability","I received this watch as a gift after my other watch's battery died. The Eco-Drive is a neat concept, but this is a horrible watch. Right from the beginning it had issues. The upper right dial stayed between tick marks. I know there is a calibration procedure for adjusting it by whole tick marks, but not for adjusting it within tick marks. I sent it away to Citizen and it came back just a broke. We ended up exchanging the watch for a different one with the upper right dial correctly in place. A month ago, the second hand stopped moving. I figured it was low on charge so I set it out in the sun for an afternoon with no resolve. After having it in the sun for a week it still doesn't work. I guess it must be sent off for service again. I even tried the reset procedure, but I have had no luck. I will never buy a citizen again."
3,Overall a great resource,"This is a great recipe book for those a little intimidated by feeding their new eater but also wanting food to be wholesome, nutritious, adventuresome, and fun. The recipes have made me think of new combinations or add a little spice here and there that I might not have otherwise. The only shortcoming is mixing some of the one year old recipes with those of 9 months up to 1 year, which means the recipes with milk (and eggs depending upon your pediatrician's advice) might not really be suitable for a while longer. It's a bit confusing and limits your options in that age range. I am definitely ready to introduce more things to my daughter within her current repertoire and need a few more hints for the next couple of months. I'll check around elsewhere for those, but this is a great book to have on hand nonetheless."
5,"Raising a future ""foodie""","I've had a chance to make zucchini and butternut squash purees for my 6 month-old and so far so good! I like that the recipies give you an option for how to cook each recipie, for example, you can either steam or microwave zucchini. Also, you can use a blender or food processer for most dishes. The book also gives really clear instructions for saving food for later. I put the squash in ice cube trays; it is so easy to pop a ""cube"" into the microwave. If you have an automatic ice maker and don't have any ice cube trays on hand, I highly recommend buying silicone trays. You can even buy pink ones from Sur La Table (www.surlatable.com). Cubes come out cleanly with no fragments left in the tray. Get this cookbook if you want a little work on the weekend with the rest of the week as easy as opening a jar! The only down side I can think of is she is not as explicit about foods to avoid because of allergies or nitrates (spinach, carrots, etc.) on the recipe pages."
1,You don't need this to cook for your baby,"If you are new to cooking this may be worthwhile. Otherwise you are wasting your money on ""recipes"" for pureeing single foods (seriously, she calls those recipes) and poorly researched advice on diet for children. You can easily puree foods on your own for the few months your child is eating them and by the time they are ready for more, you can teach yourself how to modify what you are eating to share with them. This book perpetuates the fear about feeding our own children, that somehow we have to have another person's advice to feel confident about our choices. Any child reference book, like Dr. Sears baby's book, will have a basic list of foods to avoid and that's all you really need."
5,"Great for baby, excellent for children!",The book starts out with explanations of organic versus non. Then into baby recipes and finally ones for toddlers. Great uses of a large variety of fruits and vegetables. A must have for your bookshelf!
2,Its a history book...,"I glanced at this book, it seems like a history book. It does talk about some postitions, but i suppose anyone could have figured out the ones it talks about. In my opinion Ultimate Gay Sex is a better book. Not only does UGS talk about postions (and leaves out the history... yuck!) UGS talks about relationsips, positons, protection, and contracted deasises and their symptoms.... hope this helps!"
4,gift not used yet,"This seems like an interesting read, but the recipient of this gift has not used the knowledge learned yet. Hopefully soon it will be used."
2,Deadly Visions,This book was ok. Not sure I would read any other novels. I have my favorites and I read him just to try it.
5,"""Talented All-American Writer Found!""","A friend of mine sent this book to me for my birthday, she knows I love a good mystery.Well, I loved this book! I couldn't put it down, read it over the weekend. The book is so well-written, you can tell the author is sophisticated, cultured, romantic, sexy and all-american. It was funny because as soon as I started reading it, I felt like I was watching one of those old black&white; mysteries from the 40's on a rainy Sunday.I appreciated the snappy conversations and the slow-paced suspense that kept me evenly electrified!I now want to read everything William Bayer has written."
3,Directors Cut Ruins the Film,"I bought this film unaware that it was the directors cut. I still have the original release on VHS tape and I thought I could upgrade to DVD. I started to watch the DVD and felt that the film was rushed and was missing some important parts. I then realized it was the Directors Cut, and that is why it was shorter and missing scenes! After finding this out I stopped the DVD and put the VHS in. I didn't want to miss out on anything and I wanted the full experience I had as a child. I will continue to use the VHS and will not put the DVD back in, as there was NO NEED TO CUT THE SCENES. Even though they are in the Bonus Features, its not the same when they aren't part of the movie."
5,This is a part of my childhood right here,"I grew up with Gumby, so the Gumby movie will always hold a special place in my heart. To this very day I still enjoy Gumby. I might be completely biased, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,A little bit weird,"I used to watch Gumby when I was a kid, and I bought this for my 3 year old. I found it a bit weird watching it now, as an adult. I wouldn't call it quality television. Sorry Gumby lovers!"
3,The '79 Season. Not the '77.,"The reviewers saying that these episodes are from the 1977-78 season of The Superfriends are wrong. This DVD release is a compilation of episodes from the 1979 season ""The World's Greatest Super Friends"". It should be noted that this release does NOT contain every episode from that season. It only has 16 of the 23 episodes. Why they did not include the entire season is anyone's guess. If you doubt what I say, go to the ""Superman Homepage"" and check for yourself. Whatever you do, don't listen to these turkeys. They have no clue what they're talking about."
3,"What about the original series with Wendy, Marvin, and Wonderdog?","This is a nice to have but it would be really Really nice if they would put out the ORIGINAL episodes featuring Wendy, Marvin, and Wonderdog - and INCLUDE WITHIN THOSE the little ""helpful tips"" footage, the intermission style shorts, as they were originally broadcast."
3,"Murder in Suburbia, won't make a killing","The script is okay..but the delivery is terrible. Catz is unconvincing as a hardened DI, and her partner is more like a little sister who is tagging along than she is a DS. The sexual tension between Catz character and her boss doesn't work. They just can't pull it off...it's almost embarrassing to watch as it is done so poorly. I hope Season 2 is better and everyone is settled into their roles."
2,dull suburbanites are at it again,"Good to watch on a lazy summer afternoon, a bit on the dull side, the police women seem to be the only ones with a pulse. If folks living in the British suburbs are as self-cenetered as portrayed, I say let them kill each other and clean out the gene pool."
5,Love This!,"This workout is so much fun, and she really gives you a great workout. She incorporates weights and brings up heart rate with a little bit of kickboxing moves and other simple cardio moves. Very easy to follow as are all her workouts, and she always explains how to modify moves if needed. I love this workout!!"
5,love it,"I have been taking it for 4 weeks and I see a big difference. My legs don't swell up anymore when the weather is hot and the almost black big spots with spider veins on my feet diminished and lightened up that they are barely visible anymore. I clearly see that it helps with lymph drainage, since my legs look noticeably thinner. I do not see that much difference in the spider veins higher up the leg, yet."
1,i just don't think it works,"i bought this product because i suffer from varicose veins/poor leg circulation. i've been taking the supplement for a few months now, and i am not noticing any improvement in my legs or in the appearance of veins. will not be purchasing again."
4,Educational and edifying ....,"This is a great resource for bringing more balance into your life. The book describes six ways of meeting God - Holiness, Charismatic, Contemplative, Social Justice, Incarnational, and Evangelical - and sometimes these words don't mean what you think they mean. The authors encourage the reader to broaden their relationship with and vision of God, and for me, I was able to see God working more powerfully, and in many more ways, than before."
2,Not very reliable,"I honestly did not find anything helpful with this book. It was a true disappointment. I went to the places mentioned in the book that were ""supposedly"" dog friendly..And more than half were not, which was embarassing for me and my dog..Reference books are suppose to give facts not misinformation..I want my money back!!"
5,This book gives you a chance to understand yourself.,This is a very well written book. It is a must for every one who wants to understand himself and the fellow people around him. This book allows you to understand your ego states. This book helps you to find answers for mind boggling questions like who am I? What am I? Why am I doing this? And things like that. This book helps you to judge if you are a winner or a looser. This book aids you with the tools which may come in handy to improve your life and you becomming a winner.
3,Self Help,This book was very enlightening to say the least. It is not the easiest book to read in that it is disturbing. It brings to light the fact that none of us are singular in the world of emotional pain.
1,very disappointed with Sony,"I first want to say, I love dealing with amazon, their customer service is excellent, and I have always loved Sony products. This surround system does not work well. The sound is absolutely great if you can get the main unit dvd player to function. I've had it hooked up for three weeks and have had several problems. First, the volume wouldn't increase or decrease, then the dvd player would freeze up and shut down automatically while playing a movie, now I have two discs in there and it won't eject them. Sony help says there is a malfunction in the unit and I now have to take it for repair to get my stuff out. I don't want another malfunctioning unit, I'm returning this as fast as I can. This Sony product is not worth the money or aggravation."
4,Working Well,"Installed it in my garage wall for the dogs to get in and out into their fenced-in yard, and it's fine for that application, but it's just a sheet of hinged hard plastic, no insulation value or anything, so I wouldn't recommend putting this in a residence if you're worried about heat or cold air escaping.You would have to install this thing to some pretty close tolerances to get the lock mechanisms to work -- mine is in a concrete block wall and those knobs are too big to fit. I just use a small concrete block if I want to keep animals out when we're not around. As far as keeping out burglars, well, I leave that up to the dogs. A hole as big as that, with a thin sheet of plastic blocking it is not going to stop anyone from getting in, locked or not."
1,Don'y buy!,"This company sucks! Don't buy from them. The BP cuff's needle was not working properly when I recieved it in the mail. I called the company for them to fix it and they wanted me to pay to have it shipped to them, PLUS $5.00 so they could ship it back to me! I received it broke, why should I have to pay for that? BEWARE!"
2,Good design but flimsy material,"I have had this stand for about a year now. The height and adjustability are perfect. But the plastic material is flimsy, and it didn't take long for the little plastic pieces in the back that hold the stand in its desired position to break. So I've been using it with major tape slapped across the back of the stand to keep it from collapsing (which it still periodically does). I am now shopping for a new stand, one preferably made of aluminum."
4,Justice Subdued,"Wilson changed publishers, so he had to change the way his books were named-- though a good title for this one might have been Justice Subdued.Benjamin is on Prozac, recovering from the trauma he went through in Blind Eye, and so the book just didn't have the impact the others had, until very late in the game, when he dumps his Prozac down the toilet and gets more in touch with his feelings. Still a great book and highly recommended, though in my opinion not as strong as the five that preceded it.Neil Plakcy, author ofMahu Surfer: A Hawaiian Mystery (An Alyson Mystery)"
5,GREAT!,"My kids just LOVE Clifford VERY MUCH! Very EDUCATIONAL and teaches kids soo much. My boys share, they love animals and to be very considerate of others and CLIFFORD helps teach them soo much."
4,Thought-provoking,"...or perhaps more to the point, imagination provoking. This book somehow seems to open up your peripheral vision. It gets a bit bogged down sometimes - skim those parts, but well worth reading!"
4,Something to consider,"An interesting discussion regarding the egocentric modern world. Abram makes reference to a myriad of unconsciously driven facets of human existence, now either ignored or forgotten. Although he limits his argument to the issue of language, his overall thesis is certainly something to consider and apply."
2,Disappointed,"Hum.. So I am new to this.. but here u go.In September I visited a local store to see about a camera. I was shown the Cybershot by a friend ( who worked there ) that happened to be a display. It was never used and I got it for $350. I thought what a deal. WRONG.I liked it for the first month, but noticed that not all the pictures were clear. In fact, the further away the subject, the more blurrier it got. I played with the camera and tried all settings. Even tried resetting it after reading a review on here. It did not help. In certain lighting the pictures came out yellow, and unfocused. I am a store manager that just had a major event with Santa and took many pictures with it that just did not come out good enough for the kids.I finally just took it back. There were things I liked.. like the viewing screen and movie with sound. Yet... I want pictures that are clear.. and this just did not do it for me."
3,cannot use this camera to its advantage as per the manual,could someone help me to obtain the best results as I am very unimpressed at this time. The manual is not helping me. I know that I am a very bad camera user so maybe this is not as friendly as they tell me. Have seen some great outdoor pictures but not mine. Leon PLEASE IF SOMEONE HAS THE TIME FOR AN OLDEN PLEASE TELEPHONE ME 020 8977 2125 and ask for LEON.
1,Not good enough!,"Yes, I read the manual.Yes, I tried all of the optional settings.Yes, I gave this camera more than a fair chance to prove its worth.Bottom line: All of the problems that are in the other reviews are a reality, folks. The photos that this camera takes are simply not good enough.In my opinion, there are a lot of people out there that are taking a lot of crappy photos who either don't care or don't know the difference. This camera is apparently great for that type of person.If YOU care about the pictures you take, don't buy this camera."
1,Waste of money,"I give it a 1/2 star, 1 is too muchI have owned this camera for more than a year now, and this is my second review, after reading all the comments that were made, I tried a few other techiques like resetting and changing settings but still no luck.This camera is great for someone who sometimes wants half descent pictures taken outdoors(indoors forget about it, you can't get them). And even the ones taken outdoors are not good sometime, Itried holding it staedy and everything else.I wish I never bought the camera, I could get better pictures with a $50.00 non-didgital camera.Maybe the other people talking good about this camera just got lucky and got a better camera than us.It is a good looking camera and that's all I can say about it."
1,Form over Function,I wanted to like this camera. It is beautiful and compact with a generous display. However I could not get any clear blur-free indoor pictures. I read that you can fiddle with manual mode adjustments to improve this but I expected better for a point and shoot. I then purchased a Canon S500 (a little more bulk but a very nice form factor) and have since sold the Sony DSCT1. I am very pleased with Canon.
4,Good read,"This is a pleasing, quick read. The author has a good humorous (but factual) approach to the apocalypse. I would also suggest Forest Griffin's book about the ApocalypseBe Ready When the Sh*t Goes Down: A Survival Guide to the Apocalypse"
5,Great find!,"Loved this book! I got this book at random without knowing anything about the author or most of the things that were discussed in the book. I just finished it and plan to read it again at some point. Since finishing the book, it prompted me to check out Sonia's website and I plan to read more of her books. I'd love to be able to afford a personal consultation with her one day! I've even shared her words to my husband, along with talking about her book to friends as well. If you are interested in creating a positive path in life and being more aware of yourself and the people you surround yourself with, read this book."
2,"A Couple is missing here, MULDER AND SCULLY!!! (x-files)","WHAT A JOKE!!!! ITS LIKE A BONUS CHAPTER OF THE XFILES..WIHTOUT DAVID D. AND GILLIAN ANDERSON,Im A huge fan of the x-files and this movie, is just an extension of plots of the tv show... Its a shame for chris carter, and in the special features... the making of .. what a bunch of Liars, nobody admit the similitude with the X files.. (On special the Writter)A poor and bad Movie... !Zero! originality...... (but the suction effect was very funny)"
3,Builds up to nothing,"Julianne Moore is great, as always, in ""The Forgotten"", a sci-fi thriller in which those around her simply seem to believe that her dead nine year old son never existed. Some twists and turns and interesting action comprises about the first two thirds of the film, leading me to want more and figure out what exactly was going on. Let's just say the ending is very disappointing and extremely simplistic. Once again, a film suffers from a lackluster script. Without Moore this film would be below average, but she lifts it to watchable status."
3,Like an X-Files Episode,"The Forogotten certainly had the potential to be a great movie, but it is just weighted down by a B-Movie plot about (**SPOILER**) alien experiments on parents. The best thing about the movie is Julianne Moore's wonderful performance as a mother who refuses to forget the son everyone tells her never existed. In the end, it's that mother's love, that fetal link between mother and child, that is ultimately the undoing of the alien experiment. Because of that, the movie is certainly worth viewing. If you have the opportunity, watch both the theatrical version and the extended alternate ending. In my opinion, the theatrical ending is the much better of the two. The alternate ending is just too X-Files for my tastes."
4,Good Thriller,"Despite the fact that I really do not like Julianne Moore (I know she's a good actress I just don't like her, so sue me) I really enjoyed this movie. There are the shocker scenes that leave you breathless, the unusual and yet somehow predictable plot, likeable characters, and a great setting. Overall a very watchable, entertaining movie despite some plot-holes and gaps in logic that can often be found in sci-fi stuff. The attempts at tugging at your heartstrings were somehow lost on me and just didn't affect me like the writer/director/actors wanted it to because of something missing. Still I was intruiged and I completely enjoyed myself."
4,A film that is not to be forgotten. Ha ha ha! Ahem.,"The plot of this film was fairly original I would say, and the progression of interesting events included was easy to gain an interest in. The Forgotten tells the tale of a woman whose son supposedly died in a plane crash, who suddenly begins to find all of the evidence that she ever had a son being erased before her very eyes. After teaming up with another man who had lost a child to the plane crash, she begins an escapade to find out what has truly happened to their children (the way all ends up I shall not tell!). Intensity is presented in many sections of the movie, such as when the two main characters have a CIA agent in their custody and behold as he is yanked by an unseen force up through the roof and away into the sky above. There wasn't much to say negatively about this movie, maybe just that not quite enough happened to satiate; but I would still give four stars to this film."
3,Disappointment,"The first part of this movie is very intriguing. As time goes forward Julianne Moore's son first disappears from photos, then from her husband and friend's memories. You really start to wonder if her psychiatrist is right and she's made the boy's existence up altogether. Then NSA agents show up and I was really confused and even more interested. Unfortunately from there on, the movie cops out. When I found out what was going on, I deflated like a balloon. Aliens running experiments? Gee, haven't seen that before in movies, tv shows, novels, short stories, etc. It seems like the writer came up with the idea for the first part of the movie and then didn't know how to end it and what he came up with is neither original nor good."
4,Movie & Soundtrack Are Superb,"Excellent cast with strong performances by Moore, West, Roache, and Woodard. Suspense & the unexpected combine to keep viewers on edge. Upbeat ending. Although not a big fan of such films, I consider this to be one of the best I've seen in a long time. If some scenes don't literally jolt you, check your pulse! I LOVE the soundtrack -- bought it and listen to it often. I highly recommend it too."
2,Great Plot that Kind of Gets Bizarre,"Twilight zone meets A Beautiful Mind. Explores the psychic connection that some mothers have with their children. Glad to see that the ""mother bear"" archetype is alive and well but the plot makes a shaky transition from psychodrama to Twilight Zone/Psi Factor/X-Files. Julianne Moore is superb but the writing doesn't make the connections between the parallel realities."
5,SIMILAR TO THE SIXTH SENSE,"Julianne Moore is a mother in mourning the death of her 9-year-old, Sam. Unable to focus on reality, her mind is blown when she is informed by her therapist (Gary Sinise) and her husband (Anthony Edwards) that Sam never existed. Refusing to accept such an explanation, she goes off on her own to investigate what happened to her son. 'The Forgotten' is aided by good performances and a creepy tone."
1,Could have been Better ***SPOILERS***,"The movie starts of pretty good but goes downhill ater the movie turns from a physcotic thriller, to a ripped of X-Files episode with car chases and special effects.The story has a lot of plot holes like, the alien seem to have power to erase the videos and photos and even erase memories, but covers a wall with ""wallpapers""? The experiment is so absurd and the movie does not explain most of the stuff. The movie could give more info instead of the flashbacks and Moore running.I would recommend watching X-Files or other Sci-Fi instead of this movie."
3,??????????,"When I watching this movie, I was like this is a pretty good movie! But towards the end my thoughts changed. I thought it was so messed up and it didn't make sense. I guess that is the way the way the movie was suppose to be. This movie was ok, at least it killed few hours on a rainy day."
1,Awful movie,"I can forgive the implausibility of the premise, the stupidity of the characters (especially the alien), how the 'right' person just happens to be there at just the right time. What I can't forgive is how the screenplay cheats the audience by tacking on a ridiculous X-Files ending that is supposed to wrap everything up oh-so-nicely. This is taking the easy way out, applying an entirely non-creative solution to a puzzle that cried out for some imagination.I feel cheated out of two hours that could've been spent watching something so much better. If you're a Julianne Moore fan, she has much better films than this!"
5,Forgetting a son in the name of national security,"In The Forgotten, national security agents and mysteriously powerful forces conducting sociological experiments somehow engineer people to forget their children. The children disappear on a plane taking them to a camp, and this plane, we discover, is an instrument of the national security agents and mysteriously powerful forces.We never learn who the mysterious forces are, precisely, but we can believe them to be extraterrestrial. The film permits this otherwordly interpretation and encourages the interpretation literally, but art is metaphorical, and I don't much believe in extraterrestrials conducting experiments myself. I suspect the filmmakers don't either, really.The word ""abduct"" descends from Latin meaning ""to lead away"". It's funny that Telly uses the word ""abduct"". Most people would say ""kidnap"", but Sam's mother perceives leaders engineering her to forget a son they've led away."
2,Sadly I thought we were past this...,"... time when movies about a mother's love for her son is sacrosanct. I think what rubs me the most is that the father in this movie forgets his daughter only to be reminded of her by Moore's character. I find the subtext of this disturbing.This is a not-so-veiled misandrous film of giant proportions and rates up there with 'Enough' with Jennifer Lopez and the truly awful 'Panic Room' with Jodie Foster not to mention 'Unfaithful' with Richard Gere.I don't know when this treasured narrative will dared to be rewritten and filmed showing that evil can be and is visited upon the innocent by both sexes, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives. I hope it is soon."
2,Fuggettaboutit,"I really think the director is trying to channel Stanley Kubric. The pacing is so akward and drawn out that you just loose interest. Let's get to the point - you just don't care about the characters. Seriously. You just can't suspend disbelief if you can't believe in the characters. That's the movie's major flaw, and it's a mighty big one."
1,Broken already,"I am a hobbyist and bought this machine in July 2012. I've used the item only a handful of times, certainly totaling less than 10 minutes of run time. The bearing at the cutter end of the motor is already broken making the machine very loud and allowing the cutter shaft to wobble. Poor product quality."
5,Bosch Colt Router,"One of the best innovations in the shop! I use it for chamfering, rounding over, beading and other operations in a cabinet shop. I have gotten a lot of use out of it. It is much easier to use than a regular size router. The only gripe is that it is hard to engage the lock for the single-wrench collet. It runs smoothely and the adjustments are nicer than others on the market. The finger grips are a nice tough too. I have a few Bosch tools, and this router is one more reason why that number keeps growing.Brent"
4,it's fine overall,"The collet lock that everyone talks about - it's fine, but only if you use it properly. Do it several times with the router unplugged, before you use it. You really need to follow the instructions, otherwise it won't work. Once you learn the procedure, it's fine.Other than that, it works okay. It's a small router, so you won't be cutting barn doors with it. But seems to have plenty of power for its size. Also, it's easy to use at weird angles and in tight places, again due to its small size."
4,A high-performing router,"I bought this to work on a kitchen cabinet project, and it has performed as well as I expected after reading all the reviews. My only complaint is the need for two wrenches for installing the router bits. By now, I would think, Bosch would have come up with a tool-less system for installing router bits."
1,Bosch PR20EVSK Colt Palm Grip 5.6 Amp 1-Horsepower Fixed-Base Variable-Speed Router with Edge Guide,"I have been dissapointed with this router. It is not ""user friendly"" at all for the non=professional weekend woodworker. The main problem I have had with it is keeping it locked in position. The locking mechanizm is very easily dissengaged making the entire tool rotate and drop down into the work piece with disastrious results. It is also very difficult to adjust up and down. I would not reccommend this tool for the average non-professional woodworker."
3,let me save you some frustration,Ok this router is great ther are acouple of design problems . The first is thers only one wrench that comes with this router the first thing you should do is throw it away and buy a small crestent . the wrench they inclide doesnt fit well . Second when you remove the bit the you push the locking button it will not lock you need to push it in at the very bottem of the switch or it wont lock it will push up and out and you will get pissed and say bad words and every budy will laugh at you . Next there is a switch problem if you are using it on alot of mdf all the dust will not let the switch work right so every so often blow out the router and you wont have any more problems . great router but it does need a little redesign . You will love this thing once you learn all the little problems
5,A Good Match,"I am using this router on a Shark CNC Pro and it gets 4 to 6 hours of off and on use daily. So far has performed without a problem. Time will tell how long this can go on, but so far I am impressed.."
4,Brainless and Entertaining,"Dave Gorman is a guy who spends many months and a bunch of money traveling around the world to find other people named Dave Gorman. The concept itself is funny enough, but Dave's writing style (I think he was formerly a radio personality) adds even more to the fun. There is an insert with photos of him with each Dave Gorman he met along the way (including a couple honorary Dave Gormans). An incredibly entertaining read for no good reason --perfect for a weekend afternoon."
4,great knife,"This is a great lil knife. My son worked at a sports store where I first saw it. I liked it and so I bought one (with his employee discount ... Lol) I carried it for almost a year. Then I lost it. I found it again after almost 2 months at the bottom of my wood pile. It looked and operated the same as the last time as I used it. I have since lost it again and instead of looking all over Gods creation for it, I ordered another one........It came with a razor sharp edge and holds it very well. It feels well in my hand. This is a fine knife for under $40 (well, that's what I bought it for) I can hardly wait to have one in my pocket again...."
5,A great Knife...,"The knife is sleek and has a great profile. I love the speedsafe function on it. The blade lock is a bit stiff, but I suppose that's just so it doesn't slide open on accident."
5,Awesome knife,"I just bought two more of these knives, these guys keep loosing them! One even cried he likes the knife so much,(grown men shouldn't cry over the loss of a knife, but I must say I would shed a tear if I lost my kershaw). It's very well made, and every kershaw I've ever owned has been. We have all put these knives through hell, and the blade still looks new. Holds the edge on it very well, needing only weekly sharpening with heavy use. The spring assist works great, as fast as any switchblade. So here I am, back buying more for them, they wanted the same exact one and are lost without it! Great buy for the price too! Cheaper than Wal Mart plus free standard shipping."
4,Good blade and opening mechanism,This Kershaw knife has been a fun one to test out and work with. To start with the blade is very good and holds an edge well. The serrated section is easy to sharpen as well and gave me no issues. Overall this is a great knife but I would give a word of caution to people who are clumsy. The flicking mechanism does work very well but the slick sides of the knife also means that its easy to drop or have your finger slide into the blade. Just be careful if working in wet or oily conditions.
5,Well Made Knife,"This knife is a nice size for EDC, not for heavy duty use, a bit hard to open using the thumb stud though. I like it, tell everybody that sees it, Made in the USA. Try to support products that are made here and this is a good one."
5,My favorite,Good price...excellent knife... what can I say... it's a keeper! Thanks Kershaw! If I had it to do again... I'd make the same purchase again!
3,Six Months,"I've been carrying this knife daily and using it several times a week. I haven't yet had to sharpen it and the knife still opens briskly. There is no visible wear, definitely a good buy.Edit: After some thought, and using the knife under adverse conditions, I'm going to lower my to review to three stars. The lack of any sort of texturing makes it very difficult to use when wearing gloves or with wet hands.Further Update: I lost one of the washers while cleaning the knife. Kershaw had two replacement pairs to me within two days, Great Service!"
3,not rugged enough,"this knife is an amazingly sharp knife and it is made well.... but it is not rugged, its too thin and brittle to use as a all purpose outdoors knife. this is sharp and precise knife but not tough, it will break if you try to put longitudinal stress on it"
4,Four stars for good customer service...,"When I received my Kershaw Leek I was really unhappy to find that it had a flaw on the flipper. The gimping was cut too deeply near the tip and it was almost cut completely through the flipper. It was still useable, but it should not have made it through Kershaw's QA/QC. My initial assumption was that the knife was a second or a reject, which might have explained why the knife came without a box or documents from Kershaw, but that guess was incorrect. It was simply a flawed knife that just slipped through the cracks - it happens...Thankfully, the vendor Starr Self-Reliance, LLC refunded me the full amount of my purchase without having to be hassled or even prompted. Kudos to them! I am disappointed in the flawed knife, but impressed by the customer service!"
3,"Kershaw Speedsafe, SS beauty, great price, but still decided to return",I love Kershaw and I loved how this Leek SS looked but I ended it up returning it. The framelock was hard to unlock especially with one hand. Maybe it was supposed to be this way to make sure the blade was locked solid when open. Someone metioned that this allows them to be made thinner that the linerlock variety. I prefer the other cheaper Kershaws with linerlocks which are easier to handle
