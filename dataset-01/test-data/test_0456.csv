5,Omron scale,"This is the first scale my family has ever owner. The weght measurements are exact, no change when weighing in multiple times within 5 minutes. Great purchase for the money. My kids love it."
4,maybe as good as they get,"The weight measurement seems to be very accurate. As for the other features, I'm not sure. I went to a nutrition lab and they had a scale that measures in the same way as this one, only a much more expensive, commercial model. The weight was the same as on my Omron, but the body fat was about 5% more on the Omron than this commercial grade machine measured. The resting metabolism rate was almost 200 calories lower on the Omron. So all I can say for sure is that the scale is accurate. As to the other features, like the body fat %, it is probably not very accurate. But for the price, it's probably as good as it gets. For me, the important thing is that I see it is consistently increases/decreases in the various measurements, as I'm trying to get in better shape."
2,Couldve done better,"Although I find the scale to be very solid and very easy to read, there definitely needs to be an adjustment made to the body fat calculator. There was a huge discrepancy between the real body fat percentage # and the scale. Approx 50% difference. If you dont mind....its a good buy"
4,Pretty Good Scale,"We've used the scale, not extensively, but with some regularity. Its very sensitive but weights tend to vary by a few pounds, not sure why. The abiltiy to save your profile and look at your weight over a period of time is still a very useful and attractive feature. It was a great scale for a great price. I would recommend it but not if you're going to be tracking your exact weight."
5,Exactly what I wanted,This model has all the features I was looking for. I like that you can setup profiles for each family member.
1,Waste of Money,The only read out I could get was the weight. The purpose of this particular scale was to read my body fat and that's the one thing that didn't work.
5,Bring your patience because it takes a long time.,"I had just finished putting the perimeter of the puzzle together when my 6 year old decided it was time to clean up (while I was out of the room). Needless to say, I probably won't attempt it again until she's a little older."
3,Good only for close recording.,"I bought the total recall voice recorder for the university classes. When I started using it I found that you need to be very close to the subject that you are recording, if not is going to be very hard for you to understand it. For taking personal notes is excellent."
2,"Love the novela, didnt get all the dvds","Rubi was always my favorite novela, I always caught random episodes on tv and so decided to buy the dvds to make sure I could see the entire series whenever I wanted. I was greatly disappointed when I opened the case and saw only one dvd. I hoped that maybe they had somehow managed to shorten the entire series into one DVD. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The one dvd I got, was amazing, the novela is as good as it wa on tv or maybe even better. I cant find the seller's information to file a complaint, its very disappointing!"
3,damage,"THe second cd at the end it was blurry and could not see the end of it. I probably will return the tape for another one. I did not know that the cd's were tape on both sides, it was a bit confusing."
4,Rubi,It was pleasant to watch. It had lots of parts cut. Pretty much all interesting parts were there. Nice extras like bloopers. Blopper very short I wished it had lots more bloopers. Pretty happy. I watched it twice on tv and dvd is decently close.
3,no high low switches AND THECLUTCH HAD TO BE RE ADJUSTED,THE COMPRESSOR WAS A GOOD FIT AND IT WORKED FINE HOWEVER THE SWITCHES WHERE THE HIGH AND LOW PRESSURE WIRES CONNECT TO IT WERE NOT THERE.TRYING TO REMOVE THE OLD SWITCHES FROM MY OLD COMPRESSOR WAS DIFFICULT.I THINK THE COMPRESSOR SHOULD HAVE HAD THESE INCLUDED SINCE THEY ARE PART OF IT.HAD I KNOWN THIS I COULD HAVE SAVED MONEY BUYING FROM A LOCAL AUTO PARTS.the clutch also was out of spec and would not enguage until i rented a puller and re set the clearance.more expense that i didnt count on.
3,All Yours for Only $165,"Unless you're picky and want a ""new"" copy. What a great idea: Put a hundred copies out in 2007, delete it immediately, and make those of us who blinked scurry around for it at usurious prices. WTF?!!!"
1,worst mouse ever.,the first mouse i got just randomly stopped working. the laser wouldnt work but the buttons and the scroll did. then i went ahead and got another mouse. what a mistake. the same thing happened but after an even shorter amount of time of having the mouse. this mouse is JUNK. i usually dont write reviews but this mouse was so poorly made that i just had to say: DONT BUY IT.
1,Stopped working in 2 months,"Yup, I'm another victim of this short-lived mouse, which was great while it lasted. I recommend looking into Kensington products - I had a very similar retractable pocket mouse from them that I used for almost two years without a problem, until I lost it and bought this instead."
2,"danger, danger, danger","My 5 year old daughter has wanted one of these for forever but I was hesitant to get this plastic projectile. She got it as a gift and loves it, but I still have to secure the area of little brothers before sky dancer takes off. Unpredictable flight patterns and hard plastic parts are a recipie for disaster. I flinch at every take off!"
4,Icky AND fantastic,"Only began 2 wks ago. No can do in liquid, sorry. Just too hard to drink down. Gelcaps to my rescue, I filled 00's, filled a sm jar, now I take 3-4 w/Breakfast & dinner. Notice movements are ez & bulked up. I also now eliminate 1-2 x daily now. Great! No discomfort, I'm with it for several mos trial. Dr. suggested fiber, I googled & this came up as the best. I will revise this review as I continue."
2,The White Hornbook is OK,"If you are in Secured Credit and are using White's textbook - ""Secured Transactions - Teaching Materials"" copyright 2000, do not buy his hornbook. He has merely lifted the explanatory text from the textbook and put it together as a hornbook. Furthermore, if you are looking for help on Secured Credit, there are other books that work much harder to make it understandable to the novice. ""Understanding Article 9"" is one of them."
3,Going out with Bang,"Despite the exit of Delta Burke (who will always be a fan fave), Jan Hooks was always a cut up and a nice addition. Judith Ivey was a toned-down ""Julia-wanna-be"". Sheryl Lee Ralph was a surprise but didn't help the cause. All of the original members including Alice Ghostley still make this worth having for it's terrific lines."
1,"the whole story it ISN""T (for the whole story edition only)","Beware. This is a great edition of Heidi, annotations in the margins and a very nice translation and easy to read and read out loud. BUT...this is ONLY HALF OF THE STORY. It is NOT the whole story, as ironic as that seems. Unknown to me, Heidi was published in two volumes and this edition only includes the first half of the entire story of Heidi - arriving on the Alp, going to Frankfort and returning home. and that's where it spits you out. I found this so ironic because it is the ""whole story"" edition. It made me laugh but not while I was sitting in Switzerland trying to read the story to my kid. Very annoying."
2,Made me want to scream,"This is one strange movie. Two sisters wait in a beautiful 19th-century mansion as the third sister is dying in the bed chamber. The dying sister is the artist of the family and is friendly with Anna, the maid, who ""nurses"" her when she is in distress. Sister #2 is having an affair with an indifferent doctor. Sister #3 is a frigid, unloving wretch who inexplicably puts broken glass into...ell, never mind. How any of this makes sense is beyond me.I picked this up to get ""spouse points"" with my wife, but ended up in the negative column. It'll take two viewings of ""The Sound of Music"" to begin to make up for what I lost watching this weird piece of cinema.But, if you're a Bergman fan, your mileage may vary."
1,You'll wish YOU had a terminal disease.,"Watch the interview with Bergman and his red-headed friend, whats-his-name, to get an idea of how big a jerk this guy is. Listen as he proudly discusses the fact that he was a rotten husband and absentee father who cared only for his work. What a guy...As for the movie, it strikes me as something that you may want to [fall asleep] to."
5,"Instead of a ""mean"" they should call it a ""nice""","I had the privelege of taking an MBA level course from Andy Siegel. The style of the text reflects the simply, user-friendly way he communicates in class. Not having taken a stats class before, I was happy to find a professor who could take a dry, complex subject and make it interesting and relatively painless. More professors should use this text!"
4,classic Marian Keyes,"This book is in Marian Keyes' classic style: nicely paced, three interesting heroines with tangled love-lives, and a sparkling way of capturing conversations. If you enjoy Bridget Jones or Curse of the Singles Table style books, then you will probably enjoy this book. A good summer read."
4,"Just funny, very funny - but not profound","I recommend this book just for people who want to have fun. It's really hilarious. But please, don't buy this book waiting for a serious, profound, wise plot - no, no, nothing like this... I liked reading it because I didn't take it seriously. Still, the most outrageous mistake of the book was to treat infidelity with ""glamour"", as if this kind of behaviour (cheating a wife/husband) is a right thing to do in life and even something luxurious and glamorous!! Don't buy this idea! Because of that, Jojo's story was the least likeable in my view. Lily is totally hilarious and Gemma as well. I had a wonderful week reading this light stuff."
4,Back to her original wit!,"After the disappointing Angels and Sushi for Beginners, I had begun to think Marian Keyes had lost her ability to write great books. So without much fanfare, I picked up The Other Side of the Story. It was wonderful. Each character was unique and interesting. I could not put the book down. Keyes keeps you reading by weaving an interesting story of these three women's lives. This book reminded me of the format for Last Chance Salon. If you have been a fan of Keyes since Watermelon, this one is for you."
4,Classic Keyes,The book though dealing with a serious subject was really funny. Keyes is a witty gifted writer. The supporting cast was great. It stirred up some feelings about infidelity but I liked that the ending was not cut and dry.
2,Boring,I've read a few of Marian Keyes books and this is the worst by far. I was bored from page 1 and only made it to page 90 before giving up.
2,Wasn't as good as I'd thought,"In one respect, I was pretty intrigued by the story outline and all, however, in another respect, the entire book had me befuddled through and through as I tried to figure out who was who in terms of its characters in the story.Essentially, it was a mind-boggling reading session for me. Definitely not one that makes you go, 'OOOh' but rather 'Oh.'"
4,Quite possibly Keyes's best work yet,Keyes does a brilliant job of connecting these three women with seemingly disparate lives.
1,Boring,"I am usually a fan of chick lit books, but this was was very boring. I had trouble picking it up again once I put it down, and the only reason I got through to the end was because I needed something to read on a couple of flights. Needless to say, the book didn't make it back home with me. The characters were much too predictable and full of cliches, the plot lines were boring. The story dragged on for way too long.The three women in this book had no dimension and the author failed to paint an interesting and captivating story for any of them. Don't waste your money on this one unless you're buying it used off of Amazon for a few cents. I have enjoyed some of the other books by Keyes, but this one fell very flat."
3,"Ok, But Not Great","I was very excited that Marian Keyes was coming out with a new book. I loved Lucy Sullivan, One Chance Saloon, Sushi for Beginners and, to a lesser extent, Watermelon. However, I found this one disappointing and a bit boring. I never felt emotionally attached to any of the characters, which with Keyes past books I had. I liked Gemma in the beginning, but by the end was sick of her. Lily was way to whinny and her and Anton's love at first sight was just too neat to justify the situation. Jojo's relationship problems just dragged on for too long that by the time the inevitable happened, I didn't care. Overall, that was probably my biggest problem with this book, everything was too prolonged, I would have liked to see more action.On the plus side, Keyes did do a wonderful job of interweaving the main characters' stories. Even though I was disappointed with this book, I was still able to get through it relatively quickly, which is a testament to Keyes terrific writing style."
5,"Patrizio Buanne, Live In Concert",This is a MUST for any Patrizio fan. The only problem is it is a Region 2 DVD. It will not play on all players. It is a great program!!!!!
1,Wannabe kung fu movie,"I have only one word for this movie: HORRIBLE! The acting was abysmal, the story line was non-existent....but the fighting scenes were actually cool... It's an entertaining movie if you ONLY want to watch it for the fight scenes... If you want more...this is not the movie for you."
4,Raw and Real,I found this movie to be very real and its emotions played right to the nerve. The acting was tremendous. What I did not like about the film was that it never let up. I couldn't wait for the film to be over. It was depressing right from the beginning and never let up. I did not feel entertained - I felt drained. I believe that some stories need to be told. I wish there was more of a victory for the main character at the end. I almost wish I never watched it.
2,could be better but fell short far and wide,"trying very hard to tell something about a girl's painful, disappointing desire and loss, but fell short and ultimately became a quite boring and slow-motion film. the whole setting of this film is purposely gone slow, trying to make the life and the world kinda slow and bored. i've remembered several similar films almost like twins to this movie, but they were better and faster spaced. the young girl is a promising actor if she knows how to enhance and self-restrain herself during her growing stages."
3,A Schlock Classic,"I don't know about recommending this one! Made in the sixties, it was either a very risque drive-in film, or a low grade porno. In any case, it is very tame by modern standards. The ""Man-Eaters"" is an all-female biker gang, who pick up guys and then take them out for a ""drag"" behind their bikes ""afterwards"". It's so bad you can't stop watching. The gang-rape of the guy they pick up (and his howling) is so absurd it's laughable. Enough said, it's a campy/schlock classic."
3,Gunslick Universal Bore Guide,Gunslick Universial Bore GuideIt looks cheap but I haven't used it yet. Gunslick products do have a good name.
4,If only we had higher ceilings...,"My daughter is only 2 1/2, but she loves her Sky Dancer. We haven't been able to see how high she really goes since our ceilings are about 8 feet, and she hits the ceiling when we pull the cord. I think it's a fun toy for children."
3,Post Taliban Afghanistan.,"Anderson is a great writer and I enjoyed his biography of Che. This book is a series of articles Anderson wrote for the New Yorker magazine. It is obvious that Anderson placed himself at some risk in getting these stories and I enjoyed his viewpoint on post Taliban Afghanistan. The only good insightful material was about the assasination of Massoud and how it was done. Little of this has filtered out to the West. Much of the rest of the book was a rehash of what other journalists have found out about Afghanistan.This is a short enjoyable read by a great writer. There are other books out there that are better. However, this is a concise read on post Taliban Afghanistan."
5,Once more enter the darkness and meet Bergman.,"""From the life of Marionettes"" is a dark tale told by its multiple and unreliable characters. The plot begins with a shocking event through which the main character is introduced, where the audience is forced to judge him by the face value. What comes after is one of the most beautiful manifestations of Bergmanian prophecies: liberal, bitter, and extremely dark. This is a psychological hallucination, a bizzare experience in human relationship. Watch and levitate."
1,Very disappointing for a long time fan,"I've been a fan of Paul Heaton since I first heard The Housemartins in the mid 1980s, and own every full-length Beautiful South CD available. I was looking forward to see how they'd handle a cover album. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. If I hadn't received this as a gift, I would most certainly have returned it. Most of the tracks just didn't work for me. Only ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" found its way onto my MP3 player - compared to virtually every track of their original work. I can not in good conscience recommend this to anyone.If you're new to The Beautiful South, I'd suggest starting with ""Carry On Up The Charts"" to hear what a great band they truly are."
1,"Three times a charm, huh?",I bought the first one for my daughter after seeing the commercials and she fell in love with it. The first one didn't even work straight out of the box so back to the store it went. The second one broke after three pulls of the string. That one went back. The third one worked for quite a few pulls for about a half hour then broke as well. She wants a fourth but I'm done!
4,Good toy for the money,"My kids (girls 5 and 7) have wanted these for several months but I was unwilling to pay the $15.99 price at Wal-Mart. I jumped at the chance to get two for [...] each. This is a good toy for inside or outside. Don't be fooled by the extreme reviews. It's unrealistic to think this toy will fly for more than a few seconds nor will it fly higher than 12 to 18 inches. The more they play with it, the easier it gets for them to use it. It's good for several hours of fun at a time."
3,reasonable price/content,It is difficult to find good books in this line of reading.On the positive note this book has international variety and fairly good pictures.These points considered I would say very good value for money especially if compared to some Martin Pegler offerings.On the down side it is a little one dimensional and the soft cover is well.......a soft cover!
2,Formulaic,"Here's the formula: 1 part politically correct message (instead of racism against blacks in the south or racism against Japanese in the west, here we get an entirely new approach -- racism against Japanese in the south) plus 1 part disease of the month (lymphoma) plus 1 part non-western ethnicity = Newbery award. Let me quote a recent article by the Director of Research at the National Endowment for the Arts lamenting the decline of reading, especially among boys: ""Both boys and girls are unlikely to choose books based on an 'issues' approach, and children are not interested in reading about ways to reform society."" Why hasn't the Newbery committee figured this out? This year's award should have gone to Sea of Trolls, by Nancy Farmer, a book that neither boys nor girls can put down. Wake up, Newbery committee, or you will find yourself deemed irrelevant by readers out here."
2,"Who judged this? It won over something as good as ""Al Capone Does My Shirts""?","I can't believe it! The storyline was ok and all, but there were much better 2005 books that deserved something as honorable as the Newbery. This book will be on the list of ""the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children"", up with ""The Tale of Despereaux"", ""Holes"", ""Missing May"", ""Julie of the Wolves"", and ""Johnny Tremain"". It just wasn't good enough. Maybe good for the HONOR, but not the MEDAL!!This doesn't make sense!!?!!!?!?!??"
2,A Series of Unfortunate Events,I kept waiting for the book to turn around and read like an award winner. It didn't happen. Kira Kira is a depressing book written for adults who decide awards based on the angst-meter.
2,"Well, um, kind of let down","I feel let down by the Newbery Commitee this year. I can understand why some people would like this book and I respect their opinions but I just can't enjoy this book. Maybe it was how I was reading it but I never was really sad about anything that happened. It was a well written book but, to me, there was nothing to keep me motivated to read or excite me.Maybe I'm just not getting the point but for one reason or another I just didn't find anything at all special in this book. I feel that ""Wenny has Wings"" by Jan Lee Carey is a much better book that also relates to the feeling potrayed in this novel."
3,"not the best, not the worst","the weapons choice and mission scenarios are great in this game, the controls however will take you days to figure out, but u can switch them which is good. one or two shots and ur dead, which makes the gameplay hard to get used to. it's also choppy and hard to manuever at times. rent it before you buy it."
2,Just a lot of noise,"Granted, the afficianados will say ""you must not play any instruments"" but as far as enjoying what I am listening to, this ends up being just a lot of noise. The talent is unquestionable, the result for me of this product is that I feel like just deleting it from my hard drive so I am not tempted to try to like it. The two stars are out of respect for other works done."
3,"Not the author's best, but OK","Sylvia Thorpe can weave a spell with her books when she is at her best. This one had some promising elements: A poor relation enters high society, but she has a secret to hide. A blackmailer enters her life. It threatens her newly found love for the hero. But after setting up this plot, the book ends abruptly with a quick resolution, like the author ran out of time. I would recommend Romantic Lady instead. It is set in Regency Society, and is more satisfying to read.Pluses include the fact that the author generally wrote better villains than Heyer. One minus is a strong similarity to Friday's Child."
5,beautiful sandals,"The color is beautiful, just as seen on my screen. The color is also somewhat neutral so that I could wear these sandals with many outfits/colors. The design of the straps is very elegant and summery. I love sandals with heels of this height because I get the benefit of a more sexy leg without the discomfort I experience with higher heels. The straps are also very comfortable and do NOT cut into my feet (even though I have rather wide feet). As for size, I got a size 8 and feel it is true to size. Definitely one of the most beautiful sandals I have ever worn."
2,poor,"Delkin DD/ENEL5 Rechargeable Battery Equivalent to Nikon EN-EL5This battery is pictured in what seems to be a case.No case or protective cover for the terminals.when you carry a spare battery on a trek a protective cover is nice to have.This has the least mAh of all the batteries I have, 860mAh.I have 2 @ 1500mAh & the one that came with the camera @ 11mAh"
4,An excellent overview for the uninitiated,"This is a nice compilation of BoDeans tunes from throughout their recording career, and includes at least one cut from every album. As will always be the case with long-time fans, I have particular favorites which were not included (""That's All,"" ""Good Work,"" ""The Other Side""), but I really can't quibble with the selections which are here. ""She's A Runaway"" was the first BoDeans song I ever heard and it's still one of the best; ""Fadeaway"" is a long-time favorite; ""Say About Love"" and ""Feed The Fire"" are both from their live album and rock out nicely. There are some strong mid-tempo ballads as well (""I'm In Trouble Again,"" ""Paradise"") and the song my son and I love to sing along with in the car (as do BoDeans concert-goers) ""Still The Night."" Highly recommended."
2,Slash & Burn,"I was a Bodeans fan from the first record, and I have to say that even I wouldn't buy this one. The stuff they did on their first three albums is vastly superior to the Joe Dirt offerings.The Bodeans truly rocked and popped on their first recordings, and then tried to go in a different direction - and in my opinion, lost their way.I was at every Bodeans show in the NYC area for quite a few years, and my co-workers were right there with me. But we just didn't feel it with the Joe Dirt album."
4,Multiple Points of view that the reader will weave together and enjoy,"Very quick and satisfying reading. The device of the tale being told through bits and scraps of varying length from the file on the titular Miernik was a device that worked well. A variety of voices and perspectives get at least reasonable presentation. The reader can fill in the gaps well enough and some of the characters, especially Kalash, are great fun."
5,GOOD DEAL,"What a great deal, this is not only a book, but also includes an interactive CD. Having the CD makes all the difference, it allows you to prepare your resume and cover letter using the examples provided by the author. Why struggle through this process when you can do it so simply and easily right on your computer with the CD."
3,Good concept,This pillow seemed like a good idea for our cross country trip so I bought it for our 3 year old daughter. As it turns out she wanted to hold it but would wake up and cry each time I'd attach it to her seat belt. This is only a good buy if you're sure your child will use it. Hopefully she'll take a liking to it as she gets older.
3,Pretty but nor useful,I love Tarot cards and I am Catholic so I love the Saints. The cards are very pretty however it is hard to get use the fact that they do not speak to me like my other tarot cards.
5,Fun skates,"These are great first skates. I was skeptical when my not quite 2 year old son showed a huge interest in skating. We got these skates when he was 22 months old and he was able to scoot around in them immediately. We skipped stage 1 (wheels don't roll) and went immediately to stage 2 (wheels roll forward but not backward). I was planning on holding his hands and pulling him around. He'd have nothing to do with it and was skating on his own within 10 minutes. It's nice to know that these skates will grow with him, both in shoe size and skating ability. My son loves these skates and I think they are perfect for learning."
2,wrong age info for this product!,"These skates only fit up to a size 11 shoe (NOT size 12), so your child will outgrow them by the time he is 4 or 5, not 8! Tentative types will outgrow them before they learn to skate."
3,so-so,Not the version of yakity sax I was looking for. however if you are a fan of the sax - these pure instrumental versions would probably be delightful.
2,"Looks nice, a bit on the cheap side though",And it stopped working after the first rain storm we had. I promptly returned this product and got a different brand.
1,"Why do amazon allow authors reviews to be included against books,",Surely Authors should not be allowed to give inevitable five star reviews to their own books or in this case a book adovcating their own methodology/books.
5,A delightfully delicious find!,"I was delighted to find ""Ruth Wakefield's Toll House: Tried and True Recipes"". Take a tasteful journey back to when food still tasted good and a warm gathering of family and friends was graced with delicious offerings. The simple, tried and true recipes will easily allow you to serve beautiful feasts as well as tempting treats."
3,Not What I Expected,I was a little disappointed - it seems to be more about what Simic would do if he were Joseph Cornell than about Cornell's own work. The NYT review gave another impression of the work...
4,Very cool new design,"For some reason this showed up in my recommended list, and was right up my alley, so I ordered one.I need to explain the 4 star review first. I only give 5 stars to something that is near perfect. The ring is very unique and well built, but it's not perfect. I would have given it 4.5 stars, if possible, but you don't get that option.The ring fits well, the cutout slides out hard at first, but once it's removed, it moves easier. It also does not fall out while being worn, since it covers about 2/3 of the ring, it really can't go anywhere. But as another reviewer noted, the thin line that connects the two crosses can be squeezed shut when the middle piece is removed. It can be reopened easily enough. The edges of the cut out are fairly sharp, probably sharp enough to have to watch out for.Since the ""spinner"" rings are now kind of old news, this is a nice new idea."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"When I firs got this ring ( earlier than the delivery date whichwas good ) I noticed that it looked a little cheap and the inner cross was not connected to the ring and fell out. The ring was a little tight, even though I know I am a size 9 ring from many other purchases. I decided to keep it, being cheap and all, but was going to take it off because it matched nothing I currently wore. When I wet my finger and tried to pull the ring off, the ring broke. right down the center, right out of the box. Seriously, spend the 18$ and get a tungston ring from world jewelry center....they dont break."
5,Body Heat meets The Usual Suspects,"If you like twists and turns and an ending that makes you say, ""OMG I didn't see that coming coming!"" Then you'll enjoy Cold Play. Vanessa Branch is smokin hot! Great entertainment. A great little indy film."
3,"Pleasant, satisfying read","Great little adventure/romance story that reflects the lifestyle and high morals of the time (published in 1939). It was very pleasant to be able to read a good, solid story without worrying about a steamy, explicit sex scene taking away from the story line. The main idea: A young high school graduate is working in a lawyer's office while she hopes to work into a job for the local newspaper. All her friends are off at college, but she can't afford it; however, she is saving to that end. She ends up getting involved in investigative reporting regarding city politics, and is able to solve a mystery that has puzzled the town for several years. There were several story lines on different levels which kept my interest and had me thinking about it for a few days after it was finished. While not a literary masterpiece, it is a nice, satisfying story."
3,good item,Cannot really complain about the product. It does what it is supposed to. Just wish it was smaller.
4,good indication of things to come,"probably the earliest bonnet album available ( just try finding a cd of ""no bad habits"")..but right around the time of the rainbow album ""down to earth"". This album is a great even flow of good melodic rock from the industry's most ignored talent. Theres always been something so cool to me about Bonnet, who has fronted so many classic bands while resembling a pompadored disco king, but he has the pipes to make any album hes on blow away the competition. Most of the songs are good hard rock tunes backed up by cozy powell, mick moody and deep purples jon lord. I personally could do without the doo wop cover tunes, but if you want to hear what promted ritchie blackmore to hire him for rainbow...give it a listen."
1,blade not designed for models listed,blade description stated that it was compatible with KFP300WH modesl; not so-wrong size and shape
5,BEST animated movie I've ever seen!!!!,"I love Dragon Ball Z and have seen the entire series, it's great! I liked Deadzone best because it had the most action. Go Gohan!"
4,Smiles and laughs from Dave Barry,Maybe not his best work but certainly a fun read. Dave Barry continues to use his clever wit to keep his readers turning the pages and chuckling.
3,"My Teenage Son's Goal In Life Is..."" the review.","In this book, author Steve Barry talks about raising his son and other parenting. There are some very funny segements in this book, however it is repetitive and they are Extremly short lines. The way the book is, it stands at about four inches and has a very short paragraph on each page. So, really, you are getting over a hundred Short onl-liners. The entire book could be read by everyone, he does not curse in this book. If a slow reader, you could read it in under 30 minutes, but it will not really seem time consuming being that it {the book itself} is quite humorus. Not the best I have read, but for a little pick-me-up in the morning, it sure did the job for me.Have a good one.Ryan"
3,"a little small, but functional","This item is small, but it is functional. I only have a problem with it because I have tons of pots, and they don't really fit well on it...but with the amount of space I have, it works perfectly in my kitchen."
4,A Perfect Gift for the Serious Piano Student,"Maurice Hinson's earlier revision of GUIDE TO THE PIANIST'S REPERTOIRE was of great assistance to me in my own college piano study, and its accuracy in listing historical content makes this text a most valuable tool for piano students who are ready for a more global vision of our history's piano composers and repertoire. Although brief, Mr. Hinson's sketch biography of each composer well captures his/her musical style, and his scholarly-detailed information allows the reader very succinct information regarding the listed repertoire and level of difficulty. In his current 3rd revision, Mr. Hinson also includes national, international and women composers! This GUIDE will continue to be one of my most valuable reference tools in shaping the young pianist's understanding of quality piano literature."
2,Who editted this one?,"This video had a lot going for it until the editor got his hands on it. Beautiful Gina Adore ready to show it all to you, only to have the editor fade away or cut out right at the moment of truth. The incredible Shawn Young doing what looks like the most explicit girl / girl action of her career, yet camera angles and editing that leave us feeling like we missed something very hot. Not a bad video if you like being unmercilously teased."
4,Biokleen citrus auto dish powder,"Really like this dish powder. Leaves no residue and no funny odors like some other natural products do. Have not even been adding the rinse aid lately, still great results."
4,"A bit scary, but written with a sense of humor","My mom bought this book for me, and (I'll admit) I thought it was such a waste. A whole book about buying one dress! I read it, and was alternately horrified by some of the practices in the bridal industry, and amused by their tongue-in-cheek style of writing. When I finally did visit bridal salons I felt well-informed and a lot less like a rube because of this book. Don't let the Fields and some of their truly horrifying tales scare you too much, however. Take their warnings as points of caution, and not as reasons to abandon the search entirely."
5,Neat Extras,"I have been a fan of theGodfathermovies for years (except for part 3). Even read thebook(a great read too!). So when EA released this game, I HAD to get the limited edition version. And it's well worth the extra money (at the time when it came out; it's under $10 now, used).The game had sort of aGrand Theft Autostyle to it, but the guys at EA made great use of the Playstation control. I was happily amazed that ALL the buttons (analog sticks too) were used in playing the game...and not just for simple movements either. Using each analog stick you can strangle your victim, slam them against the wall, or bash their heads against a cash register. What fun!!The bonus DVD came with a little making-of stuff that showed the old actors from the movie (the one's alive, of course) doing voice-work in the studio. Great fun for kids of all ages and anyone who's a Godfather fan!"
5,easy to choose,"I found very easy to purchase this item, the color was perfect for my face and i choosed it online with out a previous product on my hand to guide meGreat seller"
3,Cheap baskets,"I really like the liner for this basket, but I have been very disappointed by the quality of the basket itself. It would be fine if you only wanted to use it for very light objects like diapers, but I use mine for board books. After only a few weeks of use, my baskets have lost their shape and lean to one side. My daughter leaned on one of the baskets and the top split. It's just made out of straw wrapped in raffia. You're basically paying for a twenty-dollar liner. The inexpensive basket I got at Walmart for her toys is holding up much better and it gets more use."
1,Wrong size / age information,"I thought I had found the perfect gift for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas! To my dismay, when the product arrived tonight, I found that I need to go through the hastle of returning the skates. The description states for ages 5 - 10. They would never fit my daughter as the skates are actually intended for children who wear shoe sizes up to size 12 and weigh 44 lbs. or less. How disappointing!!! This should be corrected immediately to save other parents the frustration I am now experiencing!"
3,A fun addition to the LP collection,"Our daughter received the train as a gift for her second birthday. She really enjoys driving it around her room with the animals moving up and down, and twirling around. Actually she usually takes the animals out and put some of her LP children in the train.This train is a great little toy and makes a nice gift that is not too expensive. The only thin that FP could do to improve the train is make the pegs for the animals a little narrower. It is a tight squeeze to get the character on the see-saw pegs, but it is a minor inconvenience.Otherwise this toy is absolutely great!"
2,BEWARE: This notebook has power problems,"I was VERY happy with this computer for the first 7 months until it crashed. Come to find out that out of 300 students at my law school, 7-8 have had power failures on their Compaq laptops (and very few students have Compaqs in the first place). Please ask around before you purchase this computer because unbeknownst to me Compaq (now HP) has apparently tried to reduce costs on notebooks and it shows!I will give it 2 stars because luckily it crashed within its warranty (unluckily 2 weeks before exams!) and the tech support people were helpful and I can send it for repairs for free. However, many of my classmates have not been so lucky..."
5,A Single Man,"Rarely have I seen a film more brilliantly executed. It was gripping, fascinating, sad and beautiful. Tom Ford is an incredible director. I loved the way he made small gestures convey so many feelings, thoughts and action. I think Will Firth deserved an Oscar for this and was robbed of it. Christopher Isherwood was incredible to watch, he did not appear a lot in the movie but his time onscreen packed a strong punch. It's a movie that will stay with you for a long, long time."
4,"A gorgeous, sumptuous film.","This film is so beautiful. The actors and actresses are so skilled, and the cinematography is amazing. I really enjoyed the glimpse of California in the 60s. This movie wasn't meant to be an action-packed thriller, so don't whine if you think it's too slow."
4,A Single Man,This was a good movie although very sad. Colin Firth's acting was excellent along with Julianne Moore. Again a sad story.
1,stay away,"This is possible the worst movie that I have seen in a long long time. I normally like the stars, but the glamorization of gay life is offensive. I don't want to watch gay intimacy and that is what you get here. I never liked any character in this movie. don't waste your time or money."
3,A Depressing Man.,"A Single Man is a good film but it didn't blow me away. I have always thought of Colin Firth as a boring, uninteresting actor but he turns in an amazing performance here - really shows his surprising range. Julianne Moore and Matthew Goode deliver stellar performances as well. A Single Man is a very slow film, nothing special but not a total disappointment either. A mixed bag for me."
5,Five stars but...,"This books rates five stars since I t believe that it is a good book and a whole lot better than most children's books today. That said, I wasn't all that impressed with the story and there wasn't as much historical reference as I would have liked."
2,"i did not read it, nor should my 6yr.old read it, too soon..1st grade?","I am sure this is a great book but age and class appropriate as well My daughter is 6 and in 1st grade, her teacher was Sorry she found it boring. Perhaps it was her teachers favorite, maybe next year."
1,No follow through.,"I expected a lesson in advanced photography. The text was informative, the photographs were not. Many example photographs that were supposed to instruct me in the use of colored gels on flashes or lights were printed in black and white! What a disappointment!"
3,Mirror Mirror,"The movie had some enjoyable moments and some just plain silly ones. The hardest part for me was the first 30 minutes, because I couldn't stop staring at Snow Whites humongous eyebrows!"
3,Eh...,"I was told this movie was worth watching for the costume design alone. After watching Mirror, Mirror, I would agree. The movie was worth watching for the costume design alone. Otherwise.... eh."
2,Disappointed,We saw this at the movies. There were only 3 or 4 sets through this whole movie. They kept showing the same shot of the castle or the same shot of her coming out of the water. The ending singing and dance scene was so out of place and odd. It felt like you skipped into Slumdog Millonaire. For adults it was bad but my kids enjoyed it. There were some funny dwarf scenes. As an adult I am rating it 2 stars. My kids would probably give it 3 stars.
3,Its cute,my kids like it.its enjoyable. if your looking for a dark heavy movie this aint it. julia roberts appeared to have a lot of fun with this and good for her for taking on a role where she is the bad guy and dealing with the fact she's aging. still gorgeous but she is getting older. i appreciate this movie and her part in it. its a graceful way to say i'm getting older and can't play the leading lady forever there is some one younger and brighter than me but i'm cool with that cause i'm julia roberts
2,Painful on the ears and a bit tedious,Julia Roberts who I enjoy as an actor killed her character for me with the in and out faulty accent from no where. Though the story is pretty good I felt it was inconsistant and often tedious rythmically. The humor was also often more painful than funny. I enjoyed the minor characters the most!
2,"Julia Roberts fan, but not a fan of this movie",This was like watching Julia Roberts' romantic comedy persona filling in for Angelica Huston. The tone of the movie was equally as confused.
4,Not great but quirky enough to be good,"This is kind of an odd film. A number of reviewers have covered the ways in which a well-known fairy tale has been retold. To me, the draw of the film isn't so much that it's a version of Snow White, but rather that it's a quirky re-telling of a fairy tale. There is just enough humor and just enough odd scenes that it keeps your attention. Even the settings are kind of strange. They are a mix of medieval and fantasy. Nathan Lane and Julia Roberts make for a very engaging and comical pairing. The seven dwarfs are played by well-known short actors and are very quirky but funny. This movie seems like it will delve into some cruel or violent scenes, but somehow it manages to always pull back enough not to spoil things. When I started watching the movie it seemed like something from out in left field. By the time I was done, I had been entertained by something just different enough to keep my attention."
5,Loved it!,I went and saw this movie with my brother and wasn't sure what to expect but I loved it! It is my favorite Snow White movie by far and I loved the soundtrack. I liked how the colors were vivid and the scenery was beautiful. Also how the story was funny and lighthearted. I would say what I enjoyed the most was that Snow White was just the right amount of heroine and damsel mixed together. She kicked butt while still maintaining her princess sweetness. I am looking forward to buying it as soon as it comes out.
2,NOT my cup of tea,"I was expecting to have fun watching this, but instead... I found myself actually a bit irritated and put off. Definitely not my cup of tea as far as fanciful comedy, or however you want to catagorize this. Very disappointed."
4,Great Movie,"This movie is visually spectacular and has an interesting plot.It pleased both a 50yo dad and a 9yo daughter.And the film is a bit profound. It is a story about female aging and the agony of losing beauty and being surpassed by the younger woman.Every beautiful woman knows or fears this life transition. Hopefully, they don't adopt the Queen's defense."
3,"Mirror, Mirror","This was a ""new"" version of Snow White and it came up short. It was more like watching a stage play rather than a movie. The stars couldn't make this movie any better."
3,"A little on the slow side, but good overall",I expected this movie to be a little faster paced than it was based on the story it's based off of. Overall it was good just don't expect to be on the edge of your seat at anytime throughout the movie.
2,Tedious.,"This movie was disappointing--it was boring, tedious, not funny, not as clever as is pretended to be. The only reason I wanted to watch it was to see the costumes, which were very inventive and beautiful, but could not sustain my interest throughout."
3,Ordered for Grandkids,All the Grandkids really enjoyed this movie along with some of the adults. Worth renting on a cold wintry day
1,falls way too short in content,"What a disappointment and waste of talent! I expected a clever,enjoyable version of this classic fairy tale,but instead got a dry boring remake."
5,Mirror Mirror,"Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer, Nathan Lane, Sean Bean work extremely well in this movie. It is funny threw out the movie and gives you a new look at Snow White. Great movie!!!"
5,Delightful Fun Twist on a Classic!!,"I wanted to see this on the big screen but had to wait to rent -- So excited to watch it finally. I won't spoil the movie for anyone so will just lay out a few things. Here they lay this great story out from start to finish and it is complete, makes sense, all fits well together nicely, of course there is a happy ending. They do change some things around such as the dwarfs names etc. Not everything is EXACT. For me, it was a good change. There is many twists in the story and it is funny. It is quirky and dark. My whole family liked it a lot, will buy when it gets cheaper. I would recommend to anyone except perhaps really young kids who scare easily. No curse words, clean film."
2,Disappointed,"I love Julia Roberts, and eagerly looked forward to seeing this movie - the commercials were inviting. Unfortunately, the movie was a real disappointment."
1,so dark and so slow,This did not gave a good impression as the hd version is so scaled down and the movie is so dark.
4,Good for kids,Pretty good movie. Different view point that the Disney version. Can recommend to all ages as it had no extreme violence or sex or bad language.
3,Cute movie,"Cute movie, but a little tedious. Drags in places and just lacks the ability to keep you interested for any length of time."
4,Cute family film,This is a great movie for families with children 10 and under. Lots of laughs and a unique twist on the traditional story.
5,Movie,This is a great movie. Julia Roberts (as usual) does an awesome job. Shows a different view on Snow White and it does turn out as we expect it to.
3,Mirror Mirror,I felt that this movie was not worthy of Ann Hathaway and Julia Roberts. I did not finish watching the movie.
5,Love It !!!,I rented this to watch on a flight to Orlando. My friend is afraid of flying and this movie had us cracking up. Before we knew it it was time to land. Two thumbs up.
1,You've got to be Kidding,"Yes this book is very sensuous, but please some of the language set my teeth on edge. I gritted them to finish the novel. Where in a Regency novel would the hero speak of dollars? What kind of heroine has a ""deep funk"" and does a Regency wedding groom wear a ""frock coat"" (more synomynous with Abraham Lincoln/Civil War era than the Regency)These errors were found in the first 50 pages. This novel is not a keeper for me"
5,Indespenible,"..................one cannot go wrong with this title if you're a beginner or a pro, this is the book of books to have at arms length for review of how to do it !!!!!GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets) (998068C)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,husband lives in them,my husband gets a pair of these every yr and he wears them to death lol he wears them yr round inside and out and loves them worth the money
2,Needs design adjustment.,"After wearing the Sassybax Torso Trim with Underwire just a few hours, I find that the straps are too narrow. They roll and become very uncomfortable. The bra feels good across the back, but the straps need to be redesigned to be wider and not made to stretch. This also cuts down on the support you get."
5,Funniest movie ever!,A timeless classic. This is the comedic genius of Andy Griffith back before he became the straight man for Barney Fife. There are so many well-known actors in this movie. I have seen it over ten times and I never get tired of it!
4,"This is th stage play, not the movie",I got this VCR thinking that it was the movie with Don Knotts and Myron McCormic. It was not. It was the stage play with different support actors and recorded on video tape. I enjoyed it and it is a good companion to the movie version with Myron McCormic and Don Knotts
3,Be Aware - NOT the original format!,"I have the VHS version of this movie as well as this DVD. When you look at them side by side, you can see that the VHS tape version cut off the left and right sides of the movie to make it a 4:3 aspect ratio. However, while this DVD included the entire horizontal image, it cut off the top and bottom to make the movie appear to be more of a wide-screen than it was. It would be great if these companies restoring these movies would have the integrity to let us see the entire image - not matter what the aspect ratio.They also added too much brightness and contrast, but overall, that made the film look better than my VHS version."
2,the memory was better than the reviewing,"I saw this many years ago and at that time it was funny. It still has some funny lines but all in all, my memory of the show should have been left at that--a memory. In 1958 this was solid stuff and while the play depicts Will Stockdale's stint in the Army, it is still funny but pales in light of all the new technology. This was a live performance and as such did not have the scenery changes, revolving stages, etc. that live shows have today. Andy Griffith was a sure-fire hit in this role and right on the money in his performance. That I remember well."
5,Great entertainment,"I remember watching this as a young teen and was excited to see it offered on Amazon. Ordered 3 copies and sent two as gifts. The recipients equally enjoyed this DVD, Great, clean humor and family friendly."
4,Great Little Powerhouse Camera,"I have had this camera for three weeks now and have been totally impressed with its ease of use and excellent picture quality. Every review you read about digital cameras has a negative comment about battery use. These cameras use a lot of power- more power than an alkaline battery can dish out. If you buy the NiMh battery charger and a spare set of batteries you will not have any problems. I have been 2 weeks on my fully charged mah 1600 batteries and they are still performing well, and I always use the LCD all the time, and have even used the 2x digital zoom. This camera takes some of the most vivid, in-depth photos I have seen on a low-end priced digital camera. It's small compact size makes it fun to carry everywhere you go. I would highly reccomend this camera to beginner and novice alike."
3,Fooled again!,"I have not been pleased with streisand's singing or CDs since Higher Ground. This CD I had very high hopes for, but it's a pretty boring CD. Why does Barbra work with the same people over and over and produce the same sound all the time? Couldn't she throw in an up tempo surprise here and there? I would have loved Babs to try doing one of the Prince Songs from Purple Rain or maybe something from Saturday Night Fever (with Barry Gibb producing!) or what about a comedy number from a forgotten musical? Why not some of the never used songs Sondheim wrote for the Birdcage or Dick Tracy? Why does she seem to sing the same type of music all the time? Barbra, hook up with a young producer/songwriter with vision. Why not a Barbra CD produced by Moby or perhaps record a country CD with Nashvilles best? She needs some young blood."
1,"The first track is ""Smile"", but I didn't","This is a disappointing effort from one of the most gifted vocalists ever. Somewhat overproduced, the major problem is that you can literally hear la Streisand trying to sound interesting, trying to put affect into each song. Buy the new Bette Midler tribute to Rosemary Clooney instead. Now THAT is an inspired cd. . ."
2,Barbra's Weakest Efford to date...,"Not sure, but Barbra's voice on this new CD is much whispery and low than any of her other albums. No belting or trademark high notes are heard in this new recording. The songs are kinda boring and slow. I like one or the most two songs on this CD."
2,lacklustre,"my initial thoughts of this album were that it's boring.after several listens to it this remains my impression still.there are two problems:1. the song choices. they are dull. streisand needs to hold back and allow the album's producer and A&R; guy do their jobs. that's what they are paid for.2. the songs arrangements. they are dull. streisand needs to hold back and allow the song arrangers do their their jobs. that's what they are paid for.it seems that this streisand vehicle suffers from that recurring problem: streisandisation. the woman has too much hold on the product and just can't let go, and there seems to be no one willing to tell her when she's getting it wrong.now, if you want a DECENT streisand album, listen to ""guilty pleasures""/""guilty too"". in one is charge (barry gibb) know what he's doing and he does it very well. streisand's job is to do what she does very well and that is to simply open her mouth and sing."
2,Tell Me It Isn't So,"It's almost sacrilege to give a Streisand album 2 stars but that's the best I could do for this one. Maybe I expected familiar songs as in the 'Broadway Album'. Her voice is still top notch but I found this album too slick and over-produced. The only songs I enjoyed were Moon River, Smile and The Second Time Around. She trashed 'I'm In The Mood For Love' with a Bossa Nova beat no less. Right down there with 'Back To Broadway' album."
2,Beautiful Voice on a Boring Album,"Nobody in the music business sounds as good as Barbra. At 61, she continues to delight her fans everywhere with her beautiful voice. However, I was very disappointed in this new release.THE MOVIE ALBUM is a collection of songs, some recongizable, some not, from movies. Surprisingly, Barbra does not use her own movies. ""Smile"" is wonderfully done, but as the album continues, it begins to sound all the same. ""Moon River"" is never a good choice for an album, in my opinion. This song is overly done, and not really worth Barbra's time. By about the fifth song on each listen, I had to put in something else or I would fall asleep.I'm a fan of Barbra's, and will continue to support her work. However, if she continues to release boring music, I will not be as inclined to purchase it."
1,"Barbra, what were you thinking?",THIS CD IS HORRIBLE!!!!!I consider myself to be one of Barbra's biggest fans for over 25 years. I was so excited to hear this cd but wow was I ever disappointed. Every song sounds the same and there is no passion in any of the songs. And whats up with the obsure songs she chose to sing? Absolutely dreadful. It's got to be one of her worst CD's ever. I can't even give this away.
3,Dissapointed,"Although this album is technically superb I was dissapointed in the song selection, with the exception of a few tracks the entire CD sounds the same. With all the great songs from movies that are out there I feel Barbra could have provided us with a wider rang of style and selection. Of course Ms. Streisand is in great voice and the alblum is expertly produced."
2,What A Waste Of Talent,"I bought this album based on Barbra's compelling performance and lovely material on ""The Broadway Album."" What a mistake. Why Barbra Streisand, who I believe should not retire from music because of the gift of her voice, would choose this uneven, tedious and vapid material to showcase her gift simply baffles me. This CD should have been entitled ""The Obscure Moive Album."" She could have selected from a wealth of material and instead she settled for mediocrity. What a shame."
2,a little boring,I've read a lot of the other reviews and I must say that I found the CD somewhat dissapointing. I still think she has the greatest voice in the world but this CD is over-produced. I would love to hear Streisand in a more intimate setting. Where not the arrangments are the most important and the number of violins but the songs themselfs and the delivery of emotions.So I would recommend you buy the Broadway Album or any other Streisand Album for that matter instead of the Movie Album.
2,SO SAD!,"I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER GREAT STREISAND PERFORMANCE SINCE I HAVE BEEN A HUGE FAN THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. I GAVE THIS CD 2 STARS JUST FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE. I DISAGREE WITH MOST OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS REGARDING THEIR POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT HER VOICE. SONG SELECTIONS ASIDE, HER VOICE HAS DETERIORATED AND ONE NEED ONLY TO BREAK OUT AND LISTEN AGAIN TO ONE OF HER OLD ALBUMS. HER ""THIRD ALBUM"" IS MY FAV AND IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER PRODUCED BY ANYONE.PERHAPS THIS IS A CASE OF....IF YOU DON'T USE IT, YOU LOSE IT. I SINCERELY HOPE BARBRA MAKES A MUSICAL COMEBACK SOON. THIS IS NOT THE ONE."
4,Barbra's Grammy Year and More Gold albums then Any Female,"Yes, this massively talented artist is still wowing us with her talent and vision.The Movie Album is her best album since The Broadway Album. And now she has been certified to have more GOLD and PLATINUM albums then ANY other female artist--ever!Remember fans: the ""birds"" pick ONLY at the juciest (talented) grapes. Barbra is talent and perserverance personified.Buy The Movie album. It's really, truly wonderful."
1,Movie Songs to fall asleep by,"Sorry Barbra, I think you made this CD after your overnight visit with Bill in the White House! Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I am falling asleep just listening to the clips of each song. They are not necessarily bad songs as some reviewers have said. The voice is familiar and soothing and I don't see the dramatic differences as I do in her current Live 2006 CD. Even in the Somewhere with Il Divo video her voice strains is not the same as it was.Hopefully this is the year of your final, final, final comeback. We have enough material over the last 40 years to keep us busy for the next 40 years!"

5,best not by george lucas star wars book!,this book is the best! Its got the best villan the grand admiral thrawn and the story is so full of climaxes it will blow you away!
1,It is not that great.,"Zahn didn't put enough descriptions in the book. He never really describes the settings in the book, and while you are supposed to use your imagination while reading a book, describing the setting would have made the action scenes more interesting. I also had a problem with Luke giving Leia a lightsaber that he made for her. That is clearly not the Jedi way. She should make her own lightsaber when she is ready. Then, there is the boring dialogue. Everyone always says ""Point"" and ""Agreed"". Why?? Can't anyone say, ""You have a point there"" or ""I agree with you""? I also have a problem with Ackbar on the New Republic Council. If he is an Admiral, why is he on a civilian council? I didn't like Zahn's choices of weird names, like ""ysalamiri"" or the planet ""Bpfassh"" (how do you pronounce those?), Lando's ""Necr'ygor Omic wine"" and ""Fey'lya"". Why so many apostrophes? All in all, the book just isn't that great."
1,"Would be 0 starts, except it is Star Wars, after all","This was a BAD book. I love Star Wars, and wanted to hear more about the characters. But, I'm certainly not going to waste my time on any more books by Timothy Zahn. BORING, unbelievable story. I skipped through the entire last half, just looking for anything mildly interesting. I can't believe how many good reviews this book got.This was my first try at a non-Lucas SW book (I've been afraid they might be awful). I'll try one more author, but I'm not all that optimistic . By the way, did anyone remember that there was tons of humor in the Star Wars trilogy? Where did it go? I saw a couple possible attempts, but they were flat and forced. I don't think Mr. Zahn is someone I would enjoy knowning."
3,"Decent, but hardly great sci-fi","I was hoping that Zahn had managed to write some good, mature Star Wars books, but was dissapointed that it was just more mediocre writing and plot development wrapped up in the Star Wars universe. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is simplistic and relies on amazing coincidence to advance.Nothing really special here, and I doubt I will bother reading the other two books in the series."
2,If you loved the movies -- AVOID THIS SERIES!!,"HELLO!!! In Return of the Jedi, I was under the impression that the empire (the emperor, the death star, command ships, etc.) was destroyed. And now, what the heck? It's still around?! For crying out loud- this is a little far-fetched.There was good action and suspense. However, this series is pale in comparison to episodes IV-VI.By the way-- HOW ON EARTH did the Japanese word 'Katana' [sword] end up ""long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away""??!!"
5,I couldn't put the book down,"It was exciting. It was fun to read. There's no boring parts, and its a great read for ages 11 and up, with a good vocabulary. If you didn't know there was going to be books after it, it was hard to tell how the book would turn out. Over all it was a great book!"
3,good story...horrible copy of the actual paperbacks,"I have this trilogy in paperback ....and love the story. Having said that, the transcription from book to e-book is horrible. Mass mispellings, many parts of certain chapters weren'tseperated and ran back to back. It's almost as if it was typed by a 14 yr old who can't even proofread his/her own work. Half the time you can tell words were misspelled because the autocorrection completely changes the word from the original. If you have a tablet, get this trilogy on a different e-reader program."
3,"Villain, Thrawn, unrealisticallly knows all via alien art.",A well-intended sequel lacking the personality of Shadows of the Empire by Steve Perry. Zahn seems to rudely disregard C3PO rather than use him to his advantage. Grand Admiral Thrawn's most threatening characteristic is his uncanny ablility to know every move against him through the study of alien art
2,Completely Devoid of Any Star Wars Magic,"I just finished The Thrawn Trilogy, and I agree very much with what I've read in the 1-star and 2-star reviews. This trilogy was nothing at all like the original Star Wars movies. I forced myself to read the 1,400 pages, just so I could say I read it and know I gave it a chance. The familiar characters -- Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, Chewie, and the droids -- had no real life to them, not very much personality at all. And the new characters -- Thrawn, Paelleon, Mara, Karrde, and C'baoth -- were really boring. I felt no attachment whatsoever to any of them. And most important of all, there was absolutely no mythological layer to the entire story, which is what the magic of the original Star Wars is all about. I honestly would not recommend The Thrawn Trilogy to anyone. If you want to read a good Star Wars novel, read Steve Perry's Shadows of the Empire."
3,SPOILER BELOW!,"This only gets 3 stars from me because I can't stand MYRA JADE! How Luke can tolerate a woman who was the Emperor's student, much less marry her, is beyond me! Besides, whatever happened to the rule that Jedi couldn't marry?"
5,Wonderful,"A great book for Star Wars fans. I couldn't put it down. Zhan, along with Stackpole and Crispin, should be writing all the SW books. Deep characters, interesting plot twists, and well-conceived worlds (Unlike those of, say, Kevin J. Anderson). An all-around superb effort."
5,Convenient,"My husband and daughter really enjoy this soup. I like how convenient it is for them to grab, heat up, and eat."
1,Misleading Advertising,"I bought these because they advertise this as 100 calories per serving. Well, there are almost two servings in a bowl which puts this at roughly 200 calories and 40 fat calories. Plus, the chichen has lots of chewy parts that I typically would cut off if I were eating a whole breast. This is very high in sodium also...close to 900 mgs in total. This is anything but a healthy bowl of soup. If you are going to sell food in a single serving size, you should only be serving a single serving. I am so disapointed that I am actually going to take this product back to the grocery store and get my money back - something that I NEVER do."
2,Huge price increase!,"This is great soup but not worth $2.77 a bowl. I bought 2 cases because the price was so good, Walmart was the only place that I found it for less but Amazon delivers to my door. I paid $18.00 per case of 12 on 12/10/11, today when I went to reorder the price had jumped to $33.21! Almost double in a little over a month. I won't be ordering at this price, it's back to driving to Walmart or finding another soup for my lunch."
3,Synopsis,"A civilian researcher working at the NASA space track station observes and records signals coming from planet ""Serius B."" His discovery materializes into a huge blazing fireball that attempts to make contact with him. This results in a government cover-up and a visit from the aliens."
5,Scoop perfection,"I rarely see an item with so many reviews and yet nothing less than five stars. Believe me, this scoop earns and deserves every star. I bought mine in Europe, but since then this has been popping up everywhere, including on Good Eats (for you Alton Brown fans). I've had the teflon scoops, the heat-retaining scoops, the toothed scoop, the spade, and a couple of dishers (where the arm sweeps the cup, which intuitively seems to be the best - but isn't). Nothing removes ice-cream that has been frozen hard, the way this scoop does. And it's built like a rock. Forget the twist-scooping action, just ram it into the ice-cream, twist and get a scoop. Put the rest of your ice-cream back in the freezer while users of other scoops are still letting it soften, or microwaving it, or trying other ways to compensate for their inferior scoops. No politeness here. Your other scoops do not measure up to this one."
1,Sheds Metal,"Great weight and ergonomics. Digs well into hard frozen ice cream. The problem is the scoop began to degrade, pit and lose it's metal coating, revealing a darker metal under the coating. Zyliss replaced the scoop under warranty, w/o any problems. When I received the new scoop, I stopped putting it into the dishwasher, but now, about 9 months later, it is degrading even worse than the original. This is not just an aesthetic problem as it begs the question, what types of metal alloys or coatings are we possibly ingesting and what are the health impacts. Put simply, you shouldn't have to think so much about an ice cream scoop. This product should be recalled.<<<UPDATE>>>Zyliss replaced the replacement product w/o any hassle. I now leave scoop #3 it in the drawer where it seems to do fine. And no, there is no problem with my water or soap. This has not happened to anything else here."
2,d,"I have had this scooper for about three years now. It was great for about the first 8-12 months, then the coating in the scoop starting to pit. I still use it, since I have not bought anything else. I like how it scoops and the ice cream does not stick too bad to it, but I don't like the pitting of the scoop.I gave it a two, since the finish in the scoop is junk and is coming off. If it was not pitting, I would have given it a 5 star."
1,Has issues in Linux.,"I bought this case to use with MythTV, specifically the MythBuntu distro. I found that setting up the LCD on the front with linux was as easy as installing the lcdproc package and selecting 'Enable LCD support' within Myth. The remote was a little tricky to get rid of repeat button presses but after running irrecord a few times and fiddling with the settings all is well.UPDATE: All is not well in Linux with this case. I do NOT recommend using this for a HTPC. The support for this LCD(VFD) and Remote Control is really buggy.BEWARE.And the fans are REALLY loud."
1,Amazon's terrible shipping service,"First of all, I love this product and would give five stars. Works like a charm for poopy cloth diapers!The only reason I gave one star is because Amazon's shipping service was terrible. It was arrived damaged and leaked heavily. Some bottles were even half empty!!! My carpet got the strong Bac-Out smell for days.I noticed the caps were loosen, so I told Amazon to open the original box to tighten them if necessary before they pack it in their Amazon box! But I guess they never did.Amazon tried to replace it TWICE, and no success. I never got the product simply because they were damaged on the way and returned to Amazon, then it was out of stock so Amazon had to refund the money. This whole process took me 1 month. Could have bought it from other store if I knew this will happen!"
5,Great for those cloth diaper smells...,"I was using the Bumgenius Odor Remover to stop the odor from my Bumgenius cloth diapers. While it worked great, it was very expensive...I read about this stuff and LOVE IT! I do spray a little more than the Bumgenius Odor Remover on my diapers, but this stuff is still much much much cheaper and works great. Plus, it can be used for other household purposes. You can't beat eco-friendly products that work well."
1,Ineffective--leaves unpleasant citric odor,Got it for a stubborn cat urine carpet mess. All that happened was the kittee pee smell is now merged with the sharp and unpleasant citric smell of the product. It failed to work at all. Very disappointed.
4,fun game,this is a very fun game lots of tricks hard to do juggling tricks but still fun and also not enough tricks but still fun great game i recommend for any soccer fan. a few fun modes such as skill challenge witch is really just juggling with tricks and career which is ok.
1,again i have bought many dvds this was a total flub,reggae rockers this was also a total waste of money quality and content were absent I find it hard to qualify atall!!!
3,expensive for little fun,My little boy recieved this from Santa.Definitely not like the commericials. Had difficulty with the lights working and pieces fitting back together.He 6 and the adults played with it more.
3,A good read,"This was an exciting story except the only problem I found was the main character was just to perfect, he had no flaws whatsoever."
5,Good little book about some bad little bats.,"I have read this book and it is not one that leaves the reader saying ""boy the infomercials are looking real good now"". If you want a book with some plain old fashion guy and a gal verses the monster, then this is it. It's a fun read and would make a great movie, especially the elevator scene. Read it for the fun of a good scare."
5,Great book!,"All these sci-fi fans are dissing this book, but this book isn't suppose to be sci-fi... it's supposed to be fictional horror, and Jeff Rovin does a great job with it! I can't wait to see the movie!"
1,I WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS GOT PUBLISHED,"I've read a book a week. I've read bad novels, good novels. But this...oh how much worse could it get?! I hate reading negetive reviews, I always feel bad for the author. They put so much into a book, but this should have gone in the NY garbage! I figured it would be fun to read since we have bata around my house. I watch them at dusk flying eraticly. I even had one flying six inches or so one night over my pool. While I sat out reading this, I couldn't help buit find myself getting very bord. Not a good book. Story line is a little too much! Giant bat kills NYC! Oh you think there could be a chance! We can only hope!!!"
3,Did not ship well.,"Taps & dies arrived out of place in case, which lead to some dings in the set. Irwin needs a case that will stand up to the punishment of shipping."
1,Want a Weird Snore-fest? Look No Further.....,"The cover is deceiving,..the dialog on the back as well, as they make the book look/sound interesting when nothing could be further from the truth.I found the story of Elmo Land, the last living vampire to be one of the most lackluster, uninteresting, and frustratingly boring books I have read in a very very long time.Being the completest that I am I had to stick around to the very last page in the dire hope that somewhere, somehow, this plodding mess of a tale would get better...even a little. It didn't...it got worse.The ending was a complete let down and when I had finished reading it I was so frustrated that I tore the damned thing in half! Someone who had seen the remains in the trash asked me, ""Bad day?""""No"", I replied, ""bad book.""If you're looking for a fun and engaging vampire story,...keep walking.If you're looking for a plodding, pile of drivel...look no further."
2,Tough to belt up,"This holster is of good quality and adjustable. But the adjustment strap resides in the belt loop. Thus, feeding a belt through the loop is really tough. I would not buy this holster again."
4,Incognito (Eleven),I love this CD and the first is what made me a Incognito fan. I now have 5 CD's by this group.
1,What?,"I thought it was great until they turned it into a sex act for kids. I mean really, groping a girl in the middle of a long tradition of innocence? Am I the only one outraged? I hesitate writing this thinking surely that isn't what I saw and surely people wouldn't be giving it 4 and 5 stars, but it is what I saw. How could you?"
2,Funny aftertaste,I bought a couple different types of the Healthy Choice Soup and the Chicken Nookle has an aftertaste that I dont like. The others are fine but I would not reorder the chicken noodle.
3,convenient,The soup is a little watery but it is convenient when you are in a hurry. Fair value when purchased during a promotion.
2,Malfunction,"There two major problems with this watch. One, Auto-atomic setting do not work as described in manual. Second, Unable to even set time using good old fashion manual way. Returned to Casio for repair, hope they get it right."
4,"A disfigured man, a beautiful heiress, a spoiled cousin...","What a combination! And Jamie has been hired by the heiress' father to escort them to her betroth's homeland. What a trip! In the meantime, Jamie's sisters have put the pressure on Jamie to turn the heiress' head and capture her heart (rather her money) in matrimony because the family is broke! Feeling responsible- Jamie sets out to do so- not realizing that Axia (the heiress) has traded places with her cousin, Frances, so she can experience freedom and life it's self before she is tied down in marriage. So the whole time Jamie is ""wooing"" her- he is courting the wrong woman. And Axia falls for Jamie but is unable to tell him without revealing her position. There is a little bit of everything in this book - adventure, romance, surprise, entertainment, etc. Truly worth reading - it's a good read!"
3,Very Tedious Reading,"I am a huge fan of Deveraux's. This book seemed to be something she wrote as an afterthought. The beginning of book shows promise, but as the pages are turned, the torture begins. I couldn't wait to finish it just so that I could begin another book."
2,Offensive review,"Mr Barbieri is clearly unfamiliar with my work and also with this particular edition in which I discuss the problems I had with including the rape in the penultimate chapter. From the beginning of my career I have been writing some form of moral fable and I am also on record for my support of feminists, many of whom are close personal friends (indeed, I'm married to one). I have written a great deal about sexual and domestic abuse, with particular attention to pornography as justification for rape. It is unsophisticated at best to take one of my fables, which shows how imperial power is maintained by hypocrisy and crime, and fail to understand it for what it is. I can only assume that Mr Barbieri has been offended by the polemic of my critical study Wizardry and Wild Romance which takes issue with the moral attitudes to be discovered in the likes of Tolkien and Lewis. I have no problem with morality, but I believe I have a right to disagree with another writer's moral intentions."
4,Zyliss Equals Quality....,"I like the curve of the swivel peeler. It works just fine, althhough it takes a little getting used to. Zyliss is synonomous with quality. Recommend this product."
3,"Not bad, but I was expecting more",Things I like about this DVD:1. It shows you dance and body movements from basics to more advanced styling technique.2. Good contents.Things that I think can be improved:1. The instructor is facing you the whole time. It's hard to mimic the moves and steps when she is the opposite of you. It would be great to film her from her back so it's easier to see exactly what the steps are.2. The voice recording isn't very good. There are times when I can hear her pretty well but other times I had to turn up the volume in order to hear her voice clearly.3. I feel that the spinning techniques can be elaborated more. She showed all kinds of spins in salsa but did not really get into the details of how to practice and perfect your spin.
2,Creamy...but not worth it.,"I couldn't wait to try this lotion, since I usually love Nivea's products...but I was let down. Josh bought this for me, and it's a good lotion, but not worth the money they want for it. I have moved onto a much better lotion, and I reccomend you skip this one, atleast until the price comes down."
4,Great for daughters 8 & 6 years old!,"My daughters always wanted to put a towel on their hair ""like mom"" but the towels were too big and always fell off. These are PERFECT, they hold all their hair, which is long, and stay on their head! The towel is very absorbent, their hair is not dripping all over like it used to be. The button is a little hard for them to do themselves, but overall this is a wonderful product!"
4,"Would have given this five stars, but...","I love this towel. This is my third microfiber-type hair turban (this is my first Aquis purchase) and this is, by far, the best I have used. The other two towels promised drier hair and they were ""okay."" This towel really does dry hair faster, thus reducing blow dryer time. I gave it only four stars because of the button. It was not attached well and I had to sew it back on after only three uses. Otherwise, I would have given this a 5-star rating."
1,"A little difficult to attach and is a tight fit, but dries hair well.","UPDATE: After posting a question on a forum [...], I was told how to attach it. The fit was still rather tight, which is odd because my hair is not that long. The towel, which I also bought, fits better.The material wicks away moisture while perserving curls.I just tried it for the first time and couldn't hook the button after three or four tries. The towel dries well, but all the struggling to find the button and loop only roughed up my hair, which is exactly what a curly-haired person wants to avoid because it creates frizz. I hope I don't have to wet my hair all over again.I'll try a few more times. If things get better, I'll update my review. If they don't, back it goes."
1,"Terrible product, impossible to use!","I should have read the reviews BEFORE I went and bought this item! You will have to guess how to apply this turban to your head because the picture is quite vague. However, the key is to stretch it, then twist it, and then button int he back. This doesn't work, because the item is EXTREMELY SMALL. I have thin medium-length hair btw so I cannot imagine who this product would be useful for, except possibly a very small child.I wrote to the company to inform them I was VERY disappointed. I am glad however I bought one first, before getting one for a gift!"
3,Get what you pay for.,"I don't have a huge, constant need for files- so I bought cheap ones. One of the handles is not secured properly to the actual file- so there's some give. I didn't care too much until I tried to use it. That was fairly annoying.But... the chances of one of your files being loose as well is minimal- so if you need fairly cheap files, 11 bucks isn't too bad. If you're really going to use these things- look elsewhere and spend more money."
4,really nice!!!,really nice watch one of the 4 watches i ordered for my husband & gotta say he's gonna b super excited 2 have 4 gorgeous g-shock watches. i whould recomend 2 a friend for sure.
4,sir leapsalot review,"i love the theme of this item because its not just for a little girl or boy.. It can be used for both, Also the quality of this item exceeded my expectations"
2,Not like Wendy Bellissimo...,"I've been a big fan of Wendy Bellissimo and bought a crib set from her line for my first child. I had intended on purchasing a second set for the child I'm expecting, but unfortunately she quit offering the custom designed products and instead started making mass-produced, cheaper items in only four different patterns. While the quality of these sets is better than the other sets you'd find at Babies r' us, it's not even close to the old Wendy Bellissimo standard and I'm hugely disappointed."
3,2princessesmom,"My 4 year old got this for her birthday and was so totally excited to use it-(I myself am picture happy-video camera, 35 mm and digital camera) She wanted to take after me-she used it for about a couple of weeks and was very careful with it(the kids got moms good eye for picture taking)-but then the button got stuck and we had to jimmy it to come out-then we loaded film in one day and it just decided to stop working-tried new batteries, reloading the film-nothing worked-turned into recycling material. I dont really recommend this paoduct-all you will find is a rather unhappy, frustrated little girl who is looking for you to fix the problem."
1,Strawberry Caca Camera,"Don't waste your hard earned cash on this cheap, flimsy camera, it is totally crapola. My daughter was so excited when she received it and equally as disappointed when the silly camera couldn't even load the film! It has a ridiculous wind up mechanism that just seemed ODD and didn't even work. The instructions weren't helpful and even my husband who is "" Mr Fix It"" couldn't get it to work!! What a waste of money and huge let down. Caca."
2,Live...Not Studio Recordings! Bummer...,These are live tracks...not the original studio recordings or radio edits. Feel very misled. Didn't listen to the previews (my fault -- that's why I gave it two stars instead of one but NOTHING indicated this was s live album. Knew it was to good to be true. Would be AMAZING if these were the original recordings. Oh well...
1,"Cheap, slow, and loud","The speakers blew out after 2 days, the fan is obnoxiously loud, and the speed is incredibly slow for a 2.4gh because of the slow system bus. The only good thing about this computer is the 60gig hard drive and integrated 802.11b. After a week I took it back and got a Sony GRZ630. The Sony is twice as fast with a quarter of the noise. The Sony also got better framerates in games even though the Sony only has 32MB of video, likely because it's a faster card, and I'm able to play music loud without blowing out the speakers. You can buy a 802.11b card from Sony that doesn't stick out. Its better off anyways when the 802.11b is outdated at least it won't be ""integrated"" into my notebook. Plus the Sony is much thinner than the Compaq.I'm much happier with the Sony."
5,One of my favorites,"I don't typically choose fruity teas, but this is one of my favorites. Many of my family members love it."
2,"Poor shippoing, arrived damaged",I bought this as a gift for the holidays for someone who loves soaps.Part of the appeal of this was that the image above shows a charmingly designed box.However the seller placed the box in a padded envelope so it arrived crunched and in poor condition.I could not give it as a present because the box was all caved in and looked like it had been sat on.The seller needs to not send this item in a soft padded envelope.
3,Fire Woman: Tribute to the Cult,"You get what you ask for. I asked my wife to get me this CD for my birthday and I got it. I couldn't help it. When I saw the names Jake E. Lee and Enuff 'Z' Nuff, I had to have it. Jake's solo on ""American Horse"" almost does it for me. Mesmerizing. Enuff 'Z' Nuff satisfies also. Unfortunately, the other ""tributes"" fall short of hard rock glory. With all the technical advances lately, you'd think these guys could remake the Cult's songs and make them sound outstanding. It seems like they just follow the basic roadmap and use their own fake raspy voices, never coming close to Ian's prowess. I'll keep it, though. The Cult deserves a tribute. Check out The Doors of the 21st Century, L.A. Woman Live! (D21C) Ian Astbury fills Morrison's role."
5,Fabulous book,"I'm a career piano teacher with a doctorate in music, and I adore this book. It has such a perfect combination of pieces that it's worth as many as five or six books all by itself. It has Bach Minuets, Mozart Minuets, Beethoven and Haydn German Dances, selections from Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Bartok, Kabalevsky....it's a wonderful cross section of the best literature. If your student has finished with the pedagogical ""starter"" repertoire and is ready for his/her first real classical pieces from the canon of repertoire, this is the book for that stage of development. Many books try to accomplish this task but end up being dreary with boring selections. All the selections in this one are beautiful and enjoyable."
1,NOT HAPPY,THIS WAS NOT WHAT I RCVD. I WANTED MOTORCYCLES AND I RCVD BIKE CYCLES. NOT HAPPY AT ALL IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT THANKS FOR NOTHING.....
2,Some going points but not easy to get.,"Ms Steinem seemed reluctant to write this book. I was confused by her writing style and her disorganized thoughts and facts. I struggled to finish this book hoping it would get better, but it never did."
5,A+ reading.,"This book was my introduction to Gloria Steinem and the beginning of some serious hero-worship. Several of the articles in the book were published before I was even born, and even the ones that weren't are over a decade old now. Amazing--disturbing, too--that so many of the problems and issues she writes about are still realities. However, Steinem has a way of analysing these things with such intelligence and articulating what seems inexpressible, that you finish each essay thinking, at the very least, ""Well, thank god."" This book is half-history and half-inspiration. She's a great journalist and an awesome activist."
5,Just great,"I'm not crazy about essays, but the title got my attention, so I bought this book. I had the best time reading it; it's really clever, sometimes sad, definitely wry, and wonderfully written; with some of the essays I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. Most of them are touching, others are plain hilarious (everyone should read ""If Men Could Menstruate"", I laughed until the walls rattled)."
2,disappointed,"I chose this book for my grade eight class to tie in with some study of slavery and the Underground Railway. My students were captivated by the descriptions of plantation life and the hardships of slaves. We all were baffled, however, when the story took a science fiction turn. We probably would have accepted some sort of time travel connection, but the little glowing multi-coloured aliens and an intergalactic battle between good and evil was just too much. My students agreed that a simpler, less outlandish story line would have been much better."
3,It should have been so much better,"Although a fair attempt to get inside the mindset of G.A.C., this book ultimately fails to deliver the thrills or tension it should have. The biggest downer is that this was written by the author of the excellent 'Dances with Wolves'. As a fictional account of Custer's diary, the book is tied by the fact that there is no reference to the Battle of the Little Big Horn and this also leaves the reader with a sense of unfinished business. Rumours are that the screen rights for this book have been bought by Oliver Stone. I would recommend Oliver and any other interested reader to acquire 'A road we do not know'. It's a far more exciting read."
5,Aimee: Life of Aimee Semple McPherson,The book was in very good condition better than I expected the seller was great and stayed in contact till I recieved the book
2,Did not care for this stroller,"I was very excited about purchasing this stroller after reading the positive reviews...only to be disappointed. My baby is 2mos old & we have been using a Snap & Go (which I LOVE)...but needed a more substantial stroller for walks outside, etc. When using this stroller outside it rattled, the handles felt loose, & was a bumpy ride. I felt that for the price it should have felt sturdier & smoother on the pavement. The basket is a PAIN...unable to access it from the back, & from the front you can't even fit a medium sized diaper bag, or much of anything else into it. I was unable to steer this stroller one handed which also bothered me. I returned this stroller & purchased the Graco Quattro (for outdoor use) for a fraction of the cost and I am thrilled with it! I plan to purchase a lightweight stroller for trips to the mall. I will spend less on the 2 new strollers together than I did on the Pliko."
4,Very nice quality; color not true,"I ordered the Sienna Nautica Highland duvet cover. Although I was very pleased with the quality of the item, I was disappointed in the sienna color and felt that it was not as pictured. I was expecting the sienna to be more on the rust side of the color spectrum. However, it is actually more of a peach shade of sienna. Other than that, the cover was very well made with the fabric actually being pieced together instead of just being printed with the different striped colors. Also, the quality of the fabric was excellent and had a very nice feel to it. Overall, I would recommend this product."
1,DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!,This is a horrible movie! Worst I've seen in a long time! The acting is painful to watch and listen to! God awful movie! It's as if someone walked down the street and grabbed people randomly with no acting experience or skill whatsoever! There was literally no plot! God awful movie! I love movies. I love independent movies! But this was hideous! I want my money back for this order!!!
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I bought this computer about a year and a half ago. It worked great at first. After a few months of basic use, it began running LOUDER and slower. The mouse touch pad doesn't work properly and when I type, some letters don't register. I have to keep backing up and retyping words. The battery died after 13 months. I have used many utility programs to try and resolve some of these issues but to no avail."
5,Accept no imitations,"Great product, I've heard nothing but horror stories from people that have tried to save a buck of two on a cheaper hydration system. I am very happy with this product.If you're looking for one then get a CamelBak of a Penguin."
4,Great Hydrator,"I have used this pack on several hikes and it does just what I want it to. Holds 1.5 liters which is good for a 3 hour desert hike. I have run out of water before(with this pack) when it's 100+. It has space for a phone, wallet, keys, and a snack. The space gets limited when the bladder is full though. It sure beats carrying a bigger backpack with water bottles rolling around inside. I would not recommend this pack for an all day hike."
2,Ok,"I am new to the bo staff, but this foam bo does not give the appropriate feel to the user. It bends too easily and holds a curved shape. The inside seems to be plastic. I do not recommend this for anyone. Buy a wooden staff and get use to bruises."
1,Swindled,"This product is MKP-O5-600 which is also sold directly through Amazon for $28.98. Great product, I ordered this through Amazon directly and got what I ordered. I ordered through the Amazon connection Faye Myers Motorcycle World (from the Amazon site), thinking I was ordering a different model as the discription and price ($35.96) is varied, and got the same product. We wanted two sets, but had I known I was getting the same product, I would have ordered the same product directly from Amazon and not been swindled."
5,awesome read,I enjoyed this book very much. So much so that I had to read all the books in the series...
5,I LOVE THIS GIRL!!!,it's amazing enough said. I don't speak japanese but i listen to a lot of their music and I have never heard anyone like her.
3,Illinois is somewhat better than boring,"The author is (properly) defensive about his state's lack of scenic wonders. For a fact, any random square mile of Utah probably will have more visible, interesting geology than the entire state of Illinois. That being said, Mr. Wiggers manages to make what geology there is fairly intersting. I think this book would be ideal for someone who lives in Illinois. He provides thirty-seven sites spread thoughout the state that could be visited on a day or weekend trip and teach you a lot about your state you probably didn't know."
1,Bad news,"I admire many British crime writers for their subtle, complex plotting and fine writing. This author is an exception. Don't be fooled by Lee Child's inexplicable endorsement."
2,Lee Child dudded me,I really struggled to finish this book and had to skip pages to see how the plot ended. Really amateur writing and trying too hard. stupid stuff like the copper leaves the villian alone with the hero so he confesses. Too much thinking by the hero who is partially tough. I definately will not buy any more of these books and would not recommend. I should have trusted my instincts after reading the sample but I went with what Lee Child wrote - he owes me AUD$3.90
2,DON'T DO IT!!!!,"Do not believe the Lee Child endorsement of this book. It must be a paid endorsement or they must work for the same publishing company, because this book is not good. I found the story to be kind of hokey and predictable."
3,Yanni Live at the Acropolis,"I have bought (2) copies of this video prior and both have been ""borrowed"". This copy I'm putting under lock and key. The music and performance is excellent and it would seem that anyone who likes Yanni wants to have this video...would highly recommend"
3,quiet and effective,"it's been filtering my living room quite nicely. clean filter once per two weeks and got quite a cloak of dust. only wish it has 3 fan settings; high speed is a tiny bit loud, and better to have filter air going up the ceiling. overall, good buy."
3,It is Quiet while it cleans,"As an allergy sufferer I appreciate having air purifiers in the house to clean the dust, dander and other allergens from my breathing space. This honeywell quietclean is one of the best products on the market. It is quiet while the motor runs and is very good at it's job of purifying air."
3,This product uses an ionizer.,"I have just received this product and will make not comment yet about its function or efficacy.I will note, however, that the HFD-010 does use an ionizer as part of its filtration mechanism and might therefore be inappropriate for some highly sensitive people with asthma or other breathing disorders.Honeywell's packaging does mention the ionizer, but the product marketing as presented on Amazon does not.The user reviews also appear not to mention the ionizer, so I add this review simply to provide this information.Three stars for now with deductions for difficult-to-find product data. I might bump up to 4 or 5 stars anyway if the unit solves my immediate allergen problems."
3,Not so quiet!,"Bought it because it's supposed to be quiet.After all it's called ""QuietClean"".Well,it's loud on low speed.It only has 2 speeds.The High speed is very loud,kind of expected.But the low speed is too loud,I put it in the dinig room and I can still hear it in the living room with the TV on.It does a good job cleaning the air,loudly!"
5,Great Air Purifier! Compact and Quiet!,"This air purifier is great for small rooms. It has two speed settings and is very quiet. The ""pre-filter"" is easy to clean."
3,Quaint but outdated,"I got this book as a gift from my 62 year old aunt. Offers dated advice (Discos are good for dancing, but not to get to know a date). Silly and unpractical, but good if for nothing else than a shallow look at how things were."
4,This was a summer read for me in 1970,"I was a very shy and self-conscious teenager and even after I read this book, I did not get a teenage boy, but I do remember picking up some tips from the book just about how to feel better in my own skin and helped me with feeling a little more confident.It might not help, but it certainly won't hurt."
3,Cost effective for Cell Phone pictures,I don't send emails from my cell phone and I couldn't download photos I had taken without signing up for their multimedia package. So this card reader takes the micro transflash chip from the cell phone and allows me to download my photos. It can be a little finicky at times if you don't use the same USB port.
4,really good,Um...well this album ROCKS!!! But as said by some others I thought that they were gonna ROCK WORSHIP LIKE ITS NEVER BEEN ROCKED BEFORE!!! but it was alittle less than What I was Expecting track three and seven are probly the best in my opinion never the less I give this album 4 stars because there heart is in the right place and this album is still good
4,Kutless,Very good Christian rock album. LIked the mixture of worship songs and more rock-oriented songs.
3,Mediocre,"I really enjoy Kutless, and some bands do praise and worship music well. This effort is bland, repetitive, and certainly nowhere near the power of Kutless' first two albums. I expected a praise and worship album from Kutless to take tired church songs and make them rock. Instead, the songs sapped all the rock out of the band."
2,Liked first two cds better,"I ran across Kutless by accident, while surfing. I bought the first two cds and really enjoyed them. This is only my personal opinion, but this one was just too mellow for my taste. Its like the band was on tranquilizers. I realize it's just the style of the songs, but the first two cds really rocked compared to this one."
5,Glamour and Glitz is David's Calling...,"Not many photographers can put together the camp, kitsch, gloss and lustre that this man can. Even the gaudiest of pictures can envelope you mind's taste buds... Its beautiful, erotic and camp at its best!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"This book completely blew me away, it was so brilliantly written. The author is a master of suspense, and his method for intertwining the main character's tender past with the murder plot was extremely compelling. I'm a voracious reader and read across all genres -- romance, mystery, suspense, fantasy and science fiction -- and I have to say this is the most remarkable example of the thriller genre that I've read in years. Plus the bonus of Mark's talent for creating vivid imagery is unsurpassed.It's difficult to find any book worth reading these days, and I usually toss them aside after the first five or six chapters (if I even get that far). But Mark is a step above the average author. He's now one of the few authors on my ""must buy!"" list. I highly, highly recommend this novel!"
2,good beginning - anticlimatic ending,"The first 200 pages of this book had me on the ""edge of my seat"". The combination of mystery and almost-horror genre was excellent and the pace was just right. Diana's struggles and relationships with both the ""hunt"" and the others were actually easy to relate to. Unfortunately, the story fell apart in the latter pages with a very weak ending. The reliance on the ""power"" and the mystical strength of both Diana and the antagonist were just a bit much for me. The book moved from a credible human suspense with believable characters and action to a superhuman or supernatural non-thriller by the end. By the time the climax occurred, I cared little about who won or whether I read the rest of the book. Sullivan also spent very little time on characterization of other players in the book...only the painfully long descriptions of Diana's past. This book reminded much of Congo...great start...poor finish."
5,Definately one of the best stories of all time!,T. A. Barron brings to life the tale of a young boy on his journey to man hood that will make him the best wizard of all time.
2,"No Originality, Baron has let us down.","The lost years of merlin, TA Baron's first book in the lost years of merlin series, shows no originality or imagination. All ideas were taken from other sources, except the magical land of Fincayra. it shows a startly similarity to the books of Lyod Alexander, more presiscely his Pyridian chronicles. The entire plot was taken from another series of books. I reccomend you read the pyridian chronicles and see for your self."
4,Easy Enough,"I bought this used as Pokemon Link!, which is the same game.The concept of the game is easy enough. Mach 4 Pokemon in a row.The only downside to this game is that the difficulties change quite abruptly.It starts out very simple, and gets difficult at a quick pace.It might take a lot of time, practice, and frustration to beat this game."
5,Gary Numan excels,"Haunting melodies and alternately disturbing and soothing lyrics bring the listener of this magical artist to heights only dreamed of by the self proclaimed ""goth rockers.""Some artists are simply, purely masters of their game.B.W./author/Labyrinth of Chaos"
2,Not heavy duty at all,"I broke my pair cutting a chicken apart. They are hard to hold especially with greasy hands, they don't open wide enough and the curved part of the blade that is used for gripping a chicken bone is too thin that's where it broke on me. I really like Zyliss products but they need to go back to the drawing board on these. If you are cutting paper these are great."
1,Poorly Built...Go for something else!,"Do not fall for this organizer's value, you are getting nothing out of it. I have had numerous problems with it, not caused by me or my computer, but the way it was programmed to run. Whenever you are typing a message, you can only put 100 characters! The screen flickers and flashes whenever you type, and it is a disaster for all the fast typers of the world, YOU HAVE TO PUNCH THE KEYS JUST TO GET IT TO WORK! The next time someone talks to ROYAL, ask one of them if they ever heard of a backspace button. The simplist task of just deleting a letter requires you to press the < button and then hit delete or overwrite it. Don't be fooled, this is not a good PDA."
1,You can do much better,"This 'toy' has too much and too little information. It splits into 2 sections, each of which has the parts of the brain labeled. The print is small and the words large. The color is much more vibrant on Amazon than it is in reality - it's very dull. It is neither a toy nor an educational device. I'd look further."
2,My hair fell out more than ever......,"I was so excited to get this product, that's until I put it on my head. My hair started falling out immediately, and I'm not talking about a couple hairs, I am talking about a brush full of hair. It scared me, I thought if I keep it on all night like it instructs you to do, that I would be bald the next morning, so I washed it out. It continued to fall out while rinsing it in the shower, the only thing that seemed to stop the hair from falling out after the rinse was the washing of head and shoulder shampoo on my scalp. Now I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I was told that Asian hair products are way too strong for Caucasian hair. Does any one know if this is true, because if that is the case that might have been why it didn't work for me. Does anyone know?"
3,Just Okay For Me,"This is a cozy mystery about Mavis, a widow I assume to be somewhere in her seventies. I liked Mavis and thought her character was well developed. However, the plot was lacking and parts didn't feel believable. While visiting a friend, Mavis stumbles upon a dead body. She sets out to solve the murder, with the help of her nephew. As these clues unraveled, I found it stretched credibility that they would have been overlooked by the police during an investigation. There were no surprises for me in this whodunit. The killer struck me as obvious, making it even less believable that the police would have been that incompetent to require an older woman to come in and solve their case."
2,cute shoes but not comfortable,"I usually wear 3"" high heels for work, so I think I can handle this pair. However, this pair of shoes have not arch support at all. My feet hurt after 15-20 mins. Though they look good, still not a good choice."
5,A fun way to learn a fun sport,"This gives good basics to art of telemark skiing. The cartoons are really fun and silly, making it an enjoyable read."
4,very good! what I needed,This product worked for what i needed to count coin without having to do it. I could see if you have large amount it would be a pain but for me it works like a charm.
2,Deja Vu,"Although i enjoyed the book the more i read the more i saw the similarities between this book and Sharon Bowers,Lucifer Rising....parts of it read like direct rip offs."
5,Where have you been Ronica Black?,"I'd never heard of her before? I took a chance on a new author because I wanted something new and different. The front and back covers hooked me and I wasn't disappointed.Her in-depth character development helps to make this a great book. You have to know what makes a character tick and some books are just to superficial.I love a book which covers many aspects: romance, drama, mystery, action, sex. Oh yeah!I enjoyed reading her debut novel. I hope to see more of Ms. Black. Her book is a great read and a keeper."
3,Fairly useful info,The only things I found useful for me was the setting up spooky things for you to familiarize the horse to. Gave me ideas on what and how to set up spooky stuff and how to get the horse used to it. The rest of the book was not interesting or very informative to me.
5,Great iPad Stand,"Since I purchased the iPad, I have been looking for an inexpensive stand to use at home, work, etc. This stand works great! It is sturdy and holds the iPad both vertically and horizontally. You are able to use the touchscreen, while it is resting on the stand. I purchased several, and I can place the iPad on the stand to show pictures, have a movie playing, etc. They are compact and fold easily. Good buy."
3,Not just casseroles...,"If you long for one-dish meals, this is your book! Casserole cooking fans will find many new recipes. An entire chapter is devoted to Casseroles & Oven Dinners.To put the book in perspective, it is not really just about one-dish meals. There are recipes for Soups, Stews, Stir-Fries, Main-Dish Salads, Pasta, Pies & Pizza, Sandwiches and Simple Desserts.The recipes in Best One-Dish were designed around ideas from comfort food. Pumpkin-Pot Stew is quite creative and would be appreciated in October! A section for Biscuits and Scones is appropriate to accompany the first chapter. Gingery Beef & Sugar Snaps can be made in under an hour, making it a quick supper. Valentines Sundaes look so romantic and frozen yogurt hearts are drizzled with ruby red raspberry sauce.They couldn't resist adding a tempting section for making cookies, although one would hope no one makes a meal out of them :)~The Rebecca Review"
2,Kindle Edition is Very Difficult to Use,"ProsThe recipes are easy and tasty, without too much reliance on soy products. I agree with the other positive reviews regarding the recipes themselves.ConsThe Kindle edition is nearly impossible to use. The table of contents only links to the chapters, not to the recipes themselves. Although there is a recipe listing, it does not link to the recipes - and of course the page numbers are no help since the Kindle uses locations instead of page numbers. So, the only way to get to the recipes is to search by the recipe title and then guess on which location points to the actual recipe. If I had known this edition was so poorly executed, I would have purchased the paperback edition instead."
2,"I love China, Chinese people, and Chinese food, but not worthless junk","I love China, Chinese people, and Chinese food, but not worthless junk. I actually bought Star Trek Voyager 1-7 from a seller and it turned out to be a Chinese bootleg set. I was so disappointed but the seller disappeared and I was stuck with a, not 2nd rate, but 5th rate quailty set. I should saved my money until Paramount dropped the price."
1,DO NOT BUY. This is an ILLEGAL version of Deep Space Nine.,The seller is lying to you. These are not official Chinese versions. China does not use Region 1 and China does not use NTSC. Do not support bootlegging. These are unauthorized bootlegs that nobody benefits from except the bootleggers who are selling you inferior quality products. Stick with the real versions.
2,Did not receive what I paid for.,"I paid for a new, never before used item, but received a used set. A few of the discs were even damaged. I am very disappointed."
1,Chinese Garbage,"This is a total rip-off. It's the Chinese version of the DVD set.This, like EVERYTHING that comes from China, is GARBAGE.That's right, EVERYTHING. They poison our children withoutconcern or conscience and hide behind the flimsy curtain ofpolitical correctness when they're called on it.CHOW-DONG, or whatever his name is, who gave the reviewabove is a liar. There is much more than just the last 30 sec.missing from each episode. All the discs freeze up at somepoint of each episode. None are even watchable.Do yourselves a favor and stay away fromas many Chinese products as possible."
4,DS9 Review,"Well, I'm an old school TOS fan, but DS9 comes in as my #2 star trek series. The acting is good. The special effects are top notch. There did seem to be an abundance of love stories though."
4,Very helpful...,"I wasn't very familiar with IS auditing until I read this book. The book was very helpful, explaining what IS Auditing was and how someone like me can get into the field. It covered many points in IS Auditing, including risks, controls, certifications, CAATTs, and IS careers. This book will be helpful to anyone that wishes to learn more about the topic."
3,Boring...poorly edited,"It's an IT book, so the topic is not exactly thrilling. The main issue with the book is how it has been so poorly edited. There are multiple sections in the text that literally repeat word for word from earlier sections, just makes the read that much worse when you realize you already read the same thing twice"
2,Don't Buy a Smartpad for a Palm IIIC!,"The Seiko Smartpad is advertised as working with all Palms higher than the III. I have the IIIC. It does work, however the 4 X zoom feature does not work, and when you enable it, it says ""go to our website to see if there is updated software, the 4X zoom does not work with the Palm IIIc"". There is not a patch for the Palm IIIC yet. Also, Seiko's customer support is awful, so if you want no support, this is the place to go!"
4,Monster Truck,"This product worked great and came in a very timely manner, would buy from this place again. Bought for my sons jacked up Ford, and all its gadgets needed for the power boost."
5,Super Cutter,"The quality in construction and ease of cleaning make this a most used item in the kitchen. I use it to cut pizza and various other doughs for baking. After seeing it, everyone in the family wants one."
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"I'm sending mine back...I can't review the video as I can't watch it...you can tell by the ""feel"" of the cassette it is very low budget. I can't get it to track, the sound is off from the video. Not worth the hassle...until they crank out the DVD (amazon.com reflects not available status) then don't waste your money."
2,Crappy remote,"This arrived in a sealed bag, yet the remote was dirty! The top edge also has a green discoloration in the plastic. It is infrared, not radio controlled like the XBox 360 controller. Because of that, you need a good line of site. The range of the remote is short and I cannot use it from everywhere in my modestly sized living room.Also, the directional buttons do not control the XBox menus or inside netflix very well. It can turn the XBox on and off. When playing a netflix or DVD, it is very responsive if you are in range. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,xbox remote,This is not what I thought I was buying.Was so excited for it then when recieved it wouldn't even turn on. There's no instructions with that packaging and was extremely cheap like. the romote completely rattled when moved. Upset with the results.
3,Decent for the price,"This remote is good if you watch a lot of DVDs, Netflix, or Zune on your xbox. Especially if you do not have a kinnect or just get sick of having to turn your wireless controller back on. The only thing I disliked was that you have to make sure you are aiming it directly at your xbox. I actually upgraded to a nicer xbox remote that syncs up with the TV and cable box as well...so it replaced all of our controllers. This one wasn't bad though, especially for the price. I still have it just incase anything goes wrong with the new one."
3,Should have paid more attention to reviews,"I love Bocelli, and have his live concert DVD, ""A Night in Tuscany"". (Loved that one, by the way) I thought ""Tuscan Skies"" would be a live concert also.When I watched the DVD, it was just a bunch of still photos, one after another. Yes they were nice photos, but I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it, hoping to find at least one live performance. I don't have the interest or patience to sit and look at a slide show! No offense to those folks who loved this DVD, I understand everyone has different tastes. If I had it to do over again, I'd just stick to listening to my CD of this one."
1,They wear out fast,I had to take the sheets back to the store because after I washed them 3 times they began to get holes in the fabric - I have also noticed the stitching it becoming ripped from the seams.
5,Happy so far!,"Not sure how well they will wear as the baby has not arrived yet, but they look teriffic with the starlight collection! The entire set is beautiful!"
1,BEWARE!,I have this microwave which came with my new home that I purchased 3 years ago. I live by myself and therefore this microwave just gets minimal use. I am on this website to look for a NEW microwave because this one has already stopped working. I can't believe that a microwave would only last 3 years. All of a sudden it just stopped cooking. Everything else still works but it will not get hot. I have read on other sites where other people have had the same problem with this model. I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this microwave.
4,Fresh and funny,"Great movie. Written in a mockumentary style, it draws from every facet of pop culture with a slew of guest stars. It pokes fun of today's 'divas', black exploitation, and celebrities to boot. A fresh and funny movie full of dry comedy. Definite reccomendation."
5,If it's perfection you must see...LOOK AT ME!!!!,"This movie is hilarious. Nonstop laughter. I taped it off lifetime when it first aired and lost it. I recently moved and lo and behold I found it. I am shocked it didn't come out on the big screen. It's so much better than most of this slop they put out now. My favorite parts are when Jackie has the woman on the infomercial to eat the relaxer, when Jackie and Kim fight over the dresses, and when Jackie is trying to convince everyone to calm down about getting paid. ""Leave Jackie to worry about the money"" ""You want to get paid? Honey, I don't carry cash, my daughter Antandra will take care of everything"" ""My good friend liza gave me that oscar, she wasn't using it"" "" I can't add or subtract but I learned alot about life and that's what matters."" I could go on and on. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!"
5,Black and White Knitting Machine Manual,"Lots of pictures, which are all in black and white.Close to 90 percent of this book is identical to the manuals that come with the machines - very basic. The DVD does show the casting on, knitting, intarsia, transfering stitches and binding off taking place, but no sound.? I finally got to see a linker in action. There is a chapter on blocking and assembling a sweater. The final chapter has a couple projects . . . a scarf, hat, sweater and slippers. I actually made 2 sets of slippers - which uses the 'short-rowing' technique.Not a very creative book, I was expecting to learn to do some fancy stitches on my machine. But, if you've lost your manual(s), this is your book."
3,fast shipping,product is great was covered in some sort of food so product did not appear to be of quality it was listed at. Great book!
2,lookin' for enjoyment,"One of the ""DVD's worked fine.Three of the ""DVD's did not work (would not start & would not eject).Three of the ""DVD's were unopened."
2,Ughhh...,"I have heard good things about this, can't say I enjoyed it... A bit too sticky, as I find with alot of others."
5,Excellent!!! Support this rising star!!,"I have to admit that I am a friend of the author, but being as objective as possible this book was a page-turner!! I lost a lot of sleep for about 4 nights enjoying this book. This is Louis Kelley's freshman novel and is a fantastic foundation for many more to come. Try it and you won't regret it!"
5,Likely to Become Bach Favorite for Guitar,"I've always enjoyed Parkening and others who do Bach on the guitar. Here, noted classic guitarist Isbin provides a beautifully crafted and performed set of baroque favs on guitar.She plays with controlled passion and clarity, and to my ear her Bach is even more clean and phrased superior to Parkening's.The selection is well chosen, with great addition to instrument's reportoire of Vivaldi's Concerto in A major.I find her Albioni's Adagio very well done! The dynamics are well done as well as tempo in this spirited rendiiton.Ms. Isbin certainly is one of the premiere performers of this instrument, and here is a well done collection from the baroque era, which many of us consider to be one of the best."
3,STUDENTS: READ FOR REPORTS!,"Im very bored and decided since practically no one has cared to write a review for this wonderful book, I would put my two cents worth in and hopefully help other students out like myself. ""An Enemy of the People"" is one of Ibsen's greatest 5 act plays. After being assigned ""A Doll's House""~ (BEWARE BORING! ) and ""Hedda Gabler""~ (Um, WEIRD!) I decided to try to find a play by Ibsen that didn't deal with a woman against society and authority. I came up with the play ""An Enemy of the People"" which proved to be a lot more interesting and entralling than some of Ibsen's other dramas. If your looking for a report with literary elements that are very easy to identify and that actually has a fairly interesting storyline you should definetely give this play a try! Hope this helps!"
5,"A really, truely, absolutly, great book!","This is the best series I have ever read. After reading the first one I had to go on. Though the ending was sad, the adventures were incredible. In fact I'm suprised they haven't made a movie of it."
1,Disappointed,"Ok, really? This exact version was terrible. I can't believe I paid for this. It looks likes one of those bootleg movies recorded with a video camera off of a movie screen. Guess I didn't think Amazon sold crap like that."
5,Solved my problem,Had the need in my garden for three hoses. Could only find options for 2 or 4 way manifolds in the local stores. Has worked great so far.
3,Sound Clarification,"I have bought the CD set myself and while I'm not crazy about the third CD in the set, overall, the I think this compilation of songs is pretty terrific.However, ""BigBoyBen"" mentioned that he/she didn't approve of the sound quality of the many of the songs. It should be pointed out that many of the broadcast recordings, particulary on the 1st and 2nd discs were probably taken directly from the performance recorded on the set...to teletape or videotape and not recorded in a proper recording studio. So, keeping that in mind, I think the tracks sound pretty good.The fact that we have these recordings; documents of our youths that have been long entrenched in our memories is a pretty significant thing...regardless of how they were recorded."
1,save your money,"I think the unit has been discontinued, that is about the best you can say about it. I ordered one from grizzly, when received the three main plastic pieces were broke out of the box. called customer service and they are sending replacements but it will be after a lengthy backorder wait of almost 2 months. I've got other grizzly products and it seems that they must get there plastic parts from some third world country that has no quality assurance."
5,Flavor Savers are the Best!,"Strawberry Flavor Savers by Avon are the absolute best lip gloss! Sunscreen included in formula, too!"
1,Horrible Experience,"This company is horrible. Never recieved the product that I ordered. And they never responded to the 2 emails that I sent them, had to file a complaint thru amazon to get anything done. Do not purchase from this company."
5,Awesome Show,What was Gemma think. Why would she sit on the coach after shooting that girl. I hate Agent June Stahl. She needs to die already!!!! I think it is crazy that so many people who were there since the beginning are dead already. I thought they would be in the movie for a long time. This is a great movie. Husband and I can't wait to start season three.
5,Sons of Anarchy Season Two (Blu-ray),This was a Christmas gift and of course they loved it. I'll be buying Season three and four soon too.
4,great show,my husband got me watching this show and it is addictive i have bought him every season and he watches the current one on the live video option from amazon it is a great show
5,the best show ever,i am a big fans of sons of anarchy. the story lines just keep getting better and better and i am glued to my seat. love all the characters and the parts they play. sons of anarchy rule!!
5,Awesome,"I loved the Sopranos and I love Game of Thrones. Sons of Anarchy rounds out my top 3. The characters are complex as are the story lines. Complex but not confusing. The show not only gets you to invest your interest in the main characters but also the supporting cast. There are so many connections to what happened in a previous episode or season that nothing in the show seems trivial. I have watched all the first four seasons on amazon streaming ( somehow I missed this series and just heard about it about 6 weeks ago), and can't get enough!"
5,Awesome TV Show,"Picking up where the first season left off, The Sons of Anarchy are in turmoil. The ATF is still on their backs. The gun business has dried up. The gang is divided. Jax Teller remains at the center of this division. He knows his stepfather and President,Clay is responsible for the death of a SAMCRO member's wife, but Jax must decide whether to put his club's, his family's or his friend's interests first. The conflict doesn't stop with Jax. Division is a central theme of Season Two. Each character struggles with his/her own internal issues. Clay must decide how to best handle a son he loves but who has begun to question his authority, at every turn."
2,Bad disc,"Hard to watch, very frustrating with the skipping and digital image distortion. Was wondering if this was a pirated DVD since it was supposedly new. Product arrived promptly after purchasing."
3,Too much female,"When I watch a series about biker gangs, I don't expect 60% of the show to be about the women and degenerate into 'Days of our lives'. I really enjoyed season 1, but season 2 has become basically a show for the women."
3,Sons of Anarchy,I purchased seasons 1 and 2 for my husbands birthday and one of the discs from season 2 isn't working properly. It played one episode fine then kept freezing on the other episodes and now tut DVD player cannot play it at all. It's very frustrating.
4,Not Bad,"A little pricey but these are useful. Like their big brothers, these take a little time to break in and get used to using. If you work alone like me, you are always looking for tools/ways to make the job a little easier. These jacks work fine to support cabinets, apply pressure to countertops and a variety of other tasks that require a ""3rd"" hand. Like most Fast Cap products, the idea is great but the quality control has a little to be desired. All in all a decent product."
5,GREAT,"I own a firebird 1, 2, and freedom. I have not flown the freedom, but it has very simple controls, and it is better than the 1 & 2, which were AWESOME!"
5,Just what we needed,This book was just what we needed to help us understand and control our son's asthma. Dr. Farber explains things in a clear and easy to understand manner. I keep this book accessible at all times. I definitely recommend it to anyone who has a child suffering from asthma. It's great for first time parents of asthmatic children and for those who have had years of experience as well.
4,Daughter loves this scooter!,My 5 year old daughter loves this scooter. My husband put it together in a flash and it seems to be very durable. She loves the colors and the bag on the front.We would highly recommend this!
2,"Be careful- fragile, poor quality tool","These things might be okay for homeowner repair, IF you are lucky enough to get one that is functioning, but they will not withstand the rigors of daily use by a builder/ contractor/ remodeler. After one ride in the back of the truck, one of my four poles ended up with a cracked tightening knob. After use on two jobs, one of the 4 poles will no longer extend when the lever handle is pumped. And, be certain you don't use these things to hold up anything that can do serious injury or damage if it falls, because the pump lever mechanism is prone to sudden failure, even when it seems to be working. This tool is a really good idea, but poorly designed and manufactured with bad quality control."
1,Repack - missing parts and accessories,"Product was used; box was a repack. Unit extending 3"" beyound end of box; packing tape used to seal over unit to end of box. Parts and instruction manual missing. Product returned to Amazon for full refund including shipping (Amazon RA).How did such a visually obvious used product pass Amazon Quality Control Inspection prior to shippment? Leads one to wonder if Amazon quality control processes include approval sign off by an inspector; and if the process is being followed and monitored?"
5,3rd Arm is Great,"This is a great tool to have on hand for when you need that other person to help hold something, but nobody is available. You Gotta get this tool!"
4,Handy item to have in one's equipment arsenal,"Worked well as support for a temporary dust barrier wall while installing and finishing drywall. I intend to use these frequently as well, as load locks in my truck bed."
4,the cats meow,I am a finish carpenter who does not work well with others. Before I ordered the 3rd hand product I always had to pay someone to help me hang crown mold.The 3rd hand set of 4 cost about the same as I would have to pay someone to help me 1 day.The product actually holds crown mold right where you want it to. It is excellent for making splices on long walls and with special order millwork where you often get short lengths.I ordered this this spring after looking at it at amazon for years. You combine this with a walkboard or 2 and the results are amazing. It takes a little practice but the end results are worth it. I always thought that it probably would not work as well as it says but I was wrong. I should have ordered it the first time I saw it.
3,Directions weren't that great,"The directions were ok, but not great. Luckily my spouse knows a quite a bit about stringed instruments and was able to make it playable. But for the price it was fun to put together and plays like I expected it to."
5,Read This Book,"Nabhan has written a beautifully eloquent book about the Papago people of Arizona. The book focuses on the importance of rainfall to these desert dwellers and the way that it has become a key part of their culture and their celebrations. But this book is more than a simple study of desert climate and agriculture. It is an exploration of the beauty of the desert and of an ancient culture that is stuggling to live on their traditional lands in spite of the seperation from their families across the border in Mexico, and despite the lessened rainfall. In the desert the rain is a magical thing, and Nabhan has captured the feeling of the first raindrops after a long dry-spell. A beautiful work."
5,What a Writer!,"Once I found one of Robert Whitlow's book, I purchase one and then another of his! He can weave a story and it' all clean and godly. Being a lowcountry gal, I identify with many of the places his characters live and visit which to me is extra special.If you've pondered about purchasing one of his books, do yourself a favor and get one. He usually writes several in a series so please read them all.ChristyCharleston, SC"
4,Good Job,"The wifes life takes on new twist and becomes more and more unnerving. While her husband lay alive, she has to contend with the death of a police officer, criminal charges, and other emotional situations trying to drive her insane.The lawyer continues to struggle with what to believe as the clients mind goes deeper and deeper into insanity. Evan as she herself is brought up on charges, she continues to struggle with the divorve case before her and the criminal case she is now assisting on.The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way it ended. the wedding proposal between the lawyer and the church pastor, I felt, opened another door for another book that was never written. And yes, I stated that opinion to Robert Whitlow. From the understanding I received from him, he has another idea for continuing the series but is not allowed to write it per the publisher's instructions."
2,Disappointed and Confused,"I was really impressed with the first book I read from Robert Whitlow, Water's Edge, but Life Everlasting was not up-to-par. To be honest, I'm still not sure what actually happened.Throughout the story, one of the characters, Rena, is caught in lie after lie. Her story keeps changing, bringing with it twists to the overall plot. I was actually enjoying the story and the character (for the most part - I did have a few issues with a few of the characters), but when the book ended, I was left confused and unsure of what the resolution of the plot was.I'm going to have to give this book 2 out of 5 stars. Two weeks after finishing it, I'm still confused."
1,Six-Dinner Sid,"The book, Six-Dinner Sid (Aladdin Paperbacks, purchased in 2008) included an advertisement for Cheerios printed on the inside back cover of the book. So every time you read the last page of the book, your child will see an advertisement from a cereal company. No, thank you. We prefer not to have advertisements in our children's literature."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"When i first got this game back in the Summer of 2004 I was amazed at the gameplay. But not only the gameplay was cool, the music got the battles going and kept it alive. I thought that the character were cool and being an amateur artist I drew some pictures. When I found this book I immediately ordered it hoping for some cool drawings. Sadly this did not happen. Not one picture of the Summon Spirits were to be found. Only the playable characters and Mithos were in it. Kinda short and was a waste of money. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!"
4,Satisfied,The package of cards was in very good shape and worked extremely well for what I wanted to use them for.
5,Best recording of these pieces,I bought these recordings at the same time I bought another by a popular recording artist form Europe advertised on Amazon. These are the recordings you want; the others sound too commercial. Beautiful music that put you in a dream state....wonderful sound as well. Very clear recordings that soothe.
4,These pieces are very colourful with a bright instrumentatio,I've heard these pieces several times. I like Eclat very much. It is a bright piece. Rituel is also very good for its rithmic continuity with a sparkling instrumentation in wich I heard some remembrance of the use of orchestral colouration of Maderna. The performances are as you can expect from Boulez: Very clear and exact.
1,low quality,"Low quality gasket stick to factory stainless gaskets, I reused factory gaskets these look like a leak ready to happen."
3,"Informative, but over priced","Recieved this video off of Netflix, after wanting to purchase it for many years to use in my classroom when teaching about Elizabethan theatre. The video was informative, but at only 30 minutes long, it is WAY over priced, even for the amazon instant download. It would be a more interesting video if it showed more of the construction phase of the new Globe Theatre in London, and details about theatres various areas."
2,This book is not for beginners,"Don't let the title fool you: The issues discussed are abstract, complex, and with NO SIMPLICITY at all. Wrong title on book: It does not simplify the theory of training of dressage horses and riders. The content is scattered, and not practical for ordinary riders to understand. If you use dressage terms to describe this book: It is ""above the bit"", ""Not collected"", ""Rear end sticks out"", ""Downhill"", ""Hasty little steps"", ""Rough transitions"" ...."
2,Nice meter - did not work for us,"We prefinish siding in a factory and have used several different types of meters. Our most consistent model was a pinless Wagner L606 analog, which looks similar to this Accuscan model. We had hoped that the wider range and dual scale on the Delmhorst Accuscan would work well for both wood and cement siding materials, so we ordered one to try.The needle danced irratically and was generally too lively to get a good reading. I saw inconsistent readings on the materials I sampled. I believe that the unit I purchased may have been damaged or otherwise out of calibration. Due to immediate need for true readings in our factory, I decided to forego a replacement and went back to the Wagner L606 analog which has worked extremely well for us for a long time. We decided if it's not broken, don't fix it."
4,Accuscan has great features,I really like the Accuscan moisture meter. The wide scale range is great. I absoulutely recommend using this product!
1,Just a little politically incorrect.......,"After a smash hit with Curious George goes to the Hospital, we decided to get this for my 3.5 year old. We were shocked! George is abducted by the man with the yellow hat (is actually shown shackled in a bag), nearly drowns while falling off the ship catching seaguls (is shown gasping for air underwater), then is confronted by very angry firefighters after experimentally making a phone call that results in a false alarm. The final shocker is George being thrown in jail and desparately trying to get out which finally results in his crying. This was little too much for our 3.5 year old.Buyer beware!!!!!"
2,Pretty low quality,"I made the mistake of going cheap on rear shock mounts and bought these. RSM's on e36's are prone to fail and absolutely wreck shock towers causing thousands of dollars in damage; the simple maintenance of replacing the RSM's prevent this. These shock mounts are cheap, light, and the little rubber balls break off easy. Buy some Ground Controls and don't be disappointed."
3,A difficult task completed,"Medieval Hebrew is difficult to translate, and when the topic is mysticism, it is even more so. The translator has done a good job, though the manuscript(s) he used must have been slightly incomplete (for instance, in the attributions of planets to signs of the zodiac.)The Sepher Rezial (or Raziel) is a good complement to the Sepher Yetsirah, but it cannot replace the Sepher ha-Zohar. It will mostly be useful to advanced Kabbalists, for whom it provides invaluable information as to the 72 Names (vehu, Yeli, Sita, etc). It also demonstrates that Kabbalists used Astrology extensively.It is a book that deserves an attentive study by experienced Kabbalists."

2,MirroMatic Pressure Cooker Rubber Gasket,I was very disappointed because this was the second one I had bought and just knew it would be THICK ENOUGH and it is about half as thick as the old one was - so consequently does not work at all.
4,"Good novel, better twist","This is not one of Matheson's best efforts, but it is definitely better than most novels out there and has a really good twist that sucker punches you when you least expect it. Overall a well written effort and a great imagination which characterizes most of his works."
5,A deftly written and composed memoir,"They say one of the greatest tragedies of the world is when a father outlives his son. ""Chris: A Memoir"" is how Joe Marziotti copes with this tragedy as his son spent the last three years of his life battling the horrible disease leukemia. Reflecting on his son's life but remembering to keep his spirit alive by not being strictly morbid and remembering the good times, ""Chris: A Memoir"" is a deftly written and composed memoir, and a must for any parent in a sadly similar situation and seeking a proverbial shoulder to cry on."
5,Amazing Cello,"This cello is amazing! Beautiful sound, looks beautiful, and its great for a beginner like me! It came with extra strings and rosin, which was EXCELLENT to add! It also came with everything in the description! The most important thing, it got to my home not even 24 hours after I bought my cello! It came about 14-16 hours after I bought it! Absolutely would recommend! (:"
5,Season 3,The Sopranos is a series that gets better and better! Its the soap opera series for gangster movie officianados! Simply SUPERB! Realistic and official!
4,The Sopranos As Greek Tragedy,"The role of the therapist in the third season of The Sopranos is one of moral observer without the power to intervene effectively.Similar to the role of the Greek Chorus in ancient tragedies, theposition of the psychiatrist is one of an observer who knows more than the individual characters. In one example, an elderlypsychotherapist refuses to take ""blood money"" from Carmela, who continues on with her life unaffected by his admonition. Tony refuses to listen when his therapist wants to explain the real reasons for his actions. Much like Oedipus, Tony is doomed to compulsively act out his unconscious destiny. Not simply a cultural icon, the therapist reflects on the entire process and explains it on a deeper level to the audience."
2,went down compared to the first two seasons,the third Season had alot of Promise but it was more overall Hype than actual Substance.I think they wacked the wrong people.the show kinda limped a bit minus His Presence last year to me overall.it just seemed a step or two off the past year.the first Season to me was a Solid A.the 2nd Season A- but last Year to Me was very Average in alot of Spots.so when the 15nth comes around it will be interesting to see how it bounces back.the show is well written&Developed but it was missing some fire&passion overall to me.
2,Season 3 = beginning of the end,"Season 3 of the Sopranos is where the show slipped into soap-opera mode and became dull. If you enjoy the tension between Tony and his wife, you'll love this DVD set. I find myself wishing they'd just stopped after the second season and went out on a high."
4,what can you say?? Its the Sopranos!,"If you've seen it and you love it, you know you have to own it! You know all about it, its hyped up and tops, HBOs best yet. This mob family is a huge hit and who couldnt love Tony, Carm, Meadow and the rest? I dont even think it needs a review, I believe majority of people have seen it and loved it. Now all you gotta do is own it!"
3,Good Season. . .,". . .but not quite as good as the previous two. This season definately had it's uneven moments. They ranged from poor (lackluster season finale) to incredible (""Pine Barrens""--was THE BEST hour of television that year). There are many unanswered questions from this season: What will happen to Dr. Melfi?, What's up with Paulie?, Where did the Russian go?, Will Janice ever get what's coming to her?, What will happen with Ralphie, Meadow, Anthony Jr.?, and How do the New York families play into the unfolding drama? So while the Sopranos is still the best show on television, Season 3 does not quite live up to Seasons 1 & 2. Also there were way to many unanswered questions that we had to wait well over a year to get answered."
4,Kids will love this book!,"P. Bear is having a New Year's Party and all his best-dressed friends are invited. Each time the clock strikes the hour, a corresponding group number of exotic animals shows up. By midnight, P. Bear has a full house and your child will have a grasp of the clock face.This sturdy board book is attractively illustrated and is great for years of childhood. The simple black, white and red illustrations are perfect for newborn eyes as parents first read aloud to their babies. The board book is handy for toddlers who love to be rough with their beloved stories. The sequential numbers teach counting to preschoolers and the reference to time with the appropriate clock-face on each page sets a great foundation for learning to tell time. Besides, the book is full of exotic animals. What child doesn't enjoy that?Armchair Interviews says: P. Bear's New Year's Party is an overall great book from birth to six and beyond."
5,THE BEST BUY FOR YOUR BUCK!,"This book was a tremendous help. I bought it only a week-and-a-half before my FE Exam, and it helped wonders. I even passed the FE on my first try! I am definitely recommending this book. It is a huge time-saver. If you can have all the equations ready to go in your calc, then all you have to do is plug in the variable's values, and it's a lot quicker than writing all of that down to solve it! LOVE THIS BOOK! Excellent buy!"
1,Not really worth it,"The book is direct, to the point, and does indeed help you set up your HP 33s with engineering equations.But that's about it. The HP33s isn't really that user friendly a calculator to input a lot of formulas into, and on the FE exam the formulas are actually in the reference manual. Having to look up which formula I entered into the calculator while doing a practice test took longer than looking it up in the manual and writing the formula in the margins.Good book...just not very useful."
3,Equation book for HP 33s,"All of the equations in this book, plus many more equations and theory can be downloaded for free on the FE website. The HP 33s calculator is really not necessary for the exam."
4,To the Golden Shore,"A very thorough and well written book on the life of Adoniram Judson and those that travelled with him, to what used to be called Burma, in order share the love of God and the hope of Christ, in the face of much hardship. Inspirational reading"
4,worth the wait,"I had been searching for this book for years! All i can say is that is worth the wait. Anyone who loves to read about the struggles of missionaries will really be challenged by this biography. Even those unsympathetic to evangelism will be inspired by the courage of one, who was willing to risk torture, life and limb, to bring the gospel into Burma. Adoniram Judson was the first American foreign missionary to Burma. From start to finish, there is tension and adventure, all meticulously orchestrated by the providence of God. A great read!Willy"
4,NORTH CAROLINA AND HURRICANES,"Anyone interested in the history of hurricanes anywhere in this hemisphere will enjoy this book. North Carolina is the focus and subject, of course, but Barnes includes some information on other areas and storm lore in general. Animal lovers will enjoy one of the last chapters, where we hear how the state's dogs and horses make out when the storms come.Mostly this is, as advertised, a history of North Carolina's hurricanes. Particular attention is given to storms like Hazel and Fran, in 1954 and 1996, respectively, that did extensive damage. Readers may notice the long breaks in time between storm activity. Time that allows overconfidence, overbuilding and disaster memory to fade."
2,Terrible to put together,"Mine also had scratches upon delivery. But putting it together was a nightmare. I should say IS, because I am still trying to put it together! The slots do not line up well with each other, causing you to try numerous times to get the pieces to fit together. Also the decorative pieces that go on the upper sides do not slide completely in, so I was forced to (with great difficulty) get them out again and leave it with these empty slots on the side looking rather bad. The idea of this item would have been great and very convenient if it had not come with scratches and was much easier to put together."
4,Serbo-American Heinz 57,"I first heard this band on public radio and they immediatly interested me. Kultur Shock is a blend of American popular music crossbred with Serbian (folk) music in it's traditional style. Most songs sound Serb with added electric guitar, but some are more uniqely American influenced. If your in to musical oddity period or the Traditional sounds of Western Europe, I think you will enjoy Kultur Shock. And Unless you live in Seattle or Serbia, this is the only web-site where your going to find this band, so go ahead and buy it now."
5,Have you heard these words????,"If you have, then this book is for you! If your child is in the terrible twos-or threes, then you will both like this book! It is amusing for the toddler to be in the grown-up role. There is a message for parent and child alike."
2,Stabila Plate Level Case,"I do not know how to rate this product. When it was delivered Fed Ex thru it over the fence and my dog chewed it. Since then, i have been trying to replace it thru Amazon to no satisfaction. Amazon has no phone number to talk to a real person, just a very complicated website with no contact for this type of problem. The vendor who sent this item has not responded to numerous E-mails. However Amazon. com has acknowledged they were sent. Since then I have re-ordered the product direct and hope Amazon reimburses me"
4,It's A Dream,"I understand that the machine isn't perfect but it's a must have. I admit that it is pricey but it's worth it. I've had the machine for four months now and my wife and I can't see how we could live without it. It simplifies the process of mopping. No more buckets, no more wringing out the mop, or redistributing dirty water. I have to admit, the brushes aren't very powerful, so sometimes you do have to get down and scrub some areas, but with the convienince this provides it's a small set back. A few problems it has are, if you clean a small area and forget to empty out the dirty water tank, it can get pretty rank, the vacuum is decent but not powerful enough to pick up all things that hit the floor, also the cleaning solution can get pricey, hopefully generics start hitting shelves soon. I mainly use this on tile and linoleum and it's done great so far. All in all this is a great product and I strongly recommend it's purchase."
2,Not so happy,"Our new house has tile bathrooms, entryways and a large tile floor in the kitchen. I had been using a Swifter and bought the FloorMate hoping to make scrubbing the floor easier. It does not pick up debris nor clean the tiles effectively. I still use my regular vacuum to ""sweep"" the floors prior to using the FloorMate.It cannot reach into the recessed grout lines. The tile downstairs, which has an uneven surface, gets cleaned unevenly. The upperstairs tile, which is flush, gets much cleaner. My biggest complaint is that the suction feature doesn't work well. In the middle of cleaning, it stops drawing up the water. The instructions say to check the automatic shut off, but I've found that it is tempermental. The clean and dirty water tanks don't always snap into position tightly and it doesn't clean corners and at the baseboard intersection well.Its ok, but I've found that I will still need to go behind the FloorMate with the Swifter as it does a better job and will fit around the toilet."
1,High build quality..no performance,"The product overall is very high in fit and workmanship, it just doesn't clean floors. It suctions water perfectly, but the rotating brushes are made for the very lightest of dust or fresh spills. It will not clean a floor like a mop and scrub brush. And it could..but the brushes are flat and not designed for real cleaning. It just scoots over set in dirt. The brushes are more appropriate for polishing, not scrubbing. I guess that's why on the commercial they show wet, fresh mud tracks. It reminds me of a kids toy, not a utility machine. A little more weight on the brushes would help too. I returned mine. It's a very good concept. But in practice, it does not work."
1,Horrible at sensing humidity,"I've had it a week, but it's going back. As the other reviews say, it measures the humidity level at either 30% or 33%, no matter how small the room or how long it's been running. The humidity sensor is useless.The lights are far too bright. My bedroom looks like a disco with the thing on and the night light is almost as bright as my lamp.Others didn't seem to have much of a problem with this, but ours is far from silent, especially when you first turn it on. It seems to quiet down some after it runs for awhile, but it is far from silent.Look elsewhere folks. You can do a lot better for a lot less money."
2,Makes more work out of Housework!,"The machine is lightweight but I found that when dry vacuuming it did not glide easily.I had to stop now and empty the recovery tank with the dirt. I then set the machine to wet and found that the brushes did not remove anything that was stuck on the floor( I have two small children who tend to spill). I also had to stop in the middle of the floor to add more solution and water. I did like how it picked up the water, my floors which are ceramic did dry quickly(but they don't do too badly when I flip on the ceiling fan either!)Then comes emptying the dirty water. I found it a bit messy and then I had to clean the recovery tank and the nozzle. I found it took me twice the amount of time to clean the floors with double the work. For the money it is not worth it!I wonder if the people who rated this machine with five stars are employees of Hoover."
1,Poor quality.,What a lousy design. All plastic and contstantly breaks. Ours quit dispensing water after 30 days and you cannot even make adjustments on it because of the cheap plastic parts. Not their best product!
5,Love it!,It works GREAT for me. The brushes do touch the floor. It leaves my floor very nicely clean.
1,horrible machine i cant believe it has good reviews!,I bought this hunk of junk this morning. I read the directions and tried using it. First the upper resevoir leaked so i emptied it out to just a quarter full... still leaked. I kept trying and then the bottom reservoir leaked dirty water all over too. I'm taking this hunk back to the store for my money back and buying a swiffer!
3,clogged detergent dispenser,"please help, my detergent dispenser seems to be clogged. it worked well for weeks and just seemed to stop. i turned the machine over but could not see where the detergent came out.anyone with a similar problem please help. bill"
1,Don't toss your mop and bucket,"I really, really wanted to love my FloorMate, but it simply does not do the good job it promises. It works ok as a vacuum, but it is very big, heavy, and EXTREMELY loud.I wanted to use it to clean my kitchen floor, but it takes forever to try to get it to ""scrub"" any dirt or food off of the floor, and it often just can't do it. It takes far less time to use a mop and bucket, and the floor will look much nicer in the end if you do.Overall, it is an extremely disappointing purchase."
3,Does a pretty good job,"I'm a mom with two kids and I also do day care so I thought this would be the answer to the constant spills. I've read the other reviews on this site and although I do like this product it doesn't clean as well as they say. It does an o.k. job. I love the concept, however it doesn't pick up a lot of things with the dry pickup so I usually still have to sweep and the scrubbing doesn't really clean anything stuck to the floor, I still have to pre-treat or scrub as I go. I do want to say though that for the everyday clean up it does a good job. It is great for a quick clean up and I love that it dries the floor, no more falls!!"
4,A little noisy but my floors are really clean.,I have 2 dogs and 2 kids and they make a real mess on my kitchen floor. This machine is god sent in many ways. My only complain is that it's a little noisy and pricey.
4,Other Uses for Floor Mate,"In addition to cleaning floors so well, I can also use it on Corian counter topswith the cleaning solution. The Old English cleaner works well onshining wood floors. With Old English I also run the Floor Mate on the topof our long oak kitchen table to deep clean it.I think the design of the bigger tank (dirty water recovery) is a poor fit and have had troublewith the suction/drying function of the Floor Mate when the biggertank is not aligned perfectly."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought a Hoover Floormate because I hate mopping floors and thought this would be great. I got it home and used it twice and it was awesome. By the third use, the machine wouldn't suck up the water. I took it in for repair and the repairman serviced it but couldn't find anything wrong with it. I got it home used it once and it was fine. The next time I used it the floor was sopping wet again, so I just mopped up the mess with my mop. The next time I turned it on, smoke started pouring out. This machine had only been used 6 times. It is a piece of junk. I hate it."
4,Not a bad vacuum,"I just bought the Hoover Floor Mate and try itout for 1 day. Overall the Hoover Floor Mateis a pretty nice Cleaner. It will vacuum wetor dry without any problem, but I wish thescrubing will be a little better. If Hooverimprove on the scrubing action then I would givethis 5 stars."
5,I love it!,"I bought this last night and immediately tried it when I got home on my filthy kitchen floor. I am so pleased, I can't wait to use it again. It was quick, easy, a back saver and the floor dried almost instantly. The best thing is that you're not pushing dirty water around on the floor. I would highly recommend this product."
2,"Pain in the, um, neck","First you fill the machine up with water and soap, then you dry vacuum the area to be cleaned, then you wash the area to be cleaned, then you wet vacuum the entire to area to soak up the extra water, then the real fun begins. You empty the dirt bucket and wash it out, was out the soap bucket and then take apart the entire bottom part with the brush because it's filthy and clean that part and then put it back on. Then you get to lug this very heavy machine back to where ever you keep it. Mine is more often used as a coat rack, it's not that it doesn't work, it's just more trouble then it's worth."
1,Not worth the hassle,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. Does not vacuum the floor very well. Like the other reviews, its best feature is that it Squeegees up the water and leaves your floor dry. That one feature does not make this product worth it. I found it to be a big pain to clean the unit after using it. It took me on average 10 minutes to thoroughly clean all the components. The best decision I made was taking it back to the store."
2,Disappointing,This machine does not come close to its billing. At best its Dry feature moves the dirt around. You need to sweep prior to use. The wet function only works well if done very slowly and at least two times over each area. Frequently it leaves streaks and at times merely moves the dirt around. The streaking is quite noticable.Probably works better on smoother surfaces as our vinyl has some indentations which present cleaning problems for this product.I would wait for the second generation of these cleaners. This one will be regulated to the basement.
4,Good wet cleaning ability.,"Very good at wet cleaning and drying floor. The vacuum cleaner feature is not great, and the capacity of the canister is small, so that you need to put in fresh cleaning solution / dump out dirty water every 5 minutes or so."
1,Doesn't work on textured surfaces,Let me say that this thing does suck up water and leave the floor almost dry. The problem I had was that the brushes don't make very good contact with my tile floor... We took it back after 2 days.
4,Great on smooth but not textured floors,This machine is easy to use and has a larger dirty water pick up tank than the Dirt Devil model that is similar. It cleans well on smooth vinyl floors. BUT IT DOES NOT GET DIRT OUT of the little indentations in textured vinyl floors. I still have to get down on my hands and knees and use a scrub brush to get the dirt out of the textured floor. It is great for picking up this loosened dirt after scrubbing by hand! Perhaps a brush attachment that has multi-leveled bristles would reach into the texture indentations and clean better?
4,Four and a half stars really...,"I use my floor mate on vinyl kitchen flooring and I have to agree with the positive comments already given by the other reviewers. I won't bore you all to tears by saying the same thing in some new way. What I do want to mention is that I only give this thing 4.5 stars because the dry vacuum mode is not all that great. If you have a few crumbs in the middle of your floor this will pick them up no problem. If you have a few crumbs around your baseboard or in the corners (as many of us do), this thing will drive you mad as you try unsuccessfully to pull those crumbs. Eventually I give up and sweep with a broom first and then use the scrub/wet vac settings to produce a very clean floor. Its a small complaint but one I though worth mentioning. If the vacuum power on this thing were a bit stronger, it would easily be 5+ stars!"
2,Herb's experience with the H3000,"I found the H3000 to be complicated, too heavy and difficult to operate. Too many parts, not enough results. Did not get close to edges and corners. Brushes hardly touched the surface. It did get up a lot of dirt from ceramic tile, but preparation and cleanup of equipment is excessive. I packed it carefully with large instruction book and spare detergent and gave it to charity."
3,lacks power,"actually I haven't used it on a wooden floor, I used it on 12x12 terracota tile and it doesn't do a very good job."
1,"Lucy Ricardo ""Handy Dandy Vacuum""","I read all the reviews and ordered one, I just didn't have the same glowing results. It didn't suck up fluid at all, the vacuum never sucked only blew out air and cleaning solution and I returned it. Not for everyone I guess :)"
5,For people who hate to mop,"I bought this product after spending three weeks scrubbing the dirt from my ceramic tile grout with a grout brush (I wore the bristles down to the handle!) Years of mopping had simply moved the dirt from the tiles into the grout. It was one of the best investments I ever made. Not only does it do the job well but it is fun to use! One of my biggest complaints about mopping (from my daughter) was it took forever to dry. Now I can mop the floor anytime and not have to worry about someone wiping out.It is also great for mopping up those accidental spills (such as a gallon of milk dropping out of the refridgerator, dropped cups of juice, etc) and it doesn't leave the stickiness behind.A worthwhile investment for those of us who hate to mop."
4,Hoover H3000 Floor Mate,"I love the floor mate, works good, extra dirty spot you may have to do by hand, other than that works great."
2,not what i expected,"The floor mate can not cope with dog hair - clogs immediately (we have a collie and a GSD). The wet scrubber/vac does not put out enough cleaning solution and spots (2 day old) on the hardwood floor require some effort to remove - and, of course, you have to be sure all the hair is out prior to wet useThe floor mate does pick up small dirt particles better than anythingLikely works best for those without kids or dogs"
2,Not worth the money,"We moved into a house with wood floors and tile floors, so I was excited to try this product. I must say it doesn't impress me. It doesn't have a lot of power, and fails to lift debris out of the grout. It also doesn't get the edges well, I have to use a regular broom for edges and corners. The wet scrub feature is okay, though it really does not dry the floor as you go."
3,Can't Handle Heavy Loads,"I'm a consultant, so find myself traveling to customer sites quite often. I wanted a bag that would accommodate my laptop, chargers, iPad, cell phone, materials and so forth. The volume, layout and features of this bag are great and the leather looks and feels good enough for a bag.The big selling feature to me was the retractable strap, which broke and refused to retract after just a few trips bearing a heavy load. There really should be a weight limit published.I finally managed to get it to retract but now it won't extend. So I find myself having to carry it by the handles or strap it to a rolling bag. Not the exeperience I was seeking, to be sure."
5,The Name Says it All,"I've never bought anything that is sold on TV, but a friend recommended this to me. I first tried it at his house, and had to buy it. This is a great alternative to going to the gym. It won't replace power-lifting, but if your goal is to get a great upper-body workout, this is a great value and it's fun to use. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!"
2,too hard on the hands,"well made but way too hard on the hands, needs padding and i am not interested in wrapping in towels. i use the iron gym on the floor for pushups."
3,3 Stars is a fair rate.,"This product deserves only 3 stars, because its advertised swiveling feature is useless. in fact it overwhelms you rapidly. for me, it works better in a simpler way of pushups, without swiveling. but you might like it swiveling as it depends upon an individual preference. about the durability of the swiveling mechanism am not sure how long will it last. else, that part does not itch me."
2,Needs help,The product isn't finished. They should have included optional suction cups for the bottom. That way I could use this awesome piece of equipment for something worthy - climbing buildings like spiderman! The name should be changed to spidey-climbers.
3,push ups,The item was delivered in great shape and in good time. I think the item itself is ok. Nothing great but it reminds you to do pushups just with its presense.
4,"Review of ""Perfect Pushup""","I like the product, but I since saw the same item beingsold in Staples for $19.95. I paid $39.95."
4,Does what it claims,"This product simply does what it's supposed to, ease tension on wrists for push-ups. And the ability to change hand position in the middle of a set is nice as well."
4,Bought For My Husband and He Likes It,I bought these for my husband. He likes the way they reduce the impact on his wrists and hands. They have a nice smooth surface that grips the floor without scratching it. They are a tad bulky but not overly so.
4,"great product, slow shipping, one thing missing...","Quality of construction/manufacturing is good. it's what you expect and does what you want. the only thing I wish was different is that it included more than 1 exercise plan/schedule, rather than charging you another $10 for it. aren't the profit margins good enough on these to not nickel and dime you!?!"
2,Less Than Perfect Pushup,"The perfect pushup is not perfect by any means. One thing they forget to mention is that they don't work well on carpeted surfaces. They have to be used on bare floors or they tend not to rotate very well. If the product was modified by making the base taller so the rotating portion doesn't come into contact with the carpet, they would have a winner!"
1,These reviews DO read like ads...,"Read the reviews before buying. It's like they're straight from the commercial. Is the Perfect Pushup so horrible the company finds it necessary to fill this place wiht phony reviews?I was seriously considering buying this product until now. Amazon, please stand up for your customers."
1,it's awful!,Perfect PushupThis is a really stupid deal that I would return for a credit if I could. I used the stupid things a few times and wound up with a rotator cuff tear. Not such a cool idea--
4,So far so good!!,"Ive seen alot of mixed reviews so I decided to try it out. The perfect pushup I purchased came with a workout chart and a instructional dvd. Which I know alot of people complained about.(if your curios Sports Authority $39.95, Chicago, IL)Ive used it for a few days and I definately feel the difference.The included dvd covers the three basic exercises(regular,wide,close pushups)covers the different forms kneeling, regular and on the chair. Definately a big help.There are some knockoffs out there but u pay for what u get. Definately a well designed product. I feel a good workout in my lower and upper chest and arms which normal pushups cant do.(im still pretty sore but im going to start the 4 week program and I will write another review about the results.Overall i would recommend this product to anyone who likes a challenging workout."
5,Perfect Pushup - Original,"I like the fact first that the handles naturally turn while doing pushups.....I am 64 and want to avoid muscle ""pinches"" from improper training...for beginners, you should do pushups from your KNEES until you get the feel for the product and strength for a complete pushup....also like the fact it keeps the body from touching the floor at any time to prevent ""cheating"" on the excercise.......for people with good blood pressure and doctors ""OK"".......a full pushup is ANEROBIC....requiring VERY HEAVY BREATHING which improves greatly lung ability as well as core strength of the body and excercises so much of the body at the same time it is one of the best excercises and can be done anywhere!!!Wish I had thought of this product 30 yrs ago and invented it myself.....the turning rotation is EXTREMELY SMOOTH!!!!!"
4,great product,"i really enjoy this product. it gives you a great upper body workout. the only drawback is that the workout dvd is sold seperately, it should be included in the package."
4,Good solid construction,These things are nice to use and they definitely do add some effort to an ordinary pushup. This is a good tool to use to tone up and keep in shape and the construction is solid. Doesn't feel like you're going to crack these if you drop something on them. I'd buy these again.
4,work well,"I dont usually get a pump from pushup, but with these I can fill it just after a couple of pushups. nice product, just a little bigger than would like."
2,Caused shoulder pain,There's something about the twisting motion during a pushup that did not work for me. The perfect pushup caused me significant shoulder pain after only a few days. It did help with wrist pain you can get by doing conventional pushups though. Free weights are better than doing pushups anyway.
1,Caution: May be hard on shoulder,"Because push-ups with hands flat on the ground bother my elbows, I bought Perfect Pushup. I felt fine while doing the pushups with these things but, after a few weeks, began to develop pain in my right shoulder. After no success with physical therapy and NSAIDS, MRI showed a SLAP tear. I now need surgery to repair my shoulder. While I cannot prove that Perfect Pushup caused the injury to my shoulder, the timing raises the possibility and I thought it was worth sharing and cautioning others."
3,"Pretty average cards. Cheap, and they'll do the job.",These cards are sufficiently stiff when new. They do wear out at about an average rate when compared with other cards. They're definitely better quality than the giveaway swag-type cards you'll find at corporate events.
2,Not Up to My Standards,"When I opened the box, I was disappointed, though it is difficult to describe what disappointed me. It just didn't seem like a quality product. It was most frustrating because I had previously ordered two other over bed trays that were more to my liking but became out of stock and I was never able to receive them. Perhaps it is because this was not on par with the other table/trays I was looking for that it was a disappointment.It doesn't roll very well on my carpet and is a little too high to use on my mother's bed, which is not completely electric, meaning I have to hand crank the bed up to create the ultimate dining experience for her.However, it does serve its purpose and is somewhat attractive."
1,Use these at work,"These gloves have average strength I suppose but I get a severe allergic reaction to them. Even if I only wear them for an hour my hands start itching intensely for like a week and it even spreads to other parts of my body that I touch. There is a weird gel like substance inside these gloves when it mixes with sweat. I'm allergic to nothing and these are the first products that have created skin irritation in my life. My skin even starts cracking if I keep wearing them. It's happened multiple times so I KNOW it's these gloves causing it, every time I try them again. Other people at work experience skin irritation as well. I'd say it affects maybe 5% of the people at work just from asking around.. I don't know what these are made of or what's put inside them but it can't be good. Sorry just my experience. Lose the weird gel like substance inside them and it might be ok."
1,"DON""T BUY","I BOUGHT THIS MICROWAVE IN MARCH 2009! FOR $200.00 I received on 17 th of the month and on the 20th of APRIL IT STOPPED WORKING. I only used it about 10 times to make popcorn. IT MADE A LOUD SCREECHING SOUND AND WOULD NOT GET HOT. SINCE I USED IT< I COULD'NT GET A REFUND FOR MY MONEY AND THE ONLY OPTION WAS TRYING TO TAKE IT THE SERVICE CENTER. TOTAL RIP OFF. NOW IT""S $99.00!!!! HMMM I WONDER WHY? GO WITH EMERSON."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!,"This item arrived from Amazon and worked right out of the box. Two days later, after light normal use, the motor started making a loud noise, the turntable started spinning slowly, nothing was being heated and there was SMOKE coming out of one of the internal vents. I tried plugging it into another outlet and experienced the same issue.Thank goodness for Amazon's generous return policy, but really, save your money and your time, this item is a piece."
2,Dud,"Just shy of eight months we've had our Sharp R305KS microwave. It was performing just fine in that time period. However, I am VERY disappointed to say that, all of a sudden, it stopped working properly. That is, it makes an unusual sound when I turn it on, and there is no heat generated within the microwave. As an example, I tried to defrost a burger patty, and after cooking it for 60 seconds, there was still ice on the patty. I did a lot of research on microwaves prior to our purchase, and was confident in choosing a Sharp. After this experience, I will not buy another Sharp microwave."
5,Best microwave for the price,"I did a lot of looking around before I bought this, and I have not been disappointed. I've only had it for a month, so I don't know how it will hold up, but so far it is everything it claimed to be and was pretty much the best deal I found--the best quality for the price. It doesn't have a stainless steel interior, but it has this cool technology that directs the microwaves in such a way that food doesn't get baked on if you don't wipe it off immediately. Also, the stainless steel front is really low maintenance. Everything in my kitchen is stainless steel and some stuff just won't look clean unless I use a spray polish. Fingerprints on the microwave wipe clean with a damp cloth. However, the front is the only stainless steel part. The rest is that painted silvery-gray. The turntable mechanism is a little cheap, but it doesn't pop up and derail the turntable (not yet, anyway). It comes off to clean it, though."
4,Great for the office,"We ordered this for the office lunch room, and works just as I expected it to. We use it multiple times a day, every day...it is great.We got it at a steal though...$99.99 plus FREE shipping. I saw it at COSTCO the next weekend for the same price, but we didn't have to lug it to the office.Sharp R-305KS 1-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Microwave Oven, Stainless"
1,Worked great - for three weeks,"We have had a couple of Sharp Carousel microwaves in the past and have always been very happy with their performance, so this is the first brand we went looking for when shopping for our son. That, evidently, was the Sharp of years ago. This worked well for our son in his new apartment - for precisely three weeks. He tried to make microwave mac-n-cheese one afternoon, and the microwave started smoking. This was about a 4 minute process, and the product was specifically designed to be cooked in the microwave. Afterwards, it made a horrible noise and would no longer heat. We bought it here online, so of course, no original packaging three weeks after it was delivered and first used. In essence, we paid $100 for three weeks worth of usage. Not worth our time to try and find a Sharp dealer and possibly pay again for a repair. Now we're off to Wal-Mart to find a replacement brand. We will never buy another Sharp again, nor will we be likely to buy appliances online again."
1,Shoddy Product,"Like many other reviewers, the Sharp microwave I used to have lasted 18+ years. Then I got this to replace it and after 18 months, part of the door latch mechanism broke. I heard something snapped and fell within the door. So, it won't close tightly and of course the machine won't start if the door is not closed properly. Naturally, it's out of warranty. The initial estimate is $60 + tax if it's only the door latches that need to be replaced. Who knows what else the repair shop finds. Might as well as a new one."
1,Melt down,"I bought the microwave 5 months ago. Today I discovered that I could not open the door and realized that the front plastic faceplate is distorted, I suspect from the heat created by the magnetron. I thought that this would have been a good microwave but I see that it's not."
4,Great microwave!,This was exactly what I wanted and it fit perfectly in the space I have. It cooks well (& evenly) & is fairly quiet. A great deal for the price!
3,Stoic,"""Stoic"" is entirely set in a prison cell shared by four prisoners. An argument during a card game soon spiral into bullying, violence and death. ""Stoic ""i s quite different from most of Uwe Boll's other movies. The movie is not light entertainment. It's a 90 minute study in human cruelty and violence. It's brutal and disturbing and certainly not for all tastes but it's fascinating in a way and the actors all do a good job."
2,The product did not fit,"The product did not fit. I had to use the old gasket. I tried to make it work, it just didn't."
1,"Bad Software, and getting worse","This was the last year I will use any Quicken products. Turbo Tax consistently gives confusing message boxes (i.e. Did it print? <Cancel> <OK>), refuses to allow the user to change electronic filing status, and overall is designed only for the simplest forms. It would not allow me view the files before sending. Starting and stoping the program is burdensome at best, with the obvious intent that someone sits down and fills in ALL the information in one sitting. I can not recommend avoiding bad interfaces and design enough. This program once had promise, but now is as complicated and cumbersome to use as Windows itself."
1,I'll Try Again,"Gee, my first review seems to have gotten lost!This is not an easy program to download and install. After you download the product and install it your desktop will be full of ""Intuit"" junk - I didn't like that."
1,Did any one get the mail in rebate,"Last year I bought this from Amazon. We tried to mail in the rebate form and there was a requirement to attach the receipt.Just to make sure, we called Intuit and was told the rebate is not for online purchases, but for over the counter purchases only. We never got the rebate. Any one had any luck so far? I like buying it from amazon, but do not want to be cheated again.Still waiting for $5!!!!"
3,Gift,This was a gift. He likes this dictionary. It i esy to use. Deliery was quck. Would recommend top anyone.
3,Not truly College level,"I have a BA in History, but that doesn't mean I don't come across words I don't know. I wanted a handy, AUTHORITATIVE book for the nightstand for those odd words that come up in history texts (and, yes, novels). ""Strake"" is a good example (thank you Bernard Cornwell). That word is not in this book. Neither is the ""F"" word - ironically, the true touchstone of collegiate work. This book is good for the High School level, but would flunk for any college level. Sad, because Webster's hardcover collegiate is one of the best."
3,It's OK,"Kind of an interesting read...one woman's experiences, good and bad, being a redhead. More pro's than con's come with the uniqueness of being a rare, beautiful redhead!"
3,This one is pretty different.,"What bothered me about this book wasn't the eroticism (in truth, I found the sex scenes deliciously different for a romance tale), but the complete departure from what I know a Small novel to be. This book wasn't as descriptive, nor did it explore the characters' personalities as much as previous works. Bertrice Small usually goes on and on and on and ON about locations, character details, even matters as simple as royalty parties and fetes. With this novel she seems to just say, ""Here's Belle. Here's Hugh. They're married. Uhoh, something happened, let's go find her. (Insert bed scene here.) All over. The end."" A little more depth would have been nice. But the erotic scenes were actually not badly crafted. If the story had the depth of The Kadin or Skye O'Malley I think I would have enjoyed this a LOT more."
4,my first Bertrice Small book - NOT my last!,"Loved it - I enjoyed the story, the historical facts and the steamy sex. The way Belle behaved was more realistic in that she was rude to some (not always the Lady) and that she gave in to Guy with pleasure finally, even though she still loved Hugh. I've already bought Skye O'Malley and plan to buy more of Ms. Small's books when I'm in the mood for something a little hotter than Nora Roberts."
1,"I HAVE ONE PHRASE, ""PORNO FLICK""!","This was my first time reading this author and thank goodness it will be my last. I couldn't believe the stuff she thought up. Well, I definateley knew what she was thinking about. For a moment or two I thought it was Madonna writting her own novel. I had to check the cover to make sure this wasn't who I thought it was. If your looking for a good script to a porno movie, this is the book. I would have given it no stars at all, but unfortunatly that wasn't possible."
4,NOT MY FAVORITE BUT INTERESTING READ,I would give it a 3 1/2 star rating if possible. Fairly brutal and not very believable at times but the love does come through. A different theme for a Bertrice Small story which that was nice for a change. I really like her books. I had just read the Love Slave which was much better for me but I still am glad to have read this one. There is enough rough sex and brutality that I am not sure if I could recommend this book unless you really like Bertrice Small. It is an easy read. I am glad to have read it but happy to move on to the next romance book.
3,Voodoo book,"This book was not what I had expected. I am not sure why it has gone out of print either. It does have a lot of really good information. It seems to be one person's accounts, as it was written down, through practice, in a magick book or journal. It is virtually unedited, not much mind to spelling or grammatical syntax, etc. Informationally, on the actual practice of voodoo, and steps required to set it up, this is a good primer. It is not good ""reading"" material about voodoo itself, or its history. The book is not made to be a historical book by any means, if that is what is needed, keep looking."
3,Cute songs.,"This dvd is cute, well know songs, just not very attention seeking for my little girls. The orginal sing along song was more of a hit for our family but it's ok for a quick 15 minute distraction."
1,Big Disappointment,"This program is EXTREMELY slow. I have had no problems running any software programs on my computer (and I own A LOT of them) until I bought this particular program. The graphics and templates are of great quality but the CD continually shuts my computer down and/or takes forever to run, when it does run (and this is not very often). I am constantly e-mailing back and forth with Sierra Software (the manafacturer)...SAVE YOUR MONEY. There are many scrapbooking programs available out there. I think that there were some ""glitches"" that were not worked out by the manafacturer before releasing this program. :-("
3,Fun but hard on knees,"I bought this DVD to hopefully add a new non- or low-impact workout to my routines. This DVD certainly is that - no stomping or jumping required, but there is a lot of twisting and knee work, that even when I use modified motions, it just bothers my knees. (Plain old joint wear and tear from years ago running and high impact aerobics.) That being said, I think if you are able to use it more fully than I am, you will find it to be a pleasant, relaxing, and easy non-aerobic workout."
1,not worth the price,"this stuff,...is average at best. It's sticky,..and it made my hair seperate into chunks of some sort. It was just uncomfortable, for lack of a better word,.to have in my hair. It also made it quite dry."
2,Not a good choice for your first book,"Very complicated introductory language, esp. ch 6 and 7. Nice discussion of industry options (mySQL, Oracle, M$ SQL server, etc.) and options, but not a good introductory text for novices.Need much tighter editing, some figures were missing!"
5,Twist,"Radclyffe keeps making it new and fresh. In this book leading up to 911 she brings in a new way to drive the story, hints. But not the whole story of the hints which makes you want to read more to see how it will all play out.We know what happen that fateful day, but she finds a new way to twist into HER story a fictious story line that works really well. Bravo"
3,This series just drags on,"I like Radclyffe's books, especially when it's not a book in one of her series. When she writes a stand alone book, the characters stand out, but these series just keep dragging on. Here's another Honor book, which it turns out is NOT the final one in the series. It's not a bad story. It's not a good story. It's just another story about the same characters. Cam gets shot.....again. This isn't a spoiler. If you've read this series, she gets shot or hurt in every book. Makes you wonder why she is allowed to stay in the Secret Service. Radclyffe fans will love it and rave about it. If you're looking for something to pass a few hours of reading, this is it, but don't expect anything new."
3,"decent, and good for its price","made strong and finish is good. instructions could be better as it took a while to properly configure legs to balance projector well. once installed, a nice looking unit that will work for most people. note to buyers do what you can to center the circle, and if a leg ends up underneath circle make sure it has clearance before trying to hang unit!!!"
3,Pretty good intro to clerkships,"I bought this book new, and I have to say it really is overpriced for what you get. If you can get it used, or borrow it from your school library then I suppose it is a good read. You can read this book in a couple of hours. It has a lot of common sense things in it like don't show up late, be prepared for rounds, have a good attitude,don't make the nurses mad, read up on your patients, etc. If you feel you need something to help you function ""out in the real world"" then maybe this is the book for you. If you are the person that had a full time job before med school, you can probably pass on this book. First Aid for Wards does a much better job preparing you for 3rd year clerkships."
4,I can't be the only one.,"I received my eb3 and out of the box it had a flaw. It seems, still, to me to be a design flaw. The part of the fence that moves from one side of your saw to the other has a small foot on it. When I set this up to work from the left side of the rip fence, this very small foot would ride up under the small fence that holds it causing the whole thing to rock from side to side. I called Osborne and was met with courtesy and caring. No solution, though. I did, however, find a fix to my problem, two very thin washers on the two bolts that go through the small fence. I have cut, in the last 3 months, dozens of angles right left and sideways. All dead accurate and repeatable. Cut 10 pieces of 2x4 38 1/2 inches. All were exactly identical. I didn't put any real pressure on the extension. Just careful cutting.I am well pleased with my purchase."
2,Needs improvement.,"The darned thing is not flush with my table saw top. I returned the first EB-3 and the replacement is only marginally better. I use it regularly; but it does ""rock"" in the miter gage slot on my Dewalt and I have to be keenly aware of this. Avoid this if you can."
1,shafted by Amazon,After waiting for months I was informed that Amazon no longer carried this item. Thanks for wasting my time. I could have got it some where else. I ordered it because I needed it.
1,Never got the item,"Alas, I wish I could review it before writing this, but I have waited almost 5 weeks, and the ship to date has changed multiple times. It was a supposed to be for a birthday present, but that has long since passed. They say that it is backlogged, but if you call the manufacturer (Excalibur) they say they have plenty in stock. I called Amazon multiple times, but all I got was lip service. I cancelled the order and ordered from Osborne Mfg. I will have it in a day or so."
1,"Shop Fox Router bushings, Porter Cable style.","I bought these to use with my Porter Cable 5116 dovetail jig. In the case of my jig, it uses a 5/8 bushing for half-blind dovetails. More to the point, the 5/8 Porter Cable bushing is an absolute industry standard. This Shop Fox kit is essentially a box full of Porter Cable style bushings.The irony here, is that the Shop Fox bushing is unusable in the very type of jig they were designed for. The outside diameter of the bushing is too wide by a very small amount, i.e. it jams in between the fingers on the jig rather than sliding in and out easily with a very small amount of clearance. I want to like these bushings, but I have to stick with the steel PC bushing.These bushings appear to be nicely machined, unfortunately they are out of tolerance and completely unusable."
4,This books rocks!,"I bought this book in preparation for NCLEX-RN and find it very helpful. Its concise, brief, and staightforward format definitely keeps me interested in using it! This book is a great tool to learn the effective test-taking '""strategies"" However, I do not recommend this book for comprehensive studying. ..."
2,Boring,"The kids are bored to death with this video. It has a lot of stills where someone is reading and if you have hyper kids, this is not your kind of purchase!"
5,Fabulous for entrepreneurs,"Every entrepreneur I've ever known has been a person who could be described as having ADD. And this book, which revisits Hartmann's ground-breaking ADD/Hunter/Farmer theory, and then puts it in the context of business, is one of the best business books *for the entrepreneur* I've ever read. (If you work in an office, 9-5, and like it that way, it's probably not the right book for you. If you want to start your own business, though, this book is the key.)"
2,Looks great when it works,"I'm getting worrried. I bought the TV in February 2006. Recently (July 2006) I've been observing sudden black screens with the TV completely unresponsive to the remote and the TV controls. I have to unplug it and plug it in to get it running again. I have also observed that it is predictable (e.g., always goes black at a particular point in a PVR's show on my cable box (HDMI connection).The latest software update seems to have completely fixed the black screen problem! Hurray!!!!"
1,Do not buy from Philips,"I purchased this t.v. december of 2005 for $2200, great price at the time. It worked great until about a month ago. First the whole screen would go black for a few seconds. Now the whole bottom half goes black for a few minutes every fifteen minutes or so. Phillips denies this problem even though you can find countless accounts of this problem online."
1,Zero stars in my book,"If you are planning on buying this, make sure you google it first add ""red blinking lights"" so you know what to be expecting in a year or two."
1,Piece of junk,"Nice design, but the unit I got had too many problems, which rendered it unusable:1. The fence wouldn't go to 90 degrees.2. When set to zero it still cut about 1/64"".3. The moving part of the sole was angled relative to the fixed part.This is inexcusably shoddy for a tool at this price and with the Bosch name on it."
1,Planer out of plane,"Like many others, I had problems with getting an even plane. Whether it was the soles, blades, or both, the result was removal of 1/32 deeper on the right side of the workpiece. Even with it set on zero, it would take material off the right side only. I need to perform precision tapered planes with successive passes and this really compounds the problem. Me being the sucker that I am, I returned it and ordered a new one only to get one with the same problem. After contacting Bosch tech service, their only suggestion was to take it to a service center. Sorry, I don't think I should have to take a brand new tool to get serviced. Thankfully Amazon has awesome customer service for returns. Bosch blew it on this one."
4,A pretty good planer,"This planer was purchased to do some quick edge planing of a lot of boards; a manual planer would have done the job, but I'd still be at it.The planer blades are ""scary sharp"" and will take off shavings that you can just about see through at the thinnest cuts. Blades are reversable and easy to change, with no complicated alignment procedures. And those blades are pretty tough. I managed to run into a couple of screws while doing the trimming I had to do, and while it didn't do the blade any good, it didn't damage it enough to require a change (at least for the job I was working on.My complaint about this planer (and the reason for dropping one star) is that it isn't ""true"" and the main plate is slightly out of alignment with the blades. It's probably only about 1/64 inch, but enough that you'd notice it after a few passes. It looks like I can remove the plate and shim it a little to bring it to true, so it's not an issue I'm going to return it for."
2,Does not hold up to use every 15 min,"We have had this plainer for a view years and it did occasional jobs but last week we started to use it to take off layers of paint with very thin cuts. The cycle was to run for ~1 min of use then sit for ~15 min. After two days of use it had start up problems and I tracked it to the bearing for the cutter head, once I opened the case up I found that all the bearings in the planer were running rough and some of the plastic around the drive side bearing on the cutter head was melted, so this will be tossed and a new more robust planer will be purchased."
2,They Need To Re-Think The Fence,"Overall the unit is fine, but the fence is made so cheap that you cannot set it to 90 deg. without doing some filing on the slot. This is a very poorly engineered fence and is not like Bosch to put something so cheap on their tools."
3,The Craft & Order of Knights,"Not a bad analysis, on the craft & order of Knights; good insight and well organized, but the quintessential book on the Templars would have to be Wasserman's ""The Templars and the Assasins"" it tells of the true Templar evolution to the fullest. Two good companions would also be ""African Origins of Freemasonry' by Zachary Gremillion (2005) & ""The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present"" by Noble Timothy Myers-El (2005)"
5,BEST JEANS EVER,"I love these jeans. Because of the little bit of spandex they put in, they are so comfortable. But please, get more of the ""bleach"" back in stock in the larger sizes so I can buy some more.I did a review on full-length jeans. Why is there now a photo of capris here? What's going on?"
4,Good book,"This was our first book we read for our newly formed Bible Study/ Women's Book club at our church. It was a hit and everybody thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a chapter or two that was just ""ok"", but the rest of it made a lot of sense. Our book club is mostly new moms or moms with younger children."
5,"Mystery, mayhem and a monster to boot!","What a great mix of genres! Tabloid news, mystery, a hint of science fiction and all tremendously entertaining. It is the perfect book to take down to the beach -- or out by the lake -- and just enjoy. Nothing too challenging, just good clean fun and a tale well told with interesting characters, settings and a plot line that will keep you on your toes, Highly recommended for all"
1,Completely inappropriate for kids,"I completely agree with the other reviewers. My daughters (5 & 2) received this as a gift and we were all completely shocked by the horrific storylines. They were so negative and disturbing that my husband and I decided they are not allowed to watch this DVD. The title ""Beauty Shines From Within"" is totally deceiving, as the stories are anything but beautiful. The only one that was even decent was the Cinderella one, which was of poor quality and ""pieced together."" I ended up giving my girls a very early Christmas present of the Cinderella DVD to replace this one, and it is so much better it's not even comparable. Our whole family enjoys the Cinderella one. It's just too bad Disney has put so much other garbage out there - it makes me really think twice before buying any more Princess DVDs."
1,Warning: May Induce Nightmares,"I'm usually pretty careful about what I let my 4 and 2 year old daughters watch. Beauty Shines From Within sounded harmless enough. The back of the box mentioned fun tales about Ariel, Cinderella and Jasmine. The description on the box failed to mention that Jasmine is turned into a red eyed, fanged, spike tailed giant hooded green snake by a shape shifting evil sorceress cat person. Thanks, Disney. That's what I get for not previewing the movie first. When my 28 month old came up to me in the kitchen and asked me why Jasmine had red eyes and told me she was scared, I went in to see what was going on. I got there as Aladdin decided that if his true love was going to live life as a snake, so was he, so he rubbed the magic lotion on himself and became a giant, pupil-less blue snake. I guess that's true love for ya. These images are going to stick around in my household for awhile (they tend to pop back up at bedtime, imagine that)."
2,MAL GIULINI,"Esta versión de los Cuadros de Mussorgsky es realmente aburrida, Giulini maneja un tempo muy lento y una concepción carente de expresión, que diferencia con su versión anterior, con la Chicago SO en DGG. En Chicago, Giulini nos deja completamente satisfechos, pero ésta versión en Sony, es terriblemente decepcionante.Este es un disco para obviar.Pssst...

5,worth the money!,I received this blanket as a shower gift and we love it! I washed it right away because I noticed a large amount of white lint coming off of it. It washed well! I dryed it in the dryer on low. All of the lint that it came with is off and the blanket is as soft and adorable as it was when I unwrapped it at my shower!!
5,A MUST FOR EVERY STAR WARS FAN!!!!,"I picked this up for $20AUS and was totally blown away. The quality of the tracks are excellent, and it is just the thing to flick on while you are reading a good star wars book. Its good music at a great price. If i could i would give it 6/5 stars"
3,"good book, but...","FYI - 145 pages of this book are dedicated to recipes. And in a book that's only 311 pages, 145 pages is nearly half the content. If you can't cook, the recipes are practical, easy to make, tasty dishes. If you can cook (that's me), the rest of the book will still provide you with an interesting and concise (sometimes too much so) read covering banking, security, home repairs, loans, contracts, buying a car, and travel tips."
5,Wonderful love story,This book was written in 1997 but I just found it in a Used Book Store and I'm glad I did. The author makes the main characters very real with real strengths and weaknesses. It is a very touching love story. I really loved the epilogue where Analisa finds and reads Charlie's diary. That actually brought tears to my eyes.
3,a fascinating life,"but the boucing back in forth in time during the book made it choppy reading. Still, a good story!"
2,Same Old Stuff,"The author admits he as little knowledge in this field. Author appears to know more on Ritual magick. Writes from an ""outsiders"" view point. Stating what others told him. The book is filled with information taken from other books. Nothing new here. Author futher admits he is a total failure in life. Living in a Trailer, Sick and on Welfare. I think there are better sources to learn from. It does have a nice collection of Seals. Saves you from locating the books they were taken from."
2,Buyer beware!,"I bought all three levels in a one-pack. On closer examination it became clear to me that the books had tone-mark mistakes on every page, plus Taiwanese characters understood by a mere 23 million as opposed to 1.4billion Chinese on the mainland had been used throughout. The company said it was aware of the problem and would put it right. A year or so later I received a replacement product. Unfortunately it was the wrong product. Incar learning or something. Vocabulearn, I was informed would not be changed.They are aware it's very poor quality but continue to put it out. Draw your own conclusions."
5,mandy patinkin,I love all the songs and i know mandy patinkin . he sing very good and he also is actor . i always see he in concerts when he do them in new york
2,i'm obviously in the minority here,"it's not that temple is a bad writer. it could be that i've read to many 'hard-boiled' mysteries over the years.the plot is well handled, and it's the typical convoluted genre plot. i guessed most of the elements well ahead of the writing. the identity of the love interest was obvious, too. and inexplicable.the jack irish character is also typical--the tragic occurance in his past (from which he should have recovered), the borderline job, the suggestion of possibly shady dealings. i don't know much about betting, so i couldn't tell if his involvement in the betting scheme was legal and ethical, legal and unethical, or just plain criminal. i didn't think him tough or mean, since most of his actions were reactions. i found him fairly interchangeable with other hard-boiled anti-heroes.i wouldn't recommend this author, but i am in the minority."
5,TR Revealed,"This is, simply put, a superb biography of Theodore Roosevelt. Dalton is a careful scholar who manages both to narrate with verve and style an incredible life and to do so with keen attention to historical realities. A professional historian, unlike many popular biographers of Roosevelt, Dalton integrates an enormous range of modern historical research and knowledge into her interpretation of Roosevelt. But she does so without ever straying from the compelling human tale she has to tell. A book that neither romanticizes nor underestimates the significance of this fascinating President, Dalton's study provides readers with a thorough and compassionate understanding of Roosevelt as politician and man."
2,"Historical details good, but plot needs some work.","Actually I'd give this book 2 1/2 stars. The settings and everyday details of life in Joseph of Arimathea's world are so descriptive I felt like I was really there. But the author uses coincidence too much as a plot device. She also introduces details that seem unbelievable. Example: Ella tells others that at age 8 (or so) she ""didn't know about God""--what? A child raised in a Jewish household two millenia ago didn't know about God? Also, NONE of the Phoenicians Joseph sailed with for years as a young man EVER find out that he has befriended the Celts, for which the (implied) punishment would have been Joseph's death. I also tired of reading about Joseph's sexual (mis)adventures--a lot of that seemed added in for titillation. Read this book for its fascinating historical backdrop, not the storyline."
3,Two different colors = two different metals?,"My Raptor S12-50 came from Amazon, not a Marketplace seller. I was surprised to find that unlike the wire shown in the main photo for this product (which to me looks like it's all the same color), half of the wire I received is one color (copper) and half is another (silver). Shouldn't exactly the same metal be used for both wires? Some kind of marking to help users avoid mixing up the polarities is useful, of course, but using different metals seems odd to me. If you know and understand this stuff better than I do, please leave a comment and enlighten me. For now I feel comfortable withholding two stars simply because the product package provides no explanation and as a result I'm spending time trying to find one on the web."
3,Shorted,"Pretty inexpensive wire compared to some other brands, but does the job OK. I'm no audiophile, so I can't tell the difference. Only thing that makes me give it a 3 rating is that, as another poster had mentioned, I don't think I got 50 feet of wire. I only needed about 47-48 feet and I was short by a couple feet! I never actually measured it, but by what I needed it was obvious that the spool didn't contain 50'. Otherwise, buying thru Amazon makes it easy, especially with free shipping over $25. I couldn't find 12GA wire at any of the 'big box' stores like Best Buy or Circuit City."
2,Disappointed...,"The disc holder itself is attractive and functional. However, the papers sold to burn with it have an awful odor. It's been rendered useless to us."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Thought I was getting Halo 1,2 &3 but what I got was 1, 2 and #2Maps. When I questioned it, I never got a reply. So when I tried to returning it, the window had closed (it was only 14 days). They wouldn't even just give me credit for another purchase. Also, the disk packages had someone's name on them, and their not downloadable to my hard drive. Poor products, poor customer service, I'll never buy from them again."
5,Thoughts from a schoolmate of Borden Deal,"I attended Enterprise School with Borden Deal in the thirties, he was known as ""Little Red"" and was constantly reading from the severly limited book collection.For anyone interested in life in the deep south during the depression there could be no better source than ""The Other Room"", although it is classed as fiction most of it is taken from real life. Borden used the real name of many of his chacters and where he changed the name most are easily recognized. I can identify most of the characters and am related to many. This book is a ""must read""Carroll Hale"
4,The Other Room,This book arrived from the seller promptly and in the good condition that I expected. I am enjoying the bookwritten by a Mississippi author who lived for a time near my north Mississippi home. I'm very pleased with thispurchase from Amazon.
3,"Interesting history, but not complete enough","Purchased this book in the hope that it would have information not presviously acquired elsewhere. But, it came up somewhat short although it was not a total loss. Contains some insight that was of some value in my search for understanding what happened at Salisbury."
3,Moody sanctuary,"Magna Canta made a moody CD with Santuary. But playing it completely, it is very much of the same. Nevertheless, it is worth buying if you like this genre"
3,Not quite as advertised,This is a nice looking case; much better than the one that came with the unit. But it doesn't really stand very well.
5,Top Dog,THIS GUY NEED TO BE NUMBER ONE IN RNB SINGERS.WE NEED MORE SINGERS LIKE HIM WHAT A GREAT VOICE AND SONGS.EVERBODY NEED TO HEAR HIM HE'S LIKE NO OTHER.HE IS THE NEW CURTIS MAYFIELD.
3,Entertaining but he needs an editor!,"This book is the second one by him that I have read, and he still is turning out entertaining books with some good points. However, he needs an editor to tighten it up. A lot of his book is showing off what he knows about Asia, and he presents essentially a 2-dimensional version of the past. He knows more than most, but his plot and characters are only a small step above typical stereotypes: the tough but smart Marine with the tough but beautiful daughter, the techie guy who really is cool and gets the tough but beautiful daughter, the smart quick-thinking sales guy, the ""wacky but sexy"" cryptographer and the ""inscrutable"" Asian characters we always see in the mass media.Still, it's a fun read. Hopefully, he will let himself be edited!"
4,Clever and highly entertaining,"This will never be a literary classic, but it's a fantastic story. The complex interweaving of plots is wonderful, the myriad tangents are an entertaining distraction. Modern readers (especially sci-fi readers) are used to trim, linear novels, so this is an archaic and uncomfortable format for some of the less flexible.I'd give it a five if the characters had depth or the novel as a whole had been profound. Frankly, I think Stephenson's geekiness is pretty glaring in these respects. The female characters are all utterly inscrutable and their desires/behavior apparently random (do women really seem that way to you, man?). The men, while better developed, still tend to me more charactures than characters.Still, the utterly brilliant language use and the multi-layered, overlapping stories give this novel high entertainment value. It'll make you laugh out loud with delight. In my opinion, one of the best novels of 1999."
1,Is there an Editor in the house?,Although this book's premise is engaging I find wading through his murky prose at times unbearable. His style often makes me think he gets paid by the word. He remains a writer in desperate need of a editor. Also there are typos in the book a spell checker would catch.
5,More Power to Dwarves!!,"Possibly the best book I've ever read. (I'll need to read it a couple more times to make sure.)Laughed so loud I woke (notoriously narcoleptic) family members in distant rooms.LOVED the dwarf analogy. Always considered myself an elf, but Neal's theorum does a lot to explain my waistline. (But we know who REALLY made the rings of power.)Snow Crash was a joy, The Diamond Age was brilliant (if a little slow), but Cryptonomicon is Stephenson's very own killer app.Thankyou."
4,"Good ride, destination no so","The most laugh-out-louds since Catch-22. The individual chapters are outstanding for literary style, technical knowledge and historical background (e.g., wood burning cars in England during WW2). The ending, though, had the feel that an editor had to ask for something to tie all the stories together.It's a big book for many satisfying hours of reading."
1,much weaker than Stephenson's other work,"I consider Snow Crash the best cyberpunk novel ever. Diamond Age was a bit weaker but still good. After reading the others I ran out to buy this book. Cryptonomicon is much weaker than these earlier works. The pace is slow and Snow Crash has more creative ideas on one page than this whole book on 400+ pages. I ended up selling it which I almost never do. I disagree with some of the other reviewers. I'm a computer guy too (working in the networking area) but this book doesn't have much to offer to hackers or ""computer scientists""."
4,"Dazzling! Long, but well worth the read.","Very impressive in that it's decidedly non-cyberpunk.The WWII scenes were witty and gritty. The present day scenes had all of the wonder and paranoia needed to keep them alive and interesting.I've been reading NS (& SB) from the beginning and I'm delighted to see that his prose chops work as well with the historical epic as they do with the sci-fi cyber world of the near future.IMHO, one of our generation's most gifted writers.Read Cryptonomicon. Read it now."
1,Math textbook or fictional novel?,"I did not think this book was poorly written, but I did think the story was dry as day-old toast. Unless you're extremely interested in math, and you don't mind Neal Stephenson sounding a bit like he's trying to impress us all with just how much high-level math he understands, then read this book, otherwise I wouldn't bother."
4,Cryptonomincon,"Stephenson did a great job with telling the story of encrytion from WW2 up to and including what the near future holds. The book could of been about 150 pages shorter, but still keeps the readers attention. The story goes back and forth between 2 men and their 2 grandkids in different times in history. Although this can be confusing sometimes, the ideas and concepts, like all Stephenson's work, is very timely. The hope for a ""data haven"" is something that is in the mind of every person, or will be after reading this book. All in all it's a very witty, real, and great written story. We'll see if he decides to make a series out of it."
4,heard it all before but...,"Like all the other Stephenson books I've read, I get the feeling that I've read this book before. I just can't put my finger on where.Beyond the feeling that this work isn't original, it is a fun read. While I never loved the characters, and the plot never dazzled me, it was alot better than any other book I've read in awhile."
5,To all adoring fans of Neal Stephenson--,"If you love Stephenson as much as I do, then I want to share with you another incredible author whom I find equally brilliant--Glenn Kleier. His novel, THE LAST DAY, is every bit the rush of unexpected thrills, whiplashing plot twists, and nerve-shattering suspense that is Stephenson. It was a great delight to find another author I could enjoy as much."
4,Cryptonomicon - 5 star cryptography with a big BUT,"CQI have worked in cryptography off and on for going on 25 years and this book, in my opinion, is the best approximation of the field in the novel form. To me this was a five star read, BUT I expect that for readers without a current subscription to Cryptologica it might be considered a difficult read.I would therefore rate it with 5 stars for those with a computer science and cryptography background, 4 stars for those with a computer science background alone, and 3 stars for those willing to dedicate the time to learn both on the fly.GVS OM"
2,1st half: brilliant; 2nd half: severely wanting,"This novel starts off as a brilliant exploration of determinism and randomness. The characters bounce from one part of the 2nd World War to another, often with little idea as to why they've been told to do the things they've been ordered to do. The whole aura of the writing is distinctly Pynchonesque, although with not as much satire.But, by the end of the 1st half of the book, Stephenson's origins as a thriller writer really start to come to the fore. It seems that he can't help but put in a rather cheesy plotline about treasure-finding. A disappointment after such high hopes."
3,where the hell was his editor?,"This is a good book. It could have been great, if someone had reminded the author that clever one-liners and facile ""set pieces"" do not a story make. I wish he had spent more time on the characters, and less on a three page exposition about how to eat Captain Crunch cereal."

1,Plenty of pain but no gain,The only thing I can find to praise about this book is consistency. It's about as engrossing after page 10 as it is after page 890. (& I kept thinking it had to get better!) This is shear pointless verbosity without a single human-like character or sympathetic plot element. Stephenson can just about make the reader not care about the outcome of WWII.
1,"Very Long, Very Boring","Snowcrash was a work of rare brilliance. Cryptonomicon is a dull and plodding rehash of obscure historical events, poorly narrated. While there is some gold here (literally and figuratively) the work to dig it out far exceeds the meager rewards... I suggest another book..."
1,Poor Abridgement?,"I heard the audio book version. It was a poor job of condensation. I cannot tell whether I'd like the underlying book, but the audio version fails to link the events, skips through things that are apparently important to the story line, and glosses over much of the character definition. The features of the book that are lauded in the reviews are not present in the audio version."
5,Stephenson is as capable a writer as he is a techie. AMAZING,"Throughout this 900+ page masterpience, Stephenson challenges the reader's mind, and their ability to sleep! I often found myself so enthralled by the problems (mathmatical and logistical) faced by the protagonist, that I would often stay awake for hours in bed, trying to work them out. It was a great book, well worth the read, and I can't wait for his next."
4,"Full of ideas, short on plot, loads of fun!","This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age."
1,"Lots of promise, never gets going","This is the first book I have ever failed to finish. This is out of thousands upon thousands of books, I read nearly continually. I've read long meandering epics etc. and loved them, but this one just did not have anything going for it.I only made it to page 300 and the entire time I was wondering when a plot was going to be presented to the reader, a central story. A REASON to keep reading beyond just reading about these completely separated characters in two different time periods. I kept thinking that the story was going to get started after the author introduced the characters a bit more, but at page 300 I realized that this was all the book was going to be . . . character introduction and lots of it.Maybe these characters all tie together in a wonderful and thought provoking way around page 1000 or so, but I'll never know because the author never gave me a reason to want to find out."
5,This book (though long) is exeedingly good!,"The cryptonomicon is so engrossing, I read it in a matter of days! I really suggest it. I read a lot of Niven, and i find all of neal stephonson's books to have the same exellent quality to them..."
2,"Stephenson's editors should be fired, quickly","I have no comment about the content. The length, however, is unforgivable. This work was 50% longer than necessary, and Stephenson suffers for it. Bad editors, bad!"
2,dull and self important,"Plain and simply, this book is a chore to read. The concepts are interesting, but Stephensons digressions into math theory or the minutiae of business start-up planning or the neurosis of post-structuralist academics are overly detailed, self important, and dull. Many of the main characters are not developed. In the case of the nearly autistic math genius Waterhouse, this is perhaps a literary mechanism. In the case of the other characters it is unforgivable. In addition the women in the book are one dimensional, they only exist as objects of sexual interest for the men. So think twice before buying this book."
4,An ex-cryptographer's review,"During my military service I served as a cryptographer. Up till now I've never viewed the work I did as exciting, but after having read this book I've changed my perspectives.You can clearly tell that Neil Stephenson has done quite a lot of research in the field of cryptography and I feel perfectly at home with the plot and the details. Sure, it's imaginative, speculative; at certain points bordering on the paranoid, but that's just the way I want Neil Stephenson's books to be. More adjectives? Okay. Smart, futuristic. That goes without saying when talking about Neil Stephensons books.Oh, by the way: if you're an entrepreneur it will fill your head with cool ideas and wild perspectives. Beware!"
1,really liked his previous work,"such as Zodiac (a little rough, but his first novel), Snowcrash and the Diamond Age. I have re-read Snowcrash twice and The Diamond Age 4 times.Struggled through this one, hoping that eventually it would start to have some sort of cohesion that would bring it all together. Never happened for me. I did enjoy some of the details and side tangents, but they never really factored into any of the story threads.Finally finished it and then realized that around 200-300 pages in I had the insight that it was not really going to go anywhere - should have gone with that and abandoned at that point. And yes, I am a computer geek/professional with interests in encryption so it should have been a rewarding read. No dice."
4,Long novels pay off,"If you care to put the time into reading it, ""Cryptonomicon"" will blow your mind. It's true that nobody ever accused Neal Stephenson of being shortwinded, but the man definitely has something to say. This book tied three stories of war, code-breaking, and hacking into one cohesive narrative. Everything tied together. Everything. It wrapped up a little too succintly in the end for my taste, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The portions concerning the Pacific theater in World War II were particularly interesting because I knew almost nothing about it. I don't expect to read this again any time soon, but I will absolutely continue to recommend it."
5,Favorite Gloves,"I had an old pair of these gloves given to me, and I loved them. After I lost one of them, I just had to get another pair. I like to hunt with them because they are warm and soft, very soft, so it is easy to feel the trigger even while wearing them. Luckily, I got my new pair, which I love, and while I was out hunting, my buddy found the old glove that I had dropped. Now I have a ""good pair"" and an ""everyday pair""!!!"
1,Buy one of his other books!,"I am a HUGE fan of Mr. Cook's and have read every single one of his other books that are still in print. So I looked forward to this one with eager anticipation. It is just dreadful. I cannot believe it was even written by the same man who wrote the Chatham School Affair or Breakheart Hill. It is mawkish, amateurish and a couple of other -ish that don't immediately spring to mind. Poorly written, an unbelievable plot, awkward in concept and execution. Buy one of this man's other books and you will be hooked, but I'm afraid this one is a turkey."
3,Digital errors,"A good read occasionally spoiled by a glitch in digital transposition. One reads along expecting the hero to take a ""deep bream"" or is it breath? It might be a fish but reading on, one realizes that the scanner cannot change fonts. And so the mood, so carefully constructed by the author is lost to confusion or comedy. Worth the price, but the paperback may be the better choice."
3,Someone help me to understand!,"Who murdered Faye Harrison? I still don't know if that was clear. Was it her mother? The book held my interest, but was rather convoluted. It made allusions to the Holocaust, so the sadism that was constantly referred to must have been been connected to that unspeakable time."
5,The Best Cigar Book Ever Written - It Smokes!!,"I'm enjoying an Ashton Cabinet right now as I write this review in the predawn hours of Christmas Day 2000. I can't say enough about this book. I spent north of $1500 buying cigars and related stuff before I read this book, much of which could have been better spent had I read it first.Richard, beyond being the consumate cigar afficianado, is a likeable guy, and has a great sense of humor. For instance, when discussing how to smoke a cigar and the ash that forms at the end, he refers to this as ""leaving the Mother Ship"". What a funny guy!The best parts: 1) How to light a cigar (stop offending others by doing it right, 2) The comprehensive list of brands in the back, which offers not only great info but a nice shopping list upon your next trip to the tobacconist.This is a guy I would love to enjoy a cigar and a fine port with, discussing his many cigar adventures. Buy this book!"
2,bang!,"Had it for a month, liked it for the most part, but the picture seemed a bit shaky... after a month or so, there was a loud static crack and the picture went out. I don't think I would be comfortable recommending this model."
4,Fun nostalgia with a real slant,"This is one of those movies you might happen uponon a lazy sunday flipping through TV channels, which is how I first discovered it. I thought it would be some silly teenage romp, but found it to be much more. While is is great to see the fashion, slang and ideas of the era, ""Where the Boys Are"" shows us four different college girls who experence spring break very differently.As each girl meets and tries to snag her dream-boy, we're taken along on the courtship and fun. The brooding George Hamilton and the kooky Bill Hutton keep the girls om their toes.The sad story line of Yvette Mimeux as the pretty girl who doesn't know her worth and suffers because of it is a surprising and touching addition.All in all, I give it a 4-star rating amd suggest it for slumber parties, sick days and rainy days when this glimpse into the sunny 60s Ft. Lauderdale. A lot of fun!"
3,fun movie,"Typical movie - fun, surf, very reminscent of it's genre. Not bad for a rainy Sunday viewing.If you view the 1980's version...it's hard to believe that each era's interpretation can change so drastically, but still have the similar plotlines. The 1980's version of the movie is funnier."
5,A Great music for those who want to know more about the industry and the Fatman.,"Reviewing this book is very easy. If you ever played Wing Commander or 7th Guest or 11th Hour, you know the Fatman. You know what he is capable of. But you don't know his story... This book is a great modern story told by the Fatman himself, a story with ups and downs, with drama and comedy and heroic american moments, and even better, its all a true story. If you ever wonder what does it mean to be a game composer, a music composer, a musician, even more than that, to live your dream, read this book. It won't teach you how to be the best in the business, it will teach you that whatever you do, put your heart in it. The Fatman has been around computer games since the beginning, and hopefully he will continue in this field till the end. Long live the Fatman... this book really inspired me to follow my dream and be a musician."
5,the fatman rules,"This a hilarious, and wonderful book from one of the legends of game audio. Full of gems of wisdom about getting things done in the game business. If you have an interest in game soundtracks, learn from the master!"
5,Darling aprons,"I ordered four of these aprons in different patterns for my daughter and daughters-in-law for Christmas gifts this year and wasn't disappointed. The fabric is darling and sturdy, the colors as depicted in the online pics and the construction was excellent. I only wish I had ordered one for myself - which I will probably still do. I scoured the internet for something like this and these were the cutest ones I found and at the most reasonable price. Highly recommend!"
3,Cleat comments,"So far so good, as it relates to function. 8"" might have been better choice since it has slip thru feature for lines, not present on 3 and 6"" models. Easy to install and attractive on dock."
2,Too scary,"I agree with some of the other reviewers--it's a rip-off! The original Heffalump movie was so fresh and original, and then they take their wonderful new character and do a flash back.This movie scared my almost three-year-old to the point where she won't dress up to go trick-or-treating and yesterday, when we went for a walk, she was convinced the trees had ""mouths with teeth"" and were going to get her!It may be entertaining for slightly older kids, but keep it away from the littler ones. :("
5,pooh's heffalump halloween movie,"Bought this simply for Tigger's ""I want to scare myself"" song. It's a good movie for all. My 7 yr old son loved pooh, tigger, piglet and heffalump doing Halloween."
2,Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie,"Kinda out dated...most of it scared my 3 year old too. I wouldn't recommend it...the cover makes it look newer than it is....it's not the animation that we're used to, like with My Friends Tigger and Pooh."
1,Love Lumpy... hate Pooh's Heffalump Halloween movie,"We were so excited to get this for our 2 year old because he LOVES the other Pooh movie with Lumpy in it. So when it arrived, we sat down as a family and watched it. My husband and I were both kind of confused. It is so different than the tone of the other movie. The whole tone of this movie was sad and scared. There was nothing fun loving in it at all. Lumpy doesn't want to celebrate because everything scares him... so he shivers, whimpers, and cries over EVERYTHING, ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. It was depressing lol. Our little boy did not enjoy it. He didn't smile once, he just looked concerned the whole time and after a while just wanted us to turn it off. We were really bummed, I don't think we will be watching this one again."
3,Poo's Hefffalump movie,"This is an amusing film, but not one that my daughter was interested in viewing again."
3,dvd is clear,"does what it says it does. Gives you alternatives to forcing a car. Again essential skill if you plan to do any significant card magic. Will require a lot of practice, this is not ""easy""."
2,"like the Care Bears, but movie was missing something","This film, while well intended to teach small children what it is to care, could do alot more. This is the first Care Bears video I have seen in years. But it taught my 2 year old, the word Dummy! In the story titled ""Birthday"" one of the kids spills cake batter on the other accidentally, and the other kid calls him a dummy. Personally, I think they could have worked that out of the script. I have to fast forward through it so neither of my two children(both under 2 years old) hear that part. Also, Bedtime bears voice does sound bad in it, and a couple others not so good."
5,No commercials!,Dead Files is a favorite of mine. I use the DVR to record the episodes to watch and re-watch. I was so happy to find season one and eagerly await the release of more.
2,"Bare bones DVD, typical network offering","This is not only the best paranormal show that has ever been on TV, it is by miles the most convincing portrayal of ""psychic"" abilities I've ever seen. The show comes off totally genuine, not contrived, like most garbage of the genre. Our family loves this show to death.The DVD presentation is about as average as could be, and sadly quite expected from a siily network that only airs the show once a week while lesser crap (read Ghost Adventures) runs all the time. There are no extras of any kind to be found on the DVD, all they did was print what has been broadcast and slap it into a crappy, ugly, completely uninspired package design.Glad to have it, but Travel Channel could not have put LESS effort into the presentation of this phenomenal show. Lame effort.I'm giving it a 2 out of 5, because I didn't buy a digital download, I bought an entire package and the company should put a better effort into their product."
4,Good start for non-engineering students,"This book provides a good start point to study computer hardwares for people at any levels, including those who don't have engineering background. It is easy to read and understand the contents. I like this book."
2,It's just ok,"When I purchased this CD, I was thinking it would be a good one to go to sleep with, but found that was not the case. Alot of the music in it has alot of beat, and base, which is not helpful to fall asleep to. This is not what I was expecting with this CD."
3,"Uneven, but contains gems","This collection of short stories showed me that, while I adore Mieville as a novel writer, I'm less fond of him as a short story author. Written between 1998 and 2005, these stories range from the incomprehensible (Foundation) to the fascinating (Reports of Certain Events in London) to the funny (Tis the Season) to the seriously creepy (Familiar) to the will-this-never-end (The Tain). There is even one set in New Crobuzon, the world of `Perdido Street Station', a very good story. Mieville fans will find something to like and even love in this collection, despite its unevenness."
3,"Fantastic, but not always coherent","I'll say one thing about China Miéville's writing - it certainly isn't any shade of ordinary.He does an amazing job of making things truly fantastic in his stories, and that isn't always a good thing. When the better part of reading a story is spent trying to figure out what in the heck he is actually having characters or creatures make references to, it detracts from the telling of said story. ""The Tain"" - the longest of the stories collected - suffers from this quite deeply, as it takes nearly half the story to get to the point where the reader isn't merely being bombarded with descriptions of the bizarre and fantastical and can attempt to piece together exactly what it means with regard to some semblance of plot.I do like how the majority of his stories tend to veer toward horror - where things are SO fantastic that they begin to apall vice merely amaze."
1,Disturbing.,"This horrible book is about a father who lies, & a man who dresses like a clown, robs a bank, & smokes a $50 cigar to celebrate, & a poor dog strapped to a ""fart catcher"" and can't get away. Don't buy this book."
5,Kick Back and Laugh!,"If you enjoyed the first ""Walter the Farting Dog,"" you'll fall off your chair laughing at this second book in the series. William Kotzwinkle's imagination is one to admire to come up with such a creative and cute use of a bodily function that we all have to address at some point in our lives. If you're offended by farts, don't buy the book. But if you have grown up in an environment where you can joke about these acts of nature, you'll laugh you head off while reading this book! I say, ""Laugh, and laugh out loud!"""
1,Terrible,"Let's see.....Dad sells the family dog for $10 at a yard sale behind the children's backs, an evil, cigar-smoking clown robs a bank- I don't know about you but this is definitely not a book I would read my 6 year old."
1,The name says it all,"I expected something goofy, that would make the kids laugh like the Captain Underpants series. But this book had a stupid story, and the pictures were so ugly! The kids really were not impressed with it, so it will be going to our yardsale this year!"
3,"""D"" for dull","After having San Egal as one of my favorite albums. I special ordered ""D"" obtaining a used copy. I was sorely disappointed. It does not have the same rythmic characteristics of previous albums.To me. ""D"" is for dull or disappointing. Save your money and get an earlier Tarika album."
3,Sounds like English speakers,I wonder if this is an English speaker speaking Swahili. This doesn't work for me like the typical language lesson plan book.
5,This is fun!,"A great album to have for enthusiasts of music and movies. If you don't want to hunt down and buy every score to every movie Spielberg and Williams collaborated on, THIS is the album for you!!!"
3,Cute short kick off games for a meeting,See above....some are very good...most are to fill up the book
4,The Expected Hero,"Paul Addison has written a competent introduction to a life more interesting, in the sense of history, than any other of the twentieth century. His book is enlivened by many vivid quotes from a broad assortment of people who had reason to know Winston Churchill. However, I think the author, in an excessive attempt at balance, bends too far over backward in making use of certain highly negative assessments-- such as one offered by Evelyn Waugh at the time of Churchill's death.While he may have had feet of clay, his name remains remembered in Westminister Abby--and elsewhere over the globe."
4,"Poetry not for you? Read ""What We Carry!""","I came to this book as someone who had no patience for poetry. It was something that always bored me in junior high, and that boredom never let up. I think I've repressed most of it, but I still get haunted by memories of iambic pentameter, sonnets, metaphor, synesthaesia, metonymy, yada yada yada. So I was very suspicious when a friend handed me this book and said it was ""nothing"" like the poems I'd read in junior high. Much to my surprise, though, she was right! There's no metaphors or similies, no ""prosody"" or rhetorical structure, etc. You get the sense Ms. Laux is just like me, unable to see what (if any) relevance Dickinson or Pound or Keats or the rest of those boring old guys and girls have for poetry. Instead, these are GOOD poems, about feelings and emotions. Look at the title poem--there's not one metaphor in it! I love it, and I've pasted it on the rear window of my Chevette for all the world to see! WE NEED MORE POEMS LIKE IT!"
2,A wooden life of an anything but wooden saint,"Philip Neri is an astonishingly attractive Renaissance Saint. Friend of Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, friend of the great and powerful, and of the eccentric and the poor.V.J. Matthews is a dull writer. But even he cannot mask the quirkiness, the good humor and the bubbling humanity of a holy man whom inhabitants of Rome have always held in high regard.A good example: the last paragraph of the book:""On March 12, 1622, the jealous citizens of Rome were saying that that morning in S. Peter's the Pope--it was Gregory XV--had canonized 'four Spaniards and a Saint!' The ""Spaniards"" were Isadore the farmer of Madrid, Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier and Teresa of Avila--no less. The ""Saint,' of course, was Rome's second Apostle, Philip Neri.""This is a useful short biography of the much neglected Saint whom John Henry Newman found so attractive that he introduced the Oratory of St Philip Neri to England in the late 1840s."
5,Great book. It tells it as it happened.,We both worked for Pan Am as a flight attendant and pilot / Skygod. We met on a South American trip and are still together.
2,Rusts very easily,"These racks are solid and sturdy and the stacking is a good idea, but rust appeared at the soldering points after the first wash.After the first wash I left the wet cooling racks in a dishrack to air-dry. A few hours later I found the racks had dripped rust-colored spots onto some of my other dishes. Reddish water had gathered at nearly all the points where the bars criss-cross each other. After the second wash, this got even worse and I was afraid they would leave red spots on the white cookies I was baking. I didn't end up using these cooling racks again.Basic kitchenware like this shouldn't need to be coddled. It shouldn't start oozing rusty water just because you didn't carefully hand-dry all its little crevices."
5,A snap to put together,"Yesterday I received the racks from Amazon, washed them, let them dry well and put them together. As I am mechanically challenged :-) putting anything together is a real chore. These racks were easy to put together and they look nice sitting on my cupboard. Based on previous experience with similar racks, I would not put anything heavy on the top rack. The bottom rack should be adequate for heavier baked goods while the top rack should be able to support baked cookies or rolls.The racks themselves are made of sturdy metal covered with a nonstick coating. I noticed no rusting after the racks were washed and dried. I will update this review, if I notice any rusting.Overall, pleased with the design and construction of these baking racks.Recommend."
2,Okay in the absence of other sources,The 1980's Fashion Sourcebook was somewhat useful as there is little else written about such a recent decade. Original sources (internet) were more helpful although more time consuming. Peacock's drawing style has always been difficult to translate to real bodies and the small size of the publication and the faint color make it even less helpful as a costume design research tool.
1,Denver Junior League Is Past Its Prime,"With their fourth cookbook, the Denver Junior League has gone off the deep end. I own and use regularly their first three books, so it was natural for me to buy this one as soon as it came out. Alas! They've lost touch with their audience. There are too many recipes with ingredients difficult to find outside of large urban areas. And why so much focus on seafood from a group in the Rockies? Seems as if the good ladies are trying too hard to identify with the San Francisco ""nouvelle"" cooking crowd. This book is going into my rummage sale box."
5,An excellent choice,"This is an album that will not disappoint. Even though it is not as heavy as recent releases, it is still an excellent album. There is not one throw-away track on here; it is too hard to pick a favorite song because they are all good. Prong definitely does not disappoint, even though they don't get the exposure they deserve."
5,Excellent learning toy!,"My son loves these toys and after 2 days was able to identify all of them. This is definitely a great way to reinforce learning. As a matter of fact, I played a youtube video of a giraffe & elephant and he was able to point to the tv and say them both out loud while pointing. I'm continually impressed my the products put out by Learning Resources. Some complain about the scale but I feel the details help children learn identification. (It is funny to see the dog & cat from a separate Learn Res. animal set the equivalent size as the elephant and gorilla) The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating for durability was the tail on the elephant looks like it could be pulled out as a child grows. Otherwise they are realistic looking for learning purposes."
1,SENT WRONG PRODUCT. I did not get the product I paid for,Did not get what I paid for. You sent me the wrong product and I have not heard any word from you on how you plan to correct this error on your path
2,Disappointment,"I loved the bag, but the clamp holding the backpack-strap broke after 1-week of usage."
2,Very confusing and hard to understand...,"""Spades for Winners"" is very long, very difficult to read, and very boring. I am 12 years old, trying to learn the game of Spades. I read another spades book, and really liked it. It was really an awesome way to learn the beginners' rules..Then I wanted to learn more about the game. My sister gave me a copy of Fleishman's Book, and I was not able to get past the first few chapters. I felt like I was reading some of my Dad's technical work manuals. He is an engineer, and he was also unable to understand all of the gibberish (as he called it) of ""Spades For Winners"". ... Do not buy Mr. Steve's book, as you will be left in the dust....."
1,Not very good,I bought these from a large discount retailer. I have been using a double edge razor for many years now and I've yet to get a decent shave after more than a month of shaving using these blades. My recommendation is to try another brand.
1,Dog got sick from the product,"My dog (a 1.5 year old Golden) threw up several hours into chewing on this bone. She was fine the next day. However, our conclusion is that buying uncooked bones for dogs online or ""packaged"" is probably just asking for trouble."
3,You get what you pay for,"It doesn't look like a photo. It looks like a painting, not very clear. It will work in a bathroom though."
5,a great book to use!,"this book helped me so much. i took the diagnostic test in the beginning of kaplan about two weeks before sat2, and i was pretty depressed cause i got somewhere in the 500's. the book covered a lot of material i gotta admit, but it prepared you for any little question that could pop up on the real thing. i read the entire book, took all the quizzes and tests, read the section on getting ready for the sat2, and you should read the little icons on the sides of some pages cause they help you a lot. i got my score, and i got a 790 in the 98th percentile! i recommend using this book, and if you want, its a good idea to use the princeton also cause thats what i used along with kaplan."
4,Very good,"This book is perfect. It includes 101 really important mistakes, we IMGs do in the match process. It helped me a lot in the run for residency, but it cannot be used alone, since it includes clearly practical advice on clearly practical subjects. The positive in this book is that it can be read easily and fast, without tiring you at all. I think that alltogether with Iserson's guide it can be extremely useful."
1,Died as soon as I plugged it in,"I opened the box, plugged it in and sparks flew out of the back. That was it the microwave was dead. I never even got to use it once. I called sharp and they wanted to come out in five business days for a repair! Are you kidding me....it was never even used. Thanks Amazon for taking this piece of crap back. I ordered an LG with a 2 year labor/parts warranty with a 10 year magnatron warranty. I will never buy another Sharp product ever."
1,Throwing this out after 2.5 years,"This microwave worked well and I was pleased with it until last week. Sharp told me that only the magnetron and heating element are still under warranty and that I would be responsible for labor. The repair shop they referred me to said that it didn't sound like either of those parts were the problem, so I would be looking at parts and labor to fix a $150 microwave.I took the time to read reviews before I ordered this and still didn't get a product that lasted very long for the money. My last (and original) microwave lasted 20 years.My next microwave won't be a Sharp.I love Amazon, but now I am wishing that I'd bought this local and bought the 4 year service plan for $40 which is what ABT sells it for."
1,Microwave did not work,"I was excited to get the microwave and after the difficulty of lifting it to the nook in my kitchen and squeezing my hand behind it to plug it in, it DID NOT WORK. The start button and all the other buttons needed to cook did not operate. I am returning the microwave and do not want another one of these. I made the mistake of reading the positive feedback and did not read the ones about the microwave not working right out of the box!!!!"
3,Smart SciFi.,"Three and a half stars rating. Mr. Williams is a good story teller and his futuristic ideas are believable. The plot, and characters are well developed, and the writing is good. There wasn't this uphill, linear progression of interesting to more interesting though. However, there was a level degree of interesting throughout with a strong ending that, although smart, just seemed to be plucked from nowhere."
4,Helpful book,I have found this book to be a helpful reference book for my wedding clients. It probably is not the be all and end all of best ever books but it certainly does provide much helpful information.
1,Rather uninspired,"A rather uninspiring, boxed vision of arguably the best of romantic piano music. Everything is predetermined and calculated. If one finds 5 minutes of decent piano playing on this CD one should be happy. The lack of natural talent for music is obvious with this pianist. Particularly, that there are so many other phenomenal recordings of this repertoire, also from EMI catalog. One wonders why would EMI release something like that?! On the other hand, it seems that EMI took a step in the right direction: no new releases of this pianist are seen on the market. Looks like Ms. Rubinova's ""star"" is not there to ""shine"". The good news: one uninteresting pianist less! Rather, Martha Argerich or Murray Perahia, to name a few. This CD is NOT RECOMMENDED!"
5,Best allergy remedy I've ever used,I keep a bottle at the office and at home. Me and my family use it for our allergies year 'round. I used to use nasal spray and occasionally other medicines. I haven't used either since I have this. No side effects- can't beat it!Kevin
1,Flimsy and hard to use,"This drive is made out of cheap plastic. The drive comes with no written or CD documentation. The .pdf help file onboard is laughable and online help is no better.The file upload/download and encryption processes are anything but intuitive and difficult to understand. The maker seems to confuse the terms: drive, folder and file. I sent it back after one hour of trying to figure it out.Get the SanDisk Cruzer Titanium U3."
3,"Pretty, but a pain to put together - Risky Purchase!","I had been looking at this shelving unit for quite some time. The design is gorgeous and I love the colors. I finally ordered it from Amazon - it took about two weeks to get to me. There were about 20 wood pieces and a hundred screws and bolts. It took me over two hours to get the shelves together (you need two people) and another hour of extreme frustration to get one of the swinging doors on. The second swinging door was utterly hopeless to screw on straight and I am pretty good at putting stuff together. So, I now have this unit missing a door which is such a drag but it looks okay. Again, the design is very pretty. But the hassle to put it together and the lack of a second working swinging door makes this a RISKY PURCHASE. I'm not sure I'd buy it again in hindsight."
3,Straight Outta Hell,"This cd was fun to listen to, most of the songs were awesome. All together, it was a great cd, especially at parties!"
4,Wish I'd had this book when I was a kid!,"If you know a kid who's interested in racing, there's no better introduction to big-time motorsports than this book. It takes young readers (probably age 8 and up) inside the world of Champ Car racing, with thorough discussions of the drivers, cars, teams and events. When I was a kid, I had little concept of racing beyond the Indy 500, but a book like this would have added immensely to my understanding of the sport. The book's only shortcoming is that the information is somewhat dated now, but its young readers probably won't mind a bit."
4,"Rap music a form of literature, word and verbs and adjectives painted up like a picture...Cold 187'um","Classic, i know this term is overused when it comes to music, especially rap, but this 1 qualifies in my opinion....the only thing about the whole cd (or tape) as i originally owned in 1990...id the hip hoppy break beat (here we go, here we go) after the alarm clock before Livin Like Hustlers...if that the worst i can say, that means its official....187'um has sooo many great line, that i have to admit that i plan to sample and incorporate into songs of my own.... Loved it then, and listenin to it now takes me back to the early 90's.....here's a quote from me ""back in the day things really werent that good, but it seems good lookin' back""...not a reflection of this album, just the time when it came out."
3,not bad for a debut album,The debut album from ATL - an NWA legacy. Dr. Dre produced much of this album which was nothing compared to Cold187ums own effort in later ATL albums.
3,Same old thing... new questions,"Book is good for most average students. Clear text structure, ample iilustrations and comprehensive worked out examples. However, since I also own a copy of the 4th example, these was not much change to the basic text. Just new reworked questions and a few different examples. A good book for an average student and certainly a good buy. But if you have the 4th edition, maybe you wouldn't need a new one."
1,It is probably a joke,"The authors spend the first 8 chapters to warn readers about spurious correlation, ever-changing market cycle, propaganda and only to start to offer their own version of it in chapter 9 and after.It almost feels like Vic wrote the first part and Laurel wrote the second, or is it the other way around?"
1,An absolutely worthless book,Stop right now and banish all thoughts of spending any of your valuable time reading this book.A hodgepodge collection of useless scraps stuck together for the soul purpose of filling a book and getting your money!
1,Not Happy,I understand that there is no holy grail in trading and Mr.Niederhoffer makes that point very clear. I admire Niederhoffer courage against adversity lossing his millions. But after you read this book there is no surprise why Niederhoffer went broke. I want to see historic charts with Niederhoffer arguing his points not scatter diagrams that any one could draw.
1,condescending erudition as means of scoring points,"It is my impression that Niederhoffer believes he is back on the squash court scoring points against people like Graham for its own sake and not to explicate investment principles. His exegesis of laws of thermodynamics, the history of King Canute, and theories of probability distributions seem intended to show how smart he is and not to communicate anything useful. Ben Graham, like many brilliant people, has said some dumb things. Niederhoffer wrenches them out of context and neglects the fine results of Tweedy Browne and Buffett who use Grahamian metrics."
1,shipping cost,"I thought I'd save a trip to the store, this was in an order with a roofing nailer so I thought it would qualify for ""Super Saver Shipping"" and be free, but it is from Grizzly who must have a minimum shipping charge. The shipping was $6.45 on a $0.75 item making it 10 times the item price!"
4,Kurtis Blows the roof off,"I really enjoyed this mixed cd. I played and many of my friends wanted copies ( of course I didn't burn any). The artists were great, the lyrics understandable and the beats were hot.I would recommend this product and turn up the woofers!!ps. I gave my copy away and just bought a new one."
5,Excellent product,"I ADORE Bac-Out. My favorite use is on the carpet--it has removed several stubborn stains in our house that other carpet cleaning products left behind. Plus it doesn't leave the oily residue that other carpet cleaning products leave behind (and that inevitably cause additional staining since the oily residue is a dirt magnet). LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product."
5,Very good for the money...,"Lightweight and sturdy, very easy to assemble (took my 10 years old son about 10 minutes to put it together)."
3,"Functional, but assembly a bit of a pain","Product arrived slower than I wanted but faster than advertised. Assembly was a bit of a puzzler as the instructions were minimal and the pieces/parts are very similar. Sorted out a workable configuration by line of sight, but would have preferred a more obvious assembly guide. Finished product is both functional and sturdy - so no qualms about recommending it. All in all - decent product once assembled."
3,Sturdy but does not secure the keyboard,I like keyboard stand. I think it is a good deal but I am disappointed that it does not have some sort of clamp system at the end of each of the two top support bars. They are too wide to fit the grooves on the underside of the keyboard and there is no clamping system at each of their ends that would secure the keyboard in place. The stand and keyboard configuration is secure enough for normal use but the keyboard could slide off if pushed for some reason by a child or inconsiderate adult.
1,Not what is advertised,"The stand arrived this afternoon and the first thing I noticed is that it is NOT a Yamaha product as advertised and it does NOT fit my Yamaha keyboard as advertised.It is advertised as having height adjustments. Well, yes, I guess it does, but the height adjustment changes the width of the stand making it less useful.I can make it work, but I am not happy about having to jury rig it and am not happy about Amazon advertising a product as something that it clearly is not."
5,Easy Installation....If you're a handy typical person.....,"This item is actually easy to assemble. Took me only 3-5mins or even less to assemble. Now if you're not good at assembling materials, then it'll take 5-7 mins or even less. Real great product for keyboards."
1,Not a Yamaha. No hardware. Poor assembly directions. Not as pictured.,"Took a chance despite reviews because not everyone mentioned hardware was not included. Mine didn't, so now I have to bring the stand to the store and figure out which screws, what sizes, and how many. Look closely, it's not the stand as pictured on box. Nothing on box states it's Yamaha.It's $29.99 + extra expenses: knots & bolts, transportation, your free time. Also includes disappointment, frustration. Good luck."
4,Keyboard Stand,Good product for lightweight keyboard. Well made for that purpose. Best not to look at the instructions but just the picture on the box. Art
3,Inexpensive and functional,Assembly is a pain as many people have noted. It can be done from the single drawing of the assembled stand that is the entire assembly instructions. A little more user enlightenment from the manufacturer would be nice.Setting your keyboard on the stand is like setting a boiled egg on a plate. It will stay up but it slides around at the slightest provocation. A little less precarious mount would be nice.The stand is cheap and solid. It will work.
2,put your money elsewhere,"At first glance, this book looked exciting. However, once I started to (try to) read it, I found this book, itself, to be poorly designed. Emphasis seemed to be on slick, glossy pages rather than on content--unfortunate, because my initial appraisal had been, ""Great! Full color examples"". Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. There are better books out there. Over all, worth a glance but not a purchase unless you are just building a group library of information graphics books. I also agree with another reviewer who felt that some of the example designs were not very good."
5,A Jobim Lovers Dream! Herring makes you feel it!!!,"Jobim for Lovers is a Jobim Lover's dream. Vincent Herring makes playing the saxophone seem easy. His presentation is fluid and melifluous. Mr. Herring does Jobim impeccably well. You feel the music; you experience the sensuality that Jobim intended. All instruments are well executed. Along with Herring's saxophone, the accompanying instruments are united in such a way as to feel that all is one; all are cooperating to bring out he most in the Jobim pieces. Great listening for Jobim Lovers!!!"
3,"LOVE the story, but SO MANY TYPOS!","This was my all-time favorite childhood book, but there were so many typos throughout the text that I HAD to rate it low. The story is great but several times one of the supporting character's names was misspelled and there were other grammatical typos that are hard to overlook. It's important that our youth are reading quality work, and some of the typos would be distracting and make it difficult for a young reader to understand the story."
2,Predictable,Definitely not as good as Wait Til Helen Comes. Extremely predictable and anticlimactic. Also riddled with typos and errors which was very irritating.
3,Doll in the Garden,This is a wonderful story about friends and forgiveness. This book does have VERY bad spelling and punctuation. I would still recommend this book to young readers who enjoy mysteries.
5,The first ghost story to make me cry,This book was great from beginning to end it seemed to go by so fast I didn't want it to be over. I finished this book within 6 hours of buying it. Great book for people of all ages. The ending was just so touching I actually cried. Highly recommended!
5,Intreging!,"This book may start out slow but it is so esensial and intreging. I read this at 11 in 3 days becuase of the suspense. If you like scary books, you'll like this."
3,"Great Story, Horrible Typos","I borrowed the kindle version of this book from my local library. While the story was very interesting and lightly spooky, I couldn't help but get distracted by the numerous typos. It is very obvious that no human proofread this kindle book before releasing it. Among the many errors, ""eve"" was constantly used in place of ""eye"", ""rind"" instead of ""find"", and ""Krisd"" instead of ""Kristi"".The story itself is lovely. It has a nice lesson about losing loved ones and the guilt people feel over the things they should have said or done. There are spooky sections, but I didn't find them to be too intense. Readers young and old will enjoy this book.I do not, however, recommend the kindle version of this book. Instead, buy a hard copy. Surely, it has less typos."
4,Effective Training,"I bought a nice Cyclops trainer and was excited to stay in shape over winter. After 20 minutes I was so bored I quit my workout...until I got this video. The video breaks the workout into two main segments, so you don't feel like you are riding for an hour. I also like the intervals training, which are mountain biking specific.I am an amateur racer and I feel that this video can push me when I am in shape or just trying to hang on to my fitness over winter. I can't say this has me riding as much as I would outside, but without it my trainer would just be a paperweight.I can't compare to many other videos, but one video did come with the trainer and I would not speak as highly of it. I now keep the mountain biking DVD in at all times."
3,Versatile square candle holders,"This candle holder is indeed versatile - holding both votive/tea lights and tapers (although you may need to trim the bottom of your tapers to get them to fit the rather small hole). This candel holder is short, square with a wave contour, and completely silver in color. The photo is not completely accurate in its depiction of this item. These holders are fairly elegant with relatively easy care instructions. If you are looking for ""chrome-like"" candle holders - these are perfect."
3,Horrific gone sappy,"I love books about young women that overcome devastating obstacles, fight their oppressors, develop self-worth out of harrowing circumstances. So I was encouraged to read Tattoo Girl because it offered this precise mix. Throw in a little horror, a serial killer, wow. But I was disappointed by the writing (sophomoric), the characters (bland), and the plot (less than riveting). If you like this genre and don't mind being bored for some of the novel, give it a try. I hope they make the movie especially gruesome - that would help to lift the book out of its contrived doldrums."
1,Not reliable,"I am a paleoaracheologist, and far as I can tell, in many cases in regards to the noted period, the book is erroneously misleading. the kebaran paleolithic people, never lived in an arid, or semi arid situation up in the Levant. 13,000 BCE, the Levant was covered with almond woodland and extensive green steppe. archaeological remains will evidently support the idea. many claims in the 5th chapter are amazingly ""wrong"". they are not even debates over their falsehood. after reading 5-6 pages I put this book aside. from an academic point of view, this book runs into problem from the start. for accuracy, please verify information with other textbooks or experts."
2,The Very Long Summer,"Tepidly written, annoyingly repetitious, and carelessly edited, ""The Long Summer"" will disappoint those many readers who have enjoyed Brian Fagan's earlier works. There is very little new here, though the discussion of the rise of cities is quite interesting, and communication of the bitter cold during the Ice Age and how Cro-Magnons coped with it is fascinating. Most readers, though, will prefer David Keys's ""Catastrophe"" and Simon Winchester's ""Krakatoa."""
4,"Great story, local flavor","Living in Houston area, could relate to the locations ... story moves right along ... no dragging ... and a fine twist at the end!"
1,Little bit disappointed...,I'm sure this carry case is just fine for most chainsaw's but I was sorely disappointed to find out that it doesn't fit my husband's Husqvarna Rancher 455. Anyone looking for a carry case for a Rancher 455 should order part number 100000107.
1,A bit disappointed,I REALLY wanted this case! I bought it for a Husqvarva 455 Rancher as the product specification said it would accommodate -- the saw body was too big to close the case -- bar length was fine.
2,Not that great,"I play guitar and keyboards at a professional level. The MF-105 is noisy and its tempo input is temperamental. The stereo outputs do not work when the bypass is selected. But, the sounds can be quite inspiring."
4,Great Book for Professionals! (Only),"""Master Spades"" by Steve Fleishman takes the game of Spades to a higher level. The analysis is clear and sharp, and the Trump Management chapter is tremendous. If you have played Spades for a very long time, this Book is for you. - And your partner should also read Master Spades, as well, or you will be ""lost in the storm""!HOWEVER, ""Master Spades"" is virtually worthless for the beginner and intermediate player. Even if you buy the predecessor volume (""Spades For Winners""), you will be absolutely croaked with the abundance of ""technicalese"", and thye hundfreds of ""Bridge"" like hands! I suggest that you read one of the other ""general"" Spades Books out there - esp. ""How Not To Lose At Spades"". This is a great learning and teaching tool for the Novice/Intermediate player. THEN - you can move on to ""Master Spades"" (bypassing ""Spades For Winners"")....STILL, Steve has a great book ""Master Spades"" for the truly advanced player, and well worth your time and investment.."
2,Oh My God! Help me! I am drowning!,"God save us from the rambling wreck from Georgia Tech. Steve, who is a good player, just can't teach Spades. He is so wrapped up in his world of technical jargon, that he loses track of the beginner and newbie player.Steve's book might be OK for the expert - but I am not an expert. His Site, ""Master Spades"" has some nice tips for the newcomer to Spades -But - this book is just too much.PS For a great site for new players, check out the Beginner's area in Yahoo!"
4,Living Well With Menopause - A Gift For My Wife...,"My Wife really didn't know much about what she was going through from a medical stand point and was looking for some practical things she could do to help minimize her discomfort. She found this holistic approach to be an informative and real easy and enjoyable read. One she could relate to.For those guys out there wondering, yes I got away with giving my menopausal wife a book on menopause. It went over well simply because of the content and holistic approach of this book. That is pretty high praise for it!On another note, personally, I have read two other ""Living Well With"" series books and the publishers/writers have a high standard for getting helpful & useful information out there for those who suffer from the various conditions. Deffinately, well worth a look and some bucks to read if you're in one of the particular situations."
2,Presenting Johnny Mathis DVD from VHS,"I bought the DVD and was disappointed to find that the DVD is a copy from video tape and not of very good audio or video quality. My VHS copy is actually better than the source material used for this DVD.The DVD is of suspect origin and not issued by the BBC or another professional film production company. Having stated this, it's a nice addition to the collection of a Mathis fan because the video is very hard to find!"
5,Best in Class,"If you are looking for a USB drive, this one is best in class, period. It is virtually indestructible, small in size and fairly priced. It comes loaded with the U3 system, which allows me to run my key software (Firefox, Thunderbird, and Roboform) on any PC without worrying about leaving sensitive information behind. If you don't want to use U3 (some don't like it) it can be easily removed and this thing works just like any other USB drive. If you travel frequently, a U3 Cruzer is ideal."
2,Slick little tool but,"I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that I'm a Mac user and there is no way to get rid of the U3 System Launchpad for Windows that also loads upon insert. Unfortunately Amazon's website did not mention this U3 smart thing when I bought it. The price was right but it darn irritating to have the U3 System load up with the drive. Whose dimwitted idea was this? Other than that, it is sturdy and quick. No problems with the flash drive except for the aforementioned."
4,Does What It's Supposed To Do...Well.,"What else can I say...it's efficient, fast, and secure. The design means I don't have to worry about losing the cap. It works well for carrying programs and sinking data between computers and is big enough to hold all the data I need to back up and more..."
3,Accetable quality but less than expected,"The product I received looked like a used one with many minor scratches and the silver color has turn darker a bit. Quality seems to be fine but the appearance disappointed me a bit.I wish I had time to return it but since it was working fine, I decided not to return."
4,Fast but not cheap,Slightly expensive but in my opinion worth the price difference.The data transfer rate is significantly better than other flash drives I've used.
5,the best usb in the market,"I've had the 1 gb titanium for a year, never gave me a problem or anything,then i decided to buy the 2 gb u3 sandisk titanium and it was absolutely great, very high speed, even smaller than the old version which is better and this u3 variation is great, im telling you the best usb memory in the market, no doubt about it........"
2,"Good Hardware, annoying software","Good design, sturdy construction, 2GB are plenty of space for a thumb drive.But that U3 that installs itself and causes problems! It is more of a bug than useful software!If I had know it came ""equipped"" with that sofware I wouldn't have bought it!"
1,Don't buy if you're looking for ReadyBoost,"Note that Vista will report that this drive is too slow for ReadyBoost. The Cruzer that SanDisk says works with ReadyBoost has a ""BR"" on the end of the part number. The packaging was also very difficult to get into."
2,Not always reliable,"I purchased two of these. One works great, one doesn't. One wouldn't even connect for me to download to."
4,Synchronizes encrypted files quickly.,"The only reason I don't give the Cruzer Titanium 2gb five stars, is because it seems to have too many features! I only use it to store about 1gb of data, several thousand files now over 12 years, including all my Outlook emails, all my pdf, WORD, and WP data files, and about 1400 photos so far, but I wanted 2gb to be able to handle an increasing number of files over time. It takes awhile, maybe ten minutes or longer, to load that much data into the Cruzer. I use the encrypted function. However, once loaded, when I come back some weeks later, the Cruzer sychronizes very quickly with the files in my desktop, like maybe 15-30 seconds, deleting the ones I have deleted from my desktop and adding the files that I have added on my desktop. I have two of these Cruzers loaded with my desktop files, because I rotate them to always have a relatively updated one in my safe deposit box, in case of the unlikely event of fire in my home."
4,Sandisk 2 GB Cruzer,"The U3 system is sort of slow, but handy if you will be using many different computers. The head of the flash disk is retractable and sometimes hard to fit into the USB ports. Other than this, flash disk works fine."
1,MS Vista compatibility nightmare,"This may not be all of SanDisk's fault, but I could not get the Cruzer to work properly with MS Vista operating system. The problem was that when I closed out of an MS Office application and then went to close the Cruzer, assigned the F-Drive on your system, I kept getting messages that MS Office was not responsing and I needed to restart the computer. I spent 45 minutes on tech support with SanDisk and ultimetly ended up returning it. Based on the reviews written it sounds like a great product, and probably is!! I just can't seem to get it to work with MS Vista O/S."
5,SanDisk 2 GB Cruzer Titanium,Everything as excellent as I expected. I recommend it with my eyes closed!
1,Poor quality,"As other noted* comfortable fit/acceptable look* poor quality* length longer then advertised (have 30, but usually get 32)Bought two pairs last year around same time (looked up the receipt)..These were worn occasionally on weekends (I work from home).. a pair didn't last a year.. and I've had similar experience with earlier purchases.. will look at other brands."
3,Same problem with every pair,"I absolutely love these jeans, except for one particular problem with every pair I purchase.First off, they are SO FREAKING COMFORTABLE and fit great. I love the pockets and the colors. They are stylish and go good with ""dressier"" clothes to go out on the town with.My problem is the splitting at the back pocket in the middle of the jean. After 6-8 months they are ripping and forcing me to buy more. And yes, I keep buying the stupid things because I love them. They would easily get 5 stars from me if this issue was corrected. PLEASE LEVI'S, fix this issue!!"
1,Can I give it a zero?,This high chair is the biggest piece of junk. I bought this for my daughters birthday in October and it's already been put in the trash. The heart that goes on the back of the chair would not stay on from day 1. A month after I bought it the plastic piece where the leg goes into the chair broke so it became useless. And it would not fit any doll beside the cheap small ones. Don't waste your money on this!
1,Unbelievable! CD Miscategorized. This is NOT Smooth Jazz.,Why didn't I check the reviews? Why didn't I sample the CD before buying it???? Because I was counting on Steve Cole to deliver the Smooth Jazz and the Funk! What happened here? This is definitely Steve Cole less everything that's needed in this compilation. Maybe Steve Cole never played on this CD....BUYER BEWARE.
5,A Grateful New Fan,"I've been a smooth jazz fan for 20+ years: Rippingtons, Spyro Gyra, Both Daves (Sanborn & Koz) Jeff Kashiwa, Paul Taylor et.al, but somehow I'd overlooked Steve Cole. Well, I'm glad I've found him, and I thought ""Spin"" was a great, multi-hued introduction. Ultimately, musical taste is one of the most subjective areas there is, next to comedy and sex appeal, but if you sample the cuts on Amazon and think you might like the CD, I guarantee you'll end up really liking it even more than you anticipate."
1,Very dissapointing,"What was Steve Cole thinking of? This CD is dreadful. This is not Smooth Jazz. It's a mixture of country & western sytle folk sounding guitar with bluesy arrangements. Sure, steve plays his sax well, but hardly any essense of smooth jazz to be found. The only track i liked was ""Serenity"" This has all the quality trademarks of Steve Cole of old but one track does not make an album. If you are a Steve Cole fan DO NOT BUY BLIND LIKE I DID!! Listen first. I read somewhere that steve cole described this album as his best work. May i suggest Steve that you consider being a folk/country and western music performer if you're going to insult your fans with this dribble. There are one or two good moments on this CD but overall it's a waste of money and yet another dissapointing release for 2005."
1,Appalling,"After reading through Reclaim the Power of the Witch all I can say is ""I am appalled"" that Samuel Weiser allowed this to come off their press. The publisher has done better in the past. This was definately not their best. Mr. Plaisance should try to write fiction. It fits right in with his ""stories"" of trial and error experiences. It may impress newbes to the craft but that would be all. My true rating is O."
5,I'll give this another 5 pentagrams,"I liked ""reclaim"" so much I'll leave another 5 pentagrams in the lot ! Read it folks. If you ""claim to be a witch"", you should have no problems with this book.Swamp Witch of the SouthBelinda"
1,Not impressed,"With all the current books on the market about Wicca, Reclaim the Power is just what we need, another rehash of old material, nothing new, nothing impressive. I rate this book a ""O"" as I disliked having to give one star."
1,Disappointed,I received a copy of Reclaim the Power of the Witch as a birthday gift. After reading the first chapter I felt sorry for the people who wasted their money buying it. The eight ways of magic have already been published. If the book was not given to me as a gift I would have thrown it in the garbage. Acutally I rate this book a BIG O.
4,I'm feeling this joint....,i like deadringer even more but some of the breakdowns on this album are great...definitely check it out.
5,An album to treasure.,"I first heard ""You Win Again"" performed on ""Austin City Limits"" in 1993, and I was instantly hooked on MC-2's gift for music. Her work on this album, along with phenomenal guitarist John Jennings, represents some of the finest ""Pure Americana"" music available."
3,An unrepentant Stalinist to the very end,"Read Robeson's embarassing tributes to his ""beloved comrade"" Stalin. ""The great Stalin... [who,] through his deep humanity, by his wise understanding... leaves us a rich and monumental heritage..."" This was written for Stalin's funeral, long after it was known that he slaughtered tens of millions of people (and enslaved untold millions more in massive and deadly construction projects). And there are many such more examples. If Robeson had gone to the USSR and stayed, he would've been executed just like all the other fellow travelling goofs who stayed over there. Instead, he came back to help whitewash our understanding of one of history's most notorious mass murderers. Stalin even managed to outdo Hitler... but not Chairman Mao."
1,If you want to learn how to make documentaries don't waste your time with this one,"The description of this VHS led me to believe I would learn something about how to make a documentary. Instead, it is Mr. Hoffman talking about his personal experience with the making of each documentary and clips. The stuff is outdated and you learn nothing on documentary making techniques. Do not waste your money on this one. I feel cheated in a big way."
4,Numi Tea is very good,I have been buying this tea from grocery store and it was much better at Amazon because of the selection.
3,great but...,"ok... the earrings are lovely and i am very happy with the price i paid for them, but in my opinion the pic. is a bit deceaving. although the pic. shows you great detail of the earrings it does not show you how small they really are. I was aware that because of listed price, they were going to be small but they are smaller than i expected way, way, way... smaller than i ever imagined. i think jewelry vendors should be required to include a 'actual' size pic. with their adds."
5,Numi Green Rooibos,"I don't usually like green tea, because of the grassy taste, but this is pretty good.The grassy taste is very light. It taste more like real tea than rooibos usually does.Matter of fact, I have to remind myself it isn't ""real tea"". It has a very slight peppery aftertaste. For something that taste like tea, and isn't tea, and isn't bitter like tea can be, this is a really good alternative."
2,"Disappointing, unspirited presentations","This set of two CDs is certainly full of hymns, many of which I had not previously heard. But the singing lacks ""brio"" and has a ""one size fits all"" feel about it. One rendition seems to blend into the next, with little noticeable difference, despite the varying emphases of the individual hymns. I enjoyed a number of performances, but on the whole, found this a rather boring collection."
5,Yummy for adults and picky kids. Not too sweet and a good snack on the go.,Great price on sale. Kids love them as much as I do. Not too sweet and heavy. Great for soccer games and the morning rush.
5,Fast food at the best level,"I have gone through a couple dozen boxes of these cereal bars, using them on weekend mornings when I have to get up early and run, with no time for preparing a breakfast or grabbing vitamins. These serve me as instant food at work when I simply have no time to get away for a meal. I have got use to their dryness and the peculiar strip of sugar meandering across the top. Someone suggested the sweet strip activates saliva. Ok, an excellent idea, since I don't have time to grab water either. I recommend these bars for people on the go, definitely."
1,very disapponted,"All the yada-yada on the box made the bar sound very appetizing and good for you. Yuck, much too sweet, they used that cheap brown rice syrup to make it sweet, the texture is disgusting (feels like apple cores and chinese newspapers..haha from the Simpsons)- chewy and dry yuck- I dont taste fresh blue berries at all. Save your money and opt for LaraBar! I dont even now what to do with the 11 other bars just sitting in my counter."
3,The Flag is Quality,The flag itself is good quailty. I purchased it to collect the original design on the Georgia flag. I collect flags and want to have all the various versions of state flags in my collection. even ones that are offensive or wrong.
3,disappointing,"I sense that I may be ruffling some feathers here, but this really is one of Toad's poorer efforts. Torn and She Cried are the only great songs on this record. Chile, Come Back Down, High on a Riverbed, Jam, and Corporal Brown are all at least okay, but the effect of all of them together is rather boring, and the other four are pretty much filler. Any of their other albums (except In Light Syrup), would be far better stewardship of your money."
1,The Thin Red Line does not deliver,"Beware that this CD does not include many of the fantastic tracks in the original movie. It is just the incidental compositions of the principal composer, not all of the compositions by other composers that were added into the movie soundtrack. Disappointed."
5,Haunting and Beautiful!!!,"No doubt one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores to date!!! The simple, yet breathtaking music is enough to reduce one to tears. Definetly the finishing touch on one of the greatest war stories ever brought to the cinema. Try ""Light""."
2,Borya and the Burps is More for Adults then Children,"Borya and the Burps An Eastern European Adoption Story by Joan McNamara looks and feels like a children's book but once you start to read it clearly is for adults or for older children about to add a sibling to their family via adoption. This story explains what it is like in an orphanage in some far off European country, who takes care of the babies and what the routine might be like. The book focuses on a baby boy named Borya and what his routine is day in and day out and how he feels when one of the 7 babies in his room adopted, and finally how he feels when he is chosen by an American family. This information maybe very helpful to parents who want to acclimate their newly adopted child into their home.Having said that, Borya is often confused in this story and has his own special concerns and worries. All very well and good for parents to read and learn about but not necessarily child friendly."
3,Political Fantasy,"This book does break away from the standard ""adventure"" fantasy novel that shows a character change while faced with a journey or difficulty. In this novel, no character struggles to their position, for every pertinent individual has power at the beginning. From that point on, the book follows the political plotting of good versus evil. If you love the details of running a government and the nuances of delegating power, give it a try. I find it works really well to lull me off to sleep at night."
3,"Slow start, but great ending","Bottom Line: Try before you buyThis is a good book...regardless of it having a slow somewhat mediocre beginning (with the boy father dying and how that was portrayed). A good adventure book, following a young somewhat reluctant hero character as he attempts to make his own way (or feel his way along), as the new leader.It did pick up quite a bit, after the father died..and the introduction of his chosen (or picked for him) bride.. There were lots of characters to keep your attention and help move the action along. The bad guy was great, as was his stable of unwed conniving and plotting daughters. Not much erotic in this book.It skipped a little, or fast forward in time, and left you wondering what had happened since there was just a sort of short summary.Overall though, it kept my attention, and definitely had me wanting to read the next in the series. I'd give a 3.5."
5,Wonderful!,"The characters are realistic- you love some, hate others, and share their emotions. You can actually cry at some points."
1,"If my man slept with someone else, He would be GONE!!!","I was really enjoying this book until the husband fathered a child with someone else and then the wife just accepted it and kept going on and on and on about how this was ""their child"". BLECHH. NO woman would put up with that kind of behavior from their spouse!!! I really enjoyed some of Melanie Rawn's other works, but this one incident from her female hero just made me mad, I will not even finish the book now and do not plan on finishing the series. There are better books with stronger female protagonists!!"
2,The Dragon Prince,"I only made it 300 pages through teh first book. But what no one is writting is that this is more of a love story then anything else. And I wasnt too fond of the way she jumps around all the time. The charectures are well enough developed but it was just too ""he touched me and my skin turned to fire.."" lame! times that by 50 and you have the 1st half of the first book."
5,One of my favorite series of all time,I love these books. I'm glad they're finally available for Kindle. Now if they would just add the Dragon Star Trilogy...
3,Smart Splash - Letter Link Crabs,"This is potentially a wonderful educational toy. My one complaint (and the disappointment of my grandson) is that it has only one alphabet letter/vowel per package. For example, you cannot spell ""mommy"" or ""daddy"". Most alphabet educational toys have several common letters and vowels per set."
2,not recommended,not recommended this one not really cool the smell like for old taste not for the young I chose the wrong one.
5,"Great product, Great value.","Received PocketWizard right on time, as promised. Product is great - worth the investment high-quality remote flash trigger. I would definitely recommend getting the package deal with the case for 2 PocketWizards. Case is great to store them and throw in your camera bag.One note of learning - be sure to also purchase the right type of sync cord to connect the PocketWizard to the flash! I didn't and assumed the cord came with the remotes. Not true - my error. So get the right cord to fit your flash"
4,Wayyyyy better than radio poppers.,"I have a pretty simple setup of 2 lights when i shoot in an area that's about 70 yards long. I had used radio poppers but one of them would misfire about 60% of the time creating too many inconsistencies in my shots. It sucks when you miss a shot because it's under exposed beyond repair due to a misfire. Since i've had the PW's, i've had NO misfires. These things trigger reliably and regularly. Highly recommended for simple setups."
1,Watch Out!,"I received my Pocket Wizard Plus II's as a gift. I need to connect them to Phonogenic StudioMax strobes. This requires a sync cord to connect the Pocket Wizard to the stobe. Of course, the cable that comes with the Pocket Wizard is not the right size. Go to the Pocket Wizard web site to see what kind of cable I need. It says miniphone to 1/4"". If I knew anything about sync cables, I'd have known that was wrong, but I trusted them. Ordered one. Wrong cable. The correct cable is miniphone to miniphone. Amazon says it ""usually ships in 1 to 3 months"". MONTHS! B&H is out of stock. Pocket Wizards sit in a box. A little annoyed at David Hobby right now."
5,Drawing made easy,My son loves airplanes and my son loves to draw. He uses this to draw some new and different aircraft with the same/similar shapes that are included in the book.
4,very pleased,"I'm very happy with this product. It makes a very nice all-in-one makeup container. I like that the mirror is larger than most compacts - that way I use to put in my contacts, too. I also like that the brush is a full buki brush, but still fits inside case. There are only two downfalls to this product: 1. it is a little large, so if you carry a small purse, it won't work and 2. when I close the powder lid, there is always a little powder that excapes.Overall, i am thrilled with this product. It is also very sturdy, so if you have children who like to go through your purse - it hasn't broken yet from a fall."
5,Better than Harry Potter!,This book was great! I couldn't put it down! It constantly keeps you thinking as the characters continue their quest. It is like a mixture of Harry Potter and an anime fused togather. It's just soooo cool! I love it!
5,"A Wonderful, Wonderful story!!!","This is my favorite Iris Johansen storyline so far! I love the pyschological complexity of Eve and was strangely satisfied with the romantic triangle between Eve, Logan, and Joe at the end! By drawing out the resolution of Eve's well being Ms. Johansen has crated a classic character that will last longer than one installment! Great work!"
3,Where is the Romance in this Romantic suspense?,Not as good as her others. With each book she seems to focus more on her plots. I kept wondering when Ms. Johansen was going to get the romance going & suddenly it was the end of the book.
2,"Well, I didn't put it down in disgust...","Maybe that's because it was given to me for free while I was in the hospital... by someone who was happy to give it away. For that matter, as soon as I got out of the hospital I passed it on to a friend who was in a car accident and can't walk. There was no suspense of disbelieve. I have more faith in the existence of santa claus than I do in the circumstances surrounding the pseudo-characters found in this novel."
5,A Good Read!,Enjoyed all of Iris' suspense novels. This one is as good as the others. Can't wait for the sequel. I kind of figured out that there would be a sequel about half way through the book.
1,Extremely disappointing read,"Johansen's strength seems to be dialogue, but since this novel lacks descriptive narrative and decent characterization, not even dialogue could save THE FACE OF DECEPTION. Eve Duncan, the forensic sculptor obsessed with bringing ""the lost ones"" (including her own daughter) home, should have been an enormously sympathetic character. Instead, her prickliness and wariness wore thin in a hurry. I never felt any sort of real connection between Eve and her men, Logan and Joe. I barely felt a connection between Eve and her mother. In short, Johansen couldn't make me care for any of the so-called protagonists. As a result, I won't be reading anymore Eve Duncan novels or anymore Johansen for that matter. If you want to read excellent serializations with strong female protagonists, I recommend J.D. Robb's In Death series, Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, or Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series."
3,A Decent Mystery,"Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan is hired by an industrial mogul to reconstruct a face to a skull which has been kept hidden in a cornfield. Who the face belonged to, why the skull was hidden and why the mogul wants it reconstructed are the mysteries to be unveiled. That part of the novel will hold the readers interest to the end. I thought that part of the book was good.The characters, however, I felt were shallow and had little depth. I didn't find myself getting really interested in any of them. Eve Duncan, while being gifted at her work, came across as emotionally mercurial and indecisive. The male characters left little lasting impressions.I also thought that parts of the storyline dragged a little. For me, the 336 pages felt like it read longer. Overall, though, ""The Face of Deception"" is a decent read. I liked it enough to likely read more of the Eve Duncan series to see if the characters develop a little better."
1,Far-fetched,"I was so disappointed in this book. Johansen is a favorite author, but she went off the deep end with this one. The characters were not likeable, the plot was far-fetched, the pacing was slow and overdramatic. In short, a big ""thumbs down"" on this one. She needs to go back to her roots to discover her writing again. Please, do not make this one into a sequel!!"
3,Not in love,"I have to agree with some other reviews cosidering eves character.She's just not very likeable.she's whiney,rude,and too self centered.I did like the story though.It has a good twist;but i need Eve's character to not be so stand offish. i'm willing to read the next book in the series to see if she can have a turnaround and get me more interested in the character along with the plot"
3,I didn't like Eve.,"Although this book moves very fast, I found the main character, Eve Duncan, to be abrasive, aggressive, and downright rude. I used to really enjoy Iris Johansen's books, but lately her characters are not even likeable. No more of her books for me, even though I like her writing style. It's her characters that leave me cold."
5,Fantabulous!,"Since I first got a vinyl record of Mickey Finn quite a while back,this CD brings back the fabulous virtuousity of Mickey and Cathy.I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves to hear the plectrumbanjo."
5,Just what I wanted,"Bought this for my car where I need a good noisy, driving CD to keep me alert when driving.It has plenty of drive but also some lovely moments. Bought MUNICH and War of the Worlds to accomplish the same purpose but KING KONG is MUCH the best of the 3. A really GOOD ONE."
4,Another great score James!!!,"I have been an avid listener of scores since I was young. I usually have a place in my heart for the likes of Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer, but James Newton Howard has been a definite new favorite when it comes to his composition style!With King Kong, he again composed an amazing score that fit the story so well. For me, the music is what propels a movie and helps change the mood and feeling from scene to scene. This soundtrack did just that.The only reason I gave if 4 stars out of the 5 is that I was listening to the theme and it sounded too much like the progression that Alan Silvestri(another great composer) used in Van Helsing. Don't know if anyone else agrees?But this is definitely worth the buy none-the-less. Not to mention seeing this movie is an awesome theatrical experience...this movie is one you HAVE to see in the theatres...WOW! =+)"
3,good enough job site boom box,"good enough features i wish i could have more powerfulll speakers, other that that is ok, what i like more is that i can conect my mp3 with my own music selection."
3,Kills Batteries,This thing is great BUT .. DONT use it to charge batteries! If you leave it on and unplugged it will completly drain your battery. Not only that even when it is plugged in it still ruins your batteries! I am down to 1 of 5 batteries now because the charger on it Overcharges the batteries and ruins them. The tools are great but the batteries and chargers are junk. Im thinking of investing in some lithium batteries and chargers. I suggest doing the same.
3,WOULDN'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON AGAIN,"I ENJOYED THE PRODUCT BUT IT JUST QUIT WORKING AFTER 1 WEEK FOR NO REASON. BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON THERE IS NOTHING I CAN ABOUT IT...IT IS CONSIDERED ""ELECTRONICS"" AND THEY HAVE A VERY CRAPPY RETURN POLICY. I WOULD ONLY BUY THE PRODUCT FROM SOMEWHERE I COULD RETURN IT BECAUSE I HAVE LOST ABOUT $150."
1,Died in a few months,"I had the 1st version dewalt radio and it lasted for 6 years in countless rains and airport travels ( not to mention dropping it off of roofs) before it finally died on me. So, thinking the newer one would be better I bought it but it shorted out when I had it plugged into the wall socked about 3 months ago and now it won't charge batteries and its useless. Granted I live in Hawaii where its always wet but 6 months? c'mon the old ones were hardcore."
3,"Great charger, good radio.","Charges 18v batteries in no time.... Radio reception not so great. No memory without small batteries installed, ( which don't last long at all.)Tuning knob is slow and cumbersome. Should be called a worksite charger with radio add-on."
1,"Dead after 10 months, repaired dead again after 1 year...","Purchased this microwave based on reviews at the time and the fact it matched our other appliances. Unit had all the bells and whistles and worked great for about 10 months when an electrical component went bad sending smoke AND sparks out from under it. I had the unit repaired and was told a new updated piece was used. Now, a year later the unit will work about half the time. It will work fine when used once, but if you put in something else immediately following it will shut itself off (overheating?). Anyway, that's the end of it. I refuse to pay to have this thing repaired again. Buy at your own risk..."
2,Product is not what is pictured,"The product was not what I expected upon receipt. The jars were not as pictured. I ordered two dozen of these jars with fruit on top and recieved two dozen jars with silver lids. I could have chosen may other places to purchase plain jars. The jars themselves work great for what I need, but I definitely lost the decoration I had been expecting."
3,smaller than it looks,"I wanted to use these as fancy drinking cups but they are too small. hard to get an idea of how big they are in the picture. They are smaller than a soda can. Im using them as pen holders, OJ glasses. Wish they had some bigger quilted ones that I can use as regular glasses for beer, soda, etc."
1,"""NOWS..."" ARE A GREAT WAY TO HEAR DIFFERENT ARTIST","I have beening buying ""Nows"" for a long time and they always have songs either just out or never released in the US. Hey 40 songs for $40 it's always a great bargain. Much better than the new US versions. It's a must for my collection hands down no doubt about it."
2,David Sedaris Picked These?,"I'm a huge fan of several writers in this collection, but they are NOTHING like David Sedaris. This book left me feeling sex crimed - which is what happens within its pages during one of the worst stories ever put on paper. And though I love Lorrie Moore, I didn't care for her tale about the baby pooping blood. Like the rape tale, it felt too sensational without a very strong point.Love Sedaris, but after this I would never take reading recommendations from him."
3,entertaining,short easy read. entertaining but predictable. borrow it dont buy. not one i will keep on my shelf or in my kindle.
1,TERRIBLE RECORDING. DO NOT BUY IT.,"I had high expectations of this HD-DVD that claims ""Music Experience In 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" and was very disappointed.Cons:1. The recording has a lot of low frequency (bass)distortion, most noticeable on the first song.2. The music is not performed by an orchestra and not even by a group, it is mostly just a keyboard.3. The musicians are not identified, maybe because it is just one.Pro:A. The selection of songs is very good.B. The Pictures of NY, Paris, etc. are beautiful.In conclusion, I would not recommend this HD-DVD and wish Amazon would take it back."
3,Good Performance. Sound is questionable,This recording is one rare that uses the Mandarin's new edition . This new edition ( for Universal Edition) restores some cuts in the final part of the Ballet. The son of Bartok made the research for this new ( and more complete) edition .Only the recordings of Robertson ( Harmonia Mundi) and this one uses this complete version.I admire Mrs Alsop . She is really a first rate conductor and the orchestra plays very well this complicate score. My favorite Mandarin is the one conducted by Ivan Fischer. Sometimes I feel in Alsop some lack of violence .Ps: the sound of the recording is very confused .
4,Well Illustrated Non-Critical History of Zagato,"Nicely illustrated history of Zagato. More info could have been provided on Ugo's family and personal life, but the book does track the various locations of the factory around Milano. As is common, the book is basically an ad for a company, in this case Zagato. First published in 1984, in English and Italian."
4,Another Good Product from Mika Aire,"Upon purchasing this fan, I now own 4 Minka Aire fans. The build quality on this one is bit lower than the others in that there are minor imperfections in the frosting of the white globe. These are not noticeable enough to endure the hassle of parts replacement but still annoying. I was able to hang the fan without difficulty. The blades are perfectly balanced and the motor runs much quieter than that of the Hampton Bay fan it replaced. Price on Amazon was very good and I am happy with my purchase. Although my other Minka Aire fans are Airus models, they are now 6 years old and still run flawlessly."
5,I use it everyday,"I chose this laptop desk because of all the great reviews. ALWAYS read reviews and go from there. I put this on my wishlist and recieved it as a Christmas gift. I absolutely love it. It's so comfortable and easily fits my huge laptop. I had to remove the cupholder for my computer to fit, but it is easily replaced for when i'm using it for eating in bed. :)Great buy."
4,One Humble Bumble!,"Playing Mantis continues delivering top quality figures from Rankin and Bass's ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer."" This figure shows the mighty who has fallen, as Yukon Cornelius brings home the now-toothless Abominable Snowman.As with other figures in this series, Playing Mantis has perfectly captured the Animagic puppets, and Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble look as good in your house as they do on the TV. Along with looking good, they make for great actual toys as well, with fun, removable accessories and such.The only drawback to these particular figures is, to those who have bought the previous releases, the figures are 95% duplicate. The Abominable Snowman is the same as the original figure, minus the teeth, and Yukon Cornelius is the same with the addition of a back-pack."
2,One big dissapointment,"This was the first Diane Carey book I'd ever read and I was shocked.The book got absolutely nowhere, the characters were boringly portrayed and, at times, seemed to act very much out of character.The novel is filled with over-simplification, clichés and stereotypes, while it gives us the usual Klingon-animal Human-God type of message.About 85% of the book is made up by completely irrelevant and poorly paced scenes that don't contain any entertainment or artistic deapht.But it DID portray an interesting time on the TNG timeline and is maybe worth one read if you have time and can find it from a public library. But don't by it. Thats all I have to say about this one."
2,way too much ship nostalgia,"The dedication to old navy ships was way too hokey. She did a good job of trying in familiar scenes from movies and episodes, however. I think she used her thesaurus too much in this book. I know this sounds uncomplicated, but I really would have preferred to have a villain in this book."
2,too annoying to get more than 2 stars,"Well , basically it's an interesting story and concept , with a really bad attitude .1 - If you like the sea , coast-guard , ships , sailing , even fishing , etc .. then this might be the book for you . On the other hand if you don't , very recomended you skip this one (and any other ones by D.Carry) so her ship sank , too bad .. doesn't mean she has to torture us about it in the book !2 - Cpn Bateson and his crew sound more like drunken mad pirates , than decent federation explorers ( or even border guards )Now the good things .1 - The general story is interesting enough to keep you reading .2 - the kilngons are very well done and 'alive' . ( I actually felt sad for Zaidan )I think I've read other books by D.carry . ( I don't remember ) I might have even enjoyed them . But this one is just VERY annoying in it's 'special' kinda way ."
1,"Could Have Been Worse, But Should Have Been Far Better","Unfortunately, the rest of Diane Carey's works are unfamilliar to me. This one, however, is rather bad. The story is not very consistent with ""The Next Generation"" TV show, and is not well written even by ""Star Trek"" novel standards. The ending is easily the worst part of the book, leaving the reader wondering why the book was written at all. Of all the Star Trek books I've ever read, I've found this one to be the least enjoyable."
1,junk,I thought Sharper Image products were supposed to be higher quality. Boy was I wrong. This wasn't designed any better then cheaper ones. One side never worked at all!!
4,A Lot of Advice,My first attempts to read this book were frustrating! I couldn't process all the information. Then a friend at our homeschooling co-op told about her successes with the classical model and she gave me tips on how to read this book. That made all the difference for me. The information went from overwhelming to manageable and inspirational. We're following their suggestions this year and have enjoyed the switch.One word of warning: we are newly into the classical approach and we do struggle. Our old curriculum was dry but easily structured. We're on our 4th week and still struggling to get each day's tasks finished. Hmm...maybe the book has something to say about that?!?!
1,Guide to Flowering Plant Families by Wendy B. Zomlefer [Paperback],*****This should be a five star rating but something happened when I wrote the review so I can't change the star rating. Suffice it to say that this is a very comprehensive book with wonderful black and white illustrations. A very useful guide for students of botanical art or for anyone interested in plants.
3,No More Kings,"If you like poorly drawn cartoons with not-so-great singing about history, then you will love this one. No More Kings sums up the pilgrims landing on America, the taxation without representation, and the colonist's reaction to it. It doesn't mention many acts, but it gets the main point across. If you watch the video prior to reading about it in a text book, you would have a better understanding of what it's all about. This video should be viewed by little kids because it wouldn't give much information to an older viewer. I gave it a 3 because it left out more than half of the acts, most of which were major ones, and didn't go very in-depth with the ones it did mention. If I could improve this video, I would get better singers, add more detail, and include all the acts."
5,Schoolhouse Rock - The Shot Heard Round the World,"It was one of the most significant events in American History when the Americans revolutionized against the British. The schoolhouse Rock version of this event, entitled ""No More Kings"", is very entertaining and educational for children between the ages of seven through ten, It was appropriate and fun for the following reasons. Firstly, creators simplified the events, therefore making it easier for children to comprehend. Secondly, it is illustrated with humorous cartoons, so that it is fun to watch and listen to. In addition, it is simply educational and will give kids a jump start on American History. Lastly, since the song is shown on television, the events in history, such as the Boston Tea Party, are drawn out. Visuals always help young children remember things. As parents and teachers can tell, ""No More Kings"" is a great way to get children and students to learn our country's history while having fun."
5,I love it,In my history class we listened to this everyday so we could learn the preamble. It was the best part of my day. The songs can be kinda stupid but its still awesome
5,My Favorite Series,"I live in Michigan and have travelled the whole State. So when Heywood mentions the small towns and cities, I can immediately conjure up a picture in my mind. I have also explored many of the back roads and two-tracks in the U.P., His power of description is dead on! I connect immediately.Even if you took that all away, I still believe the plot lines he develops in the Woods Cop series are every bit as good as any nationally recognized author. For years, I was a Clive Cussler fan, eagerly awaiting each new release in the Dirk Pitt series. Dirk got old and boring. Granted, Grady already is old :) and his adventures never get boring! I have also read some of the other ""popular"" Michigan mystery writers. Personally, I think Mr. Heywood's style is far more mature and refined.I could confidently attach this review to any one of the books in the series. They are all superb. Thank you Mr. Heywood!"
5,Understated,I had read a review of this album a while ago and decided to take a chance. Very introspective and revealing. Worth purchasing if only for the title song but the entire recording is memorable.
2,Snarky Comments Against Older Mothers,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, I was really disappointed and disturbed by the bias that the authors have against older mothers. At times you hear a running theme about how older parents ""will be feel out of the loop at school activities and functions"" and how a radiologist friend snarked how these older moms are getting mammograms with young children in tow. Just who do they think egg donor recipients are? Are only younger women in their 30's the only ones who deserve to get egg donation. I thought they would be more objective."
2,"good info, bad editing","This book contains some useful information but is so full of typographical and grammatical errors that I could not finish it. In some portions, there is at least one typographical, spelling, or grammatical error on every page; sometimes there are multiple errors on a single page. I find it difficult to believe that the publisher allowed it to go to print in this form. That said, the book did stimulate my thinking on various issues related to the decision whether to undergo IVF with egg donation. If you can get past the bad editing, then it is worth perusing."
3,Informative - But be prepared if you are over 40,"I liked this book and I didn't like this book if that's possible. After seeing all the 5 star ratings for this book I was excited to read it. Finally a book on egg donation. And while I found it to be informative and helpful I couldn't help but feel as if the authors views were not supportive to those of us who were embarking upon the journey of egg donation and that wanting to have a baby over the age of 40 was selfish and unfair to the child. I will tell you I am a much better and present parent than I would have been in my 20's and even early 30's. I have much more patience now than I did many years ago. I think it's fair to say that parenting at any age is challenging, and I think women over 40 should be encouraged and supported if they wish to have a child through egg donation."
2,Russian Pearls,"This is one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. Granted, it's Russian, which makes the pearl diving a bit of a mystery. I was never sure where it was supposed to be. I'm still not sure. But maybe that a good thing."
4,His most personal album!!,"After much commercial success, Loggins developed this truly personal effort. One that unfortunately was not a blockbuster like the last few albums. ""Sweet Reunion"" was a smooth arrangement of vocals with the help of Take 6. The title track was a smooth ride. But it's the track, ""I Would Do Anything"" that I give high praise for it's nice duet. Recommended!!"
5,Could this be the future of professional sports?,"Great read. This is one on thoes books you just can't put down. Filled with suspense and a sinking feeling that this book could be a realistic step in the future of sports. Do any of us know the depth of DNA? Could this be an insite into a new sports world of the future. This book makes you stop and think very seriously about the pharmaceutical industry and what the possibility could be in this direction. Especially where $$$$$ is concerned. As for Sam Dole, and the poor athlete's that were injected with the meds only makes you hope for a sequil to Tight Genes. To me, this book is only the begining of a much bigger adventure.M. SparksMenifee, California"
4,Great songs,"Totally No. 1s is definitely one of the better collections of 1970s hits and contains some really timeless songs. In style, it encompasses everything from rock and pop to dance and folk music. My favorites include the catchy pop number Sunday Girl and the stylish dance classic Heart Of Glass by Blondie, the engaging Make Me Smile by the underrated UK band Steve Harley and Cockney rebel, the poignant Vincent by Don McLean and the imaginative Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush. The Wizzard and Dave Edmunds tracks are good examples of tuneful 1970s rock whilst Tiger Feet by Mud and In The Summertime by Mungo Jerry are catchy bubblegum pop. So You Win Again by Hot Chocolate is a soulful pop ballad and the Suzi Quattro songs are hard rocking proto punk. Other classics include Kung Fu Fighting, You To Me Are Everything and Rock Your Baby. This is a great collection of melodic songs in many styles but certainly not a comprehensive window on the 1970s as it lacks any of the great disco number ones."
5,The Bangles,"The bangles were the Girl Group of the 1980s, they had style, fame, and the musical talent to go along with that. It is unfortunate they did not last into the 1990s. Their greatest hits showcases their best songs such as ""Eternal Flame"" which hit number 1 and was the last hit before they broke up. My two favorite songs on the album are "" Walking down Your Street"" and ""Walk Like and Egyptian"". This album brings back a lot of memories from the late 1980s. If you like the Bangles, they have reunited and are supposedly touring soon. Lets Hope! Anyways this album is great and you should buy it."
5,Walk down memory lane (like an Egyptian),"The Bangles, one of the great girl gorups form the days of cassette grace us with greatest hits on CD. All of your favorites are here and ready to go for a Saturday night party."
1,Disappointment,"It was very disappointmant to find out that this DVD runs only in Area 1 (US)and not in Area 2 (e.g. Europe). For the future, please, inmdicate claerly in your announcements which area the correponding DVD is working in. I do not remember seing such an undication.RegardsDr. K.-J. Melzer"
1,"Salami slicing, I'm not happy","Salami slicing is the debased practice of chopping ones research material into least publishable units, common among academics who feel that they must publish or perish. Unfortunately quantity alone will not provide lasting quality. Why Ed elected to withhold publishing all this Himalayan eye-candy from his excellent book ""No Shortcuts"", where these photos would have added so much to an already interesting story, I will never understand. Especially as there is only very little novel information about his climbs apart from the many stunning photos. Ed dropped the ball here with his publication strategy, and now his readers suffer for it."
5,Getting to Know a Very Brave Man,"This was my first exposure to a brave and very wise man, Ed Viesturs. I received the book autographed, which was a pleasant surprise. The book's revealing look at many aspects of climbing, interwoven with a story line and photos, made for a cohesively pleasant read.The combination of good writing, descriptions, and photography makes me pick up the book at random intervals to read and look again and again.I normally don't rate items five stars, but this is an exception. Without doubt, a valued book."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to K., P. is a big disappointment. What Reggio needs to learn is that once political messages are too directly inserted, art flies out the door. The message and title of this film indicate that we in the ""first world"" are guilty of living off the sweat and lifeblood of those in the ""third world."" Isn't that essentially what the artist - Reggio or any other artist - does in a metaphorical sense? Don't artists subsist on the lifeblood of patrons, or ""angels"" as Reggio calls them in the interview at the end of K.? As such, P. can be seen as a work of immense guilt and masochistic self-hate. I dearly hope that N., the third installment in this trilogy, gets back on track and gets back to art, with a less contrived Glass soundtrack."
5,"""Starry Night"" mouse pad","It's much thinner than my previous pads, but it works well-- and it's pretty."
1,This is a piece of cardboard - not a real mousepad!,"I thought this was a regular mousepad, but it is just a cheap piece of cardboard. I know why it is a ""wow"" pad now. Because when you open the box you say ""WOW, did I get ripped off""."
3,Lucy the Giant,"From the age of five lived her life without her mother. Her father is a drunken mess and the kids at school mock her for her height. Lucy turns to the one thing that understands her, Santa Barbara, a stray dog who entered Lucy's life with or without and invitation. When Santa Barbara dies Lucy feels s thought she has no one. Lucy tries to leave this life, but the question is, does she walk out the right door?Lucy the Giant is a very interesting realistic fiction book. This book would bring a smile to your face and a tug at your heart. I'd recommend this book for those who like to read about teen problems."
2,So mad!,I just bought this shelf and put it together tonight. One of the last steps is to screw the 3 wooden pegs in and guess what - they won't screw in! They just twirl in the hole and don't tighten at all. I guess I am going to have to super glue them in or somthing but it makes me so mad because the shelf wasn't cheap.
1,Broke down after 5 uses,I used this fryer five times and it broke down. I sent it to the Cuisinartrepair center in New Jersey where it is presently. In addition to what I paid for this fryer it cost me $10.00 in postage to send it to them and aadditional $10.00 to Cuisinart that they require for handling and shipping to repair it.
1,Loved the design,Wide not deep which I like. Simple operation. Worked twice now won't come on. Sturdy physically and well designed. Cheap electonics.Sending back for refund.
5,Roger Maris - Reluctant Hero,"That might be a better title than ""61*"" if for no other reason than non baseball fans might more easily recognize it for what it is - an outstanding baseball movie.Maris was portrayed as a very good baseball player; the more complete truth was that Maris was a superior ATHLETE who chose baseball over football because he did not care for life on a college campus. He was actually offered a scholarship to Oklahoma, (he still holds the national high school record for kickoff returns for touchdowns in one game) but declined after trying campus life for about a week after his high school graduation.Above all, Maris was a winner. After he left the Yankees, he finished his career with the Cardinals - played in two World Series with them and won one.See this if you get the chance, baseball fan or not.."
3,"Good story, but definitely for adults.",I didn't understand until too late that this film is filled with adult themes and language. Not one for the children.
3,61*,"The movie works great! Although, when I opened the DVD case, the clasp that holds the DVD case closed broke off...."
3,A little disappointing -,"I was at the game when this fight happened, and was so excited to get this. I must say it was a little disappointing that it was not framed as shown in the picture. Although the description did not specifically say that it was framed, the description should state that it is not framed, if what you get differs from what you see in the picture. Also, the picture of Nolan signing is of him signing something else. I thought he would be signing a picture like the one ordered here. I was still glad to get the autographed picture."
1,Don't waste your Money! The Worst Software Ever!!!,"1 star is too much for this software, i bought the same version but deluxe and is hard to work, awfull interfase, looks like windows 95 interfase, don't have good templates, the existing ones looks like a 10 years old child work, dont have a decent manual, and if you need some help the brochure inside the box has the followin note:""TECHNICAL SUPPORT $24.95 FOR THE FIRST 10 MINUTES AND $2.95 FOR EACH ADDITIONAL MINUTE"" That's a robbery to me"
5,Good short for the price,I bought this short for my wife who runs. She seems to like its comfort and fit. I think she looks nice in it. I bought Navy because another reviewer said the white was see-through. I can't say that is the case with the Navy.
3,"Great for display, NOT for playing","I wanted this just for display since I'm collecting Southwest memorabilia. I was pretty disappointed with the quality of this set. The stickers are cheaper than cheap and will probably fall off with even a little handling. If you give this to a child you might as well take the stickers off so they don't eat them. However, I bought this just to display and for that purpose it looks great!"
2,Not much use.,"If you have an older X-Box this might help with heat a tiny bit, but it will still red light on you. Probably not worth the money overall."
5,BioKleen Soy Lube SL-100,"I couldn't be happier with the quality of this product. As stated in a previous review, this is indeed a full replacement for WD-40 and/or other toxic lubricants, something I had been looking for for a long time. It is an all natural non-aerosol lubricant. All the ingredients are listed. It is non-toxic, non-flammable and ozone safe. It would be more convenient though, if it came with a straw to get into crevices."
5,"Lynda Obst's book is entertaining, thoughtful and a solid introduction to Hollywood culture","Well written, entertaining and easy to read, this book is a fun exposition of Hollywood culture, politics and the personalities involved. Despite not really being in the Hollywood business, I found this informative and something I just had to finish. Highly recommended."
1,Bitter Premium Green Tea,"I loved Stash Darjeeling Green, but it stopped being offered, so I tried their Premium Green instead. I've been drinking Green Tea for over a decade (many different types & brands), and this is the only time I couldn't enjoy it. I don't know what happened to these tea leaves - bitter's not quite the right word; it's just bad. Please bring back the Darjeeling Green."
5,Great decaf green tea,"The tea is wonderful. I have several cups per day, so I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
2,"Okay, but no Tulsi flavor","I really enjoy the flavor of Tulsi, and in this tea all I really taste is the lavender. So, if you like the taste of lavender, then this tea is for you. As for me, I think I will stick with pure Tulsi in the future."
5,Tried most varieties - this is the best!,"This is absolutely the best chai tea I have ever brewed, and I've tried well over 20 different blends from many different tea purveyors! The spices are very rich and mixed with a nice blend of green and black tea for a wonderful robust yet clean taste. I typically prefer the bolder flavor of black tea, but have found most black chai teas too bitter to drink without some sweetener. This blend is delicious as is without any sweetener, hot or cold. My search for the perfect chai tea has ended - thanks for a wonderful product!"
3,good stuff,I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty. I add some splenda and it's quite good. I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...
4,Chopped ice and a conversation piece,"Since we do not have a through the door ice dispenser with an automatic ice crusher, yet had a ""pressing"" need for crushed ice for our Mojitos I began a quest for a sturdy and effective ice crusher. After trying several of the plastic ones out there I found this one and am happy with it.The price was right, it looks good sitting on my bar shelf and, most importantly, it chops ice well. It is a little smaller than I expected but the hopper holds enough of my freezer's ""half moon"" cubes to fill a drink glass.If you are looking to crush ice for a food platter this is not your machine due to volume. It does require a bit of strength but jams are easily overcome by turning the crank in the opposite direction.One warning, the handle comes very close to the base so you do have to be careful not to catch a knuckle at the bottom of a turn."
1,Only The Cover Is Nice!,"Beautiful paperback cover . . . then the rest is copied from an old book and then copied on a page where 2/3 is blank. Every page is like this. It's blurred and hardly legible.A waste of money and my time!I bought this to give as a gift for Christmas and honestly, I think the gentleman would be insulted! Only fit for the trash unless you want to frame the cover."
3,slightly overrated,"Good, but not great. It is what it is, an action movie made like 300. Was definitely one of the,better movies I've used to burn time."
2,Clash of the Titans wannabe,"Special affects are ok, but the story line is flimsy to the point of vanishing. It bears only a passing resemblence to any mythology I have ever read, and that passing resemblence is only because it uses some of the ""gods"" names and characters. Beyond that, even Thor is more true to the myth/legend, and that is a stretch to say the least. If you are looking for a story from Greek or Roman mythology or history, keep looking. This aint it."
4,good movie,I enjoyed this movie. It was full of action. I thought it was well done. Good flow. Not everyone who watched it here liked it as much as I did. But I thought it was a good movie.
4,Well Made,"Not to often a storyline has a decent start, middle and end. that seems to tye up most loose ends. the 3d imagery is grand the Nasty creatures ugly and real enough to pop a bowl of popcorn, and enjoy an epic adventure."
2,"Action.. sure, but no story at all","This movie was basically an imitation of 300 (both in the style of the settings used and the action sequences) dropped in a Hellenic setting. Honestly, if you want a movie about the Greek Gods, watch Wrath of the Titans as it's story is a bit more engaging. It also has much better actors and the fight scenes and settings themselves are much better.Do yourself a favor and watch this for free elsewhere, preferably while you're doing something else."
1,Not worth seeing,"Was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Love Lord of the Rings, new Clash of the Titans. This movie was nothing but fighting, no real story that made any sense. It was graphic violence that was not needed throughout the entire movie. I would not have minded some of the violence if the plot or acting was any good. I find it sad that these roles are the only thing Mickey Rourke seems to get. My husband and I found it so boring that we shut it off halfway through. There have only been a few movies that we have shut off and not given a chance. We were really disappointed. If you need to see it, rent it, don't buy it. Hope this helps!!"
3,"It's ok. Not a ""meaty"" movie, but entertaining","All in all it was ok. Storyline could be improved, but it's a movie about a nobody rising up to be somebody playing off of greek mythology. It reminded me of like hercules meets 300. I wanted a better ending, but for all who are movie buff and have 2 hours to kill. IT's definiltey action packed (most of the time), has some really cool scenery/ graphics and they also show the girl from ""slumdog millionaire"" naked from her backside. Godbless~shaun's movie review"
2,Not sure..,"I'm actually not even sure why this is on here. Maybe someone else bought it? I don't know, but I wouldn't buy this."
4,Good Movie.,"I have to say that I wanted to see this movie really for its 'special effects' and that it would just be an 'okay' movie (that would be driven by its special effects) but I was surprised. It was a good movie (Action, Special effects and good story line). It's hard to say if you should 'own' or 'rent' it. I do 'own' it."
3,Decent but not what it could have been.,"Mickey Rourke is a terrible actor. He anticipates action with pre reaction and says his lines like he has something in his mouth in an attempt to be more macho. He was a detraction from the movie. The storyline was entertaining but it amazed me after having found the bow and having fended off so much to keep it, he couldn't hang on to it. It was an ok movie."
4,Decide for yourself,"Not so bad at all. It was an entertaining film. I enjoyed the story, I didn't have to adjust my brightness at all and the acting was fine. Those were the main complaints that made me hesitate. You'll have to watch and judge for yourself. It seems to be a love-hate kind of flick for most. Enjoy!"
2,Waste of time and money,Terrible movie with about 5 minutes of good action and dialog. Much of the cinematography was dark and hard to see. Don't waste your money like I did!
2,Average Film,"A bit slow and the plot wasn't very interesting. Whenever the gods appeared it was more exciting; however, those moments were very very few and far between.The movie lacks any real emotion and comes across as your average film with lazy writing."
3,Bloody !,Mickey Rourke is excellent in his part. Good story line. Just a little too bloody. The screen was a little darker than comfortable in places but it did not deter from the movie.
1,Tarsem Singh makes pretty movies. This one happens to be pretty bad as well.,"Tarsem Singh makes pretty movies. This one happens to be pretty bad as well with atrocious, leaden dialog and a barely existent plot. The visual style of the movie is so thoroughly artificial looking that the settings lose any impact. The costumes and the bodies they adorn are pretty nice, though.Definitely see Tarsem Singh'sThe Fallthough, to see why Immortals is such a disappointment."
3,"I enjoyed this movie, but","So this is a just a rip off of 300 and Clash of the Titans, but i still enjoyed the movie. The plot was very weak and the acting was only ok.The fact that zeus wouldn't allow the gods to help and then it end the way it did really annoyed me, but the special effects where detailed and way better then 300 and clash of the titans and that saved the movie."
3,Eye-candy & blood,There is definitely enough eye-candy to watch for all sexes in this film! The script is not very exciting but the film manages to keep you glued to the screen.
2,Digital copy doesn't work-- they sent me a Canada-only redemption code,"I bought this 3D/BluRay/DVD set with digital copy. However, upon attempting to perform the digital copy download, I discovered that the included code was only valid in Canada!! AMazon should refund a part of my purchase cost or provide a replacement digital copy code that can be redeemed in the U.S."
1,Immortals 3D,Immortals 3D (3D Blu-ray / 2D Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) (Blu-ray)This movie was not 1 hour & 50 minutes as advertised. Instead it was 1 hour & 42 minutes. It also was not the same Version I saw in the Cinema. In my opinion it is probably the same Version rated PG15 that is also 1 hour & 42 minutes sold in the UK.
5,Great For My Kids!,"I was surprised at how good the DVDs are. The price is so low I guess I wasn't expecting too much. It's definitely the best bargain I've seen for learning toys. My kids are 3 and 6 and they both have fun playing. It was so nice seeing them playing the games instead of just watching the video. It's a little complicated to set up, but not too bad. It was easier than the remote for my cable TV. They have more videos at their website, so I was glad about that! Their website has extra help setting it up, so if you get one check that out."
4,Definately worth the wait,"I've been waiting for a Saxon set with some of the newer songs for years now, and I am thankful to finally have it. The set list is a couple songs short, but still impressive none the less. Bottom line is Saxon deserves to be held in the same respect as PRIEST, AC/DC, MAIDEN, OZZY, as well as the other power house hard rock/metal bands that are much more popular. It's a shame these guys haven't received the same following. I definately look forward to any new Saxon material, they rock like it should be rocked! With all that said. Biff sounds great, he's still breaking Mic's with his voice. Guitars, Quinn and Scarratt are on point, their sound is perfect, chops are huge, riffs thunderous. Nibbs on bass, he's all over the place and doesn't miss a thing. Fritz Randow on the drums, you gotta be kidding me, where did this guy come from? Very Heavy, Very impressive! Buy it now and enjoy!!!"
2,NOT the real thing!,"Saxon is 2 bands now. The Biff Byford and Paul Quinn led version on the DVD and the Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson led version. Buy ""Rock has Landed"" DVD by Oliver/Dawson Saxon it is a better representation of the band as they were during the NWOBHM. Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson were the founders (not Biff Or Paul). The band was called SOB in the beginning. That band also had Haydn Conway on guitar. The band changed to Saxon later. Haydn Conway is in the O/D Saxon version too. Steve Dawson wrote the majority of the classic material and Saxon suffered when he left. He did not like the direction the band was going. Saxon Chronicles is horrible sounding and just a shadow of what Saxon once was. Ideally a classic show with Biff Byford,Paul Quinn,Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson needs to come out. For now between the 2 versions, skip this and BUY ""Rock has landed"" that's how these songs were meant to sound!"
3,just an intro,"This book has some good information and a couple of good indexes and lists of things you don't find like login script variables and a couple of good appendixes, but it's not as thorough as it should be considering its size. there is a lot of repitition including direct cutting and pasting of small sections. Also it doesn't have nearly the amount of Active Directory info I expected.It's just an introduction to win2k with a couple of nice bonuses, but it's not enough to get out there and set up a network with."
1,Awful,"This movie was boring and VERY slow moving, the plot was terrible and the acting stunk. It was of low budget homemade quality. The camera was shakey, the lighting was anything but good, and we went 45 minutes into the movie without one single kill. It's the kind of movie where the voices are low, then the music and bass are REALLY loud. I HATE THAT!!! The gore factor was non existent and the scare wasn't there. I'd say avoid this one at all cost!"
3,Too fast,The instructor doesn't really teach. She just does her thing and you have to move quick. I am 40 and it was too fast paced. Like another reviewer said. She's just too thin makes you want to eat more. I am going to keep at it and pause and practice and see if I can improve.
4,Good work out,"This is fun work out- lots of variety. I love to dance and being a bit of a klutz, I find the choreography a little more effort than I really like in an aerobic workout."
4,Not for beginners but great workout,"It took a while to get the hang of it, but once I nailed the steps down, it was fun and really got me sweating. The only thing that I got tired of was hearing her say ""Give me some attitude"", other than that, I highly recommend this video for intermediate exercisers."
1,Hard to follow,"I found these steps so hard to learn and I don't consider my uncoordinated (I have learned a lot of other workouts without problems). I wanted to throw this one in the garbage too. The music doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rhythm of the steps, and instructor is annoying."
3,It's okay,"I bought this to replace the Pampered Chef slicer and thought I could not go wrong with Zyliss. The guard does not always slide well. I have to use a little vegetable oil to make it slide nicely. It slices well. I use this mostly for celery. However the julienne cuts are difficult. It's hard to push the vegetables through them. Also the blades for the julienne custs bend after a few uses. Most of the time, I don't bother taking the slicer out, I just use my knife.Update. Discovered that the problem with Julienne cuts are not with the blades, but with the guard. When I oiled the guard or did not use the guard, the julienne cuts went much easier. Don't recommend using w/out the guard. Blades are so sharp."
4,It is a photographic journal not a guide book,"Mattias Klum is a very famous nature photographer, who has a unique style. He is not into just making portraits of animals and birds. Every photograph of his that I have seen communicates a whole story of the things he is taking pictures of. He has spent considerable time in rain forests, and communicates his experience very well.Unfortunately, most of his books are printed only in Swedish, and he has not not got as much exposure outside here. You should check out other books by him too.Mattias's work also exhibits a different nature photographic aesthetic from what most people in North America are used to seeing."
4,Great,"This book is great. Really enjoyed all the back story and interviews. It is a must have for ""Friday"" fans! Well done."
1,Bonide Garden Dust from Ozbo,"I did not receive the item shown. I selected the item because it claimed to contain rotenone, both as shown on the label and in the description. The formulation I received does not contain rotenone and is not labelled for the insect problem or crop that I purchased it for. (The name of the item is still Bonide Garden Dust, but is a different formulation.)"
1,Disappointed!,I bought this item because it claimed to be organic but when i received it doesn't sayanything about Organic. I am very disappointed!
5,Lucio Fulci's 8 1/2 !,"Maybe one of the most bizarre horror-comedies ever made. If you're a fan of 'the master' are will be delighted my this extremely violent, yet funny film."
2,Mee-awful!,"Cheesy music, poor dubbing, glaring continuity errors, dodgy acting (not the least from Fulci himself) and buckets of often less-than-convincing gore. Even the cat looks ridiculously fake!What was Fulci thinking of? If intended as a (cat got yer-)tongue-in-cheek satirical comment, it should have been sharper and wittier. If intended as grand guignol horror, it should have been darker and more menacing.Just about saved from being a lone-star movie by the interest value of seeing Fulci himself and the variety of butchery just may melt the hardened gore-fan's butter.On the whole very disappointing though."
3,cheapness makes me feel better...,"I'm ordinarily staunchly loyal to Lonely Planet, but the Buenos Aires guide reviews were so awful that I though I'd give something else a try. The first thing I noticed was that it's full of advertisements. In fact, nearly half of all the photos contained are ads. And the list price on the back is $19.95! Man, if I'd paid that much for this book, I'd be furious. It also seems a bit flimsy, like a thick pamphlet they might give away for free at a tourist office, althout I haven't used it in the city yet so I suppose we'll see how it holds up. The writing, though, is on par with the Lonely Planet guides I have (good) with a somewhat more of a focus on high end establishments.All in all, it isn't bad by any means, but I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it."
2,"Not what the picture shows, and damaged to boot","Ok, so they would probably be perfectly functional tongs. I didn't find out because I decided to return them about as soon as I opened the box. The picture shows a pair of tongs made of colorless transparent plastic. The pair I received were not colorless but bright yellow - not at all what I wanted. In addition, although the packaging was undamaged, the tongs themselves had small scratches all over, and a few spots were so scratched up that the transparent plastic looked opaque. They are going straight back to Amazon."
4,Good Product for all WTE Students,"Great product. Very simple language for all of the cases. However, beware that a new edition of the text book came out with in the past couple of years so not every one of the cases in my new edition of the text book are covered in Legallines. Very good product though."
4,A Work of Art From the Beautiful Milcha Sanchez-Scott,"This intriguing and tantalizing play throws the reader into the world of cockfighting. With its sweet and angelic character Angela and her harsh, but protective brother, Hector, we learn of the world of a gallero's family. With the return of there father, Gallo, Hector and Angela are thrown back to the past, remembering how obsessed there father is with roosters. Gallo, the father, is back from prison after serving time for killing a man over a rooster. Along with the story line of Hector accepting his father back, two shadow characters appear trying to find Gallo and an aunt who could have slept with her brother and her nephew."
2,"Some good things, mostly bad","This book was used in my daughter's 7th graded science class, along with a secular text book. I was impressed at how well the authors were able to show that the glory of God can be seen throughout creation. They present this message in a way that can be understood by 7th graders, and capture their interest. But be warned: this is a ""Young Earth Creationist"" textbook. In a single read through the book, I found about 20 instances where the authors blatantly distorted or misrepresented scientific information in order to make it fit their young-earth agenda. But most of the book's problems are errors of omission, rather than commission. (For example, the book totally overlooks the evidence for an expanding universe--possibly the greatest scientific discovery of all time!) Consequently, balancing this book with a more secular book makes a reasonable combination."
5,"Rational, unbiased reports","The author has made an extensive research on the remedies written about in his book. At the end of the book, he has also advised on how we should accept or not accept old remedies or even modern or popular medical habits - he does not rule out modern medicines. I think a very rational view and discussion was presented.Like all views given, of course there will definitely be some people who would strongly disagree and deny the book's integrity outright. However to benefit more from intelligence of this book is to have an open mind. Even at the end of the book, I can't bring myself to agree on the urine remedy - but I accept the clear explanations given.I don't normally buy books and initially I borrowed it from the library, but I'm buying it because I think it's a good book to have for reference at home."
4,Great Design,"I bought this as a gift for someone who is extremely picky about kitchen accoutrements. It was well received and fits in with the rest of the decor and items. It is not currently being used for bread, so I can't speak to that, but the design is wonderful and it keeps crackers and spices fresh."
1,Little Bits of Black Plastic in My Cheese,"My husband gave me this grater for Christmas because he knows how much I love my other Microplanes. It grated pieces of itself into the parmesan. Neither one of us could figure out why, and the more we fiddled with it, the more obvious it became that this is not a good product."
3,Ok,"When i saw it online i was happy with the shoe that i got it and was nice,but the sizes are small so you will need to get a biger size then normal."
4,Great though children may find it offputting,"Just received the cocoa and tried it out with my two children. My older child liked it (after I ""spiked"" the drink with lots of whipped cream to sweeten it) but my younger child would not have anything to do with it. I could definitely taste the premium chocolate in it and that's exactly the point. I personally much prefer it to the overtly-sweetened Swiss Miss variety, the same way I prefer chocolate that tastes like real cocoa and never touch Hershey's unless desperate... A great bargain now."
4,Excellent Hot chocolate,The flavor is rich and delicious. The ingredients are ideal ( with no corn syrup or artificial flavors). I only deduce a star because I think it's a little overpriced.
4,Very Rich tasting.,"Good quality, low price.This is a rich chocolate. I blend it with sweeter cocoa such as Swiss MIss or Sacco cocoa"
5,Ghiradelli Hot Chocolate is Great,My grandson thinks this is the best hot chocolate he has ever had in his life. He is 12 =). I enjoy it also.
3,Better Than Most,"It does Not say Organic but where to find pure chocolate at a reasonable price I do Not know but this Is close to It, other brands may have dead Animals In It with mad Cow disease. I like the taste of Nestle hot chocolate better but It has unknown stuff In It, but I still have to put In the microwave to kill the bacteria."
5,much better quality and taste than powedered packages,I bought this product to replace the packages of powdered cocoa mix (several brands) that I found where making me feel unwell. I checked ingredient's on those packages which had a list of as many as 26 additives/chemicals etcI am a big fan of Ghirardelli chocolates and eat it almost exclusively so the logical solutions was to try their hot cocoa. I am very happy with the taste and price and the more and fewer natural ingredients. I add it to my coffee in the morning to make my poor man's cafe mocha.
4,PERFECT BUT DRAINS BATTERIES,Works as advised! My luthier's suggestion was to set the internal volume on the MAXIMUM and set the right amount live because on a Clean Guitar Sound blend will sound much higher but as soon as you start to go crazy with your guitar rig you will feel the need to a little boost on the Piezo sound and I have since mine was set on the Maximum.The downside is that this is a Battery Eater! KEEP IT UNPLUGGED AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT PLAYING!!!Even if I unplug on the breaks it lasts for about 6 hours playing in my calculations. I'm looking now for a solution such as buying a 1Spot adapter for 9V AC Adapter and I'll start to use it at home practicing and on gigs that I'll play seated. (as long as this don't add noise and hum on the sound!)
4,Comical look at Globalization,I really enjoyed this book. Fisgon uses comic panels to illustrate the ups and downs of globalization while also provided a very intelligent researched history into it. The book may drone every now and then but it is worth it for the point he is trying to make.
5,travel dog crate,"After researching travel crates for my new lab rescue, your crate was recommended by a friend. Not only do I love it because of the size and ease of setting it up, my dog,Georgia, absolutely LOVES it.I highly recommend it. Good product for the price. Money well spent."
3,My dog doesn't love it.,"We bought this for our crate-trained 5 month old lab puppy. She loves her metal crate at home, and hoped this would work at the beach house, and be portable enough for travel use if required. Both are sized the same. The first time in use, I put our 7-year old lab in with her, and they figured out how to unzip it and escape! I'm more careful now, but the pup, now 7 months old, is always reluctant to be crated in this one."
1,Very flimsy!,"This is a super flimsy crate. My 2 1/2 year old dog seemed to like the crate. I introduced it to him slowly with treats and letting him just go in and lay down at will. He is used to being confined to a regular metal crate most days when I go to work and has always been fine. But the first time I actually left him in this Firstrax crate, I came home and he had busted through one of the flimsy zippers. I fixed the zipper and tried it again. The second time I left him, he just tore the fabric along a seam and got out. I couldn't believe how flimsy this product is. It might be okay for an older dog or very low energy dog, but it can't stand up to a more energetic dog."
4,Great Product Overall,"This is my first NOZTONOZ sof-crate. I read a bunch of reviews on here before I purchased. Some reviews said that it had a smell to it. Well they must have fixed that cuz it doesnt smell at all.It was a little tricky to learn to set up and take down for the first time, but once I learned which side goes first its a peice of cake now. I like that is had a nice handle for carrying, and for the size its very lightweight. I bought this for my 120lb great dane. who is abou 30 inches at the withers. The length and width are plenty for her, and since she is a little tall I love that it has the zip-open roof. I use this crate for dog shows, and when I am around the kennels I can open the roof and let her stick her head out. She really likes this.Great product, I wouldnt reccommend for a puppy who might chew, as this is made of nylon, and mesh screen."
3,crate,"Love the set up, it's easy,,, but the covering isn't as tight of fit as my larger crate. Like to put things on top and this one sages.But all in all nice."
2,Awful odor,"This is the second Fistrax N2-36 NOZTONOZ Sof-Krate Indoor/Outdoor Pet Home that we have purchased. We found the first one (and this, too) to be sturdier than others and easy to set up (no pinched fingers). However, this one, a week after delivery, is still sitting outside airing. The strong odor seems to be emanating from the polyester bottom. We don't dare put a dog in it as the smell is overwhelming and unhealthy."
5,Travel Crate,"Sets up quickly, folds flat quickly, easy to carry and pack. Easy access ventilation screens on the top and front of the crate. Well constructed for it's design. My crate trained dogs were leary going in it to at first, but after taking meals inside with the door open, they were comfortable entering the crate. I use the 42"" size for my 70# Golden with plenty of room for him. I am able to house the Golden and a 35# Aussie mix together for short stretches when needed. Did not have the odor issue reported in other reviews. Collaping the crate properly has a learning curve and instructions are not included. Take note of the folding pattern when this is first set up. Would buy this again. Not made for a crate chewer or digger."
3,predictable but a good read,"Not an overly complicated plot (introverted boy meets antisocial girl, her actions bring him out of his shell). Rather good characterizations and very real feeling dialog.A good quick read that shows the author has imagination and talent. He seems to have restricted himself in trying to simplify this book for a young teen audience.I would like to see more of these characters and some more adult themed work by this author in the future."
1,dishonest,"I did not know until I received the book that the diet did not apply to myself, being 67 years old, and a few other disqualifiying events. A waste of money."
4,Hoppy's guns blaze across the screen in vol 3,"Once again Hopalong Cassidy rides across the screen guns a blazing. If you want to go back to your early days when movies were a treat get this collection of Hopalong Cassidy (William Boyd)movies. ""In Old California"" is a classic in which Hoppy comes to the rescue of a friend of Hoppy's boss. It is full of action, suspense, and any movie with California Carlson is always a belly laugh that we all need from time to time.These movies are perfect for the parent concerned with what their children watch on TV. They are full of examples supplied by Hoppy, California, and Lucky showing how to live without drinking alcohol, smoking, or use of bad language. They never harm or show disrespect to women, and are a great visual example of how to be an adult, for all kids to see and admire."
5,Monique'a review,This Dewalt saw is an awesome piece of equipment. I should have bought this long ago. What was I thinking?
2,Stops and starts by itself,I bought my dewalt about 2 yrs ago. Having problems with themotor stops and then I have to tap on it to get it to run.For the money the quality is not there and I am a big dewalt buyer and fan. Not sure if after I try to get it serviced if I will purchase another dewalt saw or not.
5,DeWalt reputation!,I bought this as an anniversary gift for my spouse and he loves it. I purchased it based on the DeWalt reputation and my spouse has an entire collection! Very nice and nice case!
5,A Beautifully Written Book,Angels in the Dust is a beautifully written book about life during the Dust Bowl. The story is touching and Margot Theis Raven has a true talent of writing. The illustrations are breathtaking!!!
4,Very helpful and informative reference book.,I found this book to be extremely helpful in identifying popular linen styles and items for a collector. The pictures were clear and the descriptions sufficient for my needs. This is a good addition to a collector's library.
4,What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.,"Questions of faith,family bonds, psychic ability,dark forces, personal strength, intrique & redemption all come together in this harrowing tale. Good stuff."
3,I'm not totally crazy about this one,"Jeanie Marshall's voice - whispering - was a little hard for me to get used to. While it isn't the worst one I've ever listened to, there are others that I like a lot better. I've listened to it about 6 times, and I think I've only fallen asleep once, while listening. I've given several of mine away because I thought they were awful. I'll keep this one for now, but not sure I'll keep it forever."
5,The best series I've read,This book and its sequels are the best series of books I have ever read! I would really like to see John Peel write a 7th and 8th sequel and then develop it on-these books are really great and I think they will please a lot of kids if they become really popular!
4,"A tough, gritty view of the ""other"" Vietnam war","This film is an excellent story of the first Vietnam War, the one that involved the French. The French involvement in Vietnam is not that well known in the USA. However, those that see this film will be interested to know that battle have been fought in that country for many years. Pierre Schoendoerffer, the director and Raul Courtard, the cinematographer are both veterans of the French conflict in Vietnam (Indo-China). The 317 Platoon tells the story of a group of French soldiers and their Latoian allies who trek through the jungle to the saftey of a French outpost. They a pursued by the Viet-Minh, and the odds of them reaching safety get longer avery day."
1,We received a Defective Mixer,This is a really defective and dissapointing mixer. The motor works but the transmission is bad in it. To add insult upon injury I had gotten it as a gift for my wife and we just got around to attempting to use it so the 30 day return policy is expired so amazon wont replace it. Highly recommend buying one locally if your looking for one because if yours breaks like ours has the nearest service center is 75 miles away.
1,Great features but dangerous flaw,"I bought this Sunbeam model b/c of its history. However, after just 4 uses or ordinary ingredients (cake batters only)the screw holding the beaters together came apart. I was uncertain if it washed down the drain or was in the product I just made. Customer service was not very helpful and offered to replace the beater....yeah....I'm going to take that chance again and end up having to throw away $25+ of cake and icing b/c of a design flaw. This model beats Kitchen Aid anyday with its fantastic ease of use, but the other ratings are correct with the tilt button very hard to use and it does seem to sling ingredients across the kitchen. I do NOT recommend this until the flaw is corrected. Buyer and owners beware!"
3,Sunbeam Mixer Model # 2346,"This is my first stand mixer and mostly I like it. However, I mainly purchased it to knead bread. As soon as the dough is mixed and becomes heavier, the bowl jiggles back and forth and rattles. The metal turn table can be wiggled back and forth a little even when not on. Anyone have this problem? Is this ""normal?"""
5,SUNBEAM is SUPERIOR TO KITCHEN AID,"I HAVE GIVEN MY TWO DAUGHTERS THE BEST KITCHEN AID MIXERSTHEY BOTH HATE THEM !!! THEY ARE SO HEAVY AND OF COURSE DO NOT MIX AS THESUNBEAM THEY GREW UP WITH. I AM GIVING ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS MY OLD SUNBEAM, TELLING HER SHE COULD GO THE THE APPLIANCE REPAIR STORE IN ATLANTA , BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME LIKE I USE TO.I HAD A RESTARTANT AT ONE TIME AND HAD A KITCHEN AID----------IT WASHORRIBLE. GUESS WHAT YOU LIKE, BUT I TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET MY SUNBEAM AND I LOVE IT. HAVE'NT USED THAT MUCH SO FAR, BUT IT DOES WHAT I LIKE,THE BOWL CAN'T TURN LIKE IT USE TO BUT GUESS I WILL HAVE TO ADJUST TO THAT."
1,What happened to the Sunbeam I grew up with?,This is a terrible mixer. If you have anything thick that you need to mix (bread for example) you are running a risk of burning out your motor. My mixer has already been replaced 2 times and I have only owned it for 2 months. I called into Sunbeam service center and spoke to a rude young woman who instructed me to take it to my local repair shop. When I called the local repair shop and described the problem they told me that they could fix the product but the problem would happen again because the motor is not strong enough to mix bread! What happened to the Sunbeam that my mother owned? The one that lasted 30 years even though it fell off the counter twice? I am currently arguing with Sunbeam management about getting my money back on this mixer - don't make the same mistake I did.
2,not good,"bought a 350W version which mechanically is the same thing. Incompetent design imo. Rickety bowl rotation mechanism and equally loose motor pivot makes for pitiful sight when working on tougher dough. Very inconvienient tilt release. Noisy and it sounds incompetent. Motor tends to run hot, which is not surprising given that there is no gearing (like in Kitchen Aid) to allow it work efficiently. Electronic speed controls are by definition poorly suited for mixing tasks. Top handle got loose on third use. Returned to store one week later."
1,A real disappointment,"Got one of these as a gift from my favorite sister in law. I always wanted one, but the beaters were nearly impossible to eject and about six months later, the motor froze while I was making meringues. I complained to Sunbeam, and without consulting me, they immediately sent me a brand new one, beaters, bowls and all. When I said I didn't want to send the broken one back, they instructed me to just ""cut off the cord"" and keep the bowls and beaters as spares. It started to sound as if this was a common occurance. When I set up the replacement, the motor that drove the bowl turntable didn't work. My husband took the motor for the bowl stand from the ""old"" mixer and put it in the ""new"" mixer, so now I have a working mixer...but for how long? I don't care if his repair job invaldated the warranty. If this one breaks, I WON'T be getting another Sunbeam."
5,Very Sturdy,"Replaces an older cheaper unit which was mostly plastic. This is much nicer; however, it is more expensive. You get what you pay for."
1,Tricked and forgotten,I ordered the Sunbeam mixer from Orange onion through the Amazon site. The mixer recieved was a cheaper model than the one I ordered with no price reducrion offered. I returned the item in January and am still waiting for a refund in mid march. Orange onion was not true to their good words. They did not return any voice mail messages and emails were answered with form policy statements. I would not order from Orange onion again.
2,Not up to his other books.,"Golf and the Spirit just doesn't come up to M. Scott Peck's bestseller The Road Less Traveled.He promises golfers and nongolfers alike that this book will ""go beyond mechanics to explore the deeper issues, ways of successfully managing the emotional, psychological, and spiritual aspects"" of the game of golf. Unfortunately, it seems to read more like Peck's frustrations of the game, and less about the ultimate metaphor for life. Too bad."
2,Way over rated.,"I own over a thousand cd's; most in the pop/rock, powerpop spirit. Do I like the Beatles? Of course. Do I like this; no. Sorry, didn't do it for me. Not any muscle in here at all, and I'm left with nary a memorable moment. This cd is not horrid, but does not nearly live up to the reviews."
4,Love them but a little less firm than I thought,"I love these baskets they are great for bloomer, hat, socks, sheets and changing pad covers. Well that's what I use mine for. I bought two of these and though I like them, I thought that the actual basket would be more firm/sturdy. It's not floppy or anything but compared to a wicker basket it's soft. The chenille liner is great it's a little big but who cares the colors are great!"
1,Stop! Don't Buy This Ink! These are refilled! Not HP Vivera Ink!,"I just installed the Light Gray ink which my ProB8850 identified as ""refilled"". The printer message claims ink level indicators do not work with refilled inks. I contacted HP who claimed using unathorized ink could affect the printer's warranty. I called Amazon's customer service to get this bogus product refunded or replaced and they opted to refund. Stay away from Amazon's 38 Inks! The packaging looked like the real thing and the website's discription repeatedly refered to the quality HP product they were selling. I have purchased 38 inks here before without a problem -Amazon is now misrepresenting the products they sell. They claim I will receive a full credit in 2 - 3 days. I will repost when I see this happen."
3,Only hard case to fit Barnett bow but needs design changes,"Had to heat top to stretch it to fit reddot scope on Barnett crossbow. Arrow holder does not hold arrows very well and hard to find room for quiver. The design is close to being great, just needs some further improvement."
5,nice bow case,"This bow case is well made, and the ONLY case I found that will fit the large barnett crossbows(ghost 400 & 350 and also the predator) which I have. The lid strap won't support the lid weight so use it with some velcro, and rivets to make holders for storage box. You will need to hot glue the foam in place or it will come out some times. The lid will hold 20"" bolts but a 22"" bolt with tips are a real stretch. I laid the quiver upside down along the rail with some foam and made a velcro stap to keep it there(fits great). There is plenty of room for cocking devices, boxes, ect... I just made it the way that worked for me. Dosn't come with a shoulder strap so you will want to add one because the case will get heavy fully loaded. good luck."
3,sturdy,"doesn't fit a Barnett quad 400 very well. I have to take the scope and quiver off every time and still have to force it shut. this case does not seem like it will fit a wide verity of bows. its big, its bulky, you can find better. go to a local shop and check the fit before buying this online. also runs about the same price in chain sporting good stores. wish i would have gone with a different option."
2,Crossbow with scope does not fit,I am disappointed and returned this item when I found that the Barnett Quad 400 does fit only without a scope mounted on it.When I mounted the scope the cover will not close.I returned the item and got full refund. Thanks to seller.I gave it 2 stars because of seller professional act.
5,It works!,"I have used this product multiple times to start quarantine tanks and hospital tanks (marine tanks, with both fish and coral.) It works; it's worked every time. I've never had my tanks spike ammonia or nitrite when using this product as directed. I'm amazed how many websites & forums claim that no such product exists. Also, the reviewer who says that you have to keep using it is wrong, for so many reasons (the bacteria don't get used up and die, they multiply, just like all bacteria, and also, all of the bacteria that would normally be in your tank if you cycle the traditional way will also still exist in the tank.) I've never used the product beyond 7 days, not even with water changes, and my tanks have never ""crashed"" when I stopped using this. I would, however, consider stocking the tank lightly, and gradually building up stock."
5,Great Nail Gun!,"No issues with mine, great handling, nails set perfect everytime, quieter than most, and oil-free! I have used different sized nails with no problem. Buy one it's great!"
4,"A proven product----if it ain't broke, don't fix it!","This is the second one of this tool I have purchased, the first one I bought about 10 years ago. It finally died and new parts cost more than a new gun. Surprisingly, after receiving my new one, I find that it is exactly like my old one. Not even one little improvement. Even though it is a good product, I expected maybe a little smoother trigger or a better paint job, but, alas nothing. It is a very good nail gun and I'm happy with my second one now, but maybe I just expected too much. Yes, I'd buy it again."
2,VERY VERY VERY BASIC HEADSET,"The unit is OK and will give you about 1-2 hours of talk time, just don't move more then 4 feet from the phone or you will be talking to yourself. It is very comfortable, kind of like using nothing at all. The unit requires a full(At least 2-3 hours) of charging to work well. (The in house charging unit/plug is unique and will not support most phones, so no double use here) JUST REMEMBER WHAT MOM TOLD YOU, ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR""."
1,Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage,I too was so disappointed in this movie. I wish I could give it 0 stars and get my $20.00 back. It's hard to believe Thomas Kinkade has his name on it. I definitely have a different opinion about him now. All of the foul language and distasteful jokes about sex are not what I would call family entertainment. What kind of a father brings porn to there sons? Call me old fashion but maybe that's why this country is in the shape it's in. I guess Thomas has let the money go to his head and he'll stoop to any level to get it. This could have been just as good without all the garbage.
4,A nice Christmas story,"This was a lovely Christmas story loosely based on the life of Thomas Kinkade. What I enjoyed most was the relationship between Thomas and his mentor, Glen. Peter O'Toole does a tremendous job portraying the famous artist and I became extremely fond of him in this movie. Their relationship is very inspiring. For me, the story was very real to life--portraying life struggles that can be seen on just about every corner. Family loyalty and love (between Thomas and is mother and brother) and community spirit were all prominently shown here and acted as a reminder of what can ""be"". If you are a fan of the late artist's wonderful paintings, you won't want to miss this touching story about how Kinkade's paintings came to life...""paint the light, Thomas!"""
1,Disappointing,"This movie is not at all like Christmas Lodge - it is definitely not family friendly. The language is appalling for a family movie and it was a huge disappointment that the language made what would have been a good movie, one that was not even watchable."
3,Great Premise - Poor delivery,"I had high hopes for this movie for several reasons:1. I love Christmas2. I love Thomas Kincaid (I own 5 prints)3. The lineup is star-studdedHowever, hopes and reality don't always mesh. That was the case in this movie. I can't understand how a movie with this many stars failed to deliver. Ed Asner and Chris Elliot, who are both in the movie, the former only for a few minutes, are not even listed in most credits - were they disappointed in the final product and asked not to be listed? Anyway, it has a great message and except for some mild profanity, is pretty close to a family movie. If you are into art, and especially Thomas Kincaid, this movie is very informative. It is almost worth the cost just for the Thomas Kincaid interview. I'd love to rate it higher but I feel that 3 stars is being generous."
1,Major major disappointment,"The picture on the cover seemed so enduring that I anticipated another christmas classic that my family and I could watch for years to come. To my horror not only will I never watch this movie again but thank goodness I turned it off before my children could be exposed to the rauchiness of the movie. If I was Thomas Kinkade I would be thoroughly embarrass by this movie. My heart goes out to Mr. Kinkade if this was an accurate portrail of his life but for goodness sake don't make a ""family christmas"" movie about it. Do I really need to see a TV dad try to grab his own son's crotch???? or for that matter give him ""smut"" magazines??? It was just a really bad movie. I brought it in my house one day in one piece and it left the next day in manny pieces. I wouldn't feel right passing this mess on to someone else."
4,A very sweet movie!,"I bought this because I'm a big fan of Jared Padelecki. It's a very sweet and enjoyable movie that I would recommend watching with the family for Christmas. However, one complaint I do have is that the sound on the DVD is horrible, even with the volume all the way up it was difficult to hear and understand some of the dialogue.But, in short a very enjoyable movie."
5,"Wonderful, Heartwarming Movie!","I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. I had never heard anything about it and knew very little about Thomas Kincade and his work. It was a wonderful, heartwarming movie. Perfect for the holidays! The lead actor, the one who plays Thomas, was wonderful. I am not sure why I haven't seen more of him on the big screen. Other reviews talk about the language and how it isn't a family movie. Although I didn't watch it with my daughter, I didn't think that the language was anything outlandish. The subject matter wouldn't hold a young child's attention anyways--so this movie is really best for adults or older/teen children.Take the time to watch this movie...you will be glad you did!"
3,Nice deal but.,"When I got this I was excited to see how well it did. The rear flasher is great, but the headlight's not so great. Go with a better set or indevidual's like I finally had to."
5,beautiful laundry basket,"I have been looking everywhere for a very simple laundry hamper to put in my daughters room and this is perfect. The colors are soft and muted and nothing is loud, so it blends right in, rather then sticking out like a sore thumb. 5 stars!!"
3,"Adorable hamper, but not well made","I have had this hamper for 10 months. I decided to wash (by hand) the outside part of the hamper (not the mesh lining). I hung it up to air dry. All looked well, until I went to go put it back on the actual wooden legs. The material had shrunk and it would no longer fit properly around the wooden ""legs"" of the hamper. I was very disappointed."
2,Love the look but not durable,I love the look of this hamper and the mesh insert is a good idea. The problem I have with this hamper is that it isn't made very well. After 9 months of use two of the hooks on the mesh insert have come off. (They are attached with glue instead of sewn on) Also the edges on the main hamper of the are coming apart. For the price of this item I would have thought it was better put together.
3,Welcome to the city of Death,"The tank looks cool when you open the box but its got some problems. Many times, some sea-monkeys get stuck behind the buildings and other times they just die. You also have to change the water often because if you don't, the buildings will turn black."
4,For followers of Good Music.,Very good. I would have given it a 5 but my interest was in some tracks that that did not duplicate others previously purchased. For anyone interested in music from an era of great artists - this is one to have.Angelo (USC)
5,Great album full of good tracks,"The debut of the dutch R&B Band Sat-r-day is very strong. Not only does it contain the European club hit ""Steelo"" but also funky groovin tracks like ""Down low""(ft. G.M.Tzz) or smooth soft ballads like ""The weekend is for you"". Very convincing voices, strong beats and interesting productions make this a wonderful R&B album."
3,Mine is out the door,"I think I purchase this machine back in 2006 on Ebay as a refurbished and paid 119.00 for it. Well the automatic threader worked couple of times and never again. It was hard to find a brother service dealer and they were not very helpful on the phone. The tension kept jamming and after a local service, the spool of thread kept getting caught in the automatic threader.This machine came with lots of foot parts.Since I purchased this on Ebay , being fair, I made a beautiful quilt with this machine but I kept encountering problems and machine did not last long. I will look for another machine but will buy it from a store this time."
3,DVD,This is a great movie but I was disappointed with the video quality. There are a few fuzzy spots and the disc was ratteling arround in then case when I recieved it. Needs more attention to packing and handeling.
4,R Lee Ermey Kicks Butt in His Debut Movie,"If Your a true R Lee Ermey Fan, You've got to add this movie to your collection. Ermey is in true form (Before full metal Jacket). So If You want to see why Stanley Kubric picked R Lee Ermey for full metal jacket, get the Boys in Company ""C"". I'm a former Marine and Love this Movie. OOHRAH!!!!!!"
5,Works at advertised,"When used to bounce flash from a ceiling, this product does work. However, when I use it as a direct flash (90 degree angle) it produces shadows and a dark output. I don't know why. I would assume it would diffuse the light and produce even tones."
2,Blah,It's really not worth it. I have one and it's disappointing the only use i found for it was for a fill flash when i was shooting out doors. I recommend the light sphere or the whale tail more expensive but amazing
3,Lo apropiado,"El producto reune las caracteristicas necesarias, lo mas importante es su propiedad difusora, misma que si se comporta adecuadamente.El acabado no es lo último de la moda, pero se acepta.."
1,Fits too loosely,"I'm going to have to give this a 1-star. I just received it and haven't taken a single photo yet. But I can already tell I'm going to have a frustrating time with it falling off of my 430EX-II. Judging from other reviews, I would have to say that sto-fen has a problem with their manufacturing; some fit well, others not. This diffuser sits so loosely that it falls off when I tilt the flash down. Think I should return this..."
5,WOW!!,"I never finished the laundry....the dishes are in the sink. At three am, I just finished. I couldn't put it down from the first page--it grabs you and runs! Gripping fiction combined with fastidious attention to the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy. Just one thing: there had better be another one coming out soon, or I will have to hunt the author down and squeeze one out of him! Fantastic!"
4,Provocative Challenging and Entertaining,"In The Rapture Dialogues, Terry James added a provocative and challenging twist to the subject of UFO phenomenon. This book is both fictionally entertaining and scripturally accurate. I will definitely be reading the sequel.Redemption: Bible Prophecy SimplifiedWoman Submit! Christians & Domestic Violence"
4,handy dandy,"This was bought on a whim and has become the most used tool in my team. Four of us work on a small aircraft in tight places. This tool gets passed from man to man. With a couple of adapters, such as apex to 1/4"" socket; it does nearly everything we need."
2,An interesting subject made boring,"For history majors, definitely not for entertainment. The book should have some interesting characters. Read about 1/4 of the book."
2,"Not for me! Cute, but a lot of blank space.","I have to agree with other two-star reviewers. While a great concept, it's so rigid! I rarely use it, and I suppose I should catch up, I missed filling out the entire second trimester, I was so uninspired. PLUS, having photos from week one is just asking for empty space! (hello, you're not pregnant at week 1!) Like many others, I don't have a lot of interesting cravings etc so the questions haven't really suited me. Oh well. It's cute!"
3,Just okay,"I received this book with my first pregnancy. I found it to not have enough lines to write in. It was a little too cutesy for my liking, but some people might like it. It was also pretty simple, which some people might also like."
2,Cute idea but poor execution,"I bought this because I thought the idea of tracking belly photos was cute. But this book is bizarre -- it actually has spaces where you're supposed to put belly pics from Week 1 to Week 39. Um, weeks 1-4 are before most people know they're pregnant. Was I supposed to start taking pictures of my belly when I got my last period, just in case I got pregnant that cycle? It makes no sense. Also, since most women aren't showing at all until much later, it's just strange and you end up with a lot of blank pages. I also didn't like that the format of it was so rigid and some of the questions it asks were just dumb and pointless. I never bothered starting it and I'll be donating it the next time I take donation books to the library. Maybe someone else won't mind these problems."
1,Not accurate,"It worked great for my first pregnancy, but now that I know more, it is totally inaccurate!! First of all, there is room to put pictures for the first two weeks when one isn't even pregnant in the first two weeks! The trimesters are also off...I believe it says the third trimester starts at week 25, which is not the case!! There are also typos...how did this book get into print!"
3,okay buy - not enough space,"While the sections and prompts are great, it does not seem to provide much room to write your response. the book itself is a good size but the pages are tiny (particularly the pages devoted for the first trimester). I am giving this as a gift. I did a lot of research and ended up deciding on this one. maybe I am just too picky!"
4,"Great keepsake, but get it on Day 1 of pregnancy","This book is very cute, fun to fill out, and well thought out. It allows you to detail you pregnancy from conception to birth, which is great, IF you get the book as soon as you find out you're expecting. I got this book when I was well into the second trimester of my first pregnancy, so majority of it was left blank since I didn't have belly pictures for most of the first 2 trimesters, and I couldn't remember anything about how I was feeling or what I was craving (etc etc) because of pregnancy brain. I really enjoyed filling out what I could, however, and will order it as soon as my second child is on the way so I can have a more complete book for Baby #2. It is a very adorable, detailed, and complete keepsake that you and your little one will enjoy reading together later. Just make sure you order it ASAP into a pregnancy!"
4,Belly Book is Great,"I was nervous about purchasing this book because this is my second baby. I thought it might be too ""firsttimer"" , but it wasn't! Apart from the shower page (which due to the spiral binding inside, you can just tear out) the rest of the book is very second + baby friendly.The only downside is that there are SO many spots for pictures. For example, week 1. Who even knows they're prgenant? Luckily we take a lot of pictures in my family so I have a little something for each page.All in all this is a great book! Funny with lots of room to journal."
5,The best pregnancy memoir!,"All of my friends are insanely jealous that I have this book and have kept it so nicely filled out. I can look back and see what weeks I felt sick, when I ""popped"" how much weight I gained etc. It will be great for comparing notes when I have another baby. The book is really easy to fill out, and has great prompts to help you out if you are stuck. Its not a mushy emotional book, but I suppose if you wanted to you could turn it into one! I highly recommend this to any mom-to-be."
4,The lazy person's scrap book,"Everyone's experience during pregnancy is different, I find it hard to customize it if you dont fit the cookie cut!"
5,Love this book!!!,"I love this book! I will buy this book for all of my pregger friends as gifts! I has lots of place's to journal, add photos, and it gives you topic ideas!"
4,Good Journal,"I had a pregnancy journal for my first baby and decided to do one for my second as well. As any pre-printed, fill-in-the-blank journal will be, there might be quite a few areas that don't apply to every individual. I just found ways to make them my own. It is a nice keepsake to hand down to your child or to look back on during future pregnancies."
2,can do better with I pod or creative zen m,"Do not waste money on this gadget.Screen size is only 1.8 inches and resolution 160x128.You can do better with I Pod video 30G or Creative Zen M which have 2.5 inch screens and QVGA(320x240)screen resolutions and cost only 15-20 dollars more ,also I Pod has dozens of addon's available everywhere."
4,"Good Player, No Proprietary DRM/Software required","Ok, I bought this cuz:I didn't need to use any proprietary software with itIt handled FLAC and OGG filesIt had a decent sized hard drive.And theoretically it'll act as a USB host for cameras as well.it sounds good, the controls are decent but if you've got alot of music files finding them with that joynib is a pain, but it didn't play my OGG files. :PStill and all it's nice and I like it."
3,Wishful Thinking,"Currently, this DVD can only receive 3 stars from me because I haven't yet viewed all of the material presented. From the clips I've seen, though, it appears to be quality material from two groups (TVU & Kids In The Way) who constantly produce nothing less. Unfortunately, I do not presently have access to the money required to purchase even such a low-priced item (read: BROKE). Therefore, I am hoping to acquire this obviously great piece of merchandise through TVU/RadioU's giveaway taking place during the week of this writing. If not, I will have to wait in agony until I acquire sufficient funding. Until then, I implore all of you to purchase this DVD of which I have no doubt that it is of the same master craftsmanship and brilliant comedy as always given by these great people!"
1,Total lie,"I bought this rather than other brands because it specifically contained only ""100% distilled Witch Hazel"" with no added alcohol. But this morning when I opened it for the first time, unfortunately well past the return-by date, I smelled a strong smell of alcohol. Sure enough, when I checked the ingredients, you know what was written? ""100% all natural witch hazel, containing alcohol 14%"". Well how about that! The 86% witch hazel that's in the bottle is 100% natural. Good to know, but I don't want the stuff and it was a total lie to say on the website ingredients list that it contains only 100% witch hazel."
1,This is a nightmare,"This movie lost me in the VERY first minute because there were several swear words. Personally I don't like so much swearing in movies, especially Christmas stories. It is most definitely NOT a family movie, for this reason and many more reasons, too many to name. Terrible acting and ridiculous sex scenes push this stinker over the top. Definitely skip this one if you are looking for a nice Christmas movie. I wish I could give this stupid movie ZERO stars."
4,"A gem, if unpolished...","Tim Pratt is clearly a gifted writer and LITTLE GODS, a collection of his short work (possibly the larger proportion of it), is a lovely read, with some delicate, poignant, and otherwise beautifully crafted stories.Somewhere between de Lint and Zelazny on the ""contemporary fantasy"" scale, most of these stories are set in familiar, realistic settings, drawing on interesting themes. Particularly notable is his sense for wistful, somewhat shy protagonists: he does ""pained"" well.The book is uneven, with some stories bordering on juvenalia or ""learning experiences"" (good for the author, but not so much for the reader), but what is good is very very good. Reading the author's end notes was actually helpful to me in finding the stories that were good (and avoiding those that didn't work as well for me).I'm not usually drawn to books of the ilk of STRANGE ADVENTURES OF RANGER GIRL (his latest), but on the strength of (the better parts of) this volume I think I'll check it out."
1,8 months later - still waiting,"I ordered this magazine in December 2002. Eight months later, i am still waiting for the first issue. Lots of excuses... no magazine. Can't say as i would recommmend it at this point."
2,"Interesting, but not for kids","This book is for adults who would like to see Middle Age art. The pictures remind me of stain glass pictures I saw in European Cathedrals, but have even more fine details. You would need a magnifying glass, skill, and an fantastic amount of time to color the book. Moses has horns, women are topless, the ancient text in pictures is not legible by children. The last picture includes a scene from an apocryphal book (Bel and the Dragon). I rate it low because it is not advertised clearly and thus may pull in those looking for a children's Sunday School book."
5,"Hard Hat with Mega Ratchet, Pink",This item arrived as advertised. It appears to be a quality product. This item was bought as a gift. I have not personally used it.
3,The plane is not 100% die cast,"Good play set for the price, but the plane is not all die-cast. The topside of the fuselage may be die-cast, but the wings are plastic. My son already accidentally stepped on the plane and broke a rear wing. Also, the wheels are not that realistic. Besides the problems with the plane, my son likes the airport bus, the luggage van (that moves up and down), and the runway signs."
4,4.5 stars!,"I would have to rate Karjan's set fractionally below his DG remakes from the 70's - which were his finest statements on these symphonies. Sound quality issues isn't the problem. The 1964 Pathetique is quite warm and lush, compared to the slightly earlier 5th (which musically doesn't quite match his later accounts). The 1967 4th symphony is just simply wonderful. The bass is a little dry as compared to his 1977 recording, but it is a little cleaner too. It is extremely intense and moving, nontheless. Certainly among the finest 4ths around.Stay away from Karajan's early 70's Tchaikovsky 4,5,& 6 versions on EMI. Sound is just not quite right and the playing seems sub-par. One can tell that his heart is just not into those versions."
5,Torture Neverending,"If you cannot fathom that God would punish most (or even one) of his creatures for year upon year upon year and, after that time, he has not really begun with his revenge, then this book may go a long way toward bringing you faith in God's lovingness. If you have no problem with such a God, good luck!"
2,And over and over and over...,"This is a book where a simple story of a love triangle is made more interesting by allowing the reader to view it from the perspectives of everyone involved (or everyone even remotely associated with the main three characters). However, the book seems to lack momentum may be because the unfolding of events is delayed when characters take their turns to talk about them."
1,Battery defective.,"The battery was defective. It was swollen, barely fitting in the charger. It did not fit in the camera. Lights in the charger went green then red then off. I confirmed it was the right battery for the camera."
3,Conflicted,"Liz Greene is a fabulous scholar and writer of astrology. This book is incredibly rich. I'm glad to have it. But I am appalled by the dozens of egregious errors (perhaps more) throughout this Kindle version, even occasionally skewing meaning, that crop up. Put it this way -- I have not read a book on the Kindle that remotely approaches the number of egregious errors found in this book. Then to place a $19.22 price tag on it! Really makes me wonder about scholarship -- about caring for the reader. I must admit to being disillusioned -- an unpleasant, typically Neptunian effect, I suppose. At any rate, if this book is re-edited (and it most certainly should be), I would love (and re-read) a more accurate copy. I am 36% of the way through the book and will provisionally rate it 5 for content and -1 for delivery."
5,Fantastic,This system kicks. On a medium setting the sound woke my newborn son 3 rooms away and the neighbors have called the police for disturbance. I regret nothing!Although the previous scenario is completely fictitious I purchased these speakers on the reviews posted here and they ARE a great system to complement a home desktop system. Great package for the low price.
2,Wiring glitch in volume control dial,"The speakers sound fine in my office. The problem is that any substantial vibration on the desk turns the sound off. There's a problem in the volume dial, which I discovered when it was too late to return the system. It's very annoying to have to tap the dial to restore volume. Additionally, sometimes the volume cuts out and the on/off feature of the volume control dial doesnt work at all, so the computer has to be shut down completely and turned on again. That's an odd problem -- sometimes you can't turn the power to volume on, and sometimes you can't turn it off. Must be a wiring or soldering problem. In any case, I'm pretty disappointed with the purchase for these reasons, and wish I were one of the many people who had no complaints."
3,Actual List Price is $129.95,How Amazon came up with a list price of $183.50 is beyond me. The Altec Lansing website shows a Manufacture's Suggested Retail Price of $129.95Obviously someone is trying to dupe it's customers.
2,$49 worth of sound,"This is not a particularly great sounding set of speakers, but, hey, you don't get great sound for $49 (guess I caught them on sale). The intended use was to supplement the built-in speakers on my TV. One of the satellites developed an annoying rattle after being in use for a short while, so I discontinued using them, but am still using the subwoofer. The subwoofer adds a lot - a LOT - to the movie viewing experience. If you don't want to invest the money, or the space, for a regular surround sound setup, this is a good low-budget method to upgrade."
3,ok for a day,This costume was cute but is made of felt...which didn't lay nicely and was a little shortin th back. I wore leggings and it turned out ok. Cute costume if your only going to wear once or twice...more would be uncomfortable.
2,eh.......,I was gonna buy this book when it 1st came out but never got the chance. I had never seen the inside of it until recently. I was definitely not impressed. She's not a bad artist but I feel that her portraits look unfinished. They could use a lot more work to look better & more complete. I agree that it isn't exactly a beginner's book.
2,Not worth it.,The book doesn't give any ideas that even the most basic imagination could come up with. I was disappointed in the content - it wasn't even enjoyable to look at.
1,AMATEURS ONLY!!!!!!!,I was given this book by someone with the most sincere intentions...Opening it was was giddy.. i was in my car and almost crashed trying to read of new positions and take my sex life to the next level...I'm not sure what pulled the other reviews in and why they are so excited about this book because it was one HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Half this stuff is obvious... the other half is really ridiculous. I'm assuming the target audience is for women who are pretending to be a lesbian - or maybe those who want to sample it out bc their husband is interested in a 3some...for the hardcore lesbian who has had a time rolling around in teh sack - this isnt the book for you. Been there done that... its not going to take you to the next level.. at all. You're imagination is alot better than this book. Its for amateurs and belongs in a photography book. Only positive is the pictures are beautiful in an artistic kind of way. Who needs art when she is trying to get a girl sprung?
3,Holy Crap!! I can't believe I spent this much money on this!,"Why is this so expensive via amazon.com? Is it rare or something? The actual price is around 17.00 canadian. I could've bought this at McNallys for that price. Oh well lesson learned, don't just shop on Amazon.com. Maybe I'll sell it here for 100.00 bucks. Geez what a rip off. Not that the book is not good, I'm just saying it's not worth $100."
2,Poor Directions and Horrible Formatting,I was excited about this book to give me some new ideas. The directions are vague and confusing. The book itself is very small so the pictures are hard to make out and span across the the two-page layout often leaving the most important parts of the picture lost in the fold. This book could have been so much more with just a little bit of effort.
4,Book 1 of Triology,"Blowback is a good starting point for being made aware of the costs & consequences of America's ""empire-building"" strategy. It might seem a bit dated but if the other books of Johnson's triology are read in sequence, Blowback is essential to the progression of the other two books. I enjoyed reading it & certainly recommend it."
2,Completely biased!,"Not a good read unless you like bashing only Republican Presidents for ALL of the world's problems... So much for buyer's remorse, I got it with this book."
3,"Very informative, but drawn out and wordy.....","This book is very informative and the first and last chapters are worth paying for the entire thing just to read them. Not the most Pro-American book I've ever read, but will give you an interesting take on things. Very in depth and revealing. Certainly shows how our American Empire can throw our weight around when necessary - and when not. Not bad, but a bit too wordy for me. Still good though."
3,The First 20 Years or The Most Recent 20 years?,Why is the book called The First 20 Years when it's about the years 1981-2001. Maybe is should be called The Most Recent 20 years?
3,Not sold on this product,I bought one of these for my camp chef stove (which i love) and honestly i can't tell much difference in the heat dispursment. The metal is suprisingly thin and warps when it gets hot causing my pot to rock. I know this thing has a lot of positive ratings but i just don't see it. Its just ok and im glad i just bought one to try first before buying one for the second burner. As long as im using my cast iron pots its not a problem anyway. Hope this helps.
5,Great workout!,"I am 48 and in good (not great) shape. This DVD is a great combination of cardio (2 miles) and toning for the lower body. Do either one separately or both for an awesome, sweat-producing, and effective workout. Just like with a personal trainer (which I used for 5 years before I moved to the sticks!). Highly recommend!"
5,Great for cold evenings,We add 3 potatoes and cheddar cheese great comfort food and goes great with crusty bread Keep the product on the shelf
2,OK,"The material is nice, but the slipcover doesn't seem to fit our chair very well, and the color looks more greenish than beige. I will likely return. The other Sure Fit that I purchased worked out wonderfully, so I think I just picked out a bad one for us. I think they make quality products."
4,Most Excellent,"I admit it; I'm a wimp. I hate cold and mess. This scraper helps me avoid both. My hand stays both warm and dry while I get my windshield cleared. That's what I want it for, and it does a great job. There's nothing more to say."
1,Unsatisfactory Service,Pugster is a poor representative of Amazon. This item was ordered as a Christmas gift. The incorrect item was delivered. Not only did Pugster send the wrong item but they included the invoice with the price. Attempts to reconcile this mistake in a timely manner were unsuccessful. I am not sure that the correct item was ever delivered and I am much too embarrassed to ask the person and inquire about the quality of the product. The only part of the transaction that occurred immediately was posting the cost on my credit card.
1,Waste of time and money!!!,"This is probably the worst book to purchase for breed specific traits in dogs. Too many breeds are lumped together characteristically. Some of the information is unfounded or simply not true. The author has done the canine world quite an injustice to make a buck. It's really sad to think some people have probably chosen the wrong breed for themselves or missed out on a wonderful breed of dog due to this book. If you want factual information on a specific breed, go to a well known registry. They have done the proper research and genetics history of each breed."
4,"Helpful for hiking, car rides","I don't really like pulling over to go because I can go alot. This product is good but also not very sturdy and no lid, you need to make sure that you keep it somewhere where it wont tip over. But I really like it for long hikes, instead of squatting down behind a bush and peeing all over myself I can just hid and stand and pee, saves a big mess. Kinda hard to get it all out of the container, takes a few tips because its shaped so wierd."
1,waste of money,"I purchased this for my wife and she said ""well I'm not going to use that!"" Needless to say, I blew it. At least it didn't cost much. Would make a good spittoon."
2,Enormous!,"The mask was extremely too large for most people I know. It would fit one of my sister's English Mastif's much better, since their heads are three times most human heads. The mask looked great but the smell was overwhelming. We had to purchase another mask that was more practical to wear throughout the party. The foam in the top of the head was a grand idea, but should have been continued into the shape of a head helment. The mask was impossible to keep on without sliding around. It would not stay in place, therefore you couldn't see out of the eyes. Think twice if you plan to purchase and wear this mask for any amount of time. It would be fine if you wore an open face helment underneath the mask. Unsatsified with this expensive purchase."
5,Iridology is amazing!!!!!,"Was able to find things that trained doctors with 8+ years of medical school could not find with all their tests! Iridology is simply amazing... its strange for people who aren't used to natural healing but trust me this method works! Find an iridologist near you, you will not regret it."
4,Good Basic Overview,"This book is a good introduction to retirement plans. It explains the pros and cons of each type of plan in plain English. This book is recommended for people who want a good background before they talk with a plan administrator, financial planner or tax professional.However, for people who want more detailed information on how each plan works, especially if you're a sole proprietor, I would suggest ""Creating Your Own Retirement Plan: A Guide to Keoghs and IRAs for the Self-Employed"" (Nolo Press, 2002) by Amy Delpo, John C. Suttle and Twila Slesnick instead."
2,archipeligo of zadar,"For some reason the dvd would not let me select English, so it ran in German, which I do not understand. The dvd is visually lovely, but I would have preferred hearing the narrative so I could know what I was looking at. I would not have purchased this item had I known I wouldn't be able to hear it in English or Croatian."
2,Deceitful Cover and Title,"First of all, I love all the one armed swordsman series with Jimmy Wang Yu but this film is both deceitful on it's cover and title, and the reason being the following: The Cover shows the old legendary One Armed Swordsman (I believe the picture is from part 2 of the series), in this movie Jimmy Wang Yu plays a one armed fighter, nothing to do with the original legendary swordsman since not even once does he uses his cutoff trademark sword or any sword at all, it's more like the chinese boxer but with an awful twist at the end. It should be renamed appropriately ""The One Armed Fighter..."" not at all what I expected this movie to be. Hence, the rating on this movie but if you are really a hard-core Jimmy Wang Yu fan and don't mind the comment, you might want to consider buying it."
5,Best Rechargable Batteries (by far) I've ever had,"I've had Rayovac Ultra rechargable batteries for 6 years (I bought 8 on sale 6 years ago), and they are still the best batteries I have. Two of the 8 stopped functioning this year, but the 6 remaining Rayovac's are the best of all the NIMH AA batteries I have (even though some of the ""new batteries were bought this year). I currently have about 20 AA Nimh batteries, and have found (the hard way) that all are not ""created equal"". As long as I can continue to get these, I'm going to buy the Rayovac Ultra's exclusivly from now on."
4,Reliable rechargeables with no problems,"I have been using this 4-pack of Rayovac for a while now and it has been very reliable. I have been charging them in 4-6 hour chargers. I have not tried these in the fast-chargers. While the newer batteries have more mah (2300+), these batteries can still be useful for non-power-hungry devices. Ideal price for a 1800mah 4-pack is $10 or less.I have used these in digital cameras, mp3/cd players, flashlights, pencil sharpeners, remote controls, etc, etc.Rechargeable NiMH AAs are a great alternative to single-use alkalines. Not only they are very cost effective, they are also more environmentally friendly."
5,works very well,"pleasant smell, and makes your aches feel much better. The size of the container makes it very affordable. Thank you"
1,Had to return it-rller ball does not work all the time,I was really looking forward to using this product so I ignored reviews that mentioned a faulty roller ball. I shouldn't have! Even trying to shake the bottle in between applications did not help-the roller ball was dry about 75% of the time. It was very frustrating to use and I am returning this product.
1,Amazon sent the wrong color,I really wanted the multi colored strap but Amazon sent a beige one. So sad! I tried to figure out how to exchange it but as far as I can tell I would have to pay even more shipping which of course doesn't seem fair.
4,Spend One Busy Night In a Dublin Hotel,"This is a sometimes touching, sometimes funny story of one night in the nouveau chic Finbar's Hotel of Dublin. You will meet a woman getting impregnated by her best friend's husband, a career woman and her crazy father, a bride-to-be who gets the ultimate revenge on an old boyfriend who did her wrong, a nun looking for love in a most unorthodox manner, a mother reunited with the son she gave up for adoption, a woman who follows her husband to find out if he's cheating on her, and an aging actress who wants to recapture the past. Their paths all cross on one night at this hotel.I chose the book because I am a big fan of Maeve Binchy and she wrote one of the chapters. Guessing which author wrote which chapter becomes a guessing game for the reader familiar with these authors.This is not as good as Binchy's own novels, but definitely enjoyable and worth your time."
4,Cute addition to Dora collection,"Despite what the previous reviewer wrote, the Dora Adventure doll does not slip off this bed because she is not made of the same slick, plastic material as the figures in the Dora dollhouse. My 3-yr-old daughter loves that Dora has her own place to sleep, right next to her bed."
2,bed looks too slippery,"Didn't buy this bed because it looks like the doll will slip off. Made of same material as the dollhouse furniture for the tiny Dora, and that stuff is too slick for the dolls to stay put. Design would be better if it were fabric or had a slight indentation for Dora, so she wouldn't fall off. I guess Dora can just be cold and sleep on top of her blanket. (!) My three year old would like that. Not."
1,A Failure of a CD,"Not being a fan of metal, I would still rate The Art of Rebellion with a full 5 stars, lush with good tunes. This is not the case with this CD, oh no. Poor 2 mins attempt at speed-punk metal, it is annoying music for 80% of this CD, you do not even feel like headbanging. A couple of good tracks save the lot (ie Institutionalized), but not worth your money. Dive towards The Art of Rebellion instead."
4,Amazing debut!,"I ended up swallowing At the Water's Edge in one entranced gulp. It's about Sri Lanka, and it's about being an alienated intellectual under conditions of late capitalism, and it's about the human predicament. Jeganathan has a deceptively unaffected style, the pitch is fine-tuned, and the story I liked best, The Train From Batticoloa, manages to convey utter menace and despair without anything ""really"" happening - I could hardly bear to read on. This is a book with an inner novel struggling to break free..."
5,Love it,"So far - having it about month or so, I love it. Like it much better than my HYLA that I have spent over $1600. Very quiet, pulls much more dirt out of carpet - so far best vacuum I have ever had .."
5,Simply awesome...,"I've never gotten excited about a vacuum cleaner before, but this one is just awesome! A friend loaned me hers, and the next day I came online to purchase one for myself. It was just that good. I now tell everybody I know about my Dyson!As for it being a reconditioned machine, I would never have known it wasn't brand new! Highly recommended!"
5,"Reconditioned, but seems like brand new","I have had this vacuum cleaner for about three weeks now. I think it's ugly, but don't care as long as it cleans. And boy does it! I didn't do the old vacuum versus Dyson test, but I did have a brand 8X12 new carpet (from local warehouse club)to test it on. I ran the Dyson over it, and filled it to the Max line on the cannister with dirt...twice. I couldn't believe it.Anyway, it also works very well on bare tile floors. I like it because it vacuums right up to the left and right edges of the attachment.Do yourself a favor. Spend five minutes reading the instructions, and practice inserting and removing the hoses and attachments.I highly recommend the Dyson, and would pay retail if I couln't find a deal on a reconditioned model."
4,Hound Dog Is Tight,"I am a huge no limit fan no limit started back in 1995 i have been a fan of no limit ever since people slept on that gambino family ghetto organized album an d slept on that full blooded memorial day album and slept on that ghetto commission wise guys raps most notorious thugs and slept on that steady mobb'n black mafia album and slept on that skull duggery these wicked streets album and that snoop dogg the game is to be sold not to be told album. With that being said i liked full blooded memorial day album he has his own rap style and he doesn't sound like anybody else he is tight lyrically. My favorite songs on the album is dog shit, foes bleed bullets,sleep no more, i'm gonna hustle, my day gon come,redrum,bad dreams & gangsta shit. I recommend this album to anybody who is a big no limit fan."
3,I don't know,"Anyone first listening to this album would say the same thing.What the f%$*!!! If u listen though, its really not a bad album. The voice he raps in is annoying but hard at the same time. I can't explain it. Besides Snoop and the Hounds, the soldier family really doesnt add any razzle dazzle to the album.Really this gets 3 1/2 stars."
2,weak & hollow.,"Sure the bass is ok, but the mids & highs are very weak. Eq'ing in itunes & winamp made a difference, but when you listen to something flat, this unit fails miserably. I've been recording sound for quite awhile now, and I must say that this unit is one of the worst I've heard out of the box. And you shouldn't have to adjust your EQ settings that much to get a decent sound.Go with something else."
2,BAD VOCALS,"I really like Audioslave and I always liked Cornell's voice. However, this is one of the absolutely WORST performances I've EVER seen either live or on DVD! The guy just can't sing!! He's struggling to produce any high note (and they're not even really HIGH) and he's constantly out of tune. I don't think I'll watch this many more times, because I simply can't stand hearing someone singing so terribly."
2,"attractive, but works poorly","I bought this toy with enthusiasm for my grandkids, ages 2 1/2 and 5 1/2, but am returning it to the store because neither of them can make it work well. As other reviewers have noted, the crank for the rollers turns so hard that they can't get a car through without submerging the toy and thereby setting the cars afloat. On the other hand, the second crank for the drier turns too easily--in both directions--so the cars get knocked every which way, again off the track. The squirter is almost impossible to fill and yields only a trickle. This toy is nice to look at but not much fun."
3,Car Wash for Tub to hard to work,Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son who at the time was obsessed with car washes. The Cranks are too hard to crank on your own while floating in the water. Therefore the toy is really only good for lining the cars up in and watching them pretend to move along the track. Not too exciting! I would not recommend this toy. In fact all Alex bath toys have been disappointing. Can't seem to find a great bath toy other than cups and tub markers!
2,Anxiety or not?,"I do not recommend this book..Other than the part where you learn to peel the onion of your problems..which you will read in any other Anxiety book..I do not recommended this book at all!Terrible..the breathing exercises to stop anxiety does not work!! Its so silly,waste of money!! I give it a D- Seriously..of course this is my opinion,but i have anxiety,so i would like to help other ppl save their money and time on another book!!"
3,Only Half the story,Seems like a great book but it is only half the book.There is a complementary book. I wish I would have realized this before I bought it
3,Recreating your self Book,I have the book Conversations with God so in comparison to that...........I'd rather read Conversations with God! It would be good for someone else.
5,Casals and his sense of Bach,"Having spent some time as a musical host on FM radio, I've been able to audition many of the Brandenburgs. Casals brings to them a feeling that cannot be described, except that it's magnificent, much like that sense that Glenn Gould imparts to his translations."
4,Good Stuff,This nailer works pretty good but at least with my 2 batteries it does not last very long. Shoots about half the nails its suppost to on a single battery. Maybe the rateing only applies if the depth is set to 1?Ether way its great not haveing to dig out the compressor and hose everytime I have trim work.It is severale times the size of a neumatic and a lot heaver.Was installing some crown a week ago and boy did it give my arm a work out.For one room jobs it works very good but for multiple rooms or a whole house the compressor gets dug out.
2,Dissapointing Mario Game,"i liked all the other mario sports games i could never get into this one though, its just always been boring... i guess im not a big golf fan lol"
4,Not the N64 Version but That's Okay!,This version is nowhere close to being as good as the N64 Mario Golf. The N64 version requires more skill. Toadstool tour is more for the casual gamer who doesn't mind the computer helping them out on occasion. Game has some New courses thats nice....
1,HORRID!,"Mario Golf could very well be the WORST game of all time! It's slow, it's repetitive, it's boring. I played this game for 7 minutes and it seemed like i keep play the same holes over and over again. The controls weren't very good, not much to this game. The graphics are what you'd expect from Gamecube, but thats about all the good things i can say about this game. If you must play, RENT it, if it's over 2 dollars to rent skip it, or i'll sell you mine dirt cheap!!I HATED THIS GAME!"
3,No game case,"I was not aware that this game would come without a gamecover/case, maybe I missed that part, I am very dissapointed!!"
5,In the words of Wario: Wonderful!,"Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour is packed with great characters, controls, environments, music, and variety. Nintendo amazes me, once again.I was wondering, does anyone here know how to unlock the 4 hidden characters? Thanks!"
3,"Fun, but a little confusing","I played a demo of this game at a local store. It was fun, but it was hard to find the hole. You are kind of just swinging and trying to look for a hole. The ball keeps soaring into mid-air and landing in the middle of nowhere. It may be easier if you played the first version on N64. I will surely rent this game and maybe even buy it eventually, I just would like to see an instruction book (for once!)."
3,It's alright,"My daughter kept asking me for a horse drawn carriage for her Ariel doll, so when I saw this - I had to get it!I was so excited to get it. The toy is quite large and it is really pretty. I love that it plays ""Under the Sea"". However, my daughter doesn't play with this as much as I thought that she would. The dolphins come off quite easily and I'm not even sure where they all are at this point. She played with the Chariot portion a few times and put Eric and Ariel in there. Other than that, the toy pretty much sits in the corner.The toy is nice - don't get me wrong. It just isn't very popular in my household."
3,Retail Accounting and Financial Control,"I found this book to be extremely helpful when I started in retail in 1990. However, when I refer to it now it is very outdated. Retail has changed a great deal in 10 years. In my opinion, this book is overpriced."
2,Snooze Fest,"It is certainly slow and methodical. I wouldn't myself consider it relaxing but rather boring. I was hoping for at least a couple more interesting tracks, not necessarily upbeat songs just a more varied sound instead of the same trance the entire CD. Mildly disapointed."
5,Great play mat,"My five-year-old son keeps many of his toys in this when it's folded up in a bin, and so far it's withstood months of abuse from him with only one small tear on the outside."
2,won't last with regular use,"My son (4) is a car/truck fanatic. We've had this mat for 2 months now, and while he LOVES it, the papery-plastic where the road layout is separating from the mat. I think it will probably be unusable in another month or two. I should have known better that such regular use needed a more durable product.the ability to fold up into a box was a big hit however, makes cleanup fun for the kids, and didn't need another place to put all the transportation toys. The layout itself is also a bit hit. This would be a great product if it wasn't so cheaply made. I don't regret buying it, because it is pretty inexpensive, but I would have sprung for something sturdier if I'd realized it would be coming apart this soon.Updated: We replaced this product for a car road rug from Ikea (Lekplats) - the same price, and it has lasted 3 years now and still going strong."
5,Very cute,My boys love this! And I love that it holds there cars after there done playing with them! Makes pick up easy
1,It started pealing after one week,I was fun for my 2yr old but only after one week the image started to peal off this play matt value should be $5 not $15 there for it sucks.
4,Fun Roadmap,"My 2year old grandson loved this for his birthday. Uses his MatchBox cars and when he's tired, he uses it to lay on...very funny to see."
4,Nautica Polo Shirt,This shirt appears to be the same exact shirt selling in stores for $65 or more. We are pleased with the purchase as well as the prompt delivery.
4,Weller Heat Gun,Very happy with the product. Excellent for detailed heating of only the wire you're working on. Nice quick heat response. Will be used for years to come. Did Tig weld 2 of the attachments to prevent them from breaking in the future. This was a suggestion from one of my co-workers who has this same heat gun.
5,Includes many insights on social norms and politics,"Rene Weiss' Yellow Cross is an in-depth, dramatic exploration of the medieval community which defied the Catholic Church and the Inquisition, the Cathars, whose religion contradicted Rome. Thirty years of the Cathars' conflicts with Rome are detailed in a history which is readable and involving. The probe includes many insights on social norms and politics of the times, as well as religious sentiments."
1,Seemed good at the beginning....,"At first it seemed great, everything worked, but soon the most used phone's buttons failed. We have since switched all the phones through - down to the last working one. Up until now I have always had great service and long use from AT&T phones. This is the last time I'll purchase one, especially seeing that others have had the same experience and ours was not an isolated incidence."
4,Good,Great product. I really like the colors they come in. they do though make the cd come out when opened harshly.
4,Nice to have these on hand,I always love to have these cases on hand. They are nice to have when burning cd's and dvd's for others.
5,Product works well,I have purchased these cases for years now and haven't had problems with any of them. The only time I broke one was because I stepped on it. :-)I am very please with them and will continue to purchase them.
4,"Well, they are cases and they are colored.","They do the job, but, as others have said about similar packaging, the first 3 or 4 discs were damaged, with broken corners. Otherwise...they are what they are."
1,Too fragile a product,I do not think packaging had anything to do with the broken cases I received. I think it is poor manufacturing and too cheap materials. I received my product in good time but cases were broken within the package. I feel this occured before shipping and is due to poor materials.
4,Eye-Catching Slim CD\DVD Cases - Recommended,"The colorful Verbatim Slim CD\DVD cases are indeed thin and will not take much abuse, but they are also eye-catching. We have an electronic version of our catalog (for my wife's small business) and take copies to give out at workshops. These cases get attention and are picked up by our potential customers.As noted above, they are lightweight and I wouldn't use these for shipping since they wouldn't likely survive in a bubble mailer but they are fine for normal storage.Recommended!CFH"
4,cit400 purchased 3/1/08 - overall good. micphone muffled,the product works very well on both landline and skype calls. easy setup. good range. no noise. only slight issue is that my voice sounds somewhat muffled at the other end. this has not been serious enough to go through a return process.
4,Skype Phone,Easy set up. Sound and call quality as good as Vonage at a much lower price. Could have better 3 way calling capabilities.
1,The phone did not work at all and was repackaged.,I am still waiting on a replacement phone. It has been over a month now and I have not received any notice.
5,"Great Product, works like a dream!","I purchased this in Jan 07 and have been very pleased. The sound quality is very good, receivers do not realize I am on a Skype phone. The headset and speaker phone work very well. One problem I did detect (which I reported to Linksys on their website) is the 100MB LAN setting seems to cause a problem making skype repeatedly disconnect during calls. I set the speed back to 10MB (which is the default anyway) and the problem went away. The handset is light and very easy to handle, battery life is good too as I can charge the handset overnight which provides sufficient charge for the day. I just need to find somewhere that sells additional handsets so that I can buy one for downstairs! I strongly recommend this product."
4,Best for voip telephony,"This is a great phone for voip, the quality is great, battery lasts long, and lot of options on the menu, the porcess to create a skype account is very easy and you can save a lot of money on international calls..."
1,Did Not WORK!!!!,I got a defective phone. The phone would not connect to the base and would not even power off... Spent one hour with Linksys tech support. Their first response was that the product would not work on a mac. After explaining to them that their own product does not need to be plugged into a computer they told me about 10 times to plug and unplug the power cord on the base....which did nothing. Stay away from this product until Rev B.
5,Great Phone,"Great Phone, easy setup, good sound quality, nice user interface - works just as advertized."
1,Expensive paper weight!,"I have this phone for almost a year now and it is a great disappointment! The phone looks good and is great when it works.For the first couple of months, it worked without any problems. Then it started disconnecting from the base.then it got worse. For the past 6 months, every time I tried to dial out, it gives out an error message ""unavailable"". I have to turn the base off and on again to reset it. That happens to every outgoing call!! Calling customer service is a waste of time and cannot find any solutions from the discussion forum. Stay away from this phone if you don't want to waste your money."
3,Sometimes doesn't take incoming calls,"I bought unlimited Skype internal and Skype In service, intended to substitute landline. Most of the time, the sound is very clear. Sometimes the communication quality is low and the other end hears echo. Recently after two month of use, I have found new problems: the phone doesn't ring when there is an incoming call. I have PC with Skype on at the same time, my PC rings but not the Skype phone. Because it doesn't ring, I cannot take calls from the phone. I thought Skype on PC interferes the Skype phone and turned the PC off. The phone still doesn't ring when I call it with my cell. Meanwhile there is no problem to call out. I had to reboot the base station and the phone to solve this problem.[...]"
5,Good Buy,"I purchased this phone about a month ago and it's GREAT! Installation was a snap and since I already had a Skype account, once I logged the phone in it immediately found my Contacts. Clarity is perfect and I like that I can choose to either use Skype or my LAN line. Highly recommend purchasing this product."
4,Great book for anyone!,"I think this book was very good! It is very easy to read and you can really connect with the characters. This book makes you happy, sad, and all emotions inbetween which really brings you into the story. This is a great book for all ages!"
5,Al Capone Does My Shirts,"I loved this book because it has a great purpose and is based around a real person, Al Capone. The story is about a boy named Moose Flanagan and his parents and his sister, Natalie. The story is about how Moose's mom is trying to cure Natalie and they live on Alcatraz island with a bunch of bad guys like Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly. Moose has crazy adventures on Alcatraz with Natalie and his friends. I recommend this book for grades 3-6.Reviewed by Andrew, age 8"
5,BOOK REVIEW FOR AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS.,"Al Capone Does My Shirts is an excellent book. It is about a kid whose moved to Alcatraz island so his dad can help pay to send their child to a special school. Moose's sister needs the special school because she is autistic. Since the day they got to the island, Moose did not like it. He made some friends on the island who got him in trouble many times. At school he became involved in a scam. The trick was to say that if you pay him he will get Al Capone to wash their clothes which takes an unexpected turn .[you'll find out when you read it.] When one afternoon Moose sees a prisoner with his sister he immediately reacts. To find out more, read the book. It is the funniest book I have read. You will really enjoy this book."
3,a good book,"I rated this book a four star out of five. This book is about a kid named Moose Flanagan who moved from Santa Monica to Alcatraz Island. He lives with his mom, dad, and sister. His sisters name is Natalie and she is autistic. There are many other people on the island; some are Moose's friends like piper and Teresa. The part that stands out most in this book is when Natalie and ""105"" are siting on the rocks. My favorite character is Natalie because she is crazy. In the beginning part of the book I didn't get it but then I started to like the book at the end of it. I would recommend this book to weird people because I probably wouldn't have read this book because it has a bad cover."
4,a good book,"This book is about a family that moved to Alcatraz for work and to seek a cure for Natalie a 15 going on 16, autistic girl who's parents have tried everything to cure her . The mother has kept Natalie 10 years old for 5 years most people know her age but her mom wants to believe that she is 10 years old because she knows that people don't pity in adults or older people like they do with children and then less likely to help. Piper is the wardens daughter and she is mischievous and sneaky she tries to scam people for money. Moose is the sister of Natalie and he does all he can to help her.The book pretty much there life and how there trying to get Natelie into the school she needs.The book was pretty good confusing at first but its okay.The people that should read this book are people that like suspense and mild mystery."
5,WHAT A BOOK!!!!!!!!,This is one of my favorite books in the whole world!!! This is a must read for people that like mischevious yet lovly books that will blow you away! The book is about a boy who had a great life and plenty of friends. All is well. But it just so happens that matthew has a sister that is suffuring with atism. Since he can remember they have had to move all over the country tring to make natile well. This time the school happens to be in San Frinsico and the only place thier dad ccan find a job is at Askaban. Will he make friends? Will this school finaly help his sister? Read the book to find out!
4,Great read for kids and adults!,"I read this book as part of a class on children with exceptional needs. Honestly, I thought it was going to be rather silly, but I truly enjoyed it. The characters are very well developed. The central character, a boy living on Alcatraz, will appeal to adults as well as young readers. The story is at times touching and hysterical, and captures the struggles of the early teen years perfectly. Highly recommended!"
3,"Cute, but too small","I love this backpack. It smelled terrible right out of the box and demanded to be washed, but my puppy and I definitely got a lot of wear out of this one. Puppy had no problem getting in and falling quickly to sleep. Its also good at hiding your pet in plain sight- I always got compliments on it but with further inspection, people were surprised to find a puppy in it!. But now that my silky terrier has grown from 3 pounds to 7 pounds, its just too small. I know it says its good for pets up to 16lbs, but I seriously doubt that as my dog stands 9 inches tall and 11 inches long and cant turn around in it. Would be great for a yorkie or pom or min pin. But too small for mine."
5,Prince Eric doll,The Prince Eric doll is very durable and can easily fit into the clothes for the Ken doll. My daughter has enjoyed this toy immensely. I would recommend buying this toy if you have the Ariel doll.
4,Not all the titles,"A collection of decent quality recordings. But, where is the second take of Traveling Riverside Blues? It also happens to be the best quality recording of Mr. J. in existence. Check out DOCD-5625."
5,The Complete Recordings of Robert Johnson,Very good redubbing of his original soundtracks. I particularly like including different versions of each song.
4,F-Zero GX,"This is a fun game, but it's VERY, VERY hard. I recomend this game to an F-Zero series fan or a racing games fan, but not an average gamer. If you do get this game, you can enjoy the awesome graphics, the beautiful cinematics, and the lightning fast gameplay. There is a lot of replay value with a buch of characters to unlock and buy in the race shop. If you can beat this game, you have either had lots of practice, hve lightning fast reflexes, or a F-Zero addict."
4,Falcon PAWNCH!!!,"This game is a great title for anyone who likes the F-Zero franchise, or racing games in general! Some may find the difficulty factor on the hard side, and there are many, MANY items to unlock. One can also sort of customize his vehicles in a ""garage mode,"" similar to the Armored Core games on the Playstation consoles (though not to such an extent as that game.) The arcade edition ""F-Zero AX"" tracks and items are obtainable in this game too, after beating the Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald Cup brackets playable through the Grand Prix mode. Story Mode follows the well-known mascot Captain Falcon and allows further points and unlockable movie scenes. In short, it's fast, hard, and a wild ride! Only playing this at home will save you quarters in the long run. I'd recommend it."
5,Well worth it,"These stands are well worth the price I paid for them. First of all they are extremely sturdy. You don't have to worry about people potentially knocking them over as the base is quite heavy and has a very wide footprint. At this price, they are twice as sturdy as my previous stands which were rather expensive."
2,JUST DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME - TRITE WRITING AND PLOT,"Sorry. This book just didn't do it for me. I like to read well-written 'chick lit' (no, that is not a contradiction in terms) that has a healthy storyline, a good grasp of quilting words fluidly together and provides rich wit without being nasty or overly snide. This book borders on being both mean and too precious at the same time. Gave up reading it about 1/3 of the way through. I was expecting more from this author considering her numerous positive reviews. Oh well."
3,Just fair,"This was my first time reading a Valerie Frankel book. I see her books all the time on the counters at the book store and figured she must be a very good author. This book just barely held my attention and I couldn't wait to finish it. I own one or two other Frankel books and will read them and give her another chance, however if they are similar to this book, I won't be buying any more."
3,I am coming out with a different book on the WSE in October,"This book is incorrectly titled and described - the book about .NET My Services has been cancelled due to the project's cancellation. I am coming out with a book in roughly October of 2003 entitled ""Understanding Web Services Specifications and the WSE"" that will introduce readers to Microsoft's WSE kit and show you how to use it with your web services. It will also cover each major WS-standard and how they can be used, including WS-Security, WS-Transactions, WS-Policy, WS-Trust, and others. It'll be fun. So keep your eyes out for the correct listing on Amazon.com, hopefully soon!"
3,The Big Dripper,A dripper is something that is a must have if you own a chameleon most reptiles will not drink standing water so it is important that you have running water that does not collect bacteria like a waterfall.That being said the big dripper does its job. From my experience the big dripper is hard to control when you have the rubber hose connected to it so I just let it drip straight from the nossel. Another bad thing is that is cost 10 bucks for a plastic bottle with a mediocre nossel.Since the big dripper does its job and its theres not many options I would reccomend the purchase if you are not ambitious enough to make your own.
2,A (Mixed) Prada Bag,"Buyer be(somewhat)beware. Not everything you heard and liked in this movie is on the soundtrack. Tres Tres Chic and Sleep are close to making this worth the purchase, but missing Jump and Suddenly I See; two signature songs in the movie, make it a dodgey purchase.This soundtrack does not do justice to a delicious movie, definitely a Chanel knock-off."
4,Perfect 5 IF it had one more song!!,"I absolutely loved the movie, saw it twice...the music was phenomenal as well. I bought the cd and much to my dismay the one track I was hoping that would be in there was not....which is the opening scene to the movie KT Tunstall - Suddenly I SeeStill a good soundtrack nonetheless..a good buy I'd say.Question to the pro's...I'm trying to remember the song that they played in the art gallery scene of Andrea's friends. I listened to the whole soundtrack and none of the songs seem to match the one that I'm looking for..if anyone can help me out I'd really appreaciate it!"
2,NOT EVEN HAPPY,"Okay, so this is an okay soundtrack, but it's not a good match for the movie! The movie has so much more energy and I would expect a soundtrack to match it! NOT TO MENTION (as everyone did) THAT IT""S MISSING THE BEST SONG FROM THE MOVIE!!!! C'MON NOW!"
2,Not the best...,"Unlike most albums to movies, on this one I really liked the background music.I know it seems stupid, but I was way more in love with the up-beat, funky, and fun-loving songs played in the background than most of the actual songs that were sung. I looked everywhere but no one seems to have them. I think it's a waste not to include those songs, as they were incredible, but maybe someone just wanted to put the songs on a track and not include the main sung ones.And my other complaint is that they do not include ""Jump"" by Madonna and ""Suddenly I See"", which is really stupid. Basically? The movie is awesome, I totally love it. Use your money on it instead of this crappy album. And I know some of the songs on here are good, but not the majority of them.~~~Hope this helped~~~"
4,For quick starting Biofilter,"I would give this more stars, but the thing is it worked so well initially that i never needed to use it but once (making it pretty expensive for a small application). Use as jumpstart for new tanks or full water changes (?). The Biofilter is important for clean and efficient water cycles, this keeps levels in check, and my fish seem happy."
1,Truly awful!,"This book is like Hopkin's other book, Selling for Dummies. It's totally AWFUL! The cheesey, numb-brained approach does not even remotely relate to what today's salespeople must accomplish or the host of regulations and competitive pressures under which they must perform. There are much better books by true experts (see my list). Three are Conceptual Selling by Miller and Heiman, Psychology of Call Reluctance by Dudley and Goodson, SPIN Selling by Neil Rachman. Your money would be better spent on one of these, or better yet, all three."
5,Riveting!,"It's great that a sequel came along that is just as good, if not better that its prequel. Beyond the Chocolate War is an example of this. This book is hard to put down with all its twisting plots. The book accurately portrays the thoughts and feelings of high school aged kids, and shows that no one is invincible-not even your everyday Archie Costello!"
2,Not as depressing as the first but not good,"I hated ""The Chocolate War"". I found it disturbing, depressing and the ultimate message (conform--or else) to be frightening. Cormier had no intention of making a sequel but for years he got letters asking what happened to the main characters. So--he wrote this. The protagonist in the first (Jerry Renault) has survived the brutal beating that ended the first book. However, he's beaten up AGAIN (although not as bad) and this is shown as a positive thing!!! Archie and the Vigils are up to their sick power games again and Brother Leon is still a twisted pathetic man. Also this book contains a teenage suicide which is just harrowing. It DOES end on a positive note (that's why I'm giving it two stars) but Cormier seems to enjoy going into great detail about all the humiliation and beating students endure. this book is out of print...hopefully it will remain that way."
4,"Confusing, yet satisfying",This book was kind of hard to get through because it is kind of confusing. There are so many characters. But it was good to finish. (Read it in 6 1/2 hours)
2,good reviews for bad books,"The book Beyond The Chocolate War was a book that I could not get into it. the book was long and dull it put me to sleep. Some of the parts of the book was funny, but others were bad.This book was one for the worst books I read in a long time."
3,Secret Recipe,"I would recommend Granny Torrelli Makes Soup to someone who enjoys books that deal with life, friendship and especially soup. I think that the protagonist Rosie is jealous because Bailey who is blind, gets all the attention. I thought that this book was okay because I couldn't understand some of the words. The author of this book is Sharon Creech. Another book I will probably read by this author is, Absolutely Normal Chaos.By: Taylor Colombo"
2,Awfully slow,I ordered this book from bargainbooks4u which has an awesome rating and everyone said it was fast. I waited almost a month for the book to arrive. The only thing that was good was their courteous email when I asked them what was taking so long.
4,sort of sad,The book was good. Someone would like it if they were interested in other people and helping other people. The book was about friendship adn relationships.
4,Granny Torrelli Makes Soup,"I recommend this book for people who like to read about friendship.The protagonist of this book is Rosie. She is 12 years old and wants to be just like her bestfriend Bailey. The antagonist is Rosie because she causes her own problems and causes problems with others.This book is very well written because it shows that lifelong friends don't always get along, but rosie's Granny Torrelli knows how to make things right with her soup recipes."
3,Smell good for a little while.,The aroma is excellent but the perfume fixative is weak. Good presentation. Elegant packaging and The EDT arrived on time.
5,Multiple choices in a single package,"In Search of a Childhood SongI enjoy meditating regularly and have for several years. ""The Confidence of Feeling Good"" is a refreshing addition to my collection.I especially enjoy the choices offered. It is nice to hear the voice with or without background music. At first, I preferred it with the background music. Then it occurred to me to add my own background sounds instead. I played the ocean waves on my sound machine...ahhh, perfect. It is great to be able to balance the volume of the background with the voice reciting the meditation to my own personal taste.The narrator is sure to make ideas optional thereby allowing the listener to choose their own experience. One quote from the narration is, ""Mother Earth energy I like to call it...call it what you want...or call it by no name.""I am very glad to have added this unique CD to my collection."
