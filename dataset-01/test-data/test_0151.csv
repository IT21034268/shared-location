3,Odd!,"This is an odd book about Bill Wyeth, a New York attorney who has his life turned upside down in an instant. Bill finds himself invloved in a case involving real estate, shady business deals, and the Havana Room in the rear of a New York City eatery where very odd things go on."
3,Funny Bollywood Kung Fu Movie!,"I have to admit there were times during this movie that I wanted to turn it off and give up on it, but hung in there and watched it until the end. Chandni Chowk to China is a Bollywood Kung Fu comedy. If that sounds odd, then it is correct! This film stars Akshay Kumar as a buffoonish vegetable cutter from India, who is mistaken to be the reincarnate of a fallen Chinese hero. The movie is funny in parts, and serious in parts, and has a few brief musical numbers thrown in also. Think Bollywood Karate Kid! It's 150 minutes of unpredictable laughs, with good-looking main characters played by famous Bollywood stars. Time well spent? Not really. Enjoyable silliness? Absolutely. Will we watch it again? Probably not!"
5,My secret extravagance - exposed!,"Sorry PETA, but I love 'em! After draining on a couple of paper towels, I've used them as a homemade pizza topping, in tortilla wraps (with other items), and stirred into a can of New England clam chowder to give it a smoky taste. Some brands have a bitter aftertaste, this one doesn't."
2,Boot needs a zipper,"There is only one problem with the boot, that is, it is too hard to pull on and off. Other than that I like the boot, it's comfortable and looks good. Next time I will get the one with the zipper."
5,great boots,"I was a little hesitant to order these as the only size available was 1/2 size below what I usually wear, and other reviewers had mentioned true sizing with these boots, such that you shouldn't order half a size larger or smaller, but rather your standard size. These fit great, though, and I've loved them."
5,definitely reccomend it!,Awesome product. Just the right amount of light at night and when the power went out it was easy to operate.
1,Light Sensor stopped working after 2 months. Stays on all the time..,"Nice idea and design but terrible quality control. Light sensor failed after 2 months. Bought 2 and one no longer works properly. That's a 50% failure rate. This is a real shame. I like the dual light design with the light sensor for an on/off auto night light. Unfortunately, it's just poorly made so I can't recommend this to anyone. Amazon needs to put a date sensitive moving average for its ratings to accurately capture products that start out great but then break. This is not my first Amazon purchase that has had this fate.UPDATE 12-15-2011: 100% failure rate of photocell. Night light stays on all the time on both units."
2,Mud flaps,Did not fit like promo said. Had to make brackets for the rear flaps to mount to. Were very flimsy to be a Husky.
3,6 motor message review,the massage could have been stronger to me but it still feels good. it needs a longer power cord . the heats not so great
2,"Like the actors, not my favorite story line.","I like the actors, but it's not my favorite story line. Hoped for something more uplifting. This was not. Just ok."
5,A great camera!,This is the best video camera that I have ever owned. Very versatile and stable. Has great add-ons that are widely available. Excellent Camera!
4,Excellent Aid for Understanding Old Testament Times.,"Harrison has written an excellent book for understanding the historical, political, economical, and social context of the Old Testament.With maps, illustrations, and charts, Harrison explains the times from Ancient Mesopotamia to the Period of the Maccabees.Whether for personal Bible study or sermon/Bible lesson preparation, the book is an excellent aid for better understanding Old Testament times.Read and enjoy. Recommended!"
4,great for verse memorization,This album is a little cheesy at times but is great for memorizing scripture. The verse is read at the begining of every song and the songs are simple enough for little kids to sing along (unlike the 2nd volume).
5,Great CD,"I caught these guys at the Fillmore as the opening act at a Beth Orton concert, and they were excellent. I bought the CD at the show and have been hooked on it since."
4,good college textbook purchase,This is a very interesting book that is being used as a college class text book. The book is very insightful and thought-provoking. Good purchase for a communications major in college.
3,Average,"Mickey is an average movie coming from the mind of Grisham. I don't know if the moral is good, but the plot is descent. There's nothing smart from the plot (considering it's a John Grisham plot) Mickey is a good film with pretty good acting."
2,Washed away with the first rain,"In Florida it rains every day in the summer. If the product worked at all, it did not last beyond the first rain. The solid version appeared to have no impact on the gray squirrels in my yard at all."
1,Does not work on NY Squirrels,"Tried this on my bird feeder and watched the results. Sprayed heavily on the approach to the feed, up the pole on which the feeder was suspended, on the feeder itself, on the sunflower seeds and on the suet blocks. The squirrels appeared 15 minutes later and behaved as if it was not there. Went out an reapplied a heavier layer. After 20 minutes the suet was gone. I returned this product and do not recommend."
1,Epic waste of my time and money!,"I have two trees that I am trying to keep the squirrels out of. After heavy treatment with this spray, it did not even phase them. They were still running up and down both trees. This was an epic waste of my time and money!"
1,Does Not Work on Squirrels,"I tried this repellent to keep squirrels out of my bird feeder. I sprayed this stuff all over the ground, grass, bird feeder, everywhere. It's a waste of money, DOES NOT WORK."
2,Disappointing,"This video contains some useful information, however, it is really a lecture with some promptings to look at. It is not very dynamic. In addition, the lecturer, noted only as Mr. Benner, makes some significant mistakes pronouncing the Hebrew in the examples used.Rabbi/Professor Mark Goodman"
5,CPA Review,"As a CPA-trained professional, one of my greatest managerial challenges was making the transition from a technician to a manager and a leader. I wish I had this book to guide me through that difficult process. My learning curve would have been much faster and certainly more successful. I highly recommend this book to first-time supervisors, as well as experienced managers. The concepts and lessons are intuitive, insightful and timeless. This is required reading for anyone who has responsibility for managing other individuals."
5,Practical and useful.,"Unlike a lot of other business/management books, this one contained information that was very practical and useful in my work environment. It had a number of case studies and examples that really helped put the steps into perspective. I would recommend it to anyone who has people working under them."
2,Bad picture quality,"After owning a Sony 8mm camcorder for 10 years without any problem, I thought I would get this model. BIG mistake.These other reviewers are right. The indoor quality is terrible. Much too grainy. Do yourself a favor and look around a little more. Don't buy this."
2,Very Disappointing!!,"I expected high quality video and still pictures from a digital camera! Instead I got grainy results that any cheap camera on the market could produce. In fact, my brother's $300 VHS-C camera took video far superior to this model. Some nice features include a wireless remote and the lithium batteries last a while. If you are looking for sharp pictures from a digital camcorder, look elsewhere!"
4,Turn Off Image Stabilization = Better Picture,Several of the previous reviewers complained about the poor picture quality especially indoors. I thought the same until Iturned off the elctronic stabilization. Aside from the tape ejecting on the bottom I find this camcorder to be a good value.
5,"just a re-issue of her CD ""Super Disco Hits"" (1980s)",".This CD is just a re-issue of her CD ""Super Disco Hits (Gold-Serie)"" (198 BMG 295 504).It's a compilation with her hits in a long version.If you wish to listen to all her songs (written by DIETER BOHLEN), then you must buy 3CD-BOX ""The Best Of C.C. Catch ""The Ultimate Collection"""" (18.092000 BMG 74321 75896-2) that contains 42 tracks - all the songs written by Dieter Bohlen for C.C. Catch !."
5,Just what I needed,"I had used this product for many years to touch-up the paint onGilbert American Flyer S Gauge Operating and Repair Guide (Volume 1)steam engines. When my original marker ran out of paint, I tried to find a replacement in a local store, but it was no longer carried there. Thank goodness for Amazon and their network of sellers! I got the paint marker quickly and now I'm back in ""business"" fixing more of these great trains."
1,not worth it,Tried to mix a packet of powdered drink mix with 8oz of water. Awkward to push the button and when engaged could not accomplish this light weight task. I threw it in the trash. Bummer.
4,Like it,"I like my morning coffee with 'frothed' low-fat milk, with a dash of Nestle's French Vanilla Coffee-Mate.This product does it quite well for me. Trudeau recommends frothing the milk while its cold, and I am not doing it. Hope the plastic end piece lasts on the hot milk I use now. But, what the heck, I only paid ten dollars for this at Amazon.com."
3,Not enough instruction,"Mostly you see the woman doing her Tai Chi, you don't receive much instruction. It is hard to see her feet while she is standing in the grass and in front of mirrors that cut her reflection off just below the knees."
5,A Priceless Gem!,"The art of North Indian Classical Tabla drumming is seldom presented on recordings in the context of a full length, traditionally structured solo performance. This CD, recorded live in an intimate setting, gives the listener a front row center seat for a performance by one of the most legendary Tabla maestros of the twentieth century, Ustad Ahmedjan Thirakwa. All of the excitement and beauty of the recital can be heard here- the appreciative sounds of the audience, the comments by the maestro, and, above all, the phenomenal Tabla playing. Absolutely required listening for those with an interest in Indian Music, drumming, rhythm; and anyone with an adventurous ear! Many thanks to Simla House for this musical treasure."
2,Was not impressed,"I needed a basic set of speakers for my office, and a portable set like this looked like a good choice. The reviews were very favorable as well, however I was no impressed. They are okay for low sound, however they cannot even achieve a moderately loud volume. They felt very cheap, and of course standard adapters will not work. I ended up selling them back through Amazon and took the loss. Hopefully their new owner will find them more useful."
4,Sun Tzu book review,"great book, and anyone in business should avail themselves of Sun Tzu philosophies. Having said that, this is another compilation and view from the original digests of his military philosophies, but put into business context."
2,Beware Kindle Users,"I bought this book for my son to read on his new Kindle he received for Christmas. Unfortunately the book is a direct copy of the printed book, and the pages are simply unreadable on the Kindle's small screen. Since each page is a ""scanned page"", the text size setting had no effect. Finding no way to zoom in on the page, I returned this book for a refund. If the publisher is reading this, please make sure books like this are in a proper format for the Kindle."
1,Very Disappointed.,I bought this for my kindle. It is not the actual stories but a magazine type thing. I needed the stories for class and could not use this after I paid for it. Do not buy this. It has extremely poor quality.
5,Best of the Best,"I spend a lot of time watching nature shows, especially National Geographic. Jewels of the Rift is one of my favorites. The musical score and narration are unsurpassed. My students are fascinated by it and just love the cichlids. We've watched over and over and over again. Just fascinating!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I would have really enjoyed the video, if half way through the video the sound went off and all I got was a humming noise the rest of the cd. I was disappointed but I didn' won't to mess with returning it. I did enjoy the first half, was a very good exercise and meditating video. Sorry"
3,Interesting book,"I read this book in a high school history class and it was fascinating, a topic that I don't think about but was totally interested by. However, at times it got kind of dull and redundant. I had problems staying awake, though I never actually fell asleep. One of my friends also read this book and tells me that she fell asleep while reading, though it is interesting. It's a good topic, not one that is usually considered, but it was not written in a very exciting manner, but still interesting. There are pictures on the inside covers of the hardcover version. This book asks and answers some very good questions. Really, why are our cities like that? There are answers in the book."
1,Lazy and banal,Anyone who's ever given half a thought to the influences which shaped American cities could have written this book. Rybczynski only brings a pedantic specificity and inane pseudo-historical perspective. It all really falls apart when he trots out de Toqueville. Don't bother reading it. And for God's sake don't waste your money on buying a copy.
2,Just one glaring omission.,How does one write a book on city planning and not include a single illustation?
1,DISGUISED!,"The authre does not know the basics of OOP. The author does not know THE JAVA LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION. The example programs are typical codes written by a VB programmer, and full of garbages."
3,no more insights,"The book does not provide any more insights than GoF's book. It is ok to see a different implementation (java version) of the patterns in the GoF's book, and how a few patterns were applied in JFC design, if that is all you want. Be prepared to have a hard time reading if you are NOT familiar with the patterns in GoF's book (!So you have to read GoF book anyways!). I just browsed the free on-line version in case I miss out something, and it seems that I don't have to worry about it since the author just followed the exactly the steps of GoF.BTW, you defintely do not need this book as a companion book for GoF's book if you know both C++ and java. And for those who are crying out to get the java design patterns, my guess is they do not know C++(and SmallTalk) so that they could not get much out of the examples in GoF's book."
2,"No ""oh Eureka"" moments","I love design-patterns. They make the difference between a good programmer and a first-class programmer (if, of course, you're using them correctly).I might learned something new but can't say I had an ""oh eureka"" moments. The examples are so-so and often boring.Dror Guzman"
1,Disgusting,"Drop it. The moment you pick up that catchy title - drop it. Don't want to know who's fault is it, author's or editor's, but it's a collection of typos upon typos upon typos, where code doesn't match text and neither match pics.Can go on and on and on ( as typos do). But rather not.This point of view is purely subjective."
2,Don't BUY the Record,"I WILL MENTION THAT I BOUGHT THE VINYL VERSION OF THIS RELEASE.I NOTICE THAT THE CD VERSION HAS MORE THAN TWICE THOSE SONGSON THE LP. I WILL SAY THAT THIS LIVE RECORDING IS ANYTHING BUT GOOD. IT'S ACTUALLY TERRIBLE. THE WRITING CAPTIONS ON THE BACK STATE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SONGS'PRESENTED ON THE LP(ON THERELEASE)ARE BETTER SONG VERSIONS, THAN THOSE SONGS DONE IN OF THE STUDIO. I TAKE THIS STATEMENT AS FALSE ADVERTISING. THIS RECORD IS A LOW BLOW FROM BOMP RECORDS..."
4,"This CD is pretty good, but ""Ego-Trip"" was better.","The best remix on this CD is undeniably Rabbit In The Moon's remix of ""Caterpillar."" The remix morphed smoothly throughout, and had interesting beats and sound effects.Much of the cool parts of the original mixes in ""Ego Trip"" were drowned out by droning repetition like that of the ""Madness"" remix. To those out there who already have ""Ego Trip,"" this remix album is quite entertaining still. But to those who don't, this album is still second banana."
1,All pain no gain,"The insoles may or may not have been helpful to my neurophty. I have no way of knowing. The pain caused by the insoles themselves made my feet the central focus of my moments. I tried to endure, thinking I could get used to it, all to no avail. The insoles are rigid, with lots of protrusions which contain the magnets. I will I could return them but there seems to be no way."
3,Vote for Partcle Accelerators,"Kane is a master of particle physics. He is less of a master of scientific explication. Do not expect another Feynman lecture here.Furthermore, Kane seems far more interested in promoting particle accelerators than explaining supersymmetry. He omits any explanation of the Higgs process except for passing mention, and ignores supergravity.On the other hand, he makes it clear that we need to have another particle accelerator. Too bad the Texas SSC was killed."
1,Register Ribbon review,This product did not work well for us. The ribbon doesn't seem to be turning w/ each purchase. You can barely read the receipts after just changing the ribbon cartridge. I won't buy this product again.
2,Alright!,I thought this was going to be a crazy progressive rock record. Look at the cover. C'Mon! Guess I had to do some research beforehand...but the cover is so.....
4,Transition album,"""Supernature"" obviously marks the point that Cerrone was in a transition period after the succesfull Love in C Minor and Cerrone's Paradise.The title track is clearly inspired by the German synth sound from Giorgio Mororder and Pete Belotte. This album also features one of Cerrone's best (known) songs: Give Me Love. The song has since then sees many reincarnations, but I think the version on this album is the best."
2,Very cheaply made,"I got this because it most closely resembled something my daughter saw in a catalog for Christmas that sold out before I could get it. I paid way too much for what it is, as it is very cheaply made. I wish I had gotten the Melissa and Doug horse trailer. My daughter has played with this very little."
3,"As expected, flimsy but fun.","I read the previous reviews and was prepared to get a hunk of junk and I wasn't disappointed.It is very flimsy, the little door was already broken at arrival but my little one still had really good two days of playing with it.After that she lost interest and now it's sitting in the corner.So, if you buying for a older kid, they for sure get disappointed but my 4 year old was just having a blast with it."
5,Lots of ideas,"There is a little text at the front of this book but it is basically a compendium of original designs. They are broken into categories like Home & Garden, Birds, Flora & Fauna, Domestic or Woodland Animals, Under the Sea and Textures. The designs can be single motifs or actual scenes. Many can be grouped to create even more elaborate designs. Some are quite simple; others would require a fantastic eye or marking the quilt. If you have searched for something different and non-traditional to add to your quilts, this book should be in your library."
3,3.5 stars - Better than good.,"Not as much a mystery as a character study, it vacillates between multiple characters and two time periods, which I found tiring and a bit confusing. Rozen's depiction of 9/11 and its aftermath are remarkable and sad, and the characters are a reflection of that. However, I found the end very unsatisfying. Parts of the book are very well done and, as Ms. Rosen is a resident of NYC, I certainly understand its impetus. But personally, I'll admit I am anxious for the return of Bill and Lydia."
5,awwwwwww yeah,"This CD lives up to all the strange spooky hype surrounding it. It's funky and fine, trippy and tripped up. Being an old geezer of 31 and raised on classic rock, I am not familiar with Blur and/or Cibo Matto. I was drawn in by that stunning MTV clip. (Watch the channel at 7 am, they actually play music!!!) I am stoked by the weirdness the group has surrounded themselves with. And the production of the music itself is both subtle and earthshaking. As the type hype says, this is the music of the future, baby. Hop in your ship and go...."
4,Strange...,"Since I wasn't really too hot on purchasing this CD because I figured it would get really old, I borrowed it from a friend. Man, was I wrong. Some stand out tracks are definitely ""Slow Country"", a great song with a whirring opening, ""M1 A1"", with it's Twilight Zone-esque opening and it's heavier body and ""Dracula"", a great song that opens with an eerie medieval tune, and doesn't stop. The two singles that I've heard in the US ""Clint Eastwood"" and ""19-2000"" are also great, poppy and infectious.The CD did not earn it's Parental Advisory. They swear no more than a few times, albeit the ""F"" bomb almost every time. You'd hardly notice if it was edited, anyways."
2,Just Total/Pure [edit],"Horrible, The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because Clint Eastwood is really that good, but that is it. I hate this album and am still pissed off that I can't trash it beacuse of the quality of Clint Eastwood.-FM"
2,Don't be fooled by the cartoons or Clint Eastwood,"Do not be fooled like I was. When I saw the video of Clint Eastwood for the first time, I thought to myself WOW. I immediately picked up the record, and was very disappointed to say the least. I read a few online reviews of this record earlier (some good, many bad) and then decided to buy it. If for nothing else than the song Clint Eastwood.Well, I put it into my player and started to play the first few tracks. Hmmm, OK, let's skip one, another one...wait where is Clint Eastwood. Ah, finally, Track 5, Clint Eastwood. Good song, after that...let's skip this one too, not my music. At the end of Track 11 I think to myself ""What the hell?"" This is getting worse by the minute...I don't know, some people might like rap-funk hybrids like this. It is not me.Go listen to the entire record before you purchase. Then you will decide whether it is worth it. My copy is on eBay however. Ohhh, 2 stars were given for the cartoon characters. They are damn cool...True."
4,"i'm feelin' glad, i've got sunshine in a bag","this cd is AWESOME!!! its been in my cd player for two days straight (i only got the cd yesterday). i first heard about the gorillaz when i saw the video for ""clint eastwood"" on MTV and we all (my family) thought it was really kewl. i LUVED the cd and im what would be considered by most to be a ""teenybopper"". my dad also luved the cd and he listens to classic rock (the same stuff he listened to in college, such as the strawbs, journey, the eagles...ask your parents). i reccomend this cd to anyone who has eclectic music tastes."
4,ROCK THE FRICKIN HOUSE!,"When I first saw this band I thought it was just a joke since the musicians (2D, Murdoc, Noodle, and Russel) are cartoons. NORMALLY, I don even like rap or hip-hop at all but when I heard the rapping vocals on tracks like ""Clint Eastwood"" and ""Rock the House"", I enjoyed it thoroughly. My favorite song on this CD has to be ""Rock The House."" Since I like ska music, I loved the horn line in this funk/hip-hop song. The lyrics are also funny. A song that I'll give the Gorillaz credit for uniqueness is ""Re-Hash."" The chorus is prety catchy."
5,kickin' album,"I have to agree with ""mikah tequila"" (another reviewer) -- if it weren't for mtv (which I have now watched all of once) and the fact that the cartoon video caught my eye, I never would have heard of the gorillaz, and I am very glad that I have. This album kicks and has something for everyone. It combines rock, rap, hip-hop, reggae and everything in between. Buy it now, and happy listening (and, as is the case, happy website viewing). :)"
2,"funny, ugly and tornillo.","inspired for children? or created for destroy MASSES? .......listen this record,SUPERTOYS...or something!"
2,Didn't think it was going to be that weird,"All I can say is weird. Aside from Clint Eastwood and maybe Rock the House, there is just a lot of tracks with people saying things you can't understand. I warn you, I'm not saying that I totally hate this cd. I just believe you have to be in one of those weird moods to listen to it in its entirety."
2,Bleh,"I tried really hard to like it, but it's just simply, not good. If you ask me, it sounds like it' trying way too hard. Too hard to be important, different, or art for art's sake. It's chockful of boring trip-hop throwbacks, watered-down rock, awful rap, to stuff like 5/4, which is actually not that bad. It's uneven, too long, the lyrics are nonexistent, it's boring, it's just a waste of time. The only reason it's popular is because they make cool videos/it's rap/people are easily led to believe if they're buying something cool, they're nonconformists. I usually end reviews like this with something like, ""if you want good trip-hop, go get ---"" but I can't think of one. Bleh. Keep the emo/punk/rock alive. Go buy a Get Up Kids album and experience a little emotion and creativity in your music. I'm out."
1,S Club 7 + Vanilla Ice = The Gorillaz,"Albums don't get worse or more formulaic than this, folks. Clint Eastwood is the worst hit song of any genre over the last two years, and this album doesn't sound anything like Clint Eastwood - it sounds even worse. The cartoon characters desperately grasp for anything interesting to say 'n' play, but this all stuff you have heard before. Junior high school couples compose more interesting poetry to one another, and the talented scratchers and musicians on this album mail in their roles. There are no words to explain how cloying and dumb this disaster of a CD is. I will never buy another Blur album in protest of this Gorillaz insult. I like Blur; however, I hate Gorillaz passionately and look forward to waking up in the morning safe in the knowledge no followup album is forthcoming to further waste precious MTV and radio time."
1,Apocalypse would be a good title,"Yes, i'm serious, this album is the worst album i ever saw someone buy illegal. I hate this one, and Clint Eastwood is the worst of them all. I ain'talking the videoclip, but this ain't music"
2,eh,the only song that is good on here is clint eastwood. i'm very mad at the moron who decided to remix such a good song. u suck person.
4,"I""ve had a change of heart regarding this one...","The last time I tried to edit this review, Amazon wouldn't let me, why have the edit function then??????I initially bought this when it came out based on the strength of the track 'Tomorrow Comes Today'. And upon further listens, I wasn't very moved at all, in any particular way or another. So I wrote a review, frustrated, and trashed it. Blaming Damon Albarn (who's taken me ten years to finally appreciate) for the most part. Months later, I put the disc in and suddenly I get it. And then I went and got Blur's best of collection. The Bottom line is that this is a very fun and very layered disc, you might not hear everything the first few times but it'll creep up on you."
2,Cd gets old,"""Clint Eastwood"" is a good song, but take it from me: Don't listen to it too much or else you will hate it. There are one or two other good songs, but they also get old. This Cd isn't great. The band is cool and ""Clint Eastwood"" is worth having on a mix, but I would advise not to buy this CD"
4,"Gorillaz, the new fad is coming!","Well what can I say? The first time I saw Gorillaz, was on MTV Late Night. Up at 3 A.M. watching an animated music video (""Clint Eastwood"") with funky cartoon characters, and a catchy refrain, I definately had a yearning to learn more about this group.Going online, I expected to find them a normal band, likr Korn or whatnot, that produced a few animated videos. Instead I find an interesting look into what could be an absolute gold mine.Gorillaz are animated. Not sometimes, but all the time. Their record was produced by the frontman of the group ""Blur"" and there are about 20 names credited on the back of their album. However, nowhere is there a place that puts any names credited, with a face in the group.Gorillaz have yet to achieve massive radio play in the U.S., with only one radio station in my hometown occasionally playing ""Clint Eastwood"". So if you havent heard them yet, check them out. I guarantee you its worth the time!"
5,Just great,"Usually 'mtv' music hurts my ears and my brain but I have to say I find both this and Demon Days to be really great stuff.I've listened to both CDs about more times than I can count would have to call this one my favorite. Its just a little edgier, a litte more upbeat, and a little more fun. Either way, both are great and for 10 bucks you really cant go wrong here."
1,One hit wonderz,"The single Clint Eastwood is maybe the best single this year in my opinion, where it had a nice blend of rock, rap and a little techno. I was so excited by the idea of the other songs on the Gorillaz album being similair to it I bought it. Boy was I in for a shock when every track except Clint Eastwood was background music mindless techno, with nothing clever or exciting in there to captivate my interest. So before I leave just imagine standing in an elevator for a few hours, hooting and hollering to the elevator music. Know where you are? At a Gorillaz concert."
4,Not a light reading,"This TPB is only Preacher worth byuing. Preacher was published as 66 issue complete story. I read all of them, but first five issues are the best although they are just the beginning.God leaves his duties, priest gets beaten for exposing everyone's secrets from confessions, and something out of paradise posesses him...few days after, he meets his ex girlfriend turned hitman and gets acquainted with a strange Irish guy.Second story arc with serial killer is , well, deja vu for horror fans."
5,A Great Start,"The book marks a great start to a long journey. Spanning 60 some issues, Garth Ennis' Preacher is a landmark graphic novel series that pokes fun at Christianity at the same time it's dissassembling it.It's well worth the time and money put into it, and to be honest it's one of few graphic novel series I find to be totally worth the money invested into it."
2,Dissapointing,"That sums it up pretty well. After VOD's debut album, I expected another awesome hardcore CD. Instead, IMPRINT gave me mediocore metal. Tim just doesn't sound like he used to on the self titled album. I cant even make the connection between the Tim on Imprint and the Tim on Vision of Disorder. The guitars sound...I don't know, kind of messy. The first album had catchier riffs and smoother guitars. And the abuse of the lumpy double kick just sounds awful too me. Try VISION OF DISORDER or FOR THE BLEEDERS first. Go ahead, click 'no' below, if it will give you any kind of satisfaction. Maybe it will make you feel like more of a VOD fan. I'm sorry, but I just don't like this album."
1,AWEFULL,"There's really nothing else to say about this albumn. It's boring, tired, dried out heavy metal. This isn't hardcore. Buy the self-titled albumn, it's 1,000 times better."
5,This is the best album of all time,There is nothing more to say about this album. It is simply incredible. No other band in the world comes close to being even half as good as VOD.
5,Brutal!,"These songs are not extremely complex, but very heavy & intense! Not quite death metal( I am a big fan of Swedish death-i.e. In Flames) but very hard! Forget Pantera--they have turned into commercialized noise--this is great and I hope these guys keep up the intensity--regardless if they slow down or speed up--just keep the aggression! You can not really fall asleep to these tunes!"
4,Good Biblical Fpundation,The forte of this writing was the abundant amount of scripture offered by the author. It was also a good wake up call for getting right with God and letting the results and benefits come as a result of seeking God and not the approval of others. It does not minimize ones struggle with weight but points out it may be a symptom of our need to address our relationship to God first as well as God's will for our use of food.
5,Soft after 2 washes,It was soft after two washes. I love it and my son (hes' 2) loves it so much that he won't let me take it off his bed. I'm buying 2 more of these exact sheets so he'll let me change his bed.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a disappointment!!! There is not one original thought or sentance in this book - it's full of often-heard quotes from meetings and was a total waste of [...]. DO NOT spend your money on this one - just go to a meeting and you'll hear more than half the book. Go to a second meeting and there's the rest of the book. I won't even give this book away.
1,"Ok, but not for this price","I bought the black one for under $40, and after having it now for just under a year, I would not purchase another one.Cons: 1. When I push the earpiece into my ear, I end up clicking the activation key, which will either disconnect my call, or expects me to voice dial.2. After I have used it for a couple of weeks, it slides out of my ear way too easily. And don't let the over-the-ear hook fool you either - it's not all that!3. The earpiece that goes in the ear is a little too big and I have normal size ears.4. It does not have all the bells and whistles you would expect to get for the price of this unit.Pros: It has the sound quality you would expect from Nokia.Given the Cons and Pros, I would not purchase this unit again nor recommend it to anyone. It's more of a pain in the butt."
5,LOL,"Everyone who sees my 2 yr old daughter with this thinks it's cute and funny. My daughter even looks in the mirror and laughs. She loves it n so do i, perfect fit for her. The pacifier is not heavy at all."
3,ghostly eyes,Product was good but very disappointed in the quantity for the price. The quantity was not listed in the product discription.
4,The fascinating story of a fascinating musician,"Complete with interviews with family and fellow musicians, plus musical examples, this is the story of of a musician the likes of which we may never see or hear the likes of again."
4,Disorganized Crime,"See six city guys,two cops and four bank robbers,survive their misadventures in rural Montana.Hilarious from beginning to end."
4,Grease for mask,Applied to our masks before we went to Kauai and it worked well. I'll apply some more now that we are back so that it will protect our masks.
2,Obviously used,"The product is as expected. However, when I received it, it had obviously been previously used by someone. Not only was there no tamper-proof seal (I am not sure whether the manufacturer put one on there) but someone had obviously taken some of the grease out with a comb-style object."
1,totally unoriginal and unexciting,"I absolutely couldn't wait to hear this CD, but I have to be honest: I was more than just unimpressed -- I was really crestfallen after hearing how ""cliched"" both guitarists have become. Here is what I would suggest to anyone: compare Larry's version of 'All Blues' on ""Last Night"" to the one on ""live in Osaka"". My opinion is that they all throw in the towel and sell their souls when they convert to the GRP religion.Larry says in the credits that this album was all about ""checking our egos at the door"" - A more accurate statement would be that they checked their improvisational flair and creativity at the door."
2,Console yourself solely with the price....,"I can't imagine a worse piece of crap to unleash on the world and market it as great musicians coming together. This is no balls guitarmanship in the veins of steve vai and satch or santana but even more watered down and senseless. Somebody called this jazz but jazz always has focus and direction which this has niether. Thankfully I paid the MP3 price which is basically what it would have been worth in the bucket bin. Sadly, I can't throw my copy in the bucket and deleting it repeatedly from my playlist gives me little joy. Buy at your own risk."
5,Good value for a great product,We have used PetTabs as the vitamin supplement for our dogs for over a decade. Buying at the 365 tablet size saves money over purchasing the product from our veterinarian.
3,An O.K. Recording,"I've only heard a few Cats CDs but this is only O.K. Elaine Paige is only mediocre here (much better on the video) because here she seems to struggle to get the top notes. Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer is great though and a change from the B'way Cast (which is a better recording). I listen to this more than the B'way recording though, probably because of it's differences from any modern production."
4,CATS is always good!,"Great album for the enthusiast. However, I liked the overture from the Broadway version better. THis ""Original Cast"" album overture is too quick. Other than that Elaine Paige is awesome as always. Any true CATS fan will have to have both albums though."
2,ZOMBIE SNOOZEFEST! ONLY INTERESTING FOR NOSTAGIA!,I caught this on MGM's HD channel. The film probably looked better on this station than it ever did! This was another one of those war time films just to take people's mind off of bigger more real horrors. I know it probably gave people the best nap they had in a long time. Silly and boring with the usual white eyed stereotype frightened black guy(comic relief thank you!)running around with some very non scary zombies. Poor John Carradine!.....he deserved better than this!

3,Not bad!,"I bought this after Amazon.com put it on sale for $30.00, and considering how little I paid for it, I am quite satisfied. I find it most useful for things like library book due date reminders and keeping up with my finances (I have very uncomplicated finances). On the downside, The backlit display doesn't stay on more than a few seconds and the handwriting feature is too difficult for me to maaster, especially when tapping the messages in on the screen's ""keyboard"" is so easy."
1,Worst product. Dont ever Buy it,It never worked for me with the battery.so returned it next day itself.
3,Poor spelling throughout,"This is a good book, but it suffers greatly from poor spelling and an amateurish presentation. It looks like somebody ran off Xerox copies of type-written pages. Misspelled words are everywhere. The book is also very expensive. For the price I expected more. There is some interesting information in the book, though. 3 stars--could have and should have been 5 stars for that price."
3,"Not bad, not very good","I was looking for a straightforward, factual book about the US Constitution for my daughter. This book mostly meets that need, but I have had to point out to my daughter several things stated in the book that aren't quite accurate."
3,US Constitution and You,"This book is awesome. I have my granddaughter walking around talking about the Constitution, and she is only 8 1/2."
5,A Must for So Cal Gardners,"I have many books on caring for outdoor plants, but this book is by far the best I've ever seen! It guides you through purchasing, planting, trimming, pruning, dividing, fertilizing, pest and weed control, vegetable gardening, care of citrus trees, roses and much more. Everything is specific to the S. Calif. climate. There is a chapter devoted to each month, which goes indepth about specific plants and trees that need special attention that month. At the end of each chapter there is a checklist of ""to-dos"" for the month. With this book your time spent in the garden will produce better results, and it will help you to do things right the first time instead of learning through (costly and time-comsuming) mistakes."
4,Agnostic Front - keepin the oi alive,This CD makes me want to riot! Gaurenteed to get you pumped with songs like Gotta Go and Crucified. Required punk tunes.
4,I Love Barbra Streisand Becase She is Nice Lady,Our The Likest People in The Wold I Love Funny Lady Becase your Greatis
4,RITE LITE Wireless Picture Light,"I've just received this product, so my rating is based only on my first impression. I wanted it for vision help for cosmetic purposes. It works very well for my mirror ... seems bright enough ... I liked the flexible neck. I might note (we'll see if Amazon lets me say this): I ordered it through Walmart's ""site to store"" system: NO SHIPPING CHARGES!Joan S, Salem, Oregon"
1,Dim & Dimmer,This light is completely useless on any picture bigger than an 8x10. The light output is very dim and the coverage area is uneven. I bought two of them and immediately returned them for a refund.
2,good when it works,We bought one of these to provide light on a painting. It worked well so we bought a second for the same purpose. The second did not work at all. Hopefully if you buy this product you will get one that works.
2,Does not last long,I don't know if my batteries aren't fresh but this has not provided light for a long time. It always dies on me. I have changed the batteries twice. I will try some new batteries but next time I will invest in cordless that has to be drilled in the wall with a standard buld. The hassle with this is not worth it.
3,Works,Barely fits my picture frame. Easily knocked off. Would work well on a thinner frame. Easy assembly and good lighting thanks
2,Radar Detector,"I purchased this product to replace a Whistler I have had for 2 years. This gives many more false signals as the Whistler at a higher price. I went back to my old one and put this in a vehicle I do not drive very much. This does have a lot of programming options, but in my opinion it is not as accurate as the competition."
3,"Decent, but go with a different one, TERRIBLE RANGE!","I'm all about a good deal, so when I was looking for a good radar detector and found this one factory refurbished for $60, and saw that it had a lot of decent reviews, i went for it. I think I regret it though. My primary reason for purchase was simply as a reminder not to speed. but when I do, i would like a little protection. PROS: Looks really nice, the LCD screen is awesome and easy to read night or day, color can be changed to match your interior lighting, automatically gets quieter after the first couple beeps, and other great features. CONS: This thing has tons of false alarms, the safety alert for ambulances/etc. doesn't seem to work at all, and the worst part... TERRIBLE RANGE!!!! Doesn't go off until you are 100 yards from the cop, by then its way too late. My brothers V1 goes off about a mile ahead of time, but for $400 i guess it better!"
2,it sucks,"don`t buy it it beeps on everything , if u want to buy something pro and great get Escort X8500 , i tested them both together on the same car in highway and city , and the Escort ROCKS !pay little more for Escort and save the tickets now on !"
3,"""Good""",Bought the product in 2007. It has been helpful since then.Three months ago the display broke. Last month it stopped working. It was worth the money.
3,Works o.k......,I replaced a Beltronics unit with this because I wanted audio and liked the compass and other features advertised. Can barley see the display in daylight. I get false POP alerts.. Wish I'd just upgraded to a Bel with audio.
2,"Great Light, terrible Battery","I have the ""Husky Tuff Brite"" model, which is the same. Worked great for a year, then the battery died. Finally found a replacement at Interstate Batteries... seach for SEL CB3-6 6V 3AH. $10. Hopefully that battery will last longer than the original..."
1,Spend your money on something else,I would recommend you use your money for something else to try to lift your emotional state. I ordered this and would choose to return it if I could.
2,Not great,"This textbook is OK, but if you can find another book you should seriously consider buying it over this one. This textbook is extremely unclear and gives horrible examples. They constantly give solutions to examples along the lines of ""Consider this diagram. It should be easy for you to figure out this answer from it"" without giving any explanation or solution whatsoever, and then they move on to the next step. Seriously disorganized, buy a different textbook"
4,Pretty good VERY RELAXING STRETCH!! :),"I like this video because she does challenge you but the pace is pretty fast, sometimes it's hard to move so quickly from one thing to the next without falling over the band. I often wonder if these quickie work out DVD's that tout 10 minute work outs are lacking in effectiveness because they don't do as many reps. However, this is THE BEST 10 minute stretch she has at the end that I've ever come across. I look forward to it everytime I work out... even if I go with a different DVD for my workout, I always pop this one in at the end for the stretch."
4,10 minute solution tone trouble zones,The workout is very thorough. Lots of high energy combinations. I enjoyed it very much. The only complaint I have is that the workout sometimes moved a bit fast for a beginner.10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones
4,good workout,You will definitely feel the stretch and tone up with this workout I love that you can customize it to whatever you want.
4,Black Beauty - Remembered,"My memory is not what it used to be! I saw this when it came out in the 70's as a child. Thought it was more like the book, but that isn't totally correct. Some changes to the book, but over all in line with the original story line, and way better then the newer versions. Very kid friendly!"
3,If you love horse stories. a classic to enjoy.,"Bought this for my 6yr old granddaughter.She is watching one chapter each week.It is not always the clearest, sharpest picture,but she is enjoying it.A good value, if you love, or know someone who loves, HORSES."
1,didn't work,"I gave this watch to a 12 yr old neice, and it didn't even work right out of the package. Very frustrating!!!"
4,Better performance than original Terastation,I have owned a Buffalo Terastation 1G model for about 2 years. Operating it in RAID5 mode. It's reliable but rather slow. We encountered the Promise SmartStor while browsing the aisles at Fry's. They were running a sale on 750G SATA drives so I decided to invest in the whole thing (plus bought one extra drive in case I ever lost a drive in the array.)The drives were easy to install if you have ever built your own PC. It took a couple hours for the drive check and format routine. I was impressed with the performance-- far better than the Terastation's older IDE drives.The unit is also more compact. The only reason I would recommend the Terastation in preference is if you are UNIX-savvy and want to hack the device-- there are Wiki's chock full of hacking tips.
5,"Insightful, powerful and resonating","Being a Quinn fan, it should come as no surprise that I snapped up this book immediately. It should also come as no surprise that I loved it. Quinn's description of the world on fire brought tears to my eyes...he had had the experience I suspected I too could have. His journey is his own, and I will have my own, my reading about his journey once again reminds me of the joy of being alive, of discovering who you really are."
2,not exactly sterling,"Although I have enjoyed the anklet, the color is now ""gold-tone"" rather than silver. I received the anklet as a gift last Christmas (a year). It would not seem to be actual sterling. I don't really enjoy it as much as I once did. I am disappointed in the lasting quality."
4,nice,"It came quick. Looks good. Wife likes it. As of right now, worth what I paid for it. If she ain't complaining, I'm not either. Lol."
5,Nice chain..GREAT Price!,Anklet is very feminine and very attractive. Great little chain for the price. I wear it everyday.Thanks Gem Ave!
4,An excelent socio-economic analysis of 'New Wars',"Based on the field research on the conflicts in the Former Yugoslavia, especially those in Bosnia, Mary Kaldor offered a multifaced socio-economic analysis of organized violence in the Post-Westpharian System. She not only claimed the transformation of inter-state wars into civil wars, LICs and so on but also complex and privatized nature of 'New Wars,': the role of Military-Industrial Complex as well as underground economy, identity politics and the role of unofficial organizations such as NGO and Mafia."
2,A Pretty Face,"I had two Holiday CD's in hand, Ashanti and Whitney Houston. Thinking of a fresh new Artist, I choose Ashanti. Well, that was a mistake. The Christmas CD of Ashanti lacks flavor, soul, and flare. Most of the album sounds juvenile at best, with simple cords, no harmony and flat music. I have tried several times to give the CD a chance because I have an open mind. Well I'm done playing the CD! The Whitney CD is much better. Much Much Better!"
2,This CD Is Not Merry,"I will admit Ashanti has haters, but its clear to most people who are honest that this girl can not sing. I have tried and tried to like Ashanti, but her vocals are too weak. I suggest that she takes the direction of Britney Spears and try to hide her weak vocals with some exotic tracks and hot dance moves. The problem with Ashanti is while she is a decent songwriter, she has no star quality and these days, that means everything. I heard this cd at a friend's holiday party and most people at the party agree that their biggest wish for Ashanti is for her to get some pipes."
1,Even Ashanti Fans I know hate it!,"I got this CD as a christmas gift for a friend of mine who I know loves Ashanti. I thought she would be very pleased with the gift but she never mentioned the CD after XMas. After I read the other reviews, listened to the clips, and found out the album was only 29 minutes long I can see now why she never talked too much about this album. There is nothing to talk about. I can see this album gathering dust in my friend's CD collection, maybe she'll give it another try next XMas, but I'm guessing this album will still suck! DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM, EVEN ASHANTI FANS DON'T LIKE IT!"
4,"Slippery mat (oops, bad review)","For the money I paid, it is slippery. The ten dollar mat I still have works much better. Not sure how I can make it less slippery.>>>>>>>>So sorry about the above...I reviewed the wrong mat. I had bought two, and so got confused. This mat is heavy, thick, and stinky, but definitely not slippery. It's a very decent mat, except that it's heavy, harder to fit in a normal mat carrier, and it does have a strong smell. The smell absolutely does not bother me, but it does have a distinct smell. Great mat overall."
4,Jade yoga mat,"The Jade Harmony mat provides good grip. I feel really secure during practice, no sliding at all. I don't detect any overwhelming odor like other reviewers had described. If you get really close to the mat, yeah, it smells like rubber but it really doesn't bother me. Gave it 4 stars because I only had it for a month, will have to see how long this mat will last."
1,"STINKY Stinky, stinky!!!!!","well, As you may have guessed by the title, this mat smells AWFUL! it seems to be vey sturdy, and a nice, firm grippy material, but peee-eew, what an odor! We called the company, and they said that since this mat is made from natural latex (I think) that it would have a slight odor for a week or 2... at Over a month later, the thing still reeks!"
4,Great mat,"I love the thickness of the mat, and the color. The downside is that being a ""sticky"" mat, it collects hair and fuzz from the floor. Also, during Hot Yoga I still slipped a little and had to use a towel for stability."
1,"""chronicles""? more like ""massive omission""!","missing career defining chart smasher ""information"", obviously the best song dave or jeff were ever involved in."
2,Cooking out of a packet,"I know that Paula Deen is reveared in the USA, but for foreigners, this cookbook was very heavy on processed foods, loads of sugar, and frankly, not particularly exciting entries. Ms Deen's running narrative can be charming at times, but when I bought the book I really wanted recipes that were innovative....and these were so old fashioned, and when accompanied by her 'down home' comments, I was quite put off. Unfortunately, this will go to the local library. There was absolutely nothing in it for me."
2,Great cookbook to give to a beginner cook,"I have been a reader of cookbooks, but rarely made the effort to actually cook from them. Most all cookbooks' liberal use of exotic ingredients made it next to impossible to attempt to recreate the dishes. Not so Paula's. I have tried about 4 recipes, and have been pleased with the results. My husband has been appreciative. I think this would be a great cookbook to give as a gift to a young person just starting out, but also for the more seasoned veteran cooks too. Simple comfort foods do have a place in everyone's life.I actually purchased the two-volume set, and immediately found out she was coming out with this hardcover edition. I think the publishers could have reorganized the two books by categories instead of printing two books back to back inside the hardcovers, but at least the index is organized as one. I bought this because I prefer hardcovers. I intend to give my other set as a gift to my husband's niece for Christmas."
3,Second best of the series,"As this year's After Dark films go, this is hands down the second best of the lot. It's funny and quirky in that Friday night at the movies stoner kind of way. A bunch of teenagers stuck in a strange hospital.It is no Session 9 but it doesn't aim to be.Director Adam Gierasch still is yet to prove his worth but this movie has such an obviously low budget that I'd like to see what he could do with some more money - so long as it's not Hostel 3!!!.It's easy not in the same class as From Within but if you like this sort of movie it delivers in its own way."
3,And then there was darkness,"A historical depiction on the effects of religious fervour on people. Shantha the nanny, in a sense, seemed to represent the beauty of India. All Indians - Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Parsees, alike, revolve their lives around this divine creature. Shantha chooses her suitor because of love, not religion. Then, there was chaos. Partition. Religious riots. In a deep jealous rage, friends turn to foes."
2,"Not as good as ""Water""","I gravitated toward this movie after seeing ""Water,"" which I thought was amazing. ""Earth"" seemed to me to be, though ambitious in scope and subject, a much less accomplished film--somewhat pedantic and leaden, awkward and fragmented. The characters all too obviously stand in for aspects of the social and political landscape, whereas in ""Water,"" the characters' stories and relationships with each other, while embodying larger issues, were for me much more involving, immediate, vivid, and poignant. I think Mehta grew enormously as a filmmaker between making these films."
1,Oh nooo...Rodney again :((,"Could have been a good album without the Rodney tracks...I am personnaly very tired of his uninspired production,and the way he trashes some of my favourite artists albums.Last time it was Brandy, right after MJ, and now it's Mary Mary's turn :(I can't wait for the day everybody will be sick of his production, I really can't stand it anymore !"
3,"Mary, Mary -Incredible","I thought their voices had good range with a lot of emotion, however, the songs had the SAME hip-hop beat in the background. I could easily become bored with the CD, due to this reason.Lori"
1,disappointing,"Laszo's new book rather disappointed me. Nothing new. All he writes had nothing to do with The Field, or the inner movements of human beings. Rhe things he write down in 'Marcroshift' are better said by others before him. Much ado about nothing, that's my review."
2,"No ""life"" here","Don't know how EMI managed to mess this one up, but right-o mate. Dry, digitalis sound lacking any semblance of real performance in real hall. Somehow great pieces by world-class orchestra manage to sound lifeless. Example: Piano spread across sound-stage as wide and loud as the orchestra in the Gershwin, high piano notes come from the right and low notes from the left--the pianist is seated with his/her back to the audience at concerts? Horns get clammy. Others of similar title managed to get the essence of performance down, in contrast."
5,Urgent Wake Up Call To Action,"Author, Ed Ayres, of World Watch fame, calls upon us to wake from our 20th century excesses, to initiate the last positive choices we may ever have a chance to make, to bring the eco-system back into balance, and to take individual responsibility for the future of our own species. While we wring our hands over tragic daily headlines (Kosovo refugees), we ignore the death throes of our own mother planet. This book is very disturbing to read --in a good way. As a thinking, careing person, I can't go back to sleep, I must take action. The time is now, the place is here. Each one of us must change the future and save our beautiful, fragile planet from mass extinction. Write On Ed Ayers!NOTE TO AMAZON EDITORS: Please remove my earlier pre-view and replace with this actual re-view. Thanks."
1,junk,"i have done several remodels. i bought this book specifically for the contractor agreement.this book is nothing but a series of lists and a few illustrated methods. there is no advice, very few professional tips to help you avoid traps when working with contractors. and the contract at the end is worthless. i've seen a lot of contracts, and i wouldn't recommend that anyone sign that document.a waste of money."
4,Dion/Belmonts Hits evaluation,"There were songs that should have been included such as ""Somebody Nobody Wants"", Every Little Thing I do"" and ""Havin' Fun.However, they are all original and the CD contains numbers with the Belmonts and Dion when he was on his own"
4,I Grew Into It,"At first, the singer dude sounded all whacked out and stuff so I really didn't like it. But after a while, I started thinking that this was pretty cool, so I started liking it. The horns are kind of funny and also unique because they're used like in different ways and stuff like that. The guitars are like insane and really cool, and so is the bass. So this is a pretty cool CD and I'd recommend it to like ska/punk heads of course. This is kind of what my band sound like except my voice isn't as deep as this guy's.The best song is They Always Come Back. The cover art is kind of funny, with the nerd guy and stuff. Also check out Aquabats, The Clash (who wouldn't?), River City Rebels, Catch 22, Less Than Jake, and Reel Big Fish."
2,Transmitter,"Ipod sound-sounds raspy; alot of distortion. At times sounds fine, but fluctuates; you get what you pay for."
2,Not a very good FM Transmitter,"I brought this because the price was pretty cheap and thought it might work okay. The results was bad.. Most of the channels either had way too much static that it didn't work at all. Out of all the channels, perhaps 1 or 2 works half the time. Sometimes it is okay without any static, othertimes there is static and it just drives me nuts. Finally I decided to just listen to a lot of cds instead of using my ipod... I wish there was another way of listening to my ipod without going through a FM transmitter because most reviews I read seem to say bad things about them."
1,get over it,"it doesn't matter that they sound like someone else. it doesn't matter if their ""influences"" (i use this term lightly because if they are influenced by Joy Division they've sincerely disrespected them with this) are influenced by someone else. it sucks. take the album out of genre context and it still sucks. i downloaded the ""tear you apart"" song because i am a fan of post punk. but wow, its bad. really bad. the best reference is the ending. listen to the singer ""sing"" by himself. holy hell, thats awful. you can pretend all you want that in some way this is good. please reconsider so the music industry will stop mass producing duds like this."
3,So what ISN'T derivative today??,"Yeah, it sounds like a lot of 80's stuff, but who doesn't sound like SOMEBODY today? Bands like Nickelback can sell millions of CDs sounding like every generic band I've ever heard over the last thirty years. With almost every new band today plugging into the same tired, rehashed nu-metal/screamo/emo/shoegazing/pop-punk krap formula that wore out its welcome years ago, at least these guys are heading in the right direction. I long for the days when alternative radio stations were playing The Cure, Depeche, New Order, Tears for Fears, Talk Talk, etc., instead of the geared-for-tweens junk we hear now. And while SWR won't win any awards for songwriting originality, they at least show promise for what is, after all, their first effort. I think they could go far with their subsequent albums. My first suggestion for the next album? Add a real drummer!"
1,But sour grapes ALWAYS want revenge...,"Well, this thing is just awful. I see fans defending this band for plagiarizing by saying, ""Nothing is original anymore."" Great, lets just saw the top rungs off the ladder as we go down. Other fans say it's all just a joke(?!) Which is it?I think a better name for the band would have been She Sh*t The Bed."
4,Contrived? Yes Awful? No,"The 2000s have brought us an era of rock fandom where rock bands are often judged based on their indie credibility. Bands like Arcade Fire and Interpol have exploded in popularity due to their originality and DIY attitude. Thus it would seem that She Wants Revenge were bound to fail from the beginning; the band makes no secret of their goal to contrive an album similar to their 1980s role models. But no one anticipated that SWR would be so darn good at it. Fans of Interpol, Depeche Mode, and Joy Division will probably find it difficult not to love this album. If listeners can set aside SWR's broad lack of originality, on a smaller level they will find a fun, fresh, dark album that fits perfectly in the current 80s-heavy indie resurgence."
2,She Wants Revenge Wants To Be Interpol,"I'm making the comparison between these two bands for sound only, mainly the singer's voice. Just listening to the songs released so far on the radio is enough for me. I'm not really interested in buying their album because they sound like a second-rate wannabe Interpol, and SO NOT good lyrically. Where Interpol is subtle, haunting, intriguing and BRILLIANT, She Wants Revenge is the opposite. No mystery. Some may think their lyrics are edgy, with heavy sexual (read: teen angst) references, but I think they are too obvious. And I was way too generous giving them 2 stars and now I can't change it."
1,Trying Too Hard To Be Clever...,"""These Things"" is a decent listen; otherwise She Wants Revenge's sound is too diet Depeche/Sisters of Mercy (a VERY keen observation by another reviewer that I hadn't considered until now, but yes - Sisters of Mercy, definitely).At times (more often than not), the band tries too hard to be Interpol, with their faux-tortured, faux-psycho/sexual lyrics and sound. Put this CD up against Antics, and it's like the old laundry detergent commercials where the lady puts a clean sock up against a dingy one. It appears as if She Wants Revenge is attempting to co-opt a moment (I hate to label it, but what? Nu Wave? New New Wave?) inasmuch as 98 Degrees tried to jump on the Latin Explosion a few years ago.That said, I'm sure it takes time for any band to find their authentic sound, so maybe She Wants Revenge's next effort will be all their own."
1,Terrible,"I couldn't make it through this album. Imagine Interpol with even less of a clue and more overbearing artiness. Basically, I'm just writing this review so I can give it a 1 star, thus dropping it's overall score down where it belongs. Somewhere near -pi."
2,I was disappointed in this cd.,I loved the singles from this cd. But when I listened to it those songs were the only good ones on it.
1,wow,Just when you think that american pop rock can't get any slower...Think Joy Division on an american diet of fluff and shallowness. The vocalist tries his best to be Ian Curtis but the atmosphere and the intensity isn't there. Lyrically this album borders on emo because all they're doing is whining about women being mean. Aww.. naughty women were mean to these two fugs.In short.. this band is great for those who need things to be spelled out for them. Which makes it perfect for American teenagers :D.
3,"Indeed just like Interpol, but that doesn't make it bad","The first time I heard 'Tear You Apart' I immediately wondered who the hell these guys thought they were ripping off Interpol's sound. It wasn't just the lead singer's voice, they also had the same straight forward sexual lyrics that some people hate about Interpol. A few weeks later I bought the CD on sheer whim, and because it was cheap at Target. If I close my eyes, I can almost pretend I'm listening to Interpol. Otherwise it is just mildly catchy and eventually annoying new wave that is an OK listen. But don't get your hopes up, 'Tear You Apart' is the best song on the CD."
1,worthless,"we installed this CB in one of our CAT 525 skidders and it lasted about 6 months before the cheap circuitry failed. The price may tempt you but its just an extremely cheaply made radio, and it will fail. If you are looking for a simple reliable CB radio save yourself the time and headache and look into the Uniden Pro 520XL. We now run those in all of our logging equipment and have had very few problems. Much better radio for just a few bucks more.Edit: Wow I just noticed that the price on this radio has gone up to $80, that is a joke, please do not waste your money on this. I payed $39 a year ago for the same radio and I still feel ripped off! That price makes the Pro 520 look amazing, or even the entry level cobra."
5,Great Radio,"Radio works great. I read other reviews complaining about it changing to channel 9 when you turn it off. If you wire it so that it's hot all the time and just turn it off whith the knob, that don't happen. No complaints at all!!"
4,Good for the money,The radio is great. Clear reception and low squelch issues. The only draw back for my use is that everytime there is a loss of power to the radio it resets to Channel 9 and not the channel I am using. Tapping it into the fuse box instead of an accessoy plug should resolve the issue.
3,It's cheap,"The only thing I really don't like is the fact that it goes to channel 9 every time it is turned off. Gee, it probably would have cost 1 or 2 pennies to make it stay on the last channel used."
2,"Great Album, Worthless CD",The only CD player this works in is the one in my car which makes it almost useless to me. While I'd love to send it back it's not worth the cost.
3,Maximum sample rate is 16 kHz,"When you go into Control Panel / Sound in Windows and configure the microphone, you'll discover that the maximum quality setting is ""1 channel, 16 bit, 16000 Hz (Tape Recorder Quality)."" If tape recorder quality is all you need, then this adapter will work fine. If you're using your headphone for podcasting or adding voiceovers to screencasts, you may find this setting somewhat limiting."
5,Makes any Plantronics headset a usb compatable,This adapter clips in where the old telephone cord was attached and makes your Plantonics headset compatible with any computer.
3,An OK Book,"I'm an elementary school teacher and a Disney nut, so naturally I wanted to share these stories with the kids I teach. I found them to be much longer than the attention span of the kids I teach. I also read one story - Snow White - and there was quite a bit of death and adult themes at the beginning. The kids were kind of perplexed by all of this. It is great for nostalgia purposes and if parents were reading them as bed time stories (except the carnage parts)."
5,Brilliant,"Celtus really know how to write, produce and touch the very soul of the listener. This album is a classic example of their talent. From the poignant ""Shelter"", ""Hole in My Heart"", ""Angel"" to the raunchy ""What Goes Around"". Every number is just brilliant. A must have to add to an fabulous collection of Albums. To see them live is an absolute mind blowing experience. You come away a fan for life. They are lovely people too."
1,Parker Quality Problems,"Parker's reputation for quality is unwarranted in my experience. I bought a Parker Fly Mojo Midi in April 2011 (so, yes, conveniently for Parker, their one year warranty has expired). The guitar began buzzing on the lower register frets, while the higher registers were buzz-free. Seems unlikely, right? i took the guitar to my local guitar tech who pointed out that the fretboard is separating from the neck. I am an amateur who plays the guitar several hours a week. The guitar has been out of my house once, for a two hour jam session. I would be angry if a $300 Mexican Strat suffered such a fate after a year and a half of gentle play. But a $4,000 guitar?!?! Looks like a replay of CBS' purchase of Fender. Unfortunately, I have a Post - U.S. Music Corp. Parker Fly, which will probably have all the value of a post-CBS Fender down the road. STEER CLEAR OF PARKER UNTIL THEY FIX THEIR QUALITY ISSUES!!! Caveat Emptor!!"
1,oops,"If you follow the advice in ""Play Winning Poker In No Time"" and play poker you will lose. A tip-off should be the title. Serious players can spend a lifetime attempting to play winning poker and never succeed. In No Time comes complete with huge errors, for example, the author gives her version of the rules of Texas Hold em. ""Players win by forming the best five-card hand using their two hole cards and three of the community cards."" In fact, a player may use any five-card combination from the board and personal cards. A player may even use all of the boardcards and no personal cards to form a hand (play the board). This means all the chapters in this book on assessing table position, evaluating your starting hand and so forth are flawed. Go ahead and use the book. I look forward to playing against you."
3,A bit overwhelming,"This book is packed with information -- which is great. But it can be a little overwhelming. I would recommend it for the amount of material covered, but I think it can make relaxation seem like a bit of a job. I have difficulty picking up various types of techniques (i.e. meditation) by reading. I think listening to a podcast or attending a class might be more helpful for those types of things. But it is a wonderfully thorough source of information on many types of relaxation techniques and, if nothing else, serves as a great starting point."
5,A well written volume on a very broad subject,"Coyle has put together a very concise and comprehensive introductory work to a timely subject. While some background in science or forensics is useful before diving into this book, being an expert is by no means necessary. While I won't go so far as to call this volume an ""easy read"", it is far more understandable to the layperson then some other materials I have read on this subject.Chapter by chapter, the authors build on the basics of plant science, physiology, and genetics to bring the reader up to a working understanding of the world of forensic botany. This is book is an excellent primer for folks who have a basic knowledge of plant science or forensic science and are interested in how the two tie together.The example cases do so much to make the rest of the material understandable. I only wish that there were more of these cases.To the authors - bravo and thank you!"
2,where is my filter?,i ordered this iten and i did not get all the parts... i didnt get the filter which is the more important part... what the hell??
3,Not what I wanted,"I've been looking for a longer bread pan, one that is 11"" in length. I hoped this would be that size, but it wasn't, but the shippment was quick and the return was easy."
4,unexpectedly good,super good movie with the unexpected in it... i love when there are twists.. and this movie has them. enjoy!
4,Awesome Movie,This movie was great. Many things like this may go on in the armed forces that we don't know about. This movie gives the idea of how it is dealt with and how some people are just ignorant to the fact that something like this is going on at there base. I would recommend this movies to anybody. Don't go out and rent it buy it. Really awesome movie.
5,HIGHlarious!,"Damn this movie is funny. I watched it very drunk last night on a movie channel at a buddies house. The part where the three guys drive that tank all doped up is HIGHlarious! You should buy the movie just for that. For some reason this movie kinda reminds me of Fightclub with some of the camera stuff (or I'm just making this up cause I was really drunk last night....). But anyways, it's a hilarious movie with some good plot. Buy it...."
4,zany military comedy,"Zany military comedy in the spirit of Sgt. Bilko or Gomer Pyle in which Joachim Phoenix plays an enlisted man, sprung from jail to join the Army, pulls off an outrageous scam to enrich himself and also, worse still, romances the Sargeant's daughter, played by Anna Pacquin. Unfortunately, possibly because neither Ed Harris nor Scott Glenn can consistently sustain the comedic levels of Phil Silvers or the drill sargeant in Pyle, this film at times cannot decide if its comedy or drama. Still, for the most part, the film is hilarious and well worth the rental price."
3,It deserves the price,"I knew the director Stephen Sommers via Deep Rising, thus considered he's a director producing good film with limited budget.Also, for the less than 5 dollar disc, the other thriller The Puppet Masters really make me feel 'unrelenting suspense and nonstop action'"
4,Good Movie,Never saw The puppet masters...but I loved Deep Rising. Good under-rated movie that keeps you in your seat. Would recommend to anyone. I guess I'll go watch the puppet masters now.
4,Great Sci-Fi Combo...,"I've loved both of these movies for a long time, and to have them finally available on Blu-Ray and together... Deep Rising is a fun sea-monster movie with the incredibly beautiful Famke Janssen. It is a fast paced, get your blood going, romp. It has humorous moments that often show it doesn't take itself too seriously and a couple of touching scenes that you don't usually find in this type of film. Puppet Masters is an updated invasion of the body snatchers style sci-fi with a little unique spice and Sutherland thrown in."
4,Good 90's popcorn flick !,There's nothing much to say about this two movies combo but lay back and enjoy the 90's (with popcorn and soda in hand) !!!
1,DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I bought the McAfee Internet Security Suite last year and i would NEVER use McAfee ever again. I am absolutely disgusted with their poor customer service. I had problems with my software working on a different computer -it wouldn't install. Anyway, i called them and spoke to a mcafee agent who was unable to help. I also tried the Mcafee chat on their website to see whether they could help me -no luck. So i emailed them SEVERAL TIMES and they still did not help me. This software is now useless to me and i haven't even been able to use it on my computer. Their customer service was very poor. Instead of offering me an exchange they expected me to contact the technical dept. that charges $2.95 (i think)/minute as it was over 30 days that i purchased it. I cannot believe how mcafee has treated me on this matter. Lets just say they won't be getting another cent from me"
3,Great Buddy... fake stereo?,"It's one step forward and two steps back with this reissue that collates some excellent sides by Buddy Clark, then adds fake stereo and echo, not unlike an ""electronically reprocessed"" reissue of the 60s! Why, oh why, must American master recordings languish in the vaults, leaving it to import labels like Vocalion to muck things up? Five stars for music, docked two for audio quality."
2,PAUL SELLS OUT ON MULTIPLE LEVELS,"This allbum is made in response to the dark sides of the music industry, which produces boring music with little positive, inventive and interesting growth in hip-hop. Paul merely glazes over the issues, well known and easily identifiable to an intelligent audience. It seems that Paul, although making fun of the industry, has succumbed to the industry's will and is making a boring, typical mainstream hip-hop album with a touch of cynicism. In effect Paul has acknowledged the industries power in mass-producing hip-hop for the intent of sales, not musical development. Paul doesn't go anywhere past dissing the musical industry. He himself is perpetuating the terrible trends of the music industry. So Paul sells out, he sells out to loyal fans who must be dissapointed with this work and to the gullible mainstream audience.Despite this he makes an enjoyable typical celebrity filled hip-hop album."
3,Key is missing,"I bought it,and the software is good, but I don't recieve a key to update.This software broke my firefox mozilla...That's it.Ernesto."
5,"The Postcard, a very nice book.",I found this book interesting to read. I found myself flowing through the story with ease. The characters were very likealbe and seemingly real. I look forward to reading the sequel. Thanks Beverly.......
3,So-so,I wasn't to thrilled with this book. I was really upset with how it ended in Rachael's mother being mean to Mr. Bradley like she was. This showed me another side to the Amish fictions out there. I completely understand that everyone has their bad side and in this book it showed how some are rather rude when they don't want to talk or be around someone.
5,A wonderful guide to superstitions,This is a great book full of rare and obscure superstitions from all over the world. I was pleasantly surprised by this book's diverse content. If you can find this book I feel it is worth buying.
3,Good if you don't have a PC.,"The Lunar Module reference is a detailed look at the spacecraft that landed on the moon with a reproduction quality comparable to the original (which was not too great to begin with). This document was intended as a reference for the press and contains nearly everything you wanted to know about the spacecraft and all its systems. For those with an interest in the nuts-and-bolts details of this amazing craft, it can't be beat! The only caveat: If you have a PC, get the Apollo documents CD-ROM that is also offered by World Spaceflight News which contains this document in PDF format as well as the Apollo CSM news reference and MUCH MORE and print it out yourself. If not and you really want to know how this spacecraft really worked, by all means buy this edition."
3,A little underwhelming,"Compared to my other titanium pans, this one is lightweight and slower to heat up. It is great for crepes, but I don't think we'll use it for much else."
4,King Solomon's Mines,This version of the classic story by H. Rider Haggard has always been my favorite. Stewart Granger WAS Allan Quatermain and filming in Africa extended the illusion that this was more 'authentic' then the other versions filmed. Still a fun film to watch
4,GREAT CLASSIC FILM,This is a great film.The print was quite good.Would reccomended to anyone who likes classic films
3,Only rented it to see Deborah Kerr.,Didn't watch the whole movie yet just wanted to see how Deborah Kerr looked. Most of her most notable movie's is when she was older. I just wanted to see what she looked like when she was younger. Sounds shallow but I will watch the whole movie later.
5,Great Griddle,"So far so good with this griddle. I've used it a few times and it cooks and cleans up well. The only thing in cooking with it is that I found it cooks faster in the center bc of the circle coil and the edges are less brown...must be out of the direct range of the heat? Also, on the amazon description, it stated that it wasn't recommended for glass top stoves but in the caphalon care booklet it said otherwise. I'm using on my new glass top stove and it seems fine.Any ideas or experiences with why it wouldn't be recommended for a glass top stove?"
5,Worth Every Penny,This is my first yoga CD purchase and I am pleasantly suprised. I have listened to other samples and I think this one is better than the ones that have 5 stars. It is more up temo than most yoga CD's I hear.
1,What a horrible album,"Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star). But it's quite called for here. CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album. Average production. Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content. The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.An amateur job all around. It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape. There's definitely growing pains all throughout. Skip to his later selection."
3,HE COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER,"I KNOW CAM HAS MUCH MORE SKILLS THAN HE DISPLAYED ON HIS ALBUM. I THINK HE SHOULD'VE SPIT MORE SHIT LIKE ON GLORY, A PIMPS A PIMP, AND WHO'S NICE. I LIKE WHEN RAPPERS SPIT LYRICS THAT MAKE YOU WANNA GO BACK AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER. I WANNA BE ABLE TO BE AMAZED EVERYTIME I HEAR A RHYME. I EXPECTED A LOT MORE FROM HIM, BUT HE'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE RAPPERS."
1,I'm very disappointed!!!!,"After reading all of the reviews, I couldn't wait to get this CD. I am most disappointed and if I could get a refund, I would. Cam is very vulgar, he is quite misleading with ""Horse and Carriage"". I knew that there would be some explicit lyrics, but he is a joke and Mase is along for the ride. This artist won't get another dime from me and Mase should take heed."
5,Absolutely beautiful photography of a breathtaking area.,"Gary Geiger's photography draws you in and makes you want to jump on the nearest train, plane or automobile to drink in the beauty and wonder of the Monterey/Carmel area."
5,So far so good,I am still reading the book. But so far it has been very helpful and taught me quite a few things that I have needed. I really just use it as a resource book instead of just reading through it. But overall I am very happy with this purchase.
2,Not for me,"I am a beginner to embroidery, but not to sewing. I recently purchased the Singer Futura 250 (awesome) and bought this as a companion book after reading great reviews. It wasn't what I expected. It looked like it was from the 80s/90s, didn't feel up to date. The ""free embroidery designs"" looked a bit cheesy/cheap feel. I was actually able to figure out my embroidery machine on my own with the product manual and can search the internet (for free) for any future questions I have. While some people might like the book, it wasn't for me and was a waste of my money. I returned it."
4,"How to Stabilize,Hoop and stitch","This book de-mysterfies hooping,and stabilizers.The diagrams are clear and precise,there are no ommissions of needed detail.It will be a regular guide for me and my hooping skills will be definitely improved.My machine embroidery will become a pleasure again with less stressI would highly recommend this book to anyone who feels like giving up trying, the answers are there."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought the book because I have a new Bernina emboidery machine, although this book has excellent photos, and step by step projects, it only shows designs and examples from most machine but Berninas. If you are trying to but a book as a reference for projects, this book is great. I will have to keep looking for something that shows at least one example on a Bernina machine, and more information on how to get designs from a computer, internet, and the use of the magic box."
4,Nearly perfect,I ordered two of these for keeping kids artwork neat on the fridge. I had a lot of trouble finding reasonably priced 8.5 x 11 magnetic frames but these are a good value. They look great for my purpose and work well. My only complaint is one that others have pointed out in the reviews and thus I knew before buying - it's not easy to get the paper in and out of the frames. This wouldn't be a problem if you were going to leave the same item in the frame for a long time but I like to switch out the artwork every few days. I followed other reviewers tips and kept the paper that came with the frame as well as a couple other sheets of paper and leave them in the frame all the time. That helps to slide a new piece in and out easier. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase though and could see getting more.
3,baseball hat,"The site did not have a picture of the baseball cap on it, and when we received the cap, it was not the same as the cap that the minor league team wears. Next time I will know better !!!"
4,Kids LOVE it!!,My kiddos love this movie short. I enjoy watching it with them. I always like Shreks witty and cynical humor. The kids just sit and giggle.
1,Not worth the money,I guess I am the only one that hated the Shrek portion of this double pack. I don't feel like it is appropriate for children and I found it to be any thing but funny. Doing the take on Psycho where Pinnochio's head spins and he throws up on Shrek is the point where I turned it off. My husband watched it all the way through and agreed that it is not appropriate for children. I was very dissappointed. The Monsters vs Pumpkins looks to be a cute story however I have only seen the first 7 minutes so I will be back with my review on it.
4,running man,"my son runs track and this balm really helped his thigh bruise that he had been dealing with. very good product, just don't use too much at one time."
2,Not happy...,The light does not work. The performance of the trimmer is fine but I of course expected the light to work.
4,"Nice, Very nice.","I have listened to this album now for the fourth time today. It has those beats that beg you to listen to them over and over again. It has a fresh, almost psycadelic atmosphere to it. Rza must have been in a good frame of mind when he created these beats. This is vintage RZA minus the Bobby persona with strong lyrics. The MCS he lines up here are very good and are prefect for RZAs production. I don't know about five stars because that is saved for CLASSIC albums, and this isn't quite classic YET. I'll wait 10 years then listen to it.Overall nice, classic rza beats with cool, breezy lyrics."
3,I like it but I prefer the Red Album,"I purchased the Red Album first and its my only other early GFR recording, so its my benchmark.This recording does a great job of presenting the energy of an early rock concert, lots of energy, great muscianship. I haven't compared the song list side by side but it just seems that most of the Live Album sounds the Red Album.I prefer the Red Album because of how the instruments are mixed. In the car with the subwoofer rockin' at a 78hz cutoff the bass guitar really speaks to me. The guitar is good to, but when the bass player slides down the low string to the nut it really rattles the subwoofer to a good effect. Its a minor complaint for the Live Album, I just prefer how the the bass is mixed on the Red Album.I'd recommend the Red Album if you've never experienced Grand Funk Railroad in its early days."
2,Too lumbering!,"There are some bands that are better enjoyed in a live context and some better dealt with in a recorded context. Grand Funk Railroad, at this juncture in their career, was practically unlistenable in this live context. The songs are neither melodic nor do they have a dynamic worthy of following.While I respect rawness, the (at the time) Midwestern, no-nonsense approach and simplicity of the trio format, if anybody needed help in sharpening their sound it was this band.I usually detest the honing and commercialization of a band but Grand Funk needed it.With proper production, their later recorded works were far superior. Even when their career embarassingly involved doing covers (Loco Motion, Some Kind of Wonderful), it was still much better than this stuff. ""Caught in the Act"" is a better live record since they were a better, more mature band.This is for Grand Funk completists only"
1,"Half great, half not","When it comes to classical music recordings, I only have 2 absolutes-get the notes right and stay on pitch. Everything else is negotiable. Sadly, this recording has all too frequent occurances of the latter. Which is a great shame as Radu Lupu's piano work is outstanding, perfectly suited for Mozart. The violinist however, simply wasn't up to the task. There are very few instruments that shiver the spine when off-key like a violin. This collection has those moments in virtually every movement. It is one of the very few recordings I've ever heard where it's hard to figure why it was ever put on disc, or continued after the 1st day of recording for that matter. With so many other collections available, look elsewhere."
2,ANIMEIGO Transfer,"This is just a review of the technical aspect of the film. I thought the Animeigo transfer was horrible. The sound is especially horrendous as it is extremely tinny and grating. I had to almost turn the sound off to make it bearable...thank God for subtitles! The colors were good but it looked like a digital photo ""sharpened"" too many times. I prefer the previous company, Image Entertainment. Plus, you get a cool poster of the movie...:p Finally, just let me clarify that this is only for the quality of the transfer NOT the content which is the usual fun and cool Zatoichi!"
2,This is the review you been looking for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Here are the pros and conts:Good:* Great cinematography.* Awesome moves by Zatoichi.* Great acting.Bad:* The dvd trailer fool you by showing a horse battle, barrel battle, daylight forest battle and a bridge battle that didn't appear in the movie!!!!!!!!!!* There were like 3 action scenes in the whole movie and the only one that was cool was the night forest battle.* To much blah,blah,blah!!!!!!!!!!!!Sometimes I think that the best Zatoichi movie is Zatoichi goes to the Festival of Fire!!!P.S: If you like to see movies like this, I recommend to buy the original Zatoichi in 1962.Adios!!"
2,Fails to meet Sony design standards and warranty support,This product is not designed or built to the usually high Sony standards. The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails. My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs. Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty.
4,Nice to see the corrected song sequence-,"I sold my first LP copy some years ago. I'm not sure why, now. I must have been desperate. So a year or so ago, I bought my second LP copy, used, cheap. This time it included ""Spirits in The Night"", another decent Springsteen cover, after ""Blinded By the Light"". The problem was the album sequence (this on the LP, not the CD) They put ""Spirits"" in the MIDDLE of the best transition between tracks on the album, and one of my favorite transitions on ANY album- between ""Road To Babylon"" and ""This Side of Paradise"" - ruining that wonderful transition.Who's bright idea was THAT LP song placement? SO, last weekend I bought another LP copy of the original configuration, without ""Spirits in the Night""...I note that on the CD release, they wised up and moved ""Spirits in the Night"" almost to the end (only followed by the singles version of ""Blinded By the Light"")."
4,Great Re-Mastered CD,"I Highly Recommend this re-master of this album. It has great sound & a few bonus tracks to boot, so if your a fan of Manfred Mann's Earth Band, I Highly recommend getting it! What Are Ya Waiting For? Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn."
4,****,"It's good, but can get repetitive. ""Im the greatest because..."", but alot of the songs (like Lucifer and Allure) are Great."
3,Not a Classic,"This wasn't as great as I was expecting at all actually, there are some strong tracks on it, but overall, it's considerably weak. I agree with the reviewer that said Nas is better. His lyrics don't really focus on anything in my opinion, he just kinda jumps around talking about nothing in particular, at least that's the way it seems to be. This is just average. Nothing on it really sticks with me, with the exception of Moment Of Clarity and Dirt off Your Shoulders, which I think are the best tracks on here. 3 stars"
3,worse than expected,"This album is a disapointment because the songs arent that good and he doesnt have that many songs on it. I gave it an extra star just because it's jayz. But this album pretty much sucks.And for his so called retirement, he should have done better. I recommed memphis bleek's album MADE. It is much better than all of jayz albums except Resonable Doubt"
2,Another Lazy album by Jay-Z,"I was feeling some songs, but none of them varied from his patented formula- a hot beat to make up for the less than prolific lyrics and presentation. Beyond the hype there lies the same substance (or lack thereof) on ""The Black Album"". This is will be in now way the ""last"" album. Look for greatest hits compilations, never before released material, etc."
1,................................,"The best song on this album is the public service announcement. The rest of the album is medocre, at best. Definatly not the way to solitify a career as big as jay-z's. To many non-thought provoking lyrics, with average beats. Hey at least he made one good cd in his career, which was obviously his first ""reasonable doubt."" If your a hardcore jay-z fan, then you'll probably pick this up if you havent already, if you've liked a few of jay-z's songs maybe albums, this probably aint for you, but i could be wrong."
3,Could have been better,"This is a good album, If it was Murphy Lees. Come on Jigga for your last album, It should have been way tighter then this. Ive heard better from you in the past."
1,Overrated,I don't think Jay-Z is as good as everyone thinks he is. This album is strongly overrated. I have heard some of the songs on it and I just cant get into them. This is not very good for a retirement album.
3,Not his last CD,"Good lie to get sales though, but it's an OK album at best. Beats are solid but Jay slips one in a while."
2,can't beleive I paid fo' dis!,"As far as I can tell, Jay-Z's popularity definitely doesn't come from being a talented rapper. He would do the world a favor by NOT releasing another album.What's really annoying about this album is how it's such a shameless tribute to himself. In some cases, the contrast between his self-glorifying message and his awkward rhymes and unimaginative lyrics borders on absurd. His apologies and excuses, such as in Moment of Clarity, were pretty hilarious, too."
1,You Gotta Feel Sorry For This Guy,"Ever noticed that rap/hip-hop albums generally suck? They might have a few ""hits"" on it and the rest is just crap, or filler. Ever nocticed that metal/thrash albums are generally completely solid with awesome songs but most of the time there are no ""hits""? Ever noticed that rap/hip-hop ""artists"" get 20 times more money than metal artists? Even though they actually tour and have talent and spent years sitting playing their guitars/basses/drums. This is not right. Rap ""artists"" don't spend time writting riffs to deserve their money, they spend it clubbing and whatever they do. All of Mr. Jay-Z's ""music"" is about how hard his life is and pimpin' around. Metal music is much deeper. They sing about pain and how they feel towards life. To be enlightened buy: ""Reign In Blood""-Slayer, ""Master of Puppets""-Metallica, ""Shovel Headed Kill Machine""-Exodus, ""Ride the Lightning""-Metallica, or ""Clayman""-In Flames. These are real albums."
4,Worth Buying,"I think this is a good album. it is worth buying, but it you want Jigga's best, then pick up ""Reasonable Doubt"" or ""The Blueprint"" The best songs on this album are ""Change clothes"", ""99 Problems"", and ""PSA"" This album is a good way to start off for a casual Jay-Z fan, but if you want to hear the very best of Jay-Z , then I think you would want to buy Reasonable Doubt."
4,"Good, but not great","With The Black Album I was expecting a return to the Reasonable Doubt Jay-Z. No MTV rhymes and just Jay going out of the game like he came in, on top. While some of the songs might remind you of Reasonable Doubt, he still didn't reach that level. I don't want to make this album sound like a disappointment, because it wasn't. Many of the tracks were very good, the beats were tight, and Jay's lyrics were pretty nice as well. I don't know if this is truly Jay's final album, but if it is then I would say that he went out with a good album, but like I said before, its a good album, just not a great one.My 3 Favorite Tracks:Moment Of ClarityPublic Service Announcement (Interlude)My 1st Song"
5,Going Away Party,Jigga's final album is one of the best rap records released in a long while! This album does not have a bad track on it! I believe Jay-z picked the right album to retire on!
3,better as the grey album,"i love this...as the grey album.i don't like the regular versions of alot of the songs...but mix in a little beatles and it's so much better.""most of y'all know where i'm lyrically at""lyrically, yes. nice.too bad there's no legal version of the grey album."
4,"IF YOU GOTTA GO, GO IN STYLE","This is yet another tight album from Jigga. Not the classic that 'Reasonable Doubt' or 'The Blueprint' were, but a strong effort just the same. DECEMBER 4th is blaze with a dramatic track and the usual Jay lyrics. Check out WHAT MORE CAN I SAY for more of that same sick rhyming as you here him vent on what he believes is haters and critics sleeping on him. Hell, even the interludes are hot! Whether he really leaves the game this time or not, he made a worthwile record."
5,brooklyn is bak on the map,one of the dopest lp's ever made its simply a classic. Too bad he is retiring but i guess its all good .Jay z is definately the best rapper alive no question we gon miss u hov.... but if in a couple years time no change pls come bak and reclaim ur spot
5,HOVA Reigns SUPREME!!!,"Although he will be missed, it's wise for Jigga to bow out at this point in his career. It's hard to stay relevant in this game. What he's leaving us with stands up against his other classics (Reasonable Doubt, Vol.2 Hard Knock Life, The Blueprint). Jay comes through on Dirt Off Your Shoulder, Moment of Clarity, 99 Problems, Encore and Threat. While there is no perfect album, this comes close, but the haters will always find fault. The only thing I would have wanted would be a few more tracks. The album moves quickly, which leaves you wanting more, which actually adds to the brilliance. As there have been many, Jay-Z will and already has, gone down in history as one of the greatest MC's ever. Long live JAYHOVA!!!"
5,A Masterpiece...,"The Black Album was released so quickly it made heads spin. But it was also a sad release, because it marked ""the final album"" from america's greatest MC. I was sad to hear the news, but at least The Black Album is a terrific final effort. It ranks among Jay's top 4 albums. and it can even compete with the likes of The Blueprint and Reasonable Doubt. The album is better than The Blueprint 2.0 as well.The Black Album features amazing production from Kanye West(who's album is HOTT!), Eminem, and Just Blaze. The Neptunes also make admirable production appearances on Change Clothes and Allure, two of the album's best tracks. Pharrell also appears on Change Clothes. The album's best tracks are Change Clothes, Encore, and Moment of Clarity, produced by Eminem."
1,Making Excuses,Its just sad that the nicest comments about this album are people kmaking excuses for why its not so great. Just sad.
3,hovi,"though jigga fell out with me when he said he was better than biggy, along the line he's gained back my respect. with with songs like ""a dream,the watcher,what more can i say and my all time favourite jigga tune ""change"" from the blue print. now lets get back to the black album, its not one of he's best album, but he still proved hes there with the best ( nas, biggy,jada,snoop)though jigga said this is hes last album, anybody out there wants to bet with me that hovi's gonna be back again? i gave this a album 3stars cuz its nothing special, its just in there. if you wanna hear jigga at hes best check out, reasonable doubt and the blueprint. so till jigga comes knocking at the rap doors again. am hovi out"
3,Jigga has lost a step,"It's damn hard to top a classic. Especially when the classic was your debut album. Jigga's ""quality"" has dropped after Reasonable Doubt and Vol.1 ""In My Lifetime"". When Jigga claimed his last album would have the hunger that he had in Reasonable Doubt, I set my standards high, and maybe that's my fault. The hunger isnt there in this one, the man has had his fill. lyrically, i'm tired of hearing about the lear jets, the bentley's, the cristal, the money, the women, and the paper chase. That's all that's in the album. When the original ""Blueprint"" came out I was certain he was coming back, he tries to maintain it, but he just falls flat. I give him 3 stars because even though he's weak in this one he still has a couple of cuts where he shows that shine. However, overall... if this is his lasting impression on his career, then he certainly showed why he should be retiring."
3,"Not bad, not geat","This album is no Blueprint 1. Also I think, as others have said, the producers could have come up with some better stuff. Kanye's stuff, for example, is not as mindblowing here as it was on ""Some People Hate."" But it's (and the rest's are) still very good. I think the strongest track, lyrically, is ""Allure,"" which, to me, sounds very un-Neptunes, beat-wise, but this couldn't be one of those lyrics J rushed--it has depth, and there's sophistication there."
5,Horner's Best - A must for all Soundtrack Fans,"I saw the movie by accident (a friend rented the VCR). I instantly recognized Horner, and was held to my seat. Now I own the music CD and love the music even more... If you love the magic of Spanish guitar with trumpets, this is will keep you in goose-bumps. What can I say? I've probably got 75% of Horner's Soundtracks, and this is the best..BY FAR!"
5,majestic,"This is a master piece of music. the guitars are superb. if you like spanish music, this is for you."
2,Sadly Dissapointing,"The movie was great, but this score just doesn't sound good by itself! In most places it is just too quiet, slow, and repetitive. An action movie score that is actually sold to the public needs to be exciting, with more...well, action! Don't ruin the movie by buying this score, but if you're a classical fan, you just might like it."
4,wonderfull cd!brings out the best in james horner,"""Oh, great,""I said when I picked this up in the store.""Mexican music"". But when saw that it was by James Horner I decided that it couldn't be all that bad.So I got it and was astounded. Track 7, the confession, was absolutely stunningly beautifull I couldn't get it out of my head. Track 8,zorro's theme, is like a spanish sunset, beautifull with even small hint of swashbuckling music in it. Also one of horners more original in my opinion. All in all definetely one for Horner fans!"
2,Alice Cooper - 'Dada' (Warner Brothers),"Not sure as to WHERE these numerous upbeat reviews of this reissue came from.Question:did these fans even listen to this CD?I've been a HUGE Alice Cooper fan since his original band released 'Killer' and 'School's Out',but this 1983 release really bites!!Nice lp cover,though.Just two cuts here even make the CD semi-worth keeping the disc around,which are the title track ""Dada"" where it appears that Alice is sitting on a couch telling his problems to his psychologist and ""Former Lee Warner"" where he speaks about his deformed brother the family needs to keep hidden in the upstairs room.For die-hards ONLY."
4,Definately Underated,"Very reminiscent of America's Sweethearts, this comedy of Hollywood meets Smalltown, USA was really cute. Julia Stiles and Sarah Jessica Parker are fantastic as Julia tries to work her way to Hollywood by seducing the movie's leading man (Alec Baldwin) and Sarah tries to maintain her starlett aura by seducing everyone. The main story line, involving Phillip Hoffman's (the screenwriter) struggle to constantly re-write his story to fit the film and, in tandem, fall in love with a small town woman, is a bit long in the tooth. One has to credit Hoffman though, becuase he plays out the part beautifully while keeping it light."
3,"Stumbles around a bit, and then...","...finally turns out to be just a piece of fluff after all.David Mamet makes a business of (really) supertalkyhead games. He somehow gets his movies madedespite the fact that Hollywood probably can't standhis scripts, and he's been lucky to stay indy-in-spirit longenough to gather a following to his hardnosed brandof gab. Here again, the same only different.Instead of his usual deadpan rapid fire talk-feature,Mamet gives the facade of an actual Hollywood film. Onlyof course it isn't. It's the anti-Hollywood film that is a movieinside a movie, and it's all so dripping with irony thatya wanna drown yerself.Yeah, well, it turns out that his great ensemble cast islargely lost amid a lackluster script and a hackneyedconcept to begin with. Too bad."
4,STATE AND MAIN,"A GOOD LIGHT COMEDY SPOOFING MOVIE MAKING IN A SMALL TOWN. MANY COMICAL SCENES, ENTERTAINING, NOT A CLASSIC BUT DEFINITELY WORTH SEEING."
2,A Very Negative Depiction of Being a Therapist,"This book is extremely negative. He describes the clients as if they are sucking the life out of the therapist. If I were to read this book upon starting my education in Counseling, I would have promptly dropped out. Luckily, I know better!"
3,Finishes off a first degree program well,"If you are ready to go out and save the world, this book presents a bit more reasonable set of expectations. Probably the most important is the expectation that laughing at one's self is healthy."
5,AWESOME,My girls love playing with these on their toy kitchen. They are cute little miniature replicas of the real thing!
3,"Oh Frankie, you've done it again","You're completely whacky, over-the-top characters and storytelling continues to entertain me.Tom Benton is a trademark Frank Yerby hero who grabs life by the horns, pushes men around, sleeps with any woman he wants whether she likes it or not, gets rich at the expense of others, and then wonders why his children turn out the way they do."
3,"Made my stomach hurt, but was good in other ways.","This stuff made my stomach hurt, but was good in other ways. I don't know if it was interacting with all of the other supplements & organic herbs that I am taking, but it is surely not for me because the other stuff that I take I can not risk stopping for the few positives that this offers me. The only things that it did for me was it made me regular in the bathroom area & I know (TMI ha ha), but it worked for that. I don't think it is a bad product just my stomach was burning & hurting bad every time I took only this product & for that I am never taking this again. I will try instead natural organic fresh dandelion greens from Trader Joe's. But good luck to everyone else who takes this product."
3,It didnt work for me,"I tried this and only seemed to be retaining more water! Perhaps it was just the wrong time to try it, but that is what happened!"
2,DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,I have to say that I took this product for two months and I don't know if it did anything at all. I felt no difference in energy or anything else.
1,Bugger,"DO NOT BE FOOLED. Those of Bridget fans waiting for the next installment. . . this isn't it, nor is it a springboard for what is to come. It won't tide you over to the next book. It is silly. A waste of paper and effort (v.b). Honestly. Love Bridget. Love Helen. D.N. love this book."
1,Humph.,"Being former Singleton & big fan of Bridget Jones' Diary (book & movie...oooh, Mr. Darcy!), I bought this ""Guide to Life"" hoping for another gem. Humph. The best section is entitled ""The Art of Conversation"" & it covers about 2 pages. Is mostly gobble-de-gook & lame B&W; pictures of getting mold off cheese & how to order pizza. (what Singleton doesn't already have these down pat?)Good thing about book: Hurrah, is only 55 pages & will be over soon!"
1,What Happend Helen???,"Let me begin with stating I LOVED Bridget Jones Diary, Edge of Reason and Cause Celeb; and have recommended them to everyone I know. HOWEVER, this thin bit of nothing was horrid. It was painful to read, with mere allusions to the side-splitting antics excected of Helen Fieldings characters. This is one that will end up in my recycling bin."
1,The nadir of Furnier's career,This album is dire. Production is overblown and the quality of the songs is consistently poor.I think the key to this album is to drink a litre bottle of Jack Daniels & then listen to it. Only then will you truly appreciate it. I IS NOT GOODIf you see it in a record store - PUT IT BACK AND WALK AWAY
4,A great 70's metal album!,"I'm a true Aero-fan so of course I like this one very much indeed. It's a bit too electric but a very good one.My favorite songs from this album are Same Old Song And Dance, Lord Of The Thighs, S.O.S. and Seasons Of Wither.The other ones are good too. The album sometimes fast and hard sometimes slow. If you like 70's hard rock I can recommend it."
4,Only two songs are only OK the rest kick ass!,"The only two songs on here that are just OK are Spaced and Woman of the World (though still good) the rest are totally awesome from the fast-paced SOS (Too Bad) and Train Kept a Rollin to the slow tempoed ballad Seasons of Whither (undoubtedly the best ballad Aerosmith ever made). Lord of the Thighs is a teeny bit overrated to me but I still like it a lot. All in all, this album rocks and should be purchased by anybody who wants to know old, hardcore Aerosmith."
4,so far so good,"I was hesitant to buy from a company I'd never heard of, but after 2 months of use about 4 days a week it's held up great. The retract on it is nice and smooth even fully extended, the numbers on both sides is awesome, and the build quality feels very sturdy. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but the only con is that the magnets aren't as strong as I hoped. It sticks if you extend it to something, but isn't quite strong enough to grip as you pull away. I wish they made this model with a self lock."
5,One of the best books about the 1000 Islands I've seen!,"I am so glad that someone has this book out there!! A rare find, out of print and that is ashame! This author is a fantastic writer and the fact that he is blind makes it all the more amazing - his descriptions and stories and life about the area is fantastic and funny too. What a spriit he has. He also has another book about his blindness, childhood, how he learned, met his wife, etc. He is a very upbeat guy. I rec'd this to anyone interested in the New York 1000 Island region, blindnss and how to be positive about all of life's little stumbles (he doesn't teach that- he just shows it by how he lives). Great read."
3,"In This Superficial Industry, Plenty Goes On Beneath the Surface","Chris Rock digs deep into the various elements at play in the big-money world of black hairstyling. In between interviews with the small local businesses who are unashamedly making a killing on weaves, (one blue-haired stylist with a full waiting room proudly proclaims that her work ""starts at a thousand"") Rock finds some unsettling truths about the origins of this product, the toxicity of the ever-popular ""relaxers"" women are gladly globbing onto their scalps, and the showy world of celebrity hairdressers in Atlanta. Rock's no Michael Moore, and the investigative bits are revealing but not particularly thorough; he's at his best when he's in his element, joking with patrons and poking fun at the hapless boyfriends mournfully waiting for their wallets to run out of steam in the lobby. A bit long at ninety-six minutes; it's only got enough gas for seventy or eighty, but it's decent fun while it lasts."
5,Best of Alan Parsons,I personally think this is the best of any of Alan Parsons Works. I have the album and the CD and I wouldn't part with neither for any amount of money.
3,M.I.A. - Galang '05,"On this second disc of GALANG remixes, Serj Tankian seems to be embracing the chaos theory of remixing and does a thrash-lite version that saps the energy out of the original. The DJ C mix of ""U.R.A.Q.T."" works much better, becoming a digitally upbeat dirty call."
2,CALIGARI,"Two star rating indicates I didn't, particularly, enjoy film, which isn't entirely true --it was hysterical! (still laughing) Dark eyeliner rules. Acting was mediocre at best (intense)..... Fun, Creepy movie to immerse yourself in -- on a late weekend night. Psychological thriller, macabre, nightmarish. Did ""not"" view the original version."
2,Argh! Frustration...,"I bought this video to show to some high school German students. Unfortunately, the words displayed on the screen are in English, not German. I didn't see any information about that before I ordered -- just assumed since it was a GERMAN movie, the text would be in German."
4,A Creepy Classic,"Long recognized for its style in bizarre expressionism, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is an excellent example of creepy chills in the silent cinema. Newly tinted, with a solid musical score and informative film commentary, this DVD version is a must have for any film student....or even if you want to curl up by the fire and thrill to this tale of the sinister sleepwalker and the mad doctor......or is he mad? Find out for yourself. Highly recommended."
5,Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"One of the finest achievements of the silent era and in some ways an allegory of Weimar Germany's decadent demise, Wiene's ""Caligari"" is an eerie, heavily stylized horror film. With its distorted angles, chiaroscuro lighting, and jarring German expressionist sets, the film is a striking precursor not only to Lang's ""Metropolis,"" but to the look and atmospheric feel of 1940s American noir. And its tale of a crazed doctor and his zombie-like proxy introduced a basic template for many later horror features. Still creepy and lurid after eighty-five years, ""Caligari"" will cast a spell on you."
4,A review from the 'target audience'...,"I got the book about a week ago, and was pleased at such an easy read.. and I got it for 4.97, hardcover at that. It was WELL worth my money. I am, for the interested, a 16 year old male. And like many have said, it reads like a comic.. which is what it originally was. I'm an alien buff, and astrology guy, and a computer geek... this book was me. Some people will not like, but then again some people didn't like 'The Hobbit'. In my opinion, if you dig comic plots that run high on the 'techno-modern' side (X-Men, Spawn, etc.), are into aliens, and want a book you can put away in a week easy... this is it. I eagerly await a sequel."
5,A truly distinguished goth-pop album! The best!,"A friend gave me a copy of this album overtaped on a used cassette in Madrid, Spain in 1991. I listened to it for years wondering if I would ever come across their albums (before the days of internet). Now, needless to say, I have this on CD as well as 8 other releases by this amazing band. This is their finest. It is gothic pop at its best and will chill your spine and make you dance at the same time. For fans of New Order, Joy Division, Bauhaus, etc.. These guys get it done in a different way but there is a connection. If you are even only a mild fan of BritPop, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection. It is as stunning a debut as the Stone Roses' first album. I'm not kidding! Proceed to checkout!"
5,My favorite album of all time,"I first heard this album when I was in the Air Force stationed in the Netherlands in the mid 80's. Some of the guys I was stationed with were listening to it and thought it was great. I went out and bought it because I liked the song 'Up the Down Escalator'. Slowly over time I listened to more and more songs on the album until I got to the point where I liked every song on it. There is no other album I own where I listen to the whole thing on a regular basis. I just can't tell you how much I love this album.I decided to write this review after reading the other reviews posted here. I knew I loved it but didn't know anyone else who even knew who this band was. It made me feel good to know that there were other people out there who feel the same as I do. If I was going to be stranded on a deserted island and could only bring one cd with me, this would be the one."
1,Incredibly disappointed,"I started reading this after just finishing Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Farmer in the Sky. I thought he could do no wrong. One of the negative reviews said it was more like pornography than science fiction. Since I didn't plan to read it with anyone, this even further intrigued me. This book not only fails as pornography, it fails as science fiction. Since the main character spends most of his(her?) time in the same room with inner monologue, it might as well be the chronicles of someone in a mental institution. It is a great concept for a book, but I'm afraid I'll have to find another author who knows how to deliver.I do plan on reading more Heinlein but it'll be a while. If you're on a Heinlein kick, save this one for last if you even bother."
5,Love it,A super weird different kind of romance with a twist. Not the usual kind of story or even love triangle!
2,What could this have been?,"What could this have been had RAH been well enough to edit and rewrite it? As most fans know, Heinlein suffered periods of sickness. I think this time it was peritonitis, but I am not really sure. He did not get to edit or rewrite to his standards, and it shows. What you are reading is one of his rough drafts, not a finished product. That makes a big difference, and for that reason, I can't really recommend this except to die-hards. However I am surprised at the number of people who are not die-hards who seem to enjoy it. I would just hate for this to be someone's first or second experience with this wonderful author. May I suggest Citizen of the Galaxy? Time Enough for Love? Even To Sail Beyond the Sunset? This should be one of the last books Heinlein competists like myself should read."
5,One of the best books of Heinlein!,This is just GREAT book! Try to read this. Beleive me you'lllike it!
2,Heinlein's biggest fan,"I had never read a Heinlein I didn't like. Even when, starting with ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" he quit writing for children and started writing for adults, I made the transition (I was 12 that year) and forced my tastes to grow up right along with his stories. 45 years later, I liked ""For Us, the Living,"" which is more of a rough draft of an unpublished novel than an actual book. I even liked ""Variable Star,"" although it frequently loses Mr. Heinlein's voice in Mr. Robinson's.I DON'T LIKE "" I Will Fear No Evil.""It is too long, it drags, and it is, ultimately, plain ol' boring, despite a fascinating well-developed premise.Too bad. But it is really the only dog he ever wrote, so read it once, and then go back to the rest of his truly brilliant ouevre."
4,Excellent Information,"I've actually had the chance to train with Matt Thomas, and his work is amazing. The book could certainly use better photos, and the reviewer who suggested a DVD is right-on. Of course, even Matt will tell you, there's no replacement for hands-on training. Please seek it out for yourself and the women in your lives."
2,not my cup o' tea,"You may have read reviews or comments about this somewhat controversial CD, that the performance of the Enigma Variations is eccentric, willful, wrong-headed or ill-conceived. Having purchased it out of curiosity I'm inclined to agree. It's a slowish reading that doesn't seem to cohere, centered by a marathon ""Nimrod"" that just...does...not...work. I often love Lenny when he's ""bad,"" but this is really bad. Boult and Barbirolli achieved 10 times as much in half the time."
3,Total surprise,"If you use windows XP you are in luck. This is a great program and does not bog down your computer like the Norton Anti Virus software. However if you own a New PC with Windows Vista....Beware. It says windows Vista compatable. NOT!! You need to make sure you go on line first and download what is necessary to make the program work on the Windows Vista PC's. The instructions do not tell you to do that and if you are as unlucky as myself, you to will spend another $130.00 having your PC restored after Trend Micro wipes it out.....Trend Micro Support was of no help resolving my problems with the unfortunate download...Good Luck."
1,Huge drag on system resources,"I have this installed on two systems at home...both are running XP, but one of them is a couple years old and is a little slower than the newer one. Both computers have a large amount of RAM. Before installing this software, both computers were decently responsive, with the newer computer being blazing fast.Now that this is installed, both have slowed down, especially the older computer. But even the newer one is noticeably slower, which seems to be common complaint as I read the other reviews and google this product.I keep reading that Kapersky or AVG are better -- I think when my subscription expires I will try one of those. In the meantime, if I were you, I'd keep looking. (And I feel compelled to mention that I have no financial or other interest in computers or software so I consider myself an unbiased reviewer, just trying to help others in the amazon community!)"
2,Bogged System Down,"I installed this product in mid-June and my system instantly bogged down. From boot up to internet access, everything slowed to a crawl. I finally uninstalled this about 10 minutes ago just to see what would happen and it was like a speed switch being flipped to ""on"". Going to follow one reviewer's advice and reinstall the 2006 version."
1,Resource-intensive and bloated,"I had great expectations for this software given the positive reviews it had received from some publications. It was a great disappointment upon installation to discover the amount of resources it consumes in a resting state. In my case, almost 250 mb of RAM is constantly being used by the various scans that it performs regularly. Additionally, upon installation it is very difficult to permanently change the protection profile, and even turning off certain features does not free the resources. Only recommended if you have 2 gig of RAM installed. And even then, be prepared for a noticable impact on everyday performance and substantially longer boot times."
1,Trend Micro PC Cillin,"Do not buy this product. If you feel you must, buy it from Trend Micro website or you will not have a warranty. I bought Trend Micro Internet Security Pro 2008 from Best Buy. It would lock up during a scan. After many attempts at getting service I ask for my money back. Trend Micro said they would not refund on a store product. Best Buy would not refund an opened product. So I am out $70.00. And they are still sending emails with no solution to the problem. I have ask them to stop sending emails but they are still comming. Worse than a virus."
1,What?? The truth behind the best selling Novel?,"I am disappointed by this book. I was expecting a scholar to deliver us some facts and real information, but he seemed to be a novice when it comes to writing a book. Throughout this book, he was hung-up on proving Dan Brown wrong, and that what actually put me off from the book, because his persistent argument looked one sided and personal . It looks like a mere platform to settle a personal thing, than to actually provide readers with correct information. Even if what he says is right, he just delivered it so badly in quest of bringing Dan Brown down, that he actually moved away from the very motive behind writing this book. Or may be that was his only motive! If you have to read it, buy a second hand copy."
3,Read the CASE FOR CHRIST.,"What I find interesting in ""The Case for Christ"" is that it is unbiased which pleases non-Christian Readers. It addresses many of the same issues in Abanes book.If you want a strictly systematic approach to proving whether or not Jesus' life, death, and ressurection were truth, you'll find this book fascinating."
3,The truth Behind The DA VINCI CODE,"Good If you do not know the mesning of fiction. The DA VINCI CODE is fiction. If you do not know this, then this book is for you."
5,Pure Magic,"Good dialogue, wonderfully crafted story.Protagonist is a girl, but boys love it, too. I read it at age 12, and again read it aloud to my kids when they were 8 and 10 years old."
3,The Morgue,My husband and I plus my daughter have read the Morgue. It held our interest right up until the end. Dennis Griffin has all the right credentials of becoming a well known writer. We look forward to his next novel.
3,Bug in the box,Cute but the timing is a little off for the pop up feature. It is a jack in the box with a bug instead of the jester. Cute idea the kids liked the color changing top much better.
5,Spiritual Fusion.,"Though this Cd might be harder to get now that it is unavailable in the US, go to outside sources and buy it. A very strong Spiritual Latin Jazz fusion packed with numerous artist of the highest caliber. I could not find anything wrong with any of the tracks here on this Cd, Carlos again proves why he has taken so many by the heart and given so much back to his fans through his music. in taking to his brother Jorge Santana I had asked him what his all time favorite song of his brother was, he stated to me that it has to be (Yours Is The Light). Now on that alone I would recomend this Cd to anyone and everyone but when you here this Cd in its entirerty you will agree and be glad that you did not miss out on another beautiful creation by this legend artist. Peace in Music.."
3,What a let down!,"Okay, not only is this DVD lacking some of the better skits (any of the CKY stuff with Bam and Phil, the egg-eating contest, etc) they included some of the lamer skits like the metallic suit, beard of leeches, and Gumball 2000. Seriously lacking and let's not mention the edited scenes, this DVD was promised to show ""what MTV wouldn't allow on air"". The only skit I hadn't seen on MTV was the omelette, or should I say Vomelette. All in all, still entertaining, but a real big let-down for this Jackass fan. Buy the CKY box set instead!"
5,reason for no volume 1.,there's probably not a volume one cause half the stuff from season one came off of CKY videos.
3,dissapointing,"1. its edited. and that simply .... i mean, lets think about it, only true true fans of jackass would spend $$ on dvds of episodes still airing on tv correct? WELL GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. i was in awe when the first ... word was a long bleep. NOT COOL PARAMOUNT AND MTV.. NOT COOL.2. there are less than half the episodes. they cut out so many funny skits. including the meter fairy, daddy and baby, dog vs. bunny (pontius), wrecking ball, they cut blindfolded skateboarding in half completely forgeting the funny part. human bbq.. please man that was classic and they didn't include it. the videos are only like 75 minutes each. and huge dissapointment and rip off.3. no gumball rally. even though it wasn't that funny, it truly marked the end of jackass. and, guess what, it's not included. imagine that.overall, i gave it 3 stars, because what i'm forced to deal with is great. but im severly dissapointed. oh well. maybe i'll find all the epsidoes somewhere. like a true fan should."
5,Lite weight & powerful,"I have a supply of eucalyptus fire wood. I use the whole tree. When I cut the branches I cut to length from 1/4"" Dia. on up. I bought these loppers to save mysaw. Why waste it on the small cut's? I cut all the small stuff up to about 1 1/2"" with the loppers. I have been using them for about 4 month's, and they still go through 1 1/2"" seasoned eucalyptus with no trouble. I don't stress themany more then that. They have saved ware on my saw, and have saved me allot of time. I have never used the Corona compound with the geared blade. If anything ever happens to these I might give them a try. I think I made a very good buy."
5,It Simply works,"I just bought a new desktop and it came with no IDE, so I had a problem with my 250Gb IDE HDD which I didn't wanted to put on an USB box, but to use it as a secondary drive, so I bought one of these converters and problem solved, not only I'm using the drive on my new desktop it also increased it's transfer rate."
1,Didn't work with new Dell system,"I'm also running Microsoft Media Center and had no luck with the converter. I attached it to my older Western Digital IDE hard drive, plugged it into the second SATA slot on the motherboard, and poof, nothing. Not only did it not allow my system to recognize the older drive, but when I used it, my system couldn't recognize the exisiting SATA drive! I tried every possible jumper configuration for the IDE drive, and nothing helped. I'm no hardware genius, but I built my last two machines without trouble, so I'm pretty sure I connected everything correctly. Furthermore, I researched the Intel Matrix Storage Manager issue listed in comments above, and although I'm not sure if my system is running it, Intel's site recommends against using SATA converters like this if it is running.OOPS: I just found out that my IDE hard drive had gone bad (circuit board is dead), so please ignore the above. I have no idea whether the converter works or not."
3,For USA only!,"This book is a great job. This is a kind of encyclopedia of home businesses. You can really find how to select, start, manage, market, and multiply the profits of business at home. But almost all the reference information ablolutely useless outside the United States. Maybe, for foreigners from all over the globe this Barbara Brabec's book is an inspirational guide to dare to create your own home business. But for the first you need to collect extra corresponding reference information for your local country -- on law, banks, accounts, bookkeeping and so on."
4,"Wonderful mouse, OK keyboard, good overall",A gyroscopic mouse takes a few hours to get used to but once you get the concept it is very simple to operate. I use it for HTPC so ability to operate without desktop surface is very useful. The keyboard is somewhat small. Keys are smaller than IBM Thinkpad keys. The small keyboard size works very well for HTPCs.When I installed a receiver station and trained with a keyboard only it was giving missing keys problem (the same as for one of the reviewers). As soon as I trained a mouse AND a keyboard problem disappeared completely and keyboard did not give a single failure or missing key.Overall a very good package with attractive price.I was considering two new Logitech Bluetooth keyboard/mouse suites but choose Gyration due to a mouse that can be operated in the air. No regrets so far.Computer professionals would not like location of the left Ctrl key. It is next to Fn key in the left bottom corner. The same as in Thinkpad laptops.
1,Worst Wireless Duo Ever......Should Be Rated 0,"Do not buy this product, its the worst wireless duo ever....for the last 10 years, I had used Logitech. Microsoft & Kensington wireless Keyboard and Mouse, they all about equal except for design and software features...but this one...Gyration Trash...mouse is too slow. keyboard keep on disconnecting, you need to reconnect or use the learn bottom at least once a week....drive me crazy...its a pair of trash."
4,Works!,I have tried everything including a steroid. This stuff works really good! I'd rather not mention where I have the problem but it worked in a few days!
1,Warning: Oxipor not returnable to Amazon.com!!!,"I changed my mind about purchasing this item. When I tried to start the retrun process and print a return label, Amazon.com said:""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.""I don't know about you, but I don't have $28 to throw away. It seems to me that Amazon.com should have put some kind of notice or warning that this product is non-returnable, even if it's unopened / unused. That was just irresponsible for them to not do so."
3,buy only if you know nothing about Tai Chi,I was a little disappointed in this video. I expected a lot more exercises not just the two sets.buy it if you don't know anything about Tai Chi. The instructor is delightful and a pleasure to watch. I just wish it contained more.
3,Keep listening...,"This would be a really good record for anybody, but this isn't ANYBODY,it's Marvin Gaye. When Marvin Gaye is really doing his thing, he reachesan incredible level of emotional communication, as demonstrated by Live, the London Palladium show and the Washington D.C. concert that makes up the 2nd disc of the expanded What's Going On. If you really want to understand what makes Marvin Gaye so incredible you need to dig deep the 60's hits and the 70's concept albums and THEN check outthe man delivering it live. I enjoy this album, but if you want to experience the ""live"" Marvin Gaye, you really owe it to him and yourself to keep listening to him...elsewhere!"
2,Keith Urban Fantastic,"It was just not what I had expected, two women and not just one telling about what I had hoped would have been the psychic self defense I was hoping, instead it was more about constructing alters in different places in your home and less about rituals. I don't want to nake a crazy alter with the stuff she came up with. It just would not be something I would have gotten had I known more about the contents. One person to listen to would have been enough."
5,Capturing a soul in descent,"Huysmans' Durtal, the main character in this and 'The Cathedral', was an autobiographical character to many degrees. As such, he was able to capture with such vivid imagery that of a man fascinated with the lives of monsters (Gilles De Rais in particular), and only slowly becoming aware of his descent into hardcore, introspective reality. Though his life is full of dinner table coonversations and interesting people, he, himself cannot avoid the ultimate conclusion that his complete dissassociation and overanalyzation of his emotion has left him without a soul. Nothing is of value but the sinful imagination which, in his mind, is so built up that nothing in reality can ever match the dream. Heavy stuff for one to contend with. A warning, this book can make you re-evaluate your own life and make you pose a question: Are your priorities out of whack?"
3,Interesting,"This is a study of Satanism is the 19th century. The focus is on a bloke who is doing some research into Gilles de Rais. Much of the book is rather dull, and it does contaon some good information, but it tells one less about Satansim and more about one maniac than some believe. Also fascinating is the emphasis placed on ""decadence"" in art and literature. The Bell-rigner was an interesting character as well. Some of the scenes of the Black Mass were amusing, but all in all I wasn't that impressed. The style of Huysmans, however, I liked considerably. For a more realistic look at Satansim, one would do better to consult some of LaVey's work."
2,"Good shipping, bad book.",I had no problems with the vendor. It was a good price and I needed it for class so I was thrilled when it came in early. But the story itself wasn't something I'd read on my own or ever again.
3,PASS ME THE PEACE PIPE.....I'M CONFUSED!,"I don't know what to think after reading this book. I don't know what kind of review to write after reading this book. The story jumps around a lil' bit from one thing to another and then blends back together again at different points in the story. This book in a way reminded me of ""The Catcher In The Rye"" which I also had high expectations for and was at last dissapointed with."
1,hated it,"Politically correct fiction written by in the 60's by a Native American, about a Native American who has trouble re-adapting to life in the U.S. after coming back from WWII. Guess whose values turn out to be far superior?Unfortunately, the narrator gets into peyote. The author chose to embody this in the form of dramatically shifting narrative styles, something that makes the book hard to follow.Also a very heavy Hemingway influence. Basically it's what you get when you cross Hemingway, Timothy Leary, and Chief Bromden and have nothing deeper to say than ""American culture seems materialistic."""
2,Vinyl sink.,"WHOOPS!-- I used this sink a second time several months later after some storage, it had lost its rigidity completely. Now it will only hold a little bit of water but wants to continually collapse. I am adjusting my rating, this sink stinks."
1,a fellow tonfa practitioner,If you are new to the tonfa I would recommend reading Fumia Demura's book Tonfa: Karate Weapon of Self-Defense. If you are all ready familiar with the weapon then you may enjoy Robert Clark's book Traditional Kobujutsu.
4,beauty songs but scarse lyrics,i loved tina charles few weeks ago i got a cd from her buit only 2 lyrics i got by interet by now.hope get more.
5,Many activities for a variety of developmental stages.,As a Preschool teacher this book brought many ideas into my classroom. So far the children have responded positively to all literary activities used. Definetly a book that will be on my shelf for a long time.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The study guide is somewhat useful (but still contains inaccurate information not addressed in the errata that used to be found on the publisher's web site), but the book of sample test questions was a complete waste of money - see my review under the practice test book.My attempts to contact the publisher to get an up to date listing of errata was not at all satisfying.If you want books that more accurately represent the material that is actually on the CompTIA Network+ exam, I recommend the Network+ Exam Cram and Exam Prep books, and the Network+ Certification for Dummies book (in that order)."
4,Excellent,This is a very good book for the Network + Exam. It was the only study guide I used and I passed the test the first time. The test questions helped very much. It modeled the actual exam 100%. It is the only book you will need if you want to become Network + certified. I reccomend this book.
4,Wuzzzzzzzzzzzup,This book was really good. If you like mystery books this is one. But it has a really bad ending.The beginning of this it is 5 stars but in the end it is about 1 star. I would give this 1 star for boring. I would recommend this book to people who like some action and likes mystery.
5,Good,"I was very happy with my purchase. It came in a very timely manner, was not damaged, and the packaging was good."
2,Pathetic index; just pathetic,"There is a lot of good information in this book, but good luck finding it. What on earth was the publisher/editor thinking of by allowing this book with this exceedingly weak index to go to press. Michelin, you should be ashamed of yourself. Really.Dog eared pages is the only way relocate anything you may have read earlier without paging through dozens of pages. A real pain as you're zooming through the Provence countryside. Nevertheless, there is decent information in the book."
5,Best $39 I ever spent!,"I LOVE my Floppy Seat! My daughter and I go out to the store (grocery store, discount stores, etc.) practically daily, and we use our Floppy Seat in every shopping cart. We also use it in restaurant high chairs. A wonderful product. She will sleep in it, etc. We definitely use the built in seat belt so that she won't be tempted to crawl out when in a grocery cart. I am not sure why another reviewer had a problem with her child falling out while using the Floppy Seat."
5,GREATEST!! MUST BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!,This product is honestly a lifesaver! I use it almost everyday and never worry about my daughter putting her mouth on any of the handles of the shopping carts anymore! Not a shopping trip goes buy that I am not asked where I bought my seat cover. If you saw the 60 minutes expose on how filthy shopping cart handles are you would know just how much you need this item. I will never go shopping without it again!
5,A must-have no one told you you had to have...,"At 8-months, when my daughter wouldn't stop trying to chew the seat belt and bar on grocery store carts, I started using a blanket. Soon enough she figured out how to wiggle out of the blanket and began throwing it out of the cart and on the store floors, rendering the blanket useless. The floppy seat makes her more comfortable, has it's own safety belt, and completely dispels the germ issues associated with shopping carts. It even provides her a pocket to store her pacifier (when she so chooses!). I can't recommend this item enough!"
1,Not impressed,"I purchased this Floppy seat to use for my 10 month old daughter. From the positive reviews on this site along with price, I decided to buy it. But the first time I tried putting it on the shopping cart, I found it quite difficult to get on. One side kept popping off while I tried to get the other side on.I was very disappointed as some of the reviews people gave about this product are simply not true. At least from my experience. I ended up taking the Floppy seat back & purchasing a slightly more expensive cart cover that was there. I am extremely happy with the other cover I purchased. The Floppy seat did not live up to it's reviews & I was not impressed. I guess you get what you pay for these days."
1,Watch out!!!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely loved the floppy seat until today. My 14 month old son some how fell out of the shopping cart with the floppy seat still attached (it was attached properly, I use the floppy seat at least 5xs a week). I had one hand on the cart and was reaching for crackers with the other. I had my eye off him for one second to reach the shelf. The floppy seat and my son landed on the grocery store floor. Luckily he just has a bump on his head. I do not recomend this product, I believe it gives a false sense of security. If you use this seat please just remember my story and never take your eye off your baby."
3,it's ok,"I looked into a lot of other similar products before I purchased this one, and it's just ok. Sometimes it's more of a pain to use it than it's worth, being so floppy and large. It's a lot of work to put on the shopping cart if you're just running in for a minute, but you have to be the judge of whether or not you're child's health is worth the time and struggle. I feel silly bringing such a huge cover in restaurants, but it seems comfortable for my son and it does an awesome job of protecting him against germs."
2,EZ carry not so EASY,I found this product to be extremely bulky. It is hard to maneuver by yourself in the store. I had a very difficult time holding my 8 month old and trying to assemble the seat cover into the grocery cart. I would not recommend this product and have found it easier to carry antibacterial wipes in my purse and wipe down the carts and baby seats available in shopping carts. I found this to be a royal waste of money!!
1,Disappointing CD,The performance was disappointing. I barely recognized the pieces that were standards.
3,Alfonso Cuaron's bleak vision of a future without children,"Apocalyptic film about a world with no children. Even England, the last bastion of civilisation, is slipping into choas.Cuaron's vision of the future is memorable but the plot is less interesting. Features some extraordinary visual effects - this film goes a long way on a modest budget - but his use of the hand-held camera is relentless. Might have made a better video game than a movie. Ends abruptly. And what exactly is the point?"
2,Poor quality film,"The story is unusual and needs more explanation in the film. Why did every woman on earth stop having babies? The firearms skirmishes were the only excellent part of this film.My major gripe ... the film quality is very grainy on DVD and I was hugely disappointed with this - the film looks very poor on our large LCD TV, even using an SD DVD Oppo upscaler.Overall, I think they should have cut a better quality picture on DVD. This ruins the film and no .... I'm not rushing out like a good little punter to get an HD system. So the ploy failed. If this was supposed to be ""creatively"" poor quality film, then the Director should reserve this kind of work for art studios and friends, not mass market."
1,Stupid and Has Lousy Ending,"I had fairly high expectations for this movie. It seemed like it might be interesting.Im glad I saved my money from going to see it at the theater. I'm out $2 from the video store. Thats $1 more than it was worth.I was very dissapointed in the movie. The story was just plain bizarre. It didn't seem to flow very well. Characters that you would have expected to have larger parts, die, early on. It did not seem very well thought out.After wondering about this so called ""Human Project"" thing the whole movie, we are left hanging at the end as to what it really is.I should have got the penguin movie instead......."
1,Doesn't play in XBox360 HD DVD player,"The movie's great, but this wouldn't play in my HD DVD player. Other HD DVD titles I've got play just fine, but not this one. Given that fact, I'm inclined to think it's this title that has the problem (although, I guess I can never rule out the XBox360 HD DVD player having quirks). The only thing that kept it being a 0 rating is that side B has the DVD formatted version, so I at least can watch the movie."
2,Not worth the money,after finishing the movie i felt like i wasted my money. The movie was boring and had no real plot to keep me interested through out the whole movie. i had to watch it and pause because it was boring enough that i could not watch it at one.
2,Horrible,I give this film an extra star because it was made really well and I like the actors. But it's like millionaires invested to see my best friend roll around naked on a floor full of broken glass for two hours. Then I was dumb enough to give them money to reimburse the expenses.
2,boring movie,I had heard so much about this movie and then rented it only to find it was totally boring and not at all what I expected. A real who gives a #*! movie! Don't waste your time.
5,Definitely in my top five,"I was thrilled to take a speculative fiction class at UC Berkeley and find that this film was among those assigned as homework (along with ""Gattaca"" and ""Bladerunner""). There are a few films that I will watch repeatedly and this is one. There is a rawness and harshness to the imagery, dialogue and at times, music. All of it blends well together in my opinion. I catch more and more symbolism each time I watch it ... the barn scene, the mention of high pitch noise that eventually fades (and later when the audio of a high pitch note coincides with a particular scene). There is much to catch while watching this movie and therein lies the beauty.If you are curious about whether you will like this movie or not, rather then telling you my favorite movies, I suggest you give it a try. Like reality, it is beautiful, dark, moving, raw, ugly and harsh."
5,Absolutely one of the best movies ever made,"Funny moments. Novel plot. Excellent action. Flawless cinematography. Seriously, there's an action scene thats about 10 minutes long that's a single cut. And the story line is not centered around a romantic relationship or just general blood-lust! I don't know why every review of this isn't 5 stars."
3,Scandinavian Import with no extras,"Children of Men is a surprisingly well done movie, with good set design, a good script, good acting, and high production values. It is a cinematic gem whose reputation is likely to grow over time.That is all I will say about the movie itself, because the primary purpose of this particular review is more limited: to let people know about the Blu Ray that Amazon sent me.I received a Scandinavian import. While the quality of the picture was good, the opening screen was simply for the viewer to choose which of four languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and Finnish) the subtitles would be in (luckily it was not dubbed but was in English). There were no extras that I could find, so it is truly a bare bones Blu Ray. As a result, I was disappointed with the Blu-Ray even though I like the movie itself very well. Caveat emptor, folks."
1,Pointless and boring nonsense.,"This movie is boring, pointless, awful, ugly. Stupid story and stupid film. So the little black girl gets pregnant to carry on the human race? Is that supposed to be ironic?And why did other girls not get pregnant? They used birth control and she didn't?How lucky for her to become another Eve!""The Handmaid's Tale"" by M. Atwood deals with a similar premise but is a great novel and was made into a great film.The book by P.D. James is crap and so is the movie."
3,WTF?,"POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!I liked the movie all the way through but the end? WTF? Did they run out of film? I don't understand, what was the point, whats the score here, what comes next? I mean I liked every bit of it but when the credits rolled I was left like a deer in the headlights, Almost as if someone cut out the last 5 minutes of the film from my mind so thats how the movie seemed to me, like it was missing an ending. Maybe thats just me, but whatever."
2,An Exercise in Poor Film-Making,"This is at best, a good book turned into a very slow, tepid, and clueless film. We are supposed to care that people can't get pregnant anymore, and then one woman emerges pregnant, and the entire film focusses on getting her to safety so that she can deliver her baby.On paper, this is interesting, and yes, I have to give credit to the director for making a deep, hued film of a certain texture. However, you cannot get past the very weak casting, as well as the extremely useless ending. I never once cared for any of these characters, and am I really the only person who cannot for the life of me understand all of these five star reviews?""Children of Men"" is a very poor 'futuristic' drama. This is a movie that is definitely overrated, and I am sorry I wasted time on it. Next time, I'd trust my own judgement rather than these 5 star reviews on Amazon."
1,Very dissapointed in film,"I was pretty excited to see this movie, but was hugely disappointed.Read the review a few reviews down entitled ""Wasted premise ... narrow focus on modern politics instead""...and that is how I feel about this movie, pretty much. It lacked a purpose in every aspect of the movie. We're hardly aware of what's going on most of the time, we don't know what the Human Project is, we don't know why women are infertile, we don't know why the government is sending all immigrants out of the country, we don't know the ""hows"" or ""whys"" of anything. All we see is desperation and violence with no purpose or meaning.Granted, the cinematography is quite well done. But I can see well done composition in a photograph. This is a movie, it was supposed to tell a story...with a beginning and an end. And hopefully a point. But alas, this movie lacks all of the above."
2,Good Cinematography and big stars do not a great film make.,"Here I amagain. I just don't get it. This movie had no real character develepment, and no assemblance of storytelling whatsoever. Not to mention an illegal immigration agenda. I heard so many good things about this and when I managed to get through it (which was a task in and of itself) I was like ""what the hell was that?"" I guess I'm just not enlightened enough. Stupid movie don't waste your time."
2,Most Overrated Movie Ever!,"I had wanted to see this movie when it was first released in theaters but didn't have time. Based on reviews I had read, I thought it would be a great film. After watching this movie, I am greatly dissappointed. To say that it was just boring would be too kind. It was also very depressing. I suppose some could say it's thought provoking and the acting is good, but it's still boring. If it weren't for the occasional explosion and gunshot,I would have fallen asleep several times. Luckily, I only wasted 99 centson it during the special sale last weekend. Don't waste your time or money on this yawn fest."
5,A Roller Coaster Through Battered Europe,"What an amazing film. The film open with the sad and shocking state of humanity, which is that we cannot concieve. No children have been born for 20 years, and civilisation is in tatters, with London holding on by becoming a facist state. The story here is overwhelming at times and extemely moving later. The cinematoraphy is top notch. Watch this film."
5,The way we were/are/may be,"Children of Men is one of those rare apocalyptic movies that stimulates apprehension from the first frame. I can't say that watching it was an enjoyable or entertaining experience for me. It sets up a depressingly filthy, hopeless world that makes you want to drench yourself under a hot shower. Visually stunning, atmospherically bleak, teetering on the edge of terror, Children certainly makes its point with undeniable force and immediacy. It was only a day or so after seeing this film that I felt comfortable thinking about it. Terse, well directed, with performances effective because of their restraint, in Children of Men Alfonso Cuaron gives us a graphic version of the way we might become because of the way we were and are. Humanity can use more visions (nightmares) like this one to bring reality to the stream of warnings that flow through the daily news on a depressingly regular basis. Not fun to watch, but should not be ignored because of that."
3,Children of Men - Synopsis and Review,"The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis:The near future finds us with no more children; infertility plagues humankind. Britain has become a military state and deportation of illegal immigrants is a top priority. A woman appears promising an optimistic future but no one knows what exactly to do with her promise.Review:The premise of the movie is fantastic. Unfortunately the movie is more about the military state, its' pogrom against illegals and the ensuing rebellion than it is an exploration of a world without children. It shirks its' science fiction obligation to ask puzzling questions and satisfies itself with a feature length chase scene through a dystopia. In spite of the missed opportunities this created world is a fascinating place to watch the action take place. I think most will find the movie somewhat unsatisfying but it is still worth a watch."
3,A WORLD WITHOUT BABIES,"Alfonso Cuaron's treatment of P.D. James futuristic novel is a stylish exercise, a cautionary tale filmed with professional care and finesse, but it's also a dark, violent story with no resolve or emotional satisfaction.It's 2027 in England, in a world where a child hasn't been born in twenty years...why we're never told, but it is a world replete with revolutionary uprisings and unflinching bias.Clive Owen plays Theo, a young man who is approached by a former lover, who is now a ""terrorist"" (Julianne Moore in a very surprisingly brief appearance) to help her smuggle a young pregnant girl to safety. Double crosses and tragedy ensue. Michael Caine steals his scenes as a kind of ""hippie"" friend who aids and abets. While visually stunning and well acted, the movie isn't as satisfying as one would expect and it's grim outlook is rather unsettling although provocative."
1,TERRIBLE - Can't understand all these great reviews!,"I don't want to give away the story or anything for those who will watch this, but the movie is boring... Nothing happens, and nothing gets resolved in the end. Seriously one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. :("
1,Really slow and dreary,"This film had been highly recommended. I found it slow, depressing and the ""stunning visuals"" not worth watching. The story line was neither original or interesting. I've watched it twice hoping to find something worth praising, but found nothing. If you're into really depressing films hyped as ""realistic"" this is for you."
3,read the warning label,The subsitute for sugar has some interesting side effects that will prevent me from purchasing the candy.
1,How far is too far in what we give our kids?,"Perhaps this toy might indulge a child's imagination, but it could give the child an inner signal that torching a human being is an okay thing to do. Maybe we should think about how to discourage violence and self-immolation, rather than possibly furthering the ideas that it is culturally acceptable to set oneself on fire, to blow oneself up, or to torch any human being or animal. I did not buy the product, but saw the ad and was appalled."
4,one of the funniest books ever!,"Not high art, but SOOOOO funny! I loved it as a kid, my son loves it now...and I still find it laugh out loud hilarious."
4,Polder chrome wall shelf,"Product is sturdy and comes with all the needed parts (including those needed for hanging in challenging environments) for assembly and hanging. Did have a couple of small pitted spots on the bars. Would have loved to get this product in a polished nickel finish. Would have also liked to purchase additional bathroom accessory items to match, i.e.; toothbrush holder, soap dish, toilet paper holder, and possibly a small (12-18 inch) and or larger towel bar."
3,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for","This was the cheapest yet largest towel rack of this style I could find on Amazon. It looks good and goes together easily, but the design is just flawed. You have all of the weight of your towels concentrated on one point, the single screw in the back. So over time the top shelf will sag. It's a pain to tighten the screws too since you have to completely remove the shelf from the wall to do so. When I did take it apart, I used loctite on the threads and tightened them as much as I could without risking stripping out the threads, but over time it still started sagging a bit.For most people, it would be fine, but I built my whole bathroom myself and I'm picky so it bothers me. But for the money I guess it's ok, although a simple corner bracket would do wonders for this design."
3,Great at first... but ...,"Was a little nervous that this was going to be flimsy however, as i put screws in the rack stiffened up and now i have no worries that it will hold all that i have to put on it. I don't think this will last forever, noticed a couple little bubbles in the chrome coating, but what can you expect for so little money.UPDATE: After some time with this the top support has started to strip from the screws and is no longer secure. Some of this I amount to my dumb roommates stacking a ton of wet towels up there, i think the shelf would be great for TP or a few wash clothes but not much more than that. Also, the coating has started to come of and the whole thing is starting to rust (not very nice looking)"
2,Wobbly & Short Life Span.,"Ours came apart after light residential use, approx. 24 months or so from date of installation...the bars are not particularly secure. We recommend a model with better soldering."
5,"Practical, simple, effective. Every word is valuable.","If you want to be in control of your life this is an excellent beginning. This book is special and different from all relaxation books I've ever read. It's easy to notice that the author has experienced everything he teaches, making it very practical, yet comprehensive. The text is focused, clear and objective, so that you can easily work on the causes of your stress, anxiety, fear or unhappiness. It's impressive!!!"
2,It's not worth the price,"Ok, the package is gorgeous. But little else.The gem here are CD's 3 and four, BEAST OVER HAMMERSMITH. The sound, the performance, the set list (it's practically a ""Best Of"" their first three albums), everything is top notch. And this perfection is also a problem!! Why?Because, listening to how good this live set is, you will notice how weak, really, are all other live albums by Maiden. You'll notice how the drumming by Clive Burr was much more powerful, precise, loud and creative than that of Nicko. You'll notice how all the live albums with Janick Gers are crap.The B-Sides are interesting, but already own most of them. The first yeasrs recording are just a curiosity, unless you really feel pleasure by listening to ""Iron Maiden"" 5 times...."
4,Enjoyable disagreement,"Since Chesterton and Shaw so vehemently disagreed with each other on many topics, one would expect this quick text to be filled with antagonism. Instead, it is a delightful explanation of Shaw's background, biography and beliefs, told in a gentle, light-hearted manner. Chesterton shows a great respect for his adversary, while making clear his own views through quite a few of the one-sentence quotables for which he is well known."
1,"Slow, Weak, and Tedious","Although it sports a first rate cast, a brilliant score, and premiere production values, the film version of ""The Wiz"" is about as slow as molasses in a hard freeze on the high plains. The celebrated stars, particularly Ross and Jackson, deliver surprisingly weak performances which drag the film to a near standstill, and the director lacks any real feeling for the surreal fantasy of the material; even more surprising, the film traffics in a weird sort of covert racism of imagery which stereotypes the all-black cast in a way which the stage production does not. One gets the feeling that every one involved gritted their teeth with steely determination to make a classic; in consequence, the only thing which emerges on the screen is gritted teeth. Instead of buying or renting the film, order a copy of the Broadway soundtrack, which shows you what a sparkler the show really is."
3,The Wiz,The original Classic was so much better!!This was pretty good.Nothing compares to the REAL Wizard Of Oz!Why even try?
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Film,"Aside from this DVD not being 16:9 and including zero extras, the film itself is extremely boring, the songs or terribly written and witless, and the acting is the pits and pathetically miscast in almost every department (outside of Michael Jackson who does a brilliant job). The only ""hits"" from the show on more chants than songs, I would much rather watch The Apple or Xanadu or eat live rodents than have to suffer through this again."
1,"Stick with the original, this version stinks!","The original Wizard of Oz, is a true classic. This black version is absolutely horrendous! The only reason I watched it at all, is because Michael Jackson was in it. As incredible an entertainer as he is, he couldn't save this disaster. Do yourself a favor, watch the original, this version stinks."
1,Wrong Region Code,You think it would be written somewhere noticeable since I am purchasing this in the United States and I expect my videos to play in the correct format. I have to order another one because my kids want this movie so bad. Very disappointed. I could have purchased the anniversary addition for what I have to pay to replace the first one. Not happy.
3,Not so great,"The movie is a fun take on the Wizard of Oz with entertaining songs and dances and creative sets. I didn't care for Ross's singing, which often consisted of nonstop belting. I also didn't care for the costumes that showed butt cheek."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this Wiz package for the CD not the DVD. When the ad said that the music was a bonus, I decided to order it. I thought it had all the songs from the movie. However, it didn't. The CD only had eight songs on it. The main song I was looking for wasn't on the CD. Hopefully, If you're looking for a specific song, call the company to check to see if it's on the CD so that you're not disappointed. Other than that, it's nice."
5,Rocks over Wizard of Oz!!!!!,"Cool film! My mom got me into it. She knew that I liked The Wizard of Oz.Well, would I lke The Wiz? I saw the movie and I loved it!(I was 5) When I was 7, I was in love with the movie. Now I'm 10 and I still like it! What I like about is the rock music, dancing and humor. If you didnt see this movie, rent/buy it! It's better than The Wizard of Oz's music!!!!!"
1,Worst picture ever!,"Not only is Diana Ross downright scary in this awful butchering of the stage show, the sets are creepy, the dancing is amateurish and that scene at the end in the factory defies explanation -- as if it wandered in from some really low-budget porn studio. Worst use of Hollywood talent -- Richard Pryor, Michael Jackson -- imaginable.Other than that, it was okay."
4,A Classic,"This movie is a classic.Michael Jackson was great as the shy, a little timid scarecrow...When the Tin Man cries, for some reason it cracks me up.The music in this movie is great. Especially when Lean Horne sings ""Home""... I get goosebumps.The opening scene makes me think about my family.It's a must have for any DVD collection."
5,Ease on down the road!,"The was the best buy, it's came so quick as soon as i ordered it, and it was standard mailing, it's a classic must have!!!"
1,Diana Ross is too young to play Dorothy,Diana Ross as 10 year old Dorothy Gale? What were they thinking? She's too young! Wasn't Moms Mabley available to play this role?
3,Ho-hum second entry,"I discovered this show when I arrived in the UK a few years ago, and it quickly became a favorite (when I could find it.) When Vol I came out, I was quick to order several, one for me and others for gifts. I wasn't disappointed. Although the running time is short (IMO), what is there is great television. However, I'm disappointed with Vol II. There were a couple of repeat gags from Vol I, and several variations on a theme, which this show does a lot of. Overall, most of the gags in this volume fell flat for me. More grins than guffaws. Hoping vol III is a return to form...."
4,well crafted family drama,"What happens when a tragic accident rips apart not just a man's shoulder but an entire family? Can people forgive those whose actions lead to needless suffering? Can they forgive themselves for their own weaknesses and shortcomings? Bohjalian has addressed all these questions with such poignancy that they reader cannot help but reflect on his or her own life and circumstances. This novel starts as a page turner, but evolves into a slow and meditative study of human behavior. Each character is so well developed that by the end, you feel as if you know them and care about what happens in their futures. Though there is no real ""mystery"" here, as implied by the back cover, there is something very worthwhile. Definitely worth picking up."
3,Mixed Bag,"I was looking for a good and involving read for Christmas break. This book looked promising by what was written on the jacket and inside flaps. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. To me, it seemed that it was written for the upper middle-class yuppie: tennis at the club; a strong athletic, talented matriarch who for all intents and purposes seems smugly impressed with the fact that her son the attorney is now working as a Public Defender; the over-kill (pun intended) of the deer/the garden/hunting and how killing animals isn't necessary or necessarily bad. It also seemed that the beautiful people seemed more practical while the plainer-looking ones were either quirky or highly principled, both to the point of annoyance."
2,Not his best,"This is the fourth book of Chris Bohjalian's that I have read and I will continue to read other offerings by him, but I must admit, halfway through this book I was thinking about all the other good books I have piled up on my bookshelf that I am waiting to read. Mr. Bohjalian is a wonderful portrayer of the family drama and these are the parts of this book, of all his books that I like the best. But, I don't go for too much of anything and Spencer's fanatical animal rights activist character was just too much for me. The last 100 or so pages of this book were the best because they showed how the family endured and dealt with such a senseless tragedy, and, I think Spencer was able to finally realize and take responsibility his views and how the affected every one of his family members."
2,i don't know something what i can say,"hallo leute, ich spreche (schreibe) leider nicht gut englisch aber ich versuche es ;-) i like the Onions since i heard it the first time in the film "" sie nannten ihn Muecke"" it was a film about a footballteam with young boys out the bronx or somewere else. in my town i can't get the CD's so i ask you about them. the best greetings from l.kramer@ob.kamp.net"
2,i wait soo long for it,"i wait soo long for it, and came without a book... it is a pity. what can i tell more, what could happen different?"
1,mistake in ordering,"did not notice this pet tab had calcium, previously bought pet tabs without the extra calcium she loved them. These with calcium she will not eat. Not at all interested in them."
4,English vs Japanese,"After the first volume it colud only get better. However, I still think viz could have had better people for the english virsion. Japanese voices rock vampire knight. All the same, if its not the voices that satisfies, it's the hot characters. Try it out! I'm getting the next one."
3,A Little Misleading,"The product was advertised as the vocal score to ""Fiddler on the Roof"". Well it was to the movie not the stage production. I don't know if the keys are different or what things are different. But, it was a little disappointed."
5,wrong item but able to return,I ordered the wrong item but they were gracious to let me return it if I paid for all of the shipping.
2,problem,"My screen dims after seconds of turning it on and only by turning it off and on again would it remain lit for like 10 more secs, I looked around and apparently a lot people been getting this problem and its with the inverterboard, can somebody pleaz tell me what inverter board model it uses so i can get it replaced?"
2,monitor has flickering lines through it,"[UPDATE: Exchanged monitor and has been great since]I got this monitor for Christmas and it has lines running throught and real faint color changes. When you move the cursor or look closely you can see flickering lines throughout the display. My wife got this from Circuit City so I'll be taking it back when it opens. I tried all of the settings, installed the driver, etc. and no help. It only got worse the longer it was on. I am taking the computer to my brother's to see if his monitor works on it. Hopefully its the monitor and not the computer. It looked nice coming out of the box until I turned it on."
4,"Very convenient, nice bag","I really like this bag. It fits everything I need for my 15 month old and room for what I will need for my newborn in a few months. I love the backpack feature. I have used it as a backpack several times and now I couldn't live withouot it. I think there is room for some improvements - better, more comfortable straps (these are stiff and sometimes chaffe), and a slightly stiffer fabric for the bag and lighter colored interior would be helpful. Other than that, I love the bag!"
5,BEST BAG,"I have had a lot of diaper bags but this one is great. The material is amazing and washable, pattern is super cute. I get compliments all the time. I bought this one and bought another bigger one off of another site. LOVE THIS BAG."
4,Excellent procedural/thriller set in WWII,"This is a very impressive book, combining a first rate police procedural, an Allied/Nazi espionage thriller and a psychiatric case study. While parts are, as some of the other reviewers have noted, pretty gruesome, the gore is not used gratuitously, and one gets a chillingly accurate feeling for what it must have been like during the bombing of London. The combination of all sorts of elements in a perfectly tuned thriller makes this a definite 'must read'."
1,False advertisement,"When I received this part, several components were missing in accordance with the picture displayed on Amazon. I only received the 3 wire Sending Unit so I returned this item back to Amazon. I haven't received my refund yet and its been awhile."
3,Surf History,"Bruce Brown is the most famous surf film artist dating back to the late 50s where his films were shown in small auditoriums. This is his second film in the last 50s. Bruce narrates and has a friendly personality. The background music is good but not the typical surf sound to be found three years later. Watch this film to view history. Recognize this is 50s surfing and it's very good but very dated. The surfing was amazingly good for the type boards they used. But still, this is very dated and I found that it didn't hold my interest like other movies like the 70s Bustin Down the Door. Not bad, but very dated."
2,The Real Larry Clark reveals himself...,"Don't expect good horror or sci-fi here as Larry Clark concentrates primarily on sex scenes.For years he's made sleazy films like Kids and Bully under the guise of teaching people a lesson about the youth of today.With no moral lessions to hide behind in Teenage Caveman it's crystal clear what REALLY intersts Clark the most.This movie may appeal to some in a guilty pleasure way but the ""plot"" padded out with sleaze is awful."
2,A little too rough,"Does not come with some cushioning to support the scope, so it actually scratched by scope, a bit. I suggest get some black ribbon and glue it inside the rings, before trying them with scope."
2,Slow story,"I really liked Julie Hyzy's other books, so I was delighted to find this series. Unfortunately, I felt like I was really slogging through this story. Couldn't get intersted in the characters or the story. I kept putting the book down and forgetting to come back to it."
3,2.5 stars from Richie Rich,"I was disappointed when I got this album. A fan of Richie Rich this is his worst album to date if you ask me. Only has one real good song and about 5 ok ones with the rest not worth listening to. From the man who Snoop got his style from he follows what Snoop did - made worse cd's as he got older. Production is handled by: DJ Darryl - 4 songs (not as good as what he usually does, Lou - 3 songs, Stix - 3 songs. Has a few guests on here as well. If you are a HUGE fan of his I'd get this but otherwise pass it by.#1 - 6.5#2 - 7.5 (f/ justice)#3 - 7 (f/ too $hort)#4 - 8 (good beat - f/ Replacement killers)#5 - 7 (talkin' bout smokin' weed & fu*kin)#6 - 7.5 (f/ dede)#7 - 7.5 (f/ stalin - about low riders)#8 - 7.5 (f/ replacement killers)#9 - 4.5 (f/ psd)#10 - 6#11 - 6.5#12 - 7 (f/ harm)#13 - 6 (f/ wayno)Richard Serrell -- Aokland, CA415!!!check all my reviews"
5,Northern Exposure - the Complete Fifth Season,"I purchased this dvd as a gift and I've gotten no complaints, so I must assume that everything is just fine. The shipment was sent to me and it was received in good time and in good shape."
3,where's all the good music gone ???,"i am a HUGE NX fan...where's all the good music that originally aired in the show ?????the music helped 'make' this series... (i think season 1 & 2 have most of all the original tunes)...so why didn't they use the original music on these dvds ?did they not get the permission to use all those great songs on these new discs ???doesn't make sense to me at all...VERY disappointing, indeed."
5,Buy it!,"This video is energetic, attention-getting & utterly informative. I, as a parent, learned so much from this tape on the technical aspects of a fire fighter's job. We have since ordered Volume 2. A really great thing happened today at Wal-Mart. My son & I spotted a fire truck outside & later saw the fire fighters inside. My son said hello & started to report what he had learned from the video. They offered him a job (he's 4!) & subsequently invited him to visit their fire station. He was thrilled! A great, informative video for both kids & adults!"
4,great game,this is a great for harry potter fans it has some consgrapicsthey are great but we sould be able to to under stuff so 3.4gameplay can be repitive but world cup make it unless your not a harry potter fan don't get this game
4,Great Indie film,I saw ZigZag at the SXSW Film Festival in March 2002. I was sad to see that this film did not get released because the story and cast were intriguing and fresh. Sam Jones III who plays ZigZag gives an amazing first performance. I can't wait to buy the DVD so I can catch all of Oliver Platt's little sayings - his performance is one not to be missed.
3,"Magnificient movie, horrible edit!","At 17.99, this movie is too expensive especially when you consider its lack of special features. There's no bonus material or cut scenes, and this beautiful and fantastic movie was given a shoddy edit by Miramax. I bought my own DVD for 5.99 off eBay (brand new!)If you really want to own this movie, buy it used here or from eBay. It's not without its merits - its a good movie for kids to watch, I enjoyed it, and its still a somewhat decent movie despite what Miramax did to it. To see a better version, just see the Recobbled Cut (free online)"
4,My daughter loved it...I thought it was sweet!,"I love this movie! One reason I liked it so much is because it ISN""T Disney. We have many a Disney movie, and most of them are great. I still think it is time for others to join in trying to teach our children simple values. Go to school and help other people whenever you can. This movie did that without boring us or showing too much cleavage. It was an old fashioned kids movie. I loved the style of animation."
3,not as good as i remember it,the quality of the picture is not that great in this dvd. there are barely any special features. and it's moring boring than what i remembered.
4,My whole family adores this movie!,"When we rented this movie I wasn't expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself as hooked as my 4 and 6 year old boys. They enjoyed the story, the music, and the Thief. I especially enjoyed Jonathan Winters as the Thief. Needless to say, we now own this movie and watch it often."
3,"wrong, but i think i know why they did it","I've been a fan of bleach for over 2 years now, i have all the box sets excluding #6. I'm definitely not a fan of these companies cutting the seasons in half for the box sets but I have a pretty good idea why they are doing it. Here in the states, we've had quite a lull period when it comes to new bleach episodes on adult swim, i believe the new ones start on 8/28/10 and it starts off at episode 168, which is the start of the filler arc between the Hueco Mundo arc. At the moment for dvds they are up to episode 126, so there are 42 episodes left until the box sets catch up to where t.v. left off. So what I think they're doing is purposely cutting the box set seasons in half to allow the new episodes on t.v. to get into full swing and prevent the box sets from catching up. I'm sure they are also doing it for the money too, this is america after all."
1,Bleach is awesome...but,"the rating I gave is not for the quality and entertainment value of Bleach itself..its for the money grab attempt by Viz Media.I cannot in good conscience buy a season box like this..its just wrong.half a season for twice what a full season should cost is so wrong there isn't a phrase for it that doesn't include a lot of swear words.if you want more people to buy Bleach put whole seasons together, and cut the price in half. (the way the first season was. yeah i bought that one.) otherwise people will just keep watching them free online.the bount arc is lackluster anyway...but id still buy it...if the price was right."
3,Unfortunate.,"it is unfortunate that viz went the way of Naruto sets and have only 13 or so episodes. the best sets are the original 3 after that it's as if viz lost sight of the good thing they had going. what's worse is it seems like they just take so long to release this series it's unbearable. i can live with this transition if they at least speed up the release's but it is very unfortunate nonetheless. as far as how much i've paid they're all 29.96 or 34.96 at walmart stores, i've seen season's one and two as low as 24.96. so as one reviewer said there are other options out there. but it would be nice if viz did what they did before and have a true season set."
1,Stop the Greed!!!,It's fairly simple folks .... just record the shows on your DVR from Adult Swim ... capture them on your computer and record them on a Blu-Ray disc. Screw Viz Media and the horse they rode in on!
1,a sad day,"So we find that now they are going to release the DVDs in 12 episode installments but with the price at roughly the same you can purchase the original seasons. The original 3 seasons had more episodes, more features, more artwork... its pretty ridiculous. I pre-ordered this item and was so disappointed when this arrived instead of the full 6th season. If they continue down this path, they will no longer get my money, and that's the end of that. Funny thing is, it doesn't stop me from watching them on hulu. Save your money, find another way to watch these episodes."
5,Forgotten Gem,Edward G. Robinson sometimes gets a bad rap for his acting because he was type cast as a tough gangster. I'm a fan and have seen a lot of his non-ganster films and Scarlet Street is one of the best. Lots of twists and turns in this movie. The blue ray transfer is great. It makes this noir film look more than just a black and white feature. I would like to thank Kino Classics for deciding to release this movie in the restored form that it deserves.
4,The Moor Snake Haunts The Hummingbird,"Cuneiform and fuzzed-out, Cancer Moon deconstruct the crumbling ziggurat of rock'n'roll and build a basque Stonehenge (with nice glyphs and all) to rock the celestial bodies to Armaggedon. The godz will be happy tonite!"
4,"Great ""old school"" rock album",I saw Michael Schenker at the house of Blues in Chicago while on a business trip. It was a great show. He played a lot of UFO songs I had never heard and I thought I better start my collection with the 1st album. This is a good album. Not the same as the Lights Out disc I had years ago but still very good. It reminds me albums bands like the Scorps and Priest put out before they were big.
1,Frame Corroded in 13 months,We loved this trampoline when we first purchased it. Compared to other models we have had it went together very easily. At 9 months the company had to replace 3 of the top rails due to corrosion and rust that made the tramp unstable and unsafe for my kids to use. Now at 13 months I need the rest of the top rails replaced and the company is giving me a big hassle regarding this. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this trampoline if you expect it to last longer than a year.
1,Mcafee quickclean 5.0,"As a first time user of QuickClean and a recent purchaser of , quickclean 5.0 it is my understanding that the ""shred"" feature for unused disk space was a feature in 4.0. Why would McAfee remove such a valuable feature and hope to continue to sell the QuickClean product? 5.0 has limited value to users such as myself who have used their computer for a years without the benefits of a ""shredder""."
1,skipped cd,I purchased this product and on the intro part of the song. It skips. Its not a long intro but it does skip. Im sure other copies do the same thing
5,The best eyeliner I've ever used!,"I've used many eyeliners but this one, from Zhenbeauty.com has always applied smoothly and stays on, even during hot, sticky humid Chicago summers! The liner never needs a sharpener, which also means you never have to deal with wood shavings near your eyes."
4,nice compact case,very nice case simple yet stylish case barely enough space but everything fits i like it a lot
3,"The time machine, Director Simon wells","First i have to say that HG Wells Time machine is my favorite book,so nacheraly i was keen to see a new version on film. I was slighty alarmed to see that the producers had changed the original location of the story from Britain to the USA,which i think changes the whole flavour of the story,though i think verry little effort was made to keep the story faithfull to Wells masterpece.Though taken on it`s own as movie entertainment it comes throug with the goods. Though i would love to see an acurate version of the book brought to the screen,thoug i fear we will probably have to wait another fourty years."
2,Why ...oh Why..Come back HG.,I was terribly disappointed in this movie....yes the Special effects were good...even amazing at times...but the director has taken so much creative licence with this movie it barely resembles the original movie ...never mind the book. Perhaps he should have rewritten it himself and called it time machine revisited..Avoid this if you can two stars..but only for the special effects...acting and storyline a big ZERO
2,Bad,"This movie was just plain old bad and it cost 122 million dollars to make! Where did all that money go? I think it went to the bad special effects and the futuristic scenes. Everything in the movie to me looked really fake. The acting was okay that could have been worse. If your looking for a good movie try the original Time Machine in 1960, It was more interesting and didn't rely on special effects to be exciting. I don't recommend this movie at all."
5,Wonderfully intelligent movie,"Ignore all the bad reviews and comments about this movie. If you are like me, looking for an intelligent movie instead of the mindless drivel that 99% of the movies available provide, this movie is wonderful. It has a delightful ending which is very thought provoking. I also went back and watched the old time machine movie and found it to be boring and out dated. This new time machine movie brings up new and profound time continuum concepts. It emphasizes how important it is for us to try to get a glimpse of the future in order to understand what direction we should take in life. It even comments on the difference between short term self interests as opposed to long term community service. I guess in our narcissistic society obsessed with instant gratification, such noble and thought provoking concepts just sail right on by. How far we have fallen."
3,Give it a second chance.,"When I first saw this movie I was totally disappointed. Being a George Pal 1960s classic fan I just could not relate to this movie and I thought that there were too many obscure and not believable events and contradictions in the new 2002 film. I recently bought the dvd of this movie and watched it carefully, listening to the dialogue and also to the commentaries. I understand the movie better now and it does make more sense, however it still suffers from major contradictions and holes. I really want to like this movie but I am stretching my judgement already. The deleted scene would have helped somewhat but it was cut out. Overall: Poor to Fair (Good if you have a six pack before watching this). The DVD picture and sound quality are very good."
4,Perfect Popcorn Movie,"This is a film that carefully balances respect for the George Pal classic while trying to present new material without scarificing the original plot. Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H.G. Wells, does it for the most part. The Time Machine is a dazziling display of effects while allowing the characters to provide the binding so necessary to hold an audineces's attention. The creature features are a bit weak but the lavish photography and the pulse pounding pace leave little time for observation and complaint. Put on your fuzzy slippers, fire up the microwave popcorn and settle back for a time trip worth the taking."
3,Terrific Monsters plus Samantha Mumba,"Hard to match the old original with Rod Taylor or even the old Roddy McDowall flick ""Time After Time"". Well over 100 movies have been made featuring a Time Travel sub-plot, not all winners. Sadly, this one ranks far from ""Slaughterhouse 5"" (amazing)and closer to ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (bogus).Worth watching, just don't get your hopes up."
5,Purge your mind of the original. . . .,"and you will enjoy this movie very much. I've loved the original and watch it everytime I can catch it on tv. Once I got beyond thinking that this was the original, only with cooler effects, I allowed myself to enjoy it. I think it deserves much more than the low star ratings I keep seeing pop up. This film does not, and in my opinion, does not try to replace the original. It's another vision of similar material. I loved it. And the effects are quite awesome.On a slight side note: In my opinion, Jeremy Irons will always be perfectly cast as a villian. No offense to the actor. His voice, his mannerisms. . . he just plays one so well. I liked the lead actor also, even though I was somewhat bothered by him in the beginning. Good movie. If you're wondering, buy it, but don't go in expecting H.G. Wells. Sit back and have fun."
1,Ironic in how terrible it is . . .,"This movie utterly fails to capture the message of the H.G. Wells classic novel. Herein lies the irony: The eloi are not depicted as the subservient race that Wells meant them to be. That part is instead played by the audience. It's the audience whom the film has been marketed to who truly end up representing Wells' eloi, and the morlocks are embodied by the film executives responsible for letting this movie see the light of day. It's my hope that Simon Wells isn't a total idiot, and that this movie is just his way of proving his great-grandfather's anxities over the future to be completely justified. Man will eventually devolve into little more than beasts and cattle, and this film is evidence of our race trudging one step closer and being happy as hell about it."
5,Worth every star,"To start my review off: I have never seen nor read any previous works related to this movie, and therefore, unlike many reviewers, I review based on this movie alone, not its comparison to others or some book.This movie is great, from the very beginning to the very end. It takes you everywhere from days long ago to a high-tech future, and back? again to a primative world. While there may be a few points at which the plot falls off a little bit, it is not much, and overall its still amazing. The graphics and rendering done for this movie are superb.The last thing I'll mention is the score for this movie. The score, composed and conducted by Klaus Badelt, is amazing from start to finish. The few and sparse choral segments are just enough to leave you awe stricken and ready for more."
2,Hollywood needs to go back in time to redo this movie,"This movie started out pretty interesting, however it ended up not being a good movie. the music was beautiful and the scenary was nice, but the storyline was confusing and not good at all. This movie seems like it was thrown together. And it should have been longer. How many times must I say that there is no such thing as a good hour and a half action movie."
3,Home Theater disappointment,"Story aside this film has some great special effects mixed in with poor. At times this film is TV quality in effects and writing. My biggest beef is that of picture quality, ether poor encoding or DVD limitations this film becomes very blurry at times, I am sure this is fine on a 27"" screen but home theaters that show great detail will be disappointed with this film. The only redeeming value is the sound track with DTS was very nice.Picture quality 3.5 stars, Sound 5 stars"
2,Lame...,"I'm not sure how anyone can write a positive review of this movie. OK, I take that back. The only good thing going for this movie are some of the visually stunning sequences. I'll save you from an over-elaborate plot description other than a mourning professor builds a time machine and tries to save the woman he loves, instead finding himself 800,000 years in the future where the human species has split into two after the disintegration of the moon - the hunters and the hunted. The movie is poorly and woodenly acted and I'm truly astonished a studio paid money to make this film..."
2,The Time Machine,"Bad movie, weak plot, lots of plot inconsistencies. Very poorly done. The original was much better. This DVD is not a keeper."
2,Special Effects are Nice...,"...and that's about the only thing that's good about this movie. A thin plot, tired cliches, poor acting and directing, and a lousy ending are just a few of this movie's problems. HG Wells must be spinning in his grave after watching his wonderful book turned into a silly action flick by his grandson. Good sci-fi usually makes a statement about the human condition, as Wells did in his book, which warns the reader of the dangers of communism and fascism. The movie has no such lofty goals, and there is no statement here, just typical hollywood tripe aimed at the masses. It gets 2 stars for the nice special effects, most notably the time travel sequences. An okay rental for a rainy Saturday afternoon with plenty of cold beer, but I'd never actually buy this one."
2,Not quite good enough for me to recommend,"But its not a complete bomb either. The special effects are brilliant, the character development razor thin. Although I like Guy Pearce, he came off as wooden here. The script was weak. The effects and constant changing of locales kept the film watchable up until he settled in the far future. Then things get real boring. There was a glimmer of hope when we see the ultimate bad guy (played by Jeremy Irons) showdown with Pearce. Irons is magnificent, and everything he says is interesting, but his screen time ends far before I wanted it too. And the ""epic showdown"" between the 2 characters is reduced to that of a bad, corny action film. I had hoped for this film to be great, but it really falls short of ""good"" which is disapointing."
4,Enjoyable Watch,"It's hard to compete with the original Rod Taylor 'Time Machine' but this one comes very close. It's enjoyable from start to finish, with a great looking Time Machine,super special effects and an enjoyable plot.I would have preferred an ending somewhat similiar to the way the 1960 version ended (if you don't know I'm not going to spoil it - go watch it !) but I suppose the director didn't want to follow too close."
2,Don't fix it if it ain't broken.,"I do not understand why they bother remaking a movie which, the original version, was already a fine one. The acting stinks, the storyline is silly to say the least and it has no scientifical curiosity neither any momentum. THIS MOVIE STINKS get the original one it is much better......"
1,This Stunk!!,"I can't believe how terrible this movie was! It was not even worth a 4 dollar rental! it was shallow, booring, and it just stunk!"
3,"Special effects OK, story dreadful","The makers of this film saw fit to re-write H.G. Wells classic. Wells was a genius. The rewrite man was a ""hack"". Apparently significant changes were made to fit the graphic desigh of the wotld of the future. In doing so the original plot was rendered mindless. If you have never read the book or seen the last ""Time Machine"" you might possibly like this one, even with the nagging sense of ""this does not make sense"".Or buy this one then treat yourself to the good version from the 1950s or thereabouts."
2,Slow plot but decent effects,"The possibility of time travel has always fascinated me, yet I was pretty bored for a good portion of the movie. There wasn't much character development, and the plot lacked substance. I was not ""on the edge of my seat,"" even when there was some action and danger. I found myself analyzing how (un)realistic some of the special effects were (""wow that time lapse is way off""), and how they were done. This is a sign of a fairly boring movie. Still, the special effects were decent, and there was somewhat of a story line you could follow if the movie held your interest long enough."
3,H.G Wells has been left in the past with this film 'remake',"There is a number of things that you would question in the movie, surely the use of computer graphics to spruce up the picture which did lead a more dazzeling film, but to use the title 'The Time Machine', that of HG Wells original book is rather more an insult for that it does not hardly follow the original ideas of the novel.I enjoyed parts of this film, a good soundtrack also complimented to the mood, but a weak plot, a poor beggining and even a poor ending of the film had spoilt it in effect from start to finish,,,,,,,, a man who can read minds was not able read the words that would lead to his death.The film is in no way a comparison to the novel, it does not show the meaning of that what was intended through the novel, it is a average film that would please most of the audience until somthing new comes out, it surely is no masterpeice."
5,A good book for begginers,"This is a book that can help you, if you need a help to learn turkish (and of course you need, just like me). Im a brasilian who is learning english and turkish same time (but Im beggining to learn turkish only now). So, I think this book can help you and help me!"
3,Not too special...,"I bought this CD because I had looked this band up on allmusic and they gushed about how the Mindbenders were one of the great lost bands of the 60's. Well, there's a reason these guys didn't make it big: they weren't very good. They're decent enough players, but their albums are just collections of party-rock covers. For a British group in 1966/67 to release albums with virtually no originals was unacceptable from an artistic standpoint. If you're looking for a J. Geils-type good-time party record, this will do nicely. In fact, they cover ""Homework"" just like Geils did. If you're looking for British-style 60's pop music, however, look somewhere else. These guys were like a British Johnny Rivers, if that helps your frame of reference."
4,A long-awaited goodie!,"Finally! It's here on CD, and there isn't a let-down at all. The songs on this album have always been great, (esp. faves:Metal Daze, Fast Taker, Dark Avenger) but now they're even better on this remastered version. The booklet is probably the best thing about it; lots of pictures and quips from the band. The only thing that I find lacking is the production, especially for it being remastered. Yes, I know this was originally done a long time ago, but when I buy something remastered, I expect top quality. Still, it's a must-have for any self-respecting Manowar fan. You gotta love these guys!"
5,THE CREATION,"With this album MANOWAR gave life to epic metal. Swords, sorcery, great battles, brotherhood, honor and valor... A must for all those who hail true heavy metal."
5,Earth Mother,"I have always been a nature lover. This book reminds me why. I now know I have always had a mother-daughter connection with my Earth Mother unlike the one I sought, but never found, with my birth mother."
3,The view of a twelve year old gymnast,"I am a 12-year-old elite gymnast, in training for the 2012 Olympics!Here are some amazing things in this book.Did you know that a young gymnast called Adriana was murdered by her coach?It does not, however, tell the story of Australian gymnast Sophie Gilligan, who at 13 looked 6. An Olympic prospect at age 13, but she was turned down by the olympic selectors because she was too young. Her obese stage mother told the tiny, 66-pound Sophie off. Later that day, the depressed, sad Sophie beat both her mother and her cute, chubby 4-year-old sister Molli to death, then committed suicide. She was a great and promising gymnast, and we lost her."
1,A very one sided opinion,"Joan Ryan gave a very one sided opinion of gymnastics, gymnastics is not child abuse! Ryan just gave the ugly side of the sport without showing the good side such as: strength, flexibility, and grace. You could take any other sport and show the ugly side of it. Gymnastics has a lot more pros then it does cons!"
3,Almost every gymnast or figure skater says the same things!,"And they are: ""What I Have To Give Up To Do This"" or ""What I Broke-Sprained-Strained-Bumped This Week."" I've read from several sources that the girls are coached on what to say in interviews, so that doesn't surprise me.However, if their dreams do not materialize, they DO at least have an interesting reason for ""missing"" their adolescence, unlike the ""I just wasn't popular."" that for many is the truth."
3,A very one sided view of gymnastics.,"I have spent almost my entire life in and around the gym. I have meet olympic, world, and NCAA champions. My friends consist mostly of college gymnasts, and I found the book to have many faults. I will admit it was a page turner, but it portrayed gymnastics soley in a bad light. There is so much more to the sport, and so many good gymnasts that have not gone through what Joan Ryan described as the norm. I think next time Joan Ryan needs to check out the facts, and support her claims. The best way to make a strong argument is to state the other opinion."
4,Little Girls in Pretty Boxes.....,"I believe Ryan is correct in the life of gymnasts and figure skaters...I have been a gymnast for 15 years now, and have seen more people quit the sport because of feeling to ""big"", or from anorexia or bulimia, than people who have had to quit because of injuries. Also, the people who quit because of eating disorders didn't quit because someone told them they were fat or anything...from a gymnasts' point of view the way I look at it is that you are constantly surrounded by people smaller or bigger than you in a leotard that shows everything, so some people just assume they are fat even when they are smaller than the average person...just thought I'd share my comments! Thanks!"
3,True And False,"Yes, it is true that some gymnasts, figure skaters, ballerinas, and other athletes (such as wrestlers, cross country runners, etc.) have suffered from EDs. Well, so have singer Karen Carpenter, Princess Diana, Victoria Beckham, and many other celebrities. Does this mean only celebrities have EDs? No, they're just in the spotlight. USA Gymnastics, as an example, has worked hard nowadays to educate their coaches and such about EDs, their symptoms etc. Keep in mind that about 2% to 6% of the USA population suffer from anorexia and/or bulimia. This means about 5 to 16 million people suffer from these disorders. So, this book has some good, shocking information that opens up people's eyes, but I think it has been wrongly presented. This is just my opinion though. I wish you would keep this in mind while you read the book. It is not the sport's fault that these athletes have EDs."
1,WHAT A DISGRACEFUL WOMAN JOAN RYAN IS,"This book makes me utterly ill. Has Joan Ryan ever been an elite gymnast? NO!! So therefore, why does she think that she has the right to write a book about a subject in which she has no experience. I think that she's just a sick, sick person, and everybody who says that this book is good, you'll are sick pepole, too."
3,THE CHANGE OF GYMNASTIC,"Olivia was eleven. she wanted to be a gymnast so she was watching olga Korbut live at the olymips she noticed that Olga Korbut was skinny and perpurspent at 36kg .but olivia had breasts and hips and was plump at 120 pounds but she wanted to be a gymnast but if olga changed gymnastic she could not join, because the sport would be for tiny skinny preprubesnt girls aged 13-15 that they would stary gymnastics at age3,4,5,6,. It would be too late for Olivia sha hd to stop olga so she ran onto the floor and olga's feet plummeted into her fat stomach and Olgs Korbut was mad and she jumped on Olivias tummy and olivia felt allhot and sick she rubbed her sore tummy but she sicked all over the floor and since olga jumped and upset olivia's tummy she also had diarea as she was sicking.and that is the story of how olivia missed her chance at the olumpics and lots of other girls too"
1,Aiuka's Review,"I do not think this book true about gymasts. Gymansits is healthy. Because I know. because I havea been a gymnast since age 4. And I am not too skinny either. My coach has never said, ""Aiuka, lose weight"" I am 5 ft tall and weigh 70 pound. I have been gymnast 10 years. But Jaon Ryan says that gymnasts are subject to eating disorders. Staying healthy is not disordered eating. The higher up you go, the skinnyer the Gymnasts are, because they are seruis. A girl called Holly who is now 15 she said she wasn't going to lose weigh even though her belly hung down obvously. so she did not get far. She ended up bringing our team down. So we poked her and told her she needed to lose weight, but this was reasonable"
5,you've got to understand,"I read this book. I was an eliet gymnast for 9 years. I trained with Bela, and I know what wenton inside the yellow walls. Yes this is what happens. The book is true, but you have to understand that an extreme level requires extreme actions. I trained a long time and did many of the things Ryan wrote about. And I don't regret it. I lost many friends and even my sister to the harsh reality of gymnastics."
2,government arts funding behind it,"This book is about government control of a good private industry-gymnastic dance schools, because government funded ballet schools are drying up and lost students to gymnastics. It is a tabloid trash rendition of rumors and unproved gossip, amid a few sad accidents which happen everywhere, ballet, football, skateboards etc. Beware of the government losers who want ballet funding to go forever, even when gymnastic and ice dance are far better looking and POPULAR! This book is so lame, none of the ideas about government can happen because it would just be more tax dollars wasted to monitor private education, which by the way is unconstitutional!"
1,TERRIBLE!!! ( I rated one star b/c it wouldnt let me put 0),"I think this book is DISCUSTING!!! It bashes the famous Gymnastics coach (not to mention the best on there is), Bela Karolyi on nearly EVRY PAGE!! This book mekes me SICK!! I bought it and threw it out the very same day! Joan Ryan must have NO LIFE! Writing a book talking about how terribly HORRIBLE elite gymnastics and figure skating is! This poor woman must be sick! What IS this book??"
3,Mis-labled item,"This product was recieved in a timely manner and was in great shape. It was just for the wrong year of Suzuki Marauder VZ800.Then vender was very nice and let me return it and paid for the return shipping. (I dont think they always do that)The vendor found me a brand new turn signal and sold it to me at a great price.These guys are great, I will do business with them agian if I need parts for my VZ800 Marauder."
1,Not safe!,I bought this product for my infant and when I went to the fire station to have the seat installed (with the bundle me in it) the fireman told me that this product should not be used! He explained that it interferred with the harness and if we were in a crash the baby could come flying out or have serious injuries!! I wouldn't recommend it but I would recommend the shower-cap style covers that don't go behind the baby but just over the outside of the infant seat.
4,Very snuggly,This is great for the colder states. It is very easy to install and travels with you. You don't have to worry about dragging around a blanket and the baby kicking it off. The only down side is we couldn't pull up the shade on the infant car seat if we were on a stroll. Other than that we really liked it.
5,Great for winter,Very comfortable and warm for the winter. Great product to use espacially for infants becasue you don't have to worry about dressing them up really warm when taking them out of the car and into it.
5,Great Product,"We bought this because our son was quickly outgrowing his car seat and big snow suits and coats made it that much tighter, so by using this we didn't have to put them on him. Fit very good on our graco car set, kept baby warm and it's a lot easier to just zip this down when you get somewhere rather than take coats on & off. I will be stashing this away to use if I have another baby, wish I bought it sooner."
4,Very pleased,"The Bundle Me is very cozy, warm and all you need to keep your baby warm during the winter months. It's so effective our daughter even sweats in it sometimes. We dress her in a long-sleeved onesie, throw a hat on and she's ready to go outside. Overall, a wonderful thing to have."
4,CHARMING KIDS AND DOG MOVIE,"If you have a little girl around the house this is a great movie to watch. Two orphaned sisters are adopted by a childless NYC couple and move from their rural orphanage to an affluent high-rise overlooking Central Park. The plot thickens with their smuggling their Great Dane puppy in with them. As the puppy grows, so do their problems. Cynical adults will have a lot of problems with the plausibility of all this, but a little suspension of disbelief with go a long way toward making this an enjoyable movie.The movie's best feature are the two sisters played by Makenzie Vega {younger sister of Alexa of ""Spy Kids"" fame} and Abigail Breslin, now famous for ""Little Miss Sunshine"". The two girls really carry the movie.A lot of light-hearted family fun.Blaine in Seattle."
5,Great movie for children,"this is a great movie for kids, family is emphasized, there is some adventure and fun, almost any little girl would love this movie"
4,Perfect Family Fun!!!,"My aunt let us borrow this movie, and I thought it was very good & very funny! Two sisters named Sal and Rae live at an orphanage and find a Great Dane puppy and sneak him back to the orphanage. When they are adopted, they sneak him into their new home. It becomes more difficult ehen he gets older. There was a little part I cried at, but don't worry, it doesn't have a 'Marley & Me' ending. If you love cute dog movies, you'll love CHESTNUT!!!"
4,"Sonar, Signal Processing Intro","I picked up this book for an introduction for Sonar/Radar. My background knowledge of DSP helped me understand the material, but there is a brief intro for basic signal processing. Other techniques such as beamforming, sonar systems are explained in good detail. Easy to read, diagrams are not too good. Reasonable amount of derivation of results to convince me of the results stated. written in 1991, I am looking for a more updated book though."
3,The definitive zombie film,"Let me just say that the punk rock soundtrack is worth checking out by it self. Never mind the fact that Linnea Quigley does a full nude strip in a grave yard. It's not the most clever zombie film in the world seeing as though it doesnt follow the bullet in the head decline but it certainly has it's moments.It's a must own among horror aficionado's it's nothing else like you own. If you like it check out Demons, another great 80's fright flick."
4,*Comedy + Gore =FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!*,i have to say i loved this movie when i was 5 and i still love it to this day. if you like zombies who curse and have the munchies for brains every now and again youll love this movie!!!!
5,A true masterpeace,"For the most part, Return of the living dead was a movie with great plot and backup story to support it. The characters, or most of them anyways, were also well played out. Nudity also!! Hot chick gets naked full frontal nudity. My only complaint with this movie, is one of the scenes repeat (I'll let you catch it), and some of the acting wasnt all that great. Overall, I gave this movie a 5 star raiting because for its time, it was a pretty good zombie flick. Worth watching more than once."
3,It was better when I was younger...,"Two nitwits who are employed at a company that provides corpses for ballistic testing, split dogs for university professors, and much more decide to check out some canisters in the company basement. After an accident with the canisters the dead merchandise in the warehouse wakes up and begins to terrorize the the two employees. After some trouble with one of the ""living corpse"" they finally get to cremate it and think their problems are gone--or at least so they think. This horror film produces some jumps and scares with a smile; however, the characters could have been depicted with much better clarity and acting."
5,The living dead return...,"As if they didn't have anything else to do... I love watching this movie. It brings back memories of a time when I used to swim in the lake. I once saw a van down by the river, but never looking inside. I assumed they had ice cream. I was hoping all along that Bennett would let off some steam... And guess what? He did. Nothing else to say but, watch the damn movie, then go on with your life. There nothing here to see folks, keep moving."
5,A perfect 80s horror classic!,"Don't even read this, just get this DVD, but make sure you're not drinking anything while you watch, or you'll have a mess.A+ movie, hilarious writing, funny EVERYTHING!BRAINS! Send more cops! Send more, paramedics! You'll see!"
4,B-Movie Classic,"The acting ain't great, the special effects ain't great, but I still watch Return of the Living Dead. It's a great movie if you take it for what is is, a mindless BRAINLESS (a bit of pun intended) fun!"
4,"""What's in this rain?""","""Return of the Living Dead"" turned out to be a much better film that I had anticipated. Being a huge zombie movie fan, I was destined to find entertainment value in this film, but really didn't expect to enjy it as much as I did.The acting in the film is better than most of the genre, the humor is great and the gore is fantastic. It even has some chilling moments.Fun film, well worth the purchase if you are into these types of films."
3,Good but not great,"These sardines are very good. Great for crackers, salads or horderves(sp?). But if you want a real meal deal go for the Reese sardines in olive oil product. The Reese sardines are large and better suited for dinner."
3,please stop shipments,"Product is ok but it is impossible to stop the orders from coming. I no longer want them., [lease stop shipments"
4,Perfectly charming illustrations,"Marthe Jocelyn's ""Hannah and the Seven Dresses"" has perfectly charming illustrations! Hannah is a young girl who has difficulty figuring out what to wear--mostly because her mother, an accomplished seamstress, has made her so many pretty dresses. Hannah soon figures out how to get dressed each morning without having to dither over her dresses, but when her birthday comes along, the problem presents itself anew. Which of her splendid outfits is most fitting for a birthday party?The story is not nearly as strong as the illustrations, which are superb. Jocelyn has employed all manner of fabrics, beading, trim, and more to create utterly captivating and colorful illustrations which present each dress with loving care and detail. No wonder Hannah has difficulty choosing--each dress is a marvel!"
4,The Cover Girls.,"The Cover Girls just like Expose were in a way ignored by MTV and never got the fame they deserved. The highlights on this album ""Show Me"" ""Because of You"" ""Wishing On A Star"" ""My Heart Skips A Beat"" ""and ""We Can't Go Wrong"". This album features the original recordings which means they are the long versions. It is a good album to have for the '80s fan an d is a must for freestyle. I recommend this album."
4,The Best of Freestyle,"The Cover Girls certainly never got the recognition and fame that they deserved. In the early 90's The Cover Girls had a slew of hits that made you want to dance like Show Me, Because of You, and Inside Out. Then they changed gears a bit to appeal to a larger more radio frindly audience. They succeeded by putting out two of the most lovely ballads to hit the airwaves. They stunning cover of Wishing On a Star and the gorgeous We Can't Go Wrong. It is unfortunate that these talented ladies got lost in the shuffle of other girl groups as alternative music started to overtale radio. Also included is another gorgous ballad Thank You, and the fun All That Glitters. This song is one of theose songs that will make you smile. With it's happy lyrics and funky rythyms. Other unknown tracks aren't really worth listening too, but you still won't be disappointed. A great mix of dance songs and ballads that will leave you craving for more."
4,Cover Girls are classic late 80's freestyle,"For those that enjoy the freestyle bet of the late 80's, (i.e. Expose', Sweet Sensation, Company B) this is a great collection. Although the line-up has been juggled over the years the music remains strong! Funk Boutique is every bit as happening as Show Me and Because of You. The ballads on this album are great also, as well as thier version of ""Wishing on a Star"". The music is actually better than thier chart success, although they did have about 8 songs in the top 100."
4,Jon Anderson at the top of his form,"This is quintessential Jon. He recorded most of the album by himself, played most of the instruments, and wrote all the songs. It's a quasi-fantasy concept album that owes a lot to Lord of the Rings, but for great songs, you can't beat it. Lots of fun, very organic, very original. I recommend it!"
5,Jon at his best,"This is a wonderful Jon Anderson album; I consider it his best work outside of Yes. My only real disappointment with the CD was the discovery that the ""small"" sound of the ""big"" arrangements was not improved by the new medium; it sounded smaller than I thought it should on LP, and I always thought it was my stereo. But it still sounds small on CD. Ah well, still, a lovely piece of work that leaves me feeling more tranquile and centered after every listening. ProgFolkSpacePop at its finest!"
4,Anderson's Best Solo Work,"Hmm... after Relayer in '74, the members of Yes took time out to record solo albums. This was the time of Squire's Fish Out of Water and Howe's Beginnings as well. Anderson's Olias of Sunhillow uses multi-layered vocals to replicate the feel of airy Yes of the period, lots of harp and gauzy sound, the kind tha Anderson's voice shines best through. Forget the plot, the lyrics are silly; this is about the sound. If the sound of Jon Anderson's voice grabs you and deposits you squarely in the driver's seat of your old Camaro with the 8-track, circa the mid-70s, then this record will deliver the goods. At the time it was recorded, Anderson has just done Close to the Edge, Tales of Topographic Oceans, and Relayer in rapid succession, and has Going for the One in the offing. In other words, this is straight from his peak. I still think its his best solo album; no New Age, no faux gravitas, just idyllic, psychedelic sounds inspired by his other-worldly visitors."
3,so many great reviews?,"I expected more from this disc than it delivered. I listened to it about 5-6 times and failed to find the magic that so many others have. For the would be buyer, be forewarned: This is a very creative bit of listening art, but the talent of the players is lacking. There is nothing even close to the talent of Yes in this music. Also, this is closer to New Age than it is to Prog Rock. You may find it enjoyable, as it is unique. Prog rock - No!"
2,Isuzu grille clip,These clips are not quite as large as the original clips. Although the difference in size is just a couple millimeters it required that I had to trim every clip a little deeper in order for it to clip in and lock in place. Using these clips made a 10 minute job an hour long.
2,trying to be like janet jackson,"this album came out a year after janet's best album velvet rope and you can tell whitney was trying to live up to that with having a dance song it's not right but it's okay and an r&b ballad like heartbreak hotel but these songs aren't even remembered today like together again for example. And when she was touring there was no hype behind it either like the velvet rope tour. The only good song off this CD was I learned from the best while the other hit singles grew stale fast though I was enjoying them only when they firzt came out. Just Whitney is a much better album in my opinion in which she goes back to traditional r&b without sounding pop like she did on this CD, but her voice isn't what it used to be anymore, from all that crack"
2,What a let down!,"I cannot begin to tell you how disapointed I am in this album! I heard all of these songs on the radio so I went out and bought the cd and all of these songs sound different. The whole reason people buy albums is because they like what they hear on the radio and this is definitely not it. My suggestion would be to buy the singles because they have different varieties of the songs, do not buy this album."
2,I was truly dissapointed with this album.,"When I heard Heartbreak Hotel with Kelly Price and Faith Evans, I thought ""Whitney has done it again"" so I ran out and bought the album. To my disappointment, it was one of only 3 decent songs on the album. The duet with Mariah, When You Believe, is a beautiful song. Mariah and Whitney do sound good together. You'll Never Stand Alone is a true ""Whitney Houston Song"" you can hear her put her heart and soul into the song. As for the rest of the album, It was a true disappointment. I spent the whole night wishing for my money back. What a waste. I was suprised to hear that In My Business, Written by Missy Elliot, was such a let down. You would expect something much more funky coming from that combination. In a nutshell, Whitney can do much better than this. Maybe next time."
2,Lets' get it together whitney!!!!,"With more than 15 years in the music industry you would think Whitney Huston would be putting out great records right?? NOT!!! ""My Love is You Love"" is a bad attempt of Whintney trying to sing R&B. Give it up. She does not accomplish this at all. The only worthwile song on this album to buy is ""When You Belive"" the duet with Mariah Carey. It's only good because Mariah is on it. Without her the song would be horrid. Whitney is alos out sung on ""heart break hotel"" by Kelly Price who used to sing backup for Mariah. So save your self the trouble - Go buy ""#1's"" instead."
2,R&B isn't your thing girl!,"I gave this album two stars for the reason that her usual style which is the Diva style is being changed to R&B which isn't her style. People are used to hearing her powerful voice in her previous albums. I thought that this album will be as it was before, POP, but now it's a different story. Better not release again if this will continue and please go back to your usual style."
2,Lukewarm material,"I love Whitney Houston and feel that she has the best voice in the industry, but I must say I was very disappointed by the very ""average"" songs on this CD. With a voice as powerful and capable as hers, she doesn't have to settle for such mediocre material. Sure there are some good ones, her duet with Mariah Carey was fabulous, but even Whitney sounded bored to me. The whole thing left me looking forward to her next CD and hoping it's not such a long wait."
4,"Whitney Houston opens up with ""My Love is Your Love""","Ease up ""Whitneyphiles""!!!! Any artist worth his or her salt has to grow sonically and thematically, and I for one am very pleased with the results on ""My Love is Your Love."" If you believe just a fraction of what you read about Whitney, you've got to realize she's not the ""princess"" we made her out to be....but why should she be? She's human like the rest of us. For the first time, she seems to be singing about themes that may actually have some resonance with her real life. Yes her voice sounds deeper, and raspier than it used to, but its got more edge and character than before. ""Its not Right, But its OK"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""In My Business"" and ""Oh Yes"" are hip-hop/R&B gems. The title track is simple, beautiful and seemingly heartfelt. Two thumbs up for a very nice piece of work!"
4,Whitney is in fine form.,"Whitney has still got the voice. The songs on the other hand get a little repetative. The upbeat tracks were probably designed to show a funkier Whitney and it works but the songs all sound alike. Her vocals soar on the ballads, especially the haunting I Learned From the Best. I wish her remixes of It's Not Right But It's Okay and My Love is Your Love were on here but the album cuts are good. If you are a Whitney fan, you must own this CD."
2,Best Song in a Long Time,My Love is Your Love is the best song that Whitney has had in a VERY long time. This song is beautiful. I love the beat and the tune.
4,She blends in great with the changes of music,"For all of those who don't think that this album is great, they're all full of it. Whitney came through and alot of people expected her to come back with the sound of years past. If the people who write in were true fans, they should've been keeping up and they would know what kind of style Whitney is coming back out with. Mariah's a great singer but Whitney's my girl. Reviewer's say that she shouldn't change her style but Ms. Carey did the same, what about her. Much love Mariah but I gotta keep it real, both of you sound great. Whitney came out blazin' especially with the first track. She has great producers and who said that Whitney isn't an R&B artist? She kept it tight to death and with the changing times she gets much respect from me. Don't change a thing Whitney!"
2,Whitney could have done a lot better.,"I think ""MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE"" is not up to Whitney's standards...When I first put the cd in, I thought it was pretty good...Well the first 2 songs...then it got kind of to hip-hop and upbeat for Whitney. I think she is just trying to fit in with the in thing, but that is not always the best thing, because you are selling out yourself. I think whitney could have been better. I think Janet is beginning to beat her in the diva slot right now, at least Janet is being true to herself..."
5,the queen of the soul,Whitney is the queen of the soul in my heart forever.You can feel deeply the true emotions in this album. We disire of you to hold a live concert in china! Do you know how many fans you have in china? 1 billion!
5,the best I've heard in a long time. you go whitney,I think you must have been in side of me. When i listen to your new cd It feels like you know my life. Thanks for making me cry when i need to. Thanks for allowing me to laugh and smile when i feel like it. You are great Keep it up!!!
3,Disappointed,"While I am a Whitney Houston fan, I was not as pleased with this release as compaired to some of her others. My Love Is Your Love sounds like a completely different song from what is aired on the radio. The same is true of It's Not Right But It's Okay. The album is marginal."
3,Great little easy read,"My story is in a review under the book Twin Souls by Joudry. Not trying to advertise for it but I can't rewrite the entire thing. Most of these books are great and provide a good understanding into the situation. This one was a great little book and very easy to read. The mantras at the end really do provide for more peaceful experiences but I don't say them all the time. It added a basic explanation and put it in a way that took away the fear. The hardest was seeing myself that way to love myself and then deal with what I could have, but I did. Thank God."
2,Love conquers ALL!,I find this book to be very informative.Concerning Love an Relationships.I'm not will for the ritualistic way it's presented in this book.With the Violet Flame an the certain prayers.To enlist upon.I feel that is not necessary for Empowering Love.Also not all indiviuals have soul mate are Twin flames.
3,Dog still barks,Worked when I first got it about a couple of weeks but dog is barking away now. Still have it up and turned it off to see if the dog barked alot more but no change. Still have it may try turning it back on and see what happens
3,"Not Bad, Not Excellent","Just like the CA public school system it is neither bad, nor good. Book is over simplified which sometimes causes it to be misleading. Eh, it's ok."
3,This book is ok but not that great,"Pros:1. This book is pretty concise and I appreciate the author's effort to only keep the essentials of naive set theory.2. I like the presentation. There is a pretty smooth gradient in the increasing complexity of the topics.3. This is a good introduction to more abstract mathematics. I used the first third of this book for a math lecture I gave at MIT. Of course, I had to do a fair amount of hand-holding to make sure everyone understood what was going on.Cons:1. There are not many problems following most of the chapters. At least having more worked examples would improve this book for autodidacts.2. The writing style is pretty boring. One can easily lose the motivation to keep on reading."
5,Great for Self-Study,"This book is very clear. The style is informal but the details of the rigor are transparent, which is good for every student of mathematics to see at some time. This is especially important because set theory is something that is often used at the foundation of other mathematical works.I'm very pleased that a foundations book can be so accessible to undergraduates."
5,Far from naive - as clued up as you can get,"""Naive"" set theory usually means: set theory taken from an intuitive standpoint, rather than taking the Axioms as basis. However, this book *does* explore set theory from the axioms - but paradoxically does this in a ""naive"" style.For an explanation of the Axiom of Choice and its implications and relevance, there are few to beat it."
3,all in all pretty good!,"I mean the story is full of holes, but all in all the adventures the 'young master' encounters are fun, sexy and really quite humorous! Having seen the original Japanese (non-TV) version this is much lighter on the sexual aspect of the story and more romance oriented... if ever you get a chance... and you have gotten 'Verite' see if you can find the original 'Hanaukyo Maids Tai'... it is not a kids item but you will laugh your head off!"
1,"Horrible waste of money, it doesn't even deserve that star!","I do not own this vaccuum, I own a real roomba. I have, however seen the inner workings of this vaccuum and talked to people who got it out of curiousity. First of all, THERE IS NO INTELLAGENCE WHAT SO EVER!!! This vaccuum operates on the simple engineering of a differential. Basically it goes very, very slowly until it hits a wall, at which point a very simple gear box(comprised of under 10 gears) rotates the drive wheel until it is free sending it off in another random direction. The chances of this cleaning a 10X10 room with one or two obstacles in it are REMOTE at BEST. The other thing is there is no ground clearance between the pad and the floor, people who have used it said it just piles up the dirt right in front of it, or snow plows it. If you absolutly must have a robotic vaccuum, get the roomba, that thing is at least relativly decent. Steer clear as this is truly a piece of junk!"
4,Beautiful ring!,"This ring is simply beautiful. I got a size too big and the customer service was great. I was afraid the design was going to look too gaudy on my finger, but it looks classy and elegent. THe longer amber goes to almost the knuckle, but it's SUPER comfy and definitely not intrusive."
3,i got this cordless set to build my garage..,"it worked great the first year, after that the batteries swelled up from recharging and are extreemly difficult to remove from the drill and skill saw. they hold a charge for a minimal amount of time, and i need to to keep one in the charger full time to finish any job. i purchased a second kit (it was less expensive than just a replacement battery), and it worked fine to start, but after 6 months the battery is bad(wont hold a charge more than 10 minutes) either. i am looking for a good replacement set. and still i am undecided in which product or brand would fit my needs. I dont want to buy batteries every two years."
4,Funny,"Not a great hit of a movie, but it entertains. I have a rat rescue and do not recommend holding a rat by the tail, washing him in a washing machine, nor hanging him up to dry by the tail. The story is good hearted and worthwhile watching, but do not do what they did to the poor rat."
3,feed this movie rat poison,"This may be perhaps the silliest movie I've ever seen. The idea of a husband/father turning into a rat is just a strange storyline. I wouldn't say this movie is necessarily a childrens movie either. It's more like, well, just a really silly movie that some families might enjoy.I guess it was an okay film. What I REALLY loved about it was all the really good songs that played throughout the film, which didn't resemble the storyline in any way. Then again, I'm not Irish, so maybe they did.I think what kind of rubbed me the wrong way about the film was how the other family members continued treating the rat like it was the man of the family, and none of this looked believable at all. For instance, the wife was determined to get the rat to eat his supper during dinnertime. I think if someone I knew had turned into a rat, the last thing I'd care about is why they're not eating.I just couldn't get into the movie."
1,Terrible and impossible to play transcriptions...,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Every Johnson piece is transcribed to be played in the hardest possible manner.Also, I honestly have to say, a lot of the pieces do not even sound right--and I only tried playing 3....Please do yourself a favor and skip this book. IT IS TERRIBLE.For Example try playing this:----------------------------0------0-0--0---0-2--2---2The minute you see something like this, you know its a terrible transcription and won't sound right; you are better off just watching youtube videos or googling tabs for Johnson.THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE. It's only use is that you can play Johnson pieces on piano :/ and it can give you a general idea of how to play a piece that is not tabbed online."
5,columbo 6/7,"this set is single sided and the quality is great; a vast improvement over previous sets, which were double sided dvd's and had bad spots in them. appears they got enough negative feedback and fixed it."
4,Still the edgy Columbo,"I believe these are the last of early Columbo episodes. The episodes are still high quality and Columbo still has a nice edge to him. As a diehard Columbo fan, I will probably buy the 80s and 90s stuff too -- but if you are fan of the early Columbo, this is still a must have."
5,good buy,You will love all the movies. It is worth the investment because there is such a nice vareity. Columbo is great and it is a good buy.
5,before my time and still awesome!!!!!,"i actually purchased this set for my moms birthday and she asked me to watch it with her. at first i was skeptical, because well im 20 and this is older than i am. but to my surprise Columbo is awesome. i love the fact that the characters are much more articulate than they would be nowadays. But my favorite thing is Columbo'S intelligent yet deceptive nature in dealing with the suspects, in the words of Rob Schneider ""he pretends to be stupid, but hes actually sharp as a tac."" . All in all a great buy and i recommend it to any detective show enthusiast or any one who just likes a good show."
2,"If you're looking for great British comedy, keep looking","I saw the trailer and was mildly pleased, so I decided to rent this. I shouldn't have done. This is coarse mainstream humour in the guise of faux Monty-Python-esque absurd comedy. Same packaging, none of the ingenious content. If you look for truly absurd, clever English comedy, get the original Office (BBC version) or try any of the Alan Partridge shows by Steve Coogan."
5,Great Music Book,"I purchased this book not long ago, so I have not read it completely. But I can ensure any one that it is a great music theory book to learn the escencial and fundamentals of the music from scrash. It gives the nature of every single element used in music.It is an expensive book, because it comes with a CD also. But it is worthful."
2,Broken?,"When I bought this toy for my little sister, I was anticipating how happy she would be when she opened the box, but she wasn't happy because the toy was broken! My friend bought the same toy for her little sister and hers was also broken. Coincidence? I think not. This is a junky toy. You may have the ""pleasure"" of playing with it for five or ten minutes before it is in the garbage! I found it a waste of my hard-earned money! I hope no one makes the same mistake I did!"
1,Eurocentric,"Readers should be aware that this book is often cited as an egregious example of racist views that ignore the Native Americans' point of view. See ""Rethinking Columbus"", by Bill Bigelow."
4,Great swing!,"The swing is is of great quality and very sturdy. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it doesn't come with clips to hang it. We used the clips from one of the standard swings we took off. Otherwise, we're very happy with it!"
4,wish these were for walkers.,my daughter (11 mos) is walking already and I wish these had tread on the bottom. But we do love them and they fit her great. Ordered a size 4.
3,Lighten up People!!,"This movie really is not that bad. It all depends on what kind of movie you like. If your touchy and don't like violence, don't see this movie, but if your in the mood for something that is not mainstream, by all means have some fun and see this movie. You have to realize that this is not meant to be taken seriously, and those who do will be disapointed. I liked this movie because it was funny, not in a nice way, but hey, who cares? Don't listen to these other people, they can't see beyond their own opinions enough to judge fairly. See it for yourself and then decide. This is a movie for fans of black comedy, who dislike their siblings, and love Keanu. It's not the greatest film, and was not meant to be, but it is certainly not as bad as these people are saying."
4,Feel It For Yourself!,Yet another example of why you should always seek a third opinion-YOUR OWN!-and not listen exclusively to video rating encyclos or your friends-even those with compatible tastes to yours-when it comes to critically lacerated movies. The entire cast does an impressive job-esp. Keanu-you can really FEEL for this likeable miscreant!I just rented it from the public library but I'm going to buy it and I would recommend doing the same!
2,Pitiful,"This movie is awful. There were a few (very few!) funny parts, but for the most part it was just plain idiotic. The quality was even worse. Looked like someone shot it on a cheap camcorder. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,A Rather Boring Collection of 'Jokes',"I must admit that I have never held Oscar Wilde in much esteem as a serious writer. My sister is a fan and she bought this book. I had a browse through and it is what I had expected. This book will appeal to those who imagine themselves as intelligent and sophisticated. Although they may be entertained, they will learn nothing of consequence. Do not be fooled by Wilde's pseudo-philosophical style. There is nothing to be gained from a reading of this book besides mild, and brief, entertainment, or the satisfaction of knowing you can apprieciate the wit of a supposed intellectual, who is in fact nothing of the sort.I would also like to correct a mistake I noticed in a previous review. Oscar Wilde is not an 'English Gentleman' - He is in fact from Ireland."
5,Works,Ease Pain works very well. I had two bad shoulders and this cd helped me to learn to live with the pain and work through it.I highly recommend it.
4,Clarence Greenwood is ....................,"way underrated !! A lot of reviews I read indicate that Citizen Cope's music is nothing new and/or special. It may not be revolutionary, but his music is some of the best that I've heard in the past few years. It's a great mix of soul, funk, pop, and ballads. This is a great album and is very catchy, but if you like this one in the least bit, I highly recommend his previous self titled album. The lyrics are great and the songs very emotional in nature....one of the best cd's I own. You will not be disappointed."
1,Listen to the COPY RIGHT notices,"I like the guy.. The album is decent.. Not great, but good enough that I've gone out of my way to listen to certain tracks over and over....BUT... and this is a BIG BUTT... The copyright protection is total bullshiat. You can't put this album on your computer, ipod, pace maker, etc.. It is extremely annoying and enough for me to call SKUNK at this stink bomb... DON""T BUY THIS ALBUM.. SET A PRECENDENCE that it is not OK for artists or record labels to determine ""how"" we are supposed to listen to them. This is not ok."
3,good stuff,"A lot of reviewers say it sounds like a lot of things... but it sounds reggae-ish to me. There's a lot of repetition and I'm not overly fond of Clarence's voice, but this is a good album. There are a lot of good songs here. I like *Son's Gonna Rise*, *Bullet and Target* and I think my favorite was *Hurrican Waters.* It's worth a listen."
5,Brilliant Songwriter,"He's an incredible lyricists and a great vocalist. The style is not particularly original but it doesn't need to be. I don't normally like the singer-songwriter with a guitar model of making music, but Citizen Cope is on point."
2,Filler...filler...filler....,"Never judge a book by it's cover...as an author this can't be stressed enough...as a reader, I couldn't resist! Unfortunately, I was wrong in this case. The cover was awesome and promised a haunting tale that the story just didn't deliver. I thought I'd never finish this book! It grabbed my attention at the beginning, but by the third chapter, I felt as if I had read the same thing over and over. This happens throughout much of the book as Mr. Saul builds to the stories climax. This could have been a very good psychological thriller and a real page-turner, if it had been told in half the length. Instead I found myself putting it down and walking away, waiting sometimes days before I picked it up again then once again becoming frustrated with the same scenario's, bearing slightly different descriptions. This is a classic example of once hitting the best seller list, always remaining there...we should all be so lucky!"
1,Truely Shocked,"I cannot believe the number of good reviews this *horrible* book received. I have to confess that this is my first John Saul, but after the trite subject matter and tedious writing style (""his body began to respond to her touch"") of Nightshade, I don't dare read another. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME."
1,Tense - and miserably implausible,"A fine narration of a miserably implausible story that just gets worse as goes on. The main human characters' actions in this ""ghost story"" are blitheringly unbelievable. There's enough mystery and tension make you trudge on to the finale but it's an utterly unsatisfying experience that gets worse after yu've finished and consider how awful and completely unbelievable the actors and actions."
2,"Sorry, I thought this a very contrived story","Reading the other reviews posted for this book I realize I am not in the majority, however, I did not find this book entertaining at all. The author went to too many extremes with the characters in their actions and reactions. I found it unbelievable that Emily could be so ill with Alzheimers and Joan still felt compelled to care for her...as if she was convinced she could handle that type of situation . The nightmares of Matt and the total snub by his friends after Bill was killed were very unrealiatic.I did not like this book at all."
3,This movie was ok,"This movie was pretty boring, but the only thing that saved it was Anthony Hopkins. So if you really like Anthony Hopkins then see this movie."
1,Kingston 1 GB Micro SD Card (Retail Package) - DO NOT BUY THIS,"Worked for a week and then keep getting ""card not ready"" error. Tried putting in and out, rebotting ...DOES NOT WORK. I wish I could get a refund."
1,ipod car transmitter,"I was truly disappointed. It didn't work well, the music was cutting in and out."
5,absolutely perfect...,I almost baught a $50 Micro SD card at Best Buy for 256mb's. SO GLAD i didn't. this card was SUPER cheap... and got here fast! even for the holiday. And it works perfectly!! it's tiny and hard to handle.. but it goes in and has worked ever since! :-)...
5,Great little tiny winy flash drive,It is fantastic how fast and worthy is this little flash drive.Great!
5,Work very good on my phone!,"I would to say it came in the mail on time, and I put it in my nokia phone and it works like a charm. No trouble with it so far. And you can't beat the price."
5,As Good Today....,I have a copy of this book from the 70's. I happened upon it last night and showed it to my 20 year old son. What happened to the cover with the hippies on it? It is a really fun book that I think todays young hippies and homesteaders could learn from. I recomend it along with Alicia BAy Laurels clasic LIving on the Earth. Christa
3,average,It's the history of marijuana the cd skips alittle bit but then its good for being used overall wasn't worth the price
2,The show is great but....,"I really do not understand why the first four seasons had subtitles in Spanish and the fifth no, that demerits how incredibly good it is this season, and especially its dramatic end. Too bad really."
5,quantum leap fifth season,very good show. the product was in great condition and was sent quickly to my home. will buy from this person/company again!
4,Good-bye To All That,"Obviously a must read for all Graves fans and pre-world war Britain. Later chapters will be worth the wait for World War I fans. The reading is clear, fluid, and to the point; making it am excellent reference to the war. I gave it four stars since I am not a Robert Graves fan; although he seemed like a nice bloke."
2,This book is waaaay overrated,"I was really looking forward to reading this book and had, indeed, wanted to read it for years. I expected a bittersweet telling of how the author went from true believing to disillusionment with British society and British militarism.What I saw instead was a rather flat telling of the author's life before and during the Great War that dwelt on the fact that he was in the British upper class, had an upperclass accent, went to an upper class school and was an officer in an elite regiment. He comes across as a terrible, unlikeable snob.What a disappointment."
5,cleans boots well.,"I bought this for my landscape business. When my employees use it, it does a great job."
1,Horrível,"Bem...o que dizer dessa decepcionante gravao de Serse...Von Otter está lastimável como Serse...fiquei o tempo todo procurando a excepcional Dejanira de Hercules, e a adorável Cornélia de Giulio Cesare...onde foram parar a ornamentao, a sensibilidade e sentimento dos ""da capo""...péssima...Norberg-Shultz deveriam ter se restrito a continuar gravando pra Naxos, assim seríamos poupados do seu vibrato horrível...Dois cantores apenas se salvam...Zazzo e Piau, o primeiro promete ser um melhor Serse que a protagonista da gravao, e Piau como sempre é adorável. O resto é o resto"
1,What a hassle,Ordered a new book and was sent a obviously used book. Had the hassle of returning then had to pay more for the replacement.
4,fun...good graphics...but difficult,"This game is fun...and I've been working on it for awhile. It's a bit difficult and at times, the camera angles can be off. I haven't gotten though the whole game yet, but my fiance and I are working at it..(the 2 player game)One of the really cool things about this game, IS the two player option....it's fun to have a buddy to play with.I have to say that I didn't like this game as much as ""the two towers"" but it rocked all the same. I would have given 5 stars, but the gameplay is just a little *too* difficult and the levels a little *too* long to get 5 stars. Get it, play it!!! YEHAW"
1,Sucked,Game would be awesome... If it worked but it doesn't. I've tried it in original Xbox and in three different Xbox 360. These ppl sell bad games knowingly.
1,"Spike, what were you thinking ?","The story is very ludicrous because it never spends time building the characters ... which takes talent on the part of the director. Spike ! What were you thinking ?The dialogs are lame (perhaps a reflection of our lack of emphasis on education in the US). Older movies have such powerful dialogs that make you say ""Wow ! I must use that sometime !"".One star for Inside Man."
1,HORRIBLE.,This movie was a WASTE of 2 hours.Horrible plot.Horrible music.Horrible character development.Horrible cinematography.Horrible random pointless scenes.Horrible beginning.Horrible middle.Horrible ending.Horrible movie.My favorite part about this film is writing this review.
3,Spike Lee Dropped The Ball. It Could've Been Great.,"I don't write spoilers. A good plot, keeps you guessing. A plot flaw or three in the mix, but not terminal. The fatal flaw? No climax, & no final explanation. Unbelievable... Too many loose ends, unexplained motives, & no closure = take a pass on this one. On the bright side. I only paid 75 cents plus shipping for it :-). It was worth that much. I'll use my imagination to show how badly Spike Lee dropped the ball, here."
4,I really enjoyed it!,"Really! What more can you say about some movies? You either enjoyed it, liked the cast, the premise, didn't regret the time or money spent...or...you didn't.I read several of the reviews...mostly 1 or 5 star ones. The 5 star generally sound like paid adverts and 1 stars probably wouldn't like a movie about their own grandmothers and would complain that the mole on her face was one centimeter out of line and had a tinge of green rather than black.I'm not a critic...though I can be critical. I don't like my time wasted. I like Denzel ( I like to think we're on a first name basis even if he has no idea I exist.) I like Spike Lee. I really liked the movie...it moved, it twisted, it sometimes contorted...and the music rocked me."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I saw this at the movies and loved it, so I gladly bought it on disc, but when I re watched it I found myself getting bored, the movie seemed to drag on and on.My wife and son felt the same, all 3 of us couldn't wait for the movie to end, very strange considering we all loved it on the big screen."
2,Barely above terrible,"Spike Lee is not intelligent enough as a director to tackle the many disjointed plot lines of this film. In one scene you'll have a cliche filled mess regarding how Muslims are treated by the police. Then in the next, he's trying to create an intellectual battle between Washington and Owen. Believe it or not, despite the fact that there is so much going on, the entire film just feels so, well, boring. Jody Foster is a pointless addition, and after about 35 minutes you're still waiting for something to improve...but....it never does. I'll give it 2 stars simply because I love bank robbery movies, but this one might just be the worst on record. Even Denzel seems to be stumbling through this role, I haven't figured out why he ever agreed to take it on. Stick to mindless UFC and car chases Spikey, because serious directing eludes you."
3,Overrated,"I usually check several movie sites for reviews before watching a movie. This one has an amazingly high rating. I guess my expectations were set too high.This is an ""OK"" movie and I don't regret that I spent time watching it. The cast is good, but the plot is just falling apart. The police looked quite stupid (I mean, they couldn't tell the difference between a dialog and a monolog, and didn't check what exactly the criminals were giving them, ""not a bomb"" was good enough...) and most of the time the main investigator simply didn't do anything. Do they really start planning an attack at the last moment, not as soon as the hostages are taken? Can someone come into the building with hostages and remain totally unnoticed, like Madeline did? Where did all the journalists go? Looked the other way at that moment? And so on...When I see a crime thriller with good reviews and high ratings, I expect an exceptionally good plot. But this one was, well, an exception."
3,A different Denzel Washingtom?,"I've come to expect exciting movies from this guy. It is delivered here, but is some distance from his best."
2,ok,So so movie - interesting intro but it degraded into boring scripts -- actually not too bad but I didn't have the patience so fast forward came handy before she leaves.
3,Good,"Buyers should be sure of the actors in the movie. There are 2 movies named Inside Man. I was lucky to get the right one, but unaware there were two out there."
3,We've been down that road before. Same old same old.,"I figured a movie with Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Clive Owen that it could be one to rememeber or have some replay value. I was wrong. A very predictable same old tune type of movie. Denzel is one of my favorite actors but he is above this movie. Absolutely nothing here to get you on the edge whatsoever. Spike Lee's racial undertones throughout the movie is very annoying and is just not neccessary. A little humour throughout the movie helps a bit but I am still disappointed with this one. This is the fourth movie Denzel has made with Spike Lee. Lets hope its his last. As one of the premier actors in Hollywood, he deserves better."
5,Excellent,"The inside man is modern but has what was great about the golden era of movies. Essentially a really clever bank robbery plot, it has a moral peice behind the motivation for the crime and a sense of justice to the whole thing. The cast is tremendous including Clive Owen, Denzeil Washington and Jodie Foster who all performed up to their reputations. This is a great entertainment experience, there is nothing trendy, nothing weird just a really clever story told by a great story teller in Spike Lee.This is a film well worth seeing"
4,Shipping was not too great,I love this perfume cauz its truly awesome ..I made sure that my boyfriend makes the most out of it ;) He is charming and this suits him soo very much.I hated the fact that the order was shipped with billing details in spite of mentioning that this is a gift order .They even missed my gift message for the order .
4,A great gift.,"I ordered this item for a friend of mine, and he loves it. It's his favorite scent and he's very happy to have the shower gel and aftershave to accompany the cologne. The picture is a little deceiving in that there was no toiletry bag included, but hardly anything to fuss over. Still a great value for what you're getting, and Burberry Brit is one of the greatest smelling colognes(and perfumes) out there, with its wonderfully clean scent. Highly recommended!"
4,Heart of a Champion,"Heart of a Champion was a very life like book. I recomend this book to anyone who likes real life storys. Carl Deuker writes some of the best books that I've ever read. A breif summery of this book, a boy's father had died in a hotel and this kid goes to the park every day and finally meets a kid who asks him if he wants to play baseball, and the dad was a drunk who always got mad at his son. If you liked this book so far you are going to love the rest of the book."
3,Baseball,"I think this book was good, but it's also pretty sad because one person dies, some people have drinking problems, and one family divorces. The good things about the book are that the baseball games were exciting, and the book also taught how to play baseball in a good way. The book also showed that friendship is good to have because in this book a friend always came to his friend for help."
5,Heart of a Champion,"""Your every day life decisions can choose your fate."" The book Heart of a Champion was written by: Carl Deuker. It is about a boy named Seth and his friend Jimmy. They both are trying to succeed and achieve there goal of playing professional baseball. I would recommend this book for kids who enjoy reading about baseball. What I liked about this book was they talked a lot about baseball. What I didn't like about the book was the things Jimmy was doing throughout the story. Another good book written by: Carl Deuker is Runner. This author is into baseball. Read this book and see if Jimmy and Seth can take there team to the championship game."
3,Don't join the big show for the wrong reason,"I expected more. I expected much better. Sophie's parents don't discuss plans, Sophie runs away with expectations, then manages to manipulate people and the media enough to get her domestic elephant sent back to Africa? Let's go the next step; zoos are also all un-natural and unfair and expensive so lets send all the animals home. I don't think so. But lots of kids will after watching this. You want a circus move; buy Toby Tyler. It has no other objectives than to tell a story."
3,army of me/cactus patch,"i saw these guys a few years ago at warped tour and hfstival, when they were cactus patch (which i kind of like better as a name, but it's still cool). the first time i saw them i was kind of blown away, they were really great live and i had never listened to them before so it was a whole new experience to me. they had a lot of energy and their melodic sound and catchy riffs made a lasting impression. the second time i saw them, i bought their cd (which i think is s/t as cactus patch--it's the one where they're mowing the lawn on the front). i listen to it all the time, still. check these guys out, they're great. and if you can see them live definately do that.ps the lead singer vince is cute too, he's got the cutest red hair."
5,A collection of Tennyson's best,This is one of the best collections of Tennyson's poems I have ever read. Tennyson's wonderful poems are artfully compiled into this book. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Tennyson's poetry or just wants to see what its all about.
1,not good,I bought the triple box set of three english version tinto brass movies & none of them are worth watching including this one. If you are buying tinto movies stick to the italian versions.
2,not really punk,I order this thinking it would be some raw footage of punk bandsturns out most the bands on this dvd suckthere is one jesus lizard video which I thought was coolMost of the videos on this dvd you can see on youtubethey are all mtv type music videosnothing underground about this
2,Painful,"...This is a film that you hate to criticize because it is apparent that it was filmed with good intentions, excellent production values and good acting. But the painful truth is that it is an awfully slow movie (at times excruciating but you keep thinking that it might pick up - it doesn't), and there are very few laughs in it. The funniest thing about it is the fact that Megan Mullaly is given the starring credit on the dvd box and she has a total of about three lines and less than three minutes of screen time! Talk about false advertising! So what if the film has no offensive language or violence? Those factors alone do not make a good film."
1,"The most anglophile, biased book of this decade","The title of this book is misleading, since it is actually about British tactics and their experiences. The cover of the book is also misleading, depicting Prussian infantry - this is about British! The author has relied on British witnesses and sources, who are of course always accurate, correct, and reliable. Sources, books, and opinions from somewhere other than England are labelled as much less reliable, sometimes ridiculed. Incredible arrogance.From the perspective of the sideshow in Peninsula, the author generalizes about Napoleonic Wars which took place in Central Europe.British victories got prolonged descriptions and quotations, whereas the victories over the British are shortened, described in a much less interesting way or ridiculed.I have not seen such an anglophile book for quite a long time."
1,Love,"Waterloo Industry at work. The British are cute,or tough, and winners, whatever. It doesn't matter that they failed with invasion in 1806, they failed with invasion on Walcheren, that they failed in Spain in 1809, 250-mile desperate retreat before Napoleon, and a hurried embarking in La Coruna,a la Dunkirk! It doesn't matter that they lost at Talavera, it doesn't matter that Ney inflicted higher casualties on Wellington, than his own at Quatre Brass. It doesn't matter that Wellington messed up his concentration in 1815 despite of being the best informed of all commanders. Wellington is untouchable, and shining like a holy Madonna.Author goes orgasmic about the British.French, Russians, Austrians, Prussians?-I don't feel the love."
3,The Best LOTR Game,"I'm not a big fan of this game but it's definately alot better than the other 2 (especially the first one, one of the worst games ever in my opinion). I love the books and the movies were great but the games I wasn't impressed with. A plus on this one is that it will give you a challenge at times. This is definately worth renting but not worth buying."
4,i think this is a good game until you play as sam,the game is awsome. co-op is sweet until you have to play as Sam and Merry than the game turns gay.but it is worth playing as Arogorn and Legolaswith my friend was so fun.the mind less killing is the best part. when they swan and you just kill it is defenatly worth it all.when you play as Sam and Merry you go through some really gay levels there is no mindless killing. you die way to easy and are weak as hell. but the begining is fun as a MOFO so i think it is worth buying for the begining
2,It has great battling,"IF you like fighting in videogames you should check out this game. The fighting is spectacular. You just beat down those orcs with your arrows and swords, its a really fun time. The orcs are different and have different features. Also whats new from the Two Towers version is the you have more characters to play with, especially Gandalf. But, most of these characters exept for Gandalf are unlock until later in the game which is unfortunate. It doesn't follow the movie like I thought it would. But, you can see clips from the Return of the King movie mixed in with the game. The reason i hate this game is because when your playing two player campaign you have to save on two different files and it gets mixed up all the time. The saving system is a joke. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME. It's horrible."
4,A fun action game,"While there are more characters to play then the two towers, they do not feel a whole lot different. Also, I still feel less like I'm in the movie but in certain scenes from the movie as the cutting is large and continunity is off. But it is fun, and I like the multiple players options. Recomended."
4,"Cool game, but a few things I'd change...","I think this game is very cool! Like one review said, it only takes a few day to defeat. Well, so does the Two Towers and it was a good game. One thing I don't like about this game, instead of the health at the top of the screen, it's at the bottom. I don't think you can see the screen as well as you could with the Two Towers.I do like how you can play as all the different characters. Here are characters that you couldn't play with in the Two Towers that you can now: Sam, Frodo, and Gandalf. I can tell you this, they all have some moves, and since this game is two-player than you can play with groups of Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam. But, you don't have to play with two people if you don't want to.Here's the point, this game might not be as good as The Two Towers to me, but it does have a lots of cool features! And the graphics are so... awesome. Anybody who loves the Two Towers game, will also love this one!"
5,LOTR,"Great game. At first this game is hard, but it gets easyer as you go on.codes don't work, you don't need them any way...g2g back to class"
4,"Hard, but still great to play!","Man, this game was hard! my dad and I took a while to finish it. I like that you can buy different weapons. This is probably the most channelganing Xbox game we have.I like it and I think anyone should get it. It really follows up the movie. And as a girl, this is not too hard to play if you have someone with you!"
5,INSIDER'S VIEW OF HOLLYWOOD LEGEND?,"This is the book someone within the movie industry wrote or to which they contributed their undiluted insights. Unlike so many James Dean biographies, this one--despite its snide tone--shows a distinct recollection of events in the world of movies decades ago. Dean had more than a few associates and friends who might offer their opinions at this point. This book gives the 50th anniversary look at James Dean and seems to be told from the perspective of one of the many actors who burned themselves out trying to imitate their idol, or someone who was set up by the studios to be the next Dean clone. If you want to know something about the unvarnished James Dean, this book is for you. If you are looking for a sweet and romanticized portrait of a cad, this book isn't for you. It is a page-turner that will have you laughing out loud with recognition of those weak attempts of star-struck actors trying to be the next James Dean."
3,Men against Fire,"Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle CommandOnce you read the excellent introduction, it is difficult to escape serious doubts about the methodology of the exposition and conclusions."
3,Disappointing,I choose this as a guideline for organizing my autobiography for my familyand found it lacking in detail and parts that I had hoped for.
2,Literally Ridiculous,5o seemed to be sleeping when he made this.I love the songs but what was the point of this. Three tracks!Come on man whats up with that.Two out of three of the songs where tight.What messed it up was it only had three tracks.Also 8 mile road the G-unit remix is cheesy after listening to it once.I loved Get Rich or die tryin which deserves 5 Stars but The New Breed Is very stressing.
3,Good story turned to disappointing drivel,"I enjoyed reading about Waylon's experiences and relationships until he got bogged down in the drugs of which he is so proud. Those chapters truly made for boring reading. He could have condensed the experience, acknowledged how much he hurt those who loved him, and then moved on. Instead, he seems to revel in reliving those painful details and doesn't regret his behavior. Jessi deserves more gratitude than he expresses toward her. The book was often disjointed and it was hard to follow the chronology of events. With the last half condensed into 2-3 chapters, it would have been a great story."
3,Sure that Hank Done it This Way,"The book details how Waylon became used but not used up through a series of exploits--many shameful. Extensive womanizing back when he truly was lonesome, ornery, and mean left many good-hearted women heartbroken. Waylon didn't have to reveal so much dirty linen from his past, but at least now we can be certain he had always been crazy but it kept him from going insane. He could and probably should have shown more regrets for some erstwhile indiscretions, but most likely his legacy will not forfeit the love of the common people because country's fans are loyal to a fault.Even if he thought he was too dumb for New York City and too ugly for L.A., he and many of his contemporary honky tonk heroes have considerably more talent than most of those warmed over rockers played on country radio today. The autobiography conclusively proves that we may have lost the wolf, but the wolf's music will survive."
5,Moving book,"This book by Waylon about his life is up front and honest. He tells of his life before and after Jessie. Some of the language is out of bounds, but that's Waylon telling the story. He was and always will be the best. His book tells about the hardships as a child, his involvment with drugs, and his ability to get off the drugs. Pictures in the book are great. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Waylon Jennings. Top notch"
4,WWforlife,Good workout. The two instructors provide lots of options for different levesl of fitness. I was really sweating after the sprints. Good for me because alone on my treadmill I won't sprint. The workout with weights was also a great change from the regular routine of walking on a treadmill for 45 minutes.
2,Not very durable at all,"I got a mr. fantastic for my five year old who doesnt have anywhere near the muscle strength of the kids pulling on this toy in the commercial. Mr. Fantastic's arms and legs tore opened the second day we had this toy. My son didnt even get to stretch him far at all and his arms and legs tore and the gel leaked out and gets him and everything it touches extremely sticky. The arms and legs didnt tear off but just got cracks that leak continously. Before it ripped I thought this was a great toy because it was fun and it has great resistance to give the hand and arm muscles a good workout. My son loved it and was soo disappointed that Im going back to the store to exchange it for another, if that one stays together then I will assume my first purchase was just defective."
1,Don't believe it!!,This toy leaked the first day my son had it. He did not abuse this toy he simply pulled the arms and it leaked and had a hole in the arm.
5,twin troubles,"I thought this book was excellent,it was very funny.It had so many funny bits that i had to read it again and again.It is definatly worth a read."
4,Good,"The book is about two twins who want to sing and dance, so they get a train down to London and there is a happy ending. So, maybe the book has a bit more to it but thats practically the main story! See ya!"
2,Tales From The Neverending Story - The Beginning,"Tales From The Neverending Story - The Beginning is a mediocre adaption of Never Ending story. The acting is wodden and the dialogue feels stilted. The costuming and the music is not bad. However, when I remeber what an amazing movie the original by Wolfgang Petersen then this movie just does not cut it. I really wanted to like this movie but I simply could not. It was just too mediocre for my taste. Not the worst adaptation I have seen but still I can not give it more then 2/5. 2/5."
3,fun,"I found this movie very entertaining. Yes, some of the elements have been changed from the original videos, so what. I thought the take on this one was interesting. Every storyteller is different and one person will see a story from a different point of view. Sometimes it is difficult to put a book into a movie form. Scenes which work in a book don't neccessarily work in a movie studio even with today's technology. If you don't get to hung up on sticking to the orginal version you will enjoy this movie. The only thing I didn't like was being left hanging until the next part comes out. But, on the other hand I will watch for it and buy it just to see what happens next."
4,brings back memories...but,"while i was pleased to locate this movie and it was just as campy and wonderful as i remembered, i wish they would have released a better transfer..it was rather muddy and choppy but overall was still watchable.. i wish a pre-requisite for any dvd would be it's transfer quality..im still giving it 4 stars because the movie itself was so much fun."
1,Quality is a problem,"The cheezy flicks video was truly acceptable except that the film lost sound completely for the last quarter of the film. Not a polished transfer, but certainly acceptable, if only the sound portion was complete. Had to return the film."
1,Movie made twice - this is the bad version,"Two movies were made based on Wyndham's wonderful book. This is the pitiful one. This movie bears virtually no relationship to the book with a radically changed (and ruined) plot.If you can find the OTHER version, buy it -- quite good.Keywords for the bad version - made in 1963, Howard Keel, sailor and lighthouse."
1,"beware ""Cheezy Flicks"" dvd","Beware the Cheezy Flicks dvd -- my copy (bought NEW) has no audio for the last reel (approx. the last 20 minutes), and the film fades in and out of clarity throughout!"
3,Day of the Triffids,"This is such a classic ""monsters from space"" film. Of course, you have to really love corny monster movies from the 50s era to truly enjoy it. Unfortunately, the last 20-30 minutes of the film had no sound."
1,"Wonderful book, horrible movie.","Once upon a time John Wyndham wrote a book about societal follies setting up the world for disaster on a grand scale. Something went wrong, and it all fell apart. This movie isn't that story, although it shares the same name and has flesh-eating plants. Apparently it wasn't acceptable for our own technology to destroy us so the world goes blind from a meteor shower and the plants are from outer space. The acting is typical British for the era and genre, but nothing could have saved this movie. Others have mentioned the BBC mini-series that followed the book quite well, slowly ramping up the true horror of the situation. If you can find a copy get that instead. It's only available for the British market but it's worth finding an all-region DVD player for. Or just read the book - it's still legal to do that."
2,"bad zippers, not very waterproof","I bought these to replace a very long lived pair of leather chaps.With less than 1 year on the pants, the left leg zipper started to fail. With 18 months on them, both zippers regularly pull apart. The problem is, the leg zippers are the fine toothed ""waterproof"" zippers, instead of heavy duty zippers. Those zippers are fine for short runs, but for 26""+ long leg zippers, they just can't stand up to regular usage. My Tourmaster jacket has a heavy duty primary zipper, and it works wonderfully. I just don't know why Tourmaster decided to go with these small-tooth zippers for the legs.To add insult to injury, the crotch of the pants was only waterproof for the first month or so. After that, any water that pooled between the seat and my legs quickly left me with wet shorts underneath.I stayed about as dry in my chaps, and the zippers on those held up for over 8 years."
2,not really worth the money,"This book doesn't come close to being true to it's title. Simple? I think not. The ""patterns"" are more on the confusing side of things, and as one reviewer mentioned, seemed to be more like guidelines rather than actual patterns. There were only two projects in the whole book that even appealed to me; the aran armchair cover and the flower trimmed evening bag. If you have a more ecclectic flair you might find this book to your liking. The pictures in the book also tend to show a close up view of the project without showing you what the whole project looks like completed. I would recommend checking it out from the library first and to leaf through to see if it is your kind of book, otherwise you might end up just as disappointed as me."
1,Do not compare hunger and starvation to putting,"""Chapter Three The Context From Dependency to Self-Reliance ... They tell me that from 1975 to 1995 they thought the source of chronic hunger to be simply the absence of food. ... Aid workers reconceived their role ... empowering host country men and women ... Just as the people in the underdeveloped countries grew to become self-directed and self-reliant, it's possible for golfers to become self-coaching -- able to guide their own development.""From 1975 to 1995 world politics changed so that aid workers could change. And this still has nothing to do with putting.The authors come across as self important and try to make golf more important than it is."
2,Somewhat sick,"2 1/2Worth getting for the great first track, but unnecesary because of the other two. Salvage as a single file if possible."
4,las thouse on left 2??,"Obviously inpsired by Last House, this is a cool Italian expoitation genre flick.Quite disturbing, and more darker in tone believe it or not the Last hosue. Superb music too by none other than Ennio Morricone.check it out if you like European genre films!"
4,Best so far on old xbox,The song choice is great including some of the more classic songs from older DDR games like butterfly. One of my more favorites of the DDR series on xbox.
3,Good show. Setlist looks better than it really is,"Yes, this show is superb, I concur. But of the 100 or so shows that I own, this one is nothing special. If you're looking for a solid Livephish album, go with either #1, 2, 6, 10, or 19.The horns in this show take away from its greatness. Phish really is not a band that sounds fantastic with horns. There are a few songs that sound good with horns, mainly the more jazzy ones (Buried Alive and Flat Fee), but overall Phish should lose Giant Country Horns. The horns take away from songs like Gin, Bowie, and AC/DC. The true highlight of the show is Tweezer. Tweezer is always significantly awesome. As well as Frankenstein. That song rocks and always will.Basically, buy Livephish #2. The best one, setlist-wise and musically (hands down)."
3,Helpful to have around,"If anyone ever told you that your code was ugly, then this book is for you. If you want the correct way to implement the IDisposable interface, or construct a singleton object in a multi-threaded environment, then this book is for you.Many of the details outlined in this book, anyone who has been writing software, even for 6 months, will have a grasp on. There are a few thing that are interesting, but they are things that you would google for."
5,Health In A Can,"I bought a case of these and have really been enjoying them! Delicious, wholesome flavor, taste more natural than standard store-bought canned fish. Since there is no salt added, I mix anchovies with this salmon, and enjoy the combination. I like my fish salty. Highly recommend this brand!-------J. Lehman"
4,not great but pretty good,"It's good enough that we've bought three or four cases over the last year. It's clean, healthful and generally mild-flavored. We have found no better canned pink wild salmon in the U.S., although we have found better Alaskan canned salmon in the UK and Canada."
4,Perfect for salt-free diets. Bones aren't a problem.,"I bought this tuna wondering about the bones because of what I'd read elsewhere. Yes, the tuna comes with some bones. But you must understand they are so soft as to literally disintegrate when you squeeze them (really!), and the bones contain important calcium your body needs. I regularly make salmon cakes (same recipe as crab cakes except with salmon) and by the time they are cooked, the bones just blend in with the rest of the salmon and you don't even detect them. Hard to believe but true! And good for you! Don't let the fact that bones and skin are included scare you away. I do remove some of the skin, even though it contains omega-3 fatty acids, but I leave the bones."
1,Disappointed,"Low salt was the only benefit this product offered. The salmon itself was the center spine section. Lots of spine, lots of bones, lots of work to eat. Quite a mess and disappointment. Not the typical sections of salmon most of us are used to buying in either canned or smoked salmon."
1,Barely even used it,"Thank goodness I got it cheap. I was required for a class, but really I could just go online to translate any words I needed.The product is good if you need it, but if you are looking at it as an aid for a Spanish class, you might want to just try an online translator or friend who speaks Spanish."
4,Good value on text book,I took Spanish after many years away from school and found this book very helpful and the price was great.
5,Well Worth It,"I saw Gigi Dover at Merlefest this past year. I was actually only walking around between stages and heard her sing. Right away I picked up on her amazing voice and talent. As soon as she had finished performing I ran off and bought this cd and have been a huge fan ever since. She has a very soulful and emotional voice.This album is one of my favorites of all time. Even though I'm not crazy about ""Countin' Crazies"" or ""Beatty Drive"", ""No Need"" and the rest of the album more than make up for it."
5,WAY better than the movie,"as you know, I am a BIG Disney fan, BUT this book is so much better than the movie - can't tell you, you must read it! the wonder and excitement and the MAGIC.I used to read books like this for hours, lost in imagination. great book, and when reading try not to think of Angela Landsbury...a must have for the family bookshelf.ss"
1,Yuck!!!,"Bought the circus peanuts to put in party gift bags, when I received them they were hard as a rock. Can't use them and too much trouble to return. Very disappointed!"
5,Great recipes that really work,"For a diner lover and a baking amateur (me), Diner Desserts has been a big success. I usually get something from a bakery when I have people over. But the last two times, I made desserts from this book (toasted almond cake (unbelievable!) and apple pie with cheddar cheese crust-the best apple pie recipe I've made). My friends were really impressed. The results will remind you of diner desserts, but taste a lot better. I think its because the recipes are so clear. If you're looking for something trendy or fancy, this isn't the right place. In the beginning of the book the author says ""Napoleons, profiteroles, and other staples of haute cuisine found on the menus of highbrow restaurants are not diner fare"""
5,Best game I probaly own,"This game is probably the best game I ever bought. Even though I got the game two years (2005) after it came out(2003) I never get bored of playing it. You can choose difficulty levels by the type of broom. Comet 260-begginer, Nimbus 2000- a little harder, Nimbus 2001- hard, Firebolt-Expert. You also get to play in the Hogwarts cup and the quiditch world cup. Which is ver cool! I don't know why they didn't include ireland in the game but it is still good. At the begginging you have to do a 6 challenges and than you can start playing. You can also play in Exibition mode (2 player mode) Which is hard and fun if you are playing against someone who is just as good as you. P.S. I bought the game and didn.t open it yet but researched it and played it at my friends houses so much I know all this. P.S.S It is very cheap right now."
4,"Dang, it's sad the talented ones don't last","I know i'm extremely late but I was honestly scared to purchase this album. I thought ""Day and Night"" and ""Single By Myself"" would be the only hot songs but boy was I wrong. The whole album is dope. My fav songs are of course ""Day and Night"" (remix), ""No Na Na"" and ""Beautiful U"". I have tried to find it everywhere after I got so tired on listening to the plain, run-of-the-mill R&B chicks out today. I don't care if you can dance, I need some more substance. These girls are very talented and very deserving of the Lady of Soul Award they won. I wish more people, (myself included) would have supported them from the outset."
3,a Good cd by four hot girls,Everyone should get this because it's a good cd My jam is Called holla at me WHenever things go bad It can lift me up.
4,Good CD!,"Isyss and their debut CD is a smash! The best feature on this CD would have to be the title track ""The Way We Do Pt.2"" and the ballands such as ""Beautiful U"". The only set back to this album is the lead singer. She has a good voice but she seemes to have the ever popular Beyonce ""yell"" syndrome. The songs are well written and the beats are perfect. Some of the choice cuts are:'Beautiful U', 'No She Didn't', 'Holla At Me', 'Day & Night' remix & original. The whole CD is just great to listen to the whole way through and I wolud call anyone crazy who doesn't like it. The group has alot of potential and I hopr they don't become a one hit wonder like most of the debut groups do. Isyss has talent and this CD really shows that talent off."
4,Very Impressive Debut...But their talent is being slept on!!,"I always was fond of Isyss ever since I saw their video on BET ""Day & Night""! I thought that these girls were talented,had style and they could sing!!! They are very beautiful and it's a shame that they're probably going to go down in 1- hit wonderland. i mean these girls have the production and the record label(ARISTA) to make it. Arista is a record label that is known 4 having legendary artists e.g.Whitney Houston, Usher,Tlc,Toni Braxton, but Arista is also known for constantly signing new artists e.g.Nodeesha, Tha Rayne, Natasha. Which 9i s probably why ISYSS is being ignored. Their album was hot, not 2 mention two hot videos an enhanced CD and hot tracks! Anyway I hope these girls make a new album because they have talent, voices and the looks!"
3,A Teenage Love,"If I were a few years younger then this CD would have gotten a 4 to 5 star rating. These ladies can sing and I will give them credit! However, most of the lyrics are dealing with ""Young Love"" and ""Juvenile Situations"" and I am so over that stage in my life. I did find a few hot tracks, which made the CD, purchase worth it. ""Day & Night"" (Original and Remix), ""Single For The Rest Of My Life"", ""Beautiful U"" and ""Message 2 U"". Vocally the group is respectable, however lyrically they need to mature for my personal taste."
3,double end speed ball for boxing,"Strong material,but i was not happy with the 2 ""TITLE"" labels in hard plastic on either side of the ball, they have hard and sharp edges which cut my fists if I work on it without gloves. I cut them off.Its only got an elastic band on the bottom end, I have tried a similar speedball before with elastics in both ends, and I found that to be better. But it does the job, and can easily be modified on the mentioned parts."
3,Not Good Battery Fit for Charger,"Purchased so I didn't have to use and carry the cumbersome charger and cords that came with the camera to charge the battery. This one plugs directly into the outlet. However, the fit is not all that great and the battery tends to fall out on not seat correctly if you're not careful.If you're looking for a compact charger, this one does work if you're willing to overlook the fit. And it fits easily in my camera case without taking up too much space."
4,good intro to spanish literature,"I am currently reading this book for a Spanish class, and the novels are very entertaining. I found myself reading ahead just because the story was so compelling. Each is a story about a rite of passage, and the reading level is good for intermediate to advanced students. I have been studying Spanish for almost 8 years and had no difficulty with the language of the book. I highly recommend this for a quick, interesting read, possibly for brushing up on Spanish."
4,Always a winner.,"I love this product. It came on time and it was priced well enough to order it. If you do not use this product, you should."
5,A book with a great moral,This is the most adorable book ever which tells a version of the origin of groundhog day and teaches that a balance between hard work and play is very important. This has been a favourite of mine for my entire life.
1,Terrible!,"This was not at all what I was led to believe it was! And I am not permitted to return it, so I am stuck with it!"
4,listen to it on the regular,although its not as powerful as the ka1102 it's smaller size makes it easier for travel and for such a tiny radio the sound is amazing.
4,great for the whole family!,finally a video game that doesn't turn your kid into a couch potato! Great exercise for the whole family.
2,it was ok game i would not but that ever,it was ok game i really did not like all that much and i return it i would not buy that ever agin it waste time and money
3,Lacks depth...,"I'm a practicing engineer in Oregon. I have studied and reviewed concrete foundations for 5-6 years, and this book is lacking in quality depth - particularly with examples. If one wants to go into a graduate-level understanding of reinforced concrete design, this book will leave you disappointed due to the lack of example problems, clear and concise descriptions, and overall quality. James MacGregor's book is far more ""complete"". The plus for this book is that it at least attempts to cover retaining and foundation structures, but still lacks quality example problems to illustrate what is not too obvious within the ACI code. Quantity is a 5 star, quality is a 2 star, therefore I've given this a 3 star review."
2,Holds the scope...,The silver matte does not match the Taurus 44...yet Taurus makes this specifically for that gun. Why would the same manufacturer produce 2 completely separate metal mattes?!?If you know how to drill/tap...or know a good gunsmith...get the Weigand scope mount!
3,"Photos don't depict rich, vivid colors of '60s and '70s Pyrex","This guide has a lot of great information about the history of Pyrex, and the price guides have been invaluable when haggling with dealers at flea markets and antique malls over the price of a particular piece.However, I work in printing/publishing, and I was surprised that so many of the photos in the book are poorly lit or, worse, poorly toned. It makes it difficult to distinguish between prints and patterns, especially if you're a devotee of the Spring Blossom/Crazy Daisy pattern(s).My largest criticism of the book, however, is the organization. Most of the people I know who collect Pyrex do it by pattern-type, not piece-type. This is a much better resource if you're interested in collecting Pyrex in general, instead of all the pieces in a particular pattern."
5,Excellent Lenten guide,"I introduced this book to my parishioners as another source for walking the stations of the cross, with much delight and interest by them. They loved the descriptions that coordinated with the meditation, as well as the photos of the real, honest to goodness path of Jesus the Christ. I would highly recommend this for its appreciation of the authentic walk, the contributions of the women to Jesus' ministry, and the angst that we might feel as we reimagine Jesus' final walk to the cross and his resurrection. The photos are a unique feature that add much to this Lenten discipline and guide.I received a complimentary copy ofA Walk in Jerusalem: Stations of the Crossas a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit [...] to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
3,I can see this as a movie,"The book was well written, but the plot was slow moving for me. The reader knows more about what's going on than the main character. And besides the main character, I didn't feel for the characters. Didn't care who died. Kinda hard to finish, but I made it through."
2,Pages missing,"I almost liked the book until I found out that pages 17-32 are missing (but I've got a two-pack of pages 33-48 instead!).Sending the book back to amazon.com costs about as much as to buy it, so I just pass a word of warning.Otherwise, this book is quite practical and is good if you are a photographer already and are looking for details specific to the business.By no means is it a book to learn photography. And do you need it after all? As the authors put it, ""A photographer with mediocre talents and an incredible marketing and business structure can often become a success"". The illustrations in this book are the best proof to this statement."
1,The mikes were pointing the wrong way,"I don't like to say this, because I had really wanted the Nilsson version, but, on my DVD, the sound is dreadful. My ORITRON player is not exactly hi-fi, but I have re-checked with other disks and they are not too bad. Especially the voices (!! this IS opera), sound as if there were cushions over the microphones; or maybe they were placed in the lobby. Surely I am not the only one ??"
1,Deep sense of loss,"A historic record of the performance by Bohm, Nilsson and Vickers. However I felt so bad it was not captured well enough on tape to be enjoyed musically."
1,Detestable! Disgusting! I will throw up!,"This is the most absurd thing I've ever watched! The image is poor! The sound quality is horrendous! The scenery is ridiculous! The scenographer must be totally retarded! In my vocabulary, there aren't words enough horrible to define this monstrosity! One of Wagner's masterpieces has been profaned! I pity poor Karl Böhm for taking part in that aberration. The only star I've put is very kindness of my part (after all, it's the minimum rate). I feel nausea only thinking I spent my sweated money on that."
3,Good for baby under 3 months.,"I bought this carrier thinking it would be a good safe way to carry my newborn around the house. I used it maybe a handful of times and now it just sits in his closet. It's wonderful, snug, and warm for a newborn baby but just isn't durable enough for a baby over 3 months. The fabric stretches out leaving you uneasy about taking both hands off of your baby. I find the Snugli Vent Carrier much more useful and dependable. I use it everyday and my baby just loves it! It holds baby somewhat away from your body keeping you cool unlike The Baby Wrap which just gets way too warm!"
4,Great comfort but it is taking time for my little one to get used to,"I was really excited about the idea of having free hands while still keeping my baby close. It was semi difficult to get my 1 month old in a good position for the both of us to be completely comfortable but i think the bigger he gets and once he gets more head control, that will help make this baby wrap the ultimate."
5,tried them all-this is the best!,"I felt compelled to write because of the reviews I read before buying this wrap. I was almost turned off by the moms who said this was so difficult to put on. Well, don't let those comments deter you! I just bought it tonight and it took about 5 minutes to get on. I've had it for a couple of hours and my one month old baby has been nursing/sleeping in it the whole time. I'm a mother of 3, and like one of the other moms who wrote, I've tried every type of carrier. The others aren't bad, but this is by far the most comfortable and versatile. It's really great if you're nursing-much better than a traditional sling. It's also the only one that allows you to sit comfortably (like I'm doing now). TRUST ME, it is not hard to master. I can't imagine needing a video to figure it out. So glad I ignored the more negative comments. As far as wear and tear, I'd rather buy one of these every month than one of the $80 carriers."
2,Very hard to use.,I didn't really use this so it was a waste of money. It took too long to wrap it around the body and get it on just right. Would not recommed to anyone. It was comfy to wear though.
3,Decent product IF you need it,"Maybe my dissatisfaction with this item is that we ultimately had no use for it. It is one of those recommended items that seems like a good idea at the time, when you bring home that new baby. Ultimately, we never used it. Not once. It is awkward to don, and if you live in a warm climate, you'll be sweating buckets underneath. It just didn't seem to be that useful of an item. I find it just as easy to hold our baby. I'm not saying it's a bad product, but I don't think most moms (or dads like me) will find it very useful for very long."
1,Not Great,"This item is too complicated. I was so excited and bought this item. The cloth touches the floor when you use it, not hygenic. The sleep/nursing position, by the time your baby sleeps and you decide to move the baby to her crib, baby will wake up because to remove her from the wrap will wake her up. Too many cloth, too complicated"
1,Simple concept but does not work consistently,"Was excited to get this product initially. I liked the concept but very hard to get it right the first time. Needs multiple attempts and even then, does not secure the baby tight at times. Not good for new first time moms or for elderly who wants to use it for ease. I found this to be an expensive long piece of cloth.I also found it difficult to return this product back because Babies R Us store does nto carry them and therefore they refuse to take it back. I lost money on shipping and handling.I wish they develop this product in such a way that it needs minimum handling."
1,What a waste of $40,I absolutely hate this carrier! Baby does not feel secure in it at all. My baby is only 9 pounds and I can't even imagine trying to put a large baby in it. I tried to use it on several occasions and every time she began to slip further down my chest. I never trusted it and always had to hold onto it with one hand. I watched the instructional video and even had my husband try it out to make sure that I was putting it on correctly. Save your money and buy a better carrier!
1,Hated It!!!,I bought this product based on the reviews of other people and I hated it. I have a lower back problem and thought this would give me the support I needed with the least amount of shoulder pressure. I was never able to get the wrap to fit correctly and if you're lucky enough to get a video that isn't bouncing around so you can see how to put on the wrap congratulations to you (tried video on three VCR's). I attempted several times putting my daughter in the wrap and her head would lull around and she'd scream. I sent the product back and bought the $19.99 from a competitor and couldn't be happier.
4,good wrap,"this is a good wrap, but didn't use it as much as I thought I would. Comfortable to wear, but takes time to get on.didn't find easy to use with toddler age."
2,I never cared for Cindy much...,"I love Thoroughbred but I have to say that this is one of my least favorites. I agree with another review that said every horse Cindy rides and/or trains becomes a superhorse! And after Glory it's: Bye, bye! Thank you for playing. Now I'm going to go be with Storm. Then it's Champion etc. I stick with books about Ashleigh, Samantha and Christina because by what's written, I know that they really love their horses. But at least Cindy praises Champion after the Dubai World Cup. I recommend the Ashleigh series and all of the other books about Ashleigh, Christina and Samantha. But if you like Champion like I do, then you should read this book. It shows the Champion spirit that I like."
3,What in the heck?,"THis book was OK, but why would they let Cindy ride Champion in the race? Why don't they make her ride Limitless Time? Why did they let her ride at all? She should have to get used to riding lots of horses. She is also way too obsessed with riding and winning. Half of the time, she's not riding but she thinks that she's too busy anyway. She is way too weird! Why didn't Cindy and Max explain to each other so they wouldn't fight? And I don't believe that Cindy would win the Dubai World Cup for her third race on a horse she's never raced before."
3,Could have been much better,"The book was okay, but I agree with a lot of people. Cindy is now a spoiled brat. I think she could have been a lot less bratty in this book. I think Joanna Campbell will always be the best THOROUGHBRED author. And I know a lot of people agree with that."
3,Two bigots running amok in the windy city,"The authors of this dreadful book were a pair of journalists who wrote a series of similar books, all dreadful. On the one hand, historians may welcome various facts about old Chicago which one is not likely to find anywhere else. On the other hand, the book is absolutely rancid with every sort of bigotry imaginable. There was no category of humanity which the authors didn't despise. Such a book could never get published today."
3,What there is works well,"I bought this for nostalgia reasons and was surprised to find that it works just fine on 64-bit Windows 7, once I lowered it to 30 FPS (which is luckily an in-game option). There was some ancient adware attached, but avast removed it easily enough.The only problem is that instead of the ""37 great holes"" advertised on the CD case, there were only 18. The full four-course version of the game - called ""Miniverse Minigolf"" - doesn't seem to be available anywhere. It's still fun, though, and cheap enough."
1,A Team Season Two Faulty Disk,"I've only tried to watch one of the disks so far and it is a major disappointment. Of the four or so episodes on that disk, only one plays correctly. The other episodes freeze on the screen, the pixels and sound screw up, and the disk skips to the middle of the next episode. (Or sometimes it just starts itself over--where it again freezes on the screen and/or the pixels and sound mess up again).I'm very disappointed with the quality and based on this experience, cannot recommend this set."
3,A-TEAM,UNFORTUNATELY THE QUALITY OF THE COPYING PROCESS IS NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL. THE DVD FREEZES OFTEN AND AT LEASE ONE SHOW FREEZES AND WILL NOT PLAY TO THE END. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING FOR MY CHILDREN.
3,A Good Medici Primer,"A popular overview of the Medici dynasty. It's readable, and serves well as a starting point for learning about the Medicis.There is an index, but no bibliography, and the Notes section deals almost exclusively with buildings and artworks associated with the Medicis. The Medici entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is as complete as Hibbert's book, and I would recommend it as strongly as I would Hibbert."
1,"Boring, Boring",This is the most uninteresting book I have encountered. I gave up after the first 125 pages.
5,Discover Tai Chi for Beginners,"Like it because it was on film, making it personal for me! Learning, without going to a group, Tai Chi."
1,Dogs will eat,I have 2 9 month old chocolate labs and they both love to chew and eat this thing. I would watch your dogs with this chew toy as I bought one of the large ones and it is half gone and going into the garbage. My dogs haven't gotten sick but probably shouldn't be eating this either.
1,Made my dog sick!,"After receiving the product in the mail, I read the package that this bone is made of nylon and contrary to description, it is NOT edible.I left my 20 pound dog chew on it and after a few hours it was already scrapped and used-up. I usually leave her playing with the bone for an hour or so, and she began to feel really sick in the morning.Last night I let her play with the bone for a couple of hours during dinner, and this morning she threw up and was very sick. This bone made my dog sick, so it's going in the garbage and getting a bad review."
5,great chew toy for a pit bull,"we have a pit bull that destroys every chew toy we give her in less 24 hours. this bone actually lasts several weeks! and she loves it, keeps her entertained for hours!!"
1,"I wouldn't ever buy these again, stay away","I am a novice audiophile but I can tell these speakers leave a lot to be desired. My $40 radio shack speakers blow this thing away. The only difference between the Center channel and the towers is the mounting system and the orientation of the label on the grill. These are definitely not rated at RMS rating that they say that they are. I have mine hooked up to an onkyo 120 watt RMS reciever and they begin to pop and distort at about 1/3 volume. The Center and towers look pretty, but they don't perform like they should. If you want a better deal people are selling them on ebay for around 50 bucks, but I can't even say they are worth that."
3,High horsepower speaker...............,I was disappointed with the lack of clarity that you would connect to the name of Carver. This falls into the class of a high power center channel speaker. I have the wattage to push these past their entended use with power to spare. I recommend a change of brands that are proven performers.Polk audio or Infinity would be my recommendation. They are very responsive to low wattage applications and have excellent clarity throughout the upper power range.
3,Disappointing,"Heard one track on Pandora, and based on my past success with Windham Hill, ordered the whole album. I must say I was disappointed with the result. The Pandora song was the best on the album. I was looking for a guitar style closer to Will Ackerman, but what I heard was closer to Chet Atkins.So, unfortunately, this one was not up to the high standard set by my previous Windham Hill albums."
1,I DISAGRE COMPLETELY,"although i agree substancally, everything said abut this band is true- But the DVD-A, I got better sound on my other best of mountian cds. I Guess if theres some rare song here it might be worth it- otherwise just buy a used copy of one of thier best cds because as far as superiour sound- Theres nothing to hear here folks."
5,A must buy,I love F1 needless to say. This is a must have for every F1 fan. It is also a good record material. Captures all the important moments and facts.Exhilarating I must say.
3,Proraso,"I hate to rate a product low, but I'm just not so sure that this helped at all. Maybe a little bit but I didn't experience a night and day difference. Maybe because I didn't use it every day?Going back in time, I'd buy this product again, because there are many people on amazon who have rated it 5 stars. Just maybe it doesn't work for everyone.In response to a comment, I am adding the following update to share a little more information on my feelings after 2 years.I still have it, and use it from time to time. I don't see or feel any noticeable difference from using it, but I also don't see any noticeable differences from taking a multi-vitamin every day either. So there is a chance that there is some value add here that I just am not seeing which is why I use it from time to time. Just not for every shave."
4,Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave (3.4 oz.),This product gives your face a really good fresh feeling. I use it every time I shave and it helps prevent bumps form popping up.
4,Great stuff for your face after a shave,This is really quality stuff for your face after a shave - the smell is very nice - not over powering. It leaves your face feeling fresh and is very light not heavy.The bottle is very elegant too. Nicely shaped so it fits in the med cabinet without taking up too much room.
2,Not much for the price,"Fortunately I bought this book through a used dealer on Amazon, as it is not worth the original price. At the time it was written I'm sure it presented unique ideas, but today all of the information, such as making a brew kettle from a keg, and mash tun from a cooler, is available in other books, home brewing magazines, or free on the web. I sought it out and bought it out of curiosity because it was mentioned in another book. It is suitable as a historical reference."
1,Too Expensive,"This exact same set is sold for $3 at Wal-Mart. Even $3 is a lot, but $7 is a joke! Way too much to spend on 9 stickers!"
3,Decent,"It was a good book. It left a little description to be desired, but it was still a good read."
5,One video game to rule them all...,"The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers was a big seller last year. The Two Towers was one of the first GOOD movie adpation to video games. But like every video game it had some problems, such as no co-op, wheres Gandalf, Frodo and Sam; and of course the game needed the environments to be more interactive. Now, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King sequel will fix up all the patches from the first game. With playble characters like Sam, Frodo, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas and of course Aragorn will help you adventure though middle earth. Also, the game will feature 12 enviroments and secreat characters like Pippin, Mary, and Farimir. Last, the game will have such bosses like Sauron, the witch king and of course Shelob. So good luck, and may the battle for middle earth be a victory."
5,AWESOME GAME,This may be one of the best licensed games ever. To recreating the film and the nicely added cut scenes this game has it all. Yes it is a button masher but the difficulty is at just the right amount. I cant recommend this game enough!
4,Awesome!,"Hey, I'm a hard-core LOTR fan, so I guess i'm a little biased. Still, I've got to say, I love this game! Sure, the camera angles can get a little annoying and the game has little replaying value, but it's quite fun, while it lasts. It is also quite difficult. The Wall of Minas Tirith level really took me a while. Still, I enjoy playing this game. Back to limited replay value: this is a pretty repetitive game. To put it simply, it's all the same, kill kill kill. Orcs, Trolls, Ringwraiths, it's all fighting. Still, if you want a great game with nice graphics, plenty of action, and stunningly-rendered scenery, give this game a try!"
2,Overrated,"Grapics: 10/10, very goodPlot: 8/10 Directly from the movie; cheap, but what the heyDifficulty: 2/10 Okay, here is where I start to differ with other people. I am huge gamer, and I pride myself on the large variety of video games I have played. But this game's difficulty is just ridiculus for (what the manufacturers call) 'easy'. I played the section on Minas Tirith appx. 45 times, and MADE ABSOLUTELY NO HEADWAY. Perhaps I'm simply bad at this game, but I think some other fans will agree with me that this was not nearly difficult as Fellowship of the Ring or Two Towers.Overall: 4/10 Sorry, but what good are graphics/plot if you can't go three levels without dying???"
2,It's All Been Done Before,"I will admit, I am slightly biased, because nothing about The Lord of the Rings appeals to me. However, I played through the first two games, and found them ejoyable and stunningly rendered.Yet this third installment offers absolutely nothing new. If you have played ""Fellowship"" and ""Towers,"" you will know what this game is, what it will look like, and how it will play. Nothing has changed. The graphics are beautiful, but we have seen that in the last two. If something happens twice, it ceases to be amazing.I tried not to let my bias affect my view. I could not, however, enjoy playing the same game for the third time."
5,This game rocks!,"I love this game because it is just like the movie! You feel like you are in the game.If the orcs in the movie scare you don't buy this, but if you are ok with the movie this game is a must.The graphics are so good in this game that sometimes I think that it is a movie clip. You can be Gandolf, Frodo, Aragorn, and more!"
2,These do absolutely nothing.,"I was ordering some of the Sole Stoppers from Foot Petals and thought I'd try a pack of these too to see if they'd add some comfort to some heels that had lost their support. After receiving them and trying them out, I am kind of dumbfounded by the good reviews. These provided little to no comfort, and if anything, increased the discomfort in my shoe by being too thin and pushing my foot upward and forward, causing me to get blisters. Save your money.The Sole Stoppers are amazing though!"
3,Shiloh's Promise - Bj James,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERMR. NOVEMBERName: Shiloh ButlerPast: Vietnam. The lush, deadly jungle. The prison camp. The men--his men--who didn't survive.Present: Shiloh was determined to pay his debt to one of those men by protecting his widow.Future: He would save Meg and her children or die trying.When Shiloh stood beside the grave of his murdered war buddy, his heart went out to the grieving widow, Meg Sullivan. And when a crazed killer came after Meg and her children Shiloh used all his military skill to protect her. But Meg was as vulnerable as she was beautiful. Who would protect her from Shiloh?"
5,Excellent book that conveys the spirit of Sir Francis Bacon,"The most interesting book I have ever read on the life of Bacon. This book is for both the new student to Bacon, as well as more seasoned researchers. A must read for all people interested in the enlightenment and advancement of mankind. Come with an open mind!"
3,german techno at its best,"bronto beats comes from the german record label spv. its a two cd set which contains mainly techno and rave music. the cd has some great track like acid india, beyond, time modulator and a great remix of robin s' you gotta show me love. if you are into dance and techno and are just starting out this is definitely the cd to have."
4,"In one word, it is AWESOME!!","The recording is great, the band it tight and the crowd is really into it. I have had the cd for about 2 months and I listen to it every other day it seems. Paul R. is dynamic, his vocal range is where it was if not better than 20 yrs. ago. Some many classics and hit songs, BAD Company rocks till this day."
1,Real bad,"I was quite excited at the idea of finally having a Bad Co LIVE with Paul Rodgers...and then I heard it!Bad Company has always been a cool bluesy hard rock band, the power coming more from the soul and groove than from an expense of energy, therefor I wasn't expecting a blasting over-energetic Live album...but come on, on this album Bad Co sounds like a very very tired band ready to retire!Still, Paul Rodgers 's voice is magnificient but completely ruined by the interferences of the guitarist.Where did they get that guy?Doesn't he know how to tune up a guitar or how to make a solo?It really is AWFUL!Please listen before buying unless you are completely deaf."
2,"""...It's Only Recycled Past...""","whew...Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke playing together again. Instead of this regurgitated blather about ""Bucket,"" I just don't understand why those two didn't go ALL the way, sign up Andy Fraser for bass and Rabbit Bundrick for keyboards and just call the group ""Free Revisited"" or something? Fact is, it AIN'T ""Bad Company"" without Mick Ralphs and Boz Burrell"
1,Disappointing!!!,"First of all...we have the full length movie and my son ADORES it! He is 2 and mimics all of the characters:)Needless to say I was excited to see a new one out (even if it went straight to DVD) especially that it involved Halloween seemed perfect. I had no clue that it was only 20 min or so long. Before you can even start to get into it, it's over.Story (or lack thereof) is very basic and silly. What a waste. Cost me just as much as the regular movie too..."
5,"At last, the truth",This book is excellent and should be compulsory reading for all Americans interested in Ireland. It is a clear exposition of the traditions and religious beliefs of the Orangemen and demolishes much of the myths smeared at the LOI by anti-Protestant bigots. A very very good read and the authoress should be congratulated.
4,At last,For once a book that actually puts forward a view that most Orangemen and Protestants agreed with. Thye book is very balanced but unfortunatley Ruth Dudley Edwards wanders into a political debate rather than sticking to a cultural theme which is what the Loyal Orders are about.
4,Informative and useful,"Nina Hartley was a registered nurse at one time. As a result, her DVD lectures on various aspects of sex are informative while also being fun to watch. Her ones on making love to (men or women) were extraordinary, as she was in her late prime. For fans of hers, like me, it was great. In this and later disks, she is 'past her prime' and relies on other actors from the same company to fill in for her. She still pitches in, but the fantastic Nina is now a more mature and mundane actor."
1,Oh my Oh my,"This book came in terrible condition. There were rips in the pages, completely eliminating words from the book. I was so disappointed - someone should have had the good sense to know that it should never have been sold to someone else. Definitely not ""acceptable""."
5,A Dinosaur Favorite that We Read Again and Again,"I purchased this book for my daughter when she was only one, and we both quickly learned to love it. Then, when my son came along, this book became one of his favorites as well! The wonderful rhymes and adorable pictures make this book a true blessing for the parent who has to read it over, and over, and over... :-)I was especially impressed by the small bit of musical score that is part of the rhyme ""Dinosaurs singing a dinosaur song."" Whenever we get to that page, my children love to sing the little tune that is written there!Sandra Boynton is a wonderful children's writer, and this is a great example of her work. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Intoxicating,"My girlfriend and I went to Nordstrom's recently and the lady at the fragrance counter helped us go through twenty different scents. Some of the other stand-outs included Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker and Vera Wang's Sheer Veil. She wanted something spicy, and lavendery...Shanghai has undertones of Plum and really captures the aroma of it's namesake. She had been wearing Alfred Sung's Mei which smells kind of like White Linen by Estee Lauder and is a scent I really didn't care for but didn't have the heart to tell her. Women who don't want to smell like every one else but want a memorable and sexy smell should try this. I'm a male in my mid-twenties and I love it when my girlfriend wears this scent!"
5,Fred Hammond Fan,This album was anointed from beginning to end. Fred has done it again. Make it LOUD!!!
3,"Good, but not his best","I am a big Fred Hammond fan, and I enjoyed the cd, but it wasn't his best work. I miss him singing with radicals for christ. This album was nothing like what I expected. I'm not knocking my boi, but I hope that the next one is better."
3,5843AZ,"This vacuum has great suction, but is ugly! The colors are just too odd. I was happy the first time I used the vacuum, but the second time, the attachment for stairs stopped rotating and no longer works. The spin duster works in principal but the collar on the duster that locks it in gets in the way when you dust.Over all, I wish I had tried this vacuum in the store, I probably would not have purchased it."
5,Great fenders,"I've been using these fenders for about 3000 miles and have to stop and compliment the designer. They were easy to attach to my 1977 Austro Daimler commuter bike, and the stainless steel hardware looks as good as the day they were installed. I do ""bus&bike"" in the morning and rest the bus rack clamp right on the front fender. I no longer fear arriving at work with a muddy stripe up my rear end on days when there's unexpected rain. My shoes stay dryer and warmer with that monster mud flap. The narrow fenders I got for this road bike won't swallow the larger commuter tires I've considered, but they are ample for the 1"" and 1 1/8"" currently used. I feel this product allows me to take the bike on more days that might be wet, and any day that I don't drive is a great day."
4,Great Fenders,"These fenders are high quality, light, and come with great mounting parts. I mounted them on an 80's era steel univega road bike converted to a single speed and 700c wheels and they fit perfectly."
3,Retreads,"Nora Roberts copyrighted Suzanna's Surrender in 1991. The same with for the Love of Lilah. I would bet Megan's Mate was the same vintage. I thought Suzanna's Surrender was pretty good. Love of Lilah mediocre and found the Emeralds tiresome. If there is a mystery, I want it resoved, not dragged out over 4 or books.I am generally a Nora fan, but these weren't her best."
5,Acqua Della Macchia Mediterranea Borsari,"I've wanted this fragrance for 20 years or more. My elder Aunt wore this, I couldn't remember the name, until I was surfing fragrances on AMAZON .... et voila!okay.... this fragrance is sublime. Like a soft summers seabreeze, rolling over fragrant hills of lemon, thyme, verbena, olive trees ripening and offering their sweet delights... Originally purchased for my lovely wife, I wear this Borsari, as does our 21 year old son.I suppose you could say this really was a FRAGRANCE WORTH WAITNG FOR !, from Dear Aunt, handed down in her way, to our family in Canada !Thanks AuntieThanks GANPATI TRADINGThanks Amazon for helping to Bring This World TOGETHER !Sincerely V8"
3,"Jeesh, I'm Bleeping Radiant!","I liked the Daily Illuminating Face Lotion enough to buy a full sized bottle. The Quench Body Lotion, however, has that nasty self-tanner fragrance (is anybody out thare in the cosmetics world paying attention? This stuff smells B-A-D!) The bonus eye pillow is silly, but has a nice lavendar fragrance. It's just a rectangle with a satiny fabric on one side and a flannel on the other, and tends to slip right off my face."
3,im not sure about this book,"generally i like beverly barton but she could do with less of the gratouitous sex and more of the suspense. I will admit i enjoyed it but i doubt it will ever win the nobel prize. however, i shouldnt really say that about beverly barton, she's a brave and regular author whereas i couldnt write a book to save my life.good for her."
4,UnNerving,"The problem with most suspense novels, I usually have the 'WHO DONE IT' figured out before I'm even half-way through the book. Not so with this one. Keeping the road to discovery chilling, suspenseful and exciting, Ms. Barton was very clever in keeping the culprit, behind the mysterious deaths of all those unfortunate redheads, under wraps, until exposing an idenity that is sure to draw a gasp from the reader.Combine that with the sexual tension she fuels between Reve Sorrell's and Mr. Jacob Butler and what you have with, 'As Good As Dead' is a very powerful, nail-biting, intense read."
3,Basic Tatting Info by Aunt Ellen,"When the Worksbasket published ""Aunt Ellen's Tatting Handbook: A Treasury of Techniques and Projects"" it contained the basic tatting info with classic type patterns. It is still a good tool for the beginner. However, there must be a typographical error in the price listed ($299.99) as the booklet is still available on the second hand market today at around $5."
2,Wow......Did that suck!!!!,This made for TV shlock was about as entertaining as watching flies procreate!!!
4,Worth The Price,"I just bought my copy of this DVD the other day and have had no problems with the sound. I was hesitant to purchase it due to the bad sound reviews, but it sounds just fine on my surround sound system. I am disappointed that some of the songs were cut short, but if you only like ABBA then you'll regret not buying this while it is available, especially at this price. I'm sure it won't be too long before it is sought after on e-bay at greatly inflated auction prices."
3,Steve B's review,Expected them to play more of their hits.The video spent more time on behind the scenes footage than the actual concert itself.It was also to short.The greatest hits DVD is much better.
3,Satisfied,"I like he sign, it adds humor to my home bar. My friends love it and is thinking of purchasing it."
3,Rusted,This sign had rust on the corners and back of it when I received it. Since I'm lazy I decided to not mess with exchanges and hung it up anyways.
2,I've seen better for much less money,I'd save your money and get something else. The Hydrostatic is a marketing scheme to me and doesn't do much in practice. The one I got had oil coming out of the bottom and it would not pan smoothly at all. I bought a 40 dollar gorilla pod head that works twice as good and holds the weight better!
4,this is great metal!,"Ahh, about time we had a real Metal album from an older metal group. With disappointments from Queensryche and Two,its about time someone released an album of true a**-kicking Metal. This album probably has the two greatest Priest songs recorded,""Death Row"" and the all-mighty ""Cathredral Spires"". The rest of the album has some truly defining moments as well. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens has a much greater range than Halford, hitting both Death Metal growls and angel-like harmonies, usually in the same song. Now, I will shut up and let you buy this great slab of Metal."
2,Disappointing,"I really could have lived without this. Priest, the heavy metal pioneer for so many years, has sold out and become a me-too speed/death metal band. There are bright spots on Jugulator, such as ""Death Row"" and ""Burn in Hell,"" but the rest of it bears no resemblance to the Priest we know and love. Yes, Ripper is awesome, and has breathed new life into the band, but the SONGS! Comparing this crap to ""Victim of Changes"" or ""The Sentinel"" is a joke. Also, Tipton and Downing's talents are hidden in a wall of noise.My recommedation: Buy the live Meltdown album instead, and go see them in concert. The live album has the best of new and old (Ripper's performance of the old stuff is awe-inspiring) and the show is still the best concert I have ever seen."
5,win one for the ripper,"This is the only Priest record I have. It doesn't sound like anything they put out in the past. I've had this since it came out back in '97 and I still love it. From Jugulator to Bullet Train these guys just try to pound a dent into your head. I understand that fans of the old Priest won't like this. However, if you want just some good metal. Then you should check this out."
1,This is a joke...right?,"The production, look and vocals on this CD all seem right...the hodge podged songs feauring 1/2 grand ideas and 1/2 schlock are not. The whole thing seems lacking in any organization and the lyrics are enough to send the entire world away from them in their stupidity. I mean...the lyrics are AWFUL. The riffs are sludgy, often good - but often not so good. It's just a mixed bag I can only suggest to those who like clusterbomb releases - though catch the two classics ""Bullet Train"" and ""Cathedral Spires"" at the end - this should have just been a single with those two songs in all reality.Releases like this might kill metal one day..."
1,MAYBE THE BEST WORK BY PRIEST???? ARE YOU KIDDING?,"To say that this is maybe the best work by Priest may only mean a big joke... ""JUNKULATOR"" is a piece of junk. PRIEST drawn a new logo, why they do have this new found need to look ""aggressive"", ""violent""? And what about the song titles? ""BURN IN HELL""???? Come on, guys, you are better than this !!! Ok, I admit you have to change a little to go on with the times, but to copy these nineties garbages that are around was something I never iamgined Priest to do. I watched them in concert some months ago, and thankfully they just played two songs from this terrible album and just two more from the even worse DEMOLITION. (therefore robbing us of four more good old-days tunes !!!!). Alive, they are still energetic and perfect. Ripper Owens has nothing to prove, his voice is amazing and he sings Halford's tunes with respect and personality. But this ""new"" Priest with the ""new"" logo and ""new"" record company should bear another name..."
2,Judas who?,"I've listened to priest since '74 and this is definately not JP. If you like hard thrash metal.. (I do by the way) this is a good Collection. However, for those of you looking for a Priest Revival..Continue looking..Owens does a good job as frontman, the riffs are perfectly executed, it's hard and heavy, but not JP. I think I'll keep it for posterity, but probably won't be playing it much...METALHEAD>>>>>>>"
2,UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING WENT WRONG,"JUDAS came back after 7 years. The new singer is amazing: he can sing like Halford when he wants, he can be himself when he wants, he has total voice control. Guitarrist Glenn TIpton assumed control of all lyrics, and they are good too. The trouble is: the songs just aren't good enough. The only exception is ""Cathedral Expires"", which I consider a classic."
1,"Great Movie, Poor Quality","Got this video through Amazon auction source, but quality was the worst I've ever seen. The actors' heads were all cut off if you could even make out the scenes, since the contrast or brightness was very dark! Looked as if the auctioner video taped the film at a movie house. Absolutely the worst! Don't use the auctioner that sold me this piece of junk."
1,Duke Boot,I really can't review this item because I found the sizes (EEE) much too narrow. would have to say the general overall sizing is too skimpy.
1,"Too much preaching, a shame to waste good characters","I'd read the original kathy Tyers Firebird book but this new, altered series is a real let down. I'd rather read Cherryh, Doyle & McDonald, Lee and Miller's Liaden stuff than get preached to like this."
3,Not happy,"I tried to return this because it turned colors. I was very disappointed that they chose not to help me. I wanted to order one for my classmate but after this experience, I'll be looking for it from somewhere else."
5,I like this boot brush a lot.,I bought it without the metal base for it and screwed it directly to the deck outside my door.I love it. I usually use a swinging motion with my foot to 'kick' my shoe through the brush forwards and backwards.The brush cleans my boots quite well. I liked it so much that I bought a couple more for relatives.Good for snow and dirt.Enjoy.
5,Excellent,I needed a smaller lens for my camera and this was exactly what I needed and does a excellent job
4,So far so good,"While not spectacular, if you're looking for a starter lens this seems to be the best way to go. Works very well with my Nikon d80. My only complaint is that it looks and feels somewhat cheap; when zooming, the lens reaches out unlike other models of lenses where the lens stays contained in the lense container. Multiple times I've had the lense not retract all the way, too."
4,"Degus Love It, but has a lot of dust/""crumbs"" to it","The Degus (Baby Chinchillas) love it. Just your basic Tim Hay in a nice, convenient size, and the price was great ~$4. Local mall pet store was selling this same one for $6.99. But the 2 bales I got seemed to have a lot of dust or ""crumbs"" in the bag which obviously is of no use."
3,The Rabbit Says ... Yummy,A fair price - bunny really liked it. Tim hay and alfalfa are her favorites.
2,My guinea pig isn't a fan.,"Maybe I have a picky guinea pig, but he mostly enjoys the softer parts of the hay, which this brand seems to have very little of. Once they are finished, my guinea pig doesn't really seem interested."
2,Not the best hay..,This is not the best hay for your pet. Its coarse and yellow and far from fresh. my guinea pigs only really eat the parts of the hay that kind of look like flowers or wheat or something. I bought it because I ran short and had to get something cheap and fast. Its only good to hold your pets over until you can get something better.
2,Too tough,"The hay is all stems and very tough and course. For hay, you always want it to be soft, fragrant, and fresh. This hay is none of those things.Tough hay is less nutritious than good quality hay. The stems can also cut or irritate your pet's mouth.I used this hay for a while, but then switched to Oxbow and found that it was much better. My guinea pig ate more hay (GPs need unlimited grass hay) and he simply loved it.So don't waste your money on this, switch to a better brand."
3,A fairly good comeback.,"Pat's 10th studio release ""Innamorata"" #171, is one of best recordings in 10 years. This is a more organic sounding album than any of Pat's previous releases. On this album I enjoyed ""Only You Can Rock Me"", ""Strawberry Wine"", a song I heard a lot back in '97. Also liked ""At This Time"" and ""Dirty Little Secrets"". Pat would release ""Go"" in 2003."
4,An excellent technical referance,"This book laid out clear, concise, technical information needed to engineer an industrial dust/fume collection system from the ground up. Anyone with a technical background can quickly come up to speed and create high performance ventilation system with this single source. The only negative feature (which kept me from giving the book 5 stars) is additional examples would of been of greater help for someone with limited experience in vent designs."
5,Still going strong,"If Slaughter is one of those bands allegedly responsible for the death of rock n'roll then this album only proves that the band itself is alive and well. Unlinke many other similar groups who had come and go during the span of Slaughter's existence, these guys have stayed together, never straying away from the melodic hard rock sound that has become their trademark. On Revolution, their best album to date in my opinion, they have shown maturity and creativity that might have been not so evident in their previous efforts. From the edgy rocker American Pie to melodic power ballad Heat of the Moment, and the furious I'm Gone this album creates a vibe that stays with you long after you stop listening. This is by far the most memorable and melodic album Slaughter have released, and I'm a little disappointed that their newest effort Back To Reality does not continue into that direction."
3,not quite there,"This album sounds kind of like a 'trying to live in the 80's'album. There are some good songs on here'HEAVEN IT CRIES', TONGUE AND GROOVE' 'IM GONE'It just seems like a compilation of songs from past albums. Slaughter has never caught the true essence of their live show on a album. They are very energetic and tey get you caught up in what the are doing. Its too bad that they didn't do an album like that while Tim wasstill with us."
4,How to live in hard places,"In his unusually thorough, non specialist, treatment of anaerobicextremeophiles (non-oxygen using bacteria that live in weird places), the author answers some interesting questions, such as what kind of biologic adaptions does it take to live in places like boiling water or acid lakes? How do you collect samples of them? How do you culture creatures that die in the presense of oxygen? Is it possible that there's an entire biosphere far below ground?Oddly, the one explanation he leaves out why the archea are generally only found today in hostile places."
4,Great book!,"I really enjoyed this book and the prescence of so many characters. I liked this book because it deviated from the normal ""good guy / bad guy"" theme. This book was more like real life. The author showed the faults and strong points of all of the characters. It was easy reading but well written."
1,No friend of mine,I have very rarely given this bad of a review. I normally give at least 3 stars just for writing. I was shocked ms. Delinsky put this dribble out. She has written some fine books this is not one. The use of the F word and sex was just gross. The fact that a best friend could have sex with her best friends husband and by the end they are all friends again. Then the story goes on that the injured wife can understand why the husband had sex with her friend and neighbor. Come on what world does that happen in? I finished this book because it was on CD and I had a long drive otherwise I would have thrown it across the room. Why anyone gave this book 5 stars is beyond me. If you want to read trash this is perfect.
5,How can you go wrong?,"You really cannot go wrong with any books by Barbara Delinsky. I am hooked by page two in every book that I have read. I really feel like I am in the lives of her characters, and actually get disappointed when the books are over. This book is just one more example of how tragedy and every day lives can be transformed by those around us. Although we move in and out of relationships, there are always people that stay with us, whether we know it or not. Great read!"
4,nostalgic,"I loved the old Robin Hood show back in the day.... And when I found out who did it, I had to grab it. So, I really like one or two tracks on it and the rest is fine, just not as attractive to me. By fine I mean very well done and well themed, but I bought it for two tracks."
2,Hoblit keeps the proceedings hobbling along,"Based on the John Katzenbach novel, for a while HART'S WAR feels like an extended R-rated episode of HOGAN'S HEROES minus the laughs.Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis)fights for the civil rights of his men in a POW camp.- as if the Nazis cared about people's rights. He soon concocts a plan to hold a court martial to distract the Nazis while he and Lt. Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell) escape and destroy a German weapons plant.Directed by Gregory Hoblit, who made PRIMAL FEAR and FALLEN, HART'S WAR is technically well made, but doesn't evoke fond memories of THE GREAT ESCAPE or VON RYAN'S EXPRESS, though admittedly there are a few good explosions here and there. Pity the rest of the movie wasn't explosive."
2,What happened to the book?,"I read the novel and was thoroughly exited about the prospect of seeing it turned into a movie. How dissapointed I was. What was a harrowing tale about racism and a legal battle fought in a a trumped up court martial turned into another Bruce Willis action flic, and not a good one at that. The movie was not true to the book and while this happens a lot in movies (see Enemy at the Gates, nee War of the Rats)in this case it did not improve the story at all and in fact reduced the real story line so much that it was relegated to a delivery device for Bruce's glares and command prescence."
4,To Have & Have Not,"Hart's War is an interesting study in priviledge and deprivation. Colin Farrell who starred as Jesse James in ""American Outlaws"" does a good job of playing the Senator's son with the cushy wartime job who gets captured, tortured, capitulates, and must prove himself in the war camp not for who he knows but who he is. Terrence Dashon Howard does a great job as the accused black aviator; and the film explores these issues of rascism in WWII. Bruce Willis turns in a journeyman performance as Col. William McNamara. While this may not be a classic drama, it does keep a good pace and keeps you involved with the story to the end. The DVD version didn't have any deleted scenes and seemed a bit light except for some added trailers for other films. All in all, a good time."
4,good flick,"Hart's War is an entertaining movie. It's more or less a remake of The Great Escape (1963), but instead of the comic Escape (a la Hogan's Heroes), Hart's War takes on a more serious, dramatic element (which isn't to belittle the Nazi POW comedy, I personally liked Great Escape more). There are well done performances by Willis and Farrell--very low key--but the truly great performance in this film is Marcel Iures as the Nazi camp commandant. He manages to keep from being a cliche and humanizing what would normally be portrayed as a 'monster.' You even find yourself liking the man. The ending is a bit melodramatic, from the surprise confession to the final scene, but not so much that it completely detracts from the rest of the film It's a well made, well writeen, thouroughly enjoyable film."
4,"Interesting Film, but not what I expected...","This was a good film if you have an idea of what it is about before you start.Overall, it is a little depressing. A good story that needs to be told, but don't watch it if you don't want to be depressed. Bruce Willis is not the real star of the film. He is only in it for small pieces. His character is a powerful force for the plot.It is mainly a story of racial problems in a POW camp. There is also an underlying problem between the German commander and the leader of the POWs (Willis). This problem is never explained. A side story to the film is an escape attempt and a local factory that is making munitions.Definitely worth watching. Not a chick flick."
1,Hart's War-Playing the Race Card,"A feeble attempt byf the libral left to equate the WW2 generation's attitude towards blacks to the Nazi's murderous attitude towards the jews. The American POWs treat their fellow black POW airmen worse then the Nazis do . A complete playing of the race card in this movie, I was waiting for OJ to appear in a Tusk a gee Airmans uniform so the white folks could frame him. This was not even a war movie as it was advertised, it was a soap opera of a black hating cracker picking on to black airmen in a POW camp-American against American. The bad white cracker being the embodiment of evil, worse than the Nazi scum . The movie trailers said this was a great war movie, it was a sham and it is a disgrace to any vet of ww2 especially after 911. [shame on] Bruce Willis for taking a role in a movie of this nature. It is anti white, anti black and anti Ameican. A disgrace."
2,A civil rights movie in P.O.W. clothing,"This movie is reasonably well acted but the material is not what you are expecting. Bottom-line: there is VERY little action in Hart's War. Instead, there is a kangaroo court staged in the midst of a Nazi POW camp with a honorable black defendant and lots of white racists. Yawn. How many creative ways are left to show that White men are evil and Black men are oppressed? I'm white and this movie felt like a sucker punch. Rent it - don't buy it."
4,Surprisingly good..,"I'll admit it; I thought this movie looked terrible when I saw the trailers and had completely forgotten its existance until I saw it cheap on Blockbuster's previously viewed wall one day.. On a whim, I picked it up...All in all, this was a strong movie with great performances by the lead characters. Terrence Howard gives an excellent performance as one of the famous Tuskegee airmen; I hope we will be seeing a lot more of him on the big screen. My only criticism of the movie was that the end felt a little contrived and seemed to go against the grain of Bruce Willis' character; however, that conflict may in fact be the point..."
5,Engrossing WWII story,"Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell turn in outstanding performances as a U.S. colonel and lieutenant who have been captured and are in a German stalag. When two black Tuskegee airmen are captured, Willis assigns Farrell to protect them from some of the redneck enlisted men. Tempers flare and soon one of the newcomers is ..., and it becomes difficult to tell who the good guys are. This is an engrossing film with an oft-twisting plot which demonstrates the real meaning of honor and self-sacrifice."
3,Good procesal drama,Lt Hart(Farell) is a Us Officer serving in Europe in the WW2.After being captured by the nazis he is held captive in a Pow camp full of american pows willing to escape.There he met Col. Mcnamara(Willis) a tough officer which leds him to be a defense counselor of a black liuteniaunt aviator who is charged a murder of a white staff sergeant after this guy framed another black aviator to have counceled weapons in the camp.During the trial a plot is discovered underground pows are making a tunnel to get to the strategic points an put explosives which makes confussion and will led the inmates to escape from the camp.Intense and good with nice actions seciencies and a good finale.
2,17 months old does work anymore,"Bought on January 28, 2004 it worked well heated well BUT NOW June 28, 2005 doesnt work anymore. I'm now looking for the warranty. Hopefully its not over $50.00 down the drain. IT SHOULD HAVE WORKED FOR AT LEAST 4-5 years."
3,Read before you buy...,"This is a good quality memory reader, but you should know it won't fit a standard size SD memory card. I got it hoping it would work for my SD card from my camera and found that it only fits the mini SD cards. The slot opening is not large enough to fit a standard size SD card!"
5,Powerfully accurate,Absolutely on target. It is a relief to know that someone else understands the heartbreaking confusion of parenting a child with a mental illness. Highly recommended.
5,best changing pad ever!,"This keeps my baby from bumping his head on the changing table. It keeps him put a lot better then the others. And I like that it is flat instead of curved. The bottom had a non slip grip. And you can scew it in to your changing table, how smart. This company Basic Comfort also makes quality changing pad covers as well."
2,Right choice for amateurs!,"This book doesnt have the following information: How to feed a coral, how often and what to feed, what type of lightning to use and how many watts to use, what additives to add to the water and in what quantity. The book is very poor in pictures content, the pictures are all blurry and the colors are all faded out, doesnt have any info on how to treat a sick or infected coral. The levels of difficulty of each coral are not very well presented and identified, the author identifies each with a color, and the trouble is the colors are very poor in quality and are all faded, a yellow is almost like an orange which is very similar to a red, and its confusing sometimes.In sum its a book for a beginer but not for the advance aquarist. If you are on a middle or higher level do not buy it."
2,Ok as a second or third reference,"If I had to do it over again I would have really listened to the first review on amazon! This is an ok second or third source. It does very little for the reefer that need to get specific information (feeding habbits, placement, hardiness, etc.)It gives a general classification for all items (Green-begginer, Yellow-Intermediate, Red-advanced)It does provide est. lighting requirements( i.e. moderate lighting, or heavy lighting, or 10-12 hours of intense light)It also provides the common name and scientific names.Overall I'd give this a 2 out of 5"
5,"A nice little ""real"" movie","While not a ""Politcally correct"" film, this movie is fun and the characters are real. Go hang around any club and you'll find ""them"". It's a slice of urban Gen X that rings true. Kimberly Williams and Jessica Lundy are great, Jonathan Silverman and buds are funny and portray guys just like the ones I know."
1,"This is not the correct item ASIN: B00068NVMK it is supposed to have the book ,The Twilight Zone Companion and it does NOT. :(","This set is suppsoed to come with the softcover book, The Twilight Zone companion and it does NOT.I am usually very happy with my purchases from Amazon and the customer service is the BEST! :), but this is a BIG MISTAKE Amazon! Why are you selling the WRONG item? I ordered this a FEW times and EVERY time there is NO BOOK!"
2,No Subtitles or CC,"While I believe that I would have really liked Topper, I have a hearing problem and depend heavily on Subtitles or Closed Caption. Since this DVD has neither, I really didn't hear a lot of the dialog. The price was good, but I missed too much without the subtitles."
3,kept waiting for Leo G.,"never knew the TV series was based on this film and found Leo G. missing terribly...BUT this is as funny and entertaining... abs loved the Pierce Arrow (?) tank they drove with Cary's shoes and high speeds on winding country roads and the hilarity that ensues from the ghostly invasions that I think Topper secretly enjoys... Billi Burke is not annoying enough to merit Toppers deathwish but back then any squabble was deemed as horrific henpecking I spose... well, just trying to appreciate the older films here, perhaps I missed many nuances but enjoyed this best I could... TV Topper was my fav as a kid!"
2,Poor Video,I enjoy the older movies... Both Topper and Topper return has been on TV during the past year. The quality of this video nothing does not compare to what I saw on TV. The copy I purchased showed to much grain. If the DVR I was using had not broken down I would have recorded it from the TV. 4 March 2011
2,A poor transfer of a great film (and its so-so sequel),"The divergence of opinion on the quality of this disc is remarkable. Well, here's my two cents' worth: this is a poor quality transfer, hardly distinguishable from a VHS rental tape. I agree with those who say that this DVD must have been mastered from a tape of poor quality, and the heavy compression required to fit two movies on a single-layer DVD has hurt the image quality even more.Lack of detail, poor contrast, and jitter in the outer portions of the image are among the many visible flaws that detract from enjoying this disc. That's a crime, given how superbly funny ""Topper"" is. Unfortunately, unless and until somebody like Criterion does a fully restored release, this shoddy edition is the only game in town."
5,WONDERFUL!!,Watched this movie in college and could never think of the name for it. Found it on amazon and bought it. Wonderful old movie that i thoroughly enjoy!! Thank YoU!
2,"Kid-friendly, bores adults","After months of Nickelodeon's build up of this movie, I thought it would be better. The first half an hour is pretty entertaining and cute. But once all the kids build spaceships and go off into space to battle English-speaking, very smart aliens, I found it hard to pay attention..."
1,My DVD Player threw-up!,This movie gives nickeldodeon a bad name. It is booring and pointless and absolutley stupid.This is the worst movie i've ever seen - do i reccomend it NO! Is it a good kids movie for younger kids NO!Should anyone watch this dud NO!
5,"GREAT ""retro"" kids' movie!","I used my Prime membership to rent this movie for my classroom when they earned a popcorn party--I wanted something they hadn't seen, and this was made before they were born! :) They LOVED it--every single one of 'em! Highly engaging, lots of whoops and laughter from the kids!If you have never seen ""Santa vs. the Snowman,"" it's my favorite thing the same creator, Steve Oedekerk, has done! (I also show that every year to my classroom and they ask to see it over again just about every month...)You can't go wrong with this for first graders!"
2,I expected better....,"I'm sorry to say, but I expected better. I think this film was made poorly. I mean,it is so predictable. This movie is about Jimmy Neutron, a boy genius who invents things. One day, aliens come and take away the whole neighberhood'parents. The children first are happy, but then realize they have been taken by aliens. See this movie to find out what happens."
1,Uh... No...,"No. Just No. Half the time you watch Jimmy's big booty (don't wanna cuss) head taking half the picture up or being made fun of. Little children will be scared to death by his head. BUT IT'S NOT THAT ""FUNNY""!!!"
2,Jimmy Neutron,"This movie was just another over hyped computer animated kids film. I went in with high hopes but was soon faced with utter disapointment. The comedy quickly grew tired and the characters poor animation was sad. The main character looks like something you would see on the side of a Wendys Kids Meal bag. The rarely working invention concept has been seen time and time again. After watching movies such as Shrek and the Toy Story movies this movie is nothing but the desperate attempt of Nickelodeon to get into main stream computer animation. If you happen to have money that you have decided to burn and scatter into the wind I would recommend you spend it on this movie instead, otherwise stay away."
1,I found this movie rather silly and nasty than scary.,This is a rather stupid movie and is very un-life like. Huge flies might scare some but not me.
4,Brian Peck is the man!!!,"I watched this for the first time when I was about 12 and I thought wow how can anybod watch this with the scenes of the kentucky fried rat and the woman eating it,the dog in the microwave.These are gems of low budjet horror!Lets not forget you have Sean Astin,Clu Gulager,and James Karen.One fact about this movie is that is directed by Brian Peck,Who is that you ask,he is Scuz from return of the living dead where James Karen and Clu Gulager starred in.Oh the best story is the last story about a young boys obsession with flies.This dvd will satisfy your needs if you like low budget horror!"
1,No Excuse for this book,"This book was absolutely terrible. I had seen some Clancy movies and thought I would enjoy one of his books. Boy was I wrong. I'll never read another again. The characters were so one dimensional. The ""hero"" was, in my opinion, a cold-blooded killer who was as bad as the ""psychopaths"" he was out to get. He actually tortured one of the bad guys to death. It was also apparent that he couldn't be without a woman. During the six months between the time his beloved wife died and he met his new love, he ""visited"" hookers twice. He then fell in love (in a matter of hours) with a hitchhiker he picked up. Within a week after she was gone, he glommed on to the nurse who treated his wounds in the hospital. Everyone in the book was either all black or all white. I don't have one good thing to say about this book. Hard to believe this author actually made money from this junk."
3,It was Okay,"Not one of Clancy's best. It seemed to really get boring as the story went on, in fact I have not finished it. It just didnt keep my attention."
5,"The story of John Clark- ""Beware the fury of a patient man.""","In 'Without Remorse,' Tom Clancy tells us the background story of CIA legend Mr. Clark. Six months after the accidental death of his pregnant wife, John Kelly pulls over and picks up a young girl standing by the side of the road. Kelly falls in love with Pam as he helps nurse her back to help. Pam reveals that she was a teenage runaway that was made into a drug addict so that she would become a prostitute to make money for a group of drug dealers. Kelly wants to see who these people are and where they operate at, since he has friends on the police force in the city where Pam was a prostitute. As they are patrolling the neighborhood, they are spotted by the drug dealers. Kelly is shot and left for dead and Pam's body is found a few days later in a public park. Kelly decides to rid the city of the drug dealers his way - killing each of them with a different weapon so the police won't have a M.O. to go off of."
5,Without Remorse,Another great read from Clancy and it was great being able to have it available on my I Pad via the Kindle app.
5,Great Tom Clancy Backstory for Great Characters,"One of my favorites heroes, besides Jack Ryan, in Tom Clancy's books is John Clark. He is a dark figure with a mysterious past. He's a man admired for his action and his word. He works in black ops but has his own moral code. Clark is a man of action. This book essentially covers Clark's past. His girlfriend was murdered by Baltimore drug dealers who raped her while slowly asphyxiating her with a plastic bag. A horrific death that profoundly affects Clark. But he doesn't mope nor sit idly by. This ex-SEAL sets out upon a course of justice. He dispenses justice in the only way these murderous scum understand - by executing the drug dealers who peddle their death and addiction to adults and children. Clancy uses the story to give us greater backstory on Jack Ryan. His father, Emmet Ryan, is a detective trying to track down the killer of these drug dealers. But Clark keeps moving forward `Without Remorse'."
2,Mediocre Effort By The Master,"Tom Clancy has figured out that the John Clark character is the more interesting character to write about. But this isn't it. This revenge stuff is interesting, but this isn't anywhere near his best work. The part about Clark's girlfriend is dumb."
3,Just OK.....,"Without Remorse could have used less sub plots and a few hundred less pages to net the same result if not better. I found it hard to get through a lot of the book due to it's excess, a lot of it was boring filler. Unless reading books is your ""thing"" this is a lot of reading for the end result and I, in return for my time want better from a book this thick."
5,Without Remorse,"This book is a ""biography"" of one of Clancy's characters- Mr. Clark. The story explains that ""Mr. Clark"" was the result of intense internal torture- including love. Yet the book is not simply an outline of this man's life. It's a time machine going back to the Vietnam war. It describes how intense stress and mental torture will force a man to kill whomever he feels is pure trash(Ex: Pimp). Whether or not you're experienced at reading this type of material, WITHOUT REMORSE, is a good place to start. Of course, the main reason to read this book is the exploration of the psyche of Clancy's characters, and possibly, the psyche of Tom Clancy himself."
3,Half way to being good.,"This book has some excellent parts to it. I really enjoyed learning about Clark and his past. However, the main problem I had was all the build up to the POW mission resulting in a total let down. When I read Clancy I look for build ups to big action sequences. I understand that the big Special Forces raid that occurred in North Vietnam in the latter stages of the war was also a big failure, but this is supposed to be a fictional account of a different raid. I would much rather have seen it not go down at all, than have everyone get into place and just have Clark make a high-speed command decision and just call it all off. I just feel as though I paid attention to a lot of the build up only to feel like I wasted my time reading it"
5,A guy's love story!,"What happens when a special forces guy falls in love with a prostitute, who is captured and killed by pimp and his cronies? He takes action ""without remorse"". Excellent story. You can't put it down until you find out what happens. Great subplot of a rescue mission to 'nam."
2,"Great book, terrible Kindle conversion","This is a great book - I already own it on paperback, but wanted to transfer it to my Kindle for a re-read, since it's been years after I last read it. It's a shame then that I have to give this 2-stars, but I am reviewing the PRODUCT here, and that means reviewing what I paid for.I've never seen a Kindle book with as many typos/punctuation errors than this. The paperback is fine, but the conversion was really messed up. The errors are often enough to significantly detract from the reading experience. I knew this problem existed before purchasing, due to reading others' reviews, but I enjoyed the book so much that I had to have it in portable electronic form and there were no other options.Bottom line: avoid purchasing the Kindle version unless you really are prepared to ignore much-too-frequent typographical errors."
2,Total remorse,"This book was full of technical errors, misspellings and the multi-facet plot lines were very discombobulated and difficult to dicerne where one stopped and another began thru out the entire storyline. Very disappointing read.... Not what I expect of Tom Clancy."
4,Unique among Clancy novels,"This book is a departure from the formula of his previous works like Clear and Present Danger, and Patriot Games. It is a story of revenge taken by Clancy's CIA operative John Clark. We see how Clark came to be who he is in the Jack Ryan novels. This book was fantastic and it is recomended to all as are all of Clancy's novels."
4,"good, but not Clancy's best","Without Remorse was a very good book, but Clancy has done better. One thing that really annoyed me about this book was that the vietnam mission was aborted. Clancy is a genius at depicting battle scenes, which is shown in most of his other books. I spent the whole book looking foward to the huge vietnam battle, and then it gets called off at the last minute. The information leak does add something to the book, but the lack of a battle really hurts it. And in response to the last review, where it is stated ""Jack Ryan does not play a big part in this book..."" That is not entirely accurate because Jack Ryan is not even in the book. His father, Emmet, plays a part as a police officer who investigates John Clark's murders, but Jack is not in the book at all. Overall, this is a very good book, but it is not one of Clancy's best. If you want something better, try Rainbow Six or Clear and Present Danger."
4,'The origins of Mr Clark',"For those of you who follow the Tom Clancy's stories, 'Mr Clark' is included or mentioned in most of them. This story is darker than many of Tom Clancy's other stories but it explains how this shadowy and dangerous character evolved to what we encounter in later stories.John Kelly, is an ex navy seal and underwater demolitions expert whose wife and unborn baby are killed in an accident. A chance meeting with a young woman leads both to her torture and murder and his almost fatal shooting. John is then drawn into a dangerous world of drugs and prostitution trying to get revenge for his lover. Add to this the secret service wanting his help to save POW's in Vietnam and the Police investigation closing in on the 'invisible man' the dangers he faces just keep getting worse."
4,Good small TV,"We've had our model for a year, and for the price, it was an excellent value. My mother bought a 13 inch anolog off brand TV for about $10 more this December, and it lacked the features this Magnovox model has.Pros:Great picture for analogSmart Sound and PictureEasy to navigate menus and easy sleeper programingFront jacks for game consols/cameras and a headphone jackExcellent priceConsMono soundRather large footprint for the sizeOverall, this was a good purchase. Our apartment is small and at the moment, we don't need a large, expensive TV. This fit our needs well and really delivered quality for the price. Would be great for people who need a second TV in a bedroom/guest room, or for a college student or apartment dweller."
3,"The best Saxon effort since ""Power and the Glory""","Saxon really found his way back with this one, although the music is simply 80's metal, nothing new. But it has compact, intelligent and good songwriting."
3,Good... And bad...,"This is part 3 of the massave ""Trial of a Time Lord"". And it has its high points. Pip and Jane Baker have told this story well, and it moves along at a quick pace. It has low points, as well. Lack of physical description, lack of character, and just a feeling of... something missing, dynamo, semi-spoil the plot. Ah, well. Still very good. You'll also want to read ""The Mysterious Planet"", ""Mindwarp"", and ""The Ultimate Foe"", the other parts of ""Trial of a Time Lord""."
3,Good read when you want something fast,If you love when the boss and secretary get together you'll love this story. Lucy wishes her boss James Hancock would see her as more then just a secretary. Little does she know that James has been thinking of her a little more then usual. So Lucy decides to show up at a party dressed to the nine's with a guy friend. All of a sudden James is worried about losing his best assistant. Lucy is thrilled when James sweeps her into an intense affair. But soon passion leads to pregnancy. Will James leave her or will he stay and love her forever? I will have to agree with the person who said that the characters in the book are more in lust with each other then love but I still enjoyed the book.
4,snow treasure,"I liked this book because it has action, teamwork, friendship, history, and drama. This book is about when Peter Lundstorm, and the other kids Riswyk,Norway have to go get the town's gold before the Nazis find out about it. Will they get the gold, or will the Nazis get it. you have to read the book to find out."
1,I thought it was way to serious and i hated it!,Snow Treasure is the worst book i have ever read. It maybe good for parents but for my 4th grade class everyone agreed it was really boring. We were excited that it was over. If you like boring violent stories it would be the book to read. 29 out of 29 kids in my class hated it. I wouldnt recomand reading it!
5,Snow Treasure - A fantastic book! (Kid's Review),"In Snow Treasure, Nazis attacked Peter's village in Norway. Peter and his friends had a plan to stop the Nazis from getting their gold and getting more powerful. They had to ride on their sleds to the ocean with their country's gold which was nine million dollars in gold. They wanted to take the gold to America on their uncle's boat where it would be safe. It was a great risk. Peter was head of the defense club. All the kids that were old enough in the village went on the sled trips. On the way they passed many soldiers. Would they get caught? I like this book because it is a story of adventure and it is exciting. I thought they would get caught. I also like this book because it shows that kids can do big things. So read this book!by Alex MacAdam (Grade 3, SAS)"
4,A fun and exciting book,"Yes, fun and exciting is what this book is. It is not constant action,but it is definitly not a book for grandma to read!This book, in my words, does not require much thought. Meaning, all thoughtsare written out for you. I think this makes it better becauseyou can really sit back and enjoy the story, even while reading it!I read this book after a book that really gets your mind going,and I think that was a good choice. I think this becauseas I said before, this book is really fun, and a joy to read!-Katharine Manning, American School In Japan."
5,Perfect bone crushing metal!,"Except for ""Promise,"" the cheesy 80's soap opera ballad, all the songs are perfect bone crushing metal. Espiecially ""Half Past Dead."" Overkill's finest 45 minutes. I really like that classical ending to ""I'm Alright."" It really shows off the two guitarist's skill. Nome of the songs are very long. The longest is 6 minutes. When i first saw the picture of the band, it was kin've weird. The singer looks like he was in a cheesy boy band, the guitarist looks like a delivery boy, the other a biker. The bassist looks like Tony Iommi, and the drummer looks like a Indian. But together, they rock! Good music."
5,"Sexy, sultry secret that I'm going to share..","This perfume makes me feel sexy. Simply put. I was wary when heearing it described as a ""musk"" but my 25 yr old friend has been wearing it for 3 years now and it has become her signature scent. Everyone complimented her on how beautiful SHE smelled (not how beautiful the fragrance was on her) which gives one an idea of how beautifully this melts into the skin.I tried it myself and wow--I'm truly satisfied with this purchase. Not recommended for teens though--20s+ For I feel like a mature working woman when I wear this--and I am! How fitting ;)"
3,interesting take on goethe,"This piece is beautiful. Regardless of whether you're a fan of Romanticism, you will like this book, for it appeals to all perspectives and preferences. What is wonderful is that Goethe, (as Romantic as he was) was only defined during this period for his superficial criticism and defnition of the self in the traditionally romantic isolated fashion. He is however, as one reads him would come to know, highly an Enlightened thinker and realizes the inadequacy of Romanticism. You'll love this one."
3,Wolfgang's essay's and poetry in general,wolfgang is an interesting author. many of his poems and essays are about romance and love. if you like reading abstract poetry and getting into sweet and very interesting storites you will love Wolfgang!
5,ESTE LIBRO DE COCINA ES MUY ESPECIAL...,"porque aunque contiene las mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana auténtica, ES VEGETARIANO SI TU QUIERES Y SI NO QUIERES, NO.A las recetas puedes agragarles carne, jamón, pllo, pescado..¡lo que se te antoje !

5,The Ultimate Competitive Advantage,"The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is a book that every business could benefit from. It features companies who explored new areas to serve their customers and met the market demand head on. The author gives the business person a wellspring of ideas for faster productivity, more competitive prices and innovation as the by-word, with examples of specific companies, charting how their business grew. Paycheck from payroll to complete office management, down to bookstore reading lounge, coffee/snack bar.A good and profitable read."
2,Where were the new Cylons?,"Not enough of what I expected. Not near enough action. But a lot of mystery. Clearly this book could have gone a lot more than what it had. I don't recommend it at all. I am a big fan of Battlestar Galactia,but this book is a big let down. Will there be a seventh story from Richard Hatch? If so I hope everything comes to a head in it. Baltar is a hero in this story and that was the only good thing about it."
5,These pix of BSB are sooooo hot!,"As all people know the Backstreet Boys are so sexy! These pix show how cute their faces really are!! Every Bsb fan should own this book,or isn't a BSB fan at all."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"A Michael Connelly endorsement led me to this one.I simply either didn't get it or didn't like it...probably a combination of both.I found it too dark, depressing, bleak, unfun and almost hopeless. I love the LA crime novels of Michael Connelly, Raymond Chandler and Robert Crais, but this was ""too out there"" for me.Seeing all the five star reviews made me wonder if I was missing something. But, most of them are from California folks. So maybe it wasn't meant for me in the first place. Perhaps one needs to have the California experience to appreciate this. In any event this Florida reader didn't enjoy it."
2,I especially liked the part where the truck ran over everyone at the end,"I'm willing to move on from puzzle-type crime fiction, but I like at least some mystery, and there's none at all in this novel. The cult stuff in the first half is all pretty formulaic and not very relevant, even in 2000. And after Shannon exhausts his one-liners about cults and religion in general, he moves in the second half to a completely different problem, one to which there really is no solution, so he brings on the proverbial truck.I enjoyed The Concrete River, but Shannon must have switched editors or something. Everyone, including Shannon himself, spends time connecting him with Raymond Chandler, but a more apt comparison is with Carl Hiaasen. The difference is that Hiassen's kooky Floridians have something to do with the plot, whereas Shannon's kooks don't have any plot to connect to."
5,Good,"this cd was probably one of the best cds i've ever heard. This guy is good both in spanish and italian, i didn't really know who he was until i heard the cd las cosas que defendere (which is also good) even though i have the spanish copy i would still like to get the italian version because the songs lascia che io sia and notte bastarda sound excellent in their original version (even though they sound great in spanish too). in my opinion this cd is a must have."
3,Get the ITALIAN Version,"Amazon may not have the Italian version of this CD but I got lucky and found it in the North End, Boston. Italian specialty shops are a great place to look, and the woman was really excited when I bought the CD and knew who Nek was. It's a great CD so definitely buy it in Italian."
5,bird appliques,"Very nice applique patterns and instructions,color suggestions, and helpful tips. Many tiny pieces, so I recommend this for the skilled applique artist."
4,Cats for my sister,This is a terrific book for cat-lovers. I am making a wall-hanging for my Sis who has several cats. It will make a well-liked birthday gift.
1,"Small-size, not extra-size!!","The grill actually is a small-size GR20 series, not extra-size. I do not think it can serve family of 5 members. Let us think about it, 10~15 minutes just can do 2 pork or steak, how long it will take for 5 members? I do not like it."
2,I am a big Bill Murray-fan...,"...usually just a look at the guy makes me laugh. He has wonderful comic expressions! But there are limitations to the entertainment-qualities throughout this entire movie. And the ending not being much of an ending at all was a slap in the face spending 90 minutes of my life just waiting for it. The movie serves a question, no satisfying answer. To me.Murrays' previous ""hit"", that underwater-movie, was also horrible. Too easy, too simple. ""Lost in translation"" was beautiful. And proved a variety in Murrays' acting skills. Hoping for a more demanding part for him soon, it is easy to put a lot more into a movie that ""Broken flowers"" that in truth it deserves. Keep that in mind when you watch a movie that no matter what ""has got to be good. Why otherwise would Murray be in it?"""
3,Better and better,"For those that have the energy, time, inclination and required geek factor to read my review on Her Majesty's Amazon web site (i.e. www.amazon.co.uk), you will have read that I first found this film dull and uninspiring. Now that two days have past, I find I'm still thinking about the film. 'Shirley' that is the best litmus test (but Lost in Translation is better)."
1,Awful!!,This is a movie where you wait for something to happen and nothing ever does! What's worse is that the ending did not resolve the story. Bill Murray as a kind of loser who receives an unsigned note from an old girlfriend claiming that he is the father of her child. Murray seeks out 4 old girlfriends to find out who might have sent it. The director tries to be cute by having the daughter of one of the women (named Lolita of course) walk around naked in front of him. This was supposed to be the comedy in this film? This movie lacks any real humor and should be avoided at all costs.
1,It made me sleepy.,"Several years ago, when this film was released, I paid 35 bucks for a ticket to attend a live interview with Jim Jarmusch, the director of this film, at NYU with my buddy, Mike. It was two hours long, but it felt like six. Mr. Jarmusch stated that he wrote the script for this movie in two weeks. In my opinion, he took too long. It shouldn't have taken him longer than two days, three tops. It's as slow as a brontosaurus, boring as a Presbyterian, trite as a tube of toothpaste, and the story has nothing interesting to say about anything. And the film ends without the slightest resolution of its paper thin premise. It's like the movie ended because the director ran out of film. Mr. Jarmusch is a pretty interesting guy. But, let's face it, if Bill Murray wasn't in this film, you couldn't give it away."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen ...,"... both for Bill Murray and one in general. Slow, boring, pointless. 10 minutes of Bill Murray laying in his hotel room doing nothing. 15 minutes of Bill Murray driving in the car doing nothing. 20 minutes of Bill Murray sitting on his couch doing nothing. The rest is even more pointless and stupid, if that's at all possible. If you've seen ""Lost in Translation"", this is basically the same exact movie. (I would've said ""with a different plot"" if there was a plot, but there wasn't...)What a complete waste of time. I am starting to agree with my wife who keeps saying ""I hate Bill Murray"". I am starting to get there as well. One more movie like this, and I am done watching anything where he is one of the actors."
4,Broken Flowers = Good MOVIE,I don't reccomend this movie to everyone. My girlfriend even thought it was boring. I thought it was great and left me thinking after the movie was over and I want to know more about the story... that doesn't happen alot after I see a movie.If you are in the mood for a comedy do not watch this.If you are in the mood for a different type of movie that leaves you thinking after it is over and is simple to watch then give it a shot.If you like Bill Murray then I definetly reccomend it.
2,A nice pep talk,"If you want to know the structure of a purpose statement or research questions, or formats for a desertation, this is NOT the book for you. This is a pep talk on how swell it would be to write one, time management (which you should ALREADY be into) and cute and witty goody nice stuff. I was looking for examples and structure and theory. I can get all the time mgt stuff from my mentor. If you need a book to boost your morale, this could be the book for you. If you're looking for a book on the mechanics of writing a thesis this book is NOT for you. I wish I could get a refund. This book is that bad.It's NOT well written and if you are already into this, you'll find the writing style too soft and yucky, like a coffee shop discussion; nice and cute converations, but no real substance."
2,Not effective as a backpack,"While you might like this bag as a shoulder bag, the adjustable straps do not work well as a backpack."
4,A better lens carrying bag would be appreciated,"I have tried the lens in all of its focal lengths and it works well. Your eyes see photographs, not charts. Good composition, exposure (good eye for observation) will take you way farther than more expensive lenses (or cameras for that matter) ever will. My only complaint is the cheap carrying bag with NO padding at all. May fortune be with you should you drop it by accident. Otherwise go ahead a get the lens. You will like it."
2,"Low Quality, regardless pro or amateur....","Yes, the lens is sharp, but this is pretty much the only positive thing. Speed is okay and okay, you have to consider the price...After using this lens for a while, I realized that the pictures are simply less vivid. Comparing pictures from this lens with other lenses on the same camera (D80) shows a clear difference - the pictures look merely washed out and have less vivid colors. Despite all adjustments and testing, the pictures appear of much less quality if compared in a slide show...Okay, the price is great but who wants to have second class pictures...For me - unusable and not (absolutely not) worth the money.During the first few weeks of usage, I was actually satisfied. It took some time to find out that the difference is in the color quality. I then did a test and compared pictures by putting them together in a slide show.If you have this lens, try it out and make this test - you will be disappointed - drastic difference..."
3,"Great Lens, Slow AF","Good solid zoom lens. Important to note that the digital crop with the Nikon DX meter is 1.5, that means the lens is equivalent to a 82-300mm lens on a 35mm SLR. It is a slow lens so if you feel you will be shooting a lot in low light, go for the VR feature or invest in a tripod. The one downside is that the auto focus seems slow compared to my other lenses, but not slow enough to frustrated me or ruin a picture. If he AF is too slow switch to MF."
3,Not the sharpest lens,"You're not going to want to take a picture at anything slower than 1/60th of a second. Anything slower, this lens blurs.The picture quality is not great. I would say it's worse than the 18-55. Build quality is horrible. Very plasticky, feels very cheaply made."
3,Not quite what I had expected,"Bought it for the price which was a bad idea. It has a plastic lens mount, which I hate! The quality of the photo's is pretty good. I don't use it often in my wedding photography but it serves it's purpose for letting me zoom in close when I need to."
1,Disappointing Lens,"I got this lens in a kit with a Nikon D80 camera. This lens failed to deliver the goods 99% of the time. Why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this? Its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it. It was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length. A cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints. Very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm). I disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (D200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 VR lens from Nikon.If your interested in nice sharp pics, then pass on this lens. If you want to save a few bucks and like blurry photos, this lens is for you..."
5,Love the Lens!!,"For the money this is a great lens. Speedy focus, light weight, and very good picture quality. I am glad I bought this lens and not the much higher priced lens. For my purposes this lens does it all."
3,Without VR.. Challenging.,"Unless you are shooting in daytime outside.. Grabbing hand held steady photos with it when zoomed in is quite a challange.. plus, .. the difference in price with the VR version is silly.Would rather go for the VR version instead of this one.Buy this lens if:-- You are an amateur who loves taking photos of birds during daytime at the beach or wherever .. as long as there is sunlight. And, you don't want to spend a huge amount of money on photography gear.But I greatly recommend buying the VR version.Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom Nikkor Lens"
3,Cute but not worth the price,"This doll is cute, but it does not fulfill its advertising. It does not squeal. I finally got it to squeak after reading some customers reviews about sqeezing it like a dog toy. Then I finally got the febile squeek. My daughter cannot press hard enough to make it squeek. I like the look of it though, because it does not have really full lips like a lot of the ethnic dols, as my daughter has light brown skin & slim lips. It is made very durable, so you won't have to worry about it falling apart; it's no fun when the arms and legs start falling off your baby doll. I guess I just had higher expectations after reading about what it was supposed to be capable of doing; and usually if you pay more for a toy, you get a better toy. My daughter also has the baby born swimming baby doll, and for a price tag much less than this doll, it is a lot more fun. Well, at least Santa brought her a doll as she had requested in a letter to him."
2,k-ci my book,"this album is very late in the making. We the listening people, wanted this album when he was with jodeci!!! Before his voice went to this bobby womack transformation.You'll find about 3 songs you can listen to all the way through! Not the same k-ci that was with jodeci. I know how this sounds, this album needs better production! From the words, beats,and chorus. Like ronald isley, charlie wilson, needed, k-ci needs a good producer & songwriter to rejuvenate his career!! To name a few, R Kelly, Anthony Hamilton, Bryan Cox (from joe albums and many artists)and timbaland. These guys can write & produce soul for him, especially anthony hamilton!!! All in all the album is ok!"
5,Unbelievable,K-CI ....Brotha.....you done DONE IT!!!! I love the entire album.....I've listened to it over and over and over again....I can't get enough of K-CI's Powerhouse voice.....K-ci's vocal's are soulful as hell.....it goes straight to that point where IT LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE AND MORE.......THE ALBUM AINT NOTHIN NICE....... K-CI PUT ALOT INTO THIS PROJECT.....IT'S AN INSPIRATION
3,It's pretty good,"One thing I can say is he pretty much stays consistent with the prior K-Ci and Jojo albums, however I think he would have been a little better off if he would have had Jojo with him on this one as well. In this effort, some of the songs are just plain boring, but for the most part, it's an okay CD."
4,A combo printed in U.S.A.,"This record is great, we had to wait almost 10 years for geit it, but it's arrived to us.For all of us that are interested in technical descriptions, I just want to tell you that this item is printed in U.S.A. by Warner Music Latina, and the most important part............. is a double record (CD + DVD).Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Good show, bad DVD",Three episodes do not play correctly and when you look at the DVD itself you can see that they are poorly made with stains and de-lamination on edges and the center. Too bad because this is a fun show with great scenery and fun chemistry between the stars.
1,Good content - if it would play,"Good video, but one side of one DVD won't play at all. It's defective. And of course, I didn't discover it until after Amazon's warranty period was up (by two days). So now I'm stuck with a worthless DVD.Moral - check ALL tracks quickly before it's too late. They don't stand behind their defective products for very long."
1,BAD DVD QUALITY,The first DVD of the series does not work on the second side. It was not able to be viewed
4,Diablotek 1.44 Mb USB 2.0 floppy drive,Product was easily installed and works well on my HP Pavilion notebook running Windows Vista. I thought I was finished with floppies years ago until I pulled out my photo storage boxes and discovered several hundred floppy disks that contain hundreds of images from the early and mid-90's before digital images became commonplace. This USB drive gave me an easy to install workable option for recovering those images and storing them in a different format.
3,Does not work with Macs,"I gave this three stars because I really don't know how it works. I bought this for a mac ibook g4. The box does say mac, but the paperwork inside only says windows. It did not work with my ibook g4."
1,1/4 mile wide - 1 inch deep,If you know anything at all about XML and the semantic web - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. This book covers nothing in depth. I just spent 3 nights reading this book - waiting for something to happen - it never does. The author does not go into any decent technical detail on anything. If you have ever worked with XML and want to learn something about RDF etc... this is not the book for you.
3,Good music - bad engineering,"This album has some great songs on it. Unfortunately the engineering is not even.Simply - every song has an enormous overpowering bass drum right dead center. If you have a balanced system it is like an ""Eye of Sauron"" overpowering everything else on the album.Maybe a new release will come out with a more natural sound. Any good stage engineer would through a pillow in that thing."
4,metroid,"a very helpfull guide book .i am a die hard metroid fan, so when i got stumped i was shocked.thanks to the seller i got it from!"
1,Cooling Water-Frozen,"I had anticipated this DVD for days, being a great Lee Williams fan i couldn't wait to hear this man sing again..i was looking for at least an hour dvd but guess what..I paid extra to have this shipped to me ASAP, and what it turned out to be was a great disappointment, first the cooling water video, then a live performance in a room as large as a bathroom and finally doug and melvin williams singing an incredibly long song..so much for lee williams..15 dollars to see 2 songs..the customers should have been warned that there were only 3 songs on this dvd..a whole lot of wasted time and money...next time warn somone before hard earned money is invested in a disappointment"
3,good story,I enjoyed this book and its a very interesting story. I like dhis first book a little better though. (The Unwanted) its worth reading.
3,"Good, not Great","I have a love/hate relationship with this book. I really wanted to get it and use it, as well as have it on hand, but I don't fully trust it. It is exhaustive, has a veritable treasure trove of information in it, but it isn't that easy to use, and at times is a little confusing.Arranged by year and date, the battles, sieges, actions, and combats are arranged so that it is relatively easy to look up, but the information doesn't always agree with standard works on the period.For, example, Durenstein is listed as an allied victory in 1805, and elsewhere it is called a French one; Davout's victory over Bagration in 1812, a rather significant one, isn't even listed. Bottom line, in my opinion, there needs to be a revision, and soon.This book is recommended, and it is very useful; however, it is not the Holy Grail, and it is definitely not a definitive work."
2,Takes reader's stamina & determination,"After reading every word of the paperback, I find very little to say positive about ""The Winter War"". Knowing ""The Winter War"" won the 1961 Western Writers of America Spur Award in the HISTORICAL NOVEL division was probably my motive in selecting the book. It certainly took a lot of stamina and determination to get the book read."
4,She's a heavy...,"This thing is pretty heavy, putting it onto my carbon fiber tripod probably doubled the weight...The hydrostatic locks WORKS- you turn it 20-30 degrees and the ball isn't moving.The quick-release lock is a bit fiddly, but the quick-release plate can be clicked into place without having to use the lever, which is nice.The head is also a bit big. My Gitzo Traveller folds its legs upward and I can't completely close them but it's close."
3,"cute, but not what you expect","We got this to go with the hands and feet. In less than ten minutes the mask had ripped. The chest is hard and does not flex, making it uncomfortable to wear. And difficult to get off. My son rather likes the hands and feet, and now doesn't even wear the chest and face anymore. Save your money."
3,A good beach read but not his best work,"This book was good but not great. The Mars angle is very interesting and his science is terrific as always. His characterization and plotting were on the thin side. If you like Forward's other books you will like this one, although Dragon's Egg/Starquake and the Rocheworld series are more interesting in terms of both their science and plot/character development in my opinion. Maybe that's because the other books include alien races, which Forward seems to do better than human characters."
1,One time use only and then broke.,"We purchased this toy and thought it was great originally. Swam just like a real little fish and very cute. BUT, the battery compartment does NOT seal and it held water. We dried it completely after ruining the first battery, but it is completely unoperable now.....So, not worth it for a one-time use only. We also purchased the Dory and she broke, also."
2,Not What I Wanted,"I just started doing yoga about a month ago, and the VHS version of this workout is not what I was looking for. The instructor goes much too fast and there is no explanation of the poses. I couldn't get myself into the poses fast enough, and it wasn't at all the relaxing, stretching workout I was hoping for. I also found the instructor a little annoying. The words she used were too Earth Mothery and hippie dippie for me. I am a young, modern woman, and I just want to increase my flexibility, not align my energy flow/chi/chakras/whatever is the latest fad."
3,to the viewer from seattle,"To the reviewer from seattle, grow up! Reviews are written to help other people know if they would like that video or not. It is obvious that this video would be compared to Ms. Deason's previous video. I didn't find anyone crying in these reviews except the 'viewer from seattle'. Suzanne Deason is a wonderful yoga teacher, but I personally did not enjoy this video as much as her yoga conditioning for weight loss, which I see as continually challenging because you can always do yoga on a deeper level."
3,Nice backpack,My daughters liked it. It's a regular size backpack. My 3 years old likes to drag it around with her toys inside.
2,undatisfactory,"The book was missing several pages. If I would have known, I would have never bought it. I ended up just throwing it away because it wasn't even worth the hassle of sending it back for a refund."
3,It works I guess,"It works ok, but not like a standard petal hood. I really didn't see any major protection offered like petal hoods, but I guess it adds some.You really don't need it, but if you have to have one, it is ok."
5,Fire Sights,These do what They claim to do.They are great for Indoor and Outdoor Shooting.They were easy to install and I can highly recommend Them.
5,nice compact bag. note that product image is different from what you get,"i took a chance on purchasing this item after reading a review saying you can carry it over your shoulder as well. that's what i was looking for in a music stand bag. as you can see by the images i uploaded, it looks nothing like Amazon's product image.i didn't want to hold a music stand bag with my hand, but i wanted to carry it over my shoulder. this bag was the one! love it! looks good, compact, has shoulder strap, and carries my Musicians Gear music stand with some extra space at the top."
2,Nice Idea bad product,"I got these cups for my 15 mo old son. I thought that they would be great, a nice cup to take with us when we go out that I would not mind if we lost. I bought two packs and opened them right up, wash them, and then handed one to my son while he was sitting at the table. Not even two seconds later he had pulled the cap off and dumped the cup. This would be a great idea if the lids screwed on like the other sippy cups. The lids are really easy to take off. I would not recommend this cup to anyone unless you want a cup that your kids can open and you want to sit right next to them when ever they use this cup. Me I would just rather give him a regular cup he can not make any more of a mess. I love the other take and toss items and am really disappointed in this one."
3,"Not the ""Cat"" we usually yearn for.","This is not a bad album. This is just not the Cat Stevens most people are looking for. Musically fine, his voice is his alone, however it hasn't the feel of Tea for the Tillerman or many of the other works of this artist. Buying it is not a mistake, unless you search for the likes of ""Miles from Nowhere"", ""Moon Shadow"", ""Father & Son"", etc. It is likeable, but not the Cat Stevens you know the best."
3,ehh,"Most of the tracks on this one are kind of chilling/morbid/scary/don't-need-to-hear-it-I-can-watch-the-nightly-news. ""Boy With the Moon"" and Angelsea"" are good."
5,as good as ace of spades,"everyone is always ranting about ace of spades. i love that album but the new motorhead stuff can't be missed. this is pretty much the same classic motorhead sound. its actually a bit heavier but it still has the punk/metal motorhead sound. it appeals to a wide variety of listeners, if you like iron maiden, the ramones, or slayer you would probably like this. it is really good."
3,"Too much of some, not enough of other intformation","Let me start off by saying that chapter 1 is completely useless. I bought this book to learn about programming - not to learn tips and tricks for the OS! Chapter 1 has lessons on things like emptying the trash, getting file information, etc.! If I'm buying a book on programming, shouldn't it be assumed that I already know how TO MOVE AND COPY A FILE WITHIN THE OS??!!! Sorry, but it is useless in this book and SHOULD NOT be in there! A serious waste of space by the publishers.That said, the rest of the book is pretty good, but I wish it were more comprehensive (Hmmm, maybe skipping the chapter on how to rename folders and adding some extra programming information would have been good...) and like another reviewer, I wish the code examples were explained better.I would recommend this book as ancillary to more comprehensive programming manuals."
1,buy Hillegass instead,"This book is upperquartile (as books of this type go). It has many good points. But it has one fatal drawback: there is a much better book available. Hillegass (1) is a professional trainer with oodles of classroom experience and that shines through in his book - he trained many of the Apple coders who now work on Cocoa, (2) has been involved with Cocoa from its inception. As icing on the cake, the 3rd ed of his book is up-to-date (2008), whereas this is not.I ploughed through Garfinkel and Mahoney first (on the strength of the O'Reilly reputation and good experiences with other O'Reilly books). I still did not understand Cocoa particularly well. Then I ploughed through several hundred pages of the Applie Guides. Finally, I bought Hillegass. I wish I had found it first. The Apple guides, or some of them, are quite good, but you need a good grounding first."
3,Should have been a lot thicker...,"I have to admit that this was the book that finally got me over the newbie hump, but it took a lot more work on my part than it should have. I would definitely recommend looking at the ""unconfirmed error reports"" page at O'Reilly, to benefit from the efforts of many readers who have updated, corrected, and clarified this book. Still, it is frustrating to read the end of chapter assignments because of the knowledge gap between the text and the questions. I would consider this less of a complete course and more of a guide, leaving it to you to fill in with knowledge from other sources."
2,Ok book. Loses the forrest for the trees at times,This is a good book for a serious civil war fan. It is full of troop movement descriptions and landmarks that without diagrams make understanding battle sequences difficult to follow. This is not a biography as it appears. It is a military journal. I was dissapointed.
1,Fell apart after one season,This canner developed holes and rust after less than one season of canning. The rack inside is flimsy as discussed by others. It rusts after a few canning sessions.
4,Pleased,I am very pleased with this product. It made canning much easier than the method I was using before. No initial problems.
4,Water bath canner,"Item was delivered on time. However there was a dent on the edge of the lid and the lip of the canner pot. Since time was of the essence, I kept it. That's my reason for the 4 star rating.If you're canning tomatoes, this item works perfectly well, and the price is right."
3,Take care of it,"This is a very nice size large pot. It holds 7 qt bottles comfortably. My mistake was leaving water in the pot with the rack. The very next day, the rack was showing signs of rust. Also the lid shows 2 places where the paint (enamel) has cracked and peeled off.It will still do the job, but you have to handle it carefully if you want it to stay looking nice."
1,Takes the fun out of canning...,"Poor quality and poorly packaged... Perfect combination for it to arrive bent and with chipped enamel. Complained to the vendor and never got a reply back. Will not buy again... Included rack is useless, I had to buy a separate, better one..."
3,Pot great... rack CORRODED right away,"I began canning last year, and needed a larger pot for this season. This pot is great! The rack however, not so great. It immediately corroded in the first use. The second time I canned, all of my jars came out with a nasty white film on them. Now I've got to buy a stainless steel or some other corrosion resistant rack to use."
4,Canner,"Having a canner is like stepping back in time, but well worth all of your efforts in the end. This canner is a quality product, evenly coated with enamel. The rack, included, seems as though it's sturdy and of good construction."
1,You don't need one,"I'm a beginner canner and have been looking into the different supplies needed- including a water bath system. After reading the reviews on this product I went to a local store and checked them out. The negative reviews were confirmed- these are very flimsy and cheap, even the one I was looking at was all dinged up and damaged. I went home and looked into it and it turns out you can use any large pot for water bath canning so long as you have something between the bottom of the pot and the glass jars (connecting some canning bands together seems to be the cheapest and easiest option). Although you miss out on having a rack that you can elevate and rest on the pot- I don't think I'd trust this cheap rack to elevate seven quart jars anyways. I thought this information might be helpful to anyone who doesn't have a lot of extra storage space for a really big pot but wants to start canning, like me!"
3,Waterbath Canner,"This canner is good for tomatoes and fruits. It holds 7 of the larger jars and has a rack. The color matches my kitchen decor well and so I also use it for decoration if the off season. The lid and pan are sturdy and after proper shipping it had no dents or dings. The USFDA does not reccommend this type of canning for foods with low acidity, however border line items, such as tomotoes, you can add a minimal amount of lemon juice to increase this and it does not affect flavor. This product is fairly light weight, especially considering the size. Make sure yours comes with a rack!"
3,Not the best for home brewing.,"Got this thinking it would be a cheap alternative for home brewing. It was to some extent, all the ingredients fit well and it's width made stirring easy. However, the bottom is indented in and so if you have an electric or even gas stove your boil may not get hot enough for all the malt and other fermentables. If you are doing home brewing just spend the extra cash and get a stainless steel pot"
4,Good CD but...,"Let me preface everything by saying that this is a great CD as far as the vocals and production go. This may be his best produced CD to date. Well, why did I not give it 5 stars? I am just more accustomed to the diverse styles included on his past cd's (R&B, Hip- Hop, Soul, Praise & Worship, Reggae, Pop, etc.) Barring a couple of tracks, this CD primarily has simply a laid back R&B feel. He does an excellent job perfecting that feel, but I was looking for a something a little more eclectic. Plus, as a musician, I would like to have heard a few tracks with more live instruments."
5,My wife loves it!,Makes for a great gift! My wife absolutely loves this show! I got it on black friday so the price was right
5,A Lohengrin for the ages,"This is the Lohengrin of all time. After having listened to this performance for many years on LP, I am thrilled to have it on CD as well. James King has a voice of bronze and Janowitz is an angel as Elsa. The supporting cast is wonderful as is the orchestral playing."
4,Now I want to learn Sanskrit,"A rather heady linguistic work. At times I find myself drowning in a jargon which I don't speak, but at other times, I find myself seeing linguistic connections that I was never aware of (or not a conscious level). Some of the patterns enumerated are ones that have entered my intuitive understandings of language, but seeing them explicitly defined helps me understand why they work the way that they do. I find myself interested in learning Sanskrit after reading through this book. I'll have to look into auditing something at CGS when I get the chance."
2,heavy interrupted reading,"if what you want is extreme detail, then this is the book for you. i myself found it hard to follow as every sentence is at least three lines long and interspersed with constant parenthetical notes that sometimes themselves take up three lines!"
3,It can be Better!,"I brought this product for my mom on christmas coming from differnt generations of sony WEGA's and Sony Trinitron with surround systems it was a surprise to me that being a high tech product it doesnt come with features that other tv sets do have, like picture in picture. but still it's worth the price.Israel H. MontillaSanto Domingo, Dominican Republic"
2,Eh....,"The only saving grace for this film was Tim Curry playing the perfect ringmaster of a sideshow. One of the sideshow freaks is the wolf girl, who's really just a young woman covered with hair...she puts in fake fangs and claws and growls a lot for her act. Four ne'er-do-well heckel her and the rest of the sideshow during it's stay. Meanwhile, a young outcast pities the wolf-girl and gives her a serum his scientist mother made that may make her normal. As she continues to use the ""medicine,"" though, we find that it has a reverse effect: the more human she appears, the more animal she becomes.That sounds interesting, but it could've been done better...maybe without using full frontal (doctored?) male nudity? Plus, I like my werewolf movies to have werewolves. The cover is VERY misleading, there is no large beast in this film. The only beasts are the heckling teenagers."
5,The Old Boys can Still Deliver,"I saw parts of this show on tv and had to get the dvd. Tight band includingDean Parks who played guitar with Steely Dan. He blends his talents nicelywith Crosby and Nash who sound as good as ever. Great song list with somenice surprises like Wind on the Water,the Byrds Eight Miles High andSimple Man. Some Hollies tunes would be nice. How about a Hollies Reunion?That would be nice. This dvd was well worth the price and gets repeated plays."
3,Disappointed - Picture and Audio Quality Lacking,"The performances are incredible. The picture and audio quality are abysmal, when compared to the quality of the performances. This was broadcast (live even, I believe) on HDNet. I've seen and heard higher quality on YouTube."
4,Robin Gibb: In Concert. A great addition for the Bee Gees fan.,"I received the DVD on time and in good condition. Like other people who ordered this concert DVD, I noticed that it did not offer 5.1 surround sound as the packaging claims. However, the concert was well worth it. The setting was beautiful and the music was very good as well. Robin had a way of appearing a bit ""stiff"" on stage but this time he actually appeared to be enjoying himself. Now that he is gone (along with his brothers Maurice and Andy) I am glad I purchased this DVD while I had the opportunity. God bless you, Robin."
5,A Must-Have for a lovers of classical guitar,"The first piece I heard on this recording was the Beethoven Moonlight Sonata. I was hooked from that point on, as were a boatload of listeners (I do the morning show for a classical station in Dallas). The disc is well-recorded, with very little finger squeek that can be so annoying on guitar discs. Ben Tobiasson has a sweet touch on the frets. Bring on more, Ben!"
3,"I love it, but for completionists only","Plot, such as it is: Alf is being held in some kind of ""alien detention center,"" led, evidentally, by the totally unnecessary Martin Sheen. And a couple of underlings kidnap Alf to freedom. That's it. One wishes desperately for Willie and the rest of the Tanners, but we're told, ""they're in a gov't protection/relocation thing in Iceland, because they like the school system there."" There is a good scene where Alf winds up in some ""G"" rated...""dance-pole"" bar, and asks the waiteress for some sort of (running joke) ""cat"" dish. That's it. Still, when shows with bald twits hosting ""Deal Or No Deal"" or Paula ""Oh I'm so giggly"" Abdul's version of Star Search are the norm - ANYTHING ""Alf"" is a blessed relief. ""Alf"" was the only justification for even owning a television in the eighties, so go on, DO complete your collection like I did."
2,"It was the Clash, NOT THE WHO!","Rebecca, you need a new editor. Pervail? It's PREVAIL. And ""Should I stay or should I go now?"" That was not the Who. I have never read a book with such jarring writing-- are we in the past or the present? Please pick one.That aside, the story is pretty bad, too. Is Molly a tough LA girl or a wussy mama's girl from Idaho? Make up your mind, Molly. By the end of the book, I still don't like you or your loser boyfriend.That said, I still had to read the whole thing, because I had to know what happened at the end. I guess that's why this book gets two stars instead of one for readability."
2,La Bella Figura means: shallow but pleasant,"La 'bella figura' is the concept of putting on a pleasing appearance, regardless of how shallow an affectation it may be.Unfortunately, this same idea of shallowness dressed up in a pretty package describes the entire book--which is charmingly written but comes across as a facile, patriotic celebration of bogus 'Italianness'. It upholds every stereotype of ""theme park Italia"" you've ever encountered. Italy has existed for less than 200 years, but the author seems barely aware of this fact. If Walt Disney produced a treatise on Italy--this would be it!"
2,Silly stereotypes,"I really enjoyed Severgnini's ""Ciao, America"" and was looking forward to reading what he had to say about Italians at home. What a let-down! If a non-Italian had written this, everyone would be yelling that it was stereotyped and insulting. It's a series of gross generalizations about Italians that provides almost no insights into the country and culture. There were a few valuable moments but not nearly enough to make up for the many pages of triteness. I think I'll stick to the author's political and economic commentary."
1,Another useless generalization,"Another useless generalization, and a series of stereotypes, for the Anglo-Saxon audience that, however, seems to love this type of literature. The usual trivialities written by somebody who seems to understand it all (good for him). As usual, realities are different, more complicated, and moreover more varied. The South is once more treated with superficiality, lack of real understanding, and a subtle prejudice, as it is usually the case in this type of books written by northerners. It can make an amusing reading, for sure, but do not assume anything written in it is what you will actually see in Italy. It is just like somebody wanting to explain you as Americans really are in a few hundred pages with the only authority of being American (and maybe just from New York), and still pretending to understand it all."
3,Overkill,First let me say I love the 4 Seasons. Saw them live a couple of times in the late 60's and early 70's. Unfortunately there are a lot of songs on this box that would be best left forgotten. There are hit collections that do them better justice for less money.
3,It is good when I bought,"BackPackIt is very good when I bought. 2 weeks ago, the bell (sewing ) behind the packback came off. I can't do at hoem , so I brought to the alteration to fix, cost me extra $10.00 .ince I bought just couple months ago, the sewing doesn't strong enough. It needs to be sew more . Overall it is Ok, don't know how long the sewing last ; hope not to spend more $$$ to fix iat again."
2,check the studies!,"The studies were done with 176.5 mg of extract per day. That's roughly 12 of these pills per day.""Satiereal, a Crocus sativus L. extract, reduces snacking and increases satiety in a randomized placebo-controlled study of mildly overweight, healthy women."" Nutrition Research May 2010"
5,Corey makes meatballs an even better movie,"I loved all of the meatballs, but this one is one of the greatest, it was so funny and Corey Feldman really made the movie great, he gave a good perfomance, I must say this is a must see movie, its a great movie to put on and watch and keep you smiling!"
3,Not the correct size described on website,"I returned this product because it was more than an inch bigger all way around. Other than that, it seemed fine."
1,Most defective product I've ever bought,"I've bought this chronically defective toothbrush and had it replaced three separate times. Each time, I received a brand new replacement, and each time, it broke within 3 days.Works great, lovely design, for the 48 hours you'll have it working. I opened up the case after the third time it stopped working, and realized it's sloppily assembled.It's pathetic that Target would ever sell a brush like this, I've refused to go to Target stores ever since. And Phillipe Starck should be ashamed of himself. He should be saying, -In the future, there will be less of my breakable products-"
4,Shows the seamy side of the average joe,"A good, easy to follow mystery with an insiders look at heartless large law firm. I found the main character, Mac, to be depressing. Nothing ever seems to go right for him and he abuses every opportunity that he has, including the ultimate opportunity. This book has the best line ever written about the relationship between a law firm and the general counsel of a client corporation"
2,Endless Ruminating By Main Character = BORING!,"Scott Turow is brilliant, which is why I can't understand shy he writes some drivel (like this book, for instance). The plot is so thin that the story could be told in 1/5th of the time. The book is simply chockfull of ambience - i.e. the ""hero's"" thoughts and meandering actions. By the time I got to the conclusion I just didn't care about the who-did-what. Unless you love endless digression, avoid this book."
2,Pleading Guilty - Scott Turow,"The first twenty pages of any novel I read, I decide whether to continue on or not. Normally I read a little more before my decision, giving the author the benefit of the doubt. At page fifty-seven I decided to shelf this book, eventually ending up as a donation to my Public Library; perhaps someone else may enjoy it. It bores me to death when there are paragraphs of long monologues sandwiched between short dialogues, rendering me to lose the trend of the subject. I cannot, in all honesty, not recommend this book, for someone else may like it. It was not my style, unhappy to say."
3,page turner...disappointing conclusion,"this is an interesting novel that ultimately disappoints. How to end the novel?it's a tough job for any author ...Turow fails here. But, this novel is well worth the time put into it. It's a good airplane novel...or beach novel. You gobble it up like peanuts at the ballgame."
5,Dissolution never felt so good,"Okay, first off I am a Scott Turrow fan. That said, I really liked this story. I could relate to the main character and he get's to really stick it to the man! In the process, he also sticks it to just about everybody around him."
1,Typical run of the mill trash book,"The idea of the lead character narrating the story on audio tape just didn't work. Scott Turow couldn't stick with a subject for more than 1/2 a page without regressing back to another subject for three or four pages before getting back to the point he was trying to make in the first place. He did this over and over. Just like many other authors that have nothing much to say, he covered all the ""hot"" topics of lesbianism, male homosexuality, mafia, drunkeness, and even masturbation. This is a ten page, poorly written story which Mr. Turow managed to stretch into 464 pages. If you really enjoy reading take a wide pass on the one."
5,THE BEST Straight to DVD Releases from Disney.,"When Aladdin II Return of Jafar came out years ago, I thought that the idea that Disney would release some of their films straight to the consumer was a sour one. Aladdin III did not help change that opinion to much though it was better. Mulan II is by far the best Straight to DVD/VHS release Disney has ever done. Why on earth did they not release it to theaters as well though. The story is funny, thought provoking, and above all flawless. It is a shame it is not longer. The songs are also great, but then Disney is well known for combining lyrical song with story very well, at least in most cases."
3,Alright....,"The music in this sequal is nothing compared to the first movie, but the tunes are catchy, and for a child that just enjoyed the movie, I could see how this would be a CD they'd want to hear over and over. It could get a bit annoying to their parents however. I would suggest seeing the movie before purchasing this soundtrack, for the songs are out of order from the movie, and it's always better to have a visual of what's going on before listening to the music alone.I wasn't impressed, but I did enjoy it."
3,A little disappointing,"The title of this book is very misleading. I would recommend reading the Editorial Comment before buying the book. Then you will have an idea of what to expect. Basically, the editor says that this volume contains stories of murder (and psychological effects) rather than mystery and suspense. A few of the stories are excellent but the rest just average."
2,No Mysteries Here,"Like the previous reviewer, I agree that there are few mysteries to this book. I read last years (2000)collection and really enjoyed it. However, 2001's collection is lacking in suspense, and seems to have the common notes of family/suffering/bleakness. Don't waste your money on the hardcover (like I did) if you are expecting short stories of mysteries and suspense."
3,worth watching,"It did get a little dry and generic. Some of the comics ran out of material and I didn't necessarily agree with the matchups, but one of the comedians was just hilarious and the extras made it funny enough to be worthwhile."
1,knee high boots,"upon arrival of the boots i discovered they just did not fit, trying to contact amazon or the seller was one ""wall"" after another, so i had to suck up the cost and now have a closet ornament instead of a pair of boots."
3,Just for fun,"These boots are as shown, except that the blue is a bit darker. A lot of fun, but the heel is a bit clunky and they do slide on the floor, so you need to add some rubber sole. I have never walked too far in them, always get compliments when I wear them, but you can see the quality is not great. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend if you are looking for something fun rather than sophisticated, for a good price."
2,"If you're not model-thin, these won't fit your claf","I bought size 8 White PU, and when they arrived in the mail I promptly tried them on. In the foot they fit fine, though a bit snugly, but when I tried to zip them up they were too small! I have about a 14in calf--average for women in the US is 13 to 14 inches. One would think that as shoe size goes up the calf size in the boot would be bigger, but according to a rep I emailed all of them are 13-inches around. Also, at least in the model I want, they don't come in a larger calf size. I will not be ordering from this company again."
2,not so great.,"1. the headers actually have somewhat of clearance issues, when the motor goes in reverse the 1/2 inch clearance causes grinding.2. The existing heat shield can not be reused, and the headers will also easily overheat your cruise control unit, and you will lose cruise control if you don't exhaust heat wrap to protect your engine bay from the extra hear3. These are the cheap black painted ones, go with the armor coated, the black paint actually burns off within minutes of the car heating up, and leaves these pipes looking hideous.4. the relocation of the o2 sensor may be slightly to far for your factory o2 sensor, not only do you have to pull the whole harness to make it connect, it also will set o2 bank 1 service engine soon light, for delayed response times. so you will have to upgrade to a faster o2 sensor.----1. They improve cars acceleration response, id say if you gutt your catalytic converter when you put the header on you gain about 8 hp. =]"
5,Dry Lips,This is the best product I've found for dry lips. There's no wax to further dry one's lips nor menthol that burns.
4,"It is very moisturing, but over price","My wife likes it, and I think it is OK. But you pay close to $10 for this thing"
1,Very disappointed,"I had heard great things about this but I didn't have any luck with it. At first, it just didn't moisturize. My lips would feel dry again within an hour of reapplying. After about a week, I realized it was actually drying out my lips. ( This only ever happened before with Burt's bees so it's probably not a sensitivity issue.) I then used Neosporin overnight lip treatment to restore my lips back to normal."
2,Not as expected,The color and construction is more of plasticy green than grey leather. Does not look like the color in the picture.
3,Very Narrow,"I received these boots as a gift. They appeared to be well-made attractive boots, but when I slipped them on it was like putting my foot in a vise. The boots were size 12D which is supposed to be medium width. These fit more like a C or or smaller. I returned them and the gift-er got a quick refund from Amazon."
2,Not real good!,Install and set up was a bit confusing. Had to contact tech. support (not real friendly or warm). We were looking to save time for data entry. We realized with much frustration typing was faster and more accurate. When scanning e-mail addresses the error rate was about 40% on a font size 6. Scanning 8 and above error rate went down to about 25%. Correcting the errors the pen made took more time then it was worth. The concept is great but does need allot of improvement.
2,Wicom SuperPen pro,"I am really disappointed with the item.The wireless feature is NOT really wireless. You can only beam about 10 -20 words via infrared.With all the new technology it is way behind the consumer expectations that you still have to use a cable to transfer data. I can not see that it would take that much to fix the problem, so the enduser will be able to use the infrared for data transfers. I wonder if they never heard about bluetooth technology either.It takes some time to get used to the pen, scanner recognition is about 80% ok. IF YOU SCAN REALLY SLOW!For that the company calls them self ""world leader in personal, portable scanning pens"" I think that there is a lot of room for the competition to the real leader!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Unusable and Worthless,"Even after the supposed training of the pen, out of 20 scans it did not completely recognize the text once. It is very position sensitive and the technology needs to be significantly improved."
5,excellent compilation of trance tracks,one of the best compilations from the uk-based trance label platipus.a definate must-have for all trance music fans.
2,How to make a fictional stereotype into another fictional stereotype,"For people who haven't done the right thing and disconnected their cable, here's a reality check. Ladies watch more TV than guys do. Men do not need to know more about culture; they've actually done well in the area of literature, film, the visual arts etc. And gays are not really that neat or obsessed with Bette Midler. Is your self-help book inane enough? Are you?"
1,THIS BOOK LACKS ALOT OF INFORMATION FOR THE SCHOLAR,"THE AUTHOR HAS GOOD INTENTIONS AND MAY EVEN SATISFY THE CURIOUSITY OF THE READER WHO WANTS TO TOUCH THE SURFACE ON THIS SUBJECT,BUT THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO DO SERIOUS RESEARCH ON NEWAGE RELIGION INVADING OUR CHRISTIAN HERITAGE, THE BOOK JUST DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE CHAPTER TITLES, IT IS MORE LIKE ONE BIG COMPLAINT RATHER THAN AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE."
3,Tabloid history,"Let's face it, any book with the word 'EVIL' emblazoned on the cover in 3-inch-high letters is probably going to have an agenda. It reads like the National Enquirer of historical figures. Granted, few listed in this book would be considered 'nice guys' by anyone's standards, but most are far too complex to be adequately represented in this rather one-dimensional study. Instead it focuses strictly on the dirt, and dirt is what sells. Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining light reading, but don't come away thinking you've read any sort of in-depth biography.BTW - It's my personal belief that history has been unfairly unkind to Rasputin. The image of an illiterate drunken rake stems from the slander spread by jealous Russian nobles before the revolution, and the Soviets saw fit to not contest it."
2,Ok at best,"This book may come across as interesting, but that's purely because of the subject matter. The writing is pretty poor, and the grammar is horrible. The author jumps around a bit and writes things in a confusing manner. The book tends to lack in explaining why some of these people are evil. Fortunately, it has a Bibliography, so one can do further research into these icons."
2,I would have to agree with the 1st reviewer,"This dvd definately sucks, i should have learned my lesson after i got the women of starbucks, but i actually leanred more in this one... no just kidding. This one had a crappy start, just goto the scene selection and skip to the end thats where they show all of the really ""good"" stuff if you know what i mean. Same with the starbucks one.Also this is playboy, playboy is more like ""art"" i guess more than pr0n so if you are looking for the good stuff please learn some common sense."
2,Info is great,"I happen to meet this man at class I took recently. Although I did not care of the author, his knowledge and talent is superb. This book is a great for a quick and easy reference book. Although I don't necessarily agree with some of his methods, they seem a little antiquated. Perhpas that is why he too was in the class. As I said it is a good, short, quick and esay reference guide to plants. Not much detail. There are better books out there. So if you are looking for detailed information this is not the book. If you want deatiled info try reading Jeanne Rose's books."
5,"If you have a shedding dog, you need this!","I have a German Shepherd who was leaving clumps of fur all over the house. Combing him out barely made a difference. My sister recommended Lipoderm to me. After about three weeks of giving it to my dog in his food, I began noticing a major improvement in his coat and a significant decline in shedding. Now, after 5 weeks, his coat is shiny, soft and beautiful with almost no shedding. What a difference! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has similar dog shedding issues."
2,Kids get tired of waiting,"Ready to use right out of the box, nothing to assemble! It does take longer to get to a gummy stage than the directions say. At eight minutes, the refrigerated snack is not ready. If you try to take the snack out of the mold too soon to roll it in the sugar, it just won't work. Putting it in the freezer seems to work better.You have to get two AAA batteries and use a screwdriver to get Scooby-Doo to give his chatter while waiting for the snack. Scooby serves as a timer for the snacks, so isn't absolutely essential.It's easy to wash up afterwards, but takes too long to jell to the proper consistency."
3,This toy is disappointing,Just finished using it and I wish Santa had not brought it. It is very easy to use but the end product does take much longer to prepare than stated in the directions and what is made does not taste good. Even to a 5 yr old who was dying to eat it. Don't waste your money. At least the Easy Bake Oven product tastes good when you are finished.
5,Excellent for abandoned cutting edge worship!,"I have been following Kevin and his music for a while. ALL the songs he has written are birthed out of real life experiences...both good and bad. There is life flowing from his songs. This Album is summed up in its title...RECLESS MERCY. the music itself is as always excellent with the FUNKAAY rythms of Martin Neil, and others. From the heartfelt croons of Kevin to the intoxicating rythms of Martin its a true mix of skilfulness and real worship. You'll never hear ""o come let us adore Him like this ANYWHERE else. If they're playin in your area, DROP ALL OTHER PLANS AND ATTEND. I haven't heard a single song on any of Kevins albums that i did not like. SURE BUY."
3,Supernova,"Purchase was excellent. This movie is terrible. I knew that before hand though, I bought it for horrible movie night."
5,"Great film, innovative plot, superb acting","Very pleasantly surprised by the intelligence of this film. DVD is essential viewing and makes much more sense, the ending is a real kicker (see Deleted Scenes).All time favorite."
5,Superb Sci-Fi,"Supernova offers a great plot and flawless acting, reinforced by stunning animation. The whole ship is so believable that it makes you feel on board! However, if you don't like hard-core sci-fi you might miss the story, because it is stuffed with hi-tech terms and scientific hypotheses that general public finds hard to digest. Some say the movie needed 5 more minutes at the end to explain what's going on; others say it's just a mild horror flick in sci-fi candy-wrapping ;-) In my humble writer's opinion, it has everything a good sci-fi movie needs. As for the ""missing"" end, I think it's all left up to you--the viewer--to fill in the blanks. BTW, if you watch the deleted scenes you'll see precisely why they were deleted with BIG scissors. To me, the story is very fresh and the acting is superb!"
2,Supersnore,"Well made but bland, this movie put tMoBY to sleep. Nothing surprising here, you've seen it all in the previews, if that weren't bad enough; they give you the super fast version when the crew goes into 'warp'. I'd give it a D but I liked some of the performances. C-"
1,Supernova in the classroom,Does anyone know if there is a real PG-13 version of this film? I've been told it came out as a PG-13 and then was changed to an R film. Pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see...
3,NOT SO SUPER NOVA,"Riddled with production difficulties and the bailing out of noted director Walter Hill, SUPERNOVA ends up a confusing, muddled and ultimately disappointing film. The biggest problem for me is that I never truly understood just what was in the alien artifact, and also the dramatic change in appearance of Karl Larson after he is shot. There is an unusual amount of meaningless sex and nudity scenes, almost as if they were used purely for padding and lustful viewers.Peter Facinelli, looking and sounding amazingly like Tom Cruise, commands his scenes with a suave menace. James Spader is too inanimate to be likeable; Angela Bassett is too cold to be sympathized with. Robin Tunney and Lou Diamond Phillips are likewise annoyingly cloy. The movie has some tense moments, but it is so miswritten and directed, it only gets three stars for the fact that It held my interest longer than I thought it would."
3,Entertaining formula passes time well,"What do you want? Everything can not be new or innovative and everyone can not be a superstar. The formula has always worked before. You pick up something in space and it eats your lunch. I did not see any cardboard looking props and the actors do not out act the characters.Look how far the actors have come. Robin Tunney has grown up and looks cuter than in ""The Craft"" (see my review December 22, 2000.) Lou Diamond Philips can make more faces (expanded expressions) than he did in ""Bats"" (see my review August 25, 2000.)This movie has all the elements necessary for today's formula space ""Who's next to get it?"" film. You truly have several chances to say stay in the car (oops ship)."
3,both movies dont work,"When I received this movie, dawn of the dead skips a lot and there isnt any scratches on the disk. Land of the dead works fine so that's why I'm giving them 3 stars. At least it didn't cost much!"
3,"A BEST OF FOR DEBORAH, BUT NOT A GREAT CD","""I Can See Clearly"", ""I Love With Love"", ""French Kissin in the USA"", ""Free to Fall"", and ""Rock Bird"", are the only songs worth repeat listenings. ""I Can See.."", is from the horrible DEBROVATIONS (1 Star), the other before mentioned are from RPCKBIRD (4). Rest of the songs, are plain filler."
3,no plush waistband here,"The quality of the fishnet part of the tights is good, but I am disappointed at their false advertisement of a ""plush 1"" waistband"" as it is neither plush nor 1"". I was looking for fishnets with a more comfortable waistband, but these are not them, and I am beginning to think they don't exist."
5,A Great Read!,"I read this book recently during a series of long flights on Delta Airlines. One of Delta's music features available on their headset selection at the time was ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" which I listened to while reading ""Samsara."" It was a perfect match to the text. Lewis is great at both characterization and suspense.I'm personally preoccupied with the concept of joss and write about it myself in a somewhat different sense than Lewis does. So, if you don't know your joss, then you need read this book to find out what it is. Highly recommended."
5,A pure classic,"One of my all time favorite Godzilla films; Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla should be in the collection of ANY Godzilla fan. The acting is actually above par for a G film, which is a nice change of pace, but the real treat is the introduction of one of the best enemies in Godzilla history; Mechagodzilla, plus the introduction (and only appearance up until Final Wars) of the fan favorite King Cesar(sorry on official spelling). The end fight between Godzilla and his mechanical alter ego, is one of my favorites."
2,Has Godzilla finally met his match?,"Summary: It's Godzilla meets Godzilla when the King of the Monsters does battle with a robot clone of himself.Despite the above average monster effects, script, acting and score, there's something about this movie that just keeps it from being a Godzilla classic. Two and a half stars would be a more appropriate rating. Certainly worth viewing.Next is ""Terror of Mechagodzilla""."
3,i dont know why amazon,"i didnt buy this but amazon wanted me to review it, lol.so i have no idea, ive never seen it."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"It's a very good movie but not ""the best film ever made"". For one thing, Angurus deserve a bigger part. They could of kicked King Caesar out and have Angurus help Godzilla trash MechaGodzilla. Asoul the aliens looked like gorillas from ""Planet of The Apes"" (1968), ""Beneath The Planet of The Apes"" (1970), ""Conquest of The Planet of The Apes"" (1972) and ""Battle For The Planet of The Apes"" (1973). And King Caesar, well let's just say he's not one of Toho's cash cows. But MechaGodzilla was great. And Toho made a good sequel to it called ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"" (1975). I suggest you buy this instead of that Tristar crap."
3,Boring at sometimes,Boring at sometimes but other than others. Godzilla's appearance was a little better though. Anguirus and King Caesar had smaller parts in it but it returned an old monster and introduced a kinda cheezy and helpless new monster.
5,Robot Godzilla,"One of the best of the original series, with a fast-moving plot. Mechagodzilla is an effective villain and though that king-god creature comes across as a combination of the Cowardly Lion and Crash Bandicoot it's a memorable monster and the scenes showing its release from the rocks are excellently well-handled."
2,Not sturdy enough,"This is a terrible dough blender. This is very flimsy and there is no rigidity to the ""blades"" (which are really just bent wire), so everything bends and the dough just gets caught. I always wound up just using a fork to blend with since this was so terrible. I now have a dough blender from the pampered chef that is very sturdy and has more of a bladed edge to it. It is so much easier to use. I would definitely NOT recommend the Oxo model."
3,Source for Hervey Allen's ANTHONY ADVERSE,"This memoir was the source for the character of Vincent Nolte in the novel ANTHONY ADVERSE. In the 1937 film version by Warner, he was played by actor Donald Woods."
2,they sent product that is definitely old,I have used this product for over 5 years and I like it. I have ordered enough of it to know when it is old and when it is fresh. Fresh works much better. I will think and shop around to get it somewhere else if that if their quality.
2,Beware if you have sensitive skin,This product burned my skin and left it red and crusty. Be careful if your skin is sensitive as mine is. And I used only a little dab as instructed.
5,Anointed Worship,"I received this cd 10-11-2006 and have already listened it 3 times and recommended it to about 5 people and here I am recommending it to you. Buy it, you will not be disappointed. It is awesome...the presence of the Lord comes through in every song. My favorites are tracks 9 - 20. Awesome, simply awesome and anointed!"
2,Neither a good poker or business book,"The book has some interesting stories and ideas but I didn't leave convinced of the connection between ""investing"" and poker. Maybe I had over inflated expectations, but this books title is a bit off-target."
3,Very expensive,"I bought the Cuisinart Ice Cream maker at Sam's Club for $49.95 and it's a great machine. However, a second bowl for 92% of the the entire machine price is too expensive. For another $5 it is worth it to purchase a SECOND machine, and either 1) Just use the bowl for a second batch or, 2) Make two batches simultaneously."
5,Police Business by Julie Miller,"I'm about halfway through the series and so far this one is my favorite. I bought this book because it was recommended on the romance discussion board. I really loved both main characters. I really felt Claire's struggle to make her father and those around her take her seriously, so she could lead her own life. I wanted to shake her father and those around her for not believing she witnessed a murder thus endangering her life. I loved that A.J. believed her and was there to watch out for her. He also has struggles of his own such as the thirteen year age difference between him and Claire and their very different backgrounds.The book was well written. I loved and was cheering for both the main characters and the plot was interesting from start to finish. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in May/Demember relationships and romantic suspense novels."
3,Don't need to buy with 55-200 VR,"If you're like me, you may buy this unnecessarily. The 55-200 DX VR already comes with a hood, but this is listed as a recommended accessory with lens by Amazon. It won't let the lens operate thru the whole zoom range when installed in storage mode (reversed). This may provide some incidental protection to the zoom mechanism from accidental bumping when not in use. Just a guess.Otherwise works as it should, just not necessary unless you want a scalloped hood. You probably already know all of this if you do.So, hopefully I just saved you some cash."
3,More form than function,"I bought this hood to accompany the hood included with my 55-200mm lens. The major flaw is that the lens will not zoom through its full range, as the hood is somewhat narrower than the kit hood, and binds at around 70mm. Also, with the hood reversed you cannot use the focus ring (true of the included hood too). The focus ring is only an issue if you shoot a lot with the hood reversed, but the binding can be an issue for some who need the lens to store more compactly."
3,Nikon HB Lens hood for 55-200mm,"This hood shown is not what I received, the one I received is straight edged all around. You should advertise what you supply."
2,Sent it back for a refund.,"I already had the hood that came with the 55-200mm VR lens but I wanted to check this one since it has a nicer shape. The first flaw I noticed was it's locking system, it feels very flimsy and cheap compared to my other Nikon hoods. Another deal breaker was that putting the hood in reverse (in storage position) I couldn't close the lens completely. I sent it back for a refund and I'll stay with the one that came with the lens, it might not be as cool looking as this one but it works and works well."
3,About two or three good remixes.,The rest of the EP is J.G. Thirwell's repetitive tracks which are more of slight variations to the tracks as opposed to remixes.3/5
4,good and cheap,I am replacing my old disks at one/tenth the original price and have yet to have a problem.
3,o screaming slave,"I just got the cd today and the first hearing was pretty harsh. I wasnt too thrilled with the last 3 mixes, especially screaming slave. Like most reviews say, screaming slave is basically all noise. There arent many words on these tracks- sounds something that you would hear at a undergound club. I usually like most of trent's work- maybe i will feel differently after a couple more plays. However I know i will def not be listening to screaming slave anytime soon.I really dont recommend this for someone that is just starting to listen to NIN. This is very raw industrial music"
2,unsatisfied,the book is a collection of recipes from book that do not even come close to be The Year's Top. NOT RECOMMENDED
3,Elvis,"I enjoyed the cd. There are a few songs that could have been left out, but for the most part an Elvis fan will enjoy the cd."
3,licensed aesthetician,"I had high expectations for this product. I was a little disappointed that it didn't perform as well as I thought it would. It's the only retail item that I've found with recorsinol, a peeling agent. It did dry out a cystic blemish, but it still took along time to completely heal. I was looking for a miracle product, I guess there is no such product!"
1,didn't work,I read on several blogs that this was great for cystic acne. I found that it didn't really work. It is also a really weird color to have on your face.
5,I found a broker for my products!!,"I am a small business owner who was interested in finding a broker,in Benin West Africa, for my products. I purchased this directory and found a potential broker. I contacted him and did an international credit check. This business had excellent credit and references and I shipped my products and within 12 days had a request for additional material. I purchased this publication ... and consider it an excellent investment.This is a necessity for American businesses that want to do business in Africa."
2,Canning rack is PAINTED!,"I would give this canner 5 stars but have to ding 3 stars for the painted, not plated, canning rack. The photo submitted was taken after it's third use. I won't be returning the canner because I need it and will strip the remaining paint from the rack."
3,Better canner for 1/2 pint jars,"I like this canner fine for 1/2 pint canning, but i can't keep a roaring boil with 1 pint jars and the lid intact without water boiling out onto the stove. For that reason, I'm getting the 21 quart size (which i prob should have done originally) with the added bonus of canning the quart size occasionally."
5,Perfect Size,This is the perfect size canner for pint and smaller jars. It takes less water and heats up quickly. Works Great!
3,It's Ok,"I am not a canning expert and this was my first canning purchase; I don't have much to compare it to, but the other reviews did help make my decision. (Now I am wondering could I have accomplished the same task with a Dutch Oven and a pair of tongs??). We used it to can tomatoes. It does not have a lot of instructions (which was fine with me). It came to a boil easily and was easy to clean up. It stores easily with my other large pots and pans. I was a bit worried that the metal was too thin or that it would scratch my glasstop stove, but it worked just fine. The tomatoes sealed perfectly. This is probably a good purchase for a beginner - who does not like to read/need instructions. You may want to use guidelines found on the internet on how to can, I found several versions that worked well."
4,"pretty color ,quite large.",putting it together wasn't hard and looks very nice. If you have a large room it would work great. nice for the price.
5,MAGICAL,"It will cast a very magical spell over you, a wonderfully written story of a magical cafe`. You will be amazed at the magic that occurs. Cynthia Rylant does it again. Great, and amazing!"
5,My Favorite China Pattern,"The Lenox British Colonial Accessories Gold-Banded Bone China Sugar Bowl by Lenox & Lenox British Colonial Accessories Gold Banded Bone China Creamer by Lenox: The Lenox British Colonial ""Tradewind"" is my favorite china pattern. I was absolutely thrilled to complete my set with this sugar bowl & creamer. They are both surprisingly large. Larger than sugar bowls & creamers for most china patterns I have seen. Both pieces will match any three of the Lenox British Colonial Patterns (Shutter, Bamboo or Tradewind) perfectly! Originally from VA & now residing in FL, the British Colonial Tradewind pattern would fit in either setting. I just fell in love with this pattern the moment I saw it. The price through Amazon.com is very reasonable. As always, both pieces arrived well packaged & without any damage whatsoever. I highly recommend this lovely pattern just as I highly recommend Amazon.com!"
4,Pokemon FireRed / LeafGreen is so AWESOME!!!,"Hello everyone,My review of pkmn FireRed & LeafGreen is that they are the greatest pkmn video games ever made! I'm not kidding about this. Although I haven't actually bought one of these fantastic games yet, I have collected TONS of info on them. For instance, did you know that not only will gamers be able to capture all of the old 150 pkmn from the original pkmn Red & pkmn Blue, but gamers will also be able to capture many of the pkmn from pkmn Silver & pkmn Gold?!"
1,Pokemon Stinks,Havent the people that work for pokemon given up yet they need to give it up and get it through there head that pokemon is not cool they think just because they make 3waves of new pokemon that they will go back in business and they finally and wasnt pokemon made allready i know its kinda hard to keep track of theses stupid games but i know that there was already a pokemon red so why dont you pokemon fans go find something else to upses aboutand what is the differnce between pokemon green and pokemon fire anyways
4,A good buy.,"My wife and I recently purchased a bottle while in SW Texas. We grew both grew up on real Mexican vanilla bought on trips across the border, and were glad to find something at least close to that here at a very reasonable price. The smell and flavor are far and away better than what you'll get at the typical spice dept. in your grocery store.It is partially vanillin, but that should not have come as a surprise to anyone. It's clearly labeled such, even in the picture above. Even so, it's a good vanilla, even better at this price point."
5,Tastes great!,"A friend brought this back for me from Mexico and now, I can't go back to anything else. I even bought a very large bottle of 100% pure vanilla extract after my bottle of Molina was gone and could not bear it, I dumped it down the sink. I don't even want to try anything else."
2,Pretty Basic,This might be a good DVD to purchase if you are starting from zero. Anyone who isn't injured or under 45 will not benefit from these exercises.
2,The ANTON book is far superior,"We had to use this textbook for our linear algebra class. Heaven knows why they dropped using the Anton book in favor of this book. The book lacks in-depth examples when it comes to prooving/disproving vector spaces/subspaces. They also omit in-between steps when it comes to describing the solution of a problem. Sorry to say this but this book is cr-p! Even though this is our textbook for the class, I also have the Anton book and use that book to explain the concepts to me (that this book cannot). This book is only used in doing homework problems. All in all, very wordy and just not that good. Again, get the Howard Anton book ""even"" if you don't have to use that book for your course. They do a superior job in explaining Vector Spaces/Subspaces, etc... This book does a superior job of simply ""confusing"" someone. Even our teacher's not too crazy about this book but has to use it because the college picked it."
2,its okay,it was okay for the children they enjoyed the special effects even though it was really old school. Good for its time
2,way too heavy,"Oh my god it way to heavy for me and take a lot of wind to make it vibrate properly compare to the aluninium one , it always fall down the trumpet will not stay in the bell , i will not use it , lost money for me, may be there are some much better trumpeters than me that could use that mute but i would not suggest it to beginer like me."
4,Enlightening!,"Not as entertaining as Buddy Boys but definitely informative. Michael Dowd was a baaaaad man. He once went into a house that had been broken into, told the girl to wait outside, then went looking for stuff to steal himself. This is a must read for anyone who thinks of cops as saints. They're fallible just like everyone else, but worse, cuz they're in a position of power. This book had me laughing at just how foul this guy really was. I don't remember much about the good cop but he was persistent to catch the bad cop. I read this a long time ago so I'm kinda foggy but I do remember learning about NYPD procedures and its another good New York City read for those who can't get enough reading about true NYC crime. It takes you right into the hood and places you on dangerous corners, shows you how cops interact with the drug dealers, and names the bars that the dirty cops would hang out in. Its a good read."
3,hard to buckle,This is a pretty cover and its real soft but it makes it very hard to buckle the carseat belt cause it always slips down. If I would have known about this problem I would not have ordered it.
1,Not my best purchase,Terrible product. Cheaply constructed and could not get good reception no matter where I was with the radio. Plastic is cheap. Antennae lost its mooring on the inside of the radio.
2,A disappointment,"I've been buying and reading Randy's Doc Ford novels as soon as they are available for sale. I must say that I am disappointed in ""Dark Light"". The story line is very confusing. It tends to hop back and forth between Doc and the major protagonist Bern Heller. There's a mysterious woman who seems to disappear at the end of the story mysteriously and even more confusing is a woman that pops up out of nowhere at the end of the novel. Please, Randy. I realize that you had to deal with major hurricane damage to your property this past year. But now that you are beginning to write a new Doc Ford novel, please bring back the ""old Doc Ford"" we've come to know and love."
5,Robb Rocks (Again),"For those of you who have read the other books in this series, you should not have to ask. This book is great, just like the others by Robb. For the rest of you, if you like mystery, intrigue, and romance, read this series by J.D. Robb. It is a futuristic series about Eve Dallas, a New York City Police detective. In the fourteen books, we get to know her and her friends. If futuristic isn't your thing, this is not a sci-fi novel. It is a great series that never misses. READ IT!!"
5,Get this book NOW!,"I have bought and read all of the "".....In Death"" books and this is the best of the best! The excitement and nail biting is wonderful. The characters, especially Eve and Roarke, have really come along. This time, the bad guy is a woman and you will love hating her! Peabody gets a spotlight. But Eve and Roarke's first anniversary celebration will bring tears to ardent fans and the ballroom showdown is stupendous. What an entertaining series! How Nora keeps these fresh aside from her other novels is awesome. If you haven't read any of J. D. Robb's books, begin with ""Naked in Death"" and become addicted with the rest of us!"
3,reunion in death,"j.d.robb has done it once again.her work is only magical.and I love Peabody.she is such a kick in the pants.I really love how robb is bringing her out more.anyway, this is a great quick read, wonderful for a lazy afternoon at the beach or park. enjoy"
5,A wonderful book about the History of the Boston,"This is a great book about the background and breeding of Boston Terriers. If you are looking for a HOW TO book or a book about Caring for your Boston look elsewhere, but if you are looking into the history of the breed this is the book for you. LOTS of pictures of Champion dogs and pedigrees divided by 10 year sections and Top dogs of those years. I highly recommend it!"
3,A little disappointed,"This book contained an excellent review of the history of the breed. It is also full of wonderful color pictures. Beyond the breed's history and pictures though, the information is lacking. It reads pretty much like a long advertisement for the BTCA."
3,sometimes it dies,I love this hairdryer bedcause of the power. I love that it hangs on the wall but I've bought a couple of them and 2 out of 3 died in a short period. I don't know why??
4,Wall Mount Dryers,"More powerful than most wall mount models. Could be better is it had more heat but, still outperforms the smallerwall mounts"
3,"Dryer fine, the wall mount, not so much","The dryer itself works exactly as advertised. On the down side, the part that mounts to the wall and the hardware provided is a piece of junk. The instructions given to attach the unit to drywall first tell you to drill a hole that is far too small for the supplied inserts. Even more frustrating was the fact that the wall inserts were slightly different sizes, so if you drill a hole that fits the slightly larger (mind you, the size difference is not noticeable to your eyes, you need to use a micrometer) insert, the smaller insert is useless. The piece that holds the dryer is flimsy, and to remove the dryer you need to be cautious. Once this dryer dies, I won't be replacing it with the same dryer."
